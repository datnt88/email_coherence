<s> At our IETF working group meeting, a number of people pressed us to add security issues to the WEBDAV requirements document.  </s>
<s> There was a lot of concern that we are greatly expanding the opportunities for attack, but saying nothing about security.  </s>
<s> There was a sense that we need to say something about three separate areas: Authentication Access Control Interoperability with existing security protocols I took an action to start conversations on the mailing list on these topics, so let me do that.  </s>
<s> Authentication: WEBDAV should support Basic and Digest Authentication, just as HTTP 1.1 does.  </s>
<s> Anything beyond this?  </s>
<s> Access Control: WEBDAV should provide a way for authors to specify access control for resources that they create, within bounds set by the server administrator.  </s>
<s> A WEBDAV server should at a minimum be able to use the access control mechanisms provided by the operating system.  </s>
<s> It should also allow repositories standing behind it to use their own access control mechanisms.  </s>
<s> Interoperability with existing security protocols: WEBDAV should be able to interoperate with (which protocols?) to protect both client and server from attacks on their data, running applications, operating systems, and hardware; and to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit.  </s>
<s> What's different about WEBDAV that it should lead to more serious or different security problems than HTTP?  </s>
<s> We're encouraging people to publish via WEBDAV, and to publish work-in-progress.  </s>
<s> We're giving people new tools for organizing materials on the Web.  </s>
<s> Links are probably the most fundamental new factor we are introducing.  </s>
<s> Can we (should we) provide a means to limit who can link objects together?  </s>
<s> Who can put a link or any other metadata on a resource?  </s>
<s> Who can put a resource into a collection?  </s>
<s> If a resource belongs to several collections with different access control rules, which ones apply?  </s>

<s> Well, just to calibrate: I think from a user point of view, being able to say "this is public" or "this is private" for a new document the user has stored is far more important for DAV than being able to do "MOVE" or "COPY".  </s>
<s> Do you agree?  </s>
<s> A good question.  </s>
<s> At the risk of sounding evasive, I'd have to say "It depends".  </s>
<s> There are several scenarios I'm concerned about where the user will probably never want explicitly to alter access permissions on a document.  </s>
<s> For example, there are small departmental web servers where everything is always public to people in the department.  </s>
<s> Or there are situations where you have a private directory on a server, accessible only to you, where you author documents.  </s>
<s> When the document is finished you COPY it to a public area.  </s>
<s> In these scenarios MOVE and COPY are more important than the ability to specify public/private.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I agree that there are scenarios where the ability to specify public/private is really important.  </s>
<s> There are also scenarios where the ability to specify cache-control information is more important than either security or MOVE/COPY.  </s>
<s> And there are also situations where it's crucial that the user be able to say "Return this document if the requester supports frames, return this document if it doesn't."  </s>
<s> To me all of these situations are just variants on managing and administering a web server.  </s>
<s> That's why I'm reluctant to address security - I'm afraid it's the first step down a slippery slope.  </s>

<s> To me all of these situations are just variants on managing and administering a web server.  </s>
<s> This, IMHO, is the crux of the issue.  </s>
<s> It's a matter of proper balance between these needs in any given context.  </s>
