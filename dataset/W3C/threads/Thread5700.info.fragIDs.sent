I don't know what its permissions should be. 
What is it? 
Is it linked from something else?

Well, I don't know what the permissions are, but I can't access it, and I think I should be able to access all the test directories.

I've fixed the 03owlt permissions. 
Let me know if I missed something.

Looks better, but there is no way of checking the permissions except trying to read the file/directory, so I don't know if there are other, similar problems.
