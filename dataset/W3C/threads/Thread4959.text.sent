I'm trying to understand if it is possible to use xsl:sequence to return nodes, specifically elements, from the source document. 
Without getting into the use case behind this, I read both the latest public working draft and the current working draft as saying that in the following: and $foo will be assigned equivalent nodes from the source document (in particular, if the result is some descendant of the root, then I can apply parent or ancestor axes and get the same results). 
If that's the case, is it further the case (here's the real interesting part) that I can put the xsl:sequence in a template, i.e., and, once again, get back an equivalent node?

Yes, it is possible. 
Without getting into the use case behind this, I read both the latest public working draft and the current working draft as saying that in the following: and $foo will be assigned equivalent nodes from the source document (in particular, if the result is some descendant of the root, then I can apply parent or ancestor axes and get the same results). 
No: the latter case constructs a temporary tree. 
To return a value from the source document, you need an "as" attribute, thus: If that's the case, is it further the case (here's the real interesting part) that I can put the xsl:sequence in a template, i.e., and, once again, get back an equivalent node? 
Yes, you can do this. 
Again, you need the "as" attribute on xsl:variable.

I am please as punch that this is possible. 
The logic behind using "as", though, is completely opaque to me.
