I am trying to test my pages on as many browsers as possible. 
Since it now 
appears that more than half of all surfers on-line are connecting through 
AOL (sigh), I need to be able to test my pages in AOL's browser. 
I went to aol.com and downloaded the latest browser, but there doesn't seem to be any way to use it without signing up for AOL. 
Also, there doesn't seem to be a developer's site, or, in fact, any information at all to make my life 
easier. 
Interestingly, I tested the browser on local files and it seems to be using MSIE to do it's Internet browsing. 
Could it be that making pages work in IE will cover AOL also? 
Seems to good to be true. 
Besides, my parents have AOL and they are always reporting problems with my sites. 
I test with everything from Lynx to Opera to pwWebspeak and Mosaic, and I can never duplicate the problems they report (then again, I'm on a PC and they're on a Mac, so anything's possible). 
Would really like my pages to be accessible to everyone. 
Anyone know how to test in AOL without signing up? 
Also, are there any other browsers I can pick up (freely or very cheaply, please... 
I'm not rich) that others recommend? 
I am particularly interested in screen readers, but they all seem quite expensive. 
Also, anything I download must work on Win95 (so emacspeak 
is out). 
Kynn, you seem to be an expert on browsers. 
What say you? 
Thanks. 
I currently have the following: MSIE 5.0 beta2 Netscape 4.5, 4.07, 4.05, 3.4, 3.1, 2.02 
Mosaic 3.0 Lynx 2.8 pwWebspeak 2.0 Opera 3.5 WebTV viewer AOL 4.0??? 
Also, any ideas for how to get around Bill Gates' dictum that thou shalt only have one copy of IE on your system? 
Short of a dual boot, that is.

Charles, I was running into the same problems. 
It became a major concern when I discovered that a client I designed a site for was using AOL as their primary browser and I hadn't tested under AOL. 
What I found worked well for simulating the same appearance as the AOL Browser was Browserola using the HTML 3.0 test feature. 
I am also now including an AOL detection script on my sites and giving those users a page which explains how to use the Standard versions of either IE or Netscape instead of the proprietary one built into AOL. 
Other than that I also have not found anything that simulates the AOL default browser, though CODA, the maker of Browserola, claims that their next version will add this feature.

Yay! I have about a half dozen I use, not counting various versions of the same thing. 
The problem here is that at various times, AOL uses different software. 
I believe now they _do_ use IE (or a co-branded IE) as their web browser software. 
However, they didn't always, and so if someone joined AOL years ago and hasn't taken the time to download a new browser from AOL, they may be stuck with the AOL home-grown browser. 
Which is generally pretty crappy. 
:) 
Yikes, now I _have_ to look authoritative. 
:) 
This is pretty much what I have; an older version of Lynx would be good, and also, go hunting for some of the really freaky browser versions from third-string or fourth-string companies. 
Stuff like Amaya (okay, maybe the W3C shouldn't fairly be called "third string"), or Arache (for DOS). 
If you have an HP printer, get the HP web page formatter program, that functions as a browser to download and pretty-print web pages. 
Oh, also download the test for Gecko from http://developer.netscape.com/ 
BrowserWatch has a list of Windows browsers (some links are dead): 
I've seen how to make IE4 and IE5 co-exist, but I can't really remember how. 
I just run IE4 on my laptop and Sun machine, and IE5 on the Win95 desktop machine, sorry. 
As for AOL, I'm assuming you know that Bobby has an option for various versions of AOL's homegrown browser; naturally, though, it's not as good as seeing the real thing. 
A somewhat amusing, but generally unhelpful, web page is at http://powered.cs.yale.edu:8000/~miller/aol/aol.html Slightly more helpful is http://home.daytaco.com/aolhelp/ 
which at least tells you what AOL's browser won't do. 
A user-oriented page is at I'm hunting around, but I can't seem to find the AOL browser separately anywhere as a downloadable executable; I think it's embedded into the core system of AOL. 
Sorry I couldn't be much more help.

My apologies if this is message had been sent twice. 
However, our organization has had severe email problems for the last two days and am not sure if this was sent. 
Kynn, saw you mentioned pwWebSpeak 2.0. 
Just an FYI for others, they just 
sent version 2.5 to users. 
Also you mentioned WebTV viewer. 
Is this a viewer for the PC? 
Or are you talking about the actual WebTV?

The WebTV people have made an "emulator" for WebTV, that can be run on Mac or PC platforms. 
It shows you how your page should look on WebTV, gives somewhat bobby-esque comments in another panel about the HTML it does and doesn't understand (hint: it's not 3.2 or 4.0 compliant), and also has a cute feature where you can make an on-screen remote and use that to navigate. 
You can download it from http://developer.webtv.net/ 
which also has notes on designing "for" webtv (a silly notion unless you're going to make one page per client program/version -- of course, I think someone on this list is doing that *grin*).
