I presented at the Internet f?r Alle conference on the digital divide in Berlin Yesterday. 
This presentation was originally to be made by Judy, but owing to disruption to travel I was the person able to arrive. 
It was a short presentation on the guidelines work at W3C, and implementing them. 
The audience was several hundred, and the major feedback (both from representatives of organisations, and from representatives of the German Interior Ministry, who co-sponsored the conference) was a desire for an "authorised" translation of W3C specifications. 
I will be speaking at the XML Europe days in Oslo and Stockholm next week, and my topic will be Semantic Web and Accessibility.

'Clerk with cognitive disability at an online grocery service' Could someone please advise me who wrote this scenario, and what evidence there is to support it.? I find this highly offensive. 
It may have great intentions, however the majority of people with learning difficulties are unemployed. 
Those in the UK are trapped in a situation where it is practically impossible for them to earn more than ?15/week. 
thanks jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web" 
Jonathan The draft scenario about the clerk was written as a combined effort, drawn from experience of several members of the EOWG with people that they knew, and experience with Web based shopping systems. 
The employment situation of people with developmental disabilities varies across different countries. 
Not all of the scenarios are valid for each person with a disability in any given country, nor are they intended to be. 
However the scenario has problems for technical reasons, which we discovered after further inquiries into Web based shopping systems. 
Those technical problems have been discussed in EOWG meetings, and as a result the EOWG agreed to either substantially change, or to replace that scenario, the next time we revise this draft.

I'd be happier if the scenario was removed asap. 
I do recognise there are good reasons for things remaining stable. 
However I advised against this scenario at the time, and frankly find it offensive to be associated, even remotely with it. 
It appears to have been included as a token gesture, at the time. 
If those members who promoted it are not willing to be identified it says little for their credibility. 
Perhaps in future we could have a more open system where proposals are from named individuals, who are responsible to the group for their proposal. 
Clearly we need to discuss possible scenarios, and although I submitted one quite some time ago, I've yet to receive any response. 
My suggestion related to accessing multimedia, music, films An example where symbolic links are used without any text by a large commercial organisation is: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/ 
It is intended for a mainstream audience, yet remains accessible to LDD users. 
Unfortunately as no text alternative is provided, and many of the links cannot be tabbed to, we probably shan't be able to use it. 
thanks ps could you please refrain from copying me into eowg mail, I have received up to 8 copies of an email from you.

Jonathan: You don't appear to be associated with this scenario; you are not listed in the contributors nor in the EOWG Members in good standing so I am unclear regarding your urgent concern that you would be associated with this scenario in this draft. 
The history of who has proposed what is publicly available on the EOWG mailing list and in minutes of meetings and change logs which reflect group discussion. 
You are as welcome as anyone else to look at who contributed to EOWG work, so kindly do not offend EOWG Members by implying otherwise. 
Some proposals received since our last draft have already been discussed and will be incorporated in our next draft. 
If there are others that have been received but not yet discussed, we will discuss them, and if appropriate incorporate them before moving the document out for public review. 
I don't know why your email client is receiving multiple copies. 
You should receive no more than two from me with this message, which is the same number that I receive when you send messages addressed to me and the list.

Judy, you are being somewhat disingenuous. 
you sent me copies of an email to ig and gl twice that makes 8 copies, which is somewhat ridiculous. 
I was listed as an active member at the time the scenario was being discussed. 
I asked at that time who was contributing the scenario, and received no response. 
Certainly no initial email for discussion containing the scenario was read by me. 
You chose not to list me as a contributor, though I had submitted an alternative scenario. 
This has been a major factor in why I no longer listed as an active member of eowg. 
If you would like contributions from me on eowg perhaps you will consider raising this issue once again. 
If you are not willing to address this issue there is little point in me remaining on the eowg mailing list.
