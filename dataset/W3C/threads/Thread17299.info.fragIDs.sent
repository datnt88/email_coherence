Hi, I am looking into the problems of making road maps on the net more accessible. 
Most solutions rely heavily on JavaScript, and that is probably necessary since speed is a big issue. 
I am more interested in how to make navigating the road maps more accessible for keyboard users. 
It is pretty easy to make functions like ZOOM and panning the map accessible and they sometimes are, but I have not yet seen a road map where all the basic functionality were optimized for keyboard users. 
It would help me a lot if some of you could point me to good examples of accessible navigation to road maps, or just point me to the better Map Services, from an accessible point of view. 
Cheers, Jesper Tverskov 
Where is the guideline that requires supporting ALL possible configurations. 
Do you also make the argument that all new MAC software must work on an Apple II? 
And let's not limit this to the MAC platform. 
Perhaps all new PC software should be required to work on a Commadore 64 or PC running an 8086 chip as well as it does on a PC using a P4 chip or the manufacturer should be hauled into court. 
Wonder if this would have any impact on software development. 
Kurt Mattes Application Development Analyst - Lead Developer Kurt_Mattes@BankOne.com Behalf Of Access Systems I feel like I have repeated this at least a gazillion times but 
- or - fix the one or two browsers that don't fully support the HTML 4.01 spec? 
For example, would it be more cost efficient for government to fund the improvement of Lynx than to mandate all the web applications to revert to HTML 2 days? 
I am also surprised at some of the "right's" arguments. 
Individuals I talk to who have disabilities prefer to have access to what everyone else 
how many people with disabilities have you talked to in the third world?? 
has access to, including web application using scripting. 
Most individual's who have disabilities do not want to be ghettoized to use some other less capable web application. 
Individuals who have disabilities NEED the faster client side scripting just like everyone else. 
They want to come in the front door just like everyone else. 
We are dealing with a WORLD WIDE WEB. and I emphisize the WORLD WIDE part. 
in many parts of the world people especially people with disabilities have very limited bandwidth and service and cannot afford to deal with the HUGE resources required to use the more "modern" browsers. 
in at least one contact (an independent living center) I have in Nicaragua they are still linked to the web with a Apple II, and an acoustic coupler. 
can you even support scripting at 1200 baud??? (offered em a newer modem but the telephone lines wouldn't handle it) THESE people need access to the web maybe even more than we do. 
and we must continue to support thier access.

but their computers will run the current HTML with CSS. and again it is a WORLD WIDE WEB, not a PRIVILEDGED FEW WEB Bob CONFIGURE YOUR E-MAIL TO SEND TEXT ONLY, see http://expita.com/nomime.html

Let's not get silly here. 
Since well on the beginning of commercial web development, the concept of graceful degradation has been a pivotal development guideline. 
One of the best arguments for using CSS is that by stripping display from content even older browsers like NN2 can access the content. 
This was never scoffed at or dismissed, but rather accepted as an additional benefit for developers to make the move from font to CSS. 
Why not think of this when talking about client side scripting? 
What happens if scripting is not there or supported? 
Where (or what) is the graceful degradation? 
Can the same functionality be delivered via a server side script? 
If so, how? 
While it has taken some time to get commercial web developers to abandon crud like font in favor of CSS, the reality is it is happening. 
So why not use the same line of thought and attack for client side scripting? 
The arguments against 100% reliance of client side scripting for Mission Critical functionality are well documented in numerous places. 
However continued education is required to bring the thousands (millions?) of web developers out there to understand, accept, and find alternative solutions. 
We, the active members of this list, need to lead the way.

We are not talking about programs here, we are talking documents. 
I think this is the crux of the scripting problem. 
A WEBPAGE IS A DOCUMENT NOT A PROGRAM. 
If you want networking applications, write a program. 
If you want to convey information, use the web.

sadly though there are many web apps today. 
The difference between the functional needs of the web though whether it be as app or document is that it is as bob says, World Wide.
