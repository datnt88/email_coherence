Hello all, Naturally, UWI.Com is in agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Vincent since these views were the ones that guided the creation of UFDL, the non-XML predecessor of XFDL that existed before there was an XML. 
Joseph, do you think it is possible to include Mr. Vincent's position paper on the signed XML web site? 
It should be noted that Mr. Vincent's position has substantial backing within the legal community. 
As far as I know, Cohasset is the leading legal authority on the admissibility of documents into a court of law. 
You can read a paper they've put together on this issue using pure as possible, be forewarned that we like this article because it has a nice blurb at the end which talks about XFDL being an enabling technology for legal filings, most of the paper is not really about UWI.Com so much as it is about the types of issues that Mr. Vincent raises and that should be addressed by a signed XML standard.

It is important to note that while I stand by my comments, I do not support any particular technology. 
Further, I suspect that there are technical considerations with which I must become more familiar that will alter or modify the legal position I espoused. 
The point of a potential W3C XML-Digital Signature working group, in my view, is not to adopt one particular technology or specification but to synthesize the best ideas from many technologies and/or specifications in order to produce a non-proprietary standard. 
To date, I have read and studied Himes' XCI, Brown's XMLDSIG, and Davidson's Digital Receipt (in this order). 
I like a lot of what I see in the Brown draft, but I am not yet ready to adopt any draft -- again, this is the point of a potential workgroup. 
I am also unclear about the implications and considerations of other XML-related technologies, such as XSL, DOM, and others. 
That is, what technologies are likely be become standards, what technologies will be supported in browsers, how do these technologies impact the usefulness of any particular XML methodology? 
I have not had time to thoroughly read the XFDL spec; I have only skimmed it. 
Noting that I have not detailed the draft (i.e, correct me if I am mischaracterizing XFDL . . 
.), while I think, as a legal matter, that style sheets should be signed and delivered with content, I like and support the idea of separating, logically and/or physically, structural and semantic/data elements and formatting (stylesheets), which XFDL does not appear to do (??), and I absolutely do _not_ support pages in electronic documents, which XFDL appears to do (??). 
In sum, I think it is premature to tout one draft over another. 
I look forward to meeting all of you in Boston and to working with you on these important issues in the future.

Hi Todd, The point of a potential W3C XML-Digital Signature working group, in my view, is not to adopt one particular technology or specification but to synthesize the best ideas from many technologies and/or specifications in order to produce a non-proprietary standard. 
To date, I have read and studied Himes' XCI, Brown's XMLDSIG, and Davidson's Digital Receipt (in this order). 
I like a lot of what I see in the Brown draft, but I am not yet ready to adopt any draft -- again, this is the point of a potential workgroup. 
I agree. 
My own paper talks about how to take the XFDL ideas and use them to create a better signed XML spec. 
Though not all XML apps do things the same way as XFDL, the underlying ideas we had to come up with are still applicable. 
Most of those ideas surround precisely the types of legal opinions you expressed. 
I have not had time to thoroughly read the XFDL spec; I have only skimmed it. 
Noting that I have not detailed the draft (i.e, correct me if I am mischaracterizing XFDL . . 
.), while I think, as a legal matter, that style sheets should be signed and delivered with content, I like and support the idea of separating, logically and/or physically, structural and semantic/data elements and formatting (stylesheets), which XFDL does not appear to do (??), and I absolutely do _not_ support pages in electronic documents, which XFDL appears to do (??). 
Whether or not you agree with having them put together does not change whether or not you agree with the fact that they have to be signed together. 
As I pointed out in my paper, it seems acceptable to me to add the data layer and the stylesheet together to obtain a message to be signed. 
As for whether you agree with pages, the fact that XFDL can support multiple pages doesn't mean that you have to recommend that multiple pages be available in applications. 
However, XFDL forms are meant to be like paper, and I don't think the legal community has a problem with multipage paper forms being signed on the last page. 
Further, over half our our deployments require multipage forms because organizations simply won't tolerate having e-forms that aren't like their paper forms-- not without a whole pack of attorneys telling them it's OK to change everything! 
For what it's worth, XFDL signs the presentation logic statements, so logic that changes the page when the user isn't looking also gets signed, and a malicious e-form could thereby be discovered. 
As for whether XFDL can support separation of data and presentation, it is actually a common misconception that XFDL cannot support separation of data and presentation. 
The problem is that we've had to work so hard to convince people that data and presentation need to be together, esp. 
for signing, that this is often what is heard most often, so our marketing efforts are partly to blame! 
However, 1 unit of creativity outweighs 100 units of belief. 
Because XFDL has a computation system built in, it can do virtually anything (I've even done parallel processing simulations in XFDL forms). 
Ironically, the method also uses the very idea you don't like: multiple pages. 
A form can use a page to carry the data layer, then use multiple other pages to show various views to different people. 
The selection of view can even be made at run-time. 
Computes are used to carry the data to all views, and only the page (or pages) with the right view (or views) is actually shown to the user. 
During signing, signature filters are used to incorporate the data layer into whatever page is actually being signed, so we still can bind the data and presentation into one signature. 
We can even bind all style sheets to a single signature if desired so that all valid views are frozen. 
Basically, it should be easy to do easy things, and the most often used features should be the defaults, and this is why XFDL puts data and presentation together-- for e-commerce, that's what people need to do most of the time anyway. 
In sum, I think it is premature to tout one draft over another. 
I look forward to meeting all of you in Boston and to working with you on these important issues in the future. 
At this workshop, I'm hoping that positions like ours and yours will help get the signed XML group to include features like wrapping in stylesheets and unparsed entities as well as offering signature filters-.
