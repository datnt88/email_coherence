Hi, I am doing a new release of the Silfide XML Parser (SXP) with support for the new DOM recommandation version. 
I am getting into troubles with the methods insertBefore, appendChild, ... within a Document. 
If i append a node of type DOCUMENT_TYPE in a Document, this node have to be at least after the XMLDecl and before the ElementRoot. 
Do 
i have to force the place/index of this Node if i say Document.insertBefore(DTDNode, XMLDECLNode) or throws a DOMException ?

I don't see anything in the DOM spec that says it enforces the order of the children of Document. 
If you have a requirement for that ordering, I think your application has to deal with it, or you'll need to subclass the DOM to add that behavior.

Pat, 
Do 
This is another grey area in the DOM spec. 
Some implementations will force you to insert at appropriate position and some will not care. 
You should protect yourself by inserting DocumentType into appropriate location. 
Note that there is also nothing about XMLDecl node.
