<s> Hi, I am doing a new release of the Silfide XML Parser (SXP) with support for the new DOM recommandation version.  </s>
<s> I am getting into troubles with the methods insertBefore, appendChild, ... within a Document.  </s>
<s> If i append a node of type DOCUMENT_TYPE in a Document, this node have to be at least after the XMLDecl and before the ElementRoot.  </s>
<s> Do  </s>
<s> i have to force the place/index of this Node if i say Document.insertBefore(DTDNode, XMLDECLNode) or throws a DOMException ?  </s>

<s> I don't see anything in the DOM spec that says it enforces the order of the children of Document.  </s>
<s> If you have a requirement for that ordering, I think your application has to deal with it, or you'll need to subclass the DOM to add that behavior.  </s>

<s> Pat,  </s>
<s> Do  </s>
<s> This is another grey area in the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> Some implementations will force you to insert at appropriate position and some will not care.  </s>
<s> You should protect yourself by inserting DocumentType into appropriate location.  </s>
<s> Note that there is also nothing about XMLDecl node.  </s>
<s> Best, Don Park Docuverse  </s>
