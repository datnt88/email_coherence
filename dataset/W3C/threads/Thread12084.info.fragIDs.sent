<s> unquote i am loathe to let my (and others') cynical opinion of human nature lead me to the ironclad conclusion that the "default" reaction to minimal requirements will be to use them as a lazyman's loophole... so, while i agree that there is a very real danger inherent in the concept of explicitly stating a minimal satisfactory implementation of a checkpoint, that isn't what is under discussion... what the "at a minimum" clauses are intended to provide is a description of the absolute base functionality required by the checkpoint, and realpolitik dictates that the dangers of not explictly outlining base functionality for a checkpoint far outweigh the dangers of either providing a loophole for lazy developers by forcing them, at the very least, to provide well-defined functionality... minimal requirements don't dictate the implementation details of the required functionality -- they merely define what base functionality MUST be available to the user... moreover, when WAI guidelines (such as the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) do not contain explicit requirements for minimally satisfying a checkpoint, the working groups have received requests from developers, claiming that the affiliated Techniques documents, due to their informative/non-normative status, cannot sufficiently address what is minimally required to satisfy a particular checkpoint... so, while i share your concern about the potential straitjacketing effect normative minimal requirements may have upon developers, there is also a clear need to define normatively what exactly constitutes minimal satisfaction of the checkpoint in question, as well as the need for providing context for the checkpoint... for example, what use would it be to simply state that a user agent MUST offer a search facility, if the basic parameters for a search facility aren't explicitly stated? the ability to search is the absolute minimum, but the ability to search is quite an amorphous concept, so the base functionality necessary for a UAAG conformance claim is spelled out explictly in the User Agent Guidelines [reference 1] as for your last point, quote Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution?  </s>
<s> unquote, while the answer is, "yes", the reply is not as onerous as one might assume... i know from my experience as a member of the User Agent working group that what the UA WG intends by expressing minimal requirements for checkpoints is to express the functionality necessary to minimally satisfy the checkpoint, and NOT the mechanism whereby the functionality is achieved -- that, as you correctly point out, is fodder for the Techniques document... granted, in order to express the minimal functionality required by a checkpoint, it may be necessary to more explicitly reference specific markup languages, but where the User Agent WG found it necessary to explicitly state base functionality with reference to a specific markup language or modality, the minimal requirements are expressions of the minimal functionality required by the checkpoint, and not the "preferred", "ultimate", or "one-and-only" means of achieving that functionality... i'm curious as to whether resistance to the idea of minimal requirements has been discussed with the product groups responsible for IE, as the MS reps who have played an integral part in developing and shaping UAAG did not object to the insertion of minimal requirements into UAAG, and several of the minimum requirements that appear in the Last Call Cubed draft of UAAG were derived directly from comments and requests for clarification from Microsoft reps/commentors... is the resistance to minimal requirements a reflection of the broad net cast by ATAG, which--in the case of Microsoft--would cover such diverse products as FrontPage, Word, and Publisher, at least as regards their "Save to HTML/Web" functionalities?  </s>

<s> Another point is that there's the "in the meanwhile" problem - until such a benevolent company actually could show that there is some undercover content production that is successful in: producing accessible content; doing so without revealing how/what the process is, there is still a need to check and see if that particular fox is really guarding those particular hens, if you take my meaning.  </s>
