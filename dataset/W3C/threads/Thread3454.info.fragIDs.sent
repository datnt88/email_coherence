<s> I was envisioning something similar for W3C standards stuff.  </s>

<s> Ok. Thanks for the mail, the comments and the trackbacks.  </s>
<s> I've incorporated comments and suggestions and updated the post.  </s>
<s> I think I've done justice to everyone's input; if not, let me know.  </s>

<s> I didn't mean to get in your way, Don.  </s>
<s> Apologies.  </s>
<s> I wonder if this great aggregator idea doesn't need a bit more lead-time and planning?  </s>
<s> For example, what I've posted is really not as "pure" on the subject of standards as it could be; there is a mix of the personal, the mundane, sometimes the bizarre and also the standards related.  </s>
<s> If there were an aggregator, you'd like to have only the standards and/or accessibility topics getting pinged through.  </s>

<s> W3C *is* the logical place to put the aggregator and if someone can push some buttons to get that working, that makes a lot of sense.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, there might be other venues.  </s>
<s> For example, the Internet Topic Exchange (http://topicexchange.com/) is already up and running and seems to be a self-administered utility.  </s>
<s> This might be worth a look.  </s>
<s> It might happen more quickly and it might get more spread given it's a link exchange venue that attracts diffuse interests.  </s>

<s> Hi Ed, This is great.  </s>
<s> Let me compare your list to one I have in html and see if there are a few you did not list.  </s>
<s> Looks like most of the standards, guidelines, and accessibility blogs are present, though I think I missed seeing a few.  </s>
<s> Will get back to you tomorrow on this, and if I forget, email me a nice note.  </s>
<s> I need to make a collection of these for another purpose or two.  </s>
<s> So we are going to be able to attack two situations with one task.  </s>
<s> [smile] Thanks, holly  </s>
<s> The list is really good still looking for Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, German, etc... Standards related blogs.  </s>
<s> :) Do you know some?  </s>

<s> If they are.  </s>
<s> Then I will pop it up on one of my sites and offer the link, later today.  </s>
<s> I am also very interested in others that Karl mentioned... holly  </s>
<s> I don't unfortunately.  </s>
<s> Language-wise, I can stumble with Spanish and probably Italian at about the same level I do with French.  </s>
<s> However, I'm happy to set up and accept requests from all the linguistic groups assuming I can figure out the encoding issues if there are any.  </s>

<s> It's not a blog but a daily journal fronting a soon to be converted but non-standards based site - and concerns web standards, accessibility and field trips in Cornwall which we run every year (and this year's our eighth annual bash) If you think it worth it, include it.  </s>
