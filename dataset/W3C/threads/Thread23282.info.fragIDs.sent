<s> Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> The more we work through different possible choices, the stronger we tend to feel about what we have.  </s>
<s> All implementations thus far have an easy way of grabbing just a single result without caring about complete computation of the result.  </s>
<s> This is an extremely practical consideration both for ease of use and for efficiency of use and implementation.  </s>
<s> When the caller needs just one, he shouldn't have to set up the whole mechanism required for dealing with multiples.  </s>
<s> Ultimately, XPath and DOM are for the use of the user.  </s>
<s> It is common to need just one node, which is what the API makes easily available, but only if that is what was requested.  </s>
<s> The names and descriptions of the single-node type make it clear, I believe, that although the XPath result may easily contain more, the  </s>
<s> user gets what he requested (although if you can suggest how to make it  </s>
<s> clearer, please do so).  </s>
<s> If you ask for one, you get one back, which is any unordered node of the result or the first ordered node of the result.  </s>
<s> If ask to iterate over the result on the live tree , that is what you get.  </s>
<s> If you want a snapshot that does not invalidate, that is what you get.  </s>
<s> Users seem to understand the concept of an iterator that invalidates when the thing it is iterating over changes, as well as a "snapshot".  </s>
<s> I think the confusion has been less since the terminology  </s>
<s> has changed to be more relevant.  </s>
<s> There are significant issues of liveness and consistency that DOM implementers and users cannot simply ignore, however much they may be ignored in XSL and other XPath situations.  </s>
<s> Returning a NodeList would give people the wrong guarantee about liveness because of the clear guarantee of DOM with respect to liveness of NodeLists.  </s>
<s> Calling it a "Set" clarifies nothing about how it is different from a NodeList, but just gives users another interface to confuse.  </s>
<s> The live behavior of a NodeList is quite appropriate for a child list, but much less so for the result of an XPath query.  </s>
<s> XPath followed quite different assumptions from the existing DOM model, and in more ways than just liveness.  </s>
<s> I think the interface is a reasonable API for making the results of XPath 1.0 expressions available in DOM.  </s>
<s> It supports by request multiple views of the XPath result, as is useful to DOM users, and directly on the returned object, which seems to make it simpler for users than juggling multiple result objects and getting one from the other.  </s>
<s> A set is not inherently a list, but if you wish to access it as a list, then use the snapshot because lists of things computed like XPath results have difficulty being live.  </s>
<s> I think if you think the static list is your preferred form, then ignore everything but the snapshot, and write all your examples and use cases accordingly.  </s>
<s> But DOM needs to satisfy other use cases.  </s>
<s> As much as DOM has been ignored by XPath purists, I think percieved purity in the DOM implementation of XPath (which I don't agree that your suggestions accomplish) would not win out over the ability to practically use the interface to get the desired results.  </s>
<s> We would have returned variant object types for better conceptual separation instead of a single result, but that is not easily supported in all target environments, and there is no difference in how the user uses it.  </s>
<s> The one object is effectively multiple object types simultaneously.  </s>
<s> It does not seem to help the user to force him to juggle more distinct objects for every query.  </s>
<s> I do not believe any implementor is willing to implement a live XPath implementation, as your use of NodeList requires.  </s>
<s> XPath does not mention NodeList, whereas it is a clear concept in DOM, and one that does not apply in this case.  </s>
<s> The current API is a very practical bridge, I think between XPath results and DOM access to them, and it is not like we have not seriously entertained each alternative you mention.  </s>
<s> Is there anything that the current API does not do that you need it to?  </s>
<s> Ray Whitmer rayw@netscape.com  </s>
<s> That's not quite true, at least not as I read the API.  </s>
<s> The user may write an XPath expression which returns a node set containing 10 nodes.  </s>
<s> However, the current API presents this just the same as an XPath that returns a node set containing one node.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind a selectSingleNode() function provided it threw an exception if the XPath produced anything more or less than one node.  </s>
<s> The API should be as simple and easy-to-use as possible, but no simpler.  </s>
<s> There's been a real tendency in XML APIs to hide the complexity of XML by pretending it's simpler than it really is.  </s>
<s> This isn't a good thing.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, this is a sin which DOM hasn't committed to date.  </s>
<s> (In fact, I suspect the opposite is true if anything.) The fact is XPath 1.0 expressions do not return single nodes.  </s>
<s> They return node sets.  </s>
<s> I see lots of developers making logic errors because they think an XPath expression returns a single node.  </s>
<s> It might be easier for them if an XPath expression did return a single node, but this isn't what actually happens and it isn't something that can be fixed in DOM.  </s>
<s> It would have to be fixed in XPath.  </s>
<s> DOM should not sweep the issue under the rug.  </s>
<s> It should allow developers to ignore the very real possibility that an expression returns several nodes.  </s>
<s> In the long run, I suspect we'd all be better off if DOM XPath hewed more closely to what XPath actually is, rather than  </s>
<s> what developers want it to be.  </s>

<s> If a single result is requested, returning a null node seems completely adequate when there are no results found.  </s>
<s> I disagree that it would be worth the extra computation just to be able to throw an exception when more than one node is discovered.  </s>
<s> If a user wants to know that there was exactly one result, it is easy enough to request the snapshot or iterator that permits him to check that.  </s>
<s> In DOM, exceptions should represent programming errors, not excessive search results, although there are flaws in certain cases in the existing API.  </s>
<s> I said that such extra mechanism is not set up if the user does not request it.  </s>
<s> You said that is not true, but insisted on usual full computation of the expression over the entire document looking for the elusive second node the user either already knows is not there or does not care to know about.  </s>
<s> The current API gives the user the part he requested, be that a single node or a complete set.  </s>
<s> There is no real victory in insisting on computing the entire thing just so the user can ignore everything but the first entry of the set.  </s>
<s> That would make the single node feature worth less, I think, to both the implementor and the user, if it were just a wrapper that generally forced the entire document to be combed looking for another match and creating artificial failure when there is not exactly one match, which the user may already know or not need to know, and can easily request if he needs it.  </s>
<s> As I have said before, the user who wants that, can get it using the iterator or snapshot which compute the entire result, but he should know that he will pay for the luxury of a complete result.  </s>
<s> XPath's over-simplified world does not exist for DOM applications.  </s>
<s> XPath also does not deal with mutable nodes, but I think we should be realists and not restrict it to read-only fully-normalized tree with no entity references, etc.. DOM is for developers to apply XML, not just for theorists.  </s>
<s> The API presents the results of an expression -- as much of the result as is requested.  </s>
<s> Getting a single node, whatever the expression may return, has been counted as a significant use case, and one that existing XPath implementations available through DOM APIs in Mozilla and IE support.  </s>
<s> If the current descriptions are not clear on that point that this option does not provide the entire result of an XPath expression, that can be fixed as an editorial change, but the intent of single-node in this API is for those who want a single node, knowing for certain based upon validation or construction techniques that there is one, or not caring to process beyond a single one.  </s>
<s> Computer application development languages seldom resemble pure set theory -- IMO Lisp does not although certain purists think so, but if we used a lisp model, DOM would be very different and probably not in browsers.  </s>
<s> Sets and numbers would never be mutable, but variables and documents are and it goes much further.  </s>
<s> I do not think we are going too far giving directly giving developers (and naming it well) what some use cases call for, just because the XPath model does not address such issues.  </s>
<s> Allowing easy access to a single result is purely a practical consideration.  </s>
<s> Restricting results to only completely-computed result sets so that the user can ignore all but the first does not seem like a real win for anyone.  </s>
<s> The user could likewise select a single element of the result in the XPath expression if that is what his application calls for.  </s>
<s> The API just makes it more convenient and economical to use XPath for this common use case, which shouldn't be a crime, since the developer decides which he wants when he formulates the call, just as surely as if he hard-coded "resultSet[1]" into his application.  </s>
<s> You cannot force the user to consider more than one result significant when it is not, whatever the entire result set may contain.  </s>
<s> That is why the feature clearly states "FIRST_ORDERED_NODE" or "ANY_UNORDERED_NODE" which to me clearly says just by looking at the name that a partial result is being requested, and there is a description as well.  </s>
<s> It is not called "ONLY_NODE".  </s>
