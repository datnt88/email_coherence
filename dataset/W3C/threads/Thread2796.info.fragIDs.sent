<s> Hi, what is the current de factor standard version of HTTP used by most internet web servers ?  </s>
<s> I originally thought it's 1.1 but the recent IETF spec mail on 1.1 makes me wonder.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it's 1.0 ?  </s>
<s> What about HTTP-NG ?  </s>
<s> thanks, wendy  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 is declared dead HTTP/1.1 is de facto  </s>
<s> HTTP-NG isn't yet  </s>
<s> Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> I have seen data that makes me believe over half the servers on the public internet now claim to speak HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> Client and proxy support is currently considerably less than this.  </s>
<s> HTTP/NG is just at the formative stages, far from any deployment, if ever.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Surveys say Apache runs more than 50% of the web.  </s>
<s> Apache uses HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> Apache does not use HTTP-NG.  </s>
<s> Does that help?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ben.  </s>

<s> You might be interested to learn that we're using a modified version of Apache in our HTTP-NG testbed.  </s>
<s> But we haven't yet got as good an integration as we'd like, and there are not yet any browsers that speak HTTP-NG, so this is just FYI, not anything we can recommend to users right now.  </s>
<s> From what little I know of HTTP-NG, you may get better results with Apache 2.0 (which is multithreaded).  </s>
<s> OTOH, we need to sort out the I/O layer abstraction first.  </s>
<s> Input welcome.  </s>
