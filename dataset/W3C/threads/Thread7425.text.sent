The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring -- WEBDAV' draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-10.txt as a Proposed Standard. 
This document is the product of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group. 
Note: this document was originally Last Called with the title 'Extensions for Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide Web -- WEBDAV' which was changed at the request of the AD. 
The IESG contact persons are Keith Moore and Patrik Faltstrom. 
Technical Summary This document defines extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol (new methods, data types, request header fields, response header fields, and status codes) to allow for the creation and management of HTTP-accessible resources, properties of such resources, and named collections of such resources. 
The intent is to allow for such management via the HTTP protocol, as opposed to traditional means of management such as directly manipulating the underlying file store. 
Working Group Summary This document represents a great deal of careful compromise, and describes a subset of the originally intended features, but the working group has reached consensus on the result. 
Protocol Quality Keith Moore reviewed the spec for IESG. 
Wow... Wow.... Yaron -- WEBDAV to Proposed Standard Now *this* is something to be thankful for! 
I am incredibly grateful to the other members of the design team, Yaron, Steve, Del, and Asad, as well as to the very hard working members of this working group for all your work on this specification. 
This is a triumph for all of us!!
