Hi All try this one, http://www.abilitynet.co.uk/fullvis/index.htm 
Opinions please. 
This site has just won a 3 year sponsorship from British Telecom for their excellent work on promoting accessibility on the internet.

In the spirit of not trashing sites that seem to have made some effort I will not detail the problems I had with the first page/frameset. 
I do think this site is a pretty good example of how passing Bobby does not tell you much about the accessibility of a site. 
What exactly does "winning a sponsorship" mean? 
Does this mean the site will be considered a good example? 
Marti The home page of this site is not accessible. 
According to checkpoint 2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup [Priority 1], the phrase in the middle of the page "Note the menu option in RED on the left hand side of your screen. 
This button will take you to AbilityNet's Chat Room, Message Board, Guest-book and our NEW Mailing List service." 
This is a priority 1 and makes this site non-accessible. 
Actually, I don't believe it necessarily makes the site non-accessible (to whom? 
everyone?) but I do think that it makes the site confusing as it's harder to locate the menu option. 
It's okay to _use_ red as part of a design. 
The problem here is actually with the _phrase_. 
This particular phrase uses the two terms "RED" and "left hand side". 
If that phrase did not _exist_, would this specific accessibility problem exist? 
Assuming (which may not be the case) that the red button on the left hand side can be _identified_ in some way as the "menu option", then, no, this is _not_ a priority 1 violation. 
The information is available in more than simply color. 
It may be harder to find because of the _phrasing_, which is confusing, but "harder to find but not an absolute barrier to access" is a priority 2 violation, by definition. 
Confusing phrasing -- language which is dependent upon a specific presentation but which does not absolutely prevent someone from getting at the content -- is not covered by WCAG checkpoint 2.1. 
In fact, it's not covered by any WCAG checkpoint, to the best of my knowledge. 
If it were, it would be a P2 according to WCAG 1.0 priority definitions.
