The PROPFIND response on this server is broken. 
I send: PROPFIND / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: cadaver/0.5.0 Connection: Keep-Alive Host: webfolders.mydocsonline.com 
Content-Type: text/xml Depth: 0 Content-Length: 152 Authorization: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Response body is: Where the DAV:getlastmodified element is corrupt. 
Regards, joe The MyDocsOnline server is mod_dav (modified, I believe) under the covers. 
Looking at the code for getlastmodified, it would seem there is a problem with the C lib on the server. 
I'm doing the following: sprintf(buf, "%s, %.2d %s %d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d 
GMT", I can't see how it would generate the text you saw... very weird. 
I don't have a developer contact there, so let's hope they're listening here or will respond soon with the feedback@ address (so I can help them with the problem). 
Thanx for reporting this, Joe! Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/ 
The PROPFIND problem seems to have gone away... I've not heard back about any bugs being fixed, though. 
So, more testing: MKCOL gives 500 internal server error.
