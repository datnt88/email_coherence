Nir (I think) said: I think everybody will agree that tables are better than imagemaps... CMcCN:: No. I don't. 
Image maps can (and should) be provided with ALT text for each AREA, which makes it simple to deal with a text-only version. 
For people whose alternative is (flawed) screen readers TABLE may not be better. 
I do agree that use of images as links is not a really great practise - it often causes problems for fully sighted people (http://www.cfd.rmit.edu.au used to be my example, but I haven't looked for a while) who cannot understand how (for example) a light bulb is supposed to imply a gallery, or five horizontal bars an image. 
A preferable solution is to avoid TABLE as a layout mechanism completely, and to provide alternatives to imagemaps. 
Charles McCathieNevile I disagree, in fact, it is possiblt to include 'Alt' tags for each 'Area' tag. 
Not only the that, imagemaps were and are intended for low bandwidth. 
The bear fact of slicing up images into little pieces to fit in cells can't be less work than the map production itself This is just one example: !--webbot bot="ImageMap" polygon="(29,14) (100,16) (88,46) (31,36) src="images/layout3.jpg" width="319" height="215" alt=" Foobar" alt="layout3.jpg 
(3607 bytes)" border="0" -- Shurel When text is linked and separated by a space, we separate with a pipe or something to make it distinct. 
Say we have a bunch of images in side-by-side layout AND we are NOT using a table. 
Do we also include a separator with the alt tag. 
...Looking to see how on other browsers and tools handle this ( that I do not have) Building upon shurel's example, this would be something like this... alt="- layout3.jpg

Although it MAY be accessible, it only works with specific software/hardware cominations. 
However I agree in principle. 
The users who are disadvantaged by imagemaps are visual users with newish browsers (which don't give very good access to the various ALT text) and those using a screen-reader with such browsers, which I believe is even worse. 
Your example can be rewritten in proper HTML, and there is just such an example in the HTML 4.0 recommendation at P This is a navigation bar.
