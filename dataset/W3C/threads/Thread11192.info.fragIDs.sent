<s> I have just completed a preliminary distribution kit for my XML/CML browser JUMBO (Java Universal Markup Browser for Objects) and you are welcome to have a play.  </s>
<s> The points relevant to the WG are: - it is completely portable and installation-free (thanks to Java/Netscape).  </s>
<s> All you need is Netscape 3 or MSIE equivalent.  </s>
<s> You don't even need to know that Java exists, just how to click.  </s>
<s> - it makes use of 'links' in two examples.  </s>
<s> These are: (a) 1- many unidirectional link (the endpoint is a set of tokens in an Element (actually atoms in a molecule)) (b) a link that points to endpoints in two different elements (Obviously I am waiting with great enthusiasm to see the XML way of doing it properly and will start recoding as soon as some white smoke emerges).  </s>
<s> - it has a prototype of an element-based graphical editor (i.e. one element can be dragged to be a child or sibling of a non-ancestor.  </s>
<s> Or an element can be dragged to the trash.  </s>
<s> Similarly elements can be dragged to the clipboard and legacy files imported to the clipboard.  </s>
<s> There is a crude check on content validation, but I would hope to bolt NXP in to do the validation.  </s>
<s> - there are some examples of XML. - there are legacy files converted to XML-in-memory which can then be written out as XML.  </s>
<s> I would be very grateful for feedback and bug reporting.  </s>
<s> (I don't need to know that my skill as a GUI builder could be improved - I didn't intend to develop one :-) and it just happened.).  </s>
<s> The system takes about 30 seconds to install after download from: You then have to gunzip and untar - Winzip will do this for you.  </s>
<s> Then you have to click on index.html.  </s>
<s> (BTW you don't need to know any chemistry since I have also included scene1.sgm from Julius Caesar :-) (The linking demos are functgroup.html and vamp.html).  </s>
<s> [Note.  </s>
<s> I have run this on Netscape 3 on SUN, SGI, Mac, W95 and it works surprisingly well.  </s>
<s> (It was this lack of portaibility that meant I had to abandon costwish.) However there still are a number of problems on some platforms.  </s>
<s> The window handling is especially variable as are the speeds - you may be surprised which machine I rank bottom.  </s>
<s> So it may happen that you get crashes or poor performance - some of this may be due to client-side settings which are beyond me. the upside, I hope is that 5000 copies will be distributed shortly.]  </s>
<s> Installation experiences These XML files are WF (and *were* valid against cml.dtd and sgmls).  </s>
<s> I have not yet managed to validate them against NXP as there is a lot of editing to do.  </s>
<s> The CML distribution included: - CML.DTD which 'includes' TecML.DTD which 'includes' HTML20.DTD 'inclusion' is through parameter entities.  </s>
<s> - an SGML.DECL (at least that can be junked :-) - a Catalog using PUBLIC entities for: = the DTDs = various EntitySets (e.g. IsoLatin1).  </s>
<s> - about 10 files of attribute values and content models which are 'included' (this is so I can edit these files rather than the DTD.) Why do it this way?  </s>
<s> Because I need their contents for the postprocessor.  </s>
<s> I have only been converting for a few hours, and I'm still struggling with bits of the spec, using NXP as an arbiter.  </s>
<s> The things I have discovered are: - all the comments need changing.  </s>
<s> This cannot always be done automatically.  </s>
<s> - the conditional sections require no white space round the PEReference (trivial now that I know, but it took a while to spot it).  </s>
<s> - the tag model (the '- -' or '- O' - whatever it's called) needs excising.  </s>
<s> - the loss of PUBLIC is a total pain.  </s>
<s> When I set up the stuff about 12-18 months ago, I decided to use the catalog because it was the 'proper way', and I came to believe in this.  </s>
<s> (My own view about PUBLIC is very simple and naive - it tells you *what document to use* (not where to get it).  </s>
<s> I think this is important.) So all the references to Entity sets, etc are through PUBLIC.  </s>
<s> They all have to be changed.  </s>
<s> - the CATALOG needs changing (no ENTITY allowed, no '--') - the entity sets need changing (no '--', no SDATA).  </s>
<s> The main point is that I thought that XML was a subset of SGML and 5 minutes with vi would fix the files.  </s>
<s> Not so.  </s>
<s> I think people will not be very happy to have to have two version of files for entity sets.  </s>
<s> I suspect there will be a real need for tools that 'convert SGML to XML'.  </s>
<s> Because I need my DTD construction to be flexible, it's hairy and I would prefer to keep it in 'SGML', converting to XML when necessary or  </s>
<s> on the fly.  </s>
<s> Is there a tool which 'normalises' DTDs (i.e. resolves all the parameter entities) and outputs a 'processed' DTD? (While I'm on that, is there a tool which can parse the DTD so it can be used by a program?).  </s>
<s> A general conclusion is that you will need to give a good deal of help to people who want to convert from SGML.  </s>
<s> There are bits which aren't obvious and bits which you might expect to be there and aren't.  </s>
<s> This conversion is not just the document instances, it's the whole lot.  </s>
<s> (This isn't meant to sound negative... but it will be even harder for PhaseII).  </s>
<s> NB. I am not sure where the decision process is in Phase II, but I am right in assuming that it will contain most of Appendix A, and that the syntax will be essentially the same??  </s>
<s> I particularly don't want to lose anything in A.1.1.2.  </s>
<s> If so, I can start hacking some primitive internal search tool.  </s>
<s> It may be premature, but are *groves* almost certainly a part of XML-phaseII?  </s>
<s> (4.5) or is it simply allowed to build a query tool based on Appendix A? If not, someone is going to need to give me a tutorial as 10179 is not a Webhacker-friendly document.  </s>
