<s> I think that extending the required functionality statements could be problematic.  </s>
<s> Priority 2 and Priority 3 checkpoints are sometimes peripheral to the central issue that our relative priority checkpoint is trying to address, so adding these to the required functionality statements could greatly extend the length of the statements and dilute their usefulness.  </s>

<s> Carlos, could you look at the appendix to the techniques about prompting (when I get the document done - I am starting to realise just how big it is by breaking it into manageable chunks (well, sort of manageable anyway), and give us some idea how to align the terms we are using with those used in other work (such as the McFarlane reference you cite below)?  </s>
