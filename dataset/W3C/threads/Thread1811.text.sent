Hi, A very basic question. 
Should the hrefs that appear within the XML content be encoded? 
For example, should the hrefs reported in the DAV:successor-set be URL encoded? 
Should the '+' and the blank in the above URLs be encoded? 
Rgds, Girish There are no such things as "unencoded" URLs. 
A URL cannot contain a space.

There's no such thing as a un-encoded URI. 
If you un-encode it, it's not longer a URI.
