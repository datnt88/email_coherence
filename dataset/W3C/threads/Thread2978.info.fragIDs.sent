<s> Hi, Firstly I am not entirely sure this is the correct place to post but judging the kind of questions in this mailing list's archives it seems appropriate.  </s>
<s> I've developing some software that uses sockets to communicate with web servers using HTTP.  </s>
<s> I've seen both HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 used in GET headers.  </s>
<s> EG. "GET / HTTP/1.0" and "GET / HTTP/1.1".  </s>
<s> So far I've been using HTTP 1.0 in my GET headers but while browsing this list's archives I saw that HTTP 1.1 is in use (EG. the thread "HTTP 1.1, proxy servers, and failed connections") and wondered whether I should in fact be using 1.1 instead.  </s>
<s> Having run some tests it seems that some 'mainstream' web servers (EG.  </s>
<s> www.google.com)  </s>
<s> don't seem to respond to a HTTP 1.1 GETs.  </s>
<s> While others (EG.  </s>
<s> www.yahoo.com)  </s>
<s> do and act normally.  </s>
<s> Can someone explain to me whether I should be using HTTP 1.1 at all and, if so, under what circumstances?  </s>
<s> Apologies if this is off-topic, trivial or documented in a resource that I should have read before posting but obviously didn't find.  </s>
<s> Thanks and regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> It sounds like you've been sending a minimal HTTP/1.0 request to these servers, and tried simply changing the HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 in the initial request line.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.1 also requires requests to provide a Host header.  </s>
<s> Read the RFC for details, but I think you'll find that most servers accept properly-formatted HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.1 requests -- probably HTTP 0.9, also, but let's not go there.  </s>

<s> Use 2D123692  </s>
<s> Probably.  </s>
<s> Google does use HTTP/1.1 (though in checking that, I discovered that thier server does not support either OPTIONS or TRACE).  </s>
<s> If they are not responding as you expect, then you are probably not constructing the request correctly; there are differences.  </s>
<s> See RFC 2616: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt  </s>
<s> (most likely you are not including a 'Host' header - it was not required in 1.0, but is in 1.1).  </s>
<s> It has far better control of caching, and properly supports persistent connections; if either would be useful, then certainly.  </s>

<s> Many thanks Peter and Scott.  </s>
<s> You are absolutely correct, I was under the impression that you just needed to replace the HTTP/1.0 with 1.1 in my GET headers.  </s>
<s> Sorry if my question was trivial for the list.  </s>
<s> Thanks for not telling me to RTFM.  </s>
<s> Regards, ..matthew  </s>
