<s> When using CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyValue() method you are returned the value as it is declared as a string.  </s>
<s> This is a very powerful method (in conjunction with getComputedStyle) but I feel it needs expanded.  </s>
<s> Has the W3C been looking into a way of requesting the style in specified units for those styles that take units.  </s>
<s> I will give an example.  </s>
<s> Lets say the style for the height of an element is 1.3em, but I want it in pixels or points.  </s>
<s> I would like to see a method of retrieving the style in different units than those in the declaration.  </s>
<s> Any ideas and/or comments on this?  </s>
<s> Has this been discussed before?  </s>
<s> Any chance that this may be included in the recomendation in the future?  </s>

<s> Ian, Yes, but the problem with this is that you cannot get the relative value (say "em") to another relative unit (say "px").  </s>
<s> Most scripts deal with pixels.  </s>
<s> The spec is also not clear on if the unit is absolute can you convert it to relative using this method.  </s>
<s> I see that you cannot convert from one relative to another, but what about from an absolute to a relative?  </s>
<s> It all boils down to though that the need to be able to convert to pixels is great, no matter what unit is was declared with.  </s>
<s> Of course I am talking about ONLY computed styles, not style declarations.  </s>

<s> Shouldn't computed values on pixel devices always be in pixels anyway?  </s>

<s> I would think that all computed values should be in pixels, but that is left up to the implementation since it is stated that it must be done in pixels.  </s>
<s> I have not tested this in Mozilla as of yet since it is still buggy, but I can see where this can become an issue.  </s>
<s> Let us say that the style is defined in points, the most convenient method would be to just pass it along in points.  </s>
<s> It would not require the browser to interact with it's layout engine to calculate the value in pixels.  </s>
<s> As you can see, it depends upon how important speed is (both speed in coding as well as processing) to the development team.  </s>
