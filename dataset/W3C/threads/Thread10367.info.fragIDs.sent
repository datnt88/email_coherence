<s> With big thanks to Max Froumentin and other French W3C team members, we now have a fresh translation of the rdfs:label and rdfs:comment text for all RDF Core terms, ie. both schemas.  </s>
<s> Since MaxF is in Bristol  </s>
<s> it seemed a good chance to get this updated, so we've just had the odd experience of translating the likes of "the subject of the subject RDF statement."  </s>
<s> There were a fair few places where Max said it sounds a bit odd, but I believe those are mostly RDF's oddities rather than the translation.  </s>
<s> I think it is pretty faithful and literal, rather than attempting any major rephrasings.  </s>
<s> I've commited this into our shadow TR space,  </s>
<s> Deployment options: Ralph asked that we restore the French additions back into the document at the namespace URI.  </s>
<s> We could do this, but I fear it will create  </s>
<s> maintainance issues for us in the post-REC future.  </s>
<s> With the RDFS namespace doc, we always had an rdfs:seeAlso hypertext pointer to a 'more info' RDF file, I propose that we use that file, either directly or as a multi-lingual table of contents for this and other translations.  </s>
<s> A similar seeAlso pointer could be added to the M+S namespace.  </s>
<s> I propose they point to a single common 'French translation' document for now, rather than partitioning it into 2. I believe this will help establish  </s>
<s> the importance of hypertext linking in RDF documents (the 'Web' in 'Semantic Web') as well as provide a simple model for other translators to copy.  </s>
<s> I'm willing to be persuaded of other designs though; there doesn't seem to me to be an obviously 'right way' to deploy this.  </s>
<s> Ralph, do you have a strong preference for embedding the French translation rather than referencing it?  </s>
<s> There are also issues / opportunities w.r.t. use of language negotiation  </s>
<s> of such schemas, but that is too complicated and confusing for me to  </s>
<s> have any clear thoughts on right now.  </s>
<s> Suggestions welcomed...  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Thanks, Max and Dan!  </s>
<s> I see this has only one language declaration: and this surprises me.  </s>
<s> None of the strings in this document  </s>

<s> XML question -- does xml:lang apply to the values of any attributes, such as the dc:title in the case above?  </s>
<s> I dunno.  </s>
<s> But I am certain that there's no way an  </s>
<s> RDF processor or an XML processor will know the labels and comments are intended to be in French.)  </s>
<s> yes, this proposal makes sense to me.  </s>

<s> You're right, it should have gone on the rdf:RDF.  </s>
<s> BTW I believe we're bypassing the current I18N debate since these labels/comments are plain literals not XML literals... (is that correct)  </s>

<s> Hi Ralph,  </s>
<s> Doesn't XML say so?  </s>
<s> /me checks:  </s>
<s> "The intent declared with xml:lang is considered to apply to all attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless  </s>
<s> overridden with an instance of xml:lang on another element within that content." Max.  </s>
<s> really?!  </s>
<s> I'm very surprised (but pleased) if this is indeed the WG's consensus than an xml:lang on the root rdf:RDF element is sufficient to cause the graph to contain (in some manner) the information that all the strings are in French.  </s>
<s> great; thanks, Max.  </s>
<s> I was too lazy to look it up myself at the time.  </s>
