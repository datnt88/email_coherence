Hi folks, 
there is no change history for XAG. 
I propose that the changes from the previous draft be listed in each draft, with a seperate page collecting all the change histories together.

In each draft, then removed for public access hopefully? 
Or a clean version, with a section linking to such a marked up version? 
These would form the diffs and leave the clean version for reading?

My plan is to make the changes an appendix to each draft (thus available for public review so people can figure out what is going on). 
This is standard practice in many W3C specs.
