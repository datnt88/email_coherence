<s> The request actually came from exc-c14n.  </s>
<s> But that one relies on c14n for that particular aspect of its definition.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> In a very specific application, the 'inclusives list' works well.  </s>
<s> If you want to be general, it doesn't work well.  </s>
<s> One idea I recently thought about was to define an attribute of the form prefix:dummy to make a prefix and the associated namespace visible with exc-c14n.  </s>
<s> To take an example from the XML Schema Primer (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/#UseDerivInInstDocs) (simplified): ipo:purchaseOrder xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:ipo="http://www.example.com/IPO"  </s>
<s> If we take the shipTo element and canonicalize it, the Qname attribute value "ipo:UKAddress" will be invisible, and the 'ipo' prefix will become orphaned.  </s>
<s> The solution would be to write something like: ipo:purchaseOrder xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:ipo="http://www.example.com/IPO"  </s>
<s> It would be nice if there would be an uniform convention for the name of the 'dummy' element, but this can't be established throughout because there are no reserved attribute names (only the prefix is not allowed to start with 'x' 'm' 'l'; the actual attribute name can start with anything).  </s>
<s> But at least this can be done on a case- by-case basis.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> That would definitely be the approach I would propose if we were still writing that spec.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> I'm not confident of the scenario/requirement yet, but *if* Alice wanted to ensure that a prefix is always declared by some other person (Bob) corresponding to a attribute value, she could use an attribute with the same prefix to force its "visible utilization."  </s>
<s> However, I'd expect the interface between Alice and Bob would be sufficiently close in the cases that I think of, that she can pass the prefixes corresponding to QNAMEs to Bob; or if Bob really cares (since he's doing the c14n/signing), he can do the work of scanning for QNames and adding them to his InclusiveNamespace Prefix list himself...  </s>
<s> Hi Martin, had this issue come up while we were writing the spec I'm confident we could have provided the clarity, or maybe even an additional definition of a "canonical character sequence form" as Graham suggested, that you are seeking.  </s>
<s> However, I think it would be inappropriate to do such  </s>
<s> a definition now, and I'm not sure how to even add a "note" as an erratum.  </s>
<s> It doesn't quite fit into "a Caveat where subsequent experience has shown that a recommendation of the specification was incorrect or needs further qualification." [1]  </s>
<s> I don't object to the spirit of your text, and have tweaked it below: Note: Canonical XML is an octet sequence resulting from characters, from the UCS character domain, encoded in UTF-8.  </s>
<s> This is necessary for the purposes of XML Signature and other applications.  </s>
<s> However, some applications may require a canonical form of XML that is a sequence of characters, without concern for its encoding and representation as octets.  </s>
<s> As an example, it may be appropriate to choose UTF-16 rather than UTF-8 as the encoding of an API in a programming language using UTF-16 to represent Unicode strings, such as Java or Python.  </s>
<s> In such cases, applications are not prohibited from defining and using a canonical character sequence that corresponds to the characters of a Canonical XML instance.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is any better, and I'm not confident it should be an erratum, but perhaps you could use this thread in your discussions with others about whether the octet representation is really needed?  </s>

<s> I'm not seeking the addition of a new definition.  </s>
<s> I don't think it would be appropriate to add new definitions without starting a new WD-REC cycle, and I don't think this is important enough to do this.  </s>
<s> I guess it comes sufficiently close, the 'further qualification' seems quite adequate.  </s>
<s> The current text is slightly problematic because it says 'without concern for its encoding' and then goes straight on to mention UTF-16.  </s>
<s> UTF-16 indeed does not deal with octets, but it is still an encoding.  </s>
<s> Also, this version of the text doesn't mention abstract modeling anymore.  </s>
<s> It might also be better to replace 'may require' with 'may be better served with'.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hi Martin and others,  </s>
<s> Whether the c14n spec is "incorrect or needs further qualification" regarding this character sequence issue is debatable to me.  </s>
<s> It depends somewhat on the connotation of 'further qualification', which in the sentence comes across as 'almost incorrect' or 'partly mistaken'.  </s>
<s> There is nothing mistaken about what c14n does.  </s>
<s> It produces a canonical form for XML.  </s>
<s> Canonicalization in general is about picking one specific way of doing everything.  </s>
<s> Regarding encoding, we picked one way: UTF-8.  </s>
<s> We made this choice in part because encoding is part of the definition of XML 1.0 according to the Recommendation itself, so we wanted to pick one way of doing it.  </s>
<s> We chose UTF-8 because it was the most supported encoding, as guaranteed by XML 1.0 itself.  </s>
<s> We also made this choice because we wanted as a requirement be able to use the output of a canonicalizer as the input to a canonicalizer, thereby allowing statements like c14n(doc)==c14n(c14n(doc)).  </s>
<s> Right now, you are discussing the use of other encodings because it is logically equivalent in your application context yet more efficient to do so, not because there is anything incorrect, in whole or in part, with the method by which the current c14n achieves its primary goal.  </s>
<s> The fact that comparison of the UTF-16 encoding of an XML document might be equivalent to the UTF-8 encoding is an implementation detail.  </s>
<s> As long as the implementer can guarantee that what they are doing is completely equivalent within the application context to comparing the results produced by C14N, then the implementer can choose to implement in this fashion.  </s>

<s> It might also be better to replace 'may require' with 'may be better served with'.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> In the "caveat" category, I think my threshold is are we wasting many of the readers' time while banging their heads against the spec trying to figure something out.  </s>
<s> Granted the spec isn't incorrect, but they really want to do X and are looking for some guidance in the spec on how to do it.  </s>
<s> In this case, I think there was a genuine question of whether Canonical XML provides or precludes a encoding-less Canonical XML.  </s>
<s> I hope this discussion and the text in [1] is sufficient to document that it doesn't provide, nor does it preclude someone else from simply defining and using such a thing.  </s>
<s> I think there's also a conceptual disagreement as to whether one can have octets in a RDF graph, but I don't think that's our specification's responsibility to answer.  </s>
<s> So for the time being, I'm going to defer on an erratum.  </s>
<s> If the question comes up repeatedly, perhaps that will be further evidence that an erratum is necessary, or, more likely, that there's a requirement for new work.  </s>
