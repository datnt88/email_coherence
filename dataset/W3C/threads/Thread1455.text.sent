This is the final version of the deltav draft, which has been submitted to the IESG for approval and "nroff'ification". 
All issues raised during the IESG last call (which ended on September 7) have been addressed. 
The changes from draft 17 to draft 18 are described in the "changes and issues" document http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/changes-and-issues.htm . 
I'd like all of my co-authors to carefully review the text version of draft-18 (I have hand edited this version, to fix all of the various Word-generation anomalies). 
If any other member of the deltav working group has some time to review the text version, that would be greatly appreciated! 
Thanks to everyone in the DeltaV working group for all the hard work over the last three years! 
Now we can all focus on finishing up our implementations (:-). 
Cheers, Geoff A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories. 
This draft is a work item of the Web Versioning and Configuration Management Working Group of the IETF. 
Title: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Amsden, T. Ellison, C. Kaler, J. Whitehead Filename: draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-18.txt 
Pages: 106 This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. 
WebDAV Versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services.

In the body type: "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-18.txt". 
NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility. 
To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command. 
To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader. 
Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages. 
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.

Since "nroffification" does not appear to have been started, I decided to submit a new draft (draft 19) which fixes the typos detected in draft 18, by directly patching the ascii form (to avoid mechanical transformation errors). 
Many thanks to John Vasta, Roy Seto, and Peter Raymond for their hard work in finding these typos! 
Unfortunately, I submitted draft 18 before getting Peter's most recent message (adding "V3" to the activity diagram), but I'll make sure to get that changed in the nroffified version. 
There's still time to get typos fixed, so all reviews continue to be greatly appreciated!
