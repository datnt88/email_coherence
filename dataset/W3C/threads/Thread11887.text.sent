The developers agree it is beneficial and at best important ... After all, we're creating accessible pages today without integrated tools. 
Proposal to lower to priority 3 Regards, Phill Jenkins While we who know how to create accessible pages are doing it without the support of our tools, the rest of the people who are building web pages do not manage to make them accessible. 
The alternative to this is to educate every author as to the requirements of accessible authoring, and a rough idea of how to get around the tool, before they start using it. 
Since that is clearly impractical, I suggest that 5.2 remain at P1 and 5.1 retain the priority 2 that was proposed and accepted by the working group during the last call period.

People who are writing inaccessible pages are not all of a sudden going to change based on these proposals. 
Thus these proposals may be beneficial, they should be priority 3. Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns
