<s> Does anyone know of sites (English please) that are AAA compliant (besides the WAI) -- and brag about it?  </s>
<s> Kynn, why doesn't fly the AAA banner?  </s>
<s> (It can't just be because that orange/yellow clashes with purple?)  </s>
<s> And a not entirely theoretical question.. Can a site claim AA conformance without using CSS?  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.6 says to "use style sheets to control layout and presentation" but how strict is this?  </s>
<s> My interpretation is that a site would have to forgo B I CENTER FONT tags altogether and elements like ALIGN and BGCOLOR (I am sure I am leaving many others off this list) but then COULD be AA compliant without style sheets.  </s>
<s> What do you think of this interpretation?  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> I assume you left out the word AWARE ("why doesn't aware.hwg.org fly the AAA banner")?  </s>
<s> So far, laziness; I had the AWARE site designed before the logo was available, and I haven't taken the time to add it on.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what extra functionality it would add to the site, but it may be useful for promoting the guidelines.  </s>
<s> If I had 36 hours in a day I would have added it already; for now it will have to wait a while.  </s>
<s> [BTW, orange/yellow _could_ clash with various web pages; one big reason that many places don't display accessibility logos -- especially Bobby -- is simple asthetics.]  </s>

<s> Another question is "if you use tables at all for layout" (such as http://www.hwg.org/ or http://www.kynn.com/)  </s>
<s> "can you ever get a Double-AA rating?"  </s>
<s> 3.6 says to use CSS for layout.  </s>
<s> 5.3 says to use tables for layout only when they make sense when linearized.  </s>
<s> Both are priority 2. Proper use of tables according to 5.3 means you aren't following 3.6, right?  </s>
<s> I continue to have worries that the vague wording of 3.6 and the requirement that CSS _must_ be used for formatting and layout (instead of alternatives that web authors are familiar with, such as tables) means that for nearly any commercial site out there, at best a Single-A rating is possible if they feel there is a commercial disadvantage to using CSS.  </s>
<s> Why's this matter?  </s>
<s> Why not just say "okay, so they'll be Single-A"?  </s>
<s> Because the granularity of the compliance rating system means that if you don't get one, you don't have an incentive to try for the others.  </s>
<s> In other words, if you simply _can't_ comply with this one priority 2 checkpoint ("use CSS for layout"), then why bother complying with the others?  </s>
<s> You will still be only a "Single-A" compliance site no matter what else you do... Kynn Bartlett mailto:kynn@hwg.org  </s>

<s> Checkpoint 5.3 should be read as qualifying the effect of checkpoint 3.6 in relation to those layout functions which, until style sheets are better supported, may, subject to the qualifications in section 5.3, be performed via the misuse of table markup in HTML.  </s>
<s> Thus, one could still use CSS to control margins, borders, fonts, etc., thereby influencing the layout of the text to that extent, but also rely on tables to produce a columnar presentation.  </s>
<s> I think the most natural reading of the guidelines is that style sheets are to be used to the extent that they are supported by user agents, but that the use of tables for layout, under prescribed circumstances, is permitted at a priority 2 level.  </s>
<s> If the working group were to endorse this interpretation, it could perhaps be clarified in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> I see a conflict in Checkpoint 5.3 and 5.4.  </s>
<s> Would not it be easier to say, "Tables can be used for data and layout.  </s>
<s> For data, here is what you need for a Priority 1 and then list checkpoints that must be done to btain AAA level.  </s>
<s> For layout, tables must use do not use structural mark-up and you can only obtain AA conformance level.  </s>
<s> It is easy to read absurdities into the guidelines by considering individual checkpoints in abstraction from their context in the document as a whole.  </s>
<s> However, this is not an appropriate strategy of interpretation.  </s>
<s> I do not wish to imply that anyone has been misinterpreting the text deliberately.  </s>
<s> Rather, I would suggest that the tendency to concentrate on each checkpoint in isolation, for the purpose of judging compliance, naturally leads to the overlooking of important contextual details.  </s>
<s> Thus, if checkpoint 5.4 is read together with checkpoint 5.3, then it is clear that the uses of structural markup to create visual effects, against which 5.4 is directed, do not include the employment of tables for layout purposes as such, but comprise only the making of certain markup distinctions (such as between TH and TD elements) which imply structure, in cases where the author's intention is to force certain visual effects.  </s>
<s> The example in checkpoint 5.4 makes this clear.  </s>
<s> Similarly, checkpoints 5.3 and 3.3 can be read consistently with each other.  </s>
<s> Indeed, the note accompanying checkpoint 5.3 makes it clear that the use of tables for layout is a short-term exception to the requirement specified in checkpoint 3.3 that style sheets be used to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> No doubt, one could attempt to rewrite the guidelines so as to make all of the interrelationships among checkpoints explicit.  </s>
<s> The question to be considered, however, is whether the added complexity which would thus be introduced, is warranted, and whether there are significant and genuine ambiguities that need to be addressed.  </s>
<s> The role of the "techniques document" in clarifying the guidelines is also relevant, in that it provides more detailed discussion of the requirements which are succinctly expressed in the latter text.  </s>
<s> Please note that all opinions expressed in this message are mine alone and do not purport to reflect any discussion or consensus which may or may not have emerged in the Web Content Guidelines working group.  </s>
<s> if we are having this much of a problem interpreting the guidelines, just think how much trouble lay people in the field are having - not fun! rob  </s>
