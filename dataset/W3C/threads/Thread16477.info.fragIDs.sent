<s> Hello Charles: Good question.  </s>
<s> I don't want to generalize, so let me just give an example that does work.  </s>
<s> The example in section 11.2 of the  </s>
<s> HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 works fine.  </s>
<s> I hear "First name colon edit" then I hit tab and hear: "Last name colon edit" which is fine.  </s>
