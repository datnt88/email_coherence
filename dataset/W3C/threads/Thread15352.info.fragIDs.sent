<s> Dear I18N IG and GEO TF, Please see the attached note for a real-life instance of a person wanting to apply markup (span and abbr) within the title element.  </s>
<s> (This element only supports PCDATA in HTML4.01 and XHTML2.0).  </s>
<s> The need below is raised due to accessibility concerns.  </s>
<s> There may also be requirements to apply other phrasal markup, for example a span to  </s>
<s> support bidi attributes in Arabic and Hebrew contexts.  </s>
<s> I'd like to propose that the HTML group introduce support for phrasal markup in the title element in XHTML 2.0 (I assume it's too late for HTML 4.01).  </s>
<s> We can also make this request more generic.  </s>
<s> In a recent paper I argued that dtd designers should avoid putting ANY localisable text into attributes where possible.  </s>
<s> An example of this is the alt attribute in  </s>
<s> HTML 4.01.  </s>
<s> The text in alt sometimes needs span or bdo elements to support bidirectionality or language changes (particularly for voice browsers).  </s>
<s> In principle other phrasal tags could be useful too, such as em.  </s>
<s> To assist localisation it would also be very useful to be able to attach an id to the alt text.  </s>
<s> (In DTDs I design myself, I have used an image element that includes separate graphic and alt elements to get around this.) Although it perhaps presents a somewhat more difficult case, the title attribute calls for the same treatment.  </s>
<s> In addition, it is quite possible that the title text is in a different language to the text in the element to which it is attached.  </s>
<s> How do you make that clear if the title text is in an attribute?  </s>
<s> So I'm proposing that we ask the HTML group to consider: 1.allowing phrasal markup on the title element for XHTML2  </s>
<s> 2.avoiding the use of attributes containing localisable text wherever feasible Comments?  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>

<s> [Place all 'localisable' i.e. natural language text in elements, not attributes.]  </s>
<s> I think that the one thing I should add right away is that there  </s>
<s> is an option using "annotation" techniques to leave the attribute as is  </s>
<s> and introduce a higher-quality equivalent through a structure which  </s>
<s> refers to the attribute.  </s>
<s> This issue is coupled with providing clarifying information for natural  </s>
<s> language in all kinds of texts.  </s>
<s> PF will have a page in public on this topic in a few days.  </s>
<s> The PF history here is that lately we have been arguing for the SVG model over  </s>
<s> the HTML model for this reason.  </s>
<s> We just haven't got HTML to absorb the SVG model in this regard yet.  </s>
<s> HOWEVER, just what the structures should be is not necessarily given a final answer in the svg:title svg:desc pair of element types.  </s>
<s> This is related to the thread about "Should a browser use the ALT string as a tooltip?"  </s>
<s> running on the UA list.  </s>
<s> It's a genuine issue, the accessibility concerns are sympathetic with what Richard has suggested, but we still need a well-formed process to reduce this to features in the XHTML 2.0 specification.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I agree that this is an option in principle, but for the things  </s>
<s> we are considering ( span xml:lang='...' , ruby,...), it seems  </s>
<s> like an enormous overhead.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> And there are more things that need doing than you are considering.  </s>
<s> And  </s>
<s> somewhere along that line the preference for how to do it may flop over.  </s>
<s> It's not clear which way the overhead is greater.  </s>
<s> A 'span' on each instance  </s>
<s> could be much more size overhead when compared with a single glossary entry.  </s>
<s> But the latter is more risky because it is more indirect.  </s>
<s> I am trying very hard not to prejudge the choice, here, because in a  </s>
<s> migration strategy for an incompatible change I believe that there is a  </s>
<s> place for more than one way of doing things, and that we should not rush to judgement on how it is to be done.  </s>
<s> As I said at the end of the day Wednesday, what I am hoping the community will develop is better discernment about when to use which manner of annotation, inline and offline.  </s>
<s> Markup is inline annotation.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Yes, definitely.  </s>
<s> The more something applies in more than one place, for example, and the more it is part of one specific rendering rather than the 'original' text, the more sense it makes to put it offline rather than inline.  </s>
<s> The risk depends on how the items are matched.  </s>
<s> In Chales' examples, if the author of that page edits the title, the annotation still starts at character 19, but no longer at the right word.  </s>
<s> My current judgement is that we need both: - Better ways for inline annotation, not limited due to the fact that some things are in attributes when they shouldn't.  </s>
<s> - New (or better established) ways to link to glossaries and similar stuff.  </s>
<s> I think the community implicitly already has quite a good understanding of that distinction.  </s>
<s> On average, and for purely practical (but very important) reasons, inline markup seem to have performed much better in most cases, but there are good cases for offline stuff, too (in particular stylesheets).  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Note that using pointers that rely on the character position of a word in a sentence means that localisation of the data potentially becomes a nightmare.  </s>
<s> As the text changes, every single pointer will need to be changed for every single language involved - in a moderately to heavily annotated site this could introduce a huge overhead in schedule and cost that equates to a serious barrier to international deployment.  </s>
