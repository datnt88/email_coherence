<s> This is not possible with the current webdav spec.  </s>
<s> The source file must reside on a DAV-enabled server, or at least one that makes sense of a COPY request.  </s>
<s> However, Xythos' dav implementation makes this possible by supporting COPY with a Source: header.  </s>
<s> So you could perform your request with two transactions: COPY /temp HTTP/1.1 Host: www.W1.com  </s>
<s> Source: http://www.s2.com/D1/F1 COPY /temp HTTP/1.1 Host: www.W1.com Destination: http://www.s1.com/D1/F1 Again, assuming S1 supports PUT and W1 is an Xythos Dav server.  </s>

<s> - Jim Hi, I require a clarification in the functioning of the WebDAV.  </s>

<s> COPY /~D1/F1 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.S2.com Destination: http://www.S1/D2/F1  </s>
<s> If no, then what should be transaction to be sent across to W1? If yes, then : Would W1 create a file and retain a copy for itself while transferring it to S1 ?  </s>
<s> Any sort of clarification would be most welcome.  </s>

<s> COPY /~D1/F1 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.S2.com Destination: http://www.S1/D2/F1 No, the transaction would be performed by www.S2.com (since that is the host you sent it to).  </s>
<s> W1 is never mentioned in this request, and therefore is not involved in processing it.  </s>
<s> If no, then what should be transaction to be sent across to W1? Some have asked for a Source: header for COPY to allow you to copy to a WebDAV server (the Destination: header only lets you COPY from a WebDAV server).  </s>
<s> If both a Source and Destination header were supported at the same time by a server, you could get the functionality you are asking for.  </s>
<s> But note that a non-WebDAV server does not have collections, so even if you tried to copy something that looked like a collection (e.g. copying /x/y, when there is a resource /x/y/foo.html),  </s>
<s> unless you are copying from a WebDAV server, you would just copy the content of whatever GET would return from /x/y, and not a collection (or any properties, since only WebDAV resources have properties).  </s>
<s> I would probably vote against such a Source header for COPY, because of these edge cases around copying a collection, but I could be swayed (:-).  </s>
