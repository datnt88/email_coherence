Could group members please send your thoughts to the list regarding the proposed merger of the ERT and AU working groups. 
Just to clarify, the deliverables would remain the same, an AU Techniques Document, an ERT Techniques Document, etc. 
This would happen after the re-chartering of the two groups. 
Thanks Jutta On stardate 9 May 2000, Jutta Treviranus sent a subspace communication stating: I have no objection to this. 
Member: HWG Governing Board &amp; Assistant Secretary I think it is a really good thing, totally support.

Thanks Jutta After attending the AU-ERT meeting, I'm leaning away from the merger idea. 
ERT has a much wider focus than I was expecting. 
In particular, I think they see themselves as more of an Evaluation (of documents, authoring tools, browsers) and Repair (of documents on the authoring or browsing end) Tools group. 
Althought the AERT document is closely related to the AU work, the rest of the things they are planning are not as related. 
I do however, support the idea of joint conference calls once a month, as was proposed at the meeting. 
Perhaps this will lead to closer coordination without a merger.
