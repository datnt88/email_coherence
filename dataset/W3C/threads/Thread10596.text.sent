It looks like we need to make some minor revisions to the semantics doc. 
DanC has asked for a WG decision to approve the change. 
Eric, Sandro, will a decision at a telecon on 16 Jan 2004 be timely from your point of view? 
I think what we need is a clear description of the proposed changes for review. 
Pat, I see a proposal from you at: Have you and Herman agreed to this? 
I see Graham has reviewed it and is happy with it. 
If anyone has issues with approving this change, please raise them asap. 
Brian I will review this once Pat indicates this is the change he is proposing. 
I suggest we should also ask for feedback from Horrocks and Patel-Schneider (OWL Semantics Editor), cc-ing webont. 
[Herman does not speak for webont - in particular I note that at the last webont call he was in a minority on a different semantics issue - nothing wrong with that of course. 
It is conceivable that RDF Core might upset WebOnt by doing what Herman says] I am happy to raise this informally on webont, as part of my review. 
Jeremy I just checked with EricM; 16th is fine, but we can't slip beyond then. 
Dan * Brian McBride bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com [2004-01-08 17:03+0000] Warning: ill and grumpy I would value a proposal soon. 
When I last understood the status (quite a while back) it looked ok but it seems that the comments discussion is interminable. 
I also understood that it was fixing a procedural problem, i.e. due to a misunderstanding Pat promised some change to Herman and it did not get into the PR, and now we can suggest that that change goes into the Rec. 
I don't understand why you're still talking about ideas rather than proposing text. 
I am not 100% convinced that any change is needed really. 
(Of course, some change might be nice). 
I have a lot of sympathy on the procedural point. 
I am currently ill and grumpy. 
Having enough time to allow some feedback from the OWL Semantics editors is necessary, which means that Pat and Herman have got to stop talking to one another and ideally propose words that both agree. 
If not I would look to Pat to propose something. 
It is in some ways selfish to not get your conversation to the point of an easily intelligible proposal such as: "add these three words here, delete this one word etc." so that others can have a chance to understand it and comment with enough time for any further slight changes before we have to vote on Friday. 
At this stage I believe any change needs careful review, particular in the semantics doc, which has been a source of friction with webont. 
If a proposal is not made soon I may feel that the lack of review forces a vote against.
