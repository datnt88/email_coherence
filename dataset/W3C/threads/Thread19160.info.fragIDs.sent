Amaya is right. 
Only numeric values are allowed for the start attribute.

This is actually a feature, but it seems that it may look a bit complex. 
Let me try to explain what happens here, and why it happens. 
Suppose you have the following list: 1. aaaa 2. bbbb BBBB 3. cccc and the caret is in the middle of the second item, between bbbb and BBBB. 
A - The first Return allows you to split the content of item 2 into two paragraphs: 2. bbbb BBBB B - The second Return creates a new, empty paragraphs between those two paragraphs, but you still have a single list item: 2. bbbb BBBB C - The third Return splits the list item and creates a new one: 2. bbbb 3. | 4. BBBB If your goal was just to split the list item, you have to delete the new empty item (just do F2 and Del) D - The fourth Return splits the whole list and inserts a new empty paragraph between the two lists: 1. aaaa 2. bbbb 1. BBBB 2. cccc The story is a bit long, I agree, but making it shorter would skip one step (at least) and then prevent users from getting one (at least) of the structures listed above. 
If I understand you correctly, you suggest to skip step B (and possibly C). 
The second Return would then create: 2. bbbb 3. BBBB But how could you create a new paragraph within a list item (step B) or create a new item such as in step C? Vincent. 
An alternative approach might be to have a "split element" function, which would split an element at the caret. 
For example, in a list item, or a dd, or a link, i might have the following (source-code-sort-of) with the caret represented by the bar | just before the word "an". 
I could use the split command (ctrl x ctrl x or whatever) to make This is something I would find useful for links, list items and dd elements in particular, and perhaps for other items too. 
I wonder how it would work in a table - split a cell into two to create a new column? 
just create a new cell in that row, and stretch the others? 
If it was in a cell with rowspan Z, presumable it would create one cell without a rowspan and one with rowspan Z-1? (I agree that having the current behaviour for enter is a feature...) cheers chaals This is actually a feature, but it seems that it may look a bit complex.
