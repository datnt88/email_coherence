<s> Section 9.5 of RFC 2616 says: The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.  </s>
<s> Now, later on in the section it notes that POST covers other cases, e.g., - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process; but some people have taken the first sentence to be somehow definitional.  </s>
<s> ("is used" turning into "is only used" rather than "may be used").  </s>
<s> So I would suggest changing this wording -- and even putting up an errata -- that "The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as data to be processed by the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line."  </s>

<s> "The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept  </s>
<s> the entity enclosed in the request as data to be processed by  </s>
<s> the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.  </s>
<s> The entity SHOULD NOT include any instruction or direction to perform an action other than simple form-like submission."  </s>

<s> HTTP has been plagued by this debate for a long time.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer to  </s>

<s> The existing wording clearly fails this test (in that it attempt to create some sort of abstract notion using the term 'subordinate' in a way most people don't seem to understand).  </s>
<s> Your suggested wording adds a 'SHOULD NOT' that is not motivated by an interoperability issue - it is an expression of a policy preference: that other protocols should not be tunneled over HTTP.  </s>
<s> As such, I don't think it improves the clarity of the specification (especially since it does not make that motivation clear, leaving the reader to wonder _why_ one should not use it in that way, and because 'simple form-like submission' is hardly a tight distinction).  </s>
<s> I think that the changes Jeff suggests in his post are clear and policy neutral - just what is needed.  </s>

<s> No, that would be over-constraining the protocol (adding a requirement  </s>
<s> that isn't necessary for interoperability just means people will ignore the requirement).  </s>
<s> POST is still the place for spill-over semantics.  </s>
<s> However, I do think that the definition should include ALL of the things for which POST is used, including the semantics of usenet news and mail for which this method does continue to apply and for which Larry's  </s>

<s> There is absolutley nothing wrong with the definition supplied in RFC 2616.  </s>
