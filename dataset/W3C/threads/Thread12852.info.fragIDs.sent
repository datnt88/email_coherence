<s> Hi Charmane, I like the approach you have taken to this section.  </s>
<s> Without (I hope) changing your style I offer the following slight rewordings for discussion: In the second sentence of the introductory paragraph, I would add the word "savings" (but perhaps it is redundant in this context): "This efficiency may be reflected in manpower and direct cost savings to the organization.  </s>
<s> " Bullet 1: * Update and redesign time may be reduced by using an appropriate existing markup language to style and format text, formulae and images  </s>
<s> instead of using difficult to modify bitmaps.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 3.1) Perhaps the above change is a bit too jargony, but I think it comes closer to the original intent of Checkpoint 3.1.  </s>
<s> (In spite of the fact that there are people out there who think fiddling with bitmaps is much simpler than debugging CSS.) Bullet 2: * Writing documents that follow a published formal grammar and identifying it by including a DOCTYPE statement will facilitate efficient debugging with automated validation tools.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 3.2) This slight rewording makes the statement clearer (to me, at least).  </s>
<s> Bullet 3: looks fine to me.  </s>
<s> Bullet 4: You (and Henk?) ask whether "mobile" should modify "devices" in the last bullet.  </s>
<s> I don't think so, because they might not be mobile.  </s>
<s> You ask if "repackaged" should be "repurposed".  </s>
<s> I have eight English  </s>
<s> language dictionaries in my house but not one of them contains "repurposed".  </s>
<s> Granted, they're more than 8 years old.  </s>
<s> Is "repurposed" a word anywhere other than in W3C circles?  </s>
<s> Isn't "repackaged" easier to translate?  </s>
<s> (And, yes, I'm being hypocritical because I do use "repurposed" all the time... jargon is seductive.)  </s>
<s> I also agree with you that adding that list of W3C technologies is useful here.  </s>
<s> * The latest versions of W3C technologies (such as MathML, XHTML, XML, RDF, SMIL, CSS, XSL, XSLT, and PNG) have accessibility features built in.  </s>
<s> Using them facilitates web content repackaging to suit different displays, browsers, and devices without the need to create additional reformatted pages.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 11.1) Regards, Chuck Letourneau Starling Access Services "Access A World Of Possibility"  </s>
<s> Greetings, Suggested rework of "Reduce Site Maintenance" from "Technical Factors for Consideration in a Business Case for Web Accessibility" at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html  </s>
<s> I specified the technologies in the last bullet because most people won't have a clue what technologies you are talking about.  </s>
<s> At least this way they have a starting point and search out info on the technologies easily.  </s>
<s> "The latest versions of W3C technologies ....have accessibility features built in" came from http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#access-reviewed http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#access-reviewed  </s>
<s> Is this accurate?  </s>
<s> Like Henk, I wonder about including the word "mobile" with devices.  </s>
<s> I am also wondering about using "repurposed" instead of "repackaged" in the last bullet item.  </s>
<s> Reduce Site Maintenance Implementing relevant WCAG design techniques may reduce time spent on site development and maintenance.  </s>
<s> This efficiency may be reflected in manpower and direct cost to the organization.  </s>
<s> * Update and redesign time may be reduced by using style sheets, appropriate existing markup language, or text in place of images.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 3.1) * Writing documents and identifying the published formal grammar by including a DOCTYPE statement will facilitate efficient debugging with automated validation tools.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 3.2) * Controlling layout and presentation through a style sheet allows changes to affect the entire website at once rather than repeating the identical change in separate files.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 3.3) * The latest versions of W3C technologies (such as MathML, XHTML, XML, RDF, SMIL, CSS, XSL, XSLT, and PNG) have accessibility features built in.  </s>
<s> Using them facilitates web content repackaging to suit different displays, browsers, and devices without the need to create additional reformatted pages.  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 11.1) Charmane K. Corcoran Information &amp; Project Principal Michigan State University  </s>
<s> Here's an additional aspect for inclusion in the Technical Factors document.  </s>
<s> What follows isn't a draft text, just brainstorming.  </s>
<s> Using W3C technologies also reduces the effort and cost required in staff retraining.Technologies like HTML, XML have a wide base of experienced designers and developers.  </s>
<s> HTML as it is used today has been stable since 1997, XML since 1998.  </s>
<s> Users who learned HTML in 1997 find that their skills from that period are as valid to day as they were then.  </s>
<s> Using W3C standards protects investment in training, coding and content against changing versions of browsers and plugins.  </s>
<s> Content marked up using W3C languages will stand the test of time.  </s>
<s> Using W3C technologies avoids vendor lock-in.  </s>
<s> W3C technologies are the result of industry consensus.  </s>
<s> I think this is an important technical factor.  </s>
<s> Organisations spend large sums on hiring people to develop Flash, Java Applets and other proprietary formats.  </s>
<s> Also, it might seem like a format like SMIL implies an important training effort, as there are few people who know it, but at least once they've learned it, they can apply the knowledge across different multimedia formats.  </s>
<s> regards to all Alan Chuter achuter@teleservicios.es  </s>
<s> Here are some more ideas: Replace "manpower" and "time" with "effort" The point on validation could mention that validated code is less likely to need to be tweaked/rewritten for new browsers and versions.  </s>
<s> It can also be transformed and corrected.  </s>
<s> In the last point, perhaps "The latest versions" isn't necessary, as keeping up with the lates version implies increased maintenance.  </s>
<s> In the update and redesign point, we could delete "existing" or replace it wiht "standardised".  </s>
<s> I'm not clear about how built-in accessibility features reduce site maintenance, perhaps this should explained.  </s>
<s> "Repackaging" might be better expressed as "repurposing" or "reuse".  </s>
<s> In the last sentence, I think "access modes" or "multimodal access" and "devices" are the words to use.  </s>
<s> regards to all, Alan Chuter achuter@teleservicios.es  </s>
