<s> Below is the revised Q&amp;A I have taken out references to codes and markup languages in the main sections of this Q&amp;A.  </s>
<s> Because this is meant to act somewhat like an introduction to our area, I felt that it was important to include some mention of these in order to provide the reader with suggested next steps (those being to learn a little more about each of the standards mentioned).  </s>
<s> I discussed them briefly under "Further information."  </s>
<s> Thanks, Phil Questions &amp; Answers: Initial considerations for international web sites Question What are some topics to consider when creating websites for an international audience?  </s>
<s> Background People from around the world can view your content on websites.  </s>
<s> Because much of what we find on the web is written with a specific demographic in mind, it is often the case that people outside of that demographic misunderstand what has actually been intended.  </s>
<s> The formatting and presentation of text has very specific regional and cultural requirements that need to be addressed if the content is to be properly understood.  </s>
<s> Answer A typical challenge is to ensure that characters display correctly for the end user.  </s>
<s> Web pages can easily accommodate English, Germanic, and Romance languages, but what happens when an occasional foreign word or name is used?  </s>
<s> In the past, a quick solution was to use an inline graphic to display the character.  </s>
<s> Another method was to copy and paste the desired character from another program into the web page.  </s>
<s> While the result might look correct for one user, there is no guarantee that every user will see the same text.  </s>
<s> There are many variables that might need to be considered, such as the font, operating system, browser software, etc.  </s>
<s> These concerns are becoming increasingly important as users move toward mobile and other non-standard browsing devices.  </s>
<s> As many languages read from right to left, the ability to include such content becomes an even greater challenge.  </s>
<s> In addition to identifying the proper characters, there also needs to be a method of properly handling this text.  </s>
<s> Some cultures use a comma as a thousands separator and a period as a decimal point, while other cultures use the period and comma, respectively.  </s>
<s> For example, 1,547 in Germany and 1.547 in the United States are actually the same number.  </s>
<s> While the only difference in this example is a single character, the difference in meaning is significant.  </s>
<s> The presentation of dates and times are a very typical example of something that causes confusion for the user.  </s>
<s> When using two digits each to represent year, month, and day, the actual date might not be obvious.  </s>
<s> A few examples from different cultures include DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, and YY/MM/DD.  </s>
<s> A single date in the format "xx/xx/xx" could be interpreted as three different dates.  </s>
<s> There are many other concerns that should be addressed as well when creating an international-friendly site.  </s>
<s> This is only a sampling of some of these.  </s>
<s> By the way...  </s>
<s> In its simplest definition, "internationalization" refers to creating a site framework that allows for content to be presented in a way that is consistent with regional styles and cultural customs.  </s>
<s> "Localization" refers to the actual implementation of each specific region's content into the international framework.  </s>
<s> Internationalization is commonly referred to as "i18n" because there are 18 characters between the beginning "i" and concluding "n."  </s>
<s> Similarly, localization is commonly referred to as "l10n."  </s>
<s> When starting to create an internationalized site, one must first give consideration to the various locales that need to be considered.  </s>
<s> This will help to define the requirements for the international framework.  </s>
<s> It is highly recommended to work with native speaking people who are very familiar with the regions and cultures that are part of your user demographic.  </s>
<s> Most importantly, the end user must understand that a page has been localized.  </s>
<s> It is a good practice to indicate or imply that the content has been formatted for their local formats.  </s>
<s> This avoids questions and possible misinterpretations.  </s>
<s> Further information This Q&amp;A provides only a few introductory points on this topic.  </s>
<s> There are many books devoted to the topics of internationalization and localization.  </s>
<s> Becoming familiar with the styles and customs of other regions and properly implementing these elements into a web site will ensure that content is available to -- and truly understandable by -- a larger audience.  </s>
<s> Some of the standards typically used to create internationalized web sites include the following: - XML [ www.w3.org/XML ] is the preferred markup language for defining content.  </s>
<s> In addition to identifying the actual content, it can also include attributes that further define aspects of the content (such as language, grammar style, and current format of the content).  </s>
<s> Other web languages (such as XHTML) use these attributes to deliver the localized page appropriate for the current user.  </s>
<s> - XHTML [ www.w3.org/MarkUp ] is the successor to HTML, and is a markup language used to define web pages and to properly format and display XML content within them.  </s>
<s> - Unicode [ www.unicode.org  </s>
<s> ] is a numbered collection of the characters of all of the languages in the world.  </s>
<s> Using this standard ensures that the correct character will be displayed, regardless of the browser or system.  </s>
<s> Properly utilizing these standards in a web site can ensure that the concerns mentioned above are properly handled.  </s>
<s> We're a bit behind on this question.  </s>
<s> Any comments from anyone?  </s>
<s> RI Richard Ishida W3C  </s>
<s> I think this is a very good start.  </s>
<s> But I think first we have to think about what "international web site" means.  </s>
<s> It could be: - Site in one language, but for an international audience - Multilingual site (and there are various ways a site can be multilingual) - Site in a language other than English (?) - A 'secondary' site in that its content is translated/adapted from  </s>
<s> another one  </s>
<s> - One of multiple sites with coordinated content in different languages The issues and considerations, and the answers, are different for different cases.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> This makes a great Q&amp; A all by its own!  </s>
<s> How about:  </s>
<s> What is an "international" or a "multilingual" web site?  </s>
<s> These are ambiguous terms that can refer to several different kinds of web sites.  </s>
<s> An international site can refer to:  </s>
<s> - Site in one language, but intended for a global audience i.e. more than one country market.  </s>
<s> - Site in a language other than the author's native language.  </s>
<s> - Multilingual site  </s>
<s> The term "multilingual site" can refer to: - A site where pages use more than one language.  </s>
<s> (Because the readers are expected to be multilingual, or the content is by nature multilingual.  </s>
<s> For example, a european author mixing English, French and German in a weblog or a page talking about the Rosetta Stone.) - A corporate regional site with content that is translated/adapted from another one  </s>
<s> - One of multiple sites with coordinated content in different languages It is important to distinguish between these kinds of sites.  </s>
<s> The design, development and deployment issues and considerations, and the solutions, can be different for each case.  </s>

<s> I'd add at least another two to the list: - a site in more than one language intended for a local culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community.  </s>
<s> - a site in (one) national language and containing resources in multiple languages intended for mediated access by a local culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community.  </s>

<s> I can't argue with a man that has Multilingual right in his job title!  </s>
<s> If CALD is a standard term: - I'll add it to the glossary - perhaps we should give some examples and or links for more information.  </s>

<s> Hi Martin, I think that Offices sites fall into (are close to) these two last cases.  </s>
<s> More over, those sites which use other alphabets, have non English-like languages and parts of their content is translated/adapted from W3C site.  </s>
<s> The last case may then be - A site (why secondary) where contents might be translated/adapted from another one.  </s>
