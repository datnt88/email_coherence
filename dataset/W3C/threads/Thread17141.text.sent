From: "Daniel Hillier" DHillier@visionict.com Subject: FW: CSS and absolute sizes Just working on a CSS designed what is the current thinking about using absolute sizes within the CSS sheet for borders and page layouts? 
Nothing wrong with absolute sizes for layout (for example widths, paddings and margins), as long as the text is still readable when resized. 
Most fixed width layouts cannot handle textsize being increased, then readability and accessibility are affected. 
Hi Just working on a CSS designed what is the current thinking about using absolute sizes within the CSS sheet for borders and page layouts? 
What aspect would it be acceptable to use absolute sizes with in CSS but maintaining website accessibility? 
Daniel Pardon? 
Fixed size means fixed size. 
If you say 10px, it means ten pixels no matter what. 
You should not rely on the user's ability to override something that you have said as something absolute, even though such possibilities exist. 
There are practical reasons to use absolute sizes. 
To take a simple example, consider a very thin border for a box. 
Using the keyword thin as border-width creates a not so thin a border. 
Using, say, 0.03em might create no border at all, since the browser might round it to zero pixels. 
So using 1px or 2px might be reasonable. 
But let's not make it a virtue. 
What we would like to have is something that is as thin a possible but still noticeable with respect to the font size. 
For padding, for example, absolute sizes are no-no. 
Using any fixed amount of padding is a shot in the dark when the font size may vary as much as it can.
