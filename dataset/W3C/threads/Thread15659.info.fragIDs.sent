<s> I have been trying to figure out a way to incorporate this into our discussion and drafts but it is so different I havent been able.  </s>
<s> Apologies to Ian for holding on to it so long as I tried.  </s>
<s> As you will see it's is quite different from organization to what constitutes guidelines.  </s>
<s> It doesn't meet many of our requirements but it shouldn't be taken as a complete set of guidelines -- but rather a collection of ideas we may find useful in different ways.  </s>

<s> I think XAG requirements deserve to be at the same level as WCAG requirements.  </s>
<s> In the proposal linked below, the basic idea is that  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 would say "To build accessible content, you start with a format that supports accessibility."  </s>
<s> What defines  </s>
<s> "an accessible format"?  </s>
<s> Another series of requirements that are already well-known to the WAI Community: * if the format supports audio, it must also support the ability to associate a synchronized transcript.  </s>
<s> * if the format supports images, it must also support text equivalents, And so forth.  </s>
<s> These are some of the XAG requirements today.  </s>
<s> They themselves have techniques associated with them: * What's a good way to allow authors to provide alternatives?  </s>
<s> The "alt" approach of HTML or the "switch" element of SMIL?  </s>
<s> What are the advantages of each approach?  </s>

<s> I agree with Ian.  </s>
<s> These need to be at the same level.  </s>
<s> If the languages and data formats do not provide support for storing the information needed later when developing content it is hard to make the content accessible.  </s>
<s> Marja  </s>
<s> My vote is with Ian too on this- it is more then techniques to conform to WCAG.  </s>
<s> If we want to change WCAG to be more like XAG however....  </s>

<s> On Behalf Of Ian B. Jacobs Sent: Saturday, March 27, 2004 4:28 PM Subject: Re: FW: Mock-up of merged WCAG 2.0 and XAG  </s>
<s> I'm happy to attend a call.  </s>
<s> I'd like to make one more "promotional" comment: When I have read WCAG 2.0 drafts over the past year, I have noted a struggle to include requirements such this one in the 11 March 2004 draft [1]: "The following can be derived programmatically (for example, through a markup or data model) from the content without requiring user interpretation of presentation.  </s>
<s> ... hierarchical relationships such as paragraphs and lists... emphasis on specific words..." There are tons of format specifications out there.  </s>
<s> They don't all include markup for emphasis or lists, nor should they.  </s>
<s> I don't believe it will help authors to say "Use emphasis" if they are using a format specification that does not include markup for emphasis!  </s>
<s> Hence, the proposal suggests that WCAG 2.0 say the following:  </s>
<s> a) Authors should use accessible format specifications and use them as follows to create accessible content.  </s>
<s> b) To make an accessible format specification, do the following: i) If it includes audio, do the following.. ii) If it includes video, do the following.. iii) If it's a basic document language, use something in the HTML family.  </s>
<s> And do forth.  </s>
<s> Of course, authors will not be able to influence very often the design of "accessible formats"; this is why I think XAG is so important and why I would like to see it get done as quickly.  </s>
<s> Why do I think this model will speed up work?  </s>
<s> I think it's much easier to start with a statement like "Assume the author is using a format that supports accessibility" and to work from there.  </s>
<s> The first requirement that comes to mind is "Authors must use the accessibility features of the format; see part two of this document where those are discussed."  </s>
<s> Then, the rest of "Part One" of WCAG can focus on HOW authors use those features to create accessible content, e.g., by building clear navigation, by using simple language, etc. Thanks for reading the proposal,  </s>

<s> As the current editor of the document, and having been involved in XAG and WCAG from their first drafts both as a W3C staff and once again now as an outsider, I would like to offer a few reflections: I think it would be helpful to have a recommendation that distills what accessibility groups including the WCAG and PF groups have learned about how to make formats that support accessible content.  </s>
<s> I am not sure that merging this work with the WCAG work would get us to WCAG 2.0 faster.  </s>
<s> There are some outstanding issues in WCAG 2.0 that would need to be resolved if these two were to be merged.  </s>
<s> While they are separated, the question of what is really the responsibility of the author, and what is the responsibility of the user agent, has a low impact on XAG.  </s>
<s> Similarly, XAG currently has a single level conformance scheme.  </s>
<s> It is clearly designed to direct the author of a schema in the way they work, in a way that does not suggest it would be easy to merge with the current WCAG conformance approaches.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, there has been no charter, and so no real work on XAG, for some time.  </s>
<s> It is currently lacking in techniques which would allow some reasonable testability, and despite some work that has been done on automatic testing, XAG seems likely to be reliant on substantial human judgement for a while yet.  </s>
<s> I think Ian is correct that being able to say "use accessibility features available", "use an accessible format" and "use the semantics of a format according to specification", rather than trying to list lots of requirements is a step forward.  </s>
<s> In order to produce something useful, at least developing that to a comprehensive set of techniques for HTML, and preferably for half a dozen formats, is important.  </s>
<s> Otherwise people are left with some nice principles but insufficient guidance.  </s>
<s> SMIL, SVG, MathML, PDF, Flash would be the sort of list that Sidar would like to see.  </s>
<s> Incorporating the XAG work has the benefit that WCAG is actually chartered, and has the right to publish W3C working drafts, whereas since PF has not been in that situation for a while I have not written a new draft.  </s>
<s> It has the drawback that there is some substantial work to be done, and the PF group has developed some understanding about what that work involves and the techniques and approaches available.  </s>
<s> But then the current proposal for a charter for PF [pfc] suggests maybe making XAG a note - that is, something of less status than a normative document.  </s>
<s> Where do we want to go with this?  </s>
