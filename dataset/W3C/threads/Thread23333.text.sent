hello. 
i have just published a report describing a proposal for an xlink data model. 
it is available at and proposes to define a data model for xlink based on the xml infoset. the report's abstract reads: "This report describes a proposal for a data model for XLink. 
It defines the data model as contributions of XLink to the XML Infoset. 
The data model is meant as a clarification of the link model implicitly defined by XLink. 
It is also meant as the foundation for future work on XLink, for example a DOM module for XLink support, a CSS module for styling XLinks, or a protocol for accessing XLink linkbases." 
my goal is to have this (or an improved ;-) version of the xlink infoset being specified as a w3c recommendation, so that other activities (such as dom and css) can build on top of it. 
possible developments are: - an xlink dom3 module - css3 selectors for linking information - css3 properties for link formatting - xsl-fo properties for link styling - a protocol for linkbase access in my opinion, all these things should be done to promote xlink and to help to make the xml-based web a hypermedia systems, where things can be easily linked. 
if there is enough support, then i hope that w3c will start to define an xlink infoset. 
i am very curious to hear what people think of this idea. 
i know that xlink is not everybody's darling, and that xlink's success so far has been less than stellar, but i hope that we cann still change this by providing users with a better framework for working with xlink.

first of all, i think that the data model should be a separate document, so that others (dom, css, ...) can reference it properly. 
more specifically, the infoset contributions in the older proposal have the following shortcomings: - they do not allow resources in links which do not belong to an arc. 
xlink allows this, so it should be covered in the data model. 
- arcs always have exactly one start resource and one ending resource. 
in xlink, an arc can have any number of start an ending points, so this should be covered in the data model. 
- there is no way to point to a link from the markup that specifies that link. 
- i don't like the concepts of defining the model using "element information items". 
this in part is a result of the rather vague way of how the infoset's set of data types has been defined, but i think the xlink infoset items should be defined without reusing existing items. 
- i found the modeling of the arcs a bit weird. 
arc items point to participant items which point to a resource, but the resources (if they are local resources) directly point to the arcs. 
i hope this helps. 
i think that the link2rdf note also is a good starting point. 
i simply did not at it for a while because of some of its limitations which make it more restricted than xlink is.
