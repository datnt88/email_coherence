<s> Hello! While reading WAI Accessibility Guidelines I encountered many references to `Central Reference Document'.  </s>
<s> But I don't know what is it.  </s>
<s> Please help me.  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance, Dima, 5-th year student of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  </s>
<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> The latest version of the guidelines, available from the Page Authoring working group home page http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ , no longer contains references to the Central Reference Document.  </s>
<s> It used to be a repository of techniques and information for authors, user agents, users, and assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> It has been superceded by the most recent guidelines and techniques documents.  </s>
<s> However, a repository that will link all of the various WAI guidelines and contain the mutual definitions is being proposed and designed.  </s>
<s> We hope that all the information you need to create accessible web pages can be found in the guidelines and techniques documents.  </s>
<s> Thanks, --wendy  </s>
<s> Review of  </s>
<s> I'll start with the overall sectioning.  </s>
<s> In I exposed ideas for a simpler structure, which I think had received some good backup on the list (from Nir, Charles).  </s>
<s> I notice in this version that things have changed toward a simplified organization, good, but I still have some issues.  </s>
<s> Since there was no discussion with the editors on the list about this issue, I wonder if there is agreement but misunderstanding (I doubt that, knowing Wendy :-), or a different opinion as to what should be used for section grouping (so let's talk about it)  </s>
<s> A. Make sure pages transform gracefully across users, techniques,  </s>
<s> and situations A little too long for a section head IMHO, but the that's the idea.  </s>
<s> Maybe "A. Degrade gracefully" "A.  </s>
<s> Graceful Transformation" or just "A. Textual Equivalence"  </s>
<s> More to the point, I think the following guidelines belong in a B extended to "Structural/Navication" issues.  </s>
<s> A.6. Ensure that text and graphics are perceivable and understandable when viewed without color A.7. Indicate structure with structural elements, and control presentation with presentation elements and style sheets A.9. Provide supplemental information needed to pronounce or interpret abbreviated or foreign text.  </s>
<s> A.12. Use features that enable activation of page elements via  </s>
<s> input devices other than a pointing device That's because these are not about degrading in text but adding semantics for a better understanding and easier navigation.  </s>
<s> and I think  </s>
<s> A.14. If, after all of your best efforts, any page is still not  </s>
<s> accessible then you MUST provide a link to an alternative page Should come last, so probably in C.  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] This guideline should be followed by an author to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will improve access to WWW documents.  </s>
<s> For P3, I'd suggest using "may", not "should", so that it gives us a clean IETF look-alike must/should/may wording.  </s>
<s> Each Guideline and each Technique has a priority listed.  </s>
<s> For the guidelines, the priority refers to the importance of addressing the issue identified by the guideline.  </s>
<s> For Techniques, the priority refers to which technique best improves accessibility with respect to this guideline.  </s>
<s> For example, a Priority 1 Guideline may have a Priority 1 Technique, which must be done to provide accessibility, and a Priority 3 Technique, which may also be done to help address the issue.  </s>
<s> Meta-question: what is going to be the W3C Recommendation ?  </s>
<s> Just the guidelines document, or both the guidelines and the companion  </s>
<s> techniques document ?  </s>
<s> W3C has the notion of non-normative annexes, and  </s>
<s> we could attach (even in a separate file, it doesn't matter) the techniques as such.  </s>
<s> What about the "leading" techniques section after each guideline, is that going to be normative ?  </s>
<s> I think it should stay in the main guideline document in any case, as they really help understand the issues.  </s>
<s> 1. Provide alternative text for all images, applets, and image maps.  </s>
<s> This includes images used as submit buttons and all of the  </s>
<s> In the interest of genericity, that is, being able to reuse these guidelines for other markup language (in XML), we should abtract what we mean by image, imagemap, applet.  </s>
<s> I think providing a definition of it at the end is OK, we don't need to change the terms used (even if they are HTML specific).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, users who are blind, have low vision, or have chosen not to view graphics will not know the purpose of the visual components on the page.  </s>
<s> Instead of "have chosen not to" I'd say "cannot view graphics" otherwise people might react "Oh, you don't *want* to see my graphics, then get lost".  </s>
<s> 1. For all images (IMG) provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> We should have a lead to spacer images, bullets and difference between pure decoration and functional images at that point, with pointer to more detailed techniques.  </s>
<s> 2. For all applets (APPLET) provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute) and content.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> I suggest "and content (OBJECT)".  </s>
<s> 4. Don't use server-side image maps unless the same functionality or information is available in an alternative accessible format.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 5. For all graphical buttons (INPUT type="image") provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute) [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> INPUT image is a special case of server-side image, and alt-text alone doesn't provide the necessary information in most case.  </s>
<s> There are to be avoided at all cost, since it's very unlikely that people will provice a list of text links next to an INPUT button (ISO HTML did not retain INPUT image for instance).  </s>
<s> 7. If OBJECT is used to incorporate an image, applet, or script into a page, use any of the many ways to convey that information in cases where the OBJECT cannot be perceived.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> If we're going to have the techniques be non-normative, we need to be a little more careful and try to have sentence that stands by themselse, so when we say "use any of the many ways" is a too vague.  </s>
<s> 2. Provide descriptions for graphics, scripts, or applets that convey important information unless they are already fully described (through alt-text or in the document's content).  </s>
<s> [Priority1]  </s>
<s> This guideline has technique wording in it, I'd just remove these words " unless they are already fully described (through alt-text or in the document's content)."  </s>
<s> and add the document's content part as a technique as well.  </s>
<s> 3. Provide textual equivalents (captions) for all audio information.  </s>
<s> I repeat what I have said before, I think captions/transcripts should only be required for *important* information, much like longdesc for image, and a clear definition of important should be provided, that is applicable to image, audio, video, etc: something is important if understanding it in details is necessary for the overal understanding of the document (thus the need for a longdesc, a complete transcript, etc)  </s>
<s> If someone puts some audio music in the background, I just need to know that with a title or some label.  </s>
<s> If someone is asking me to click here to hear their last new song for appreciation, getting a transcript of the song words in not going to help, although it could be helpful for some other reasons.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if a video of the rep from Swissair is the only media used to get some news about a crash, then it better be provided as text as well.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, users who are deaf, or hard of hearing, or who have sound turned off cannot perceive the information presented through speech, sound effects, music, etc.  </s>
<s> Same remard, "people who have turned sound off" should be "people who do not have sound on their computer" for instance.  </s>
<s> 1. For short animations such as animated "gif" images, provide alt-text (see A.1)and a short description (see A.2) if needed.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> "short descrition" ?  </s>
<s> You mean "long" ?  </s>
<s> 5. Design documents in a way that allows alternative presentations to be provided.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> This one is far-fetched.  </s>
<s> Why would someone design document in a way that do not allow for alt presentation to be provided if she/he intends to provides them ?  </s>
<s> Techniques: 1. Ensure that the source of each frame is an HTML file.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> I'd remove this one and move the Frame technique in the technique document by itself (see my comments there)  </s>
<s> 6. Ensure that text and graphics are perceivable and understandable when viewed without color.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> OK, that's a structural thing and should be in B.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Otherwise, if color is used to convey information, users who cannot differentiate between certain colors (and users with devices that have non-color or non-visual displays) will not receive the information.  </s>
<s> When foreground and background colors are too close to the same hue, they may not provide sufficient contrast when viewed using monochrome displays or by people with different types of color blindness.  </s>
<s> Techniques: 1. Don't use color to convey information unless the information is also clear from the markup and/or text.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 2. Use foreground and background color combinations that provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone with color blindness or when viewed on a black and white screen.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> There are two different issue here.  </s>
<s> Using color instead of markup is one, and should be a structural item, folded into the next guideline in fact, and avoid poor contrast is a different thing altogether, and should be put in C, with things that make sense, but that UA - and most UA do - can help with, so it's less important.  </s>
<s> 3. Do not use an image map to create a set of buttons in a form.  </s>
<s> Instead, use separate buttons or images (accompanied by alt-text).  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> I don't understand this one.  </s>
<s> 4. Use style sheets to control layout and presentation wherever possible as soon as a majority of browsers in use support them (see  </s>
<s> I'd add "support them well".  </s>
<s> then, tables (to control layout) and bitmap text with alt-text  </s>
<s> I'd add "simple table"  </s>
<s> 4. Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker between 4 and 59 Hertz.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> Where the heck did I put my radio-frequency analyser ?  </s>
<s> Ah I know, it's with Gramma' cold fusion reactor in the basement.  </s>
<s> Seriously, what do we expect people to do with that ?  </s>
<s> 14. If, after all of your best efforts, any page is still not accessible then you MUST provide a link to an alternative page that: Rationale: 1. is accessible, 2. has equivalent information, 3. is updated as often as the inaccessible page.  </s>
<s> This is not a Rationale.  </s>
<s> Rationale is: it's bad to duplicate but it's better than being not accessible.  </s>
<s> Techniques: 1.  </s>
<s> Until user agents and screen readers are able to handle text presented side-by-side, all tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns require a linear text alternative (on the current page or some other).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> I was happy to see some good-sense coming in for using simple TABLE for layout above, but now that: requiring parallel text-only version of table.  </s>
<s> This is suicidal.  </s>
<s> I repeat my notes from before: - it's a UA issue, and it's not specific to TABLE but to anything a UA can only layout side-by-side.  </s>
<s> Example: I can use CSS float instead of TABLE, but IE will not let the user override my float (turn off CSS completely that is) so the problem remains.  </s>
<s> We, as a group, seriously need to draw the line between what's for UA to deal with, and what's for Authors to deal with.  </s>
<s> More or less everything can fit below or above the line we draw: ALT text for image for instance: a very sophisticated UA could use OCR technology to extract ALT text from any images.  </s>
<s> Of course, we don't want to say that, but we need to be realistic about what is common practice/doable in 1998.  </s>
<s> Color contrast for instance is clearly for the UA to resolve, and so is linearization of simple TABLE.  </s>
<s> 2. Avoid phrases that are not meaningful on their own such as "click here."  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> A P1.  </s>
<s> 1. Use Bobby, an automated accessibility, browser and HTML validation tool, available at http://www.cast.org/bobby/  </s>
<s> [Priority 3]  </s>
<s> A P1 or P2.  </s>
<s> 2. Use the W3C HTML Validation Service, available at  </s>
<s> P1  </s>
<s> 3. Use the W3C CSS Validation Service, available at  </s>
<s> P1  </s>
<s> 4. Test the site with at least: o a text-only browser (e.g., Lynx or a Lynx emulator such as Lynx Viewer or Lynx-me) [Priority 3]  </s>
<s> P2 Coming up some comments on the Techniques.  </s>
<s> Daniel, thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> you raised quite a few issues!  </s>
<s> See our comments interspersed throughout yours.  </s>
<s> thanks for your faith, Daniel.  </s>
<s> grin Yes, we agreed that the organization needed to be simplified.  </s>
<s> We heard that from a few people.  </s>
<s> Thus, we took the suggestions we were given and worked out what you have read in the most recent release.  </s>
<s> We think it works pretty well grin , and would like to comment further on your suggestions for moving a few of the guidelines around.  </s>
<s> More comments follow.  </s>
<s> A. Make sure pages transform gracefully across users, techniques,  </s>
<s> We'll leave it for now.  </s>
<s> Although it is a bit wordy, we hope it is clear and can stand well on its own.  </s>
<s> A.6. Ensure that text and graphics are perceivable and understandable when viewed without color A.7. Indicate structure with structural elements, and control presentation with presentation elements and style sheets A.9. Provide supplemental information needed to pronounce or interpret abbreviated or foreign text.  </s>
<s> A.12. Use features that enable activation of page elements via  </s>
<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> The first section (A) is about "Graceful transformations."  </s>
<s> A transformation is not necessarily a textual representation of a graphical or auditory element.  </s>
<s> It could be a still image of a frame from a movie, or auditory descriptions of the visual presentations within a movie.  </s>
<s> So, our definition of transform gracefully is, "a page remains usable despite user, technological, or situational constraints."  </s>
<s> Therefore, A.6, A.7, A.9, and A.12 are definately guidelines for graceful transformation.  </s>
<s> A.14. If, after all of your best efforts, any page is still not  </s>
<s> again, this is the last ditch way to make a page transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> so we believe it should stay where it is in A.  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] This guideline should be followed by an author to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will improve access to WWW documents.  </s>
<s> already done (Charles Mc. had the same comment).  </s>
<s> Each Guideline and each Technique has a priority listed.  </s>
<s> For the  </s>
<s> guidelines,  </s>
<s> the priority refers to the importance of addressing the issue identified by the guideline.  </s>
<s> For Techniques, the priority refers to which technique best improves accessibility with respect to this guideline.  </s>
<s> For example, a Priority 1 Guideline may have a Priority 1 Technique, which must be done to provide accessibility, and a Priority 3 Technique, which may also be  </s>
<s> done to  </s>
<s> help address the issue.  </s>
<s> The recommendation will be just the linearized version of the guidelines (to be posted after this is sent).  </s>
<s> The techniques will be a separate non-normative document.  </s>
<s> However, links to the techniques document will appear throughout the guidelines - as they appear now.  </s>
<s> (The "leading" techniques are the items in the techniques column?)  </s>
<s> 1. Provide alternative text for all images, applets, and image maps.  </s>
<s> This includes images used as submit buttons and all of the  </s>
<s> so, if we leave this technique link as is, but include a definition in our definitions, this will satisfy this concern?  </s>
<s> How about:  </s>
<s> image: a graphical element presenting information visually  </s>
<s> image maps: images that contain links  </s>
<s> applets: applications that can not stand alone (i.e., a sub-process that runs within a user agent process space).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, users who are blind, have low vision, or have chosen not to view graphics will not know the purpose of the visual components on the page.  </s>
<s> how about "or any users who have chosen not to view graphics."  </s>
<s> Some people choose not to view graphics either because they can not due to a physical disability, or they have chosen not to because it would take too long to download.  </s>
<s> 1. For all images (IMG) provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> we think it best to leave the link as is, and provide the detail in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> 2. For all applets (APPLET) provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute) and content.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> content may be provided using the APPLET element.  </s>
<s> OBJECT is covered in technique #7 ("If OBJECT is used...).  </s>
<s> 4. Don't use server-side image maps unless the same functionality or information is available in an alternative accessible format.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 5. For all graphical buttons (INPUT type="image") provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute) [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> exactly, which is why we have technique A.6.4 ("do not use an image map to create a set of buttons...") and per the earlier e-mail response to Marja-Ritta we are moving it into A.1  </s>
<s> 7. If OBJECT is used to incorporate an image, applet, or script into a page, use any of the many ways to convey that information in cases where the OBJECT cannot be perceived.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> since this sentence appears in the guidelines (which will be normative) and we aren't sure what all is possible or needed, we were purposefully vague with this one.  </s>
<s> 2. Provide descriptions for graphics, scripts, or applets that convey important information unless they are already fully described (through alt-text or in the document's content).  </s>
<s> [Priority1]  </s>
<s> some of the technique type of wording is needed in order for an author to determine if they need to follow this guideline.  </s>
<s> alt-text is "a" technique described under "alternative text."  </s>
<s> How about we change this to, "2.  </s>
<s> Provide descriptions for graphics, scripts, or applets that convey important information unless they are already fully described (through alternative text or in the document's content).  </s>
<s> [Priority1]"  </s>
<s> 3. Provide textual equivalents (captions) for all audio information.  </s>
<s> hmmm, this sounds similar to: "If an image is decorative, what do we put for the alt-text?" because *something* is needed.  </s>
<s> It's going to depend on how the audio is incorporated into the page.  </s>
<s> If someone provides a text link to the audio clip, oftentimes the link phrase provides sufficient information.  </s>
<s> In your example, I would argue that a transcript *should* be provided since there are many ways to appreciate a song.  </s>
<s> If the artist is not only a good guitar player but a poet as well, I'm gonna want to read  </s>
<s> those lyrics.  </s>
<s> However, if it's Beethoven's 9th, will I provide the score?  </s>
<s> No, but the caption "Beethoven's 9th played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra" should be sufficient.  </s>
<s> Therefore, all audio gets captioned.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, users who are deaf, or hard of hearing, or who have sound turned off cannot perceive the information presented through speech, sound  </s>
<s> effects,  </s>
<s> music, etc.  </s>
<s> not exactly, see comment re: images.  </s>
<s> 1. For short animations such as animated "gif" images, provide alt-text (see A.1)and a short description (see A.2) if needed.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> oops. yep.  </s>
<s> 5. Design documents in a way that allows alternative presentations to be provided.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> yes, this one got stretched pretty thin to accomodate the technique.  </s>
<s> We've been wrestling with it for a while and earlier this week folded the technique (source of a frame must be an HTML file) into frames transforming gracefully (as you suggested, also).  </s>
<s> 6. Ensure that text and graphics are perceivable and understandable when viewed without color.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> Well, it could fit into "separate structure from presentation" but we thought it would be easier for an author to understand and find if we grouped the two color techniques into one color guideline.  </s>
<s> 3. Do not use an image map to create a set of buttons in a form.  </s>
<s> Instead, use separate buttons or images (accompanied by alt-text).  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> see earlier discussion about image maps.  </s>
<s> 4. Use style sheets to control layout and presentation wherever possible as soon as a majority of browsers in use support them (see  </s>
<s> agreed.  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
<s> then, tables (to control layout) and bitmap text with alt-text  </s>
<s> o.k. done.  </s>
<s> 4. Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker between 4 and 59 Hertz.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> tee-hee. if we change Hertz to "flashes per second" does it still make you want to dig out the analyser from the basement?  </s>
<s> We can't provide a good way to determine the high end (the low end is fairly simple), but know it is an established set of limits.  </s>
<s> any ideas?  </s>
<s> hmmm.  </s>
<s> What you have as rationale is part of the guideline.  </s>
<s> The rationale is, "Some pages will be unable to transform gracefully at this time either because the visual components are too complex, or because assistive technologies or user agents (browsers) are lacking a specific feature.  </s>
<s> For example a complex table (e.g., of text and numbers) must be converted into a linear version."  </s>
<s> yes, it is a UA issue and luckily a couple UAs have made some headway on this (lynx and Jaws).  </s>
<s> So, we are moving this to A.12 - "Use interim accessibility solutions so that assistive technologies and older browsers will operate correctly" and making it a Priority 2.  </s>
<s> 2. Avoid phrases that are not meaningful on their own such as "click here."  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> we continue to disagree with this one.  </s>
<s> a series of "click here's" does not make the page inaccessible.  </s>
<s> Meaningful link phrases make the page easier to use.  </s>
<s> a p2.  </s>
<s> 1. Use Bobby, an automated accessibility, browser and HTML validation tool, available at http://www.cast.org/bobby/  </s>
<s> [Priority 3]  </s>
<s> using bobby does not make a page accessible.  </s>
<s> nor does it necessarily make it easier to use.  </s>
<s> we think this ought to remain a p3.  </s>
<s> 2. Use the W3C HTML Validation Service, available at  </s>
<s> see comment about bobby.  </s>
<s> 3. Use the W3C CSS Validation Service, available at  </s>
<s> see comment about bobby.  </s>
<s> 4. Test the site with at least: o a text-only browser (e.g., Lynx or a Lynx emulator such as Lynx Viewer or Lynx-me) [Priority 3]  </s>
<s> still only a good practise.  </s>
<s> does not necessarily increase the usability or accessibility of the page.  </s>
<s> we think it should remain p3. --editors and chairs  </s>
<s> Following Daniel's extensive comments...  </s>
<s> I agree that validating HTML/CSS is important, but ensuring it is valid can be done manually or by a validator.  </s>
<s> If the technique said: Check source code against the HTML 4.0 Spec [href] or use an automatic validator such as ... then I think it should be P1, since having valid code is P1. Bobby is not a P1 - one of the reasons is that it is not always correct.  </s>
<s> Manual checking is potentially better.  </s>
<s> Again, maybe that should be in the techniques somewhere.  </s>
<s> Column layout is a P1 problem.  </s>
<s> it ought to be UA, but the problem has been created already.  </s>
<s> It may (in the future) go away.  </s>
<s> But at present it is crucial for a relatively small group of people, and the likelihood that they will all get good software and machines which run it in the next six months may not be that high.  </s>
<s> The problem is the same as D-link vs LONGDESC - it ought to be a UA problem, but the legacy (for all users) of history means that it can only presently be solved by the author (using a D-link).  </s>
<s> I still think that table layout of columns is P1.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there is a wider problem.  </s>
<s> TABLE is there because we use a lot of tabular information (think of spreadsheets).  </s>
<s> It is possible to use an alternative format (linearise the table) and the algorithms are not even terribly complex in most cases (especially where the table has a structure, rather than being arbitrarily constructed for layout reasons).  </s>
<s> But they are not well-implemented (I understand there is an implementation for the w3 browser in emacs, but when I was playing with Jason White looking at websites he didn't have the table package, and as a consequence tables were a problem.  </s>
<s> (Jason, what do you think about this one?) Charles McCN  </s>
<s> I still disagree, but I guess we're down to expert/religious opinion, so I'll give (just tell me why A.6 is in A and B.2 in B, rather than both in B)  </s>
<s> again, A.14 (text-only page) is the last ditch way to make a page transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> so we believe it should stay where it is in A.  </s>
<s> I view it as the last ditch to make a page *accessible*, so I'll put it at the end of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> That's the way we should do it, but we need to be very careful that the normative part holds together as a unit.  </s>
<s> We need to add in the notion of "still" I think, vs. moving/video which come later.  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as an application that can stand alone: they all stand on a lower layer (down to the silicium), and in the case of an applet, the lower layer is just an interpreter embedded in a browser.  </s>
<s> I thing a better characterization for applets is the notion of "mobile code", that is, programming code (by opposition to declarative markup) that is downloaded in a user agent and run in this context.  </s>
<s> If I'm using a mobile browser, I just *cannot* view graphics: my browser doesn't fetch them and show them.  </s>
<s> You might argue that I chose to use this image-less mobile browser, but maybe not, maybe that's what my company had bought for me.  </s>
<s> So where is my case in your list ?  </s>
<s> I am not blind, doesn't have low vision, and I have not chosen not to view graphics.  </s>
<s> How about we have both "or any users who cannot or have chosen not to view graphics" ?  </s>
<s> Sure, the details should be in the techniques, but the way it is now, it's hard to find the list bullet alt and the space alt details.  </s>
<s> Wherever the direct links to these techniques are (please tell me), it seems obvious to me that they should also be here (redundancy helps, there is already some for imagemap I think).  </s>
<s> We cannot be that vague in a Recommendation.  </s>
<s> If you take Technique 1 in this list "For all images (IMG) provide alt-text", this is not vague, this is very precise, and the techniques document answers the next series of questions about what goes inside alt-text.  </s>
<s> I think we should mention that "For OBJECT, specify alt-text either with the "title" attribute or in the body of the OBJECT element", and point to the techniques.  </s>
<s> How about all the words of the "Ode to Joy" ?  </s>
<s> (last movement, which is also the European Anthem - see http://europa.eu.int/en/eu/anthem.html)  </s>
<s> These are important to caption!  </s>
<s> To me, "Beethoven's 9th played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra" is not a caption, it's a title.  </s>
<s> So here, we have an interesting case: I'd argue that if what you're putting online is the 9th, then a descriptive title is enough, not need for attaching all the lyrics, but if what you're talking about in your page is Anthems, then you need to provide transcript for this part, because that's an important aspect of the information.  </s>
<s> Same things goes for regular songs or audio.  </s>
<s> Only the author can judge what is important or not.  </s>
<s> It's not that it could fit into "separate structure from presentation", it's exactly what it is, and setting it aside just adds to number of guidelines, which is bad.  </s>
<s> More to the point, as an author, what control do I have over the frequency of moving element on the user agent side ?  </s>
<s> probably close to none.  </s>
<s> So I would just say "Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker" and mention the Hertz thing in the technique documents.  </s>
<s> Good  </s>
<s> OK, can you remind me what it means to have a P1 Technique for a P2 Guideline ?  </s>
<s> You're right in theory for the priority on Bobby, HTML validation, etc, but in practice, if we keep them to P3, we're not encouraging their use, and that's bad, because they really help catching a lot of things.  </s>
<s> So I would really prefer to extract them from the Guidelines set and put them (the whole C.4) at the end, as an annex.  </s>
<s> In fact, these are not guidelines about page content, but guidelines about page validation (i.e. tool), so they ought to be set aside from the rest.  </s>
<s> Couple of new comments:  </s>
<s> A.2. Provide descriptions for graphics, scripts, or applets if they are not fully described through alt-text or in the document's content.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> I'd add ".. for important graphics"...  </s>
<s> A.7. Ensure that moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating objects or pages may be paused or frozen.  </s>
