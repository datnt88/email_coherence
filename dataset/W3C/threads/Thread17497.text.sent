JRGs response to Joe Roeder: I don't think there is any single reason for browser sniffing. 
It something that is happening right now and affecting technology used by persons with disabilities. 
Especially since persons with more severe disabilities do not tend to use the most popular browsers. 
So the goal of this discussion is to determine what WAIs response should be. 
You seem to have suggested that if the guidelines are followed by the major browser developers, then the problem is the same for everyone reguardless of disability. 
Jon John, Let me respond to your points in reverse order. 
You said: JRG in response to Joe Roeder: The one scenario that has been presented is banks requiring a specific browser to do bank transactions, so if you are using lynx you are out of luck. 
This scenario is probably based on security. 
JSR: If security features, especially in financial transactions, is desirable, then there can only be 2 solutions: either put the security features into LYNX and other popular browsers or make sure the browsers that have the security feature are accessable to persons with disability. 
My point is based on the assumption that LYNX and other browsers might not want to add the security feature, so if the disabled person wants to communicate with that server, they will have to choose another browser. 
This may seem like limiting the user'soptions, but what is the alternative? 
I also assume that including these security features is not going to be a WAI recommendation. 
That leaves recommending that browsers follow the accessability guidelines, which is what we are doing anyway. 
JRG in response to Joe Roeder:Some sepcialized technologies for people with disabilities are being denied access. 
Not all the denials are for security reasons, some people want to force users to use a particular browser so that you see there WWW pages as the author intended. 
It may also be a marketing strategy being used by server/browser developers to promote there products over competing products. 
JSR: This is clearly a problem of bad web design. 
Not only do such sites block access by persons with disability, but they probably discourage a lot of non-disabled who can't or won't take the time to switch browsers just to look at this site. 
If they convert their site into an accessable one per the WAI guidelines, then browser sniffing becomes unnecessary, doesn't it? 
I don't mean to be difficult about this. 
It just seems to me that if the guidelines are followed, then the problems surrounding browser sniffing go away. 
And if that is the case, then what more needs to be said about it?

"Browser sniffing" is no different than a Windows or Macintosh application checking the version of the operating system it's running on. 
How many applications check to see if they are running on Windows 3.x or Windows 95? 
There is nothing morally wrong with this. 
If the end-result is inaccessibility, deal with that issue. 
Preventing "sniffing" isn't the answer. 
As a browser developer we must say that browser sniffing is a problem. 
The result is that we need to say that we are Netscape to get pages that are ok or even get pages at all in some cases. 
What would have been much better is to be able to ask for pages using a system where you say whether the browser and user want certain things such as - frames - tables - java - javascript - images This allows the page designer to take these things into consideration and deliver an optimal page. 
Sadly, some of them will just say "turn on feature X". Regards/Ciao/K?r kvedja/Vennlig hilsen/... Jon S. von Tetzchner Opera Software Jon@operasoftware.com Opera - The browser that is made for you. 
Of course there is a difference. 
The point is that the user doesn't need to be on a certain platform. 
He can be on any platform. 
He can have any kinds of needs. 
What the designer of the web page should know is what the program and user are capable of handling or like. 
Not only which program it is as the users of the program can have different requirements. 
Let's put it this way: - A designer wants to check if the browser can handle frames. 
- It finds the browser is Netscape X.Y, MSIE A.B or Opera F.G. - These browsers can handle frames so he returns a framed page. 
- The user, however, would like a non-frames page. 
- (Please do not tell me they can use the noframes tag. 
A lot of companies do it this way). 
Designers are using browser sniffing because there isn't a better way to check what functionality the browser and user support. 
If there was an easy way to check this they would do that. 
Simple as that.
