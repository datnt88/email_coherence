There is a minor bug affecting debugging in the subroutine &amp;update_master_log. 
open (TMP2, "$conf- {ErrorLog}"); should be: open (TMP2, " $conf- {ErrorLog}"); Alan Meyer AM Systems Randallstown, MD U.S.A. Okay Thanks for this one... Clement Onime Okay, I final got round to looking into this and it is not a bug at all.. There is a sub-routine called &amp;check_file_name that tries to check the name of the log files and this sub-routine prepends "  " to variables such as $conf- {ErrorLog}. 
SO it works fine (infact using your modification stops proper operation of update_master_log) with out your modification. 
Thanks Clement Onime
