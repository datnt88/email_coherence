<s> 3) A dichotomy between "DTD-ful" and DTD-less parsing will make any sibling-based relationship difficult at best; this will affect some TEI or HyQ based hyperlinks, as well as sibling-based stylistic decisions.  </s>
<s> However, it will _not_ cause a problem for a large class of applications; namely those in which extraneous whitespace is irrelevant (full-text indexers, web-walkers, etc.) or is dealt with separately by the application (CSS-based formatters, any formatter based on TeX or TeX-like algorithms, etc.) Extraneous whitespace _can_ cause a problem for DSSSL-based formatters, but I don't think that's a big problem either (please see below).  </s>
<s> 4) The only way to avoid the dichotomy is to preserve these whitespace nodes even when a DTD is present.  </s>
<s> That's one way to avoid it, but it's not the _only_ way.  </s>
<s> I propose the following: * If the author fails to provide a formal document type definition, then all whitespace is assumed to be significant (as per (1), above).  </s>
<s> * If the author does provide a formal document type definition, then applications must examine the DTD to determine where whitespace is significant.  </s>
<s> I think this will work.  </s>
<s> A large class of applications simply _do not care_ about the distinction between element and mixed content: they will produce the same results in either case.  </s>
<s> Applications in that class do not need to examine the DTD.  </s>
<s> I see this issue raising a distinction not unlike the issue addressed by the 'Required Markep Declaration' already provided for in the spec.  </s>
<s> Where the RMD says what is required to parse this document properly (or at all), we are now talking about what is required to properly parse white-space.  </s>
<s> I don't really like the -xml-space attribute, it does a reasonable job os the simple cases.  </s>
<s> (It still is a bit rough though, as this whole discussion has pointed out.) When a document (or it's DTD) is too complex for this simple tool to handle it, the document should just be able to demand that the DTD be processed in order for white space to be parsed properly.  </s>
<s> A DSSSL display engine would tell it's XML parser that it cares about white space, and the XML parser might thus be required to retrieve the DTD when it might not otherwise have needed it.  </s>
<s> Similarly, a server which servers complex XML documents, might normalize the documents such that white space processing was not neccessary (assuming it has access to the DTD).  </s>
<s> Somewhere, someone has to take into account white-space/RE handling.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> indication is that the user can not always be expect to take on this burden, so someone else must carry it, in those cases where is significant.  </s>
<s> Applications that do care about the distinction will need to examine the DTD.  </s>
<s> I do not see this as an onerous burden for any of the applications in this class that have been mentioned so far: all the ones listed so far will need to examine the DTD anyway (in order to process general entity declarations), and compared to the effort involved in (say) writing a DSSSL-O engine, parsing content models to see if they contain a #PCDATA token is just not that difficult.  </s>
<s> This assumes that the issue with DTD's is the complexity of parsing and processing the DTD.  </s>
<s> If the issue is the bandwidth required for passing the DTD, then these arguements do not hold.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I have encoundered many documents where the DTD is an order of magnitude larger than the instance.  </s>
<s> (Whether this is bad design on the part of SGML or the document architect is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> I still believe it may be common) I am concerned that a document parsed as XML (as opposed to SGML) will require different HyTime location addressing, or a different DSSSL style sheet, than if the same document was parsed as SGML.  </s>
<s> Such a situation defeats a number of the goals of XML, mainly it's SGML compatibility.  </s>

<s> Which is to say, probably most: So if we go with a scheme of "required DTD downloading to handle 'complex' whitespace", either XML will get a "rep" as a hard to use language where you must type this: or as a language where you must basically always download the DTD.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Is this a valid summary of your proposal:  </s>
<s> The spec should require the application to read the DTD for proper whitespace handling of element content.  </s>

<s> Taking into account such rules as ignoring RE's immediately following start tags or immediately preceeding end tags (some people seem to think this is in the spec, I didn't look very hard, but didn't see it right off... but something like that should be there), your summary is exactly what I mean.  </s>
<s> Whether a stylesheet is sensitive to extra whitespace/RE's is dependant on the style sheet, but there are a number of HyTime location addressing mechanisms which WILL break if pseudo-elements show up where they were not there before (or disappear for that matter).  </s>
<s> It has been mentions that some TEI locators will also break.  </s>
<s> I have no real problem with keeping the -xml-space attribute also.  </s>

<s> In one of my versions of what I posted (I rewrote portions of it a number of times as my ideas solidified), and may not have made it off my computer, I mention that there should be some simple rules to allow from some whitespace/RE's to be ignored.  </s>

<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I don't follow this line of reasoning... Applications only care about the DTD if they need information in it that is not available from the instance alone.  </s>

<s> This is, after all, how it works in the base language SGML.  </s>
<s> [*] I believe that Derek Denny-Brown is proposing the same thing.  </s>
<s> Note that in XML there already is information in the DTD that is not available from the instance (the replacement text of non-predefined entities -- which DSSSL and HyTime engines will need, so we're not asking them to do a whole lot more work), and I'm willing to bet that before we've finished with hyperlinking [**] there will be even more information in this category (e.g., #FIXED attributes and/or architectural declarations).  </s>
<s> [**] Speaking of hyperlinking, does anyone have any ideas how this should be specified?  </s>

<s> Abstraction (1) is what HyTime and DSSSL call the "SGML document grove" or the "pGrove" (for parse grove).  </s>
<s> What can occur in this grove is completely defined by the SGML property set (published in the DSSSL standard and soon to be published again in the HyTime TC) and reflects simply applying the SGML parsing rules to the input document.  </s>
<s> It is roughly equivalent to "ESIS" except that the grove may be more complete and you have a formal way to say what you want to be in the grove (the "grove plan").  </s>
<s> Abstraction (2) is what HyTime calls the "extended SGML document grove", or "epGrove".  </s>
<s> This is a new grove with HyTime-specific semantics applied.  </s>
<s> It uses the same propery set as the first but may either suppress or remove some things or may modify the content to reflect HyTime-specific semantics.  </s>
<s> Any application is free to create it's own extended document grove.  </s>
<s> XML processors will, presumably, provide their own XML-specific extended document groves to reflect XML-specific semantics (for example, that whitespace is collapsed when the -xml-space attribute is in effect).  </s>
<s> Any location addressing applied against XML documents would, presumably, be applied against the XML epGrove (or possibly a location-method-specific grove derived from the epGrove), not against the pGrove.  </s>
<s> In terms of Eliot's enlightening discussion, I would state my feelings as follows: I would like to define well-formed XML so that the pGrove for any well-formed XML is equivalent to the epGrove against which we apply our location addressing.  </s>
<s> I'd like to avoid introducing an application-specific epGrove in between well-formed XML and addressing into that well-formed XML document.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's a HyTime-specific issue, both because the problems are not unique to HyTime and because the use of HyTime is not dependent on how the parsing process is defined.  </s>
<s> All location addressing, whether HyTime-defined or not, operates on an abstraction of the data, not the original source data.  </s>
<s> This means that you have to choose your abstraction carefully, which is what we're really  </s>

<s> There are two levels of abstraction that we usually work with: 1.  </s>
<s> The immediate result of parsing.  </s>

<s> XML processors will, presumably, provide their own XML-specific extended document groves to reflect XML-specific semantics (for example, that whitespace is collapsed when the -xml-space attribute is in effect).  </s>
<s> The -xml-space attribute is a good example of how this works in practice: an XML parser parses a document and creates a pGrove that contains all the data characters it found.  </s>
<s> If the document has no DTD, then this means all white space characters, not just those in what we know to be mixed content (white space that is not taken as data is held in "markup" properties, which are not, by definition of the SGML property set, content of the objects that exhibit them--thus these characters may be in the grove but they aren't part of the content of the elements in which they occur).  </s>
<s> An XML processor then operates on the pGrove to produce an XML epGrove in which the rules for -xml-space are applied, i.e., lists of white space character nodes in the content of elements where white space gets collapsed get replaced with single space character nodes.  </s>
<s> (Notice I didn't say "characters get replaced", the operations are on nodes in groves, not characters in strings, and each character is a node.)  </s>
<s> Any location addressing applied against XML documents would, presumably, be applied against the XML epGrove (or possibly a location-method-specific grove derived from the epGrove), not against the pGrove.  </s>
<s> Of course, the problem of knowing how to produce the XML epGrove consistently remains.  </s>
<s> However, having these two stages can make it clearer where the processing can happen and *why* using attributes to control it is not necessarily a hack because the attributes are *not* feeding back into the base parsing process (at least conceptually)--they are affecting the construction of application-specific groves and applications are free to use any information at their disposal to control grove construction.  </s>
<s> Note also that grove plans are not sufficient to solve this problem because grove plans only include or exclude entire classes of object or entire property values--they can't selectively exclude things: that requires a specific grove construction process.  </s>
<s> Note that there's absolutely no requirement that applications actually perform the grove constructions described above as discrete steps--most XML processors will go directly from source data to XML epGrove without first constructing the intermediate pGrove.  </s>
<s> But note also that HyTime (and DSSSL) can operate with equal ease on either grove and it could be possible to have both available and indicate which you actually want to address when doing addressing.  </s>
<s> (Whether this is practically useful or not, I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.)  </s>
<s> Finally, I'd like to point out that from a HyTime perspective (in the new grove-based world) any addressing notation that can be defined in terms of node lists selected from groves can be naturally integrated into a HyTime-based system.  </s>
<s> For example, TEI locators, whose grove-based results should be obvious given knowedge of the grove plan used, could be easily, meaningfully, and usefully used in conjunction with other HyTime-defined location addresses.  </s>
<s> Thus, it's not really useful to talk about "HyTime addressing" versus other forms of address: it's all the same stuff at its core and the problems posed by the data abstractions we're creating are the same.  </s>
<s> Thus the issue of, for example, whether we should prefer TEI locators over SDQL queries is an issue of appropriate syntax and user interface, not functionality [for what it's worth, I will probably end up prefering TEI locators over SDQL for XML use because it was specifically designed to meet the requirements we presume the main XML audience to have].  </s>
