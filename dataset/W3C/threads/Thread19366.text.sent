I do not know the reasoning for making XHTML case sensitive. 
But it sure will cause problems. 
And it flies in the face of backwards compatibility and the history of all that has gone before. 
Even now only a small percentage code for html 4 correctly. 
Many could care less. 
And to add unnecessary restrictions and geek code for color is madness!! John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Mystery readers may want to click on DOROTHYL XHTML is case sensitive because XML is case sensitive. 
There are a few restrictions added by making HTML available in XML, but the reason is to make it much easier to process. 
Although there will be some backwards compatibility problems for a little while, most software can already produce lower case, and fixing compatibility to XHTML will also solve a number of other bad practices common in HTML. 
being able to style elements in the source view is pretty helpful - colour is a common appraoch, another is to use bold text for code elements. 
(Colour alone means a tool cannot comply with W3C accessibility Recommendations).

Uppercase is one reason that breaks the parsing of old HTML documents but the most important cause is that many HTML documents are not well formed.
