<s> Concerning the notion of 'well-formed' lists, there is a  </s>
<s> characterization of the RDF graphs which describe such lists in the relevant section of the semantics document.  </s>
<s> Here is a more exact and careful statement of that characterization.  </s>
<s> Define a 'link' in a graph G to be a subgraph consisting of two triples of the form  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:first bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:rest ccc .  </s>
<s> where ccc may be rdf:nil, but otherwise aaa and ccc are bnodes or urirefs which are not in the RDFS namespace.  </s>
<s> Call aaa the *addr* of the link, bbb the *head* of the link, and ccc the *tail* of the link.  </s>
<s> Define a 'line' in G to be a finite subgraph of G consisting of links and satisfying the following conditions: exactly one link in the line has rdf:nil as its tail; otherwise, every link's tail is the addr of exactly one other link in G; one link in the line has an addr which  </s>
<s> is not a tail of any other link - call this the *addr of the line* - and otherwise, the addr of every link in the line is the tail of  </s>
<s> exactly one other link in G; and no addr or tail (except rdf:nil) in the line occurs as the subject or object of rdf:first or rdf:rest elsewhere in G.  </s>
<s> Given any line, the sequence of denotations of the heads of links obtained by starting with the addr of the line and following the tails in order, is the *list denoted by the line*.  </s>
<s> Semantic extensions of RDF may well want to require that addrs of lines denote  </s>
<s> the list denoted by the line.  </s>
<s> This allows the heads of links to be the addrs of other lines, so it allows arbitrary S-expressions, in LISP parlance.  </s>
<s> To restrict oneself to 'linear' lists, add the condition that no head of any link in the line occur as the subject of any rdf collection property in G.  </s>

<s> Ummm... I assume this is intended to describe a "well-formed list" -- it's not obvious to me (other than by prior experience) what part of this is a well formed list.  </s>
<s> I don't recognize anything here that prevents the following:  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:first bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:rest ccc .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:first ddd .  </s>
<s> being regarded as two distinct links: aaa rdf:first bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:rest ccc .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:first ddd .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:rest ccc .  </s>
<s> in that these are both subgraphs of the original.  </s>
<s> You talk of the *addr of the line* as being a link that is not the tail of any other link.  </s>
<s> Why this restriction?  </s>
<s> Isn't every link the head of some line?  </s>
<s> I'm not really comfortable with this description; it seems easier to me to  </s>
<s> adopt a recursive strategy: (a) a *link* in G is a subgraph of the form  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:first bbb .  </s>
<s> aaa rdf:rest ccc .  </s>
<s> where aaa denotes an object of type rdf:List, and there are no other statements in G of the form: aaa rdf:first yyy .  </s>
<s> or aaa rdf:rest zzz .  </s>
<s> Call aaa the *addr* of the link, bbb the *head* of the link, and ccc the *tail* of the link.  </s>
<s> (b) a (well-formed) *line* is one of the following: (i) rdf:nil (ii) a *link* whose head is any node, and whose *tail* is a (well-formed) *line*.  </s>
<s> (I considered offering a recursive definition for the list thus denoted, but that seems unnecessary.)  </s>
<s> I'm assuming we'll allow full s-expressions.  </s>
<s> DO we need to say anything explicitly about this -- I think it follows from the (intended) definition.  </s>

<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> True, I should have said that the links in any line are disjoint, ie define a line as a set of *disjoint* links.  </s>
<s> Yes, but each line has a unique link containing its addr.  </s>
<s> Yes, that is rather neat.  </s>
<s> They are equivalent on finite graphs, but yours is more elegantly stated.  </s>
<s> Yes, but all the applications Ive seen (eg DAML, OWL) only need linear lists, so I suspect many folk will appreciate a concise way to state that restriction, is all.  </s>
