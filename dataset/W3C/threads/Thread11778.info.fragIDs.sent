<s> Checkpoint 3.2.5, dealing with Accessibility help, requires a link to validation services.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the use of validation should be a checkpoint within 2.1 "generate standard markup", and that the use of bobby-style accessibility evaluation is largely covered already.  </s>
<s> However it is probably a good idea to point to available tools in the techniques document.  </s>

<s> I agree that they should be mentionned, but tools should not rely on outside checkers to perform checks, since (1) these may become too busy if a large commercial product started linking users, (2) it won't help offline and (3) they are not integrated with correction.  </s>
<s> I agree, and would add (4)where quality control is important it can be a pretty foolish thing to do.  </s>
<s> But what I was really thinking of wass those tools which are in fact publicly available as pieces of software, and as models for a module which could be included in an authoring tool.  </s>
<s> It would seem sensible to add the points you raise to a discussion of these tools in a Techniques document.  </s>
