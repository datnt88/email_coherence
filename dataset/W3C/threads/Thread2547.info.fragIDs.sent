<s> Fact: some people hate cookies.  </s>
<s> They keep telling their browsers not to accept them.  </s>
<s> A simple-minded way to write some kinds of server-side applications is to make sure a browser has a cookie by re-issuing it under certain conditions, such as not receiving a cookie header in the request.  </s>
<s> It's annoying to have to have server side state to indicate whether  </s>
<s> you think you've already sent someone a cookie, in order to avoid annoying a user who may be deliberately rejecting cookies.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't there be something in the cookie-related part of the protocol so a client can tell a server not to send a certain cookie?  </s>
<s> It would be nice if it could specified at the level of a particular cookie, so a user could be particular about which ones to accept and reject.  </s>
<s> Then, if a user told a browser not to accept a cookie, the browser could include a header line on subsequent requests whose meaning would be something like "Hey!  </s>
<s> Remember that cookie you tried to send me?  </s>
<s> Well, don't!"  </s>
<s> I'm not proposing a specific implementation - just wondering if there's any reaction here to such a thought.  </s>
<s> Are repeated pop-up warnings a protocol problem?  </s>
<s> Seems to me they're a UI problem, not a protocol problem.  </s>
<s> The browser _could_ (though indications are the browser companies don't see the value in this) provide a better set of cookie-rejection options to, for instance, avoid bugging the user with repeated pop-ups.  </s>
<s> Point taken.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, if the browser people are not up to the task you suggest, chances are they will not be up to the task I suggested either!  </s>
<s> --Shel  </s>
<s> An alternative I proposed was that servers beable to stipulate that cookies are required for an application to function.  </s>
<s> I forget the details of what I suggested or the brief discussion thread.  </s>
<s> But one must ask why users hate cookies and wonder what UI and/or server and hence perhaps protocol support might change that situation.  </s>
<s> Larry Masinter recently 'suggested' that perhaps getting a better solution to state management warranted a new WG.  </s>
<s> If the UA vendors expected to provide a high percentage of the desk top UAs were interested, I believe there a number of avenues left untested in terms of providing better support from all perspectives for state management.  </s>
<s> As I recently noted in a post to the StateManagement sub-group list, it seems that the UA design point for cookies is to share then between all open browser windows.  </s>
<s> That really does make it hard to manage a session.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> Isn't this rather self-defeating?  </s>
<s> This mechanism could then be used instead of the cookie.  </s>

<s> Users hate it because of _persistent_ cookies: Cookies that are requested to remain valid for literally YEARS.  </s>
<s> I routinely refuse *ANY* cookie that will not disappear when I shutdown the browser.  </s>
<s> You can solve the problem by giving the users the options to protect their privacy by allowing them to simply refuse persistent and third party cookies.  </s>
<s> To Netscape's credit they now have the option to silently turn off third party cookies.  </s>
<s> To Microsoft's discredit they still do not allow silent rejection of third party cookies and have implemented a mis-leading dialog that can result in people turning ON cookies by default when what they wanted to do was to turn them OFF silently.  </s>
<s> But the fundamental privacy invasion is cookie persistence since it allows profiles to be assembled over LONG periods of time without the informed consent of the user.  </s>
<s> UAs should be REQUIRED to provide ways for users to say 'never accept a persistent cookie' and 'never accept a third party cookie' with making the user get battered with 'Would you like to accept' dialogs.  </s>
<s> Better yet would be the ability to turn cookies permanently on or off on a site by site basis.  </s>
<s> I guess what I am trying to say is that cookie are easily abused in privacy violating ways while providing the users very little control.  </s>
<s> Add in NS's and Microsoft's public hostility to proposals for increasing user privacy and the creation of user paranoia about cookies is an obvious outcome.  </s>
<s> FYI: As an ISP we have blocked cookies in our HTTP proxies.  </s>
<s> I suspect more than a few other ISPs have also done this.  </s>
<s> This is really the ultimate response of ISPs to the browser makers' "we're not going to respect your users' privacy and you can't make us" attitude.  </s>
<s> We can _and have_ in effect removed *ALL* cookie functionality from their browsers.  </s>
<s> I could easily see European ISPs doing the same thing en mass to comply with Europe's personal data privacy laws.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't it be so much simpler for the browser makers' to simply do the _RIGHT_ thing and give users strong, detailed and informed control of cookies?  </s>
<s> A server (billionclick.com) different than the one currently | being browsed (myserver.com)  </s>
<s> has requested a cookie | (ssdflskdjfs=sdsdf) that will persist until 12 December, 2010.  </s>
<s> | The server states the following reason for the cookie request: | "This cookie is used for tracking advertising exposure of banner | advertisments and targeting banner ads to potential interest.  </s>
<s> | No personal identifying information is being accumulated nor | is the information being used in any other way."  </s>
<s> [More Info] | [x] Accept all future cookies from billionclick.com | [x] Allow cookies to persist after browser shutdown | [ ] Don't allow cookies to persist after browser shutdown | [ ] Ask for all future cookies from billionclick.com | [ ] Allow this cookie to persist after browser shutdown | [ ] Don't allow this cookie to persist after browser shutdown | [ ] Refuse all cookies from billionclick.com |  </s>

<s> Speaking only for myself, I don't like them because they're too often used only to track user behavior rather than provide me some service.  </s>
<s> In that case, I'd like to save cookies and replay them, only if my request URL can contain a small advertisement, ala' Yahoo, et al's pages.  </s>
<s> That way, I too can recover the cost of maintaining state for a _commercial_ entity, for _their_ benefit.  </s>
<s> Until then, I'll turn them off.  </s>
<s> Less state on both ends ought to make the processing response time faster, if nothing else.  </s>

<s> Yes, of course you're right, if it were per-cookie instead of per-server.  </s>
<s> If there were a generic "don't send cookies" command, that would not convey any state information.  </s>
<s> As Marc Hedlund pointed out, we don't need anything in the protocol for this at all -- the same UI mechanisms that would have to be built for that could entirely handle the problem.  </s>
<s> Sorry to waste time by bringing this up -- the dangers of "thinking out loud" in a group like this.  </s>
