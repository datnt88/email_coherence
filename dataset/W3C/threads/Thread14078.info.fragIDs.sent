<s> hi all, In case you missed the October 21 teleconference, or have not read the minutes [1], the people on the call determined that before our charter expires at the end of the month we need to: 1. Restructure the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> (please review [2]) 2. Add as many techniques to the techniques document as possible.  </s>
<s> 3. Close out as many open issues from the issues list as possible.  </s>
<s> 4. Plan for the next phase 5. Review and approve a new charter.  </s>
<s> We have a call scheduled for this Thursday at 4:00 Eastern on attendance may be low.  </s>
<s> I encourage lots of discussion on the list over the next few weeks.  </s>

<s> I am not sure I can attend on Thursday, if I can it will probably be late.  </s>
<s> But I think WAI needs to have some guidelines related to writing scripts.  </s>
<s> Is this something this working group is interested in addressing?  </s>
