Intalio's presentation is here: The MIND Lab presentation in powerpoint was a quick throw together because we couldn't run the full composition demo. 
Rather than include it, I would prefer people to go to which will take you to [1]. 
This page includes a link to examples of some web services marked up against the DAML-S model [2] and explicates a bit about what we are doing with them. 
If you have Java Web Start installed (and are either outside a firewall or somewhere where normal ssh tunneling works) you can run the demo (described near the bottom of the page) which will take you to [3]. 
(note that the demo downloads and runs a fairly complex java program, so it may take a bit before the window shows up on some machines) the interface isn't totally intuitive, but a little fooling around and you should be able to make it work - I expect a "how to" file to be there in the near future. 
If you compose a couple of services and then hit the "display workflow" button, you'll see what I need choreography for in this -- I'd like that to return an executable set of WS calls that would run the appropriate composed service in some way where it could be grounded on various different service types (WSDL, Grid, etc.) and, in an ideal world, relocatable to other groundings with little or no human intervention. 
-Jim Hendler p.s. If you hit the "run" button, the services will actually make appropriate calls to the web services via our server -- if this gets used to much, or abused, we may have to limit access to the demo - for now, however, we'll be trusting (naive) academics.
