I've updated the test to Java transform. 
The files are available at module in the CVS. 
I've tested the transform with one simple test and was able to generated code. 
However, I suspect that there are at least some production bugs.

I think that I updated dom-to-xsd.xsl 
(at least in the xmlconf CVS) to add id attributes to every element that didn't have them, but that shouldn't break existing tests. 
I also added ignoreComments 
as an implementation condition, I noticed that I had overlooked it as a JAXP switch, however it is such an odd-ball that maybe it should be dropped. 
I didn't rebuild dom1.xsd, however. 
An if construct (from memory, so I could be slight off) should look like: If the expected attribute is a string literal, it should be represented by containing a double quoted string inside a set of single quotes, that is (spaces added for emphasis): expected = ' "domestic" ' I haven't tested the code gen on this construct. 
I've just updated the test matrix to include ptr's to the xml file, and transformed java file for some of our tests. 
We've done domimplementation, node, document, namednodemap, characterdata, attr, element -- others will be forthcoming -- still checking them on this end. 
URL for test matrix is With respect to if, I get an 'unrecognized element if' -- either I'm missing something or it's not yet fully supported in the transform. 
If you have any ideas, let me know. 
You can view the xml file by looking at the xml link for nodecommentnodename ... --Mary
