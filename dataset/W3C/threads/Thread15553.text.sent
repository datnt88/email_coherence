Hello All - This combined with my earlier post related to accessibility and usability make up my action item from last weeks teleconference. 
At least this is a start. 
New examples start below proposed examples . 
Doyle Guideline 2.5 Help users avoid mistakes and make it easy to correct them. 
[level 2 guideline] Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.5 1. 
No level 1 success criteria for this guideline. 
Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.5 1. 
If a user error is detected, the error is identified and provided to the user in text 2. If a user error is detected, and suggestions for correction are known and can be provided without jeopardizing security or purpose (for example, test validity), they are provided (in an accessible form that meets Level 1 success criteria). 
3. 
Where consequences are significant and time-response is not important, one of the following is true: a. Actions are reversible. 
b. 
Where not reversible, actions are checked for errors before going on to the next step in the process. 
c. 
Where not reversible, and not checkable, the user is able to review and confirm or correct information before submitting it. 
Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.5 1. 
Where the input options are known, there are less than 75 of them, and they can be provided without jeopardizing security, test validity, etc, users are allowed to select from a list of options as well as to enter text directly. 
2. Checks for misspelled words are applied and correct spellings are suggested when text entry is required. 
Who Benefits from Guideline 2.5 (Informative) Identifying typing errors helps individuals with writing disabilities and people with dyslexia who often have difficulty writing text in forms or other places that need text input. 
Allowing users to select an option from a list instead of having to enter text directly helps individuals with speech disabilities because they might not be recognized properly in voice input applications. 
Examples of Guideline 2.5 (Informative) Example 1: a search engine. 
A search engine is provided with a variety of search options for different skill levels and preferences. 
It includes a spell checker and offers "best guess" alternatives, query-by-example searches, and similarity searches. 
Example 2: online form An airline web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. 
The user is asked to fill out a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address, phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. 
When the user submits the form with a form field not filled in, the user is notified there is an error but all correct information from the previous form stays unchanged. 
This prevents the user from having to re-enter all of the previous information. 
Example 3: online form (same form but a different scenario) An airline web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. 
The user is asked to fill out a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address, phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. 
If any of the fields of the form are either not filled out or filled out incorrectly, the user is warned of the input error. 
The user is now presented with the same form, all previously and correctly entered information is still available. 
The user is asked to make corrections to any form field marked with a red arrow or two asterisks ?**?. 
Note ? 
color alone is not used to indicate errors. 
Example 4: pull-down selections A web retailer offers online shopping for customers interested in fly fishing gear. 
When the user is asked for his/her country, a pull down list of countries is offered instead of having the user fill in the information by typing. 
To possibly make things easier, the user is informed that countries are listed in alphabetical order. 
Example 5: form submission confirmation A web user fills out an online form and submits the form by accidentally activating the web page submit button. 
A second resource appears and warns the user that the information as displayed will be sent once the final conformation is confirmed by using the final submit button. 
The web author has given users a second chance to confirm that all information is correct.

I have a few comments on the user error guidelines- thanks Doyle for doing the hard work! 
Gian Guideline 2.5 Help users avoid mistakes and make it easy to correct them. 
[level 2 guideline] - how about a level 1 success criteria is to provide a "Reset" button - so users can easily correct and mistakes Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.5 1. 
Where the input options are known, there are less than 75 of them, and they can be provided without jeopardizing security, test validity, etc, users are allowed to select from a list of options as well as to enter text directly. 
- Is 75 an arbitrary number? 
What about those fields that specify Country (such as: http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/) or very complex forms (such as: 1. 
If a user error is detected, the error is identified and provided to the user in text - does this success criteria allow this information to be provided via a dialog box - if so, what about accessibility concerns re popup windows etc? (such as: Do we want to allow this? 2. If a user error is detected, and suggestions for correction are known and can be provided without jeopardizing security or purpose (for example, test validity), they are provided (in an accessible form that meets Level 1 success criteria). 
Suggested rewrite: If a user error is detected, suggestions for correction are provided in an accessible manner, where: - valid entries are known - security is not jeopardised - purpose is not undermined Allowing users to select an option from a list instead of having to enter text directly helps individuals with speech disabilities because they might not be recognized properly in voice input applications. 
Also assists people with physical disabilities, dyslexia etc who may spell a word incorrectly. 
An airline web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. 
The user is asked to fill out a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address, phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. 
When the user submits the form with a form field not filled in, the user is notified there is an error but all correct information from the previous form stays unchanged. 
This prevents the user from having to re-enter all of the previous information. 
should we specify *how* the user is notified (ie with dialog box, text, HTML page etc) Example 3: online form (same form but a different scenario) An airline web site offers a special promotion on discounted flights. 
The user is asked to fill out a simple form that asks for personal information such as name, address, phone number, seating preference and e-mail address. 
If any of the fields of the form are either not filled out or filled out incorrectly, the user is warned of the input error.

I don't really understand the difference between this example and example 2. Example 4: pull-down selections A web retailer offers online shopping for customers interested in fly fishing gear. 
When the user is asked for his/her country, a pull down list of countries is offered instead of having the user fill in the information by typing. 
To possibly make things easier, the user is informed that countries are listed in alphabetical order. 
but this may invalidate the 75 input rule (see above) This could be at level 2, but not at level 1 because it would constrain the user interface, contrary to the definition of level 1. 
Level 1 could say something like: It must be possible for all input data to be cleared by the user agent, prior to the activation of an application function that processes the data. 
This isn't good wording. 
How to do better than arbitrary numbers while making the requirement precise? 
There will almost certainly be exceptions to whatever we specify here.  
snip What does "accessible manner" mean? 
Which other guidelines/success criteria apply here? 
Can we state it in terms of satisfying other guidelines/success criteria? 
snip Hi Gian and Group - I just went to Microsoft's site (http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide) and if I counted the countries correctly from the pull down menu, there were 76 countries listed. 
So, I am not sure where the number 75 came from - maybe a connection, I am not sure.

And it isn't good coding, either! 
It's already possible and it's already a bad idea. 
Reset buttons are simple to add via HTML, but can have annoying or severe consequences if you hit one by accident (as I have actually done). 
I can, however, see a use for a reset button for a dyslexic person or similar. 
However, it really needs to be backed up by a very clear error message saying "Are you really sure you want to destroy your laboriously-crafted data?"
