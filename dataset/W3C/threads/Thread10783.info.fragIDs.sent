<s> After reflection, I think we should keep external entities.  </s>
<s> FPIs and FSIs should be syntactically reserved, with pointers to the relevant SGML material as an explanation, but they themselves should not be part of XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> This _commits_ us to an XML 2.0.  </s>
<s> If such a commitment is not plausible, we should bite the bullet and put it all in now.  </s>

<s> After being quite silent for awhile, this is a statement I could agree with on external entities.  </s>
<s> Creating generic publishing systems for use over the web is going to demand more complex features.  </s>
<s> These features are not going to be trivial to solve and implement--but they will not be impossible either.  </s>
<s> At some point it time we are going to have to say: "We've done all the easy stuff, and its not enough to solve our problems."  </s>
<s> We should outline what we think should be in or considered in 2.0 if we are not allowing these things now.  </s>
<s> We don't want to go through the same discussion about character encodings, RS/RE, etc. again if we aren't going to change them in 2.0.  </s>
<s> We should have an additive process.  </s>

<s> I think the commitment to XML 2.0 is invitable if we want to stick to the schedule and get a revenue stream started to support the effort.  </s>
<s> The most serious mistake we can make is to treat this as an academic exercise and hope that freeware will appear from the universities.  </s>
<s> The WWW is a wheel in motion, going somewhere fast, and to influence that direction in any way at this late date, we must run alongside until we can get inside.  </s>
<s> So, it is not possible to consider 1.0 as a complete XML.  </s>
<s> It is a version designed to get products in the pipeline of framework handlers.  </s>
<s> Once a sustainable product line is established, it is possible to consider features that add power/complexity.  </s>
<s> Don't try to do it in a day.  </s>
<s> True, but if the bar is raised too high, too many jumpers fail on the first try and the sport is considered harmful or *only for the gifted*.  </s>
<s> True. Let's figure out what the problems are by experience.  </s>
<s> I agree, Alex, but I have the VRML 1.0/2.0 experience in mind as I watch this process.  </s>
<s> From a standing start, they got products in the pipeline less than three months after spec completion.  </s>
<s> They did not start fresh; they hacked Open Inventor ruthlessly, taking away features until they had an initial design that could be built quickly, would work in the Internet environment, could be supported by existing code (e.g, Renderware).  </s>
<s> In VRML 2.0, the same process was repeated.  </s>
<s> We knew we needed motion and extensibility.  </s>
<s> Frame interpolators were put in the language and protos (internal and external).  </s>
<s> In 2.0, the syntax was improved.  </s>
<s> To get this, SGI had to sign up to provide a reference implementation free and clear of encumbrance.  </s>
<s> I believe such requirements may be necessary for complex features one wants to add to XML.  </s>
<s> A script node is included, but no script language is required.  </s>
<s> An external interface is being outlined now.  </s>
<s> VRML 2.0 must be the last major shock to the syntax because too much software had to be rewritten.  </s>
<s> We might better that achievement, but 2.1 and up to 3.0 are considered improvements to capabilities such as the scripting and multi-user support.  </s>
<s> So, while I agree with what you are proposing, I expect that it will be hard without experience with 1.0 to precisely define the problems.  </s>
<s> We may want to do as the VRML community did, and provide a list of capabilities we want to have in place at each version level.  </s>
<s> Goals must ensure stability of product development.  </s>
<s> I also keep the HyTime experience in mind.  </s>
<s> IMO, it could have achieved more if we had spec'd a little, implemented a little, fielded a little, and spec'd a little more.  </s>
<s> It might have taken just as much time, but it would have had a product line and revenue stream in place when completed.  </s>
