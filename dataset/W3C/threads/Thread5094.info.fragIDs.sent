<s> Hi, This partly a marginally off-topic fyi, partly a more on-topic hunt for a code snippet.  </s>
<s> It's early days stuff, so any thoughts/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> I've been looking at applying essentially the same techniques as the rdf-in-xhtml proposal on a proposed extension mechanism for the Atom syndication language [1].  </s>
<s> Within Atom, the key part here is the link element, which will be used to point to external resources, e.g. link rel="comments" href="http://www.example.org/blog/entry1"  </s>
<s> type="text/html" There will be a set of standard values for rel [2], but the construct is ideal for extension using the ideas of RFC 2731 [3] (Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML).  </s>
<s> I made a start at writing this up at [4] (without reference to RDF for political reasons ;-), and Eric Scheid has begun turning this into a formal RFC (which will eventually contain the RDF mapping).  </s>
<s> Following the same path as rdf-in-xhtml, something of the form above should be transformable into RDF.  </s>
<s> e.g. the Atom source: link rel="FOAF.depiction"  </s>
<s> type="image/jpeg" href="http://rdfweb.org/vegemite.jpg" title="danbri with yeast extract" / would map (in part) to something like: rdf:RDF xmlns:atom="http://purl.org/atom xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf" ... (btw, a link rev="..." attribute has been proposed, which would reverse the role of the URIs in the statement).  </s>
<s> Ok, that's the fyi.  </s>
<s> Now the snippet-hunt.  </s>
<s> I'll put it in terms of atom:link, but I believe it would be essentially the same for xhtml:meta or whatever else is used in rdf-in-xhtml.  </s>
<s> Given that XSLT is a complete language, presumably it should be possible to do this transformation in a generic fashion on arbitrary namespaces and properties.  </s>
<s> So: = rdf:RDF ... xmlns:ns="http://example.org/namespace" (the id element is a little clunky, but that looks like the way it's going to be done in Atom)  </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone had a bit of code that did something like this -  </s>
<s> I'm only a novice with XSLT, so it would take me a good while to figure out.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>

<s> Hi Danny,  </s>
<s> I had a quick go and I think the attached stylesheet should do what you're asking.  </s>
<s> Also attached is the "atomish" xml document I tested it against (I'm not following the Atom syntax debates at all so I based it on your example).  </s>
<s> Ian  </s>
<s> Wow, that was quick.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> We are not worthy!! I'll get back on this after I've played with it a bit.  </s>
<s> I don't think there are any good examples of Atom using the extension - there's still a little controversy from the "Simple" brigade.  </s>
<s> But this should certainly help ;-) Cheers, Danny.  </s>
