Greetings. 
I am not a member of this mailing list, but would like to bring to the attention of whoever is concerned with such things that I have just viewed some Web pages I recently authored for the Boston area chapter of the Association for Internet Professionals (AIP) and am dismayed to find that, though they are rendered somewhat reasonably by both Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 on both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, they come out looking very strange using Amaya. 
I would like to write Web pages in a way that enables them to be viewed properly under the widest set of conditions possible, and I was looking forward to using Amaya itself for some authoring tasks. 
However, seeing what I am seeing makes me rather pessimistic that such a thing will be possible. 
For an example of what I mean, try viewing the home page of the site, which is at "http://boston.us.association.org/" - though the text in the main body of the page is rendered such that lines are filled to the ends of lines, as I have specified using an external style sheet, the margins I have specified in the style sheet are not being honored, as they are in both Netscape and IE. 
The banner at the top of the page, which is supposed to be displayed as a single unit, has spacing between each of the images, unlike what happens with either commercial browser. 
Likewise, the table at the bottom of the page comes out not being displayed in the neat fashion that it is under both Netscape and IE. (I am using the 1.2 version of Amaya under Windows for my tests.) If anyone can suggest a solution for these problems or would like more information, please contact me by e-mail ("gtrujillo@association.org") or phone (617-776-0121). 
Thanks very much, in advance, for any help you might be able to provide. 
Also, I would like to invite anyone who might be interested to attend the AIP meeting this evening at MIT (select the "meetings" link from the AIP page cited above for details). 
Also, I would be interested in the possibility of someone who is familiar with the work of the W3C being a speaker for the organization, which meets monthly at MIT. Best regards, Gary Trujillo 
... I would like to write Web pages in a way that enables them to be viewed properly under the widest set of conditions possible, Yes! Excellent goal. 
http://boston.us.association.org/ is better than most. 
I just took a look at the page using GNU Emacs W3 mode, Mosaic with 
images turned off, Netscape 4, and Amaya 1.2. 
I use Emacs for serious work, Mosaic for speed, Netscape for seeing what some others see, and Amaya (and sometimes Arena) to ensure compatibility. 
You are right, Amaya is not following the stylesheet as you might expect for a browser with graphics turned on and no other overriding stylesheets. 
Doubtless, the Amaya people will fix this eventually. 
In the meantime, it is best to consider Amaya as just another way your page will be presented. 
After all, writing Web pages is rather like `herding cats'. 
You can suggest to the cats they come for a walk (mine usually do) but the choice is ultimately their's and they know it. 
Web pages are written in HTML, which is a formatting language that provides hints towards layout, but leaves choice to the reader. 
Plan your presentation so it not only looks good for Netscape and Amaya, but also looks good to people who efficiently employ one or other text-primary browser. 
Write so your page `hears good' to a blind person using a speech synthesizer. 
This way you reach towards the "widest set of conditions possible". 
For example, the `alt' text for the banners at the top of the page could be reworked. 
Most of the rest is OK. 
As i said, you are fairly close to having a decent page. 
... I have specified using an external style sheet ... Bear in mind that browsers can overrule an external style sheet. 
You page should look or hear well when the reader uses his own. 
For example, with Emacspeak, a text to speech converter, the browser will end up using a stylesheet that has parts like this: li,dt,dd { pitch: 6; richness: 6; } a:link { voice-family: harry; } a:visited { voice-family: betty;} a:active { voice-family: betty; pitch-range: 8; pitch: 8 } See Blind Access to the Net /a and Emacspeak /a as well as: The `Best Viewed With Any Browser' site /a You say: ... I was looking forward to using Amaya itself for some authoring tasks. 
However, seeing what I am seeing makes me rather pessimistic that such a thing will be possible. 
Hmmm.... I think you are looking at Web page design as if it were like design for a printed page, rather than `herding cats' as I mentioned above. 
That is, unconsciously or consciously, you hope to see what you plan for. 
This is the way email works as well as print on paper. 
But HTML composition is different; it consists of providing hints to various quite different browsers. 
I have tried Amaya; it is not that bad for composing; it appears to generate reasonable HTML. 
(It is actually easier and more productive to write HTML source directly using Emacs HTML Helper mode, but that is a different issue.) Best wishes Robert J. Chassell bob@rattlesnake.com

Hi Gary, I agree that CSS implementation in Amaya is not perfect yet. 
We are now working on it and I hope that new release will fix all mentioned problems.
