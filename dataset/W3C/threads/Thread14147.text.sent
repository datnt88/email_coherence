Hello, Some of you may get this twice - those of you who have previously participated in the math and science discussions. 
If you are able, a response by the end of the day would be appreciated. 
From my tests, most of the character entities defined in HTML4 for math symbols were NOT supported by Communicator 4 and Explorer 4. Thus, is the following technique valid? 
2. Do not use to "generate" mathematical symbols. 
Use HTML character entities (or numerical reference) instead. 
(FONT face should be used only for suggesting style) For example: a to generate the Greek lower case alpha. 
this is incorrect as a conforming browser should render the Latin letter lower case a in this case. 
Follows is part of the source file that I tested - the character entity information is taken from the HTML4 Rec.. In communicator I get question marks, in Explorer I get boxes. 
If you are able to produce something else, please let me know what I have missed. 
I don't see that "symbol" is a valid attribute of "face" but I tried it anyway, just for grins. 
Using FONT face for the whole doc produces interesting results Also note that the *only* character entities that are recognized are the last two (for division). 
It seems that everything included in the list of "Character entity references for ISO 8859-1 characters" is supported by both. 
However, note that very few in this ISO list are related to math. 
-- greek capital letter alpha, U+0391 -- greek capital letter beta, U+0392 -- greek capital letter gamma, U+0393 ISOgrk3 -- greek capital letter delta, U+0394 ISOgrk3 -- greek capital letter epsilon, U+0395 -- greek capital letter zeta, U+0396 -- greek capital letter eta, U+0397 -- greek capital letter theta, U+0398 ISOgrk3 -- greek capital letter iota, U+0399 -- greek capital letter kappa, U+039A -- greek capital letter lambda, U+039B ISOgrk3 -- greek capital letter mu, U+039C -- greek capital letter nu, U+039D -- greek capital letter xi, U+039E ISOgrk3 -- greek capital letter omicron, U+039F -- greek capital letter pi, U+03A0 ISOgrk3 ! 
-- greek capital letter rho, U+03A1 -- for all, U+2200 ISOtech -- partial differential, U+2202 ISOtech -- there exists, U+2203 ISOtech -- empty set = null set = diameter, U+2205 ISOamso -- nabla = backward difference, U+2207 ISOtech -- element of, U+2208 ISOtech -- not an element of, U+2209 ISOtech -- contains as member, U+220B ISOtech -- n-ary product = product sign, U+220F ISOamsb &amp;divide; is a more convenient form than w My experience with Netscape4.51 is that is displays correctly a great deal of math symbols if 1. they are marked with decimal references I have heard rumors to this effect for other 4.x versions. 
Internet explorer 5 does support (most) math symbols, both decimal and hexadecimal, and also name entities, but with name entities less symbols are supported. 
Lynx 2.8.1 supports *all* math symbols in *all* the different ways you can think of. 
This browser, however does not "support" the FONT face bug. 
My expreince in with Windows95. 
A possible modification of the guidelines is to use images with alt text according to HTML4.0, this way both Lynx and old, buggy, and non-standard graphical browsers will display correctly. 
The FONT face thing is not valid HTML because it attempts to add new characters with a mechanism intended to suggest apearance of characters.

This is also my conclusion. 
All versions of Netscape are severely broken in this area, as they seem to behave as if the character repertoire is pretty much limited to the repertoire defined by the value of the "charset", and furthermore they don't seem to have implemented the character entity names. 
On the other hand, displaying something like &amp;gamma; unparsed, even if it isn't very attractive, is more functionally useful than displaying the wrong character (which happens on some HTML3.2-conforming browser versions, because they take the numerical value modulo 256), or an empty box. 
Indeed. 
I recommend (for these kind of situations*) to compose the HTML using only US-ASCII characters, and to represent other characters by either their entity names (for Latin-1 only) or their numerical character references. 
If the result is advertised as UTF-8 then it is entirely valid (albeit it provokes one minor bug in MSIE4, see Netscape manages to display it. 
*)I mean, obviously this wouldn't be an attractive way to compose a page that was primarily in Cyrillic, Japanese or whatever. 
But if the page is primarily in a Latin alphabet, it's OK. 
That's kind of poetic. 
One could also supply some heavyweight javascript to tell the graphical browsers how to correct their bugs, while Lynx calmly displayed the standard HTML correctly. 
I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from this about accessibility guidelines; I'm just trying to contribute my observations from trying to make this stuff work at all, in the available browsers. 
Jukka Korpela has some interesting pages on the topic (start at the URL that I cited), and is kind enough to link also to my own at Best regards
