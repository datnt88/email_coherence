Dear Sirs, To be short, let me be brief. 
Where is my dashes? 
Netscape Editor (from Netscape Navigator Version 3.0 Gold package) converts my "&amp;mdash;" into "&amp;amp;mdash;". 
How can Tidy be programmed to correct this substitution if any? 
Where is my named entity references? 
It seems that the same Netscape Editor translates a good deal of my named entities into text. 
E. g. "&amp;radic;" - "&amp;amp;radic;". 
How Tidy could help me to fix this problem if any? 
Where is my 'border="0"' attribute?! So, could Tidy be programmed to insert 'border="0"' attribute into table " tag when or where this attribute is omitted. 
It is because of the same Netscape Editor again. 
The Editor eats 'border="0"' attributes (with value "0"). 
From http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ : "Tidy supports a small set of character encoding options. 
The default is ASCII, which makes it easy to edit markup in regular text editors." 
So, Tidy will not convert Windows cp1251 and Windows cp1253 pages into UTF-8 pages in future? 
Isn't it a bug below? 
HTML sample: form method="post" action="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary" 
On the HTML from above, Tidy reports the following: line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing td line 3 column 21 - Warning: discarding unexpected td line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing /form before /td line 9 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected /form This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
Or another sample: form method="post" action="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/thesaurus" 
Tidy's report is following: line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing td line 3 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected td line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing /form before /td line 9 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected /form This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
You may ask me why I insert here form tag before td tag and don't do that after td tag. 
Well, I explain it with pleasure :). 
I just have downloaded this or similar code from the address "http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/srchbox5.zip" which was linked from "http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/searchboxes2.htm". 
And, in addition, a description could be found on "http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/searchboxes3.htm". 
Best regards, Cyril, Esq. 
Tidy has no way of knowing if &amp;amp;mdash; is an editor bug or what the user actually wanted. 
Also, stylesheets and other things could be effecting table borders, so assuming border="0" when it's not specified could easily mess things up. 
In short, I can't see any of that being put into tidy. 
Luckily it sounds like those are bugs in Netscape 3. If possible, try upgrading to Mozilla - it's Netscape without the corporate crappyness.

Err woops. 
Mind was on something else when i wrote that. 
border="0" - tidy removes this because 0 is the default value for border. 
it's not needed, so why put it in? 
The fact that someone else also does it wrong, doesn't mean you have to. 
It is a gross violation of the HTML standard. 
If you either put the complete form inside one table cell, or wrap the FORM and /FORM tags around a table and put the form controls in table cells, everything will be fine, and the search will work just as good (if not better) in all browsers.

M * Rijk van Geijtenbeek [Mon, 09/02/2004 at 10:03 +0100] I am afraid that more than 90% of the HTML found on the web is more a sort of tag soup than real HTML. 
I would suggest that you use an HTML aware editor, such as one of the Emacses (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html or http://www.xemacs.org/)or 
HTML-Kit (http://www.chami.com/html-kit/).
