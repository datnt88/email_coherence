Matthew Fuchs asks, in regards to a digital signature, "How we know just what the signature covers"? 
In other words, what is the scope of the digital signature? 
The digital signature people are working on this question, and have some good ideas. 
From what I can see, this is an issue of the semantics of digital signatures, but not an XML problem. 
We don't need to solve it for them, merely give them the basic tools from which they can construct a solution. 
(Those tools being a way to put an unambiguous, structured digital signature element in or on any element.)

I believe Mathew's real question to be what does this mean: In the SGML world we have a mechanism for making that impossible so that the author and the programmer can know what each other is thinking about. 
When these database people talk about throwing away validation they are really talking about throwing away this contract of data consistency. 
Paul Prescod 
Oh. I agree that we don't want to preclude validation. 
Just that validation and namespaces are separate issues. 
--Andrew Layman AndrewL@microsoft.com 
As part of my review of namespace blather I came upon this anti-gem. 
Since validation is not possible in the presence of arbitrary included markup unless that markup is part of a DTD, the GI-hacking namespace proposals are all intimately related to the question of validation. 
Wishing will not make the problem go away, so we need to address it if we adopt any such proposal. 
If architectural forms meet the need, of course, these are all non-questions, or at best, possible improvements for some future xml 2.0 or 1.1 or whatever.
