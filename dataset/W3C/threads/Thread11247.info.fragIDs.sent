<s> Matthew Fuchs asks, in regards to a digital signature, "How we know just what the signature covers"?  </s>
<s> In other words, what is the scope of the digital signature?  </s>
<s> The digital signature people are working on this question, and have some good ideas.  </s>
<s> From what I can see, this is an issue of the semantics of digital signatures, but not an XML problem.  </s>
<s> We don't need to solve it for them, merely give them the basic tools from which they can construct a solution.  </s>
<s> (Those tools being a way to put an unambiguous, structured digital signature element in or on any element.)  </s>

<s> I believe Mathew's real question to be what does this mean: In the SGML world we have a mechanism for making that impossible so that the author and the programmer can know what each other is thinking about.  </s>
<s> When these database people talk about throwing away validation they are really talking about throwing away this contract of data consistency.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Oh. I agree that we don't want to preclude validation.  </s>
<s> Just that validation and namespaces are separate issues.  </s>
<s> --Andrew Layman AndrewL@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> As part of my review of namespace blather I came upon this anti-gem.  </s>
<s> Since validation is not possible in the presence of arbitrary included markup unless that markup is part of a DTD, the GI-hacking namespace proposals are all intimately related to the question of validation.  </s>
<s> Wishing will not make the problem go away, so we need to address it if we adopt any such proposal.  </s>
<s> If architectural forms meet the need, of course, these are all non-questions, or at best, possible improvements for some future xml 2.0 or 1.1 or whatever.  </s>
