<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Please try to download again Amaya.  </s>
<s> The problem you've had is independent of the release we did.  </s>
<s> You did not include any Amaya download for Windows 98?  </s>
<s> You did include Windows NT and Windows 95.  </s>
<s> I assume Windows 95 also applies to Windows 98. Right?qbd  </s>
<s> The binaries for Win95 should work on Win98.  </s>
