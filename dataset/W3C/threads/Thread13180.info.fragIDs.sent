<s> 3. Brainstorm on accessibility of pages with Javascript.  </s>
<s> What's most important to check for?  </s>
<s> 4. Grouping of elements on web pages.  </s>
<s> This started out with a discussion of the MAP element.  </s>
<s> I turns out that, indeed, the HTML 4 folks had intended it to group links.  </s>
<s> The editor will be clarifying the language in a future update.  </s>
<s> However, this still leaves open the question: what if there are other types of grouping?  </s>
<s> e.g. blocks of HTML that are "new", or "example", or "deprecated", or "sale" etc.  </s>
<s> The author may define a class... e.g. class="new", class="example" etc. and link visual and auditory styles to that class.  </s>
<s> Would it also be useful to inform the user in a logical way?  </s>
<s> E.g. by having a text string that the user could access...a text string that would not necessarily match the internal class name.  </s>
<s> And would it be useful for the user to search the document for that class.  </s>
<s> (As you might guess, my personal opinion is "yes").  </s>
