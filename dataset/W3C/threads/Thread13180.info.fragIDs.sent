Our next telconference is Monday, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910) Agenda: 1. Update on action items from last call Action WL Start the basis of "What are the accessibility features of RDF" Action WC: Check out schematron, how can we make it more precise? 
Action LK post links to ASSETS and CUU Action WC ask JB who she knows in the area that might be able to host. 
Action LK post link to XML 2000 to the list. 
2. Meeting Due to other w3 activity, our tentative face to face meeting will be just before XML 2000 http://www.gca.org/attend/2000_conferences/XML_2000/ 
Dec 3-8 Washington DC Reactions? 
3. Brainstorm on accessibility of pages with Javascript. 
What's most important to check for? 
4. Grouping of elements on web pages. 
This started out with a discussion of the MAP element. 
I turns out that, indeed, the HTML 4 folks had intended it to group links. 
The editor will be clarifying the language in a future update. 
However, this still leaves open the question: what if there are other types of grouping? 
e.g. blocks of HTML that are "new", or "example", or "deprecated", or "sale" etc. 
The author may define a class... e.g. class="new", class="example" etc. and link visual and auditory styles to that class. 
Would it also be useful to inform the user in a logical way? 
E.g. by having a text string that the user could access...a text string that would not necessarily match the internal class name. 
And would it be useful for the user to search the document for that class. 
(As you might guess, my personal opinion is "yes").

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
The SVG access note at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access provides some explanationm of how to use RDFD for improving the accessibility of SVG (or any other image for that matter. 
There is a Note on how to include RDF in JPEGs at http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf and there is a piece of software that does it - http://jigsaw.w3.org/rdfpic - available as open source. 
There is a javascript dummy toy at javascript interpreter to look for tools that conform to ATAG, but the schema used is designed to work for anyof the WAI guidelines (or anything else that has a URI for something taht can be conformed to - for example the namespace URI for an XML application would work fine.
