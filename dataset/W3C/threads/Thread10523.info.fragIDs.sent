Due to underwhelming response to call for agenda items I am shortening tommorrow's agenda to 90 minutes.

We didn't have enough attendees to hold a full WG meeting. 
Those of us who were around talked for a while, IRC notes from which are at Actions from last week are all carried forward. 
Jeremy expects to have last week's minutes for us early next week.
