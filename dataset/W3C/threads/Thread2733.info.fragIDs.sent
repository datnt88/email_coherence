<s> On Fri 3/13/98 5:28 PM, the 'last LAST CALL' for three documents (v11-spec-rev, authentication, state-man-mec) was issued, and scheduled to expire March 27.  </s>
<s> We've since had several relatively minor issues raised with the first document (v11-spec-rev), but, more importantly, we're still looking for more complete implementation reports of a few features before forwarding this document on as Draft Standard.  </s>
<s> The second document (authentication) has had substantial comments, which I believe will require a revision and another (brief) last  </s>
<s> call.  </s>
<s> More importantly, we need better substantiation of testing of interoperability of the independent implementations.  </s>
<s> We're still hoping for Draft Standard status for these two documents together, since v11-spec-rev should not move forward without a credible authentication mechanism at the same maturity level.  </s>
<s> The last document (state-man-mec) has had no substantial comments, except that there are not independent interoperable implementations, and it seems possible that we just forward it on as Proposed Standard, which I will do forthwith.  </s>

<s> The previous "last call" was pretty sudden.  </s>
<s> One thing that I don't like is nc-value = 8LHEX It should be nc-value = *LHEX  </s>
<s> Also in Authentication-Info I think it should be auth-info = 1#( [nextnonce] | [ message-qop ]  </s>
<s> [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ] [nonce-count] )  </s>
<s> instead of auth-info = 1#(nextnonce | [ message-qop ]  </s>
<s> [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ] [nonce-count] )  </s>
<s> with [] around nextnonce indicating that it is optional.  </s>

<s> I was the one that specified the fixed size (implying leading zeros) originally (though I think that I used 4 rather than 8); my thinking was that it would avoid any potential problems with one side using the leading zeros and the other not.  </s>
<s> I can live with it either way.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> How about doing what is done for the chunked TE and using lhex-no-zero = LHEX excluding "0" nc-value = lhex-no-zero *LHEX to forbid the leading zeros.  </s>
<s> I think that at least 99% of the time the nc-value will be a single digit.  </s>
<s> It is kind of wasteful and silly to require an enormous number of nc=00000001 fields.  </s>
<s> I suppose for backwards compatibility we should as servers to tolerate the leading zeros.  </s>
