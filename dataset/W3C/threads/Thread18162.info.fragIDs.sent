Comments in response to the last call request for comments have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale: S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is self contradictory, etc. S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc. E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.  </s>

<s> That was not my understanding.  </s>
<s> At our 26 September teleconf [1], we resolved to: 1. Make lists of important elements informative 2. Make minimal navigation requirements forward and backward 3. Use same configuration for important elements 7.6 and 8.4 4. Talk about Al's and others functional requirements for identifying important elements (element type and number of resulting navigable elements) I commented that "8.4 and 7.6 are separated for a reason.  </s>
<s> The two are not inherently bound."  </s>
<s> One reason: an outline may benefit people even if it's not navigable.  </s>
<s> Thus, a table of contents in a paperback book is useful, but not navigable directly.  </s>
<s> So my understanding is that the language you refer to is not legacy but is still there intentionally.  </s>
<s> I thought that we had decided that: - One requirement was for navigation of important elements.  </s>
<s> - One requirement was for an outline built of important elements.  </s>
<s> - The set of important elements was the same for both cases.  </s>
<s> For this reason, the requirement to be able to configure the set could be shared by both checkpoints.  </s>

<s> AG:: We are not communicating.? I am not claiming that we decided anything other than the third point you just reiterated above.? So at least on that we seem to have the same recollection.  </s>
<s> I do, however, claim that in the light of this decision, the "not required to be navigable" language is misleading enough so that we should change it.? It is not enough, once one has said that, to have a bland "see also checkpoint 7.7" at the end of the paragraph.  </s>
<s> Navigation of the points listed in the 8.4 outline summary does not have to be provided by virtual-hypertext clickability, but those have to be navigable points if 7.6 and 7.7 are satisfied.? So, the way I would describe it, this outline _does_ have to be navigable if 7.6 is satisfied, Precisely _how_ one navigates to the points 8.4 orients you to is implementation defined.? I would be quite happy if it were modified to say "Although this checkpoint per_se does not require that this outline is navigable, checkpoint 7.7 does require that if there is structural navigation provided to meet checkpoint 7.6, that that structural navigation will get you to the points in the document presented in the checkpoint 8.4 orientation to page structure."  </s>
