<s> The August 7 Tidy does the following desc += " /td /table "; with the warning line 7 column 16 - Warning: ' ' + '/' + letter not allowed here and writes out ie desc += " \/td \/table "; Because of course it does not detect eg the td , formally its correct, but in practice of course the td is written out elsewhere.  </s>

<s> If you have then the script *must* be taken as ending just before /foo , and then the parser will discover that /foo isn't actually allowed them.  </s>

<s> For XHTML, I am looking into ways to hide a CDATA marked section in the script element, e.g. // ![CDATA[ ... some javascript ... //]] A similar approach is applicable to CSS.  </s>
<s> This solves the pressing problem of making the documents wellformed, but leaves open the Turing-complete issue of document.write  </s>
<s> and direct use of the DOM to generate markup programmatically.  </s>
<s> The HTML working group wisely ducked the issue, leaving it up to authors to deal with!  </s>
<s> Of course the Web is increasingly about scripting rather than static documents.  </s>
<s> XML Schema doesn't even begin to tackle the problem of documents with dynamic constraints.  </s>
