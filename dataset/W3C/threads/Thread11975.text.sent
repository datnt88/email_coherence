I would like to do them weekly, so we can cover things a bit faster, and get a better turnaround time on IG reviews etc. 
I think Wednesday is probably better than Monday, since there are a number of holidays that happen on Mondays and it is a good day to keep free anyway (so we can all take long weekends, go to the beach, and think about Authoring Tools - grin) So I would suggest 3.30pm to 4.30pm, or 4pm to 5pm (Boston times) on Wednesdays. 
(I also know that Ian has freed up that time, and it would be good if he could make the calls.) Charles --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org
