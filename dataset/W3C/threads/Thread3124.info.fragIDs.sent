Hi guys, Dave B says why don't we put the deliverables and the schemas for WP8 under a CVS server we can all access. 
I say fine, what do we have to do to make this happen?

couple of options: 1) danbri/other sorts you out with permissions &amp; connection details for w3c cvs server - (you need to generate public/private key pair and give dan your public key etc. 
Then you check the files in a suitable directory (e.g. see http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/) 2) I or Dave, who have access to the cvs server, can check the files in for you. 
Am happy to do this, but you might prefer 1) because you get control over what goes where on an ongoing basis, let me know if you need any help, Nikki --On Wednesday, February 04, 2004 16:29:26 +0000 "Miles, AJ (Alistair) "

[how to get the thing onto the W3C CVS server] And just to tidy up, please don't forget to put HTTP redirects at the original places so the URIs don't die... cheers Chaals
