The interface to an Element allows one to change the value of an Attribute: void setAttribute(String name, String value) throws DOMException ... It is my understanding that Attributes are typed, but the above interface does not throw a DOMException if the type of the 'value' parameter is not the type allowed for the attribute matching the 'name' parameter. 
Please illuminate. 
Thanks.

Validating changes to Attributes requires more of the DocumentType than has been implemented in Level 1 of the DOM. 
Presumably Level 2 will address this, but for now the DOM does not attempt to confirm that the new attribute value matches the DTD. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author. 
More generally the DOM Level 1 doesn't include any type of document validation mechanism.
