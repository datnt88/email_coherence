Hi, There's no way i could find except to use DHTML to differentiate between disabled and enabled buttons in a form. 
Is there a way wherein i dont have to use DHTML? 
Regards Tarun In article 041401c1f034$009d50c0$e10fe39d@WISPER , Set the disabled attribute - seems to work for me! 
kh City Desk Waikato University [PGP key available if desired] Hi Amaya Family In what document type the figure should be drawn i.e in svg or html? 
It could be a stand-alone SVG document or within a svg element in a HTML document. 
I drew in html type and when I tried to take print then Amaya misaligned all the objects. 
Same happened when I took posscript print. 
If you want to control the position of your SVG elements, these elements must be children of the same svg elements. 
When I drew the same figure in svg type then it didn't print the figure and gave garbage at the prompt. 
Also nothing is printed in postscript form in this case. 
Could send us an example? 
And what is your platform? 
Oftenely when I draw lines then Amaya does not adjust its second coordinates. 
In the source file when I put the "y" coordinate of the 2nd coordinates then the line is well adjusted. 
Kindly guide me where I am making the mistakes! 
When a bug is fixed or any change in Amaya is informed over the group mail, then we have to download Amaya from w3.org again for reinstallation or these changes are integerated in the Next coming version? 
The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/ChangeLog.html lists new features and bugs fixes in the CVS version. 
Obviously these new things are included in the next public release. 
Irene.
