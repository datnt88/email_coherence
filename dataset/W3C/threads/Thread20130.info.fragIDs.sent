<s> Hi, is there any possibility to prevent that amaya expands relative paths in hrefs when copying and pasting from one document to another?  </s>
<s> If you have a local copy of your homepage and you use relative paths you have to be very careful when copying and pasting because amaya expands all relative pathnames to absolute ones.  </s>
<s> In my case this is bad because my hard drive is not available from the internet :-) Maybe there is an option I missed?  </s>
<s> I think in most cases this path extension is not good.  </s>
<s> Other comments?  </s>

<s> Amaya tries to generate relative paths as often as possible.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't it could be due to an existing base element in the document (check the head in the structure view) or the fact that you are editing some pages as local files and others as through the server.  </s>
<s> If you are in the later case, you have to choose either to edit all pages as local pages or to edit through the server.  </s>
<s> That needs to install the PUT (a script is provided, see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/put.html).  </s>
<s> All the W3C team uses Amaya to publish directly on the http://www.w3.org server.  </s>

<s> There are times when it is really useful - most of the time I am copying linnks from other pages somewhere on the web and am very happy that the URIs are maintained to point to the same place.  </s>
<s> At other times when it is a real problem.  </s>
<s> It would be best if it could be toggled somewhere, and if we could put a button on the button-bar that reflected the state that would be good too.  </s>
<s> I don't know if that works though - I think the button bar is read at initialisation and then can't be changed... Charles McCN In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 20 Jul 1999 15:22:34 +0200."  </s>

<s> Ok. All editing is done "locally" on our server.  </s>
<s> Let's give an example.  </s>
<s> The homepage is at d:\www I copy a part from a page at d:\www\Presse\index.html with href=../Bullet.gif if I paste that image to a page at d:\www\test.html it's correctly resolved to href=Bullet.gif but if I paste it to a page at d:\www\Files\index.html it is resolved to d:\www\Bullet.gif which is wrong and dangerous, because it only works internally.  </s>
<s> Nothing is posted directly to www.derago.com because we currently only have a dial up connection to the web.  </s>
<s> So because our whole page is maintained with Amaya we have to check daily if there is d:\www anywhere on our page.  </s>
