I am a new user of Tidy and have used it to "tidy"-up WEB page output from Access 2000. 
I am getting some errors that I can't resolve (maybe because I don't understand what Access 2000 is trying to do in the generated HTML/XML) Has anyone done this before? 
Can anyone point me in the right direction as far a any special params that must be set? 
TIA Gary J. Piccoli Colonial Computer Associates Home of "MuSoft 2000" Since I don't have Access 2000 installed, it would be a good idea to provide a sample document for further analysis.

I would just like to comment that I remember that even with all the bells and whistles turned on, I remember that I still couldn't get tidy to turn the usual mircosoft html mess document into a html strict 4.01 with _no stylesheet_ and all the font stuff somehow rationalized into em , strong etc. 
[if really necessary and not just "flagrant font flipping"]. 
Bjoern: I have attached the HTML output from Access 2000 for a simple file maintenance page. 
I turned on all the XML options for my Tidy test. 
I get my first error on line 13. 
Let me know what you think.

The problem is the attribute which Microsoft Access uses to store an XML fragment, this contains a large number of  and  characters, which makes tidy assume there is a missing double quote in an attribute. 
About the shortest possible test case is PARAM NAME="XMLData" VALUE=" xml xmlns:a=urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:access &amp;#13;&amp;#10; I have uploaded a Bug report and test case 500236 for this, the fix should be a simple change to the heuristics in lexer.c. 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Horrors! 
I feel your pain (and Tidy's, too). 
:) Interesting that Tidy also warns here about "xmlns:..." attributes being "unknown"; these days and times, is that a good idea? 
Xmlns is unknown to HTML 4, but ... As to the error, "missing quote mark for attribute value", I'm not sure what it's thinking here. 
I manually quoted the unquoted attribute values, and it still said that. 
/Jelks This fixes the problem: diff -r1.57 lexer.c 
3089c3089,3091 javascript URL scheme which may legitimately include  and  , and for attributes starting with " xml " as generated by Microsoft Office.
