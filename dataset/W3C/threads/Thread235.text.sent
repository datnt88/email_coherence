As the popularity of CodeCranker grows and the number of links increases it becomes more important to make sure your site is getting the exposure in our list that it deserves. 
We've addressed this by putting in place a rating system that allows your users to rate the quality and content of your site. 
This in turn is used to sort the links in each category. 
We also find the highest rated links and feature them every week in a Site of the week (for each category) and a top rated resource page that is updated every day. 
All you have to do to participate in this system is to place the following snippet of HTML on your site. 
As a programmer who hates spam myself I want to make sure that you only receive this kind of e-mail if you want it. 
If you no longer want to receive e-mail from the CodeCranker simply reply to this message with an Un-Subscribe in the subject and we'll remove your name immediately (this won't in any way effect your link entry with us) Then surely you realize that it is highly improper to use another's mailing list as a destination for spam. 
Would every subscriber to the list have to send a remove request before you'd remove the list from your spam list? 
At most you can _ask_ _once_ for people to opt-in to your list, but not unilaterally decide for people that they are interested in your mailings. 
And learn the difference between "affect" and "effect" please. 
You come across as a fool when you get them mixed up. 
Back to the list topic, I have looked over the latest HTML Tidy changes and expect to send additional bugfixes tomorrow. 
Here's a few I can recall from the top of my head: search for "Framset" and "xhtml1l". 
There are also omitted slashes at the end of some URLs in that same source document. 
(I'm sorry, I can't recall which one.) There's also a function which can corrupt the node list such that this expression evaluates as true: (node- content- prev- parent == node) Again, I can't recall which one, but when I can run a diff again I'll have it for you. 
I also see there is not yet HTML 4.01 support in HTML Tidy. 
I think I've got it done in my copy except that it still can't distinguish HTML 4.0 from HTML 4.01. 
All these I expect to mail to the list the evening of the 29th.

I find it ironic that the guy didn't run Tidy on his HTML before posting it here.
