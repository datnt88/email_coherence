Are there any HTTP/1.1 servers which support the deflate method? 
I think I have a correct (modulo bugs) client implementation of deflate in the current (alpha) version of E-scape, and I'd like to test it sometime before I release 1.0. the You can do most of your testing simply by adding the "deflate" content encoding on a file - the server doesn't have to deflate it on the fly. 
Jigsaw supports this by editing the resource directly and Apache by the AddEncoding configuration directive. 
This is what we did when we did the work on compression in the paper "Network Performance Effects of HTTP/1.1, CSS1, and PNG" which is available from In addition to this we have also done some testing on how HTML case-canonicalization affects compression. 
You can find the study at tml It shows that lower case HTML tags is better than uppercase and that mixed casing gives the worst result. 
You can also find a simple "deflater" tool here. 
Also, we have done some testing on how compression tends to have a good effect on TCP slow start and delayed acknowledgement. 
You can find this note at As you might have guessed from the URLs above - we keep a performance overview at Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, frystyk@w3.org

Joel, I've got a cgi that will produce content-encoding headers for gzip and deflate that uses our own rfc 1951 (1950&amp;1952) implementation.. I'd love it if you'd test it for interop with your browser.. and let me know how it goes.. -P
