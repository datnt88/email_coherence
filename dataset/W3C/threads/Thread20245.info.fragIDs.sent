<s> after wrestling with your sources for a few hours, i finally managed to make it compile.  </s>
<s> all through the compilation i was expecting the thing to segfault in the end, and of course it did, thanks for wasting my time and lastly, i should kick myself for even giving you a chance, given that i saw the words "style sheets" and HTML 4.0 and X-fill-in-your-favorite-information-overload-architechture you know why nobody in their right mind uses style sheets or CVS or automake?  </s>
<s> well, because all these things are designed to make life more complicated, and frankly there are still a few of us left that prefer to make life easier for ourselves, after all, that's what these machines were supposed to do in the first place, they're not there to create work for its own sake, or to give snobs computer jargon with witch they can discriminate others.  </s>
<s> i don't know why i'm writing this to you, perhaps in retaliation for wasting my time.  </s>
<s> i'm sure you'll read over this, understand it, and promply block it out of your mind, because you're too far along in your psychosis to turn back now, but what the hell, i gave it a try.  </s>
<s> If you'd rather have your web pages look like they were printed out on a teletype out of some misbegotten nostalgia, by all means, don't use CSS or HTML 4. Get out your Rainbow and hack a CP/M port of Lynx together, there should still be some 300 Baud modems out there at yard sales.*  </s>

<s> It is, however, intended to address various points and opinions that have come-up in this particular discussion thread.]  </s>
<s> Okay, now we've countered extremity with extremity.  </s>
<s> Let's try for a little perspective, shall we?  </s>
<s> While I don't encounter much of a problem with HTML4, I don't use CSS much currently, because of the problems I've encountered with cross-platform compatibility and accessibility concerns.  </s>
<s> Until differing browsers handle CSS similarly, I tend to avoid it.  </s>
<s> If you don't, good on you.  </s>
<s> My coding needs and user base may be very different from yours.  </s>
<s> As to Lynx and 300 bps modems: While 300bps is overkill (underkill?), it's easy to forget that Lynx is still widely used (I use it frequently on my Linux box, when I want quick information and don't care about graphics), and given the increase in 'web-enabled' cellphones, PDAs, &amp;c., non-graphical compatibility (including 'graceful degridation')is an issue that should be taken more seriously by web developers.  </s>
<s> I work frequently with users who are blind and visually impaired.  </s>
<s> Many, many pages that they run into either crash or confuse their text-to-speech programs / dynamic braille displays so badly that they're unreadable.  </s>
<s> OTOH, Lynx-compatible pages are generally far less of a problem for them.  </s>
<s> (Yes, O'Rourke, I know you didn't mean to slam Lynx.) This issue is increasingly important as more and more blind and visually impaired users are discovering the internet (especially the WWW and e-commerce) as ways to increase their independence.  </s>
<s> The W3C has released accessibility recommendations which address both 'web-enabled' non-graphical compatibility and accessibility for the blind / visually impaired, but I don't see their recommendations being adopted much.  </s>
<s> Oh, and there'd still be a WWW if everyone were still running on Apple  </s>
<s> II's and Rainbows.  </s>
<s> It simply wouldn't be graphical.  </s>
<s> While it might not be as popular, it certainly would still exist.  </s>
<s> It was a good method for presenting information even before the "Here's a photo of me so you can see what I look like in RL" craze that lead to the graphical explosion Mosaic ushered in.  </s>
<s> Er... Last I looked, even in the IT industry slamming products and / or attitudes because they were just over three months old was a bit premature.  </s>
<s> Now _that_ is a sentiment I can (mostly) agree with.  </s>
<s> While I understand why compiling the source rather than the binaries would be preferrable, and can certainly sympathize with the frustration involved in a downloaded source that simply will *not* compile when one had expected it'd be an easy job, posting tirades like the message starting this thread is not only unadvisable and incindiary, but foolish as well.  </s>

<s> My coding needs and user base may be very different from yours.  </s>
<s> my addition: one very helpful resource i have used for style sheets is bradbury's topstyle editor (i'm not affiliated).  </s>
<s> in particular, i like the cross-browser check, and the built-in w3c validation option.  </s>
<s> you can set it to perform for various standards (such as which css definition you want to use or what browser compatibility you want) and run a check to see what will and won't work in the various browsers.  </s>
<s> it's not really that hard to do css that degrades gracefully under those conditions.  </s>
<s> you can get a free (nag ware) demo that is quite functional, or register for about $45 i believe.  </s>
<s> as a note, i investigated several style sheet editors, and found this one the best.  </s>
<s> i had never done thing one with style sheets before that and after reading the docs and doing the tutorial, i feel comfortable that i can use style sheets pretty effectively.  </s>
<s> and they are so powerful! it is also my understanding that using style sheets as opposed to hard coding style is helpful for making *more* accessible web documents, separating structure from presentation and making it possible for users to override your settings with their own settings and giving them more control over how content is conveyed.  </s>
<s> plus on browsers without css support, they see  </s>
<s> just a plainer version of your page--not hurting the usability at all.  </s>
<s> not to mention how incredibly easy it is to implement style changes after you've coded 20 pages!  </s>
<s> i find the combination of amaya--only producing valid code--and style sheets, doing things the "right" way, to be a great match, and am very excited to be learning so much new stuff.  </s>
<s> i'm sorry to hear the other list member had such a hard time with amaya; i realize there are several things i am not currently informed enough to do, like fiddling with source code or compiling my own version--many times i don't really understand what you all are talking about (but that's how one learns).  </s>
<s> and people will clearly have a difficult time using the software if they don't already have a good understanding of how to use html tags.  </s>
<s> but i personally was thrilled with finding a mostly-wysiwyg editor that produces valid code, i want to improve as a designer, and using amaya with css, i believe, has really allowed me to do that, fwiw.  </s>

<s> JSB, Good comments, thank you.  </s>
<s> Obviously my rhetoric was intentionally over the top (i.e., "so twentieth century" - technically the twentieth century doesn't end until midnight, December 31 this year at the International Dateline; the phrase was an allusion, though I can't remember what to).  </s>
<s> But to dismiss CSS as just so much bloat is at best misguided (and to do so in such a disrespectful manner is deserving of just the level of dismissal I leveled).  </s>
<s> There are obvious problems (mostly with regard to poor execution on the part of UA vendors, and legacy browser use) with using it as a top-to-bottom solution right now, but careful use (looking out for graceful degradation, as JSB says; I like that phrase) can be very, very successful.  </s>
<s> As you said, I didn't mean to slam Lynx.  </s>
<s> It is VERY VERY important to use it as you've suggested to support accessibility.  </s>
<s> My point was to slam the idea that new = bad, old = good.  </s>
<s> CSS isn't even that new; all three of the major commercial graphical browsers support it now to one degree or another (obviously the support is cranky, at best, but I think we all wish they supported it completely).  </s>
<s> Good page design should be able to manage pages that look good with or without CSS, to support legacy browsers and non-visual browsers.  </s>
<s> If my page isn't readable in Lynx *and* either Mosaic 3 or HotJava, as well as NS 3/4, IE 4/5, and the current Moz, I don't put it up until it does pass that test (I'm gradually working Amaya into that test routine, too).  </s>
<s> But I don't worry any more about making my page beautiful in Netscape 3, just easy to read.  </s>
<s> CSS provides web publishers a resource for vastly improving the readability of web pages and reducing download time (how many font codes can a single CSS line eliminate?).  </s>
<s> Two pages can be readable, but one more readable than the other: for instance, I use a little bit of color to emphasize defining occurrences and product names and such through CSS - and they show up as em, dfn or strong in NS 3. The key thing is to avoid using it for positioning and other dynamic purposes until such time as it is properly supported and non-supporting browsers are as rare as Mosaic 3 is now.  </s>
<s> Let us point out as well that aural style sheets are part of the CSS2 definition, and promise to vastly improve the user experience for non-visual users.  </s>
<s> As for the claim that with Rainbows and Apple IIs we'd still have the web - uh, no, we wouldn't - because if no one had had the ambition to improve upon the Apple II, no one would have had the ambition to try to hyperlink documents across computer networks, either.  </s>
<s> A rhetorical trick, I'll admit, but the point behind my comments remains valid.  </s>
<s> Apple IIs were great for what we wanted to do the first couple of years after they came out.  </s>
<s> Now we expect desktops to do a great deal more than the Apple II ever did or could do.  </s>
<s> Ultimately Amaya is a demonstration that number of new technologies (CSS, MathML, clean structural markup, and most importantly editing in the display browser) are possible.  </s>
<s> No point calling it bloatware and slamming the developers when you've already closed your mind to the value of the capabilities the software was designed to demonstrate.  </s>
<s> (and no, I do not mean JSB).  </s>
<s> I think LKM's and JSB's postings are good examples of how to contribute to a project rather than ridicule it because things didn't work exactly the way you wanted them to the first time you tried.  </s>
