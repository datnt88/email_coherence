JTidy seems to not be a full implementation of Tidy. 
Is there a better way I can use Tidy in a jsp application. 
George Matthes What's missing? 
JTidy has - strictly speaking - not been updated since August 2000, but it's certainly usable. 
To call the non-stable C version command line tool does not seem to be any better, hence no, there is no better way atm. 
Actually, I wonder about that. 
First, the C version is quite stable - thanks in no small part to the many bug fixes made by the JTidy crew. 
Second, with the advent of TidyLib, I think it would be very easy to generate a Java JNI wrapper using SWIG. 
I have done a Perl wrapper that works very well, indeed. 
The only downside to JNI, AFAI can see, is the installation is more cumbersome. 
There is very little loss of portability. 
Just a thought, Charlie
