<s> ....I'm concerned with the confusion and incompatibility this could bring, in the WAI User Agent guidelines, the onmouseover etc. events must be made available to keyboard users, therefore, if you duplicate focus and mouseover - you have the situation where users will see two actions, which could confuse, or equally cause scripting problems.  </s>

<s> In the "default" mode, focus and mouse events are conventionally independent, so the author's redundancy shouldn't pose a problem.  </s>
<s> In the enhanced mode required by the UAAG 1.0 -- keyboard access even to mouse handlers -- nothing suggests that an implementation would necessarily trigger a handler twice unless on explicit user request.  </s>

<s> There is a problem, if it is done in the obvious way.  </s>

<s> The narrowband display [including speech] user really needs these examples to be one item, not multiple.  </s>
<s> All this means is that we need a coordinated suite of techniques, end to end.  </s>
<s> Not that either approach is wrong or absent.  </s>
<s> We do need redundancy in the content and we do need it recognizable per the format so that the UA can handle it appropriately, as for example folding two screen regions into one active entity in the model before rendering it in speech.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>

<s> One name is enough, it's all about how you script, I see no accessibility issues, and certainly don't see anything bad with your demonstration, In fact, I'm somewhat confused what you're asking, you don't mouseover the A element, you mouseover the IMG element, if you place the onfocus event in the IMG rather than the A (you'll need to add a tabindex in IE for this.) then you'll get tab and onmouseover to be the same element.  </s>

<s> Not at all, you just use a more efficient script solution.  </s>

<s> possible  </s>
<s> As an example of scripting it fails badly, it's not "accessible" to numerous browsers, due it's poor method of "browser detection", I can't see how you could possibly use it as an example of a script, however accessible it is.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> there  </s>
<s> However, both Mozilla and IE have implemented it firing with a keyboard enter on the focused element, Opera 5 doesn't, it should be encouraged to, as you say a big bug, there's no DOM2 way of detecting a navigate on a click for example - other than specifically intercepting keyboard and click links.  </s>
<s> I've not looked at other browsers, but I believe Konquerer is the only other relevant browser to implement much in DOM2 and ISTR that does, but don't have it to hand to check.  </s>
<s> OnActivate is also, where implemented, not implemented as a substitute for onfocus in any case.  </s>

<s> Could 'event syntax' be standardised?  </s>

<s> A tabindex requirement, effectively involves naming again, and is non-standard.  </s>

<s> If no 'a' name is given, then could the 'img' name apply automatically.  </s>
