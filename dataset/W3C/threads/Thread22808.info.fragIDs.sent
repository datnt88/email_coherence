<s> Hi Guys: Sorry to bother you.  </s>
<s> A small request.  </s>
<s> I am working in the IT department of a Pharma research institute.  </s>
<s> I am new to the software field and I am interested in trying out XML programming in Java (Using DOM).  </s>
<s> But there is no scope for such kind of works in my working place.  </s>
<s> I tried out a few examples from IBMs website but i would like to invole myself in a project so that i can learn about XML-Java programming better.  </s>
<s> Can any of you suggest a few projects in XML programming in Java so that i can try out by myself.  </s>
<s> All suggestions are welcome.  </s>

<s> Can any of you suggest a few projects in XML programming in Java  </s>
<s> Anyone know of a particularly good book or website for DOM XML programming examples and exercises?  </s>
<s> I don't have any recommendation rignt now, and that seems to be what Bansi is looking for.  </s>
<s> Basically, any kind of data processing that you might perform on other structured data can be performed on XML; whcih kinds are appropriate depend on the kind of data you're using XML to represent.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest that you start by asking yourself what kinds of document you want to use XML for, and then what kinds of operations you want to perform on those documents -- creating them, searching them, updating them, comparing them, and so on.  </s>
<s> Then assign yourself some projects that reflect those tasks.  </s>

<s> Hi, I need to read in a DTD from a file that is provided by a third party.  </s>
<s> From the DOM created from this DTD I need to create a GUI which will allow me to enter information into text boxes to insert into the XML.  </s>
<s> For Example: Start with: (DTD) Next Step is: (GUI) cdlib cd + - Artist |AnArtist________________| + - Title |ATitle__________________| + - Format |AFormat_________________| - Description |ADescription____________| - Next Step is: (XML) Unfortunately I need to develop this Application in Delphi :(.  </s>
<s> As you see, the idea is to have an application that is fully dynamic.  </s>
<s> I have found some XML parsing components, but they don't seem to allow you to parse a DTD to create anything but a DOM Document Type.  </s>
<s> From here I am unsure what the next step should be.  </s>
<s> I also here that the DTD section of the DOM is likely to change greatly in level 3.  </s>
<s> Is the project just a pipe dream :)?  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks, David Charlton.  </s>
<s> P.S. Sorry about the lenght of this e-mail.  </s>
<s> From my postings on other groups I have found that a simple paragraph describing the problem just doesn't show the big picture clearly enough.  </s>
