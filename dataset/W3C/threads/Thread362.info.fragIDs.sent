<s> Hi: can someone point me to a document (document portion) or an article which clearly defines the rules for treatment of white-space and new-line characters within the HTML source ?  </s>

<s> According to the List-Owner's own specification of HTML 3.2 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html ; sometimes a little easier to read than the current 4.01 recommendation, especially for students): "Except within literal text (e.g. the PRE element), HTML treats contiguous sequences of white space characters as being equivalent to a single space character (ASCII decimal 32).  </s>
<s> These rules allow authors considerable flexibility when editing the marked-up text directly.  </s>
<s> " Another way to put it is that any sequence of 1 or more blank spaces and 0 or more hard returns is treated as a single white space unless it occurs within an element classed as literal text (like PRE); however, the &amp;nbsp; (and its numeric equivalent) entity, though displayed as a space, is treated for the purposes of text flow as a non-space character, and so spaces before and after an &amp;nbsp; count as a space additional to the &amp;nbsp; .  </s>
<s> 0 blank spaces and 1 or more hard returns usually behave like a white space, except between most element tags (e.g., between a / td and a td , or a /p and a p ), where they're ignored.  </s>

<s> I don't know whether that behavior (the hard return between images = white space behavior) is accounted in the Recommendation or not; it is analogous to the way a hard return is treated between text strings; for instance, Mississi ppi is treated as two words, not one.  </s>
<s> Thus I imagine this behavior has something to do with the way image elements are described in the DTD.  </s>
