Hi, After typing (inserting) text at the beginning of existing text, the tree debug dump via TtaListAbstractTree does not appear to have these characters. 
However all views render the inserted text properly. 
This does not occur when text is inserted in the middle or end of existing text. 
1. 
Is there a call to synchronize the debug dump tree? 
(probably commit the insert?!) 2. Is it strange that the views have the updates while the internal tree doesn't?! Thanks for any help!

All views render the inserted text only if the insert has been committed. 
Views don't share anything else than the internal tree. 
The commit is done as soon as you change the selection or you display a menu. 
Are you sure you read the right file or the right version of that file? 
I checked that on my version of Amaya (compiled with AMAYA_OPTIONS=-DAMAYA_DEBUG) and the dump includes the inserted text.

I 'xmodmap' my sun keyboard (qwerty) to get ? 
with 'Alt Graph' + 1. 
Under amaya, I have to type '+e to get the same result. 
it's OK BUT, how I get ?

(anonyme) Irene, I traced through the code and the debug code does go through the menu code which automatically calls CloseTextInsertion(). We're working off of a modified source base so I put that line in. 
Thanks.

With Amaya you just have to turn on "Enable multi-key" in the General Preferences to have access to ? 
(enter 'e) and ? 
(enter `c).

I didn't understand you are working off. 
Excellent, you found out the solution by yourself. 
Irene. 
In one window I have my bookmark.html 
opened and in an other I'm writing a doc. 
When I copy a link from the bookmark document and paste it in the doc I loose the link. 
I means that I get only the text of the link. 
And I have about 150 link to copy and paste. 
Have you a solution ?

(anonyme) Yes, we have. 
I guess you are selecting the link by dragging it with the mouse. 
So, you just select a character string: look at the status line, at the bottom of the window. 
It probably says "Text\...". 
Actually, what you want to copy is not that text, but the anchor element that contains that text. 
Travel the structure a bit up, until the anchor element (A) is selected. 
Use the F2 key (Windows) or the Esc key (Unix) to that purpose. 
The status line or the structure view help you to make sure you select an A element. 
Then copy and paste. 
It's quite fast: you don't need to drag over the whole text. 
Click anywhere within the anchor and hit F2 or Esc. 
That's it. 
Depending on the structure of your bookmark.html 
document you may even handle everything at once, by selecting the right part of the source document. 
Hope it helps, Vincent.
