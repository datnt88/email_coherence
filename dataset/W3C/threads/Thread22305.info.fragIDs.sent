<s> Hi DOM-ers I have a problem with modifying the text component of a node.  </s>
<s> What I am hoping to achieve could have the affect of removing emphasis from text,  </s>
<s> for example, ie, this xml document: gets transformed to: The approach which I am using is: 1. Get the text associated with the emph node.  </s>
<s> 2. append it to the text component of the myDoc node 3. delete the emph node Using Sun's Java xml-ea2 DOM API (http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/index.html),  </s>
<s> check out the following code for this purpose.  </s>
<s> In the example above, the method copyIntoParent (Node) would be called with emph as the parameter.  </s>
<s> The trouble is with the setNodeValue(String) method in the Node interface of Sun's API.  </s>
<s> I call it in the setTextInNode(Node n, String newText) method, but the print outs I have in the copyIntoParent(Node) method show that it has no affect.  </s>
<s> So: - are there any other DOM-ers using Suns DOM API? - is setNodeValue(String) the right method to call.  </s>
<s> if not, what?  </s>
<s> Any help/ suggestions will be cool thanks N public void copyIntoParent(Node n) { // get current node's text content copy it // into parent node, in place of current node // Has the affect of removing elements from // text content.  </s>
<s> // Print out the current text value of this node System.out.println("child " + n.getNodeName() + " " + getTextFromNode(n)); // update the text value of this node with the "** my new text **" setTextInNode(n, "** my new text **"); // Print out the updated text value of this node System.out.println("child " + n.getNodeName() + " " + getTextFromNode(n)); public void setTextInNode(Node n, String newText) { // Read the text that this node has // and append to it the new text that is to be added String currentText = getTextFromNode(n); currentText += newText; n.setNodeValue(currentText); public String getTextFromNode(Node n) { // get current node's text content Node child; String textData = ""; NodeList children; int numberOfChildren; // If the node has any child nodes, // bung all of them into a nodelist called children children = n.getChildNodes(); numberOfChildren = children.getLength();  </s>
<s> // Read each child now for (int i = 0; i  numberOfChildren; i++) { child = children.item(i);  </s>
<s> // If this child has some text, let's get it! if (child.getNodeType() == 3) textData += child.getNodeValue();  </s>
<s> return textData;  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 1 defines the nodeValue of an Element to be null (see the table in the discussion of the Node interface), so your approach wouldn't work in the DOM standard.  </s>
<s> It is, however, a source of irritation and confusion for many people, and some DOM implementers have defined a method similar to setNodeValue to do what you want to do with an Element.  </s>
<s> It's hard to come up with a clean, elegant solution here without adding serialization and parsing interfaces to the DOM, and that is considered by many to be a can of worms.  </s>
<s> The "DOM-ically correct" way strip out the emph markup, I believe, is to get the text nodes of "myDoc" and "emph" and concatenate them together, remove the "emph" element, then set the new Text node to be the only child of "myDoc".  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> Simplest is to 1. Get the TEXT node child of the "emph" node.  </s>
<s> 2. Get the parent of that "emph" node.  </s>
<s> 2. Use parent.replaceChild()  </s>
<s> to replace the "emph" node with the text.  </s>
<s> Right, DOM does not specify any behavior other than not throwing any exception in this case ... perhaps it's annoying, but that's how it's specified.  </s>
<s> (The only exception that can be thrown is for a read-only node; since that element isn't read-only, it mustn't be thrown there.) - Dave  </s>
<s> Hi Mike and David Thanks for your replies.  </s>
<s> The sun DOM API doesn't allow me to do this directly.  </s>
<s> But I managed to come up with a simple solution which does what is  </s>
<s> required.  </s>
<s> The approach is (see setTextInNode(Node n, String newText)): - make a clone of the text node which is to be modified - modify the text value of the node - replace this cloned node with the old one.  </s>
<s> The code for this is below.  </s>
<s> Thanks again Nigel ======================= 8  ==================== public void copyIntoParent(Node n) { // get current node's text content copy it // into parent node, in place of current node // Has the affect of removing elements from // text content.  </s>

<s> return textData;  </s>
<s> I think a more correct statement is that "DOM" doesn't let you do what you want without writing some additional code.  </s>
<s> You were neither running into bugs, nor were you using extended facilities in Sun's implementation (e.g. namespace support).  </s>
<s> So it's nothing specific to work Sun has done.  </s>
<s> There are more and less efficient ways to do what you're doing, within the context of the DOM APIs.  </s>
<s> We're glad that you have a solution that works for you! - Dave  </s>
