Hello, I will attend the WAI techniques telecon tomorrow morning (please could someone remind me of the time) and try to share some ideas I have wrt i18n guidelines. 
In preparation, Wendy has asked me to send out this information. 
I have been developing a dtd based on xmlspec for a techniques document for i18n techniques and creating an xml document containing some *very* preliminary content. 
All this literally over the last couple of days, so things are still very much in an exploratory phase. 
I will share some ideas with you tomorrow. 
In the meantime, you can look at what I have in HTML so far at: The xml version of that is: The dtd is And there is a condensed, alphabetised summary at l 
The HTML is produced using XSL, and styled with CSS. 
Hope that helps, RI Richard Ishida W3C

i haven't had a chance to look at it yet, but doubt i will do more work on our schema until i've had a chance to see if we can use xmlspec instead. 
i look forward to seeing how you used it. 
i let michael cooper (the "chair" of our task force) know that you'll be there on wednesday and that i'd like to discuss the work you are doing. 
at wednesday's meeting, would you mind giving an overview of what you've been doing? 
thx, --wendy 
Please find enclosed an html file I will use to illustrate some of my thoughts during today's meeting.
