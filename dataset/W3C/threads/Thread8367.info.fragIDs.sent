<s> Pages: 90 Date: 2003-3-5 WebDAV consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance).  </s>
<s> RFC2518 was published in February 1998, and this draft makes only minor revisions mostly due to interoperability experience.  </s>

<s> I'd like to thank Julian for this excellent and careful review!  </s>
<s> I agree with all of his points.  </s>
<s> The only one I was tempted to question was "Section 13: XML element definitions", where he suggested going back to the old syntax for DTD's.  </s>
<s> But upon further reflection, although I believe the new more flexible notation should be used when defining all new elements, for compatibility with old servers, we should probably maintain the element order defined by 2518, so I actually agree with that point as well (:-).  </s>
<s> So I vote that all of the changes suggested by Julian be made  </s>
<s> to the next draft of 2518bis.  </s>
<s> Note: I have no good idea about how to deal with the 5 author limit question (:-).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff Here's a set of both -bis03 and generic RFC2518 comments:  </s>
<s> Content: 03-C01 Paragraph 1: "A DTD is provided..." - "An informational DTD is provided..." 03-C02 4.4: "...or when they may be shown to a human user and hence require encoding in..." I'm not sure what the requirement "may be shown to a human user" is supposed to mean here.  </s>
<s> Proposal: just write: "...or when they require encoding in..." 03-C03  </s>
<s> 4.4: "Note that the use of a new top-level URI identifier as a namespace is considered by many to be a bad thing..." Rewrite as: "Note that both defining a new URI scheme just for the purpose of identifying protocol elements, and using just the scheme name as a namespace name is to be considered a bad practice, and should not be copied".  </s>
<s> 03-C04 4.5: "The value of a property when expressed in XML MUST be well formed."  </s>
<s> The value of a property always is expressed in XML (or more precisely: an XML fragment).  </s>
<s> XML by definition is well-formed.  </s>
<s> 03-C05 4.5: "The value of a property appears inside the property name element.  </s>
<s> The value may be any text, including valid XML.  </s>
<s> When the value is structured as XML, namespaces that are in scope for that part of the XML document apply within the property value as well, and MUST be preserved in server storage for retransmission later.  </s>
<s> Namespace prefixes need not be preserved due to the rules of prefix declaration in XML." 1)I think this needs to rephrased to use proper XML terminology, also 2)I think that namespace prefixes within the property value do need to be round.tripped.  </s>
<s> Proposal: "The value of a property appears inside the property name element and may be any kind of well-formed XML content, including both text-only and mixed content.  </s>
<s> When the property value contains further XML elements, namespaces and namespace prefixes that are in scope for that part of the XML document apply within the property value as well, and MUST be preserved in server storage for retransmission later."  </s>
<s> 03-C06: 6.3: "A lock token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lockdiscovery property in the response body, and can also be found through lock discovery on a resource.  </s>
<s> Each lock has only one unique lock token."  </s>
<s> Change to: "A lock token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lock-token header, and can also be found through lock discovery on a resource.  </s>
<s> Each lock has exactly one unique lock token."  </s>
<s> 03-C07: 6.4: "All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and, at minimum, recognize that the lock token does not refer to an outstanding lock on the resource."  </s>
<s> (old text) I think this is misleading.  </s>
<s> Any resource must recognize any valid URI.  </s>
<s> If a URI uses a scheme it doesn't know of, this simply means it doesn't identify any particular lock assigned by this server.  </s>
<s> So I'd recommend to get rid of this sentence, and possibly add a clarification to 6.3 instead.  </s>
<s> 03-C08: 7.4: "However, interoperability and compliance problems have been found with lock-null resources.  </s>
<s> Therefore, they are deprecated.  </s>
<s> WebDAV servers compliant with this document SHOULD create regular locked empty resources, which behave in every way as if they were a normal resource."  </s>
<s> This sort of suggests that lock-null resources indeed are still something different than a normal resource, which isn't true.  </s>
<s> 03-C09: 7.4: "Can be downloaded, deleted, moved, copied, and in all ways behave as a regular resource, not a lock-null resource."  </s>
<s> I think the term "downloaded" is misleading here.  </s>
<s> From a WebDAV protocol p.o.v., it probably should be "read".  </s>
<s> 03-C10: 7.4.: "SHOULD default to a content-type of "application/octet-stream".  </s>
<s> " No. I don't think there's consensus for that, and requiring a specific content type seems to have no value at all to clients (see also 8.11, "Locking Unmapped URLs").  </s>
<s> 03-C11: 7.8: "If an error is received in response to a refresh LOCK request the client SHOULD assume that the lock was not refreshed."  </s>
<s> I think we should make that a "MUST".  </s>
<s> 03-C12: 8.1.1.: "Some of the following new HTTP methods use XML as a request and response format.  </s>
<s> All DAV compliant clients and resources MUST use XML parsers that are compliant with [REC-XML]."  </s>
<s> Add "...and [REC-XMLNS]".  </s>
<s> We also need allow servers and clients to rejects a certain set of request/response that are indeed well-formed, in particular: -when it exceeds some predefined size or -when expansion of internal entities may cause a denial of service.  </s>
<s> 03-C13: 8.1.2:  </s>
<s> "Some of these new methods do not define bodies.  </s>
<s> Servers MUST examine all requests for a body, even when a body was not expected.  </s>
<s> In cases where a request body is present but would be ignored by a server, the server MUST reject the request with 415 (Unsupported Media Type).  </s>
<s> This informs the client (which may have been attempting to use an extension) that the body could not be processed as they intended."  </s>
<s> I'd like to understand whether this affects methods other than MKCOL.  </s>
<s> 03-C14: 8.1.3:  </s>
<s> "When the Location header is used in a response, it is used by the server to indicate the preferred address for the target resource of the request.  </s>
<s> Whenever the server has a preferred address, it should use that address consistently.  </s>
<s> This means that when a response contains a Location header, all the URLs in the response body (e.g. a Multi-Status) should be consistent."  </s>
<s> If we keep this paragraph, we'll have to define what "consistent" means here.  </s>
<s> 03-C15: 8.1.4.: "Note that HTTP 1.1 requires the Date header in all responses."  </s>
<s> That's not true.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.1 specifically supports clockless servers.  </s>
<s> 03-C16: 8.1.5:  </s>
<s> "If ETags are supported for a resource, the server MUST return the ETag header in all PUT and GET responses to that resource, as well as provide the same value for the 'getetag' property."  </s>
<s> Note that this breaks the "etag promotion" strategy used both by IIS and Moddav (PUT usually returns weak etags which later are promoted to strong etags when there was no other change to that resource within a specific time window).  </s>
<s> Therefore I'd make that a SHOULD (at least for PUT).  </s>
<s> 03-C17: 8.1.5.: "Because clients may be forced to prompt users or throw away changed content if the ETag changes, a WebDAV server MUST not change the ETag (or getlastmodified value) for a resource when only its property values change."  </s>
<s> Some servers do, and I don't think we can change that.  </s>
<s> Therefore I think this change at least needs explicit consensus on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> 03-C18: 8.1.6:  </s>
<s> "HTTP and WebDAV did not use the bodies of most error responses until DeltaV introduced a mechanism to include more specific information in the body of an error response (section 1.6 of [RFC3253])."  </s>
<s> That's not really true.  </s>
<s> HTTP indeed recommends to send error descriptions in the response bodies as well.  </s>
<s> 03-C19: General comment re: 8.1.6:  </s>
<s> I really like that change (actually, I like it so much that I'd like to have condition names for all frequently signalled problems....).  </s>
<s> However, if it uses the same format as RFC3253, it should be consistent with it.  </s>
<s> In particular, the names should identify conditions that must be met.  </s>
<s> For instance, use "allow-external-entities" rather than "forbid-internal-entities".  </s>
<s> We may also want to note that one DAV:error element can hold multiple elements identifying failed conditions.  </s>
<s> 03-C20: 8.2.: "DAV compliant servers MUST support the "0", "1" and "infinity" behaviors."  </s>
<s> Change to: "DAV compliant servers MUST support the "0" and "1" behaviors and MAY support the "infinity" behavior."  </s>
<s> 03-C21: 8.2.: "Note that 'allprop' does not return values for all properties."  </s>
<s> Change to: "Note that 'allprop' does not return values for all live properties."  </s>
<s> 03-C22: 8.2: "URLs for collections appearing in the results MUST end in a slash character."  </s>
<s> I don't think we have consensus for this being a MUST.  </s>
<s> 03-C23: 8.2: "Note that URLs and URIs in XML must always be fully legal URIs.  </s>
<s> For example, it is illegal to use a space character or double-quote in a URI [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> URL-escaping is commonly used (e.g. replace a space with a sequence such as %20).  </s>
<s> The URI must not appear in XML "unescaped", it must be in its legal URI format."  </s>
<s> This is misleading.  </s>
<s> Of course URIs must conform to the URI syntax - that's the whole point, right?  </s>
<s> In particular, there's no such thing as a "unescaped form" of a URI.  </s>
<s> URIs do not allow the space character, and therefore a URI never ever contains a space character.  </s>
<s> What we should say here is how servers should behave when their internal implementation model of collections allow member names that aren't legal URL path segments (answer: encode as UTF-8 octet stream, then URI-escape).  </s>
<s> 03-C24: 8.2.2: "This example also demonstrates the use of XML namespace scoping, and the default namespace.  </s>
<s> Since the "xmlns" attribute does not contain an explicit "shorthand name" (prefix) letter, the namespace applies by default to all enclosed elements.  </s>
<s> Hence, all elements which do not explicitly state the namespace to which they belong are members of the "DAV:" namespace schema."  </s>
<s> Change to: "This example also demonstrates the use of XML namespace scoping, and the default namespace.  </s>
<s> Since the "xmlns" attribute does not contain a prefix, the namespace applies by default to all non-prefixed enclosed elements.  </s>
<s> Hence, all elements which do not explicitly state the namespace to which they belong are members of the "DAV:" namespace."  </s>
<s> (Actually I'd rather prefer to get rid of this.  </s>
<s> RFC2518bis shouldn't try to give XML lessons).  </s>
<s> 03-C25: 8.7: "If the DELETE method is issued to a non-collection resource whose URIs are an internal member of one or more collections, then during DELETE processing a server MUST remove any URI for the resource identified by the Request-URI from collections which contain it as a member."  </s>
<s> I think we want to get rid of this statement.  </s>
<s> Does anybody implement this right now?  </s>
<s> 03-C26: 8.11: "The LOCK request may have a Timeout header."  </s>
<s> "may" - "MAY".  </s>
<s> 03-C27: 8.11, "Interaction with other Methods": "However, independent of lock type, a successful DELETE of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed."  </s>
<s> (old text) I think this is misleading.  </s>
<s> A DELETE on a resource only removes those locks that aren't inherited.  </s>
<s> 03-C28: 8.12: "A successful response to an UNLOCK method does not mean that the resource is unlocked.  </s>
<s> At most, it means that the specified token no longer identifies a lock on the resource."  </s>
<s> Change to: "A successful response to an UNLOCK method does not mean that the resource is unlocked.  </s>
<s> At most, it means that the specified token no longer identifies a lock on any resource."  </s>
<s> 03-C29: 9.1 (DAV header) allows coded URLs in the DAV header.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see the rationale for that.  </s>
<s> 03-C30: 9.4 (force-authenticate): is this the consensus we reached in January?  </s>
<s> Ilyas, did you take notes?  </s>
<s> 03-C31: 9.5 defines " no-lock " as a new special state token.  </s>
<s> I think this is unneeded - any URI which is known not to identify a lock MUST work as well, so we can simply recommend using something like " DAV:no-lock " (which is something that RFC2518-compliant servers already support).  </s>
<s> 03-C32: (old text) The example in 9.5.2 uses an invalid lock token (the URI scheme "locktoken" isn't IETF-registered, so it can't claim conformance to the uniqueness requirements).  </s>
<s> Just use a sample token using the "opaquelocktoken" scheme instead).  </s>
<s> 03-C33: 9.5.5: "The not production is used to reverse that value." Change to: "The 'Not' production is used to reverse that value." 03-C34: Section 13: XML element definitions  </s>
<s> I don't like the syntax change in the DTDs.  </s>
<s> For instance, activelock now is defined as: ANY value: Any number of elements, including one of each of (lockscope, locktype, depth, owner, timeout, locktoken, lockroot) It used to be: !ELEMENT activelock (lockscope, locktype, depth, owner?, timeout?, locktoken?) For consistency with RFC2518, RFC3253 and the ACL spec we really should stay  </s>
<s> with the old notation.  </s>
<s> 03-C35: Section 17: "which has explicit provisions for character set tagging and encoding, and requires that XML processors read XML elements encoded, at minimum, using the UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoding of the ISO 10646 multilingual plane."  </s>
<s> Unless we get rid of this section, we'll have to add UTF-16.  </s>
<s> 03-C36: Section 17: "Names used within this specification fall into three categories: names of protocol elements such as methods and headers, names of XML elements, and names of properties."  </s>
<s> We may want to add a new category (condition names).  </s>
<s> Editorial notes: 03-E01 Expiry date is wrong.  </s>
<s> 03-E02 IETF wants a maximum of 5 authors.  </s>
<s> 03-E03 Paragraph 1: "marshall" - "marshal" 03-E04 There are many places where example URLs do not use the set of example host names allowed by the IETF.  </s>
<s> 03-E05 8.1.5 uses the term "etag".  </s>
<s> HTTP uses "etag" only as header names, and talks about "entity tags" everywhere else.  </s>
<s> So should we.  </s>
<s> 03-E06 8.2.2 uses the term "progeny", which I haven't seen before in this context.  </s>
<s> Maybe replace by something more common, such as "members".  </s>
<s> 03-E07: 8.2.2. still uses concatenation of namespace names and element names to identify property names.  </s>
<s> Are there any more opinions on the use of DTDs?  </s>
<s> Has the consensus reversed?  </s>
<s> I thought the consensus was clear way back when I made the change to move from a specific list of children to the definition form of ANY (where appropriate) plus a list of possible children in English rather than DTD.  </s>
<s> Originally, there was a lot of discussion that overall seemed to favour DTDs that allowed both extensibility and validation.  </s>
<s> FOr example:  </s>
<s> Juergen Reuter Amsden James Hunt  </s>
<s> Julian Reschke  </s>
<s> Lauren Wood Are we back to the idea of throwing out the DTDs altogether?  </s>
<s> That would be OK by me.  </s>
<s> Sometimes English can be more accurate than a limited formal  </s>
<s> language.  </s>
<s> Say, why do so many names on this list begin with 'J'?  </s>
<s> Clearly Geoff should spell his name Jeoff &amp; I should change my name to Jelisa or something.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> Can you point to where this was discussed?  </s>
<s> Well. DTDs can *not* be used for validating WebDAV request/response bodies (hopefully we agree on that?). Thus new specs must make sure that they are clear about the fact that the role of DTD fragments.  </s>
<s> Usage of DTD fragments in RFC2518, RFC3253, ACL and the ordering spec *is* consistent.  </s>
<s> In the Ordering Spec I am trying to summarize how the DTD fragments need to be read [1]: This document uses XML DTD fragments as a purely notational convention.  </s>
<s> WebDAV request and response bodies can not be validated due to the specific extensibility rules defined in section 23 of [RFC2518] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".  </s>
<s> In particular: 1. element names use the "DAV:" namespace, 2. element ordering is irrelevant, 3. extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise, 4. extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise.  </s>
<s> Again, this is consistent with all WebDAV specs that are RFCs (or hopefully will be soon).  </s>
<s> The change I'm objecting to is:  </s>
<s> The "old" syntax in theory allows programmatic checking of XML bodies (with the caveats listed above), while the "new" syntax just uses prose.  </s>
<s> However, the main problem is it's inconsistency with all the other specs that we have.  </s>
<s> I would find it very confusing if the way DTD fragments in WebDAV specs need to be read depend on which spec (or which revision of a spec) you're looking at.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> [1] http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-08.htm l#rfc.section.1  </s>
<s> I think it's important to retain some of the ordering constraints given  </s>
<s> by the DTD fragments in 2518 - specifically it is useful that a client  </s>
<s> can assume that in the response element, a propstat MUST be preceded by  </s>
<s> an href.  </s>
<s> Since a propstat cannot be interpreted without knowing which URI it applies to, if this constraint is missing, the client is required to be  </s>
<s> able to batch propstats in memory until the href arrives.  </s>
<s> With this constaint, propstats can always be processed on the fly.  </s>
<s> joe  </s>
<s> I really don't care much about the issue.  </s>
<s> However, we really really need to  </s>
<s> decide this, and then stay consistent.  </s>
<s> The current situation obviously is  </s>
<s> problematic.  </s>
<s> *If* we decide that ordering *is* relevant, we should clarify that both  </s>
<s> servers and clients must reject messages that do not comply.  </s>
<s> I don't want to  </s>
<s> end up in a situation where some clients work with non-compliant servers,  </s>
<s> while others don't.  </s>
<s> However, my feeling is that *currently* almost everybody ignores the ordering, and that server behaviour is *not* consistent.  </s>
<s> Thus from a standards progress point of view, it would make sense for RFC2518bis just to  </s>
<s> state that the ordering is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Stream processing of response bodies is a very interesting problem.  </s>
<s> However,  </s>
<s> I think even if you can rely on ordering, it is still hard.  </s>
<s> For instance,  </s>
<s> how do you process: D:responsedescription The user does not have access to the DingALing property.  </s>
<s> This is malformed: &amp; A compliant client must reject this reponse, because the body is malformed.  </s>
<s> BTW: you will need to batch the propstat element until you've reached the  </s>
<s> DAV:status element (confirming it's a "200") anyway.  </s>
<s> I don't see a big difference to waiting for the closing response tag.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> I'd suggest that we start with a generic statement that DTD implied ordering is to be ignored, but that the definition of a particular element can explicitly declare that ordering matters.  </s>
<s> WRT this particular case, I don't think that the amount of memory/time required on the client to read in the propstat before knowing what  </s>
<s> URL it is for is significant enough to matter (but like Julian,  </s>
<s> I don't care strongly either way, so I wouldn't object if the consensus is to make ordering matter in this particular element).  </s>
