The ERB schedule calls for voting on Feb. 26 on these items. 
3.1.a 
Should we have a principle that all linkage information is encoded in GIs and/or attribute values, never in character data? 
It would make parsing (and thus the writing of XML apps) much easier if this was so, and I think that's what we should encourage. 
Providing an additional way to do something just complicates it, unless there is some serious tangible benefit. 
///Peter Yes. 
ht If information==definition, yes. 
No. Unenforceable, and sometimes it's useful anyway, such as for supporting links from every word to dictionaries/glossaries/etc, for links from 'the current selection', etc. Yes. 
Sean Sorry. 
I think we should say that all _XML-linking_ information is encoded in GIs or attribute values. 
With generic markup people can _implement_ any behavior that they can define -- but we are defining behaviors that people can count on -- and links in CDATA are not such behaviors unless we define how they work. 
I think the fact that people can implement other linking mechanisms goes without saying, but we should be explicit about exactly what is permitted by XML linking.

Maybe longer. 
"Permitted" might be the sticking word. 
All XML Linking can say is what a conforming application must guarantee. 
What is done beyond that by use of other attributes or element types is not something XML enables. 
Otherwise, we are stuck trying to provide the mechanisms for extensions to XML Linking when in effect, that should be an issue for XML 2.0 once XML 1.0 has been shaken like a rag doll in the dog's mouth with a kid pulling on it. 
We are the dollmaker, not the dog or the kid. 
len As someone not familiar with the current representation of links (other than HTML) but who is almost certainly going to have to think about implementing the decisions :-) I'd like to make some general points which I hope the ERB will know what to do with. 
I hope very much that whatever comes out of Phase II will not limit the expressibility of the language (i.e. that we are not deliberately constraining authors from doing desirable things - sorry that's so woolly). 
As I have developed my DTDs I have kept finding the need to add more attributes for expressivity and I think that in novel applications of XML that will certainly be the case. 
Diversity of expression is a valuable creative outlet. 
On the other hand, everything in this spec has to be implemented, and fast. 
One possible choice is between: (1) XML-LINK ... and (2) FOO XML-LINK="..." In the first case we could create a class XMLLINK.java whilst in the second we would inherit LINKability: public class FOO implements XMLLINK {...} There would be a significant, but manageable coding overhead (I think) if both were allowed. 
(In systems with multiple inheritance, like C++, it might be possible to do it with less effort, but MI has its own problems). 
The overhead would (I think) be small compared with the implementation of XMLLINK itself, but in (2) there could be a greater burden on the programmer who will have to implement XMLLINK (though they can borrow code). 
It is easiest if *all* GIs may have XML-LINK attributes because then they can all be subclassed from XMLLINK.java. 
So my gut feeling to all these questions is that a general flexible solution is desirable and manageable, but that it's important to remember implementation whilst making these decisions. 
HTH P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences If by character data you mean embedded parsed character data the answer is yes. 
But the attributes as such must be CDATA to allow # to appear! 
There is one proviso. 
There should be nothing to stop you repeating the attribute information as the content of the link element.

GL3 2PU, UK So, structures like the nameloc/nmlist or nested FCS links cannot be legal XML Links? 
Then it is not legal to state that a link can contain a series of IDs which are an aggregate of link targets? 
What is liking information? 
Does this mean that in the content of a link, (e.g, A href="foo" bar /a ) bar is not linking information?
