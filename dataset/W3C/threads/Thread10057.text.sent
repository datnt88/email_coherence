This is one of many possible test cases to clarify whether RDF/XML is really layered on XML, and we whether we expect standard XML processing to apply: RDF/XML !DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [ rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" N-TRIPLES _:a http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label "Some test text" . 
Yes/No? 
Brian Brian McBride said: Why is this question being asked? 
RDF/XML is defined above several XML specifications and it is absolutely clear and easy to find what they are in the Normative References section of: which cites the following XML standards: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0, Second Edition Namespaces in XML XML Information Set XML Base So anything that forms a legal infoset of them, is usable in rdf/xml. 
That's not well formed XML - the rdfs:label element doesn't balance. 
Yes But what exact point is this demonstrating? 
Dave Brian McBride said: Thought it might make a change from tidy/untidy :) In a recent conversation I thought it was said that there was no requirement that an RDF/XML processor need do 'standard' xml processing. 
I didn't think that was the case and wanted to check. 
That is the answer I expected. 
In effect that you do need to run the RDF/XML through a conformant XML parser. 
Brian For me, yes. 
#g Graham Klyne yes, of course.

I share this concern. 
The test cases should: - test how RDF and RDF/XML work. 
- test how RDF interacts with other standards where there is doubt. 
I agree with Dave's analysis that there is no doubt here and so think we should avoid this test case as the thin end of a very thick wedge. 
Do we need to show how RDF/XML interacts with entity refs, chracter refs, external entities, various badly formed XML thingies, relative namespaces that have been deprecated according to the plenary decision, .... 
As an implementator I need to be aware of these issues (or delegate them to library code), but that doesn't necessarily make them appropriate things to test. 
I believe that we have test cases already that use entities for the namespace declarations, and I will be surprised if we don't use an entity for &amp;xsd; in our datatyping test cases, but perhaps we shouldn't have a specific test to demonstrate this. 
I think I would abstain if this test case were put for approval.
