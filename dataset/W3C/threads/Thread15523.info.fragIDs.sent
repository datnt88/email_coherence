Subject: Make summary attribute on TABLE requried? 
Hi Daniel, David Abrahamson (ISO) has asked the HTML WG to make 
the "summary" attribute on TABLE required, rather than option, obviously in the interest of accessibility. 
(see Do you have any thoughts on this? 
The rest of the WG has not manifested any interest. 
Thanks for a quick reply, Ian Ian Jacobs / 401 Second Ave.

to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: 
ASG:: He actually had two suggestions. 
For straw poll, my $.02: make required? 
no. populate the attribute in examples in the spec? 
yes.

I agree completely with Al's comment. 
You may also be interested in work I have been doing on checking HTML files and automatically fixing up many forms of bad markup. 
HTML Tidy generates warnings for missing summary attributes on tables and missing alt attributes on IMG. 
I hope to extend it to cover other accessibility related aspects and would welcome suggestions on ideas for this. 
I have submitted a paper on Tidy to WWW'7 and plan to make the software available free, to W3C members in January and a month later to the rest of the community. 
See: p.s. this software is still undergoing internal trials and subject to change as we detect remaining bugs. 
Please hold off on using the software until its formally released through W3C.
