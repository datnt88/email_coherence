Is it possible to create MAPs which use block-level content? 
I will play around with this a little more myself, but if anyone has done it, please let me know. 
And could we please have the AREA type prompt for ALT text?

Hi, just some points to maybe think over ... ;-) + in the menue help there is no entry "using amaya" (the page you get when going up from the help-pages) + I'd be pleased if there were an entry in menue Help which could be called "Amaya's Home" with a link to the homepage with further information + the logos on the left top of the help-pages could be linked to the w3c and the amaya-homepage best wishes, roland roland.bauer@fff.at
