Issuette: Should we change the term: "plain literal" to mean a literal of just a lexical form, and then have a new term "language tagged literal"? 
Possible text based on a 'yes' to this question is: Section 6.5 RDF Literals A literal in an RDF graph contains one or two named components. 
All literals have a lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal Form C [NFC]. 
Language tagged literals have a lexical form and a language tag as defined by [RFC-3066], normalized to lowercase. 
Typed literals have a lexical form and a datatype URI being an RDF URI reference. 
Plain literals do not have a language tag or datatype URI. 
Notes etc unchanged. 
Possible text based on a 'no' answer (i.e. the term 'plain literal' is unchanged) Section 6.5 RDF Literals A literal in an RDF graph contains one or two named components. 
All literals have a lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal Form C [NFC]. 
Plain literals have a lexical form and optionally a language tag as defined by [RFC-3066], normalized to lowercase. 
Typed literals have a lexical form and a datatype URI being an RDF URI reference. 
(Hmmm I had thought that the 'yes' text was going to be obviously better, but it's not clear). 
The rest of the goofy literals proposal is more-or-less as in: with possible knock on effects of the terminology change with plain literals. 
(Note some of these knock on effects occur in semantics and are quoted in the issue resolution below. 
The equivalent text in 2003May/0151 is with the meaning of plain literal unchanged). 
Further note: the wording used, which actually caused the comment, is intended to be suggestive of a many sorted logic to prevent confusion between say a language tagged literal and a typed literal, or a plain literal and a uriref. 
I avoid being explicit about this because: (a) I think it is overkill solving a problem that isn't really there - this is obvious (b) the complexity of explaining a many sorted logic is greater than the benefit in clarity (c) I believe the wording in semantics allows the separation of the domain of discourse questions from the abstract syntax questions. 

PROPOSE Accept danc-02. 
Our design of literals was a bit goofy, and we have changed it: **new text as above** Moreover, we believe some of the concern was to do with the denotation of literals in the domain of discourse. 
To avoid copying any goofiness in the abstract syntax into the domain of discourse, we have hence changed the following rule in rdf-mt: From "if E is a plain literal then I(E) = E" to "if E is a plain literal "aaa" then I(E) = aaa" "if E is a language tagged literal "aaa"@ttt then I(E) = aaa, ttt " The textual gloss is: "Plain literals and language tagged literals are always interpreted as referring to themselves: a character string or a pair consisting of two character strings." 
The informative text in concepts: "As recommended in the RDF formal semantics [RDF-SEMANTICS], these plain literals are self-denoting." 
becomes "As recommended in the RDF formal semantics [RDF-SEMANTICS] plain literals and language tagged literals are self-denoting." 
Could you please suggest what, if anything, should be done to the Primer if this proposal is accepted? 
Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Either is acceptable to me; the difference is editorial; I'm happy for the editor to take his pick. 
I'm pleased to see the following substantive change; it's responsive to my comment: Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Given that the benefit is not clear to you the proposer, and the obvious cost of the potential impact on other specs, do you still wish to propse the change of terminology? 
Can we reduce this to one proposal? 
Brian OK - tomorrow morning, I'll send a single proposal based on the plain literal unchanged version.

Brian As promised the updated proposal, no change to the meaning of 'plain literal'.
