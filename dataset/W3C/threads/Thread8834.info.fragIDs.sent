<s> Canonical XML spec, and "canonicalization" can also be lowercase.  </s>
<s> Also globally, "transform"(s) can be lowercase unless it refers to a Transform(s) element (in which case you have it marked up code ).  </s>

<s> Hi Susan, thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> Ok. Fixed the one remaining base-64.  </s>
<s> In english text moved Base64 to lower case, retained lower case in URIs.  </s>
<s> All instances I found refer to spec.  </s>

<s> Fixed about ~6 of Transform; one of signature, otherwise XML Signature is retained.  </s>
<s> That is a purposeful term used from section 4 of  </s>
<s> ok.  </s>
<s> ok.  </s>
<s> ok.  </s>

<s> I believe it is Normalized Form C.  </s>
<s> Could you provide a citation that this is the proper way?  </s>
<s> Regardless, Don did the RFCs and I think they are consistent amongst themselves, though not with other references.  </s>
<s> ok.  </s>
<s> Thank you!  </s>
