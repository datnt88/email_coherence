Does anyone know of a means to set the system font to wingdings in MS, or anything else that is not easily read? 
for some reason MS fonts all seem to be :-( Linux or Mac would be great as well :-) Sorry if this appears off topic, I'm giving an accessibility talk soon, and have been asked to provide some concrete examples that everyone can relate to. 
Kynn's Greeker rotates the text so it's unreadable, without actually changing the font, in an effort to mimic reading problems. 
Or, you can do something like this in a user style sheet: * { font-family: Wingdings, Symbol; } m This shouldn't work in a good modern browser with good modern fonts, as it should realise that the characters aren't covered by these fonts and use a basic fallback font, or display invalid character markers. 
The only reason it might work is because of prior use of the Symbol font hack to output Greek characters on HTML 3.2 and earlier browsers. 
I would would consider it a bug if it worked in the strict mode of a modern browser. 
Matt, these are two great suggestions, I'm hoping someone might know how to change the system font, the one that controls the ua menus etc., to wingdings. 
Jonathan For many, if not all, versions of Windows, the System fonts has to be a bitmapped font, not an outline (TrueType) one. 
The font is typically selected by the .inf 
file for the display driver, but I doubt there is much of an aftermarket in bit mapped fonts, and non-Latin ones are probably not licensed for US/European Windows. 
In character mode, you should be able to use "setfont" on Linux.

Thanks One that renders HTML correctly, and, in particular, does font resolution correctly in this case. 
I didn't test various browsers here, although Lynx will never display m as mu (unless you lie to it about the screen font encoding - with Windows, you generally cannot lie about the font encoding, because the font and encoding are inextricably linked. 
I know older browsers will, incorrectly, display m as mu if Symbol font is selected. 
It is likely that newer ones will do as well, in quirks mode, because this particular abuse is common in the wild.
