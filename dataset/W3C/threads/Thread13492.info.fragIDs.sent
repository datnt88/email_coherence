<s> Hello, Our new charter went into effect last week.  </s>
<s> With this I am moving our home  </s>
<s> page to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/  </s>
<s> Note that the IG and WG pages are redirected to this new page.  </s>
<s> Should we change the mailing list address to w3c-wai-er?  </s>
<s> All other WAI  </s>
<s> groups have an e-mail address of that form (e.g., w3c-wai-ig, w3c-wai-gl), but I'm not too concerned with that.  </s>
<s> It might cause more confusion than it is worth.  </s>
<s> Just a thought.  </s>

<s> Yep, I like consistency.  </s>
<s> By the way, can the "reply to" field in the e-mail be changed to the list and not the individual?  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill  </s>
<s> if we do that, we should think of calling it w3c-wai-ert, same for the site url: /WAI/ERT.  </s>
<s> nope, this is a W3C wide policy, discussed many times in various forum and very unlikely to change.  </s>
<s> if you're receiving duplicates, you need to sort that out on your side (like most people do, based on the message id).  </s>
<s> Wendy, Thanks for getting the new charter together.  </s>
<s> It looks good but I have a few comments: The mission statement refers to the WCAG 1.0 only.  </s>
<s> Should we not be working on the upcoming WCAG 2 as well?  </s>
<s> I see no mention of EARL.  </s>
<s> Should this be part of the charter?  </s>
<s> The charter refers to the AERT but it does not seem to be in our list of deliverables.  </s>
<s> I think we're going to need an AERT for the WCAG 2. This document is related to the GL and AU groups but I don't think either of those groups will create it.  </s>
<s> Should we (ER) take it on again?  </s>
<s> FTF meetings quarterly?  </s>
<s> Can we reduce that to every 6 months or even once per year?  </s>
<s> It's OK with me to change the name of the mailing list.  </s>

<s> Hmm, changing the name of the list is fine, so long as the archives are continuous with the old ones - i.e. if i go to the archive and search for something it should be able to search all the ER IG archives at once (or potentially the er-ig and er-wg ones...) I ahven't completely thought this through, but I guess you get the issue.. cheers Chaals  </s>
