Hello, I'm currently trying to implement a WebDAV server. 
Getting properties with DAV Explorer works, but Microsofts WebFolder does not recognize my implementation as a valid WebDAV server. 
Something is missing in my implementation of the protocol. 
I append a logfile and hopefully somebody can give me a hint. 
(I'm using Tomcat as servlet engine and http server as well).

Or else it will look for frontpage extensions (_vtf_inf.html). 
So for the OPTIONS request that is comming first you should respond by giving the headers DAV and MS-Author-Via "DAV :1.1" "MS-Author-Via: DAV" When WebFolders sees this then it will send a PROPFIND webdav request instead of the GET request that you are getting now Cheers D.Madan Mohan I think the problem is your Allow: you don't list MKCOL or PROPFIND so the webfolders is thinking you are not a DAV server and is switching into FrontPage Extension mode. 
A good way to find out what you need to return is run a packet tracer and connect with webfolders to a DAV server, like www.sharemation.com and see what they return to make webfolders think it's a DAV server. 
John Glavin RiverFront Software Manager Oh, geez. 
What has this list come to. 
Three replies, and three incorrect (or close to it) answers... A1: "respond with HTTP/1.1" -- well, this is obviously not a prerequisite because we see that Web Folders *does* end up doing a PROPFIND. 
So it obviously doesn't mind. 
A2: "use 'DAV :1.1' and 'MS-Author-Via: DAV'" -- the former should be the 'DAV: 1,2' header and the latter is not required (it simply optimizes out a round trip). 
We also see in the log below that Anton returns those for the /DAV directory. 
A3: "return MKCOL and PROPFIND in the OPTIONS response" -- he is returning PROPFIND (but not MKCOL). 
Web Folders doesn't need the MKCOL... it already believes there is a DAV server there by the simple evidence that it issues a PROPFIND. 
Sigh. 
Yes, using HTTP/1.1 in the response is a good idea and is technically required (and it will help with connection persistence and request pipelining). 
But it isn't a precondition. 
It would be good to return MKCOL, too. 
I'd also suggest getting rid of that Status: header (it's useless). 
I believe your real problem exists in the Multistatus response. 
You are using the "DAV" namespace *prefix*, but have not placed the elements into the "DAV:" *namespace*. 
Change your outermost element to: That should hopefully do the trick. 
I haven't thoroughly analyzed the body of your multistatus, but a rough glance seems to show it is okay. 
Also, have you seen the Slide project?

Or the Magi-DAV project?

Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/ 
Hello all, Thanks for the answers. 
Specifying the namespace (xmlns:D="DAV:") in the multistatus response is the solution. 
Confusion was caused probably through the following: I specified "http://muc01134:8888/DAV/" in WebFolder. 
"/DAV/" induces tomcat to invoke my own servlet (because I configured it in that way). 
WebFolder now tries to get a response from "http://muc01134:8888/" before finally going to try "http://muc01134:8888/DAV/". 
This is the reason for having some leading requests (WebFolder checks for frontpage extensions) and responses in my logfile, which are handled by the HTTP-Server itself and without invoking my servlet. 
Best regards, Anton Schegg Oh, geez.

Cheers, -g Accidentally caught by the spam filter. 
I've added Joe's new email address to the accept2 list. 
- Jim server The OPTIONS response should include the headers DAV: 1 MS-Author-Via: DAV (the latter is only for best results against MS clients) As others have said, PROPFIND etc in the Allow header (don't know if MS clients check this or not). 
... then, the PROPFIND response is not right. 
You need to use namespaces properly, e.g. first, and then replace DAV: everywhere below with D: ?xml 
version="1.0" 
encoding="UTF-8"? 
DAV:multistatus DAV:response
