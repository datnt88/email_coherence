FYI: With Amaya 7.1 on Windows XP, I can print to some printers fine, but I always get message "Error - Source: PrintOnePage (1)" when printing to an HP LaserJet 2100, even with Print to File checked. 
Other applications can print to this 2100 printer w/o a problem. 
george herson Are there any newer drivers for it? 
Is it WHQL-certified? 
If using a manufacturer-supplied driver, does the Windows-supplied driver work or vice versa? 
Brant Langer Gurganus On Sun, 29 Dec 2002 20:39:56 -0500 That error message means that the Windows function StartPage returns a value =0 In this case Amaya cannot send information to that driver.
