<s> Amaya 1.4 is a useful tool.  </s>
<s> I like the structure editor a lot and there are many other features like the math editor which are very innovative.  </s>
<s> For my normal work I mainly miss a HTML-Source editor.  </s>
<s> Just a button or menu which opens a text-editor like notepad (Windows) or emacs would be all I need.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your good work.  </s>

<s> For functionallity available with general tools which is usefull for amaya, I'd like to see some 'hooks' to have amaya start my favorite tool: For editing source, amaya should switch to readonly mode and start the ascii-editor which is configured in the thodrc file: "ascii_editor=nedit %d/%f".  </s>
<s> Once this editor is closed, amaya should re-read the file.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, netscape has a similar approach.  </s>
<s> For handling url's which amaya cannot handle, like "mailto:" amaya should be capable on invoking other applications, configurable in the thodrc file: "mailto_app=dtmail %u".  </s>
<s> Details on invocation of those applications, they accept the next options: "%f"Filename (without directory: index.html  </s>
<s> in an url) "%d"Directory (the /Amaya in an url "%%"% character "%h"Hostname or domainname (the www.w3.org in an url) "%p"Protocol (the http in an url) "%u"entire url (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/index.html)  </s>
<s> And others I don't think of at this moment.  </s>
