<s> Graham, Please may I second what Miraz and David have said.  </s>
<s> Here is the key point for customer care, or the quality benefits that you gain from gathering feedback.? The people with the answers most always see the world through a more fine-grained set of pigeonholes than do the people with the questions or complaints [That's a FAQ].  </s>
<s> For emotional and "comfortable language" considerations, you always want to give the customer room to vent in their own terms, without forcing them to cram what they have to say into a set of narrow pigeonholes.?  </s>
<s> This implies accepting email feedback.?  </s>
<s> This is costly,?  </s>
<s> It is a lot cheaper to run a form and just look at the spreadsheet of the aggregated form results, but you get what you  </s>
<s> pay for.? Forms and spreadsheets will not tell you about usability or accessibility issues with your site that you probably did not anticipate in your design and your form, or you wouldn't have the problem.  </s>
<s> Because the implementation of mailto: URLs is spotty, you should really  </s>
<s> have an email address in the plain text of the page as well as automation using a if you wish.  </s>
<s> But Miraz is right.? You should offer the user a choice.? Here is an area where the technology does not capture enough of the user preference distribution into one technical approach for you to rely entirely on one technique.? People's comfort levels with different technologies amenable to feedback vary all over the lot.? If you really want to hear from people, you will tool up for multiple modes to cover that diversity.  </s>
<s> AND, while we are on it, the usability problems for forms for people with disabilities are severe enough at this time so that if you do choose to implement a feedback form only, you are significantly hurting your chances of hearing from this constituency.? At least if you look at the penetration studies of the AFB for people with visual disabilities, I believe that you will find many more are fully at home sending an email as compared with how comfortable they are filling out a form.  </s>

<s> I agree with Miraz - If I cannot find an email address (If I really need to I may spend uop to half an hour poking around a site to find one!) or find a waty to send *myself* a copy from a web-based form, I either do not send a message, or do not buy the product, or whatever.  </s>
<s> It has to be really, really URGENT to get me to use a form in such a case.  </s>
<s> If you're seeking the "best way to get feedback", a web form is not the way, in my opinion: you'll have people electing not to send any feedback, because the can't keep a record of what they're sending to whom.  </s>
<s> The best alternative would probably be to provide both an email link and a form.  </s>
<s> BTW, I also encode a page name for the subject in the email links for my sites: that way I'll know what people are actually commenting on - at least in most cases.  </s>
<s> That's somewhat harder to do if you have access to server-side programming, and impossible if you don't.  </s>

<s> Not really a proble if you know how to fool the scrapers.  </s>
<s> They need a "text" email address in your page source) code.  </s>
<s> All you need to do is to URL-encode the email address (even partially: just encoding the '@' would already fool most crapers); most email clients (as opposed to scraping robots) have no problem with it.  </s>
<s> (Some links checkers do - ignore them.)  </s>
<s> In fact, this is *so* easy (and well-published) I did not even think of mentioning it.  </s>
<s> Once your address has been scraped, it's precious little use "hiding" it though: it just gets passed around by spammers - on those fancy CD's you get al the spam about!  </s>
