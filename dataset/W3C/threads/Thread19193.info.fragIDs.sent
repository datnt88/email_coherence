<s> Hy, I'm trying to open a LMML document with Amaya, but the layout is strange.  </s>
<s> There is not the titles, no itemize and a lot of other things.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> The LMML site say that many of the XML-editors currently on the market  </s>
<s> support the LMML format.  </s>
<s> Amaya not?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Francesca  </s>

<s> Could you give us the URI that causes the trouble?  </s>

<s> I did not check with any particular LMML document, but I guess that the problem is that there is no CSS style sheet linked from the LMML document.  </s>
<s> Except for a few languages such as XHTML, MathML and SVG, Amaya does not know about formatting of XML documents.  </s>
<s> It relies on CSS style sheets to format and display those documents.  </s>
<s> It does not support XSL.  </s>
<s> So, if you use an XSL style sheet, Amaya does not do anything with it.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the examples.  </s>
<s> Amaya doesn't valid xml documents, it verifies 'only' their well-formedness, builds a DOM-tree that corresponds to the source document ans displays the content of the elements in the formatted-view.  </s>
<s> You can associate xml style-sheet to improve the display (as it is made in your document) but for the moment, Amaya supports only css style-sheets, not xsl ones.  </s>
<s> It's the reason why the layout of your documents looks 'strange'.  </s>
