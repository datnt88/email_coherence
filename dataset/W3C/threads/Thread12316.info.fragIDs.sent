<s> I hope I will be able to get an agenda online later today, but there are a few issues arising from the face to face such as confirming what we want in a charter ('cos we need to do that), when we would like to change our teleconference time and what suits people and what we can get (mostly list stuff but we can mention it) and some real content and relationship to other groups and conformance evaluation issues Regrets to the list as always please cheers Charles W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia  </s>

<s> Forgive the dumb question but I have trouble working out the time difference now.  </s>
<s> As of last weekend, we're on "Summer time" (Daylight savings time?) - we moved the clock one hour ahead in the Netherlands (and most of Europe).  </s>
<s> Same in Boston - or is there a 7-hour difference now instead of 6 hours?  </s>
