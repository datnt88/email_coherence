<s> RFC 2060 defines a new character set encoding, as a modification of UTF-7.  </s>
<s> However, it does not give a name to this encoding, which means that different vendor libraries will use different names for it, causing confusion (or worse, they may call it UTF-7, even though it is not).  </s>
<s> Therefore, I request that a name for the encoding in RFC 2060 is registered.  </s>
<s> I propose the following entry in the registry: Name: RFC_2060-mailbox MIBenum: assigned by IANA Source: RFC-2060 Alias: csRFC2060mailbox  </s>
<s> Please let me know if you need further information.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin  </s>
<s> What about an alias like IMAP-mailbox or something like that somehow gives the developer a sense of what RFC2060 really is, without the need for remembering numbers?  </s>

<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> Better yet, throw out all the numbers (except of course for the 'Source' entry).  </s>
<s> This is a new registration, so we don't need any superfluous aliases.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Sounds good to me.  </s>
<s> It is actually mailbox names, not the mailboxes themselves that are encoded in this encoding, but I thought that mailboxname would be a bit too verbose.  </s>
<s> My main interest is to have an unambiguous official name for the encoding; what name exactly that is is of less importance to me.  </s>
<s> Thanks for you comments, Martin  </s>
<s> I have a general question about this: It appears that this encoding is only used in IMAP headers.  </s>
<s> It is not (intended to be) used anywhere else, right?  </s>
<s> Then why does this need to be registered as a charset?  </s>
<s> It is confined to one single protocol, well defined in that context, and otherwise not exchanged, so it does not need to be declared anywhere.  </s>
<s> There are many ad-hoc "encodings" that are protocol-specific, not used outside their protocols, and therefore do not need to be registered as charsets - witness the current discussion about ways to squeeze Unicode into domain names.  </s>
<s> Those "ACEs" do not need to be registered.  </s>
<s> If it _is_ registered, I would go for "IMAP-mailbox-name".  </s>
<s> A full registration proposal should note "limited" use.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, markus PS: I _did_ read RFC 2060 "5.1.3.  </s>
<s> Mailbox International Naming Convention" (p. 14)  </s>
<s> More accurately, it is used in IMAP mailbox names.  </s>
<s> It doesn't appear in email headers.  </s>
<s> Yes, but its use in IMAP mailbox names means it does inevitably appear in various other contexts.  </s>
<s> Filenames associated with mailboxes are one example; there are others.  </s>
<s> Speaking from personal experience, having a name to refer to this charset would be quite useful.  </s>
<s> I needed a name in code I've written and I would prefer to use a standard one rather than making one up that's bound to be different than what other people come up with.  </s>
<s> If this were true, perhaps, but the world isn't this neat in practice.  </s>
<s> Actually, the final ACE that is chosen for use probably does need to be registered as a charset, for the same reasons.  </s>
<s> And I have no problem with registering other protocol-specific encodings as charset names.  </s>
<s> Remember, registration is simply a means of identification, it doesn't imply endorsement for general use.  </s>
<s> We really need to get past the notion that we condone something by registering it.  </s>
<s> Personally I could not care less what the name is.  </s>
<s> This is as good as any other.  </s>
<s> Of course.  </s>
