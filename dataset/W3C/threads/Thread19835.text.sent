I successfully changed the following things in Amaya so that it behaves more as a common browser: Changing double-click to simple-click: Go to HTML.A and change: ElemActivate.Pre - DoubleClick to ElemSelectPre - DoubleClick. 
Pages in Read-Only mode: In html2thot.c 
near line 7580, there's the following commented line: /* TtaSetDocumentAccessMode(theDocument, 0); */ Uncommenting this line is sufficient to make all the pages Read-Only Menus: In EDITOR.A, Delete or Add all you want, and edit the file config/en-amayadialogue to update the menus names. 
the format is the following: First the main menus names from left to right, then the submenus names from top to bottom. 
Buttons: In init.c, in InitViewDoc: Just remove the buttons you don't want, the Math button is some lines after the main buttons, in an #ifdef condition. 
All the HTML debug output: In html2thot.c, 
just disable all the "*printf()" lines WARNING: sometimes you need to change a bit the code, because the "*printf()" line is the only line in a IF condition. 
There's output too from Thot/thotlib/base/thotmsg.c, in the first function. 
Same thing to do, disable the "*printf()". 
NOTE: I didn't tried to change this file yet but it prints the same message I see in the output so it's surely this one :) NOTE 2: I haven't yet tried to remove the editor code, although I plan to do it in the next few weeks, but I'm a little bit afraid of cross references between the browser part and the editor part of Amaya, so any information on the imbrications of these two parts would be nice. 
NOTE 3: I plan too to make a modified version of Amaya (with all the #ifdef needed to have a proper source) but this will need more time. 
NOTE 4: We have added too for internal use, a little modification to the GetObjectWWW function in query.c 
so that access is restricted only to servers specified in a file. 
So if someone is interested in it, just mail me and I'll send you the code(almost 30 lines), I didn't include it here, since it's unuseful for the majority. 
NOTE 5: I still have some problems to resolve: 1) It is still possible to write in the TITLE field. 
2) The search function in the menus can still modify the text, even with TtaSetDocumentAccessMode(Doc,0). 
3)When in Read-Only, the default text color is Green and I didn't find where to change it. 
4)Any info on cross references between the editor part and the browser part of Amaya would be nice. 
5)(optional) Showing in the bottom of the window the target of the link under the mouse pointer would be nice but I really don't have a clue how to do it...

I am doing similar stuff for client and have some questions or pointers if you can provide. 
1.How do I change Background color of Amaya. 
You should look at the HTMLP.P file in the amaya directory, many attributes are defined here. 
I didn't try to change this file so this is perhaps not the good one, but it seems to be the one you're looking for. 
2.How does Amaya take care of Links in HTML documents.I 
looked at html2thot.c and cannot figure out how "HREF" is handled and how can I get the co-ordinates of HREF i.e x,y,width,height of the link. 
That's one of my problems too, I don't know. 
Please let me know if you have any clues. 
Thanks in Advance Suhas Hassan Sultan Ecole d'Ing?nieurs de Gen?ve Switzerland In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 27 Jan 1998 12:25:07 +0100." 
Great ! 
This file prints toolkit error messages. 
you can change it if you want. 
From time to time we move functions from one module to another to avoid these imbrications. 
Normally all modules "edit" (like EDITimage.c or HTMLedit.c) must containt only edit functions and should be removed for a browser. 
I don't know how to avoid that with Motif and Windows. 
But Amaya refuses to change the document title when it receives the callback from Motif (on Return key). 
It's a bug. 
In files $HOME/.thotrc 
ReadOnlyColor=Black See NOTE 2 We need to add a Thot event to do that. 
It'll be available in a future version; not the next one because it's too late (we plan to do the public release next week). 
Regards Irene.
