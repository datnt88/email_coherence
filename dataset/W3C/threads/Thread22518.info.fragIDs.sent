<s> Joe, Because there is no way to set a default attribute, I have implemented createAttribute to returned with an Attribute whose specified value is true.  </s>
<s> Although adding 'specified' parameter to createAttribute might be useful for Level 2 when DTD support is fleshed out, I would prefer to add createDefaultAttribute method in Level 2 than having to worry about default attributes being set via setAttributeNode().  </s>
<s> If you set default attribute for one element instance, it will have to be reflected in all other instances of that element as well.  </s>
<s> It feels a bit hairy, don't you think?  </s>
<s> Don Park Docuverse  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, the PR doesn't state whether a newly-created Attribute has its specified flag set true or false.  </s>
<s> It would be safer to either make the intial value explicit, or (probably better) pass it in as an argument to the factory.  </s>

<s> I think I've concluded that I was confusing my stopgap implementation of default attributes with the real answer.  </s>
<s> In fact, Specified is a read-only IDL attribute in the DOM spec, so it had better default to true if XML Attribute objects returned from the factory are to be useful to DOM applications.  </s>
<s> In Level 1, Parsers and other DOM generators will have to use non-DOM methods to create and manage default Attributes.  </s>
<s> Creating and setting an attribute on a node via the normal DOM API should indeed set only the Specified attribute.  </s>
<s> The longterm answer will probably be to hang the default attributes off the DTD rather than attaching them directly to Elements, and to tell the Elements to consult the DTD if they don't have a local value for a given attribute.  </s>
<s> Among other things, that approach avoids duplicating default attribute objects all over the tree and means that changes to the DTD will immediately be visible throughout the document.  </s>
<s> It also nails down the fact that if you want to change the defaults, you do so by talking to the DTD.  </s>
<s> But default attributes are one of those areas that Level 1 left fuzzy, so we'll probably have to wait for Level 2 to nail down the loose corners on this issue.  </s>
