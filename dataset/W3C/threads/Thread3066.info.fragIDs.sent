I was comparing Mozilla's list of known selector bugs to the CSS Selectors test suite, and I found a few bugs that were not caught by the suite. 
The list follows, with links to relevant testcases: 
Interaction of :hover and ::first-line/letter: 
DOM changes and their interaction with :first/last-child: Dynamic handling of :empty. 
The test suite tests addition of content, but not removal. 
A more exhaustive testcase can be found at: ::before/::after content on table display types: ::first-letter on list items, when list-style-position is "inside": Dynamic handling of the '+' combinator when the DOM mutates: Behavior of ::selection if no rules are specified for it: There are also some things that do work in Mozilla but are not tested by the suite. 
For example, :link and :visited matching XLinks (assuming XLinks are supported at all): Matching of :link when dealing with malformed URIs (this is dependant on the UA not treating such links as links, of course... See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229700 
As a general comment, I see very few tests that test selectors in the face of dynamic changes (eg having :hover::before styles, scripted changes to the DOM, etc). 
I think that almost every static testcase in the test suite should have a dynamic counterpart or several such. 
For example, there should be contains() tests that mutate the document by inserting, deleting, appending text, thus causing contains() to match or not match (that's 6 tests, that could all be part of a single test page, of course). 
As things stand, one could have a very buggy contains() implementation that would work on small HTML documents and pass the test suite, but fail spectacularly on a large document if incremental rendering is done... Similar arguments apply to the :nth-* selectors. 
Similarly for dynamic changes to href leading to changed :link/:visited matching, changes to attributes when various combinators are used, and so forth. 
I can help write such dynamic versions of tests in July, but not until then... -Boris 
It would be nice to add those tests. 
I won't have time to do this soon (I'm working on getting a basic CSS2.1 test suite up so that we can then invite input for that test suite) but in the meantime if people want to add tests to the selectors test suite the instructions on how to write the tests are at the bottom of: You can also see the source files for the existing tests in that directory. 
Please try to follow the CSS2.1 test case authoring guidelines in general (except for the format of course) when writing tests. 
:-) Note that before any tests are added the working group will have to agree to adding the tests, so it's not an automatic process.
