<s> Many of my co-workers insist on using Dreamweaver (arghh), an HTML editor that is slightly less-bad than Frontpage.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, I find that it's biggest fault is that it throws in extra font tags all over the place..  </s>
<s> As I edit pages (by hand, of course), I often see opening and closing font tags right next to each other.  </s>
<s> And, of course, there're often a handful of /font tags at the end of the document ( /font /font /font ...).  </s>
<s> Anyhow, it'd be really cool if HTML Tidy could consolidate some of these Font tags :).  </s>
<s> But, I realize that this could be a bit difficult, especially since it's sometimes necessary to have extra font tags (each td needs a new Font tag, for instance).  </s>
<s> So, though I may not be able to help code the algorithm, I'd be willing to help write some pseudo-code, if that would help.  </s>
<s> And, if anyone wanted to join the "team", that'd make things easier as well.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this?  </s>
<s> And, yes, I realize that the font tag is discouraged, but the two major browsers treat CSS too differently for that to be a practical alternative ;).  </s>

<s> Bischoff, Alex:  </s>
<s> Make them use Dreamweaver 3, and whip them until they promise to never use that part of the program that produces font tags, but instead only use the part that produces CSS instead.  </s>
<s> It won't be paradise, but neither will it be hell anymore.  </s>
<s> Bertilo Wennergren  </s>
<s> Dreamweaver 3 can use Allaire's HomeSite instead of the built-in HTML editor, and HomeSite provides support for HTML Tidy (you can replace the included tidy.exe with a newer version and you can create a custom tidy.cfg of your preferences)...  </s>
<s> It should not be all that difficult to teach those of colleagues that like using Dreamweaver to keep a little bit of discipline and tidy up their documents through HomeSite...  </s>
<s> Also, as far as I know, Dreamweaver provides a function (under Menu/Extras maybe) that combines redundant font tags and also pretty-prints the code... So, ideally, the process of creating a pretty and valid HTML document with dreamweaver would be: make your layout, fill it with content, clean up with dreamweavers function in "Extras"(?),  </s>

<s> Yeah, for everyone that's asked, they are actually running Dreamweaver 3 g .  </s>
<s> To demonstrate what I mean, though, imaging this example text: What rolls down stairs Alone or in pairs Rolls over your neighbor's dog  </s>
<s> They'd type that in and then want to have it be blue text.  </s>
<s> So, they highlight and apply the color.  </s>
<s> Then, say, they want it to be size=2.  </s>
<s> So, they highlight and apply the size.  </s>
<s> But, instead of giving out one font tag, that generates two.  </s>
<s> Then, say, they want to make the last line orange -- so, that part is highlighted and the color is applied.. But, as you can see, by the end, there end up being several /font /font /font tags at the end of the text...  </s>
<s> Also, since some of you are Dreamweaver users, I have another question.  </s>
<s> And, this should be pretty easy to answer, as it just deals with configuration (but I don't know the answer myself because I choose not touch Dreamweaver with a 10 meter pole).  </s>
<s> Anyhow, what are the exact steps needed to change the spaces-per-tab size?  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it would seem that the Dreamweaver default is about 2, so you end up with weird "wave" effects like this:  </s>
<s> td avsdkj sadkvf lkasmdv And, I find that pretty difficult to read, but a larger tab size (6 or so) would make that much easier.  </s>
<s> So, what I'd like to do is to just email my co-workers saying "Please change your Dreamweaver tab size.  </s>
<s> Here are the steps needed...".  </s>
<s> And, yes, I could just use Tidy to reformat the tab size, but I'd like to kill this problem at the source ;).  </s>

<s> I just tried this experiment and it worked as it should... only one FONT /FONT pair was created and it just updated it.  </s>
<s> But if they select white space one time and not the other, it'll add FONT tags rather than edit the existing ones.  </s>
