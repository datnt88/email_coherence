The Penn State Academic Computing Web Accessibility Website has several references that seem to be based on WCAG. 
I have not confirmed that all of the info from WCAG is covered in their materials. 
This seems to be a really nice introduction to the topic. 
Are people aware of this site? 
Should we use it as a model for the "easy read" revision of WCAG? 
Are these people involved in EO WG? Should we encourage them to be in EO WG? in WCAG WG? --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa
