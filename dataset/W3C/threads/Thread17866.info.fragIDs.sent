<s> When available, developers should use APIs at a higher level of abstraction than the standard device APIs for the operating system, but only if these higher level APIs properly use the standard device APIs.  </s>

<s> What I heard people say at the face-to-face was that in this case, they should use *both* interfaces, not abandon the higher-level interface.  </s>

<s> When available, developers should use APIs at a higher level of abstraction than the standard device APIs for the operating system.  </s>
<s> If these higher level APIs do not use the standard device APIs properly, developers should also use the standard device APIs.  </s>
