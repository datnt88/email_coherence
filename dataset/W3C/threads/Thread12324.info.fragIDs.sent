<s> Here are some of the questions that have come up regarding the evaluation process: 1.  </s>
<s> Just like there is a need for views of the techniques for different authoring tools, do we need a multi-layer system for the testing e.g.: if the tool is a video editing tool then fill out section x and y, 2. Do we want to structure the evaluation process using the WCAG as the primary order with the ATAG as the secondary order or the reverse.  </s>
<s> The advantage of using the WCAG or a list of possible element types as the primary order, is that we can skip the section if the tool doesn't allow the authoring of that type of element.  </s>
<s> Or do we want to generate a new order that anticipates the new WCAG.  </s>
<s> 3. Do we want to take the approach of assessing whether the priority 1 checkpoints have been met and if they haven't, not to proceed with priorities 2 and 3, or do we want to check all levels each time?  </s>
<s> 4. What kind of reports do we want to generate?  </s>
<s> Do we want one report for the consumer and another more verbose report for the developer that also gives guidance on how to fix the problems?  </s>
<s> How should these reports be organized?  </s>
<s> 5. How much granularity do we want in the scoring system, is A/AA/AAA enough or do we want more specific scores for checkpoints or sub-checkpoints to allow ranking for consumers who are comparing tools?  </s>
<s> There are many more questions to address, please contribute ones that you can think of.  </s>

<s> Just like there is a need for views of the techniques for different authoring tools, do we need a multi-layer system for the testing e.g.: if the tool is a video editing tool then fill out section x and y, CMN Yes, I definitiely think this is ideal.  </s>
<s> (The other alternative is to have something like AERT with lots of n/a that would be checked - the latter can be done as a lead-in to the former, depending on how fast I get database stuff on our system under control.  </s>

<s> CMN I will address in a seperate thread 3. Do we want to take the approach of assessing whether the priority 1 checkpoints have been met and if they haven't, not to proceed with priorities 2 and 3, or do we want to check all levels each time?  </s>
<s> CMN If we have multiple view capability it makes sense to be able to split on priority.  </s>
<s> But in general I prefer to test all the waythrough where possible 4. What kind of reports do we want to generate?  </s>
<s> Do we want one report for the consumer and another more verbose report for the developer that also gives guidance on how to fix the problems?  </s>

<s> 5. How much granularity do we want in the scoring system, is A/AA/AAA enough or do we want more specific scores for checkpoints or sub-checkpoints to allow ranking for consumers who are comparing tools?  </s>
<s> CMN I would like to produce at the least a piece of information that says what checkpoints have been met, as well as the overall conformance rating.  </s>
<s> I would like to link those to information/comments where possible, on a checkpoint by checkpoint basis.  </s>
<s> I will talk to Karl about this too.  </s>
<s> also: I think we want to be able to identify assesment of a checkpoint according to who did it when, and I think that it would be helpful to be able to look at all assessments we have of a single checkpoint, as a guide ot people doing new assessments.  </s>
<s> I have been buried in another work item, but I am hoping to get lots of time on this in the next few weeks.  </s>
<s> Charles  </s>
<s> As everyone should be aware, the WCAG group has started the process of a revision to WCAG.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, this will eventually lead to a document which has more ofr less the same requirements (unless there is some clear need to change them, which they will be looking at) with more information on non-HTML, and hopefully better adapted to the needs of users like ATAG.  </s>
<s> Which means that at some point the techniques for relative priority, and the ways of testing those checkpoints, will be simplified.  </s>
<s> Until the new version is a Recommendation I think our techniques have to work on the old one (since the guidelines refer to it) but it is a good idea if we keep track of the development of the new, and where appropriate comment to the WCAG group.  </s>
<s> Note that one of the opportunities of our meeting in Bristol is to work with the WCAG group on the new draft at this early stage.  </s>
