<s> Dear Jose Kahan I have installed Amaya 2.2 and already downloaded Amaya 2.4.  </s>
<s> I rember reading on the website that one must uninstall any previous version befor updating.  </s>
<s> So I searched the Amaya website.  </s>
<s> But nowhere does it explain how to uninstall ?? Sorry if I seem dumb but I just dont know how.  </s>
<s> I have previous been exclusively a Windows user but now have a muliti-boot Win-Linux machine.  </s>
<s> I have no idea how to do the uninstall in Linux.  </s>
<s> can you please get this infor put onto the Amaya webpages as I am sure others may want to know.  </s>
<s> Any hints - advice - links - on how to do the uninstall for a Linux version much appreciated Yours John John Coombes (miesanz) Melbourne Victoria Australia Using Mandrake Linux v.7.0 + Netscape Comunicator 4.7 My Website :- http://www.users.bigpond.com/johncoom/  </s>

<s> You need to uninstall any previous Amaya in the Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> Unix boxes don't have this problem.  </s>
<s> If you're using rpm, you can just do an rpm -U name_of_the_amaya_rpm and everything will be taken into account :) If you want to uninstall the previous version, you can do a "make uninstall" in the Amaya directory.  </s>
<s> I haven't tried it, but it should work.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion.  </s>

<s> If you installed a .tgz  </s>
<s> version on a Unix system then removing it is simply a matter of deleting the directory where you put it.  </s>
<s> For example, I install Amaya in /usr/local/share/Amaya, but I also ahve a one line shell script at /usr/local/bin/Amaya that calls the binary from where it is installed.  </s>
<s> When I update my version of Amaya I usually put the new version into wherever I had the old version, so the shell command works fine.  </s>
<s> I also have a ~/.amaya directory where I keep preferences, a keyboard file, etc.  </s>
<s> That is only updated if I specifically do it - usually I manually copy the profiles and sometimes an ew amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> file manually.  </s>

<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> We do need an Uninstall doc page.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I modified the text, trying to make it clearer: NOTE: You MUST first uninstall any previous version of Amaya from your system before installing this one.  </s>
<s> To do so, use a tool in the Windows control panel tool which allows to "install/remove programs" (the exact name depends on your Windows versions... mine is in French!).  </s>
<s> This is a standard Windows tool.  </s>
<s> You don't have to copy your Amaya user preferences as they won't be affected by this operation.  </s>
<s> Well, preferences are stored in that tree (see the Configuring Amaya doc page).  </s>
<s> If you scratch it, you'll loose them.  </s>
<s> And there will be some traces left in the Windows history of installed program.  </s>
<s> We'll try to improve the doc.  </s>
<s> If anyone has time and inspiration to give it a shot, feel free to do so.  </s>

<s> I rarely use that, I generally use the uninstaller I have installed - because that gives me an un-uninstall facility!  </s>

<s> Ah, yes, but only for v1.4a ... I see now where thot.rc is for 2.1, it's in the Program Files\Amaya hierarchy as I had hoped.  </s>
