Kynn &amp; Gregory; Thanks for the quick responses. 
I have been doing a lot of research on accessible web design for my company, and was just saying how I bet there are more blind and visually impaired users than Mac users on the Internet - according to the OS and browser stats at http://www.StatMarket.com. 
Well...I was asked to back that assertion up by a manager. 
GULP I don't know how accurate the self-reported figures at GVU are, but they the only ones I've seen so far. 
It sure would be a boost to accessible web design efforts if we had a good source of these figures! 
Again, thanks for the quick replies.

Would it not be also appropriate to mention how many blind and viusally impaired users cannot use the internet at all? 
Just seems one should mention that.

aloha!

unquote an excellent point, and one which makes the statistic that Joel cited about the number of blind/vi cybernauts -- provided it can be proved -- even more impressive!

The problem is that, given a site which requires frames and javascript for basic navigation, it is a bit difficult to make an assessment of what they say... Fortuntely for me I can run a frames and javascript capable browser when i get back to the office, since i can see what it is doing. 
But it makes an interesting ilustration of the problem.
