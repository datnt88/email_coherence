agenda is online at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-11aug99 Please send regrets if you are unable to attend includes: rewording of 2.1 (adding an explanatory note) reordering checkpoints by priority technique reviews - sample implementations Last call (I'll write anote about this in a minute) --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org 
W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Along with these regrets I would like to call attention to a mindset exam in connection with the AU guidelines/checkpoints/techniques: we are almost entirely attending to these insofar as they deal with a major league authoring tool and there should be a probably separate addressing to the developers who would make it surpassingly simple to put stuff on the Web without any knowledge of anything on the part of the publisher. 
It is hard to conceive of a word processor that attends to all our urgings about making all docs deal with accessibility issues, etc. 
It is difficult to imagine that a graphics program will do much if anything and if we could hit the ALT="text" base pretty hard it might be all we can hope for. 
Anyway, I feel that we've attended too little to this area so perhaps some suggestions about content covering *just* the "save as HTML" problem would prove fruitful. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE William, this is one of the "sample implementations" that I we should do. 
In fact it is fairly close to the case of a "major league authoring tool" - it is a stated goal of the Mozilla Editor project, whose work will be the basis of Netscape 5 Composer, to produce a tool that saves as HTNML without the author having to know anything about HTML or the Web. 
From the other side, Office 2000 allows one to save in a kind of XML and I believe use it as a native format. 
Word has been able to deal with HTML documents as a native format for several releases. 
So I think the urgency of focussing on this kind of product in particular is less than on some products for which it is not quite so obvious - hence the image editor example from some months ago, and this week's multimedia editor example. 
I will probably focus next on a groupware system - there are a large number of these particularly in educational settings, as well as systems such as Notes. 
This sort of software probably also has the requirements which standard word processing and spreadasheet applications have that are seen as different from "regualr HTML authoring tools" so I think we will further reduce the amount of specific work that has to be done on generating techniques for word processors. 
As always, please offer your suggestions for techniques, either as single checkpoint techniques or for sample implementations.
