<s> Obviously it won't effect the test but is there a way to avoid this ?  </s>

<s> I typically use Sun's Multischema Validator.  </s>

<s> The casting logic depends on XSLT's key() function which has been unevenly implemented.  </s>

<s> Could you clarify?  </s>
<s> If "unevenly" means "bug", it needs to be fixed.  </s>
<s> Has this been reported to the developers of the various XSLT processors?  </s>
<s> If "unevenly" means "spec has a bug", that needs to be fixed.  </s>
<s> Has it been reported to the XSLT WG? If "unevenly" means "spec allows more variation than we'd prefer"... then this might be a portabilty issue in the stylesheet.... Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> I don't know what XSLT processor that Jeroen is using and I didn't have enough information to determine if the problem was with his source, the transform or the processor.  </s>
<s> Given the complexity of the test-to-java transform and its tendency to find bugs in XSLT implementations, switching XSLT processors is a quick way to identity if the XSLT processor is a part of the problem.  </s>
<s> If it uncovers an implementation or spec bug, then logging the issue is the right thing to do.  </s>
<s> I have vague memories of filing at least one bug on key(), but I can't recall the details and I believe it has been resolved.  </s>
<s> Good enough.  </s>
<s> (At some point, I really want to worth through the TS stylesheets with Xalan and make sure we understand all the issues.  </s>
<s> I just haven't been able to make time to do so, darn it...) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
