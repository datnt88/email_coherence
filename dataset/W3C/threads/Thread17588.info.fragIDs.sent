<s> There really should be standards for accesskeys, even if the standards state which keys should NOT be used.  </s>
<s> Most Windows applications reserve certain keys which make it possible to perform functions sans mouse.  </s>
<s> Here is a first go at a list of keys that I believe should be avoided for accesskeys: Alt + A through Alt + Z Software makers use Alt + printing character to activate menus, and there's no telling which keys they will choose.  </s>
<s> For example, Netscape reserves Alt + F, E, V, G, W and H. Opera reserves Alt + F, E, V, N, L, M, S, P, W and H. Furthermore, shortcuts are apt to change when a new version of a program is released.  </s>
<s> To add spice to the international soup, versions in different languages are apt to have different access keys.  </s>
<s> In addition, these Alt-key combos work in pretty well all Windows-based browsers: Alt + spacebar (activates System menu for application) Alt + hyphen (activates System menu for the pane) Alt + left arrow (go to previous page) Alt + right arrow (go to next page) That leaves available Alt + 0 through Alt + 9, Alt + most punctuation marks, plus Alt + F1 through F12.  </s>
<s> There are also Ctrl key combinations that should be avoided, but I don't know whether accesskeys work with Ctrl keys.  </s>
<s> (Well?) But for the record, Ctrl + A, B, C, F, N, O, P, V, X, Y, Z work in most applications (and browsers).  </s>
<s> I have omitted keys that tend NOT to work in browsers, but work in word processors, such as Ctrl + B, I, and U. Keyboard-only access to Windows is a wild and wooly area because of the lack of standards, built-in accessibility barriers, etc.  </s>
<s> For example, to activate the button-in-focus, use the spacebar or Enter key.  </s>
<s> All browsers I have seen, save Opera, break this rule.  </s>
<s> Netscape and Explorer force the user to use Enter key, only.  </s>
<s> Nothwithstanding the chaos, keyboard-only techniques are extremely fast and efficient for people who have trouble using a mouse or other pointing device.  </s>
<s> Some of my clients to whom I have taught keyboard-only access are 10 to 30 times faster than when using MouseKeys, trackballs, or whatever.  </s>
<s> (E.g., 1 second to perform an operation instead of 20 or 25 seconds.)  </s>

<s> These are not access keys.  </s>
<s> These are potential implementations of access keys by a specific user agent.  </s>
<s> "An access key is a single character from the document character set."  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey)  </s>
<s> The HTML spec says nothing about HOW a user might trigger an access-key, such as using the [ALT] key in combination.  </s>
<s> HTML documents which specify access keys SHOULD NOT assume it's going to be an ALT combination (what if your user is on a Mac?).  </s>
<s> How access keys are made available to the user is - must be - a user-agent consideration, since only the user-agent can know on which platform its running and, therefore, what triggering options are available and how best to assign access keys to avoid conflicts with common usage on the user platofmr and within the agent itself.  </s>
<s> Not all Web browsers support access keys.  </s>
<s> To learn if you can use access keys with this form, please check your Web browser's documentation.  </s>

<s> /disclaimer  </s>
<s> Modifiers for Accesskeys will be dependent on the keyboard model of the operating system and therefore would be difficult to assign a standard of "ALT".  </s>
<s> Even with operating systems with the "ALT" key some operating system already assign values to some of the keys.  </s>
<s> I think one of the major issues with Accesskeys is that the accesskey information be rendered visually on the disaplay so people know that there is an accesskey he available.  </s>
<s> This could be done by underlining the character in the label of the control or link associated with the accesskey.  </s>
<s> If the accesskey is not a part of the label, then the user agent could add the letter in parenthesis after the label or link.  </s>

<s> Alternatively the implementation could offer a seperate view of the page, which lists the accesskeys, explains how to use them on the specific platform (eg CTRL+ALT+key, say "access + key", press the item you want) and uses TITLE and LABEL to give information about the elements to which the keys refer.  </s>
