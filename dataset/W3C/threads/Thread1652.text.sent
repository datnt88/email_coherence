Hi, in RFC3253, A.18 Checked-Out Version-Controlled Configuration the supported methods are defined as: - all version-controlled configuration methods. 
In this case it looks like, for example, CHECKIN method is not supported by a checked-out versin-controlled configuration. 
I think that what is missing here is: - all checked-out version controlled resource methods. 
Regards Sasha I agree, this is a bug. 
I'll start an errata page and post it on the delta-v website. 
Thanks Tim May I encourage everyone who has read the spec to contribute to the Delta-V FAQ. 
The aim is to capture the answers that you found counter-intuitive, required further explanation, or were simply not covered in the specification. 
The FAQ is at http://www.webdav.org/deltav/faq -- and anyone can contribute. 
Regards, Tim
