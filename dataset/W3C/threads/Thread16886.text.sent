Hello, all, Can anyone recommend resources for finding statistics on Internet usage of people with disabilities (PWD) in the United States? 
I'm looking for things like how often, types of devices and platforms typically used to access information, etc., as well as demographics, types of information PWD are most interested in and the like. 
Thanks in advance!

Terrie Terrie L. King Internet Marketing Manager UCP National 1660 L Street, NW, #700 Washington, DC 20036 Ph.: 800-872-5827 Do you mean the internet, or do you mean "web pages". 
In any case, any such statistic will miss out the significant category of those who have not tried because they don't believe that they are able to use the internet (I believe this applies to a significant number of blind people, who believe it is a purely visual medium - which may be true of commercial web sites, but goes against the philosophy under which it was created). 
Any statistics are likely to underestimate the low end of the market because there will be no commercial interests to collect the statistics and many people will mis-represent their browser to web sites because of real and imagined fears that the site will discriminate against them if they give its true identity, rather than that of one of the big2 (this actually happened to early IEs, so IE actually identifies as Netscape (Mozilla), with a comment that it is IE!). 
A previous message referred to jimthatcher.com as a source of information on evaluation and repair tools. 
It is my understanding that this is a vendor website. 
If you want correct information on ACCVerify, you might follow these links. 
I am not a vendor. 
HiSoftware wins the da Vinci Award for "Electronics &amp; Information Technology" please see Government Computer News evaluated HiSoftware Accessibility Solutions. 
"If you manage geographically dispersed sites or have agency wide responsibilities, you'll be better off with the HiSoftware product line." 
To read the review please see: Forrester Research identifies HiSoftware as having the most advanced tools for accessibility, with complete testing &amp; repair solutions in it's "Design Accessible Sites Now" report. 
To order a copy of the Forrester Report, please visit: Jeanie Wells Assistive Technology Coordinator CSUMB (831) 582-3318 Neither is Jim Thatcher nor jimthatcher.com. 
He is a consultant, and quite section 508 and pioneered the 1st screen reader called Screen Reader for DOS, that where the term "screen reader" comes from, the "Kleenex" of facial tissue. 
Jim is just as independent as the authors of these reports that you recommend, and, more importantly, he is more knowledgeable. 
I don't know Mr. Steve Graves, a former GCN reviewer, and chief engineer at Communications Resource Inc. of Potomac, Md., but he's no accessibility researcher or pioneer. 
These articles only compare a few products, while Jim's evaluation compares them all. 
If you have some specific information about Jim's comment on AccVerify, I'm sure he would accept the input. 
I have and use HiSoftware, Lift, Crunchy, Bobby, SSB, and others. 
I have and read the Forrester report. 
I'm not complaining about the reports or reference to them, they are all good, just not complete without also comparison evaluations like at jimthatcher.com 
Phill Jenkins member W3C WAI Authoring Tools working group Phil, I had to chime in. 
Jim Thatcher has done and I am sure will continue to do good and important work, but this review SHOULD NOT be counted in that category and leadership at all companies should demand higher levels of accuracy in reviews. 
Jim Thatcher's Review of our Products is inaccurate and we brought it to he attention long before it was published, we sent corrections and he ignored them. 
From a scientific aspect, There appears to be no published supporting data and no Detailed Process Followed to back up his review or statements. 
* He says that he reviewed both releases three and four of our software. 
The differences between these products are huge! 
So from this perspective it is immediately invalidates the review. 
Additionally the review got our Registered trademark and product name Wrong AccVerify(r) Not ACCVerify. 
http://jimthatcher.com/erx.htm, 
this Speaks to the quality of review and attention to detail. 
Jim Reported Errors that were simply configuration options for individual checks not software errors. 
Jim makes broad statements of HiSoftware.Com and its Accessibility of forms, We have 1700+ Pages 100+ Forms, a Clear Accessibility Statement and He has no Supporting data in his review. 
Post the Data used for the Review versus saying that we are not accessible. 
I am sure the statement is now and was at the time of this review inaccurate. 
Now is Jim Independent with no vested interest??? 
This is important. 
Not to imply that it has Impact on the review, but it is a reality and there should be full disclosure. 
Answer: NO - HiSoftware Publishing with its Understanding Accessibility Book (500,000+ Distribution) Competes with Jim's Book that he authored - HiSoftware's Consulting / Professional Services Competes with Jim's Assessment Services - HiSoftware's Training Competes with Jim's Training Services From Jim Thatcher.com: 
As Jim says. 
Accessibility Is A Serious Issue I wish Jim Thatcher could have had the professionalism to complete a valid, Scientific, and correct review. 
In the long run it is the users of these products that will make the final decision. 
But with limited funding and maybe only one shot at purchasing the correct tool it is a shame to see such an incomplete, invalid, unscientific review produced. 
Why, Because, Accessibility Is A Serious Issue. 
And for those of us trying to educate and provide solutions it is essential that we be clear and not deliver unscientific or biased reviews. 
I imagine Phil that you can see why there are major problems with this review, and why it needed serious edits and corrections, and above all, why the writer of a review should care that everything be accurate and have supporting data. 
So I strongly urge all people performing evaluations to test these products for themselves, we all offer trial Software.

Erm, if you're not a vendor, why are you promoting information on exclusively one product? 
Is it by any chance the product you happen to be familiar with? 
IIRC, the OP asked for more general info than individual products. 
That's one reason I considered a reply pointing to my own pages would not have been particularly appropriate. 
But anyone reviewing accessibility products should of course include the leading online service (now also available in a desktop edition) at Nick Kew All, In the process of my evaluation I sent the draft reports to the owner of each product because I thought that was a respectful and helpful thing to do. 
Mr. Yonaitis claimed I ignored his response. 
Their 40 pages of comments (on a 10 page report) were far from ignored. 
I spent a day studying them carefully, and making changes in my report. 
Then I asked the technical writer that works with me (with years of experience in the accessibility arena) to also take a day and review the comments and rework the document. 
As a result, I think the AccVerify report is better written and more accurate than any of the other reports. 
Though not overall rated the highest, AccVerify was a only half-point from the highest. 
I would be the last to claim perfection. 
Mr. Yonaitis is right; in some places I erred and wrote ACCVerify instead of AccVerify(r), but not in the body of the report and certainly not with malicious intent. 
So there were maybe 30 occurrences of AccVerify and AccRepair and a couple occurrences of the misspelled versions with ACC (just like their logo). 
That may indeed be indicative of the report, of the kind of errors I made. 
Most of these were caught when the product owners reviewed their individual reports. 
The fact that I compete with HiSoftware for accessibility training and consulting applies also to the other vendors and that didn't stop them from complementing me on the report. 
It also doesn't stop me from writing an independent review. 
Competition on the book is a laugh. 
I hope HiSoftware is making lots of money on their book. 
The eight authors on "Constructing Accessible Web Sites" aren't.

Jim, I Like this, OK Again: - Please Respond with Every Inaccessible Form you noted on our Web Site.... - Please Note in your Review Which Version you were testing for Each Statement for your comments - Please note that the Errors you reported as Not Exactly 508 can be turned off or on by the user - Disclosure is Always Great, Don't be offended... 
I Will donate every penny made from our book to a charity you do the same Jim!, However, we give the book away, some people because of guidelines cannot accept free so they have to buy. 
- Please configure our crawler correctly before using it and read about robots.txt 
Show Supporting Data Please and do not stand on I am Jim Thatcher so I am above reproach. 
It is simple Jim your review is Invalid. 
How can you even call it a review when you mix two products. 
Make a claim that our forms are not labeled, did you check all one hundred+. 
I am not speaking for other vendors, but the arrogance that you show here is sad. 
As I sad Jim, You have done good work, this Review is not in that category. 
Correct it! 
I should have included Site Valet, A-Prompt, WAVE, RAMP, and others. 
But I didn't. 
And I am sorry.

TjL 30 Days to becoming an Opera Lover Day 14: Seek No Further (than your Personal Bar) Indeed. 
Coming from someone with (AIUI) credibility and a track record in the field, that seems to illustrate rather well that it's not merit that matters, but marketing. 
Clearly the merits (or otherwise) of the tools you didn't evaluate will be totally irrelevant to your readers. 
Which leads me to a question of my own: is there any way to get noticed by reviewers such as yourself for a developer with no resources to give a free lunch to one single reviewer, let alone a whole press conference? 
Nick Kew (currently living on less than one third of his country's official poverty line, and desparate for paying work) Giorgio, I agree that these reviews are "Very" important. 
We did write the memo and we did ask for supporting data. 
Since our discussion on this list we are working off list with Jim again and many changes have already been made. 
This work will continue. 
Thank you for your comments. 
Hopefully all companies and reviewers will work together to create great software and accurate reviews to help solve real problems. 
Additionally, in my opinion, in order to comment on the quality of a review one must validate its data and outcomes themselves before adding their name in support. 
I want to thank you for your comments. 
I am glad that you are pleased with your products reviews. 
Best Regards, Rob Yonaitis
