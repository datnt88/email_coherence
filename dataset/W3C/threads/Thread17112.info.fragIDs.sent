<s> acronym title="HTML Writers Guild" HWG /acronym Then I realised that the acronym title attribute actually contains an acronym in its self.  </s>
<s> Neither "HWG" nor "HTML" is an acronym.  </s>
<s> (Where I live, "HTML" is sometimes read as an acronym, pronouncing a vowel after each consonant, but even this would not make "HTML" an acronym.) But that's actually a bit different matter, and relates to the confusion between acronym and abbr .  </s>
<s> In fact, neither of these elements is of much use, since acronym is illogical for most abbreviations whereas abbr still isn't recognized by Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> Thus, it is _much_ more important to emphasize the need for explicit explanations of any unusual abbreviations, terms, and symbols, in the normal text of a document, or in associated (linked) documents.  </s>
<s> I've written a relatively long treatise on this: This particular technical issue is in fact an additional (small) argument in favor of my point.  </s>
<s> The technicality is that attributes cannot contain markup, so you cannot use any tags inside title="...".  </s>
<s> You could not use e.g. markup to indicate language changes (with lang and/or xml:lang attributes) inside an attribute value.  </s>
<s> Yet, indicating all language changes is a WCAG 1.0 requirement.  </s>
<s> (Actually, a requirement which is probably not satisfied by most pages that proudly show an icon claiming conformance to WCAG 1.0.)  </s>
<s> The ultimate problem is the design flaw in HTML that puts actual content into attributes.  </s>
<s> (We know that flaw from the alt attribute too: making the alternate content an attribute value restricts it to plain text - no lists, no tables, etc.) But we can avoid that problem when giving explanations of abbreviations simply by not using attributes.  </s>
<s> When you write explanations as normal content, they are accessible to everyone, and you are not limited to plain text.  </s>

<s> This technical problem is a reason why people are working on XHTML 2 and are preparing to make something that may not be backwards compatible with brosers designed for XHTML 1 (let alone browsers designed to cope with HTML 2 plus a few newer features...).  </s>
<s> Of course making a shift like this to XML is a big leap for people, and will take time, but then we are not yet living in a worl where HTML as a format for email is a really well-implemented thing.  </s>
<s> In part this is because it takes a long time for users to be generally aware of how to deal with things like tha massive security and privacy holes in most email clients.  </s>
<s> Which reinforces Jukka's final point - there are ways of providing accessibility that do not rely on a particular technology, but a partticular technique.  </s>
<s> If they also work well with the technology, and with current and known future standards, they are well worth considering, since they might be the best possible solution for the largest possible impact.  </s>
