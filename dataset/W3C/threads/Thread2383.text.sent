The webmaster@website convention is falling out of use. 
Has anyone considered making it a requirement for HTTP/1.1 compliance? 
Is it too late to even be talking about this? 
There have been numerous occasions where a web site has been sufficiently broken that I could not see any of the pages. 
I try to notify the administrators by sending mail to webmaster@website, but these days, more often than not, the address is unknown. 
Then what am I supposed to do? 
RFC 1123 requires all SMTP servers to support postmaster, so there is a precedent for a requirement like this. 
Or should people be encouraged to report web problems to postmaster when the web site is too broken to show the preferred address? 
AMC I don't think it's too late. 
It is essential that there be some such address, and "webmaster" certainly seems to bve the logical choice. 
Unfortunately, the term "webmaster" has been coopted (too strong a word?) to refer to HTML authors and web page designers. 
Even so, I don't think it would be overly confusing to use "webmaster" in way you suggest. 
A secondary problem is that many people maintain multiple webs on the same system (e.g., ISPs that provide web hosting) without having a separate domain. 
Typically, this results in URLs like I'm not sure how to handle this situation. 
gjw@wnetc.com 
/ http://www.wnetc.com/home.html 
If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come up with a better one. 
I was pondering this the other day. 
It occurred to me that it would be sensible to be able to ask a web server who the webmaster was for a particular URL. 
Then all such problems could be solved by careful configuration. 
I guess that would need a new method - which could return other stuff that is not normally of interest to the client. 
"INFO url ", perhaps? 
This may be related to the WEBDAV work that's going on at the moment.

Apache-SSL author I guess the question is, does postmaster refer to the domain or the server machine. 
I think reality wise, postmaster refers to the server most often. 
(ie sendmail can only direct stuff to postmaster for mail it receives, not that the domain receives... ) So, I think its appropriate that a host running a WWW server must have a webmaster address, which goes to the system maintainer, who can then refer it to the appropriate content author. 
Keep in mind that the message to webmaster may not be a content issue, it may be about a server misconfiguration. 
In the example you mention it's usually the same server for all users, and often for all domains served by that system.. Josh Cohen Netscape Communications Corp. Netscape Fire Department "My opinions, not Netscape's" Server Engineering josh@netscape.com http://home.netscape.com/people/josh/ 
Right. 
There i a distinction between content issues (broken links, etc.) and server issues and sometimes people will be sending mail rtegarding one or the other. 
My solution is to set up webmaster@wnetc.com, and almost all mail I receive pertains to issues I can handle. 
If necessary, I can forward it on. 
I suspect tht most people visiting the site won't know the difference between a broken CGI or an errant redirect (things I can address directly) on the one hand, and DNS or connectivity routing issues on the other.

There is another RFC in process that was addressing commonly used e-mail addresses like abuse@domain and webmaster@domain. 
I don't recall where it stands with respect to standards-track status and completion, but I think this question is not so central to HTTP that this group should spend effort on something being addresses elsewhere.

I believe that ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crocker-stdaddr-02.txt is in (or has passed) "last call" as a "Best Current Practice": This specification enumerates and describes Internet mail addresses (mailbox name @ host reference) to be used when contacting personnel at an organization. 
Mailbox names are provided for both operations and business functions. 
Additional mailbox names and aliases are not prohibited, but organizations which support email exchanges with the Internet are encouraged to support AT LEAST each mailbox name for which the associated function exists within the organization. 
and it includes a recommendation for "webmaster@site". 
In any case, this level of site management is not in scope for HTTP-WG.
