Goodness, tidy (vers 1st March 2004) puts where just existed before. 
That will take users a lot of work to clean up if that's not what they want. 
Could you be a bit more specific on why users would not want that? 
For HTML documents this is indeed not exactly what Tidy should do, and a known issue, but for XHTML 1.0 documents this is certainly the correct behavior and Tidy did that for many years... Are you using (SGML-syntax) HTML? 
If you use `id` *instead* of `name`, you won't get the redundancy. 
Note that for XHTML 1.1 going forward, `name` is completely removed, since `id` already does the job, plus `id` works with all other elements (i.e., you can old: most people are now writing: Which, BTW, is just as valid in HTML 4.01. 
The above of course is just an FYI -- it doesn't address the issue of what Tidy does -- or should do -- should you for whatever reason only want to use `name`.
