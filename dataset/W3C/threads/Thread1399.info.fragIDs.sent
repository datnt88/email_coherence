<s> I believe that all client implementors can correctly implement a simple string comparison against the value(s) in DAV:resourcetype.  </s>
<s> I do not have faith that *all* client implementors will (a) think about the issue long enough to realize that they can, in fact, infer the resource types from the supported live properties,  </s>
<s> Then this has to be spelled out in the spec in such a fashion that client implementors don't have to discover it.  </s>

<s> Clients and  </s>

<s> We are asking clients to do far more than Set comparisons if they are to use Delta-V effectively.  </s>
