<s> So, if a client submits a MKCOL without request body, it really only needs to expect a 201 (Created) as a response code (although it should do the right thing and treat all other 2xx responses as a 200, and a good implementation would also read the body of a 207).  </s>
<s> If a client submits a MKCOL with request body, it should expect either a 201 or a 207 -- both are legitimate responses.  </s>
