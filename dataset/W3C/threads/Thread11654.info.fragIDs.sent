<s> Hello W3C, I teach HTML in Berlin, Germany, and was enthused by Dave Raggett's short and excellent introductions to HTML and CSS.  </s>
<s> I have translated these pages into German for my pupils and would like (in accordance with your Intellectual Property FAQ 5.6) to inform you about the publication on Only two small mistakes found on http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html don't been taken over by me: The "margin-top" property specifies the space above and the "margin-below" specifies the space below.  </s>
<s> replaced with "bottom" The size attribute can be used to select the font size as a number from 1 to 6. replaced with "7" I would be lucky, if these translations received your approval.  </s>
<s> Thank you and best wishes, also to Dave Raggett, Ren x von Bulmerincq p.s. My translations from English to German are much better than from German to English.  </s>

<s> Hello Rene,  </s>
<s> Please note that the Intellectual Property FAQ 5.6 only speaks about specifications, not about other material.  </s>
<s> For other material, the permission has to be asked for on a case-by-case base, and in advance.  </s>
<s> I would like to ask Dave to decide whether we want to allow this or not.  </s>
<s> Dave, what's your opinion?  </s>
<s> If Dave agrees, I propose that the conditions are that you follow the FAQ (as you have done very well) and agree to it's conditions, but that you replace the sentence saying that the only normative version is the English one by a sentence saying where the original is, to avoid giving the impression that Dave's introduction is normative (which it is of course not).  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Many thanks Rene for reporting the 2 errors, which I have now fixed.  </s>
<s> I hope to get time to further improve the tutorials, e.g. to cover XHTML, but can't make any promises as to when I will do so.  </s>
<s> You are most welcome to republish the tutorials and I would appreciate any suggestions for improving the tutorials.  </s>

<s> Hello Dave, hello Martin,  </s>
<s> You are most welcome to republish the tutorials and I would appreciate any suggestions for improving the tutorials.  </s>
<s> excuse my misapprehension about IPR FAQ 5.6.  </s>
<s> And, Dave, I thank you for the subsequent permission to translate your three Tutorials.  </s>
<s> I replaced "the normative version" with "the original version" and hope that also one or another German HTML-beginner now loses his fear of this Markup Language.  </s>
<s> Regards, Rene  </s>
