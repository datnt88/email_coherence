<s> The latter isn't.  </s>
<s> (I believe it's a class which is a concrete instantiation of the org.w3c.dom.Document API -- one of many DOM implementations in Java -- but I haven't rechecked so don't take my word for it.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>

<s> True. But normally you directly instantiate only the DOMImplementation object, and thereafter create other DOM object only through the DOM's factory methods.  </s>
<s> This hides the details of exactly which classes are being instantiated... which is a good thing, since any reference to those specific implementation classes is, by definition, nonportable.  </s>
