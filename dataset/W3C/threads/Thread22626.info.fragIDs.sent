What is the difference between the classes org.w3c.dom.Document and com.sun.xml.tree.XmlDocument?

The former is part of the W3C's Document Model Object API. 
It's an Interface. 
The latter isn't. 
(I believe it's a class which is a concrete instantiation of the org.w3c.dom.Document API -- one of many DOM implementations in Java -- but I haven't rechecked so don't take my word for it.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research 
I thought an interface could not be instantiated. 
But I am using 
"Document" as if it were an object.

True. But normally you directly instantiate only the DOMImplementation object, and thereafter create other DOM object only through the DOM's factory methods. 
This hides the details of exactly which classes are being instantiated... which is a good thing, since any reference to those specific implementation classes is, by definition, nonportable.
