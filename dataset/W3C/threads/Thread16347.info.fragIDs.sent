<s> Hello Everyone, I'm trying to gather information on colleges and universities that have explicit policies on accessible web page design.  </s>
<s> If you know of a college  </s>
<s> or university with some sort of policy statement on the topic please share either an URL or the actual document with me.  </s>
<s> It is probably better to reply to me privately at kford@teleport.com as opposed to the group at large.  </s>
<s> I'll be happy to share the results of my inquiry with the list if there's suitable response.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kelly  </s>
<s> This question is a perfect opportunity to get some feedback on behalf of Utah State University and our new initiative which we have dubbed "Web Accessibility in Mind" (WebAIM).  </s>
<s> Utah State University is about to implement a Web Accessibility policy by the end of the calendar year.  </s>
<s> I have been a part of the decision-making process in that regard.  </s>
<s> Our first instinct was to require Priority 1 accessibility, but after taking a second look at the issues, we decided to implement most of Priority 2 as well.  </s>
<s> The only exclusions (in the draft)  </s>
<s> were the following: 1. Tables for layout (Priority 2, 5.3).  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, a website can be Priority 2 compliant and use tables for layout (if the table linearizes well).  </s>
<s> However, our main reason for deciding to be somewhat leniant on the issue of using stylesheets for layout (as opposed to tables) has to do with poor browser support.  </s>
<s> At some point in the future, we will reexamine this issue.  </s>
<s> 2. Applets and scripts (Priority 2, 6.4, 7.3, 8.1, 9.2, 9.3).  </s>
<s> Although we realize that inaccessible applets are a real issue, the scarcity of accessible java programs, perl scripts, etc. led us to be leniant in this area as well.  </s>
<s> Retrofitting existing scripts and applets to accessibility requirements is a large burden.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we could require that all _new_ scripts be accessible?  </s>
<s> Because this initiative is only a draft at this point, revisions can be made, and I welcome your feedback.  </s>

<s> Paul, I'd like to applaud you for a sensible approach to the web accessibility policy issue -- an accessibility policy needs to be  </s>
<s> more than simply "all the p1s" or "all the p1s and p2s" or "all the checkpoints, period", and instead has to consider each one individually and arrive at the best solution for your site and your needs.  </s>
<s> Priority 1s are must-haves, but every organization should carefully consider the P2s and the P3s as well.  </s>
<s> Paul, did Utah State look at any of the P3s?  </s>
<s> Some of them are so trivially easy to do (e.g.  </s>
<s> LANG="en" on the HTML tag) that doing them is simply a matter of decent templates, while others involve a greater degree of work.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Does your policy address services provided to your college web site by external vendors?  </s>
<s> The reason I'm seeking accessible web policies is to  </s>
<s> help gain some support for my view that a service my employer has contracted with to put a college bookstore online must be accessible or provide an accessible alternative service.  </s>
<s> Hi, Kelly and Paul, I would be interested in this too.  </s>
<s> As I mentioned earlier this month, the HTML Writers Guild (obviously not a college, but at least, an educational organization) has recently adopted a policy similar to that which you describe -- we require that our "partners" who provide services to our members do so in an accessible way, so as not to exclude our HWG members who have disabilities.  </s>

<s> Your question is a good one.  </s>
<s> As it stands right now, our policy does not directly address the issue of external vendors, and I thank you for reminding me of the importance of this issue.  </s>
<s> In our case, there are few instances of web content which has been handled through external vendors.  </s>
<s> Nearly everything has been home grown.  </s>
<s> The most significant exception to that statement is the use of Web CT in some online courses.  </s>
<s> The use of Web CT has presented a dilemma in our task of drafting accessibility policies.  </s>
<s> Web CT, as it is now, is not a disability-friendly program.  </s>
<s> In fact, this program is one of the reasons why we decided to be leniant with existing scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> The university has a lot of money and effort tied into courses in that program.  </s>
<s> The problem is that our draft does not prescribe a method for making sure that the Web CT content will--at some point--be accessible.  </s>
<s> Even though we realized this when we wrote the draft, the issue has not yet been fully resolved.  </s>
<s> Thank you for once again bringing the question to the forefront.  </s>
<s> I am likely to propose that all new contracts with external vendors include an accessibility clause, and that provisions be made to somehow gradually move existing scripts/applets in that direction.  </s>
<s> We'll have to figure out the most appropriate wording, timeline, etc. for that kind of action.  </s>
<s> Paul Bohman Technology Specialist Web Accessibility in Mind Utah State University  </s>
<s> Thank you for the support.  </s>
<s> Yes and no.  </s>
<s> As the list of U.S.U. web accessibility requirements grew (from Priority 1 to most of Priority 2), I wanted to make sure that I wasn't pushing my luck within the group.  </s>
<s> As of yet, I have not formally recommended any of the Priority 3 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Luckily, I am the one drafting the policy and I have some freedom with regard to its wording and criteria.  </s>
<s> The policy is due for official review next week, and, in accordance with your suggestion, I will revisit the Priority 3 guidelines.  </s>
<s> You mentioned the language attribute.  </s>
<s> Which other checkpoints from Priority 3 would you recommend as system-wide requirements?  </s>
<s> I open this question up to the group (...keeping in mind that one of my goals is to not instigate a major backlash from existing webmasters that would frustrate my efforts).  </s>
<s> Paul Bohman Technology Specialist Web Accessibility in Mind Utah State University  </s>
<s> The ones I feel are most "sensible" as system-wide requirements include:  </s>
<s> 4.2 Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document.  </s>
<s> 13.5 Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the navigation mechanism.  </s>
<s> 13.7 If search functions are provided, enable different types of searches for different skill levels and preferences.  </s>
<s> 14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page.  </s>
<s> 14.3 Create a style of presentation that is consistent across pages.  </s>
<s> These are all either easy to do (relative to the value they provide) or just common sense rules of web design or writing.  </s>
<s> You shouldn't shy away from making them requirements on your site simply because they have a the P3 label.  </s>

<s> aloha, paul!  </s>
<s> quote You mentioned the language attribute.  </s>
<s> Which other checkpoints from Priority 3 would you recommend as system-wide requirements?  </s>
<s> I open this question up to the group unquote to which i respond, here is a list of items that should have been accorded a higher priority level than the P3 with which they were classified by WCAG, and which are particularly important means of providing access to information in an academic setting 1. Checkpoint 4.2 "Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in  </s>
<s> a document where it first occurs" -- -- you should, however, stress that it  </s>
<s> is most important to use ABBR in documents where there are 2 instances of the same abbreviation (such as quote d r period unquote, or "Dr." which can mean "doctor" as well as "drive", depending on context); the same caveat applies to ACRONYMs 2. Checkpoints 9.4 "Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and objects." and 9.5: "Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls" -- in other words, use TABINDEX and ACCESSKEY in client-side image maps and in forms (Note: you will also need to require that when ACCESSKEYs are defined for an image map or form, that a list of ACCESSKEYs must also be provided, and linked to the form or the image map, so that users know that the ACCESSKEYs exist; a TABINDEX order listing is also highly recommended) 3. Checkpoint 11.3 "Provide information so that users may receive documents according to their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.)" -- basically, use META data; this will vastly improve any internal search facility your site may implement, which is an extremely important consideration when working in an academic setting 4. Checkpoint 13.6 "Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group" -- make a "Skip NavBar" link the first item in the navigation bar; if the navigational controls take the form of an image map, make the first link "A List of AccessKeys for this Page" (refer also to point 2 above) and the second link "Skip NavBar" 5. Checkpoint 14.3 "Create a style of presentation that is consistent across pages.  </s>
<s> " -- this is a basic principle of usability, as well as accessibility 6. Checkpoint 5.5 "Provide summaries for tables." -- this is not only important for tables used to present tabular data, but since you have decided to allow the use of tables for layout, you should use the SUMMARY attribute to indicate that the table is used for layout, so that the user of A.T. can take appropriate steps... of course, you should also ensure that any content which is marked up in a table for layout purposes linearizes comprehensibly... i hope you find this information useful -- if you would like clarification on any of these points, please let me know via the WAI-IG list, gregory.  </s>

<s> This is actually just good writing practice as well.  </s>

<s> Re the policy on applets on scripts, quote  </s>
<s> unquote It can be hard if the applet is actually interactively doing something, e.g. it's a little physics simulation.  </s>
<s> But when applets are used decoratively, e.g. to scroll text, it's pretty simple to have alterative equivalent content that appears when applets are turned off (just put alternative content between the last PARAM and the closing /applet .  </s>
<s> In this case the alternative is merely the text that's scrolled, possibly including links.  </s>
<s> Similarly with some SCRIPTS where it's simple to have a NOSCRIPT.  </s>
<s> Perhaps your guidelines could make this distinction and be tougher on the simpler cases.  </s>

<s> I agree that this is good writing practice.  </s>
<s> I could use some clarification, however.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the guideline to which you refer has reference to the HTML tags rather than inline text (e.g. acronym title="World Wide Web" WWW /acronym ).  </s>
<s> Does the guideline also refer to inline text?  </s>

<s> Your point is a good one.  </s>
<s> For the most part, however, it seems that the kind of alternative content which you describe is already covered in Priority 1, 1.1.  </s>
<s> The way that I interpreted the Priority 2 reference to scripts and applets was that the scripts/applets themselves had to be accessible as opposed to an alternative format.  </s>
