<s> After installing 7.1 LINUX version which at least started I can not help but show my disappointment.  </s>
<s> The editor display is garbled and does not show the last part of the file after synchronising.  </s>
<s> It seems that I totally misunderstand the use of pre tags now for years.  </s>
<s> Mozilla changes newlines inside a pre block to br /  </s>
<s> Amaya inserts a newline after a br / on every save.  </s>
<s> So most of my files became unusable and had to be edited with a text editor.  </s>
<s> Also AMAYA forces a maximum lenght of line inside a pre tag to be about 60 chars and inserts a newline.  </s>
<s> NOT FUNNY ANYMORE  </s>
<s> It seems there are about 50 people left which are interested in a w3c - conformant editor.  </s>

<s> Could you provide an example of a file with that problem?  </s>
<s> That would help to understand what happens.  </s>
<s> Yes, I have just checked.  </s>
<s> That's a strange behaviour.  </s>
<s> I don't see any reason to make that change.  </s>
<s> In a pre , a newline is enough to indicate a line break and it is perfectly valid.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> That's to make the source code more readable.  </s>
<s> But this is an issue within a pre , especially when Mozilla has turned all newlines into br/ elements.  </s>
<s> I have made a change in the CVS base.  </s>
<s> Newlines are no longer inserted after br/ elements within a pre .  </s>
<s> Are you sure?  </s>
<s> I have tried and the only newlines Amaya added within a pre where after the br/ (but that's fixed now).  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
<s> I'm one of them.  </s>
<s> I need not be but I am.  </s>
<s> I use Amaya all day every day to write all I write: log my software development work, document programs and systems, write articles, etc. Amaya fails, it's far from being perfect.  </s>
<s> I could stop using it whenever I want to but I don't because of the great value it has to me.  </s>
<s> Having a hyperlinked web of docs is fantastic.  </s>
<s> Being able to write it with the same tool I read is the value.  </s>
<s> With TopPage I could write fancy pages but not navigate them with ease, with Netscape I always could read |or|edit| pages -only in separate windows tools-.  </s>
<s> Amaya is ideal for me and I appreciate it very much, and every time I have an opportunity I thank the developers, every time I find a problem I try to help solving it.  </s>
<s> The other 49 people do more or less the same :-) Juan Lanus TECNOSOL Argentina  </s>
<s> Jochem, Did you count me?  </s>
<s> (you should).  </s>
<s> I use Amaya for HTML editing, because it's a lot more predictable and makes simpler HTML than other tools I've tried.  </s>
<s> Sure, there's a lot of features I'd like, and a few bugs to get rid of, but it's being actively supported, and minor bugs are fixed pretty quickly, and I haven't seen anything better for my needs.  </s>
