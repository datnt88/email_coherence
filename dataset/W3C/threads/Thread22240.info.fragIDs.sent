<s> Just saw this, gimme 10 minutes and I'll get back to you with a transform.  </s>
<s> Ok, here's a sample file.  </s>
<s> Check it out and I will be expecting input to take care of details.  </s>
<s> There are some issues with namespace output and validity (null xmlns declarations, I think it has to do with my msxml4) but I was in a hurry; got some deadlines over my head today.  </s>
<s> In case you need serious web based representation of the test files, I could modify some transformations from an on-going project of mine (a  </s>

<s> Didn't want anything like a grid display, just something that looked like pretty-printed XML when displayed in either Mozilla or IE and had some minimal hyperlinks.  </s>
<s> Just got in, won't have time to do anything useful before tomorrow morning my time, but I ran Manos' stylesheet which displays fine in Mozilla.  </s>

<s> The contention that non-validing implementations are not required to provide default attribute values and doctype nodes.  </s>
<s> This could be broken down into several subsets, those tests that require reading the external subset, those that require processing the internal subset, etc.  </s>
<s> You might review the Mozilla Dom L1 Core test summary that I did last November The getElementsByTagNameNS("*",...) interpretation.  </s>
<s> Whether "no effect when defined to be null" takes precedence over the NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR exception clause for setNodeValue.  </s>
<s> Did you mean JUnit or JSUnit.  </s>
<s> Dropping JUnit would be a bad thing since using a standard testing framework makes it easier for the DOM tests to get integrated into the standard build process of implementations.  </s>
<s> Requiring a custom testing framework hinders use of the tests.  </s>
<s> Having a custom runner for browser-based testing is beneficial, however I'd still like the tests to be runnable both with JSUnit and the custom browser runner.  </s>
<s> I obviously mean JsUnit, that was a typo.  </s>
<s> If possible, we should use the JsUnit framework, especially since Edward has been helping out in incorporating improvements; if the changes we propose are not consinstent with the framework we may have to drop it, though.  </s>
