<s> I would make the first sentence: 2.4 Allow as much time as possible for understanding and interacting with content.  </s>
<s> Using the conditional "if at all possible, allow time" has a weaker sound than "allow as much time as possible".  </s>
<s> Also, it's not helpful if the site gives you only five seconds to request a time extension..  </s>
<s> Also, what does it mean to "Cooperate with user agent mechanisms for preventing motion .  </s>

<s> ." in the absence of such mechanisms?  </s>
<s> I can envision a site claming that the absence of a "stop GIF animation and marquee " button in MSIE is a UA problem, and it's not the site's fault there's no UA mechanism with which to cooperate.  </s>
