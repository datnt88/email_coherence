Hello Dave Raggett, I have two problems with Tidy that I would like your advice on: (1)This is the piece of JavaScript embedded in an html script file: !-- Hide script document.write(" 
H4 ALIGN=CENTER *** Today is "+dayName[now.getDay()]+", "+monName[now.getMonth()]+" "+now.getDate()+"*** 
/H4 "); //End hiding -- This is the error mesage that Tidy gives for the line begining "document.write" 
(which is written as one long line): line 62 column 124 - Warning: ' ' + '/' + letter not allowed here The error message is refering to the end of the line containing the /H4 text. 
Can you explain whether the Javascript code is wrong or is Tidy wrong? 
My Javascript debugger has no problem with this line. 
(2) Tidy gives me this message: Warning: meta unrecognized attribute value "http-equiv" My HTML 4.0 documentation indicates that the attribute value is valid. 
Can you explain this error message? 
Thanks Rudy Kohut Script data is CDATA and therefore parsed, so a /h4 within doc.write is recognized as an endtag for a unopen h4 . 
If you check your code with http://www.htmlhelp.org/tools/validator/ 
you'll see this. 
You have to escaped this with: document.write(' 
\/h4 '); example? 
regards, Bjoern Hoehrmann This is explained in the HTML 4.0 spec. 
/ in SGML denotes the end of a CDATA element (script and style) and hence is not allowed within the contents of a script element. 
http-equiv is declared as a valid HTML4 attribute so its possible you are using an old version of Tidy. 
Does the problem go away with the latest release? 
ps. 
I am out of email contact until Aug 17 Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org
