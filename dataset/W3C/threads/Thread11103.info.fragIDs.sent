<s> By 'use it' do you mean 'use the new keyword', or 'use the catalog'?  </s>
<s> The draft wording says keywords other than public may but need not be supported by XML processors.  </s>
<s> I don't know what part of this is unclear.  </s>
<s> If you add a FREEMJET keyword to the SGML Open Catalog, the XML-lang spec does not promise you that my XML processor will be able to 'use' it in the sense of correctly doing whatever it is you want processors to do with a FREEMJET entry.  </s>
<s> If you want that promise, you need to get it on the basis of other agreements which are, perforce, outside the scope of the XML-lang spec.  </s>
<s> No, it is not.  </s>
<s> The draft wording defines a catalog file (which ought probably to be called a catalog entry file, in line with Paul Grosso's more careful terminology) as containing keywords other than PUBLIC.  </s>
<s> That means an XML processor must be able to read past them, whether it chooses to support them or not.  </s>
<s> So if you add a FREEMJET keyword to the SGML Open Catalog, the XML-lang spec does promise you that my XML processor will be able to read past the FREEMJET entries, and therefore that even processors which don't support FREEMJET (or, for that matter, CATALOG, ENTITY, DELEGATE, or any of the other keywords defined by the full SGML Open 9401 spec) will be able to use the PUBLIC entries in your catalog file (as well as any other entry types the processor supports).  </s>
<s> If there is another way to interpret the draft wording (e.g. as meaning that an XML processor is required to handle the FREEMJET keyword, or that an XML processor is allowed to signal an error on the CATALOG keyword), I would be grateful for an explanation of that other interpretation.  </s>
<s> At the moment, the draft still seems unambiguous to me.  </s>

<s> We could require conforming processors to ignore keywords that are not in the standard.  </s>
<s> Then processors that want to do something else are not strictly speaking XML processors but they are backwards compatible with them, and strict XML processors are forward compatible in a completely predictable way.  </s>

<s> Is there any real need for XML public ids to be SGML public ids?  </s>
<s> I know I'm risking being heretical here, but it occurs to me that there can be no strictly logical reason why XML public IDs should not conform to the character set restrictions of URNs (as extended in the Mainz Unicode/HTML Internationalization proposals) rather than those of SGML.  </s>
<s> Any SGML public identifier would form a valid entry according to the URN rules.  </s>
<s> It is likely that SGML will have to be revised to allow most 10646 characters at some stage in the future (though when is anyone's guess).  </s>
<s> People using systems which have an SGML parser in would be restricted to using the existing SGML restrictions on character sets until such time as SGML changes, but those simply using XML could take advantage of the advances in URN code set being proposed if they so wish.  </s>
<s> Don't we get the best of both worlds (Internationalized HTTP and old-fashioned file identification techniques) is we adopt both approaches rather than going for the lowest common denominator, the DOS 8/3 file naming conventions, that constrained the original pi character set?  </s>

<s> Just so that XML would be a legal subset of SGML, one of our stated goals.  </s>
<s> Why would we want to lose that at such a late stage in the game in order to support a non-existant standard?  </s>
