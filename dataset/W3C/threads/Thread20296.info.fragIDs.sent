<s> HI, I have been using amaya for some time.  </s>
<s> Great tool !  </s>
<s> However, I am missing something which looks like an important item : The Table of Contents.  </s>
<s> I know there is a view to it.  </s>
<s> But I could not find anywhere a way to insert it in the final HTML page.  </s>
<s> This is a little annoying as I have to use different tools for that sole purpose (like asWedit).  </s>
<s> Am I missing somthing ?  </s>
<s> If not, why can't we insert the table of contents that Amaya produces anyway ?  </s>
<s> Thank you Philippe  </s>
<s> Hi, the Table of contents is simply a particular view of the document - nothing new is generated (as far as I know).  </s>
<s> It would require some coding to add the TOC at the beginning - interested??  </s>

<s> Hi, It makes sense to have a function that generates a table of contents and links.  </s>
<s> If we have enough time, we'll provide it in the next release.  </s>
<s> Today that ToC is only display into a separated window and can be printed, but it's not added to the document's contents.  </s>
