<s> For many people a browser that renders graphics is very important.  </s>
<s> But for some, a browser that renders only text is more useful.  </s>
<s> This might be ebcause graphics can provide unwelcome distraction - there are some disabilities that affects people's ability to concentrate enough to read text if there is too much graphical material, movement, or colour with it.  </s>
<s> There are some people who do not see the graphics anyway - many people who are using speech output systems, and most people using braille display, are doing it because they are blind, so the graphics is no use to them anyway.. If a text-based browser is otherwise more useful (faster, better interface, etc) then it makes sense to use one.  </s>
<s> In fact for certain features the text-based browsers provide better access to the information that is encoded in the page than the combination of a graphical browser and speech technology.  </s>
<s> But this changes all the time - there are new browsers available most weeks.  </s>
<s> For some people it is also a restriction of their device, or effectively required for speed.  </s>
<s> When I am not able to connect with a line faster than 9600 baud I tend not to be interested in downloading graphics content.  </s>
<s> I use  </s>
<s> lynx or links, both of which give a much better presentation for my needs than a graphics browser that has the graphics turned off.  </s>
<s> (And I attach all kinds of media players to them so I can choose which images to download easily, or which audio to listen to.) just my 2c worth Charles McCN Vadim Plessky asked, at BTW: what are advantages if using text-based browser?  </s>
<s> I really do not understand that.  </s>

<s> Charles, thanks a lot for clarification!  </s>
<s> Of course, blind people do not need graphics being send over internet connection, it's just waste of time and bandwidth.  </s>
<s> My point was that you can always disable images (via menu or via CSS: img { display: none !important } ) when you don't need them.  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> But that should also disable rendering of the text alternatives, and very often I do need those.  </s>
<s> Lynx and links and emacs/W3 hhave good ways of getting at the text altternative content, compared to graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> Now let's think about somebody who has visual disability (say, miopia, in -10..-5 range) and wants to use web.  </s>
<s> It will be quite logical to use *graphical* browser for a such person, and in addition *to increase font size* for all pages.  </s>
<s> Absolutely true.  </s>
<s> For most people it is important to have a graphical capability.  </s>
<s> Even when I use a text browser, I have it configured to be able to show images if I think I need them.  </s>

<s> I interviewed a lot of people about mobile communication (mostly - General Managers or other top-level managers), and most of them replied that they do not need it [ "I use phone to make calls, that's it"].  </s>
<s> I know that this can sound very different from, say, Gartner reports - but I prefer to trust to real-world reports, not to synthetic ones.  </s>
<s> So, WAP is not excuse here at all.  </s>
<s> I don't think the issue of whether WAP as a format is any good is the same as the issue of whether people use mobile devices - many people I know use mobile devices to get access for their normal services, and it is slow.  </s>
<s> I don't think we can force "them" to adopt SVG in any area, but I think it is happening anyway.  </s>

<s> Well bandwidth may be a problem for some people using non mobile devices.  </s>
<s> Until last year the Perth Observatory int he hills outside perth about 20 km from the city centre op Perth Western Australia could only get about 5000 baud connections due to the old exchange.  </s>
<s> The introduction of satelite could have improved this now but as satelite requires an uplink by modem I dont know if it applies anywhere else.  </s>

<s> Therefor, another question comes here in mind: shouldn't we force usage of Icons (SVG icons/drawings, in particular, in such small devices)?  </s>
<s> And, as for blind people - something "beeping" or making other sounds in the kitchen makes much more sense than coffee-maker machine with text-based browsing interface (wether it has Lynx built-in or not, doesn' t matter much)  </s>
