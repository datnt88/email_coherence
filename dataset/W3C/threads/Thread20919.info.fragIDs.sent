Hi, is there any way how to use BibTeX while writing an article in Amaya? 
I 
meant some program which would pick some tags (not sure, what they would be a directed towards some particular document?) and replace them with proper citations in the natbib style and create a list of references in the end of the document. 
Thanks for any ideas, Matej Cepl

I guess batch tools able to convert BibTeX into HTML should exist.

Well, that's not what I meant -- I thought more about some kind of BibTeX replacement which instead of LaTeX document worked with XHTML document, went through the document, picked up all references cited, get citations and references from BibTeX database, and put them back into the document. 
What bib2html does (and many other script of this kind) is that it goes through all BibTeX database and covert it to HTML page. 
I thought about something much more sophisticated. 
Oh well. 
Thanks for the answer though, Matej Matej Cepl, http://www.ceplovi.cz/matej
