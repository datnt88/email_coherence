A small point: 3.5.2. 
When using the OBJECT element, specify alternative text within the "title" attribute or within the body of the OBJECT element. 
I think there needs to be more of a description here of why you want to put text in the title vs. the body of the object. 
Josh Krieger CAST Further to Josh's comment, why should the textual alternative be included in the TITLE attribute of OBJECT? 
If I remember the HTML 4.0 specification correctly, an empty OBJECT element (one that contains no content) is not permitted. 
Thus, the guideline should state that the alternative text belongs in the content of OBJECT, and that authors may wish to include a brief label for the resource in the TITLE attribute. 
Some user agents may simply present the title, and leave it to the user's discretion to decide whether to read the more detailed text which is included in the content of OBJECT. 
LQ:: It shouldn't. 
The TITLE gives a title for the OBJECT, just as TITLE does with any other element. 
Alternative text is not a title. 
JW:: LQ:: OBJECT can have no content, as in the following example: A content-free OBJECT would be appropriate when embedding a purely decorative object--there is no alternative content because the object is not content. 
JW:: LQ:: Agreed.
