Highlights from June 13 telecon: 1.Cynthia, Paul and Wendy's proposal (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/05/cp1-2.html) for checkpoint 1.2, was reviewed with discussion focusing primarily on edits to the minimum level success criteria. 
A new draft of the proposal based on the discussion can be reviewed at 2.Gregg and Ben are working on a new checkpoint for Guideline 1 that is focused on providing information needed for unambiguous decoding of the characters and words in content. 
The new checkpoint will address the issue of missing vowel marks (such as in Hebrew) and will incorporate discussion of character set remapping (text must map back to (whatever international group says) character set) 3.New Issues (tracked with experimental issue tracking tool): *Accessible rebroadcasts (see *Character encoding (see *real-time or interactive presentation and deaf-blindness (see *checkpoint (or definition) about use of standard character set (see http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/issues.php3/wai/wcag/?issues_id=648) 4.(General Comment) In discussing the checkpoint 1.2 proposal, John Slatin suggested that we should avoid using language that ensures that the user can achieve the author's intention. 
Instead, we should say that the author has provided an equivalent that achieves the purpose of the content. 
I started to write an email to suggest a change to the wording of the exception statement under minimum success criteria #2, but then realized that I wasn't so sure about the appropriateness of my recommendation, so I'm instead asking for opinions on the matter in general. 
Right now, the exception statement says that dialogue and sounds do not have to be synchronously captioned in an audio-only format, and if the content is not time-sensitive and not interactive. 
Here is my question: would the same exception apply to video content under some circumstances? 
For example, if you have a video clip that doesn't have a lot of content that is particularly visual in nature (e.g. a video clip of a professor giving a lecture while standing at a podium), I don't see a compelling reason to add synchronous captions at a minimum conformance level. 
It seems to me that a transcript would be sufficient. 
At level 2 or 3, I think we can be justified in saying that the video ought to have synchronous captions, but at a minimum level, I just don't think it's necessary. 
Maybe we could say something like this (this is wordy, but it has all of the elements): "Exception: For non-interactive, non-time-sensitive, real-time Web content which is primarily or exclusively audio-based, a transcript or other non-audio equivalent is sufficient." 
NOTE: I also think that the phrase "transcript or other non-audio equivalent" should be changed to reflect the idea of using a standard character set in a text-based format, as per the teleconference discussion, but I didn't know how to word it, so I left it as is for now.

Instead, we should say that the author has provided an equivalent that achieves the purpose of the content. 
I have a concern with the exception statement under #6 of the revised proposals for 1.2 minimum conformance criteria (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/17-cp1-2.html). 
It currently states: "exception: if content is rebroadcast from another medium or resource that complies to broadcast requirements for accessibility (independent of these guidelines), the rebroadcast satisfies the checkpoint if it complies with the other guidelines." 
I agree with this idea in principle. 
But there is a particular aspect which isn't being addressed. 
If you've ever seen a rebroadcast of a captioned television program over the web in a 150 by 150 pixel media player (or sometimes even smaller), you may have had trouble reading the captions (no matter how good your vision is). 
The resolution of these videos is, of course, dependent upon the size of the video, the quality and file size of the source file, etc. 
It seems to me that we need a caveat in the statement, to ensure that the captions are legible when rebroadcast on the web. 
We could keep the statement as it is and add qualifying statements about the viewing size and/or resolution of the video, or about the size of font in pixels, or something like that. 
I'm not sure exactly how to fix the statement, but I think that the issue needs to be addressed in it somehow. 
Developers would usually have the ability to create a file of different resolutions and/or sizes, and at least one of the versions could be larger, with a high-enough resolution so that the readability of the captions is more likely. 
I know that this then gets into issues of bandwidth, the user's technology constraints (e.g. slow connection) and so on, but the bottom line is this: What good are captions if you can't read them?

As a clarification, captions made in SMIL or SAMI for media players are inherently more legible than the captions that come second-hand through non-web broadcasts. 
SMIL and SAMI captions can be as legible as any real text on the person's computer. 
Captions that are a part of rebroadcasts often end up being pixilated, blocky, and blurry.

I have two reservations about this. 
One is the technical one identified by Paul. 
The other is that it is unmeasurable as it gives no guideance as to what standards might be applicable. 
Is it fair to claim, for example, that some rebroadcast audio complied to the accessibility standard for Fighter Pilot commmunication with their controllers and therefore needs no captioning? 
Does this apply to a legal requirement that has been met or to some defined requirements for ensuring accessibility?
