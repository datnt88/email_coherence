<s> Pat, just to let you know that I am now too tired to write up my scribblings.  </s>
<s> There were no issues that I saw as critical.  </s>
<s> I have got a number of typos etc.  </s>
<s> I have one large deletion (the graph syntax bit).  </s>
<s> I have some discussion points about other overlap with concepts (assertions, datatypes, rdfs:XMLLiteral - that last one is close to critical, but all that means is I like my text about XML much more than yours, so that's subjective really) I have a suggestion for restructuring and strengthening the recommendations made to people extending the rdf collection and rdf reificiation vocabularies.  </s>
<s> However, I will send details tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Sorry to keep you in suspense.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Sorry I am out of time now - I am travelling today, I won't be on the net tomorrow, so other than the recommended thing I suspect my typos etc will just have to wait.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> If they are only typos I may catch them.  </s>
<s> I plan to spend monday doing copyediting and HTML polishing.  </s>
