<s> I am for neutrality on this.  </s>
<s> In other words, check nothing and leave it up to the user to decide what they want checked.  </s>
<s> Not only does this prevent entering accidental data, it also prevents entering optional data if the user wishes to do that.  </s>
<s> When you check something, you are apparently making assumptions about your users.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what the reasoning is for having something checked by default but I also support the use of combo boxes where ever possible with the item at the box being a null item.  </s>
<s> If something needs to be chosen and nothing has been chosen, submission should inform the user that this needs to be done before acceptance will be granted and this also should be done within the form to help cut down on non submission of critical data.  </s>
<s> So, while I think the null approach is best, I could be persuaded by cogent arguments against my position being aware that I have been using assistive technology for around 30 years.  </s>

<s> That would be my stance too but... (... but it doesn't get the logo which some people seem to think is important) Could anyone provide combinations of user agents/AT which won't recognise that the form control is there if a place holder is not present (or present other problems).  </s>

<s> I think they can all cope, they are just not required to cope in the same way.  </s>
<s> I believe, you will find that if you read on from the quote, you will find that the earlier preferred action was to select the first item in the list, which is not, I think, the behaviour you want.  </s>
