Based on today's discussion [1] I revised the charter [2] and timeline [3]. 
The major changes in the charter and timeline: 1. the testing procedures are not a deliverable but a matter of how we work. 
therefore it has been removed from the list of deliverables and the timeline, but we mention testing where we discuss the Techniques document. 
2. the impact matrix is not longer a deliverable but mentioned as a supporting document of the Guidelines since it could get incorporated into the guidelines either per checkpoint or as an appendix. 
we don't want to promise an extra deliverable. 
3. in the coordination section, we mention mobile and I18N explicitly and have pulled the piece about CG out into the intro (it was in the paragraph about PF). 
I would like to send the charter to the Director next week. 
Please post comments before next Wednesday (December 22). 
Note that the timeline and end of charter report [4] are supporting materials for the charter, thus I would also like comments on them before Wednesday as well. 
Thanks,

Wendy, The charter looks good to me. 
Suggestions: 
1. Add MathML to the list of technologies techniques would be developed 
2. Would it highlight accessible scripting techniques to give it it's own bullet

The charter looks fine although I'm not entirely satisfied that 5.User Agent Support for Accessibility (W3C Note) should be a "deliverable". 
As to the timelines I suggest that so long as everything claimed as a "deliverable" is included, everyone will understand that the dates are, to say the least, flexible. 
On the whole they seem optimistically dated judging by the alt="" fiasco grin 
My only comment on the end-charter report is "well done". 
Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
done. 
hmm, I don't think this is necessary. 
can you give me a compelling argument?

William, 
Is this because of the discussion from Thursday's call that the User Agent Support page could be wrapped into the test suite for Techniques? 
If it is not a deliverable on its own, we could include it in the list of supporting documents for the next release of the WCAG. 
The other thing, is that Ian and I are working on a draft of this document. 
The information we gather could be included in the Techniques test suite once it is created. 
Therefore, if we're going to have something anyway, why not list it as a deliverable? 
Something has to be generated to support WCAG1.0, but the next version might have a different form of support, OR no need for a user agent support page. 
thoughts? 
Thanks to Chuck Letourneau for writing the majority of it!

Scripting is a hot topic in web development and in websites today (the sydeny olympics webiste, which went into court recently, was a problem preciesely because it relied on scripting for basic funtionality) There is a lot of scripting out there, and some active work in trying to make scripting an accessible exercise.

Wendy, I think things like scripting and XSLT are about transforming information. 
Transformation can include rendering content on a specific medium like a graphical display. 
This seems fundamentally different then representing the information in a document format like HTML, XML, SMIL or MathML. 
Therefore a separate line in the charter would highlight this difference.
