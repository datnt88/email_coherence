<s> Based on today's discussion [1] I revised the charter [2] and timeline [3].  </s>
<s> The major changes in the charter and timeline: 1. the testing procedures are not a deliverable but a matter of how we work.  </s>
<s> therefore it has been removed from the list of deliverables and the timeline, but we mention testing where we discuss the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> 2. the impact matrix is not longer a deliverable but mentioned as a supporting document of the Guidelines since it could get incorporated into the guidelines either per checkpoint or as an appendix.  </s>
<s> we don't want to promise an extra deliverable.  </s>
<s> 3. in the coordination section, we mention mobile and I18N explicitly and have pulled the piece about CG out into the intro (it was in the paragraph about PF).  </s>
<s> I would like to send the charter to the Director next week.  </s>
<s> Please post comments before next Wednesday (December 22).  </s>
<s> Note that the timeline and end of charter report [4] are supporting materials for the charter, thus I would also like comments on them before Wednesday as well.  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>

<s> Wendy, The charter looks good to me.  </s>
<s> Suggestions:  </s>
<s> 1. Add MathML to the list of technologies techniques would be developed  </s>
<s> 2. Would it highlight accessible scripting techniques to give it it's own bullet  </s>

<s> The charter looks fine although I'm not entirely satisfied that 5.User Agent Support for Accessibility (W3C Note) should be a "deliverable".  </s>
<s> As to the timelines I suggest that so long as everything claimed as a "deliverable" is included, everyone will understand that the dates are, to say the least, flexible.  </s>
<s> On the whole they seem optimistically dated judging by the alt="" fiasco grin  </s>
<s> My only comment on the end-charter report is "well done".  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
<s> hmm, I don't think this is necessary.  </s>
<s> can you give me a compelling argument?  </s>

<s> William,  </s>
<s> Is this because of the discussion from Thursday's call that the User Agent Support page could be wrapped into the test suite for Techniques?  </s>
<s> If it is not a deliverable on its own, we could include it in the list of supporting documents for the next release of the WCAG.  </s>
<s> The other thing, is that Ian and I are working on a draft of this document.  </s>
<s> The information we gather could be included in the Techniques test suite once it is created.  </s>
<s> Therefore, if we're going to have something anyway, why not list it as a deliverable?  </s>
<s> Something has to be generated to support WCAG1.0, but the next version might have a different form of support, OR no need for a user agent support page.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>
<s> Thanks to Chuck Letourneau for writing the majority of it!  </s>

<s> Scripting is a hot topic in web development and in websites today (the sydeny olympics webiste, which went into court recently, was a problem preciesely because it relied on scripting for basic funtionality) There is a lot of scripting out there, and some active work in trying to make scripting an accessible exercise.  </s>

<s> Wendy, I think things like scripting and XSLT are about transforming information.  </s>
<s> Transformation can include rendering content on a specific medium like a graphical display.  </s>
<s> This seems fundamentally different then representing the information in a document format like HTML, XML, SMIL or MathML.  </s>
<s> Therefore a separate line in the charter would highlight this difference.  </s>
