<s> Hello, The Web Services internationalization usage scenarios document was nearly cleaned up.  </s>
<s> Please take a look at it.  </s>
<s> URL: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/  </s>
<s> If you find problems, please send comments to the mailing list: public-i18n-ws@w3.org.  </s>

<s> Hello Kentaro, Many thanks for all your work.  </s>
<s> I saw that you worked quite a bit on the 'Status of this Document' section.  </s>
<s> The main piece that we still need there is the invitation for sending in use cases.  </s>
<s> (more or less the same thing that we will say in the announcement that we plan to send to various lists).  </s>
<s> Addison, I think you said that you would work on that.  </s>
<s> Do you have a draft that we could include?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello Kentaro, I have done a little bit more work on the document.  </s>
<s> Here are the main things I have done: - Removed "Editorial comments are noted as "ednote"."  </s>
<s> in status section.  </s>
<s> Editorial comments are marked well enough.  </s>
<s> - In the sentence "This document specifies a variety of Web Services internationalization usage scenarios and use cases."  </s>
<s> (both in the abstract and in the intro), changed 'specifies' to 'describes'.  </s>
<s> I'm also thinking about a grouping of the scenarios into several chapters, to help readers.  </s>
<s> Now that we use XML, it may be easier  </s>
<s> to do it without too much work (once we have figured out what the groups are; some of them, such as language negotiation, are pretty clear, while others are not).  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello Martin, Thank you for your work.  </s>
<s> It looks very nice.  </s>
<s> It is good idea.  </s>
<s> I had a try, and uploaded the document.  </s>
<s> Could you please check it?  </s>
<s> If you have other categorization or chapter title, please modify the document.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kentaroh Kentaroh Noji : nojik@jp.ibm.com  </s>
<s> Hello Addison,  </s>
<s> I saw that you worked quite a bit on the 'Status of this Document'  </s>
<s> section.  </s>
<s> I added the "Status of this document" in the style of other W3C documents.  </s>
<s> I would like to replace the draft of "Status of this document" with the new version you have drafted.  </s>
<s> Please post your draft.  </s>
