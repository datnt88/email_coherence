Four suggestions, first two for now, then two for later. 
individual markers: Authors that consider the content of their site to be primarily graphical, are advised to provide an icon to be used by third parties as a link to that site. 
meta markers: These authors are further advised that an icon (with link) of their choice, indicating a topic area should be provided. 
photos: Could HTML incorporate an image tag indicating that the content was royalty free? 
links: It would be helpful if links indicated whether they were to content of a similiar type. 
It is important to be aware that image producers would want to retain copyright in case their images were used in a grossly defamatory way. 
To have offending sites removed from the www where possible. 
Obviously problems arise where people post the images of others as their own. 
This is common to all media. 
Conceiving and formulating guidlines is well beyond my normal duties as you will be aware.

JC:: "Conceiving and formulating guidlines is well beyond my normal duties" WL: The instant posting belies this assertion since it makes clear (at last?) that your conception facilities are in order. 
The hashing out of the language of the guidelines/checkpoints may not be your cup of tea but you have made some concrete proposals that could lead to actions with a chance to make the Web more accessible. 
As to this being your "duty" - it is of course the "duty" of all participants in this "thing of ours" (Cosa Nostra? 
g ) to move towards the (unachievable?) goal of everything, everyone connected. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
I have been watching this with great interest. 
Do any of you know Keenan Weller in Canada? 
He has been working on this for a while. 
I don t have valid email for him. 
However he comes to the ISOC meetings sometimes and I will look for him later this month.
