<s> Hello, Per the teleconf today [1], here's a proposal to clarify 4.16.  </s>
<s> 4.16 Allow the user to configure viewports, prompts, and windows opened on user agent initiation.  </s>
<s> 4.16 Allow the user to configure viewports, prompts, and windows that open indirectly, that is by any means other than the user opening them explicitly.  </s>
<s> Note the similarity to the wording of 9.2: 9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly, that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit form submit control.  </s>
<s> Please voice any objections this afternoon (New York time).  </s>

<s> Ian, How about: 4.16 Allow the user to configure the opening of viewports, prompts, and windows that are not the direct result of an explicit user request  </s>
