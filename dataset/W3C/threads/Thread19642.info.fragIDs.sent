<s> I just download amaya-src-1.0a.tar and thot-src-2.1a.tar and started to build it with gcc-make 3.75 and gcc-2.7.2.1 on a DECstation 5000/200 with Ultrix 4.4.  </s>
<s> 1) I had to build the dependent libraries individually (jpeg, png, zlib, www) as the makefile fails without any obvious error.  </s>
<s> I'm not to worried about this.  </s>
<s> 2) The Ultrix 'ar' does not accept filenames over 15 characters.  </s>
<s> The filenames are being truncated: ar: Info: filename presentationapi.o  </s>
<s> truncated to presentationapi  </s>
<s> 3) And finally when 'making' amaya, I get this: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/ld: /lib/libX11.a(XKeyBind.o):  </s>

<s> Ok, not really a problem.  </s>
<s> This is harmless,  </s>
<s> That's a glitch to be abble to imput ISO-Latin chars in Motif dialogs the same way as it's done in the standard text.  </s>
<s> Edit Thot/amaya/EDITOR.A, and remove teh use of the Lookup package USES HTML, Lookup, NoStructSelect to USES HTML, NoStructSelect and restart make amaya.  </s>
<s> It should recompile the dialogue schemas and most of the C files, and hopefully finish the link, This is explained in the compiling guideline for Amaya at section If make failed: Subsection an error occured at link time: Item 6 If amaya linking complains about XLookupString hope this help, Daniel Daniel Veillard@w3.org | W3C / INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Daniel.Veillard@inrialpes.fr| 655 av de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, Java, Tel : +33 04 76 61 53 85 | 38330 Montbonnot | badminton, Kaffe, Home: +33 04 76 63 05 86 | http://opera.inrialpes.fr/veillard  </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response.  </s>
<s> As suggested, I removed the 'Lookup' from Thot/amaya/EDITOR.A.  </s>
<s> However, I still get the same link error: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/ld: /lib/libX11.a(XKeyBind.o):  </s>
<s> XLookupString: multiply defined make: *** [/users/ftp/Thot/DEC/bin/amaya] Error 1 This still happens even if I remove and rebuild eveything from the tar.gz files again, edit EDITOR.A and do a "make" and "make amaya".  </s>
