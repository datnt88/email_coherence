<s> 21 June 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference Agenda announcement: Minutes of previous meeting 7 June: Present: Ian Jacobs (Chair), Mickey Quenzer, Harvey Bingham, David Poehlman, Tim Lacy Regrets: Jon Gunderson, Jim Allan Next meeting: 28 June Regrets from Harvey, Mickey for this meeting.  </s>
<s> Reference document 4 June 2001 Guidelines: Discussion 1) Update on last call * Processing SVG WG comments.  </s>
<s> Should be done in a couple of weeks.  </s>
<s> * Next step: CR. Preparation - implementation report, goals of CR. Schedule banter: - Go to CR on 19 July.  </s>
<s> - Not sure about duration of CR (we have to show implementation of each feature in some piece of software).  </s>
<s> - Not clear what would happen if we dropped substantial requirements at a result of finding in CR that some pieces cannot be implemented.  </s>
<s> 2) Publication of revised UAAG 1.0 on TR page?  </s>
<s> Request from Ian: Resolved: - Publish newer UAAG 1.0 (4 June draft) on TR page.  </s>
<s> Action IJ: Request publication of newer UAAG 1.0 (4 June draft).  </s>
<s> 3) Face-to-face meeting in September Possibly with other WAI WGs at Microsoft: - Sept 5, 6, 7, (Weds - Fri) - Sept 10 - 14 (Mon - Fri) TL: I'll be there.  </s>
<s> grin IJ: Me too.  </s>
<s> I think no problem for either date at this time.  </s>
<s> MQ: Me too.  </s>
<s> No date prefs.  </s>
<s> DP: Me too.  </s>
<s> No date prefs.  </s>
<s> HB: Possible, can't promise.  </s>
<s> Action IJ: Continue to keep WG informed of meeting plans.  </s>
<s> HB: What are expectations for ftf?  </s>
<s> IJ: We should be in the middle of CR. 4) Review of responses to SVG WG last call comments.  </s>
<s> Refer to document: IJ: General comment - applicability not understood.  </s>
<s> Since spec has been split into pieces, it might be possible to move the conformance section before the guidelines again.  </s>
<s> Or just put a brief explanation of applicability up front.  </s>
<s> For B.1: Add xml namespaces as an example of something that might not be recognized.  </s>
<s> TL: Analyzing a document for scripts is not an unreasonable burden.  </s>
<s> The analysis would be one API call.  </s>
<s> For IE, we build a number of trees.  </s>
<s> It is one API call to ask whether there's an element "foo" anywhere in this tree?  </s>
<s> IJ: They may have understood the requirement to be one alert per script element.  </s>
<s> We only require one alert, and the search can stop as soon as one is identified.  </s>
<s> For B.2: Checkpoint 4.2: Control of font families burdensome in SVG IJ: I'm not sure what "fonts for graphics" means.  </s>
<s> We might need to clarify whether the SVG WG understands fonts to include "pictures of letters" (with no characters behind them).  </s>
<s> We may have to state that we mean fonts as pictures/vectors that are applied to text characters.  </s>
<s> For C.1: Too many Priority 1 checkpoints IJ: I'm not favorable to adding another level.  </s>
<s> It would be significant work (and fighting) that we've already done.  </s>
<s> MQ: Maybe we need to make clearer that the "Who Benefits" sections are there.  </s>
<s> We don't want to ignore certain groups of users with disabilities.  </s>
<s> This would help explain why so many checkpoints.  </s>
<s> You might also point to the impact matrix from the introduction.  </s>
<s> Action IJ: - Add a link to "How People with Disabilities use the Web" from the section on the impact matrix.  </s>
<s> - Add reference to this document even though it's not yet a note.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Do not increase granularity.  </s>
<s> Do not remove checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Do not lower priorities.  </s>
<s> Rationale: We have this many checkpoints to address cross-disability concerns.  </s>
<s> Who do you exclude?  </s>
<s> Were we to re-evaluate checkpoint priority, we would have to return to step one.  </s>
<s> We have spent years on the conformance model and establishing priorities.  </s>
<s> - Demonstrate implementability in CR. DP: A lot of the changes that the SVG WG is recommending are very sweeping.  </s>
<s> I am not sure that they understand the rationale for the development of UAAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> You might point them to "Hurdles of UA Guidelines" DP: Our process of developing the Guidelines has gone through these questions a number of times (e.g., whether something should be a checkpoint).  </s>
<s> /* Discussions of other paragraphs not minuted, as they were just comments on the draft proposal.  </s>
<s> Ian is editing the draft proposal in place.  </s>
<s> */ C.6: Don't require keyboard access for all functionalities (e.g., text selection, region positioning) IJ: I wonder whether there's some exception that can be carved out here.  </s>
<s> There's some tight binding between input and output modes in the case of drawing.  </s>
<s> Can we capture this?  </s>
<s> Do we want to?  </s>
<s> IJ: I have this sense that when a functionality is bound to a particular output mode (e.g., drawing is inherently visual), then our input mode requirements might be different.  </s>
<s> Why would we require input mode independence when a particular functionality depends on a single output mode?  </s>
<s> MQ: I want to be able to show people a set of slides, even though I may not be able to use the slides.  </s>
<s> There are blind people who can visual what they're doing (e.g., drawing).  </s>
<s> DP: I need to be able to teach my students how to use a drawing tool.  </s>
<s> I need to be able to say "This is how you change the brush width", even though I may not be able to see the results.  </s>
<s> Or I need to be able to document this functionality (if I work for a software company).  </s>
<s> DP: I may not be able to use a mouse, but I may not be blind.  </s>
<s> I may have a physical disability and be using a large keyboard.  </s>
<s> IJ: How do you answer the question: Some things, like drawing, are hard to do with the keyboard?  </s>
<s> I think the important distinction is between two-dimensional input and one-dimensional input.  </s>
<s> IJ: It would be useful to distinguish three cases: - Direct access (i.e., spatially-independent) required for some users, e.g., with blindness.  </s>
<s> In this case, keyboard shortcuts make the most sense.  </s>
<s> - Keyboard, not mouse, access required for other users (e.g., using specialized input devices that make use of the keyboard API, or for whom moving arrow keys is easier than a mouse, for example).  </s>
<s> In this case, keyboard shortcuts are not as sensible.  </s>
<s> This is not to say that no drawing is easy to do with direct access; it's probably easy for well-known shapes, flipping them, enlarging them, etc.  </s>
<s> But for some other functionalities, such as free-hand drawing.  </s>
<s> IJ: MouseKeys may be the best solution for some functionalities, but should not be relied on for all access (for those who cannot use spatially-dependent input mechanisms).  </s>
<s> DP: Another important issue is that APIs are important for alternative input devices.  </s>
<s> Action IJ: Clarify for 1.1. the difference between spatially-dependent and independent access through the keyboard.  </s>
<s> We don't require all functionalities be available in a spatially-independent manner.  </s>
<s> Where possible, provide at least a spatially-independent input mechanism.  </s>
<s> Access through the keyboard API will be useful to AT developers.  </s>
<s> Action items (open) 1.IJ: Coordinate usability testing of the guidelines (JRG volunteers to be one of the testers).  </s>
<s> Source: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0137 5.RS: Send pointer to information about universal access gateway to the WG.  </s>
<s> Source: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0258 6.GR: Review event checkpoints for techniques 7.GR: Rewrite different markup (list of elements) that 2.9 applies to, for clarification.  </s>

<s> AG:: I don't believe that is the problem.  </s>
<s> SVG takes pains to help people not create pictures of text without providing the text too.  </s>
<s> Their fonts are fonts.  </s>
<s> It sounds like there is something here we didn't understand well enought to think about it.  </s>
<s> You will have to ask them to get the real skinny on what is burdensome about it, but it is quite plausible that substituting an arbitrary system font family for an SVG-defined font, for example, may be a bear.  </s>
<s> For example text laid out on a pennant blowing in the wind depends on there being a certain plasticity in the definition of the font.  </s>
<s> If you don't have a scalable vector definition of the font, you could be simply out of luck.  </s>
<s> Some of the system fonts could be defined on a bitmap basis and not be amenable to smooth deformation as required for this use.  </s>
<s> On the other hand they may have degrees of freedom which will have the same assistive effect but aren't called 'family.' If the glyphs of the font are being vector-drawn, there is a low level primitive line weight or width parameter in the drawing, perhaps.  </s>
<s> If that could be made manipulable for selected text ranges, one would have something comparable to a controllable degree of "bold in place" effect, without any change in the macroscopic layout of the text.  </s>
<s> Like what is produced with the darkness adjust on a photocopier.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Just a rough note, that the folks in the AU and WCAG groups at the face to face meetings were interested in next meetings the week of 10-14 september around there.  </s>

<s> for freehand drawing keyboard access essentially amounts to mousekeys anyway.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if thre is anything else that isn't amenable to keyboard manipulation - moving graphics, resizing and transforming are often useful things to do via the keyboard.  </s>
<s> In the olden days, this was even a commmon thing to do.  </s>
<s> Are there specific things that are considered too difficult?  </s>

<s> - Checkpoint 1.1 says this, but doesnt distinguish whether the way you accomplish something through the keyboard must be spatially-independent (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, menu navigation) or may be spatially-dependent (e.g., moving the pointing device via the keyboard).  </s>
<s> - We should not try to make 1.1 any more precise than it is, and we should: a) Emphasize that spatially-independent access should be provided (perhaps redundant with spatially-dependent methods) where possible.  </s>
<s> This would include text selection, moving graphics, etc. b) Ensure that we explain that keyboard access is not just for users with blindness, and some users with physical disabilities will find spatially-dependent keyboard access useful, as will users with alternative input devices who make use of the keyboard API.  </s>
<s> This will be reflected in the next draft.  </s>
