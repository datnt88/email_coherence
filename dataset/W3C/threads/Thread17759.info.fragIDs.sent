<s> Allow the user to trigger events in a device-independent manner.  </s>
<s> Weak vote for native.  </s>
<s> If someone provides a clear example in favor of Compatibility I might change opinions.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 4.1.15]  </s>
<s> When new windows or user interface components are spawned, allow the user to override author-designated changes to window size.  </s>
<s> Strong vote for native.  </s>
<s> Much easier to implement natively than through a third party.  </s>
<s> Can lead to sever loss of accessibility when a spawned window covers a needed accessibility aid on the screen, or moves some interface objects off the screen because the window  </s>
<s> is larger than the screen, for someone using a headwand, for instance.  </s>

<s> Technique: 4.3.1]  </s>
<s> Allow users to specify that a page be formatted linearly.  </s>
<s> No strong opinion [Technique: 4.3.2]  </s>
<s> Allow users to specify that a table be formatted linearly.  </s>
<s> No strong opinion.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.2.5] Keep track of the user's point of regard in each view and put it within the viewport when the user returns to the view.  </s>
<s> Native.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.3.1]  </s>
<s> Alert the user when scripts are executed.  </s>
<s> How about: Give the user the option of being notified when scripts are executed.  </s>
<s> [Native]  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.3.2]  </s>
<s> Provide information about document changes resulting from the execution of a script.  </s>
<s> I'm not clear on what the implications of this are, or how this could be done.  </s>
<s> Should it say "Provide notification when a document changes due to script execution"?  </s>
<s> Or is it supposed to give specific info on what kind of change has taken place?  </s>
<s> If the latter, there needs to be some clearer definition of what is expected.  </s>
<s> Also, isn't this listed as Priority 3 in the Nov 12 doc?  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.3.3]  </s>
<s> Allow users to be prompted before spawning a new window.  </s>
<s> Native.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.5.3]  </s>
<s> Provide a mechanism for designating the current table of a document.  </s>
<s> To be honest, I'm not sure what is meant by 'designate' in this context.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.5.4]  </s>
<s> Provide a mechanism for designating the current cell of a table.  </s>
<s> Not sure of meaning of 'designate' in this instance either.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.5.5]  </s>
<s> Allow the user to navigate among tables in a document.  </s>
<s> Native.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 5.5.6]  </s>
<s> Allow the user to navigate among table cells of the current table (notably left/right within a row and up/down within a column).  </s>

<s> a few footnotes to follow up on what Paul Adelson said:  </s>
<s> This technique requires a handshake.  </s>
<s> The browser cannot do it without some cooperation from the AT and vice versa.  </s>
<s> How about: Give the user {quiet, alert, confirm} options governing script execution  </s>
<s> This blends into the above technique.  </s>
<s> What matters is the impact of the script.  </s>
<s> If the user wants to review/confirm prior to letting the script execute, it has to be caught prior to execution.  </s>
<s> How to communicate what will happen is tougher.  </s>
<s> On alert to offer the option of communicating what changed is easier.  </s>
<s> There are plenty of tricks of the trade such as a transient select on the least document subtree enclosing the change.  </s>
<s> This is extending the "confirm" meta-control to all new-window transactions.  </s>
<s> This has to do with the assumed state model.  </s>
<s> Is there a cross-platform definition of select, focus, etc. that we can build on?  </s>
<s> "Current table" probably combines some of the characteristics of "select" and "system caret."  </s>
<s> Need to worry about whether the state of the tabbing cycle moves, too.  </s>
<s> Likewise for table cells.  </s>
<s> Need to define the "current" state operationally.  </s>

<s> Using a headwand instead of a mouse, or every 2 hands, I lack the flexibility to timely deal with new elements.  </s>

<s> For a month I've turned allow new window Off in Opera as an experiment to see what impact spawning had on my Web experience.  </s>
<s> I was even amazed myself how much easier it is to work with no spawning.  </s>
<s> Using Page Back &amp; Next is very much more effective [grin] Regards, Bryan - Life is a beta test.  </s>
<s> We mustn't let software companies add unnecessary quizzes!  </s>
