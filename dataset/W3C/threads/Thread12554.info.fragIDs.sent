<s> FIRST DRAFT!  </s>
<s> A government, company or organization's failure to provide Universal Accessibility on the web is a serious impediment to their ability to provide  </s>
<s> information, services or products to over 54 million People With Disabilities (PWD).  </s>
<s> For example, if: * An e-commerce web site is not accessible to PWDs, the business has just lost an immediate customer and potential customers.  </s>
<s> * An organization or Federal, State or local Government does not provide access to its information, then they are not providing a public service.  </s>
<s> * A city does not provide bus routes in an accessible format, then PWDs cannot check the schedule, especially if the office closes at 5PM.  </s>
<s> * A library does not have the staffed trained to support public computers or  </s>
<s> internet terminals, then they cannot effectively serve the local community.  </s>
<s> The web provides information, products and services to people through the Internet, Intranets, or Extranets.  </s>
<s> Computers have enabled people to function  </s>
<s> at home or at work, and study, train, or surf the web for information.  </s>
<s> Computers have also opened up the world to enable PWDs to be productive at home or work - the office now has no boundaries.  </s>
<s> The web and other assistive devices have also enabled PWDs to us computers to be productive.  </s>
<s> More importantly, through the web, the world has no boundaries.  </s>
<s> We can now learn about another city, culture, or train schedule from the web.  </s>
<s> Whereas,  </s>
<s> the web has facilitated access to information, e-mail has expanded our  </s>
<s> exchange of ideas and friendships.  </s>
<s> We can now communicate to a larger audience, rather than by a single telephone call or a teleconference call.  </s>
<s> We no longer need a dedicated office for the web and email - just a computer  </s>
<s> and connectivity to the internet.  </s>
<s> There are two policies that address accessibility of information for PWDs under Federal, State, and local government, Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) and Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, Section 508.  </s>
<s> While ADA references State and local governments, Section 508 establishes requirement that federal government, and by extension through the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, information technology that is accessible.  </s>
<s> There is a relevant opinion issued by the US DOJ in September, 1996, "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and local governments and places of public accommodation to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the program or service or in an undue burden..." Section 508 states under (1) Accessibility: (A) Development, procurement, maintenance, or use of electronic and information technology: When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, each Federal department or agency, including the United States Postal Service, shall ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the department or agency, that the electronic and  </s>
<s> information technology allows, regardless of the type of medium of the technology- (i) individuals with disabilities who are Federal employees to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals  </s>
<s> with disabilities; and (ii) individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by such members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Universal accessibility is not just for PWDs - it is for everyone.  </s>
<s> Universal  </s>
<s> accessibility is needed to ensure that PWDs and others can access web-based information.  </s>
<s> Even though ADA and Section 508 require Federal, State and local governments to make accommodations for PWDs, there are no Federal guidelines for Agencies to use.  </s>
<s> However, some states colleges, cities, and Federal Agencies have implemented accessibility guidelines, for example City  </s>
<s> of San Jose, California.  </s>
<s> To build a Universally Accessible web site, here is an outline of the processes the web coder, content manager, graphic artist or team can use.  </s>
<s> The foundation for any universally accessible web site is the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has drafted guidelines, The Web Content Guidelines, for people to use.  </s>
<s> On this  </s>
<s> web site you will also find Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and List of Checkpoints for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The Web Accessibility Initiative also provides a forum for discussion of issues relating to Web accessibility, particularly issues related to WAI activities.  </s>
<s> Universal accessibility incorporates usability and universal design, so when  </s>
<s> building a web page or web application, accessibility problems or other design errors can be greatly reduced before release to the public.  </s>
<s> This is accomplished by applying quality assurance to check the concept, syntax and code; layout, navigation, and graphics; and acceptance testing on multiple browsers and users.  </s>
<s> Quality assurance incorporates internal or external reviews or peer reviews,  </s>
<s> and applying third party tools, for example, CAST's Bobby for an accessibility check, W3C's HTML to validate the code and StarBase's StarSweeper to check for ALT Tags, Title's, Height and Width and other quality assurance functions.  </s>
<s> Acceptance testing can be accomplished on multiple browsers to ensure the information is conveyed and there are no navigation or site usage problems.  </s>
<s> For example, here is a simple process to follow in order to build a universally accessible web page or web applications: Step 1Define the audience, business requirements, objectives, and timeline with the user.  </s>
<s> Step 2Determine resources, schedule, and sketch the process with a flowchart.  </s>
<s> Step 3Determine the design requirements and universal approach, refer to the Web Content Guidelines and internal design documents.  </s>
<s> Step 4Design and layout the web site or web application.  </s>
<s> Step 5Design Review with the customer to ensure the design is what they envisioned.  </s>
<s> Step 5QUALITY ASSURANCE.  </s>
<s> The web coder or programmer would then conduct a Quality Assurance review by using one or a combination of the following tools: Bobby; HTML code validator; content review; preview on Lynx, a text based browser; multiple browsers and versions (Internet Explorer 3 and 4, Netscape Navigator 3, 4.x, and Opera); voice-based web browser (pwWebSpeak),  </s>
<s> and screen readers (WIN Vision and Jaws For Windows), and StarBase's StarSweeper.  </s>
<s> Other items to check: does the page print properly and can the print read.  </s>
<s> Step 6UNIT TEST.  </s>
<s> This is conducted by the coder or programmer to test compliance to the business requirements established earlier.  </s>
<s> For example, test to ensure the e-mail functions and the message is received by the recipient, forms are tested and data checked, links are tested, Users who are not associated with the design can also help testing and can provide an independent third party review of the design concept.  </s>
<s> If the design uses queries or updates to modify or retrieve information form the database, then  </s>
<s> this will need to be tested.  </s>
<s> The coder can develop scenarios using a spreadsheet to document the process, more commonly referred to as a script.  </s>
<s> This serves as a baseline for the design criteria and also can document the expected results.  </s>
<s> Step 7Acceptance Test.  </s>
<s> This is formal acceptance by the customer of the product you designed as based upon customer requirements.  </s>
<s> There are alsp several efforts are underway by university-related, non-profits, consortiums and government agencies to (1) Research new technologies and apply to the home or workplace, (2) Provide education and outreach.  </s>
<s> These efforts conduct critical research and provide methodologies, guidelines or tools to support universal accessibility.  </s>
<s> Therefore, everyone must be cognizant of PWD accessibility needs for the web  </s>
<s> to ensure we can provide information to everyone.  </s>
