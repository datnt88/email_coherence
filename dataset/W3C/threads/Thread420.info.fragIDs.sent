Hello, I'm interested in Jtidy for a professionnal use and i see that the last version of Jtidy is 20/12/2000. 
I d like to know if the Jtidy project is definitively stopped or still alive? 
Thanx to answer.

It is still active. 
As I understand it they are waiting for the next release of HTML Tidy first, the last being 04/08/00. 
The guys over at SourceForge, working on HTML Tidy, are VERY active and will have a release out soon - there has been talk of an anniversary edition. 
I imagine a JTidy will quickly follow. 
See tidy.sourceforge.net 
for more details.

With XHTML 1.1 differing only very slightly in the DTD from 1.0, but with the elements now modularised, I wonder at what stage it becomes worth while to produce a version of Tidy that can begin to support this proposal? 
Can whoever is well versed in the ways of the W3C explain when a proposal is firm enough to encode against it? 
Will Tidy also respond to the modularisation by being itself modular?
