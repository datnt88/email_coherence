<s> Hello, I'm interested in Jtidy for a professionnal use and i see that the last version of Jtidy is 20/12/2000.  </s>
<s> I d like to know if the Jtidy project is definitively stopped or still alive?  </s>
<s> Thanx to answer.  </s>

<s> It is still active.  </s>
<s> As I understand it they are waiting for the next release of HTML Tidy first, the last being 04/08/00.  </s>
<s> The guys over at SourceForge, working on HTML Tidy, are VERY active and will have a release out soon - there has been talk of an anniversary edition.  </s>
<s> I imagine a JTidy will quickly follow.  </s>
<s> See tidy.sourceforge.net  </s>
<s> for more details.  </s>
<s> Regards, Doug  </s>
<s> With XHTML 1.1 differing only very slightly in the DTD from 1.0, but with the elements now modularised, I wonder at what stage it becomes worth while to produce a version of Tidy that can begin to support this proposal?  </s>
<s> Can whoever is well versed in the ways of the W3C explain when a proposal is firm enough to encode against it?  </s>
<s> Will Tidy also respond to the modularisation by being itself modular?  </s>
