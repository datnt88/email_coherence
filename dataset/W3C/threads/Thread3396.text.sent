hi again, We promised[1] to learn more about the people we arereaching wth our dissemination efforts, and one way to find out more is to ask website visitors about themselves. 
At the last face to face we decided it would be useful to have a short questionnaire for visitors, linked to information about the newsletter. 
We need to decide what those questions should be. 
Here are my suggestions, based on [1]. 
(1) Which group are you from? 
Our dissemination plan is based around reaching four different (often overlapping) groups: * Internet, Web and Open Source developer communities * Academic and Research Community * Content and Tool Producers * Industry and Commerce and perhaps * other so being able to pick from those (check-box-style) would be one important question. 
(2) Where are you geographically based? 
To evaluate whether the project is too uk-centric, it would be useful to know where visitors to the site were based. 
Perhaps a drop-down menu would be appropriate here. 
(3) How did you hear of us? 
This might be useful for working out which are our best dissemintation efforts. 
Any thoughts? 
Libby [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dissemination_plan_2/ Being able to pick multiples is important I think, and having a box for free comment is always a good thing - whether they are otehr or not. 
Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia/Pacific? 
please specify country? 
The difficulty is that because most of the site is in english (I have a couple of things in spanish, french and italian there) it makes sense that people who speak other languages look in other places, even for stuff that comes from the project. 
We should ensure that we have a privacy policy for all this, and that it matches what we say on the site. 
cheers Chaals A little one: questions along the lines of "Are you currently using semweb tech?" "Are you planning to in the near future?" 
might help see whether emphasis should be on initial exposure or a step (or two) further along. 
yep, good idea... (we'll end up with rdf, right?) chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France
