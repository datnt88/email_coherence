<s> Hi Gary, I'm having trouble seizing the purpose of your mail, do you have any simple to understand questions ?  </s>
<s> :-)) More seriously, I don't believe you'll get a satisfactory answer, if you aren't more explicit about what your problems are.  </s>
<s> What is your OS, *which* tidy are you talking about (there are quite a number, as e.g. JavaTidy, TidyGUI...) What expectations do you have using tidy...  </s>
<s> Or do you find the manual too difficult to read ?  </s>
<s> Tidy's not a web browser, nor a word processor, you know... :-)) CU Norbert __o This was The Megabyte Text Magician - http://tmtm.free.fr  </s>

<s> Hi, I am using JTidy with an XML source file (I use setXmlTags(true)) and I have the following messages : line 2 column 1 - Error: is not recognized!  </s>

<s> This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.  </s>
<s> ... with the following file : chapitre1 chapitre2 chapitre3 chapitre4 Is there anything else to do in order to parse XML file without errors ?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Denis Queffeulou  </s>
<s> I have found the problem : The class TagTable is a singleton but not the class Configuration and TagTable has a reference on an instance of Configuration.  </s>
<s> This reference changes at each instanciation of a Tidy, so the TagTable references the LAST instance of Configuration created.  </s>
<s> This causes a problem in method TagTable.findTag because the instance of Configuration is not the same as the one used by Tidy, so the XmlTags flag has not the value expected.  </s>
<s> I have transformed Configuration into a singleton to resolve the problem.  </s>
<s> I think it's a bug.  </s>
