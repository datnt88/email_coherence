<s> if so which one, and does it print well?  </s>
<s> Are you asking at a specification level or an implementation level?  </s>
<s> At the spec level the answer is 'of course' since nothing prevents this.  </s>
<s> The svg has already been moved from server to client; it can clearly be saved locally and further manipulated.  </s>
<s> At the implementation level the answer is 'ask the svg implementor, the web browser implementor, and the word processor implementor'.  </s>
<s> The crucial part is the browser since that implements the 'drag selected image to desktop' functionality which is not defined in any spec.. alternative ways such as 'save svg' 'save as...' are also implemented, for example.  </s>
<s> And then you would need a wordprocessor that either implements SVG or allows plugins/activex/publish and subscribe/bonobo/some other component architecture to allow wordprocessor files to contain foreign formats that are handled by some other code.  </s>
<s> JC If the whole page is a single SVG, is it possible to do the same to an JC individual image that forms part of the page?  </s>
<s> That would require more functionality, but is still something that could be implemented.  </s>

<s> Chris, thanks for replying, Is it possible to take all  </s>
<s> well yes: teaching staff visit peepo.com  </s>
<s> copy images from the site and paste them into a word document which they then print.  </s>
<s> Students who cannot read then follow the list of graphics to navigate to the relevant website 'independently'.  </s>
<s> We are studying whether and how well this leads to student directed independent browsing at peepo.com.  </s>
<s> More able students with minimal reading skills, and even some able readers use peepo.com  </s>
<s> independently already.  </s>
<s> examples created by staff using this process are here: http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/worksheets/.  </s>
<s> this ability to repurpose the partial content using copy and paste should be part of the original SVG standard.  </s>
<s> It is slightly complex, would g /g and svg /svg be natural divisions?  </s>
<s> at least to start with.  </s>
<s> One would then need the option to copy page, or copy image(group) Could amaya implement this?  </s>
<s> I've sent an enhancement request to the Amaya list.  </s>
<s> perhaps you could comment there?  </s>
