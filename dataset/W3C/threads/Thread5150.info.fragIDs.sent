Is it possible to copy and paste an SVG image* from a web page into a word processing application? 
if so which one, and does it print well? 
If the whole page is a single SVG, is it possible to do the same to an individual image that forms part of the page? 
thanks Jonathan *Teachers use images from our site to create their own worksheets. 
Some are here: in .doc 
form my apologies.

Are you asking at a specification level or an implementation level? 
At the spec level the answer is 'of course' since nothing prevents this. 
The svg has already been moved from server to client; it can clearly be saved locally and further manipulated. 
At the implementation level the answer is 'ask the svg implementor, the web browser implementor, and the word processor implementor'. 
The crucial part is the browser since that implements the 'drag selected image to desktop' functionality which is not defined in any spec.. alternative ways such as 'save svg' 'save as...' are also implemented, for example. 
And then you would need a wordprocessor that either implements SVG or allows plugins/activex/publish and subscribe/bonobo/some other component architecture to allow wordprocessor files to contain foreign formats that are handled by some other code.

That would require more functionality, but is still something that could be implemented.

Ah. Talking of printing and accessibility... 
Is it possible to take all 
(pr part) of a .doc 
image and paste it into a word processing application other than the one that created it?

Chris, thanks for replying, Is it possible to take all 
well yes: teaching staff visit peepo.com 
copy images from the site and paste them into a word document which they then print. 
Students who cannot read then follow the list of graphics to navigate to the relevant website 'independently'. 
We are studying whether and how well this leads to student directed independent browsing at peepo.com. 
More able students with minimal reading skills, and even some able readers use peepo.com 
independently already. 
examples created by staff using this process are here: http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/worksheets/. 
this ability to repurpose the partial content using copy and paste should be part of the original SVG standard. 
It is slightly complex, would g /g and svg /svg be natural divisions? 
at least to start with. 
One would then need the option to copy page, or copy image(group) Could amaya implement this? 
I've sent an enhancement request to the Amaya list. 
perhaps you could comment there? 
thanks Jonathan
