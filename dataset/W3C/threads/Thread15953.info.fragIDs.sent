<s> Hi there, Whoever said that you cannot use print graphics on the net is wrong.  </s>
<s> We do it all the time at Netvertising.com and Easy Access.com.  </s>
<s> There are two important differences: 1.Print uses a much higher DPI [usually 300 or more].  </s>
<s> The net is currently 72 DPI.  </s>
<s> 2.There is a more limited color palette for the net.  </s>
<s> However, it is very easy to take print graphics and compress them or ever so slightly change them to make them work on line.  </s>
<s> Here we routinely do this: create brochures etc. for print and then recycle the art for the net.  </s>
<s> If one wishes to do the reverse, i.e. use graphics from a web site and covert them to print - that is very difficult because the the graphic essentially has to be redone.  </s>
<s> Regards, Joanne Dolgow  </s>
<s> The point that Dr Nielsen was making is that Print Design and Web Design are different.  </s>
<s> Print design works, but very badly, on the Web.  </s>
<s> Web Design often works, but very badly, in print.  </s>
<s> (By Web design I mean design which is well-founded in the medium, not print-design techniques applied to a website) Although individual graphics can most certainly be reused on the net (and should from an advertising perpspective - it helps product recognition immensely for many people) there are features of the Web which do not apply to print, such as the prevalence of Web Users who do not download the graphics - not an option when reading a printed document.  </s>
<s> On the other hand the web allows the construction of complex documents with various interrelated parts being connected in a manner that is not directly reproducible in print, which is generally limited to two-dimensionality and is constrained in terms of its size, and the ability to seamlessly integrate audio (again only good for some users) into a document.  </s>

<s> Also, web graphics (2D, non-animated) must be saved in .jpg or .gif format for most browsers to read them (there may be an exception, but I do not know it).  </s>
<s> The compression techniques utilized by these formats (especially .gif)  </s>

<s> Print designers may use .eps,  </s>

<s> The graphics may be the same, but the formats are very different.  </s>

<s> Photo Shop, Quark, etc. are easily able to do this.  </s>
<s> Also, going from print to net is easy - it is the other way around that is more difficult; i.e. net to print.  </s>
