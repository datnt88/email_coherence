<s> Hi... I just found your wine data via an XML hack article.  </s>
<s> Nifty stuff!  </s>
<s> But the actual data... doesn't quite conform to the DAML/RDF specs... it's not too far off: * use rdf:ID, not rdfs:ID * use rdf:RDF as the root element, not Ontology don't put all the other objects insidet he Ontology object.  </s>
<s> * use rdf:about="" on the Ontology element, to say that this file ("") is an ontology.  </s>
<s> Without it, you're just saying "there is an ontology".  </s>
<s> That's it!  </s>

<s> Hi Dan, Thank you, again, for your comments.  </s>

<s> Yes, the changes you make look very good, since the range (nation) and the property are no longer confused.  </s>
<s> Another change that could be made, but might continue to be confusing, is to make the property a lower-case 'nation' since RDF is case-sensitive.  </s>
<s> However, the way you described in your email seems to me to be correct and unambigous.  </s>
