At the teleconf call it was pointed out that it looked unbalanced to ask that background images be removable but not background sounds (at the upper levels) 
I don't understand the principle here. 
My assumption is that people are worried that background images will interfere with the readability of text. 
But has the GL group bothered to investigate the issue, or have they simply decided that their own vague mental image is sufficient to ban an entire practice? 
The range of practice includes: "CLASSIC" UNREADABLE FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND COMBOS I suppose the example of http://www.michaelkelly.fsnet.co.uk/ -- the sort of thing that is now very very hard to find-- is what the guideline was originally intended to address. 
Admittedly hard to read the text here. 
GRAPHIC-DESIGN BACKGROUNDS I assure the Web Accessibility Initiative that Web designers are perfectly able to specify a background image that works well with foreground text. 
Example: http://www.wpdfd.com/ . 
BACKGROUNDS with CUTOUTS As seen in http://www.chromewaves.org/chromeblog.php3 , a CSS div or even a table cell cuts a legible slice out of the background image. 
Eric Meyer knows everything there is to know about CSS and uses backgrounds himself: http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/demo2.html . 
I would hardly place him in the category of "person impairing accessibility for others." 
DECORATIVE USES A subset of the others, really-- headlines and such. 
http://rebelprince.com/ has a small background image behind selectable text. 
Really, what is the harm? 
(I saw an even better example last week and bookmarked it, but where is it now?) 
Anyway, why must the page author go to all the trouble to code a capacity to remove background images when this is properly the role of the user agent and the user stylesheet? 
I would appreciate it if WAI leaders could provide convincing reassurance that: * This is a known accessibility issue that has affected real people and is not a theoretical worry. 
* Forcing authors to code custom workarounds is the least-invasive method of solving the problem. 
* This is in no way a reflexive action designed to outlaw a feature that makes Web sites look nice. 
(WAI has a habit of bandying about the prohibition of practices that contribute to good graphic design.) 
I am looking for proof that the guideline does not exist to sabotage good visual design-- and that even if such was not the motive, it will not end up as the result. 
It was pointed out the guidelines was "text presented over graphics" . 
So you can't put words on top of pictures now? 
There goes any accessible retrospective of Gran Fury's work for ACT UP in the 1980s. 
Donald Moffett and his cohorts layered text over images all the time. 
And doesn't this mean Dean Allen can't run a photo of a puppy named Hugo with the word HUGO superimposed? 
Please explain how this does not constitute an assault on graphic design, and how alt, title, and longdesc cannot make the general case ("text presented over graphics") accessible. 
Our decision was therefore to not put requirements in the higher levels for speech to be separable from background sound - nor to require that there be specific separation between speech and background. 
There are captions that can be used for those who can see and cannot hear well. 
Good. 
1.5 Benefit #2 Speech over background sounds Because speech is often naturally mixed with background sounds and cannot be easily removed or separated, captions are provided (under checkpoint guideline 1.2) to make dialog understandable. 
However not all people can see or read the captions. 
Where speech is mixed or recorded so that it is at least 20 db above any background sounds people do not need to rely on captions to understand the dialog. 
What does this mean, if anything? 
Suddenly you can sweet-talk your audio engineer to arrange a 20-dB differential between speech and background and the file no longer has to be captioned? 
The guideline, as written, implies that a 20-dB sound difference eliminates deafness. 
It eliminates the need for captioning. 
I question the *entire basis* of this discussion-- with text and with graphics-- and urge WAI to retract both. 
It's another example of nonexperts trying to overthrow the Web as we know it.

To Whom It May Concern - 
I read with interest the note from Mr. Joe Clark. 
It is clear to this individual that just looking at a page and making assumptions is not enough to assume that there is adequate accessibility. 
Mr. Clark points to: 
and stiill remains accessible - not the caser for me. 
Mr Clark sites: GRAPHIC-DESIGN BACKGROUNDS I assure the Web Accessibility Initiative that Web designers are perfectly able to specify a background image that works well with foreground text. 
Example: http://www.wpdfd.com/ . 
It just goes to show that those without significant color blindness/contrast issues are NOT in a position to say what is the best for those of us who have this issue. 
The red text on the blue background presented a real 
problem for me - this was NOT an easy read!

Actually-- and thanks ever so much for asking-- this individual did two weeks of research on colourblindness, including talking to leading researchers in the field and amassing half an inch of clippings, in order to write the "Type &amp; Colour" chapter in his book on Web accessibility, which was then vetted by those experts. 
(Check the acknowledgements.) Inasmuch as no person in the history of human civilization has been able to determine what another person sees, I am as well-informed on colour deficiencies as any layperson could reasonably be. 
You can't tell me what I see and I can't tell you what you see. 
It's real simple. 
Do you refer to the word "Comment," the small "taming the electronic page," or the (orange) phrases "search" and "a case history"? 
Oh, but wait. 
How 'bout the white text on the background? 
Not bad, right? 
So maybe it's a contrast issue. 
Maybe that contrast issue could be resolved easily through user stylesheets or user-agent reprogramming, and does not require a WAI edict that page authors code a way to destry or remove their own page backgrounds.

Let's look at it from a common sense point of view. 
If I have a black 
background image and use white text against that black background image, I just created a problem with accessibility that could be eliminated with a little common sense. 
If my background image includes a majority 
of color which I must contrast my text in such a manner as it would contrast well with the selected background color. 
Background images are of no real value. 
Excessive graphics are arduous and hold no true value except to make things look well for those visual individuals. 
However, they can be extremely confusing for the 
cognitively disabled. 
Graphical text headers and graphical buttons serve no real purpose or value except to the individual developing the page or the site. 
Background sounds are typically sound bytes of non-vocal types. 
Therefore, they don't really offer any value to the hearing impaired. 
To think that an audio sound byte of a vocal nature is used on a page as background audio leaves me thinking that we haven't really examined the issue of background sounds. 
Background sounds with vocals are typically found in Flash, Shockwave, QuickTime, and any other multimedia presentation - not a web page. 
By 
programming the presentation correctly with captions or written 
explanations clears that problem up. 
Having the 20db difference between background noise and the vocal part of the presentation should be required and does present value of getting the sound engineer to generate a larger difference between the vocals and background noise as Mr. Clark points out. 
Perhaps, we should change the issue from simply background images to the background then it wouldn't make a difference if the browser does not download useless and meaningless images just to be challenged by the designer with no common sense. 
When using a background image the 
background should be of a consistent value thereby allowing the developer to maintain the difference in contrast, saturation, and hue 
from the written text in the document. 
I think this clearly clears up the problem and adds a level of accessibility not previously encountered. 
Lee 
I see that WAI is managing to top itself. 
And when was the message going to start doing that? 
White text on a black background sounds like a nice legible combination to me. 
Isn't that what we use in, say, print? 
For "those people," in other words. 
In this simple paragraph, we at last see a confirmation that Web Accessibility Initiative contributors hold good visual design in outright contempt. 
Background images are, after all, "of no real value," it has been decreed. 
...and of course to the many readers who appreciate good visual design, including people with disabilities, such as deaf or mobility-impaired persons. 
Of course, those groups simply *are less important* than people with cognitive impairments, for whom the entire Web must be overthrown on the unproven contention that it will make the Web less inaccessible for them. 
Oh? 
If we took this reasoning to its ultimate, non-vocal music programs would not be captioned, nor would any soundtrack orchestration. 
Are you ready to defend this denial of accessibility? 
You don't see any HTML on that page? 
Aren't they delivered by HTTP in cases other than dedicated streams? 
How do these multimedia presentations fail to be Web pages? 
I also appreciate this confirmation that Web Accessibility Initiative contributors are now willing to micromanage, on pain of refusal of WAI accessibility certificate, the editing of every audio track on the Web. 
Ah, yes. 
Useless and meaningless images. 
Really, they all are, aren't they? 
It does clarify the delusionalism and extremism of certain Web Accessibility Initiative proposed practices, yes. 
It even clearly 
clarifies them. 
What it *adds a level of* not previously encountered 
is, I think, something else.

I'm confused why, just because you disagree with what one of the people on the working group says, you have to make this all about how screwed up the entire Web Accessibility Initiative is, instead of just realizing that you, a member of the WAI working group, disagree with the statement of another member of the WAI working group. 
It really seems counter-productive if you're waiting for any person to speak up and say something you disagree with, just so that you can leap up with righteous rage and condemn the entire process. 
Surely it would be better to try to convince, rather than condemn, and thus strive to promote that W3C elusive goal, "consensus"?

I guess one thing stays unspoken: Usability and several accessibility aspects (sometimes) are subjective. 
And I noticed that usability/accessibility topics were mixed up with content related themes. 
For some users white-on-black text might be legible, for others it is not. 
For some users (and even the designers), some images (background or not) make sense, others won't agree. 
There are far more examples, related to as well accessibility as content... 'Common sense' is necessary, that's right... Regards, Jens Meiert.
