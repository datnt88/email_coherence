<s> Actually-- and thanks ever so much for asking-- this individual did two weeks of research on colourblindness, including talking to leading researchers in the field and amassing half an inch of clippings, in order to write the "Type &amp; Colour" chapter in his book on Web accessibility, which was then vetted by those experts.  </s>
<s> (Check the acknowledgements.) Inasmuch as no person in the history of human civilization has been able to determine what another person sees, I am as well-informed on colour deficiencies as any layperson could reasonably be.  </s>
<s> You can't tell me what I see and I can't tell you what you see.  </s>
<s> It's real simple.  </s>
<s> Do you refer to the word "Comment," the small "taming the electronic page," or the (orange) phrases "search" and "a case history"?  </s>
<s> Oh, but wait.  </s>
<s> How 'bout the white text on the background?  </s>
<s> Not bad, right?  </s>
<s> So maybe it's a contrast issue.  </s>
<s> Maybe that contrast issue could be resolved easily through user stylesheets or user-agent reprogramming, and does not require a WAI edict that page authors code a way to destry or remove their own page backgrounds.  </s>

<s> Accessibility http://joeclark.org/access/  </s>
<s> Weblogs and articles http://joeclark.org/weblogs/  </s>
<s> Let's look at it from a common sense point of view.  </s>
<s> If I have a black  </s>
<s> background image and use white text against that black background image, I just created a problem with accessibility that could be eliminated with a little common sense.  </s>
<s> If my background image includes a majority  </s>
<s> of color which I must contrast my text in such a manner as it would contrast well with the selected background color.  </s>
<s> Background images are of no real value.  </s>
<s> Excessive graphics are arduous and hold no true value except to make things look well for those visual individuals.  </s>
<s> However, they can be extremely confusing for the  </s>
<s> cognitively disabled.  </s>
<s> Graphical text headers and graphical buttons serve no real purpose or value except to the individual developing the page or the site.  </s>
<s> Background sounds are typically sound bytes of non-vocal types.  </s>
<s> Therefore, they don't really offer any value to the hearing impaired.  </s>
<s> To think that an audio sound byte of a vocal nature is used on a page as background audio leaves me thinking that we haven't really examined the issue of background sounds.  </s>
<s> Background sounds with vocals are typically found in Flash, Shockwave, QuickTime, and any other multimedia presentation - not a web page.  </s>
<s> By  </s>
<s> programming the presentation correctly with captions or written  </s>
<s> explanations clears that problem up.  </s>
<s> Having the 20db difference between background noise and the vocal part of the presentation should be required and does present value of getting the sound engineer to generate a larger difference between the vocals and background noise as Mr. Clark points out.  </s>
<s> Perhaps, we should change the issue from simply background images to the background then it wouldn't make a difference if the browser does not download useless and meaningless images just to be challenged by the designer with no common sense.  </s>
<s> When using a background image the  </s>
<s> background should be of a consistent value thereby allowing the developer to maintain the difference in contrast, saturation, and hue  </s>
<s> from the written text in the document.  </s>
<s> I think this clearly clears up the problem and adds a level of accessibility not previously encountered.  </s>
<s> Lee  </s>
<s> I see that WAI is managing to top itself.  </s>
<s> And when was the message going to start doing that?  </s>
<s> White text on a black background sounds like a nice legible combination to me.  </s>
<s> Isn't that what we use in, say, print?  </s>
<s> For "those people," in other words.  </s>
<s> In this simple paragraph, we at last see a confirmation that Web Accessibility Initiative contributors hold good visual design in outright contempt.  </s>
<s> Background images are, after all, "of no real value," it has been decreed.  </s>
<s> ...and of course to the many readers who appreciate good visual design, including people with disabilities, such as deaf or mobility-impaired persons.  </s>
<s> Of course, those groups simply *are less important* than people with cognitive impairments, for whom the entire Web must be overthrown on the unproven contention that it will make the Web less inaccessible for them.  </s>
<s> Oh?  </s>
<s> If we took this reasoning to its ultimate, non-vocal music programs would not be captioned, nor would any soundtrack orchestration.  </s>
<s> Are you ready to defend this denial of accessibility?  </s>
<s> You don't see any HTML on that page?  </s>
<s> Aren't they delivered by HTTP in cases other than dedicated streams?  </s>
<s> How do these multimedia presentations fail to be Web pages?  </s>
<s> I also appreciate this confirmation that Web Accessibility Initiative contributors are now willing to micromanage, on pain of refusal of WAI accessibility certificate, the editing of every audio track on the Web.  </s>
<s> Ah, yes.  </s>
<s> Useless and meaningless images.  </s>
<s> Really, they all are, aren't they?  </s>
<s> It does clarify the delusionalism and extremism of certain Web Accessibility Initiative proposed practices, yes.  </s>
<s> It even clearly  </s>
<s> clarifies them.  </s>
<s> What it *adds a level of* not previously encountered  </s>
<s> is, I think, something else.  </s>

<s> I'm confused why, just because you disagree with what one of the people on the working group says, you have to make this all about how screwed up the entire Web Accessibility Initiative is, instead of just realizing that you, a member of the WAI working group, disagree with the statement of another member of the WAI working group.  </s>
<s> It really seems counter-productive if you're waiting for any person to speak up and say something you disagree with, just so that you can leap up with righteous rage and condemn the entire process.  </s>
<s> Surely it would be better to try to convince, rather than condemn, and thus strive to promote that W3C elusive goal, "consensus"?  </s>
