<s> Thanks for alerting me to this, David.  </s>
<s> We're playing with it but haven't yet figured out how to code the audio descriptions to be turned on and off.  </s>
<s> They don't seem to be using either a SMIL 1.0-like attribute (similar to the system-captions attribute) or the SMIL-Boston attribute systemAudioDesc.  </s>
<s> Also, we noticed that they made captions and audio descriptions mutually exclusive by using radio buttons to choose between them.  </s>
<s> Anyone besides us think it would be useful to have independent control over the two features?  </s>

<s> Not just yes, but !@#$ yes, as Love would say grin .  </s>
<s> We need your consensus to prod PF into taking the position that _all_ of these things belong as 'bag' semantics where a multiple selection is possible in the base-level definition, and the "pick only one" behavior is not the base definition but an overlaid default, which can be rolled back by the right kind of user intervention.  </s>
<s> For a concrete scenario (just one stab): The person wishing both captions and audio descriptions has some hearing loss but not total; and also enough vision impairment to use a screen magnifier.  </s>
<s> The captions are necessary because in this cinema_verite the dialog is in barely decipherable grunts, while the audio descriptions are articulated with a bell-like tone that needs no text alternative.  </s>
<s> So the user processes the dialog in audio+caption+magnifier and catches up with what the magnifier leaves out by the audio descriptions in audio.  </s>
<s> [The generic answer is that "both" ususally involves a scenario with a user with functional impairment, but not total functional loss, in two modes.]  </s>
