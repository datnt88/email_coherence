<s> Since TITLE is part of anchors, couldn't TITLE just be the TITLE in the HEADER block of the document that the anchor references?  </s>
<s> This seems very straight forward and the user would not need to think abut it to much if the TITLE has aready been defined in the other document.  </s>
<s> Authoring tools could also easily use the TITLE information of the referenced document to fill in the TITLE statement automatically without the author even needing to know about it.  </s>
<s> ALT text would be a description of the image.  </s>

<s> That would mean that when the first page is loaded (the one that contains the link to the second page) a fetch would have to be made to all the pages referenced to pull the TITLE out.  </s>

<s> Response made with JRG:  </s>
<s> JRG: This could be an option in the browser, but an author or authoring tool could use just look at the title in the header of a URL (either electronically or with a browser) and insert the title text in the TITLE attribute of the ANCHOR element.  </s>
<s> People were discussing simple usage strategies for TITLE, ALT and LONGDESC.  </s>
<s> This seemed to be one option that I thought would be good for the TITLE attribute.  </s>

<s> I think Jon was thinking more in terms of authoring tools that of browsers, although both options are possible.  </s>
<s> The issue with authoring tools is that pages the might be authored off-line and the "automaric title extraction" is not possible, otherwise, it could be nice addition as it can help validating the link going out of a page at authoring time.  </s>
<s> It is an easy rule for people to remember when people are hand coding the TITLE attribute of an ANCHOR.  </s>
<s> There is no ambiguty on what to put in the TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> Just put the TITLE in the HEADER block of the referenced document.  </s>
<s> This would be easy to explain in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> ALT text could be a short description of the image (icon, logo, picture) or the purpose of the image (chart, graph, map).  </s>
<s> LONGDESC would be an interpretation of the image.  </s>
