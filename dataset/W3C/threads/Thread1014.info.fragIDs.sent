Hi There, I got tidy running as part of Typo3 (danish CMS) and after configuring it like this: tidy -i --quiet true -f tidy_errors.txt 
--tidy-mark true -wrap 0 --show-warnings false --quote-ampersand false errors show up in the error_log like: Can't open "/root/.tidyrc" 
Now I read on the list this can be a system wide config. 
I made a file in that location and put in the line: show-warnings: false, but my error_log still tells me it can't open .tidyrc. 
Is this the right location for a configfile and why can't .tidyrc 
open?

Hi Ben, 
You are right. 
Tidy is wrong. 
This is an old bug, where it doesn't check for the existence of the file. 
You can disable the ~/.tidyrc "feature" by un-defining SUPPORT_GETPWNAM in the build. 
You don't have to modify the source, but you do need to update the Makefile. 
Update line 62 to read as follows: 
CFLAGS= -I $(INCLDIR) -USUPPORT_GETPWNAM The -U option to gcc undefines a preprocessor macro. 
Then just run "make" with no arguments. 
take it easy, Charlie 
Specifically : http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=473072&amp;group_id=27659&amp;atid=3909 63 I guess I differ in opinion that Tidy is wrong grin . 
But then again I don't use this feature on my platform. 
You didn't say exactly what your platform was (I assume it is some form of UN*X), and whether you built Tidy yourself, or downloaded one of the pre-built versions. 
Is HOME set to "/root"? 
In which case is that the home directory for "root" on your system, and are you logged in as "root"? 
If not logged in as "root", and HOME is not set to your home directory, then maybe the open failed due to a permissions problem. 
Or is environment variable HTML_TIDY set? 
Perhaps you need to put a dummy ".tidyrc" in other places as well as "/root". 
Hope this helps.
