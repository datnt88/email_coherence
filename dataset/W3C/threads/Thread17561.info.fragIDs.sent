At the meeting in LA last week a new accessibility problem was announced called browser sniffing. 
Browser sniffing is done by a Web server to determine what browser requested information and denying information if you are not an approved browser. 
This is a problem since many browsers used by persons with disabilities are not "approved" by these servers. 
The practice seems to orginate by organizations (like banks) concerned about security and limiting the site to browsers that support secure transations. 
The current method of sniffing does not really detect if a browser supports secure transactions, it mainly just wants to know if you are netscape navigator or microsoft explorer. 
So even if your browser can handle secure transactions, the serve will ignore the request. 
Main questions for the user agent group is: Is this an issue the user agent working group wants to deal with? 
If so what do we want to do? 
How many people in the current working group are familiar with this problem and the technical issues surrounding it?

I have a question/quiry and a thought. 
is this not a server issue? the server through a "script" that examines where a user is coming from gets the user agent information and decides what to do with it. 
this is most likely similar to deciding to put up those nasty messages like "you're browser is not frames capable, download this or that browser and try again". 
or you are not using xxx shame on you. is there a group in the wai that handles server issues? 
here's the thought. 
in our ua guidelines, we can have a list of browsers that support security and hope/ask servers to allow them.

In response to David Poehlman, Broswer sniffing is a server issue, and I think WAI will bring it up with the server people at W3C. 
I think in general W3C is against browser sniffing, but it not clear what power they have to stop it. 
Do you think it is something UA should be dealing with and make a statement?

Jon, I think a request that if it is used it should be used judiciously is in order. 
if a browser is truly insecure than I under stand partially the point. 
if it is being uused to deny fredom of information than that is something else again and should be garded against. 
I guess we could tell user agents how to break it. 
it can be a simple trick to fool a site that looks at the user agent into passing your browser by falsifying the user agent. 
not all browsers can do this, but some can.

I was attempting to remember the part this played in a discussion we had some time back. 
browser snipping was a part of a new set of capabilities.

As a browser developer we must say that browser sniffing is a problem. 
The result is that we need to say that we are Netscape to get pages that are ok or even get pages at all in some cases. 
What would have been much better is to be able to ask for pages using a system where you say whether the browser and user want certain things such as - frames - tables - java - javascript - images This allows the page designer to take these things into consideration and deliver an optimal page. 
Sadly, some of them will just say "turn on feature X".

JRG in response to Jon S. von Tetzchner: What do you think WAI or W3C should do about this? 
Should WAI make a statement against any use of sniffing? 
Should sniffing be done on technical merits of a browsers features and not it's developers name?

I really think W3C should get involved. 
I think that getting rid of browser sniffing will be very difficult, but I agree that it should be based on what the browser/user can handle and not on the type of browser. 
This would allow designers to make pages that fit the user, no matter which browser s/he is using.
