To: Our organization has been looking at acquiring a web-services management platform but need clarification on several thoughts. 
Should the management platform provide orchestration capability so that the endpoint breaks apart a request and sends it to downstream services or should be management platform simply route it to an orchestration service that then calls the management platform to find other services. 
If you have thoughts on this, please do not hesitate to reply back. 
Since I am the author of a web services book: Java Web Services Architecture send a complimentary copy to whomever provides the best answer. 
Thanks in advance.

Would you please explain what do you mean by "request" and how do you express it?

Sorry, I had on my business hat for a second. 
Request was refering to a client posting a SOAP message to a services management platform endpoint. 
The incoming SOAP message needs to be broken into 1..n parts and routed separately to different services. 
Likewise each service will return a message that needs to be merged back into a single outgoing SOAP message. the service Would you please explain what do you mean by "request" and how do you express it?

Up to my knowledge, a SOAP message is sent directly to its destination, i.e., to a single service. 
The format of the message contents is precisely specified in the WSDL interface of this service.

Management platforms provide a level of indirection which is useful for adding into an architecture the concept of metering, monitoring, billing, routing, security, and so on.

I do not consider it as an answer to my question: What do you mean by "request"? 
However, generally you are right that a complex client's request (task) may be broken into a number of sub-requests and routed separately to different services. 
Some of these services (if they are composite) may again decompose the sub-request into sub-sub-requests and send separately to different services, and so on recursively. 
Note that these different services may come from different providers / vendors. 
Hence, there MUST be *platform independent* uniform standard way/language to express requests. 
There is an attempt in this direction, see M. Papazoglou, M. Aiello, M. Pistore, and J. Yang. 
XSRL: A Request Language for Web Services. 
Published at However, specs of XSRL are not available. 
IMO the concept of request is crucial for web services technology. 
Perhaps this very issue should be addressed by W3C and the "great" IT vendors instead of trying to recover dying or already dead technologies.
