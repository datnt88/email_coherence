One of the questions that came up when I talked to webont about datatypes was why we were using rdf:datatype and not xsi:type. 
I couldn't remember the reason at the time, but I do think we need to have one. 
Can someone remind me please. 
One that now comes to mind is that xsi:type can take qname values and we need a URI for the datatype, and the standard namespace ref for xsd: does not produce the right uri. 
Also there is the potential for confusion if we 
have one attribute that can take qname values and none of the others do.

From the parser writers point of view this would be a pain. 
The hard work is in supporting the first, and then we can't give (this useful functionality) to the users other than in a very limited scope. 
Thus qnames in RDF2 looks like a plausible mantra. 
There is also a can of worms that we are currently ducking to do with invisibly used namespaces (in XML Literals). 
I find it harder to duck if we (like xsi, xslt xpointer ...) decide that invisibly used namespaces are cool. 
(Note xsi:type="xsd:decimal" visibly uses xsi, and invisibly uses xsd).

Patrick: 
UAProf, where three of its four core datatypes 
that's getting more compelling ... (I am not expecting to change anyone's mind here - but it helps to have a devils advocate when preparing the case for rdf:datatype).
