<s> One of the questions that came up when I talked to webont about datatypes was why we were using rdf:datatype and not xsi:type.  </s>
<s> I couldn't remember the reason at the time, but I do think we need to have one.  </s>
<s> Can someone remind me please.  </s>
<s> One that now comes to mind is that xsi:type can take qname values and we need a URI for the datatype, and the standard namespace ref for xsd: does not produce the right uri.  </s>
<s> Also there is the potential for confusion if we  </s>

<s> From the parser writers point of view this would be a pain.  </s>
<s> The hard work is in supporting the first, and then we can't give (this useful functionality) to the users other than in a very limited scope.  </s>
<s> Thus qnames in RDF2 looks like a plausible mantra.  </s>
<s> There is also a can of worms that we are currently ducking to do with invisibly used namespaces (in XML Literals).  </s>
<s> I find it harder to duck if we (like xsi, xslt xpointer ...) decide that invisibly used namespaces are cool.  </s>
<s> (Note xsi:type="xsd:decimal" visibly uses xsi, and invisibly uses xsd).  </s>
