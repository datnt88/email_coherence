<s> EOWG: [thread starter] Another deliverable is a policy reference listing.  </s>
<s> Within the US, there are 4 or more laws or related policies that somehow relate to Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> I can pull together a reference listing for those, but need pointers to policies outside the US.  </s>
<s> In the US: - Section 504 of the Rehab Act (indirectly) - Section 508 of the Rehab Act (still somewhat indirect) - ADA, particular via US DOJ opinion on Web accessibility - Section 255 of Telecommunications Act (although it doesn't address Web as much as it might...)  </s>
<s> In Canada, what are the relevant laws, regs, policies?  </s>
<s> In Australia, my understanding is New South Wales has stringent guidelines, federally less so but still general guidelines?  </s>
<s> In Europe, different countries have different levels of requirements, and there is no EU-wide requirement yet?  </s>
<s> Asian countries, any requirements to date?  </s>
<s> If you have information on these, please send pointers so we can compile them.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you have a particular interest in hunting some of this down.  </s>

<s> The Amsterdam treaty contains a new Article (6a) and a Declaration (22) on people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> ==== extract: TREATY OF AMSTERDAM (Oct 97) AMENDING THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION, THE TREATIES ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND CERTAIN RELATED ACTS.  </s>
<s> The following Article shall be inserted: "Article 6a".  </s>
<s> Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.' Declaration 22 regarding persons with a disability.  </s>
<s> The Conference agrees that, in drawing up measures under Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the institutions of the Community shall take account of the needs of persons with a disability.  </s>
<s> Full text of the Amsterdam treaty in PDF is available at I also have received from the European Commission a document entitled: LEGAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IMPACTING REHABILITATION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY Horizontal European Activities in Rehabilitation Technology (HEART TIDE study 309 - Aug 93) I'll attach the Executive Summary and the list of countries reviewed.  </s>
<s> ==== extract The following report examines the national legislation existing in eleven European countries - eight European Community Member States and three European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries - and identifies the legislative measures which do, directly or indirectly, affect the rehabilitation technology market.This report was completed in August 1993 and thus does not take account of more recent legislation.  </s>
<s> The report does not set out to provide a comprehensive picture of all existing legislation, regulations, guidelines or voluntary codes of practice in each country.  </s>
<s> It does, however, focus on the principal laws and regulations within certain areas of activity, such as working life, where they exist and highlights the areas where there is no statutory provision of technical aids.  </s>
<s> Neither does the report analyse the effectiveness of the legislation in each country as this will be the subject of the second report.  </s>
<s> Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, The United Kingdom For each, it goes over Introduction Legal and administrative framework Legislation related to rehabilitation technology Future trends References I put the complete document (in doc and generated html) at: Of course, UK has its DDA Other than that, more specific to France, I recently received some information about a group of Telecom operators challenging the sharing of the Universal Service cost with France Telecom.  </s>
<s> More development to follow.  </s>
<s> In Canada, the overarching legal framework is contained in the Canadian Human Rights Act.  </s>
<s> It has (very) recently been amended to include the concept of "reasonable accommodation".  </s>
<s> To my knowledge, it has not been tested yet in a court.  </s>
<s> I will dig up the relevant sections and post them here later today.  </s>
<s> There are no government policies (either federal or provincial) corresponding the rehab act.  </s>
<s> Government does not have to take accessibility into account during procurement.  </s>
<s> We have been trying to get that on the Federal agenda for some time now.  </s>
<s> Canada does not have an equivalent to the ADA although there has been some talk about getting something going.  </s>
<s> Many Canadian laws have recently been amended to increase their "disability friendliness".  </s>
<s> None of these have any relationship to access to technology or information or accommodation.  </s>
<s> The Federal government is beginning a review of its internal policies relating to employees with disabilities.  </s>
