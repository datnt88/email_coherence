<s> It isn't.  </s>
<s> Try tabbing to (contents) "Preliminary Review" , tab to #prelim, tab again.... I've already raised this issue, and believe it is worth addressing.  </s>
<s> It does set a poor precedent.  </s>

<s> Jonathan, We're aware of this issue and have run some experiments with different browsers to try to isolate the problem, since navigation anomalies does not seem to be a problem in IE6 only, but to some extent in a few versions of other browsers as well.  </s>
<s> The next stage will be running some experiments with some different navigation options at the header -- beyond the many nav options that were initially tested last year for this design.  </s>
<s> It is being addressed, and your comments have been acknowledged on other lists already, but a new design isn't available yet.  </s>
<s> In the meantime we needed to get this page out for review.  </s>
<s> We will insert the new design once it's available &amp; has been tested.  </s>

<s> I have been advocating that content is not quite as important as WAI seems to believe it is, demonstration is at least as important.  </s>
<s> Judy may be in a rush to publish, however there is already a huge amount of material published by WAI on the web.  </s>
<s> Most of it is only accessible to a tiny minority of the population.  </s>
<s> There is yet to be any material published on the WAI site that is accessible to people with a learning difficulty.  </s>
<s> I've sent in a report suggesting that the WAI homepage be changed to only include one anchor per table cell.  </s>
<s> The W3C homepage follows this, and indeed I was thanked by its editor for making this report.  </s>
<s> I've not had an acknowledgement from WAI, and no action has been taken.  </s>
<s> I'll be looking into how tabbing navigation can be improved.  </s>
<s> However the editors current attitude is unlikely to encourage my efforts.  </s>
