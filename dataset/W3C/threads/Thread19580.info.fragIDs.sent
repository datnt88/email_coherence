could the User Interface treat the two elements as the same thing, rather than splitting them into two places?

I am afraid, that this exactly is The Bad Thing. 
See and better exaplantion of my point. 
I hope, that at least W3C supports the very ideas on which HTML is supposed to be based. 
However, if the idea was intended to just contrary (elimination of bold element as much as possible -- especially in toolbar), I would vote for. 
Have nice day Matthew 
Matej, I agree with you. 
Amaya handles B elements and STRONG elements. 
B is deprecated already in HTML 4. The logical thing to do with B elements is to convert them to STRONG elements. 
So, it would be good if the button which makes something strong could be overloaded, so that it can be used to remove STRONG or B from an element (but would always apply a STRONG). 
I suppose the alternative is that I should write a transformation that makes all B into STRONG. 
Seems like a pretty simple sed script to me.

[MCepl] if you mean something like what is grabbed by this screenshot of ADAPT -- ml or Online view of Word97, than I would be more than for. 
It would be marvelous and exactly, what I was hoping for. 
The structure view provides something like that (except it has a rendering bug, and you cannot collapse and expand elements). 
The Table of Contents is HTML Specific. 
It produces something like the outline view of word, based on nesting headings within each other.
