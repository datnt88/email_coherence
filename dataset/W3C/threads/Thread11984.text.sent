It was brought up at the last teleconference that it is very disconcerting to put a proposal to the list and get no response or only one response. 
When the responses are so sparse its not clear whether: - people disagree but don't want to stick their neck out - agree and think it is implied by their silence - think the proposal is too trite to respond to - haven't read the proposal - are too confused to respond - any other scenario, the imagination can go wild when there is a void and you get yourself into the right mindset. 
I propose that we try making this list a chattier, more friendly medium. 
When a proposal is tabled and you read it, please respond even if it only to echo what someone else has said or to say "sounds good but I need to think further on this" or to say "I absolutely hate it but I'm not sure why." 
So we can sift the responses from the added material, if you are responding and adding to the proposal please add a plus sign to the end of your subject head. 
This would look like this: Proposal subject head: Undeniably necessary addition Simple response without added stuff: Re: Undeniably necessary addition Response with counter proposal or added material: Re: Undeniably necessary addition + I propose we experiment with this for a few weeks and then decide whether it is helpful or cumbersome during the April 28 conference call. 
And people better respond to this proposal! 
Jutta I would actually suggest that we leave off the + sign, as having re: added to the subject line makes it clear enough already. 
It seems a bit of extra work that is not realy necessary. 
On the other hand, replying to a message, or keeping the subject line, are the two ways to ensure that it is threaded properly in the archives, which can be very helpful.

don't deserve an opinion. 
Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 I'm also busy doing other things nowadays and not spending enough time with AU. If the overall problem is: lack of participation, I'm not sure what you're proposing is the right answer. 
I also agree with Charles that breaking the threading by modifying the Subject line is not good. 
What would help people like me, who are interested but sometimes get out of synch with the WG (after a trip, or a busy period doing something else), would be to get a good summary situation, probably best would be off the WG Home page, as an addition to the issue list page for instance, giving the overall status, prioritized issues to be resolved, workplan, timeline, etc. 
This could also be sent to the list every 2 weeks. 
If the learning curve to get back in synch is fast, the better will be the participation IMHO. 
I think the concept that you are trying to address is good. 
Encouraging people to respond should help determine if consensus has been reached or not. 
I think people should feel free to respond to a thread even if the last message in the thread was a week ago (as I am doing now grin ). 
--w Probably the best guide to what needs attention now is to check meeting agendas, which are linked from the home page. 
Should I post these direct to the group as well? 
I definitely agree that the best way to get participation includes enabling people to get the required information fast, and the idea is to have that on the home page.
