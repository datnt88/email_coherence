Well, it still seems to be not quite there... 1) The sun/valid/out/optional.xml file needs to not end with a line break for the expected results comparison to work. 
This was either added by sending it as an attachment or introduced by a text editor, or perhaps even CVS, but the correct contents do not end with a line break. 
2) The sun invalid test descriptions still reference the file sun/invalid/not-sa03.xml, which is now a not-wf test. 
The reference needs to be moved/removed as appropriate. 
3) The ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml file is still referenced as a not-wf test despite being well-formed. 
As I mentioned in my previous note: "This file had been corrupted, see TS09 and TS13, but seems to have been fixed now. 
The test description needs to be changed back. 
diff -r xmlconf_orig/ibm/ibm_oasis_valid.xml xmlconf/ibm/ibm_oasis_valid.xml 29,30c29,31 TEST URI="valid/P02/ibm02v01.xml" TYPE="not-wf" ID ="ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml" ENTITIES="none" SECTIONS="2.2" Contains malformed UTF-8 characters. 
TEST URI="valid/P02/ibm02v01.xml" TYPE="valid" ID ="ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml" ENTITIES="none" SECTIONS="2.2" Tests B Char /B with 3 characters - 2 boundaries plus 1 in the middle - for each range plus #x20 #x9 #xD #xA Otherwise, things look okay. 
Best Regards, Glenn Thank you Glenn, I have no idea how the line break got in there but is removed, the other two are also fixed -- changes are committed to the CVS and the new download contains the changes. 
See the XML TS main page.

I noticed that the following line appears in xmlconf.xml 
TESTSUITE PROFILE="OASIS draft v1.0 Second Edition; with 15 March updates by Mary Brady)" We need to decide what this should really say. 
As far as I know, this is used to uniquely identify a release of the test suite so that when someone says they conform to the suite you can ask them to tell you which version they are using. 
This information needs to be different any time there is a public release of any changes so that we can maintain some sanity in supporting this stuff. 
Regards, Glenn
