<s> The draft says: @@ add something to Benefits about multiple versions vs one (accessible) version Something about this bothers me (but even after rewriting this message four  </s>

<s> Does anyone really think it is practical to create one page - even a properly/carefully/thoughtfully designed page - that can adequately serve a wide range of devices without device-specific style-sheets?  </s>
<s> In the abstract I still believe this is possible, but the most common complaint I hear against the theory is that such a page will produce sub-optimal renderings on some target devices.  </s>
<s> It begs the questions: is it of more benefit from a marketing/customer service standpoint to serve pages that are optimized for a range of customer's devices, or will the reduction in development and maintenance costs of one page outweigh this marketing consideration?  </s>
<s> If, on the other hand, what we really mean by "one accessible version" is one fixed content package associated with one or more sets of device-specific style sheet instructions then we have to be explicit in stating this.  </s>
<s> I guess I don't have enough confidence in the ability of current user-agents to adequately render even perfectly compliant markup and style without author-intervention.  </s>

<s> I think there's a big difference between a single page for all desktop computer browsers, or one that will work on all mobile phones, and one that will work across all devices.  </s>
<s> Many sites try to detect the browser and serve up separate versions, for MS IE and for Netscape, for example.  </s>
<s> This is the kind of duplication accessible design can avoid.  </s>
<s> But to try to make a page work on all devices is fighting a losing battle.  </s>
<s> I think that some sites will have to have multiple versions for different device profiles, but what we should claim is that each of these versions will be usable with all user agents and devices within that profile.  </s>

<s> It appears that this discussion brushes against the difference between "usable" and "capable of being used."  </s>
<s> While the former is subjective and squishy, the latter can be claimed by standards-conformant sites on all devices.  </s>
<s> The value of browsing a 2-megabyte file over a 9.6kbps connection through a four-line phone display notwithstanding.  </s>
<s> If sites are designed in a uniform fashion, and in a transformation-capable language such as XHTML, the case could be made that adhering to a common style (e.g., valid code, sections marked up with h* , alt text) affords the author the ability to transform the existing files in place for use by mobile or smaller displays using XSLT.  </s>
<s> I do tend to think most of the descriptions I've seen of this benefit are a bit overoptimistic or lacking in detail.  </s>
<s> You don't get this for free unless you plan for it.  </s>
<s> But relative to the jaw-dropping sums companies are happy to charge sites for screen-scraping services, it may sell some people, or at least get them thinking more about their designs.  </s>
<s> And that dovetails well with the Quality Assurance activity and their documents on designing for standards.  </s>

<s> I agree entirely with Matt, but am not sure quite how to restate this last section and its sub-points.  </s>
<s> W R T this point we tried very hard with the Vision Australia redesign earlier this year to create a standards compliant home page (other still need some tweaking) that owuld be quite usable on all browsers.  </s>
