<s> Subject: error when clean html with tidy Hi, Michael  </s>
<s> Thanks for your help on "config.txt".  </s>
<s> It's good solution.  </s>
<s> When i run tidy to clean some html, i got one error indicating that  </s>
<s> a missing ' ' for end of tag ".  </s>
<s> But " a " is already included in  </s>
<s> TagTable.java.  </s>
<s> Because of this error, the output as clean result is a zero-length file.  </s>
<s> But i want the output file not to be a zero-content file.  </s>
<s> Is there any solution to avoid this?  </s>
<s> Tidy is supposed to overcome this case, is it?  </s>

<s> Can you send a snippet of your HTML w/ the meta and a tags that Tidy is complaining about?  </s>
<s> You may unbalanced quotes or some other problem that has confused it.  </s>

<s> This sounds like you are specifying XML input to Tidy.  </s>
<s> Please be sure that you haven't setXMLTags to true.  </s>

<s> thanks for reply.  </s>

<s> At the beginning of each file, you can see the url link address for this url file.  </s>
<s> I already took out these extra lines before I use Tidy to clean this url file.  </s>
<s> I cannot see any clue to figure out why the error happans.  </s>

<s> Please show how you're invoking Tidy and what the exact error messages are.  </s>

<s> I have seen some horrible HTML generated in my time, but those 2 documents  </s>
<s> are terrible, and I'm not surprized Tidy has a problem.  </s>
<s> Hopefully the HTML below won't get mangled by the mail.  </s>
<s> 1) "48-washington.edu"  </s>
<s> :  </s>
<s> (a) There are 3 body ... /body which are nested.  </s>

<s> If you fix this error, Tidy will produce output.  </s>
<s> (c) I won't comment on the rest of the horrible HTML code.  </s>
<s> 2) "42-upenn.edu"  </s>
<s> : (a) The A tag Tidy is complaining about is in the following (line #192) : line 192 column 5 - Error: a missing ' ' for end of tag line 192 column 59 - Error: discarding unexpected /a LI A href="http://www.arstechnica.com/"  </s>

<s> Size=-2 Ars Technica /FONT br  </s>
<s> Note the missing  .  </s>
<s> And the extra /A .  </s>
<s> If you fix this error, Tidy will produce output.  </s>
<s> I used the current (23 Aug 01) C version of Tidy, so you might see different behaviour from an older version.  </s>
<s> But as I see it, Tidy tells you exactly what and where the error is - all you need to do is look at the rest of the line that Tidy is complaining about, to see the problem,.  </s>

<s> Hi, Gary The java file I used to invoke tidy is almost the same one as the example file offered by Tidy package.  </s>
<s> It is attached.  </s>
<s> I am not too sure now whether i need to set XMLtags to be false explicitly.  </s>
<s> Because I think the default for it is already false, is it? the error message is shown in err output file from tidy.  </s>
<s> The result is that the cleaned file as output will be zero length, which i don't like.  </s>

<s> HTML Tidy told you there is a missing ' ' because there *IS* a missing ' '.  </s>
<s> How about that?  </s>
<s> The letter "v" points to the place where the ' ' should have been.  </s>
<s> Not only that, the A is ended twice.  </s>
<s> It looks as though the first ' /A ' on line 195 should have been ' '.  </s>
<s> Note for the discerning: the appearance of ' FONT SIZE=-2 is an extremely reliable indicator of a page written by the HTML-clueless, and so it proves.  </s>
<s> This is a page that badly needs the attentions of Tidy.  </s>
