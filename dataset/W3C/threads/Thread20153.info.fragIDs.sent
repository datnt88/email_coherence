whien i use winzip 7.0 to try to unzip sources i get a message saying "please enter the full name of file within amaya-src-2_1_tar.gz and it defaults to amaya-src-2_1_tar. 
trying the default unzips into a 22 meg block but doesnt break it down any further and i am in the blind as to what other step to follow 
or what name to have given at the name it stage ... it seems that this is quite awkward compared to .zip programs which simply prompt for a directory (with appropriate one like program files\amaya\src as a default and then just unpackages each little file where it should go if someone has done it with tar.gz format successfully to a windows 95 system then perhaps they can offer notes up on the download site ....

There is a second step required here. the .gz 
extension refers to the fact that a file (amaya-src-2_1_tar) has been compressed using the gzip algorithm, which Winzip understands. 
in fact that file itself is an archive format (a "tar file" or "tarball" in common unix parlance) which has been generateed in a similar manner to a winzip collection of files. 
I believe that Winzip will allow you to extract the files from the tarball in a seperate step (in Unix systems it is a one step process), in much the way you have described below.

this is covered on the gzip faq page I mentioned before I think. 
Anyway, if you cannot persuade Winzip to read this then you can get Gnu Tar (described at: Available from: ftp://ftp.cs.ubc.ca/mirror2/gnu/tar/ nearest to you) This can unpack the whole thing in one step tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz but it is best to do tar -ztvf filename.tar.gz first to make sure that things will be be created where you want. 
t means table of contents. 
.tgz 
== .tar.gz by the way.

I guess the problem comes from the manner you download the tar file. 
Could you check to download with ftp and then apply winzip ?

Hi John, 
The original name of the tar file is amaya-src2.1.tar.gz unfortunately Windows renames it to amaya-src-2_1_tar.gz and WinZip does not understand that it is a gzipped tar file. 
So you have to rename it to amaya-src2_1.tar.gz and then use WInzip and it will work.

I believe ".tgz" will also let WinZip know it's a .tar.gz file. 
You might want to use that extension for that reason.

Good suggestion. 
We'll change in the next release.
