<s> I would like (as a member of EOWG) to find out which aspects of the EO effort (if any) affected the company's awareness of and attempts to improve accessibility problems in the product?  </s>
<s> Did this decision come about from concerns raised about inaccessibility by people like us?  </s>
<s> Did U.S. and various state regulations play a role?  </s>
<s> Did the business case arguments resonate with the management?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> These are good questions, and I am not sure that I have a sense of the answers.  </s>
<s> I guess in a more general sense an idea of what is helpful in getting the message across to developers is what I am looking for - most particularly from the developers on this list.  </s>
<s> I guess the answers will vary... cheers Charles  </s>
