I'm expect this question has already been asked, but I could not find it in my search through the archives... 
The spec for the getElementsByTagNameNS method of the Element interface strikes me as strange. 
Particularly the part, "in a preorder traversal of the Document tree starting from this node". 
I would have expected something more like the spec for getElementsByTagName, "in a preorder traversal of the Element tree". 
What is the intent of including Nodes from outside the Element's subtree in the returned NodeList? 
thanks, Seth The spec for the getElementsByTagNameNS method of the Element interface I'm sure that's just a typo. 
getElementsByTagNameNS is supported on both Element and Document, and the text wasn't updated when it was copied from one to the other. 
Good catch! 
Is there anything else that strikes you as strange? 
It's supposed to be a simple adaptation of getElementsByTagName to the namespaces world... Joe Kesselman / IBM Research My mistake. 
It comes from the text I copied from the method on Document. 
I fixed the spec. 
Thanks.
