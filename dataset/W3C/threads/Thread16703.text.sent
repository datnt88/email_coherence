after further investigation I found a way to use this site without JavaScript Here are URLs I tested: Sports: Figure Skating Links from the frontpage: Variety is the spice of life (or try any other) As it was mentioned already, Lynx doesn't have JS and therefor it doesn't need any special tuning - you can launch these URLs directly. 
It would be nice if someone (with good Lynx experience) can try these links BINGO, it worked pretty much as good as any I have seen recently in Lynx, now I didn't follow all the links but enough to get a feel and everything seemed to come up without hassle. 
two questions why aren't these URL advertised and I didn't see anything about the Paralympics, is there anything on the main pages Bob ASCII Ribbon Campaign accessBob NO HTML/PDF/RTF in e-mail accessys@smartnospam.net NO MSWord docs in e-mail Access Systems, engineers NO attachments in e-mail, *LINUX powered* access is a civil right THIS message and any attachements are CONFIDENTIAL and may be privledged.

as soon as I go to the site I get the warning that "Javascript must be enabled to visit this site" LYNX and Javascript don't seem to get along too well or is it just me not using it right???? after further investigation I found a way to use this site without JavaScript Here are URLs I tested: Sports: Figure Skating Links from the frontpage: Variety is the spice of life (or try any other) As it was mentioned already, Lynx doesn't have JS and therefor it doesn't need any special tuning - you can launch these URLs directly. 
I was using Konqueror (and it has JavaScript), so I disabled it first (globally). 
And those URLs I extracted from JavaScript and generated frame-page. 
Launching them "directly" had no side effect. 
(if you try these URLs with JS, JS will auto-redirect you to frame-based layout) All images stored on (and loaded from) Akamai - do not have 'alt' property. 
The rest is _typical_ FrontPage-generated HTML. 
It would be nice if someone (with good Lynx experience) can try these links and share his thoughts. 
After all, can blind people get at least something, or they will be completely lost in countless tables/TD/TR tags? 
he-he, try also http://www.oracle.com 
without JS. Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes this question is easy to answer :-(( They sell *banners*, every new hit displays new banner (or 2-3 banners) Javascript on main page _forces_ you to see site _exactly_ in way they need (you see all banners, preferable search engine, link to MSNBC.com, joint venture of NBC and MSN.com, etc.) Turning Off JavaScript you take-off their banners... 
That's why it's said "JavaScript is required to see NBCOlumpics.com" 
There is no other _technical_ requiremnt, as far as I can conclude from their code. 
don't know about that. 
I think it was in "GAMES" section, don't remember.
