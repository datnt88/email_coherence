<s> Hey, I just installed amaya 8pre openGL for win just after some1 posted a news on linuxfr.org.  </s>
<s> As I'm interressed on SVG topic, I installed it, it was quick and everything went fine.  </s>
<s> But as I launched it I got warnings : "your system requires more virtual memory" ... then the location bar and all th icons were greyish ...  </s>
<s> I turned all the other app off and try to go to linuxfr.org .  </s>
<s> It froze and gave no response to the system.  </s>
<s> My work PC is an old P2 500 with 256M RAM + winXP.  </s>
<s> I'll try it at home on my linux box as soon as I have a decent connection.  </s>
<s> Nerf  </s>
<s> There is a bug on winXP and OpenGL, that might depend on 3d hardware: Could you precise what Video Card you have ?  </s>
<s> There is an inifinite loop somewhere when rendering linuxfr.org,  </s>
<s> We'll work on it.  </s>
<s> the bug on linuxfr is on all platform but you could try SVG animation, until the final amaya 8 version Thanks for the report.  </s>
