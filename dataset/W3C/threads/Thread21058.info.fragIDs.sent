Hey, I just installed amaya 8pre openGL for win just after some1 posted a news on linuxfr.org. 
As I'm interressed on SVG topic, I installed it, it was quick and everything went fine. 
But as I launched it I got warnings : "your system requires more virtual memory" ... then the location bar and all th icons were greyish ... 
I turned all the other app off and try to go to linuxfr.org . 
It froze and gave no response to the system. 
My work PC is an old P2 500 with 256M RAM + winXP. 
I'll try it at home on my linux box as soon as I have a decent connection.

There is a bug on winXP and OpenGL, that might depend on 3d hardware: Could you precise what Video Card you have ? 
There is an inifinite loop somewhere when rendering linuxfr.org, 
We'll work on it. 
the bug on linuxfr is on all platform but you could try SVG animation, until the final amaya 8 version Thanks for the report.
