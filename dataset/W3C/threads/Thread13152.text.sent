1. 
One of the icons of the navitation bar has an alt="arrow". 
It is the icon for "wai resources". 
This text alternative seems not clear to me. 
2. In the section on "techniques", the first link refers to "Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests". 
Is there a reason to have placed this document as the first link of the list (to underline the importance of this document). 
All other lists of documents (guidelines, frequently asked questions..." begin with links to documents about the guidelines. 
I think it would be more logical to first have links to the guidelines techniques and to have after that the link to other documents such as "Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests". 
3. The link to "Logos for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines " does not work (no change to last week). 
Some of my colleagues tested this link with other versions of IE, and they have the same error message as Henk indicated last week. 
4. The link to "Frequently Asked Questions on Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) does not work. 
It links to : "2000/02/ATAG-faq". 
I get the message that my browser cannot open the page. 
Regards Sylvie
