Thank you Kelly! 
I think you have cut the Gordian Knot here! 
We have really been debating about the definition of accessibility here. 
Some are equating "accessible" with "understandable" and others with "available". 
I run into the latter frequently when I talk to other state agencies about if their programs are accessible, and they respond with something like, "Yes, we have locations in every county". 
This is equivalent with the argument that, "Well your computer CAN get that .GIF file, can't it? 
See, it IS accessible to you." Accessible means more than available. 
Unfortunately, the WCAG defines what it means by "web content" but not "accessibility". 
I think we would be doing the WAI a favor by defining this term a little more explicitly! 
I'll start us out with a couple of definitions (this needs work)... Accessible: Available and usable with appropriate assistive technology. 
Accessible: Functional to persons with disabilities by the same means (assistive technology) by which they routinely use their personal computer for other mainstream information technology related activities. 
I don't like either of these definitions because they are tied too strongly to disability, and don't generically address persons who use text browsers by choice (or for other reasons). 
At least both definitions get us past the current accessible==understandable bottleneck/misunderstanding/impasse that we are currently at! 
Both definitions are also less than satisfactory because they don't address how "accessible" is used on the WAI site, where the broader "available" connotation is implied. 
I am not aware of any formal (dictionary) definition of "accessible" that includes PWD or AT. 
I like the reference to assistive technology because, as Kelly Ford points out, all current working definitions of "accessibility" (with regard to disability) require (implicitly or explicitly) compatibility with "appropriate accommodations". 
This definition also neatly gets past the issue with learning disabilities because, as AT improves (to allow general computer use by people with LD), web sites that follow the WCAG (even as currently written) WILL be usable by persons with LD. 
The advent of HTML marked the first (well, most significant anyway) time that a completely competent computer user with appropriate assistive technology (e.g., a blind person with a screen reader) could encounter insurmountable obstacles (e.g., missing ALT tags), even though s/he had full access to all his hardware and software (i.e., Internet browser). 
THAT is why the WCAG is needed! 
Accessible means something different than usable. 
Accessible means MORE than available. 
Accessible means LESS than understandable.

Subject: Re: QED &amp; Marshall McLuhan Date: Friday, June 11, 1999 11:38 AM After reading the past several days on this topic, it seems reasonably obvious to me that something is necessary for some segment of the population with cognitive disabilities who has the ability to access the web to understand what they are accessing. 
What is still not obvious to me is exactly what that something is. 
I have a couple other thoughts to toss into the ring. 
As I mentioned before I am blind. 
Even the most accessible web site around will not be available to me without a screen reader or some sort of talking web browser. 
I don't think we'd expect that the W3 guidelines on accessibility would require each web site to build some sort of self-voicing capability into the site that gives me the flexability and independence that a screen reader or talking web browser affords. 
I wonder if the solution to the barriers faced by those with cognitive disabilities falls into the same category. 
Do we need some sort of assistive technology that can tailor information to the cognitive ability of different populations. 
I realize that such doesn't exist today but perhaps some sort of translator could be explored. 
To me accessibility has to include some measure of practicality of the solutions being proposed. 
Here in the US we don't expect every citizen to own a TDD to allow someone with a hearing impairment to communicate with anyone on demand. 
Instead we all, through a tax on our phone bill, fund the TDD relay system which allows telephone operators to handle this task. 
We don't expect a college professor to give his lecture with his or her voice and with sign language at the same time. 
Instead we bring a trained interpreter or realtime captioning into the lecture. 
None of this is meant to say that solutions at the content level shouldn't be explored. 
But what I don't hear is a systematic solution that I can take to web site developers and say do these things to make your site accessible to this population. 
I'd bet that the majority of people writing content for the web have not clue one about what grade level their content is written at and how to effectively change it to a different level as just one example. 
When looking for a definition, a good starting place is a dictionary. 
My handy Random House Webster's gives the definition of "accessible" as: "1. 
Easy to approach, reach, enter, speak with, or use. 
2. able to be used, entered, or reached. 
3. obtainable, attainable (accessible evidence). 
4. Readily understandable. 
5. open to the influence of (accessible to bribary)." 
Definition #4 is relevent to this discussion, and, at least in this dictionary, the meaning of accessibility clearly includes understanding. 
In my mind at least, there has never been a question that understanding is a part of accessibility, and I have been quite surprised that understanding is considered something other than a part of accessibility.

Enabling Support Foundation You had to go to the 4th definition in order to find something that supports your equation of "accessibility" and "understandability" though. 
Note that the first one doesn't speak of understanding, just of ease of _access_. 
The second says _able_ to be used, not a guarantee of understanding. 
The third says "obtainable" which does _not_ imply understanding. 
Finally in the fourth definition, you hit yours; then you come to one that says web content must be bribable? 
If you want to play this dictionary game, we can, but are you really calling for web sites to be open to corruption? 
My definition: A web site is accessible if the information contained in the content is not denied to any user. 
This is separate from the actual _understanding_, meaning that a web site could be perfectly _accessible_ to me but not _understandable_ by me, and that's just fine.

I don't think we can just pick the deffinition we want to apply and then apply it to anything we want. 
In this paradigm, the distinction between accessibility and understandability is clearly different. 
Other wise, we'll find that all the publishers in the world must rewrite all the books in the world. 
we must choose the deffinition that fits the context rather than finding a deffinition that we like and trying to drive it into a whole into which it does not fit.

---sig off--- I think this is a fascinating exercise... nailing down a definition -- or a set of definitions -- for accessibility. 
Clearly the answer is not going to be straightforward. 
Here is a definition for universal web page design that I came up with a couple of years ago: "Universal Web-page design means considering the needs of all people, and incorporating features useful to people with and without disabilties. 
A site, page, or feature is accessible if it can be used by everyone, including people with sensory, mobility and learning disabilities; people with injuries; children; and seniors." 
I am bothered by one aspect of my definition -- and Kynn's -- and I have not yet resolved it. 
Accessibility is never absolute. 
Nothing is 100% accessible. 
Is it meaningful to frame accessibility in terms of "all people" and "everybody?" 
There will always be individuals, due to disability or poor design, who will not be able to "get the message." 
The goal of web designers is to create environments that maximize the chances that everyone will have access to information, with an understanding that we will not be 100% successful. 
But it's better to aim high and miss some people than to be haphazard and miss a lot of people. 
It may also be helpful to frame a definition of accessibility in terms of usability. 
However, both usability and accessibility need be understood in relation to real, live people. 
(Warmware, to the geeks!) The question becomes: accessible to/usable by which people? 
My reflexive answer is: As many people as possible, and certainly not to the exclusion of those who have sensory, mobility, learning (and cognitive?) disabilities.

That bothers me as well, but I realize that complete, 100% universal accessibility is my _goal_. 
It's what I strive for, and I can't just accept "Well, no page will be accessible to everyone, so I won't bother." 
I believe that the goal should always be "as much as possible, within the limits of ability" and how limiting that should be is a personal decision for the author, based on knowledge of web design, understanding of the issues, a desire to do what's right, and a sense of empathy. 
There is a "practical limit" to how accessible a web page can be made, in most cases, based on how much time, energy, and money needs to be invested. 
In most cases, this amount is TRIVIAL, especially compared to the overall benefits, and an _informed_ web author will know his. 
ALT text is TRIVIAL to do; there's absolutely no reason that, if done from the start of a project, it should not be done. 
However, if you weren't aware of web accessibility 3 years ago and your graphics heavy site is lacking ALT text -- do you _need_ to go back and redo it? 
The "principle" -- the higher goal to which we hold ourselves -- says "yes, it is essential for accessibility." 
However, the practical side of life may tell me that going through 1,000 pages and adding individual ALT text could take me literally days to weeks, and financial and personal decisions must be made. 
In these cases, the practical WILL outweigh the principle, regardless of whether or not we personally wish otherwise. 
If I have a huge site I will not spend 100 hours correcting it, even if I know I "should," unless I have compelling reasons to do otherwise. 
It's a benefits-vs-investment issue, like nearly any other decision I may have to make about my web site -- such as how to market it or how often to update it. 
Our goal should _always_ be accessibility. 
Will we meet that goal? 
No, and as Alan has pointed out, by definition there will be times that we simply CAN'T. 
But we must always strive for a bar higher than what we are comfortable with, and we must push ourselves to make those little efforts even if the huge efforts are currently beyond our reach. 
That's my take on the "absoluteness" of accessibility. 
It's not a particularly "firm" guideline, but rather a personal one.

Similiarly we are creating videos explaining issues such as sexuality that previously were only discussed textually. 
This will not be achieved overnight . 
however it is importat to recognise the need. 
It is essential that the guideline authors (or at least oneof them) have personal experience of this to plan and encourage.

bribary)." 
Sorry you don't like the book's example. 
It could read "accessible to love", or "accessible to knowledge", for example, as well as "accessible to bribary". 
The point is that "readily understandable" is part of the definition of "accessibility". 
Dictionaries are not a "game", they are at the root of understanding the terms we are using to define which people go to the web ghetto. 
Anne Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation That's all those on the list who have or have family with learning disabilities and cognitive differences are asking you to do. 
Strive to set the bar higher than you are now comfortable with, and accommodate ever increasing numbers of people to the web. 
The first step up on that raised bar is to begin to include meaningful graphics on pages with text. 
Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation I believe the point Kynn is trying to make is that it is an argumentative and logical fallacy to simply point to the dictionary and say "See...it says so right here!
