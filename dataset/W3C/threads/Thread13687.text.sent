I'm incorporating content hashing into the Site Valet problem reporting and tracking database, as a system-determined measure of what has changed when a page is updated: * User asserts [some aspect of page] needs fixing * Valet makes hash on [that aspect] * Valet checks again when webmaster claims to have fixed it I'm not sure how useful this will be, but it's one step up from purely manual inspection. 
For this, I've switched from Base64 to hex for the hashes, to make my own parsing easier. 
The two are of course functionally equivalent. 
Anyway, can I ask folks to take a look at the system: does it look basically sensible as it stands: * Go to any page displaying the Site Valet badge (e.g. http://valet.webthing.com/qa/) 
* Click on the badge to get a report * Click on the "comment on this page" link * Does this Form make sense to you?

Yep, the form made sense to me. 
Do you have a pet test page (test toy gets report, randomly changes the page, ...)?

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Interesting idea - I'll have a think about that. 
Though it'll probably go somewhere other than the live system, unless I can do it on the same principle as /invalid.html.
