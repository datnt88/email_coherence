<s> DOM implementations will typically be able to build a tree from an XML document (or stream of SAX events) in a manner that both DOM Level 1 calls and DOM Level 2 calls will behave reasonably.  </s>
<s> However, there is no guarantee that a public user of a DOM implementation can build a tree using *NS methods and accessing using the non NS methods or vice-versa.  </s>
<s> Any level 2 parser should call level 2 methods, hence it should call setNamedItemNS in preference to setNamedItem.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, it would not properly detect namespace non-well-formedness problems that come from a document that cannot be represented in terms of level 2 DOM, i.e. where two attributes have the same prefix which map to the same namespaceURI, which can be detected by testing for a non-null return from setNamedItemNS.  </s>
