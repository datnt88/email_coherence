Terje told me to be careful with fixing spelling errors. 
Some tags still appear as upper case in error messages, e.g. the H1 and H6 in: Below is an outline for this document, automatically generated from the heading tags ( code H1 /code through code H6 /code .) Because of XHTML, I think all tag names should be lower case. 
Anybody differing? 
regards, Martin. 
Nope, not at all. 
:-) My comments about spelling changes was related to capitalization of terms. 
e.g. 
I tend to capitalize "Validate" and "Validator" to stress the fact that these are terms with special meaning outside of their normal English meaning. 
I'm ready to be convinced this is a Bloody Stupid[tm] thing to do, but I'd prefer if y'all didn't define them as simple typos and "fix" them willy-nilly. 
Convince me it's stupid (so I stop putting them in) and lets fix _all_ of them in one go if we're to change them at all. 
Consistency and all that... :-) Fixed. 
And lets do all other such instances as we find them. 
Ladies and gentlemen, you must resist those all-too-human feelings and decide this case on the evidence. 
And the evidence plainly shows that Mr. Landa's injuries, disfiguring as they are, are nowhere near as important to a free society as the fundamental right to make smart-ass remarks.
