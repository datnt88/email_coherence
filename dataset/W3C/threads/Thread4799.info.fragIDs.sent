Oofah -- I just noticed when I tried to check in to CVS. 
At any rate, I made the title change you suggested, and I guess it'll get checked in at some point. 
Kendall 
I suppose I should let this go, but I find it oddly annoying. 
"Kendall", please, if at all possible. 
: Thanks, Kendall 
If there is one item we could agree before publishing, I would suggest: "4.1 Human-friendly Syntax" As it makes it clear to the audience we intend to produce this as a concrete output. 
At the F2F it had strong support, possibly because of this, it has had much discussion since. 
It would not exclude other syntaxes.

Dan, As mentioned in the last telecon my regrets (traveling, actually have to take a plane in the next few hours and so will not have a lot of sleep but this is because I'm reading a very interesting thesis at http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~gwat/thesis/) 
I would vote to publish the current version of as our working draft.
