<s> Hello, In the 14 October draft [1], G4 reads: "Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content"  </s>
<s> I propose changing this to: "Provide ways to check for and correct inaccessible content"  </s>
<s> A couple of reasons: - I don't like "methods" here.  </s>
<s> Method implies for me some methodology.  </s>
<s> I believe what is meant here is "service" or "tool" or "feature" or something similar.  </s>
<s> I propose "way" since it's a little less specific than "service".  </s>
<s> - I think "check" should be "check for" anyway.  </s>
<s> - None of the other guidelines use gerunds (not important, but still) - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19991014 Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> makes better sense and grammar to me.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins,  </s>
<s> I like it too.  </s>
