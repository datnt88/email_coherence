My action item was to look at the success criteria for 3.5: "Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with summaries and definitions." 
The guideline currently has the following success criteria and issues: Success criteria: 1. a definition or link to a definition is provided for phrases, words, acronyms, and abbreviations specific to a particular community. 
Issue: Should this criterion be restricted to the first occurrence of an acronym or abbreviation, as in WCAG 1.0? 
2. a summary is provided for - relationships among cells for tables with nested headings, - relationships among cells that span multiple columns or rows, - or other relationships that may not be obvious from analyzing the structure of the table but that may be apparent in a visual rendering of the table. 
A summary may also describe how the table fits into the context of the current document. 
Issue: the second success criterion is very specific to tables. 
Can it be generalized? 
Issue: What other applications of the principle enunciated by this checkpoint should be included in the success criteria? 
How can the criteria be improved? 
Success criteria 1: It is testable. 
I suggest modifying it to state that all acronyms and abbreviations should be defined, not just those specific to a particular community. 
In response to the issue about how often to provide the definition, I think that providing the definition when the term is first used is sufficient. 
If you provided the definition with every occurrence, the document could become cumbersome. 
Redundant links to definitions could be distracting, especially if the term is used often. 
Success criteria 2: As it is written, it is not testable because 1. 
It is not clear what constitutes a summary. 
2. It is not clear what types of tables warrant a summary. 
3. The third bullet that talks about summarizing a table with relationship that are not obvious is subjective. 
Regarding #1 - We need to be clear about what a summary is. 
Does it mean referencing the table within the text of the document? 
What if the whole page is about one table - is a summary really needed, or does the entire page count as the summary? 
Regarding #2 - The success criteria lists 3 things to summarize. 
If we're saying that only tables with these items need to be summarized, I think we should word it like: "Provide a summary for tables with nested heading and/or cells that span multiple columns or rows. 
The summary should explain the relationship between the cells." 
Regarding #3 - Deciding whether or not a "relationship is obvious" is not testable because it depends on the person evaluating the page. 
I think it should be omitted or put in a "non-testable" section. 
In response to the issue about other applications that require summaries, here's a list: - Visual representations of data, such as a graph (e.g., a line graph) or chart (e.g., bar chart) - Diagrams (e.g., network topology) These items should be supported with a summary to explain their context or purpose. 
In addition to the text equivalent (checkpoint 1.1)? 
Awhile ago, there was some discussion about the testability of 3.5. 
Thanks for the comments and sorry for the delayed response! 
Here's a list of the proposed success criterion and a list of related issues. 
I'd like to discuss this checkpoint on an upcoming conference call. 
Success criteria 1: My proposed wording is: "A definition or link to a definition is provided for phrases, words, acronyms and abbreviations for the first occurrence on each page." 
Issue: 
1. Should the definition appear with the first occurrence on each page or site? 
Proposed resolution - On each page, because a user will not navigate through a site in any particular order. 
Success criteria 2: My proposed wording is: "Provide a summary for tables with nested heading and/or cells that span multiple columns or rows. 
The summary should explain the relationship between the cells." 
Issues: 1. 
We need to define what constitutes a summary. 
a. 
At a minimum, the definition could be that some reference to the table be made within the text of the document. 
However, how can we make the definition of a summary more meaningful? 
b. Can the success criteria state that the summary should be explicitly tied to the table? 
If yes, then one suggestion is for the HTML technique to use CAPTION or LABEL FOR  . 
Will these meet our needs? 
Are there other techniques for other technologies? 
2. Does the success criteria cover everything? 
What about number of cells? 
Is it feasible to define an exact number of cells that warrants a summary? 
3. Is a summary always necessary? 
For instance, if the whole page is about one table - is a summary really needed, or does the entire page count as the summary? 
4. Should the checkpoint apply to both data tables and layout tables? 
Research is needed as to whether or not layout tables should have a summary. 
(for instance, magnifier users). 
I'll look into this. 5. In the current draft, there is third bullet to success criteria #2 about a relationship being "obvious". 
Can we make this testable? 
Possibly the HTML algorithm, per Wendy: 6. What other applications should be included in the success criteria? 
Proposed resolution: I had originally proposed that visual representations of data and diagrams have a summary. 
I retract this now, and agree with the comments that this is covered by checkpoint 1.1. 
I don't have any other suggestions, does anyone else have some ideas? 
If not, we should remove this as an issue from the current draft. 
Thanks. 
As a dyslexic, I think that it needs to be all over. 
I have no visual memory, so it is very hard to find your way to the first reference and then find your way back. 
If the acronyms are similar (bp and mp) it can become beyond me to tell one from the other without copying it down double checking, and then starting my search.
