<s> My action item was to look at the success criteria for 3.5: "Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with summaries and definitions."  </s>
<s> The guideline currently has the following success criteria and issues: Success criteria: 1. a definition or link to a definition is provided for phrases, words, acronyms, and abbreviations specific to a particular community.  </s>
<s> Issue: Should this criterion be restricted to the first occurrence of an acronym or abbreviation, as in WCAG 1.0?  </s>
<s> 2. a summary is provided for - relationships among cells for tables with nested headings, - relationships among cells that span multiple columns or rows, - or other relationships that may not be obvious from analyzing the structure of the table but that may be apparent in a visual rendering of the table.  </s>
<s> A summary may also describe how the table fits into the context of the current document.  </s>
<s> Issue: the second success criterion is very specific to tables.  </s>
<s> Can it be generalized?  </s>
<s> Issue: What other applications of the principle enunciated by this checkpoint should be included in the success criteria?  </s>
<s> How can the criteria be improved?  </s>
<s> Success criteria 1: It is testable.  </s>
<s> I suggest modifying it to state that all acronyms and abbreviations should be defined, not just those specific to a particular community.  </s>
<s> In response to the issue about how often to provide the definition, I think that providing the definition when the term is first used is sufficient.  </s>
<s> If you provided the definition with every occurrence, the document could become cumbersome.  </s>
<s> Redundant links to definitions could be distracting, especially if the term is used often.  </s>
<s> Success criteria 2: As it is written, it is not testable because 1.  </s>
<s> It is not clear what constitutes a summary.  </s>
<s> 2. It is not clear what types of tables warrant a summary.  </s>
<s> 3. The third bullet that talks about summarizing a table with relationship that are not obvious is subjective.  </s>
<s> Regarding #1 - We need to be clear about what a summary is.  </s>
<s> Does it mean referencing the table within the text of the document?  </s>
<s> What if the whole page is about one table - is a summary really needed, or does the entire page count as the summary?  </s>
<s> Regarding #2 - The success criteria lists 3 things to summarize.  </s>
<s> If we're saying that only tables with these items need to be summarized, I think we should word it like: "Provide a summary for tables with nested heading and/or cells that span multiple columns or rows.  </s>
<s> The summary should explain the relationship between the cells."  </s>
<s> Regarding #3 - Deciding whether or not a "relationship is obvious" is not testable because it depends on the person evaluating the page.  </s>
<s> I think it should be omitted or put in a "non-testable" section.  </s>
<s> In response to the issue about other applications that require summaries, here's a list: - Visual representations of data, such as a graph (e.g., a line graph) or chart (e.g., bar chart) - Diagrams (e.g., network topology) These items should be supported with a summary to explain their context or purpose.  </s>
<s> In addition to the text equivalent (checkpoint 1.1)?  </s>
<s> Awhile ago, there was some discussion about the testability of 3.5.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments and sorry for the delayed response!  </s>
<s> Here's a list of the proposed success criterion and a list of related issues.  </s>
<s> I'd like to discuss this checkpoint on an upcoming conference call.  </s>
<s> Success criteria 1: My proposed wording is: "A definition or link to a definition is provided for phrases, words, acronyms and abbreviations for the first occurrence on each page."  </s>
<s> Issue:  </s>
<s> 1. Should the definition appear with the first occurrence on each page or site?  </s>
<s> Proposed resolution - On each page, because a user will not navigate through a site in any particular order.  </s>
<s> Success criteria 2: My proposed wording is: "Provide a summary for tables with nested heading and/or cells that span multiple columns or rows.  </s>
<s> The summary should explain the relationship between the cells."  </s>
<s> Issues: 1.  </s>
<s> We need to define what constitutes a summary.  </s>
<s> a.  </s>
<s> At a minimum, the definition could be that some reference to the table be made within the text of the document.  </s>
<s> However, how can we make the definition of a summary more meaningful?  </s>
<s> b. Can the success criteria state that the summary should be explicitly tied to the table?  </s>
<s> If yes, then one suggestion is for the HTML technique to use CAPTION or LABEL FOR  .  </s>
<s> Will these meet our needs?  </s>
<s> Are there other techniques for other technologies?  </s>
<s> 2. Does the success criteria cover everything?  </s>
<s> What about number of cells?  </s>
<s> Is it feasible to define an exact number of cells that warrants a summary?  </s>
<s> 3. Is a summary always necessary?  </s>
<s> For instance, if the whole page is about one table - is a summary really needed, or does the entire page count as the summary?  </s>
<s> 4. Should the checkpoint apply to both data tables and layout tables?  </s>
<s> Research is needed as to whether or not layout tables should have a summary.  </s>
<s> (for instance, magnifier users).  </s>
<s> I'll look into this. 5. In the current draft, there is third bullet to success criteria #2 about a relationship being "obvious".  </s>
<s> Can we make this testable?  </s>
<s> Possibly the HTML algorithm, per Wendy: 6. What other applications should be included in the success criteria?  </s>
<s> Proposed resolution: I had originally proposed that visual representations of data and diagrams have a summary.  </s>
<s> I retract this now, and agree with the comments that this is covered by checkpoint 1.1.  </s>
<s> I don't have any other suggestions, does anyone else have some ideas?  </s>
<s> If not, we should remove this as an issue from the current draft.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> As a dyslexic, I think that it needs to be all over.  </s>
<s> I have no visual memory, so it is very hard to find your way to the first reference and then find your way back.  </s>
<s> If the acronyms are similar (bp and mp) it can become beyond me to tell one from the other without copying it down double checking, and then starting my search.  </s>
