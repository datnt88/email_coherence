<s> Al:: As I read these two snippets, they say different things.  </s>
<s> So the second doesn't explain what the first meant.  </s>
<s> Al:: The way I read that injunction it says that the anchor, the sensitive text, should appear at or near the start of the text content of the LI element.  </s>
<s> By the way, this is a mixed blessing.  </s>
<s> It is good for Braille users and users of screen enlargers.  </s>
<s> Sighted people like it because the array of clickables falls in a neat, easily mouseable stack on the screen.  </s>
<s> But on the whole it has a negative effect in speech, where it is better to reverse this and put the action opportunity at the end of the explanation.  </s>
<s> Gregory Rosmaita has beat me up over this one regarding some pages we discussed.  </s>
<s> But of course, that has been overtaken by events as far as the current draft is concerned.  </s>
<s> The current text sounds like the standard advice to start paragraphs with topic sentences and sections with topic paragraphs.  </s>
<s> Good advice which can become critical under the stress of adverse access conditions.  </s>

<s> Hello, Our first attempt at phrasing a guideline was a narrow look at links.  </s>
<s> We were trying to make serial access (i.e. speech) as efficient as possible.  </s>
<s> Thus, if you have a list of links and the information that makes that link unique appears first, you should be able to more quickly select the appropriate link.  </s>
<s> For example, if i have a list of links to chapter headings, front loading the links with "chapter 1 - style sheets, chapter 2 - links, etc." slows down a user.  </s>
<s> They have to listen to repetitive information ("chapter") before getting to the meat of the link (chapter name).  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if we did something like, "Style sheets - chapter 2, Links - chapter 3, etc." they get the meat first.  </s>
<s> This is not the best example, but it should illustrate the problem.  </s>
<s> We were especially concerned about links because we've found that users of screen readers often tab through the links on the page as a way of skimming the contents.  </s>
<s> Upon further discussion we realized the statement applied to more than just links in lists.  </s>
<s> Thus, we broadened the recommendation to (hopefully) include "Good advice which can become critical under the stress of adverse access conditions."  </s>
<s> Are there other issues that we need to be aware of in regards to this guideline?  </s>
<s> Is it helpful?  </s>
<s> Necessary?  </s>
<s> Could it possibly create other problems?  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Wendy A Chisholm said:  </s>
<s> There is a related issue that has [to my knowledge with current technology] to be addressed at a site level.  </s>
<s> This has to do with the fact that users learn.  </s>
<s> As they learn they want less display information but when they first encounter a site or topic, they want a lot of context and explanation as they go.  </s>
<s> Computer application developers have taken to using "Cue cards" and related tricks to get users to participate with the tutorial sections of the help/learn subsystem when they are new.  </s>
<s> This lets the core controls which are always in the loop be relatively terse, optimized for the trained habitual user.  </s>
<s> Web sites have to provide some of this verbosity diversity, too.  </s>
<s> The "how to use this site" sub-web at www.microsoft.com is a good example of how one can do this.  </s>
<s> User needs are not static but shift as the same user uses the same site repeatedly.  </s>
<s> Since sites want not just to draw the first hit but to win repeat business, they have to provide a range of fast-vs-clear ways to use the site.  </s>
