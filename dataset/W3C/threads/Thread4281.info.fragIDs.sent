It seems to me that, at a fundamental level, there is a problem with the Namespaces in XML 1.0 Recommendation and the Namespaces in XML 1.1 specification. 
There is no mechanism defined to allow for change of any type in the names (or their implied characteristics) in a namespace. 
It is as if the WG had overlooked the inevitability of change of names and their characteristics over time. 
This becomes a substantive problem when different versions of a namespace-aware specification are defined. 
This problem affects, for example, XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0, if I understand the problem correctly, and will also affect all other namespace-aware specifications as they move beyond version 1.0. 
The problem is ironic since it was a purpose of the Namespaces in XML Recommendation to disambiguate element and attribute names. 
As an example, let's consider the name "apply-templates" in the XSLT Namespace. 
Is it unambiguously identified by the URI One aspect of the problem is that the name "apply-templates" in the XSLT Namespace identifies two entities with different characteristics, thus creating a new dimension of ambiguity. 
In XSLT 1.0 the name "apply-templates" implies, among other things, the characterisitic of not having an associated version attribute or an associated xpath-default-namespace attribute. 
In XSLT 2.0 the identical (same??) name implies the presence of both associated attributes. 
Similar considerations apply to other XSLT elements. 
Thus the namespace URI alone is insufficient to unambiguously identify an element type name and its associated characteristics. 
Having one name allegedly in the same namespace but with two different sets of characteristics seems to me to be a recipe for problems. 
Another difficulty arising from the same fundamental problem is deciding whether or not a name is present in or is absent from the XSLT namespace. 
Take the name "analyze-string" as an example. 
Is it in the namespace A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" fundamental ambiguity. 
XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 attempt to sidestep the issue by indicating that a version attribute provides unambiguous clarity. 
That may or may not be the case. 
However, the XSLT 2.0 specification also claims conformance with Namespaces in XML 1.0 where only the namespace URI is designated as the means to disambiguate names. 
It seems to me that it is not possible for XSLT 2.0 to claim conformance with Namespaces in XML 1.0 while at the same time using a disambiguating mechanism which circumvents the namespace URI as the disambiguating mechanism. 
It seems to me that either the Namespaces in XML specifications need to be changed to reflect the inadequacy of the namespace URI alone as a sufficient disambiguating mechanism or the XSLT 2.0 specification (and other namespace-aware specifications above version 1.0) need to indicate that they are using a disambiguating mechanism not defined in the Namespaces in XML specifications. 
Since I believe this is one of several issues related to the characteristics of XML namespaces which need review and that it impacts several XML technologies I am copying this to the TAG.

while such a mechanism would be useful, there is no reason to require that it be an inherent part of xml namespace specifications. 
the Namespaces in XML recommendations specify which element in the value domain (NCName x IRI) is denoted by a given lexical expression of the form NCName : NCName (more or less). 
This has nothing to do with what the interpretation which some other specification or an application applies to the name. 
the perception, that there is a problem, arises only if one confuses the identity of a name with its interpretation. 
every interpretation depends on a mechanism. 
if that mechanism, by its nature, imposes a "context" on an interpretation for its internal symbols, then it can effect a 1-1 map between universal names and internal symbols and must simply ensure that each interpretation happen in the correct context. 
if, on the other hand, the mechanism interprets all internal symbols globally, then it must establish contexts for interpreting the universal names and ensure that universal names map to the symbols which are associated with the specified interpretation. 
in order to ease the implementation, one could standardize descriptions for relations among the sets of names [see eg. none of this is "a problem". 
either of the above approaches will work. 
the serialization facilities in cl-http, for example [http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html], should be an adequate demonstration of how one can use packages to do this in a single binding context. 
[see description of the general approach] in no case is this a matter which an xml namespace standard must address. 
Namespaces are not about disambiguating the semantics of names, just names as such and their ownership. 
The fact that given a name in a namespace per XML Namespaces 1.0 you can't even tell whether it names an element, and attribute, an ID or all three already makes that clear. 
This is not a bug, it's a feature -- as Michael Kay says, interpretation is always context-bound, that's in the nature of names.

Quite right as to the general principle, but XML Names says an ID can't contain a colon, so there are no namespaced IDs.
