<s> Curt, Is there anything in the framework yet for creation of DOMInputStream/DOMReader ?  </s>
<s> We've discussed this a long time ago and I didn't have any change to see whether there was activity on this issue ?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Jeroen  </s>

<s> I just added support for the value parameter for DOMInputStream definitions to the Java framework.  </s>
<s> The value is expanded to a URL using the same logic as the load method and then the URL's openStream method is called.  </s>
<s> For example, would expand to: InputStream staffStream = openStream("staff"); Where DOMTestCase.openStream(String baseURL) would append the appropriate suffix and attempt to find the resource within the .jar  </s>
<s> file (unless the value contains a protocol).  </s>
<s> Hi there, I'm new to DOM and about to start a project work with it, as I've been reading about DOM, I always read the word Java Binding, but I don't really understand what it means, could anyone tell me?  </s>
<s> Thanks Asma Yahoo!  </s>
<s> Mail - For a better Internet experience  </s>
