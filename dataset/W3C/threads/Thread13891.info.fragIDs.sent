<s> I have some fairly effective spam filtering at webthing.com.  </s>
<s> But my dialup address, c/o my ISP, is completely unfiltered, and has recently started to get significant volumes *in spite of* being completely private.  </s>
<s> I've just got a message entitled "notabug.com".  </s>
<s> Since the name notabug rigns a bell, I actually read it, and it turned out to be "trafficmagnet" spam.  </s>
<s> That's blocked at Webthing, but checking the headers I found it was addressed to my unfiltered address.  </s>
<s> It appears to have been harvested from the #er chatlogs at notabug.  </s>
<s> Can I put in a plea for the administrators of notabug NOT to publish email addresses featured in IRC, as these may be (as in my case) a great deal more private and vulnerable than our "public" address.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Nick Kew  </s>
<s> In a quick search of the logs I couldn't find your email address.  </s>
<s> I'm  </s>
<s> happy to remove things from the logs if you can give me the date and time so I can find them.  </s>
<s> If you don't want things to be in the logs, start your line with [off].  </s>
<s> But if you're worried about spam, I suggest you get a real solution, like a Bayesian filter.  </s>
<s> Playing these silly email-address-hiding games don't solve much, in my experience.  </s>

<s> That's probably because you grepped for my _public_ address.  </s>
<s> nick@webthing.com is very public, and heavily spam-filtered.  </s>
<s> The address I'm bothered about is known only to a few individuals, and - I've just found out - appears in your logs every day:-(  </s>
<s> Totally irrelevant.  </s>
<s> The address appearing has nothing to do with anything I type.  </s>
<s> But you're logging my "local" address every time I join #er.  </s>
<s> I know that very well.  </s>
<s> But I have to have an ISP so that I can connect to the net.  </s>
<s> That's an old-fashioned modem, which is the only kind of connection available here.  </s>
<s> And with that comes an email address which I can't filter before the spam travels down my modem link.  </s>
<s> And I don't want to block it completely, because a very few people have it and use it legitimately, and because webthing.com  </s>
<s> forwards my legitimate mail to it for when I dialup.  </s>
<s> I'm not blaming you: none of us realised until now what was happening.  </s>
<s> But if you could add a regexp to strip email addresses when people join #er, you will cease to be a spam-magnet.  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> I see.  </s>
<s> You should configure your client not to send your real username when it connects.  </s>
