<s> Finding unexpected barriers online, many Internet users are pushing companies to make good on the promise of universal access.  </s>
<s> and Text follows: Disability Divide Finding unexpected barriers online, many Internet users are pushing companies to make good on the promise of universal access.  </s>
<s> By Karen Solomon You would never intentionally design a Web site to not be viewed by the state of Kentucky.  </s>
<s> Nor make it inaccessible to guys named Louie.  </s>
<s> But the vast majority of the Web arbitrarily excludes the 54 million disabled Americans, who constitute the largest national minority.  </s>
<s> When seasoned Web surfer Roger Petersen, whose vision is impaired, goes online to find health information or shop for CDs, he uses the most advanced screen-reading technology to help him view Web sites.  </s>
<s> But he still can't read a great portion of the Internet.  </s>
<s> "About half of the sites I visit I can really use, and another 25 percent I can partly use."  </s>
<s> The remainder of the Web is saddled with design specifications or technologies that make it unreadable to Petersen.  </s>
<s> A recent Harris poll found that disabled people go online and use e-mail twice as much as people without disabilities do.  </s>
<s> And nearly half of those with disabilities say the Internet has "significantly improved" the quality of their lives, as opposed to a quarter of those Internet surfers without disabilities who say the same thing.  </s>
<s> Yet access is a daily problem for Petersen and 3 million other disabled U.S. Web surfers.  </s>
<s> While the disabled benefit from using the Web, they still find as much frustration as information online, and they are pushing to make the Internet as universal as its boosters claim it to be.  </s>
<s> "It's a frustrating and irritating time for people with disabilities," says Cynthia Waddell, the Americans With Disabilities Act coordinator for the city of San Jose, Calif.  </s>
<s> She notes that while the rest of the Internet world is enjoying unprecedented convenience, the disabled have had to fight to bank online, vote online or even use America Online (AOL) .  </s>
<s> Medical transcriptionist Rose Combs is blind.  </s>
<s> She goes online daily to read e-mail and catch up with local news.  </s>
<s> Getting Internet access makes it "much easier for me to read my local news, do research and pick up tidbits of information," she wrote in a recent interview conducted through e-mail.  </s>
<s> "Also, I can keep in touch with family without spending a lot of money."  </s>
<s> But when Combs went online to vote in the Arizona Democratic primary, the first election to be held on the Web, her screen reader couldn't translate the Election.com  </s>
<s> Web site.  </s>
<s> This experience made an activist of Combs.  </s>
<s> "I honestly believe that it is my right to be able to vote in private just like the millions of other people in the nation."  </s>
<s> With assistance from the National Federation of the Blind, Combs successfully lobbied Election.com to make its online voting accessible to screen readers.  </s>
<s> Struggles like Combs' are slowly pushing companies to make changes.  </s>
<s> The ADA requires that communication, as well as public spaces, be accessible to the disabled, and on that basis the National Federation of the Blind sued America Online in November, claiming AOL isn't usable for those with vision impairments.  </s>
<s> While no one has ever gone to court for Net access under the ADA, advocate Waddell believes the AOL case could establish a precedent in the courts.  </s>
<s> For now, Net-access cases are being settled out of court.  </s>
<s> Roger Petersen and the California Council of the Blind negotiated a settlement with the Bank of America (BAC) to get ATMs and a disabled-accessible online banking site.  </s>
<s> Since the council took action, 15 talking ATMs have been installed, with 2,500 more scheduled in California and Florida over the next three years.  </s>
<s> While the Bank of America and Election.com  </s>
<s> victories are steps toward a disabled-accessible Internet, not all Web companies and institutions have been so quick to adapt to special needs.  </s>
<s> Browsing for a day without Java or images enabled will clue you in to the handicapped experience on the Web.  </s>
<s> Top brand sites are still surrounded by a mote of inaccessibility, from the cards at American Greetings (AM) to the groceries at Webvan to the sleek stylings of Fashionmall.com, the Gap or the Sharper Image (SHRP) .  </s>
<s> "The whole idea of Web accessibility is equivalent to putting ramps everywhere, but at the same time it's important to build wheelchairs that can climb stairs," says Petersen. Combs and Petersen rely on screen-reading programs such as JAWS, or text composition programs such as DragonFly, to make their home and work computers readable.  </s>
<s> Other adaptive technology includes text magnifiers, multimedia captioning and foot-powered or head-controlled mice and keyboards.  </s>
<s> But no matter how advanced technology becomes, says Petersen, "We also need site designers to consider their design.  </s>
<s> We need [these two technologies] to meet in the middle."  </s>
<s> Even with the assistance of the best adaptive technology, the basic construction of a Web site can keep some people from getting access, due to a lack of awareness of the disabled person's needs.  </s>
<s> Examples include sites that use Flash, animation and uncaptioned video or audio without any backup text explanation.  </s>
<s> Or sites using Java that hasn't been adapted for the handicapped.  </s>
<s> In short, the majority of big-ticket sites that sell, educate or entertain with glitter and glitz often exclude the disabled.  </s>
<s> "I've never thought about user interface from the perspective of a disabled user," says Web developer Kim Roche.  </s>
<s> "People don't consider it that important.  </s>
<s> When it's brought up in the workplace, it's quickly dismissed because people think [the disabled are] only a small percent of the population."  </s>
<s> But that perception is untrue.  </s>
<s> With 3 million disabled people in the U.S. already on the Internet and 53 million more to go, if your Web site isn't universally accessible when your audience is ready, it will get left behind.  </s>
<s> "If your site is painful to read, users have 15 million other places to go," says Jakob Nielson, user advocate and author of Designing Web Usability.  </s>
<s> For site architects that want to do the right thing, the World Wide Web Consortium, which lobbies for a sensibly designed, universally accessible Internet, has established a lengthy set of guidelines for a fully accessible site.  </s>
<s> "The primary issues for universal design are labeling graphics, buttons and everything with standard text," says Petersen. Navigation with a keyboard, rather than a mouse, is also critical, he adds.  </s>
<s> And if your site is Java-based, be sure to include Java-accessibility utilities so that everyone can get in.  </s>
<s> "Another primary thing is getting people with disabilities to test your site," says Petersen. "There's no substitute for that."  </s>
<s> Combs just wants the independence and the flexibility enjoyed by everyone else.  </s>
<s> "I'd like commercial sites to realize that there are many people who could and would use their services if they could navigate the pages.  </s>
<s> It would be really nice if I could do my grocery shopping here from my desk and not need to request assistance at the store, take a cab or get a neighbor or friend to come along to help."  </s>
<s> While the output of the Web for the disabled isn't perfect, it's better than in most media, and it also could be the easiest to improve.  </s>
<s> Petersen is "pretty satisfied" with his Web usage: "I can get done what I need to, but it's a lot harder than it needs to be.  </s>
<s> It's getting better.  </s>
<s> But it's still a lot easier to make a page accessible than a building."  </s>
