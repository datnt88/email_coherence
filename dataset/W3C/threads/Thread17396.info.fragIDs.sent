<s> I understand that whilst it is not recommended, it is possible to create accessible frames.  </s>
<s> We have a web based application that uses frames to split the screen up so you have a header strip across the top of the screen, a menu strip down the left hand side and then the main area of the screen is split horizontally with listings in the top half of the screen and details in the bottom half of the screen.  </s>
<s> Users select an area to work on from the menu on the left and then browse through the listing to select a particular item that is launched in the details frame.  </s>
<s> Most of the work in the application is based on jumping between the listing and details pages.  </s>
<s> We are just about to redevelop the application in a bid to make it more accessible, however want to try to avoid dropping the use of frames because they are quite integral to the functionality and loosing them will result in a lot more trips to the server and a lot more scrolling of the pages.  </s>
<s> I would be interested to hear your comments.  </s>

<s> The problem that screen reader users face is that they can't identify each frame and navigate between them efficiently if they are not coded properly.  </s>
<s> In addition to what Juan mentioned, I would also add a meaningful TITLE to the individual frame pages (make it identical to the TITLE in the frameset).  </s>
<s> This is because Jaws and Window-Eyes for example look at frames in a slightly different way.  </s>
<s> This process ensures that both users have the same experience when navigating the site.  </s>
<s> The screen reader users can pull up a list of frames and navigate to the one they want or simply browse through the frames one after the other by hitting the m key (Jaws) or Ctrl+Tab (W-E).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, they can just navigate the page linearly and every time they reach a frame the screen reader will alert them (frame "title" start) and then alert them again when they reach the end of it (frame "title" end).  </s>
<s> Ziad Gemayel Lighthouse International Accessibility Consulting and Testing Solutions (ACTS) unit ...Regarding frames, it is my understanding that all you need to do to make the frameset accessible is to use the title attribute on the frameset for each frame.  </s>
<s> But I have no idea how screen readers interpret this.  </s>

<s> Hi, Thanks for the feedback.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I should have said that one should assume that the frames were properly marked up with sensible Title attributes.  </s>
<s> Once the user has got into the main parts of the application, most of the work will consist of moving back and forth between two particular frames.  </s>
