I'm about to tag Beta 3 in CVS. 
Below are proposed release notes. 
The big issue that needs discussion is the XML Output. 
Stay or go? 
I have an updated version Document Type Declaration and an XSLT Stylesheet (thanks to Nick). 
I'm more comfortable comitting to supporting this version -- allthough it's most definitely labelled "Beta"! 
-- considering it won't likely be very interesting to most people if I get the SOAP interface in in 0.7.0. 
But my "liability" on this thing is zero so y'all W3Cers are invited to "veto" it's release if you feel it necessary. 
I'm still somewhat ambivalent about it. 
The XML output has sorta just grown happenstance instead of being "designed" as such, so while I'm reasonably comfortable with it's current state, experience suggests there are pitfalls lurking in there too. 
Unless some discussion happens, it will be released by default! 
Pre-Release Notes -- still in need of some grammar and spelling love: -- cut here 
The following changes and new features: * The error message when the configuration file is not found is now much clearer. 
* The XML Output is now much improved, and nominally at Beta status. 
* Many spelling, captialization, and grammar fixes. 
* The DOCTYPE override will now replace the orginal DOCTYPE instead of always inserting it at the beginning fo the file. 
* Sample code in output and documentation has been updated. 
* More error messages now take into account whether file upload or normal processing was done. 
* Output layout has changed to adress usability concerns. 
* Many POST requests are now redirected to a GETable URL when possible. 
* Perl version 5.6.0 is now the minimum required version. 
* The jump links in output are now context sensitive. 
* We're now excrisiatingly up fromt about SP's limitations with XML. 
* More links to external resources (thanks to Liam Quinn and the WDG). 
* We now allow the pedantically correct /referrer as well as /referer. 
:-) * Many output-escaping fixes and entity reference related fixes.

I suggest you attend some sort of anger management class.... 
That's where you learn to upset the PHBs?

All, 
We have discussed this on IRC, but for the record, I'd want at least the EARL and n3 (and of course HTTP) to stay. 
And I think it's OK to keep the XML output, even if this means we have to keep it as a beta feature in a stable product. 
I'm quite disappointed by the relative lack of feedback on these various outputs, but I think we should proceed. 
Fine.

ex-what? 
My dear friend dict -v doesn't know this either, it seems :) and s/fromt/front/ I assume. 
Very good work done with this beta so far, I'm proud of being part of this. 
Cheers, Olivier 
That's due to lack of documentation and the non-official nature of these features.
