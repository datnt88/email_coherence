Agreed. 
On both counts. 
Charles aloha, charles! 
as recorded in the minutes for today's telecon, you stated, in my response to the suggestion that the final draft of conformance reviews are passed by the manufacturer quote CMN I think the reviews are useful, but I don't want to avoid publishing in case someone doesn't like it - evaluation and criticism is a common activity everywhere except police states, but developers can often provide further information, or even make improvements. 
unquote what i meant was that the manufacturer would be pointed to the draft, asked to comment on it, and have a deadline in which to do so... any factual errors would be corrected before the draft was finalized, and any additional comments from the manufacturer would be incorporated into an appendix... that way, the manufacturer is made part of the loop, but the turning of the loop isn't dependent upon the manufacturer... still, i do like phil's idea of getting online reviewers to consider ATAG as a criterion for their reviews -- is this something we could possibly get EO to assist us with?
