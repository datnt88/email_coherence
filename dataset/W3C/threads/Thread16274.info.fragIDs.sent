Hola, I would like that the screen readers read the text for title ABBR in Spanish and the abbreviation in english. 
Which is the correct way? 
Example 1 Example 2 Thank in advance.

The same reason that has kept people from using the ABBR or ACRONYM tag is the same reason ALT was not routinely used. 
And that is page authoring tools have not incorporated this feature. 
Once ALT , Height and Width were put into page authoring tools, it became easy to use. 
So until page authoring tools allow a box for ABBR and Acronym, it will not gain wide acceptance. 
I have to disagree -- the support for HEIGHT, WIDTH, and ALT came about when browsers started supporting them, not when authoring tools started supporting them. 
People began using HEIGHT and WIDTH because it made pages "load faster" in Netscape, not because some group of tools supported them. 
ALT has been supported in most authoring tools (but not prominently) for years now. 
However, the use of ALT text as "tool tips" by major browsers has had a *much* greater effect on the acceptance of ALT than anything done by any page authoring tools.

Although that occasionally backfires -- I've had a few students complain about the tooltips treatment, and not want to include ALT text because of it (a minority view, but a frustrating one to be sure!) Ann 
I have had recent contact with the administrator of URL: Incredibly, they removed ALT tags from many places on their site for the same reason! 
I hope this is NOT a trend! 
Does anyone know the circumstances that causes IE to display TITLE versus ALT as "tool tips"? 
I think the Mac version (4.5) always displays TITLE (if both are available) but I am not sure. 
Do any of the Windows versions _ever_ pop-up TITLE content? 
Thanks, Bruce Bailey 
BB:: "Does anyone know the circumstances that causes IE to display TITLE versus ALT as "tool tips"?" 
WL: At a face2face the then MS rep, Chuck Opperman listed the order of attributes from which IE decided what to put in the tool tips. 
I don't remember the sequence but maybe TITLE came before ALT? 
This of course does not excuse removal of ALT. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
