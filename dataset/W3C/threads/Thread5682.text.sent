Hello, Since there is an owl:AllDifferent, why is there not an owl:AllDisjoint? 
It means that all class disjoint with each other. 
e.g. Thanks, wwmm wwmm@seu.edu.cn 
I've not seen any answer to this question, or maybe I missed it, but I agree that having AllDisjoint would be very useful, since partition is a frequent situation, very heavy to deal with using n^2 DisjointWith ... Bernard Vatant Senior Consultant Knowledge Engineering Mondeca - www.mondeca.com

A more useful implementation of this capability would be a property superClassOf with domain Class range List where subclasses in List are disjoint, distinct and exhaustive.

In section 5.3. 
Disjoint Classes in the Guide, you can see an explanation of the topic... 
The A common requirement is to define a class as the union of a set of mutually disjoint subclasses.

A special language construct for this is the subject of issue 5.21 drop disjointUnionOf We decided, 24 Oct 2002, to drop the special construct because... 
The only thing going for owl:disjointUnionOf is that it uses fewer triples than the alternative. 
However almost all disjoint unions are small so the number of owl:disjointWith triples will not be that large. 
[...] Unless we have new information, information that the working group didn't have at the time we made our decision, we prefer not to re-open issues. 
The points you raise in your commenst are a good ones, but they don't seem to be new. 
Please let us know if you find the explanation in the Guide and the rationale for the decision not to adopt a special construct satisfactory.
