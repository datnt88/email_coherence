<s> I've added this issue to the discussion on the RDF Thesaurus wiki page Here is a summary:- Issue 1 - Specialised vocab vs. extensible modular vocabs?  </s>
<s> Although most thesauri are pretty similar, there are important variations, and many thesauri deviate from the standards.  </s>
<s> Also, thesauri are very similar to other KOS e.g. classification schemes, taxonomis, topic maps.  </s>
<s> How do we cope with this?  </s>
<s> Option 1 - Define a specialised vocabulary that covers only thesauri that comply with the standards.  </s>
<s> Option 2 - Define a core vocab that captures what is common to all thesauri.  </s>
<s> Then define extension modules to cope with different flavours of thesauri.  </s>
<s> Option 3 - Define a core vocab that captures what is common to all KOS (thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes, topic maps etc.).  </s>
<s> Define first level extension module for thesauri.  </s>
<s> Define second level extension for flavours.  </s>
<s> === Comments on Issue 1 === AJM What we did previously ( [WWW]early draft of 8.1 http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/deliv81.htm ) was half way between (1) and (2).  </s>
<s> I would like to go for (3), but am prepared to backtrack towards (2), which may happen when we hit interop with this and OWL.  </s>
<s> (3) Would mean we have a way of fitting all these KOS together on the semantic web, which would be a good thing.  </s>
<s> Going for (3) means we have to define a core vocab.  </s>
<s> I've kind of assumed this is what we are doing (tell me if you think it's a bad idea), and issues below relate first to this core vocab.  </s>
<s> We need a name for this core vocab, so at least we can refer to it.  </s>
<s> For now, I'm going to call it the core vocab.  </s>
<s> In code, I'm using the prefix soks.  </s>
<s> Why soks?  </s>
<s> Short for SuperKOS!  </s>
<s> Got any ideas about a better name?  </s>

<s> Hi, I can't access the Wiki at the moment, and in any case don't know how you want comments, so I'll stick to email.  </s>
<s> By KOS do you mean "Knowledge Organization Scheme"?  </s>
<s> What does that cover?  </s>
<s> Are you including ontologies in there?  </s>
<s> If the answer to the last question is "yes" then I suggest avoiding 3. A common core for all different thesaurus and ontology schemes is in danger of being so generic as to be little more than raw RDF(S).  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Yup, sorry the Wiki is down again.  </s>
<s> We had some load problems (bad code in MoinMoin python; it loaded a huge log file on each pageview) which are now fixed.  </s>
<s> However the machine crashed for as yet undetermined reasons recently.  </s>
<s> Possibly because it has a miniscule amount of RAM (will have 1G soon).  </s>
<s> I had expected it to be back up by now, should be ok later today I'd guess.  </s>
<s> Am investigating.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the inconvenience... Dan  </s>
<s> Hi Alistair (just got back from holiday - wiki looks good btw) Dave asked:  </s>
<s> I'm still fuzzy on what we mean by ontologies.  </s>
<s> My understanding of ontologies for the semantic web is that one of their key utilities will be to provide a kind of umbrella 'knowledge representation' layer into which well developed, existent thesauri/other KOS's may be federated at key points.  </s>
<s> That is as well as ontologies being developed independently for classifying resources as per the requirements of specific user communities I guess.  </s>
<s> So that ontologies are very good for describing 'things' and relationships between things - which is great for describing resources on the network, &amp; the relationship of those resources to each other and also real-world "things".  </s>
<s> So, ontologies are to provide us with rigorous and consistently applied resource description for the web, in contrast to the ways that thesauri/other KOS's often use inconstent/differing notions of subsumption, for example, in representing knowledge?  </s>
<s> I'm waffling here &amp; would like to invite someone to clarify things for me!  </s>
<s> Back to Alistair's issues: As regards the options 1 2 &amp; 3 you have stated for Design Issue 1: - I think option 1 is out because it is pretty restricted in scope, given that there are many legacy &amp; evolving KOS' that will be usefully employed in the semantic web.  </s>
<s> - I understand your dilemma between option 2 &amp; 3 to be whether to keep WP8 thesauri-centric, or whether to start at a more generic place and work on from there, extending the core vocabulary specifically for thesauri &amp; also the range of other existent KOS's (also permitting the ease of integration with ontologies).  </s>
<s> I see Andy's argument about the dangers of straining to be as generic as possible.  </s>
<s> I kind of feel I need an analysis of what problems Option 2 would create w.r.t. trying to map thesauri to other KOS's &amp; ontologies using a WP8 core vocabulary.  </s>
<s> i.e. what do taxonomies, classification schemes, topic maps etc. use in their representation that we would be lacking if we stick to a core vocabulary centred on thesauri only?  </s>
<s> I'll need to do some more reading around this issue ... Regards Nikki (soks is cool with me btw)  </s>
