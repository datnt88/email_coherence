Can somebody who knows tell me whether the GEO teleconference will take place this week or not? 
Richard is on vacation, and won't participate, but I have not found any record (e.g. in the mail archives) of whether the teleconf takes place or not. 
Regards, Martin. 
Apparently no GEO teleconf this week. 
I think we haven't planned one. 
Anyway, I am ready to participate (on IRC). 
Najib.

I could do IRC too, but maybe without agenda, work on stuff from GEO plan instead?
