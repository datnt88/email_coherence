<s> Here is my interpretation of the notes Pat sent me outlining his ideas on a model theory for RDF.  </s>
<s> I've taken one or two hopefully minor liberties with the original (which I've included at the end for comparison): I've introduced the notion of a set P of properties I've introduced the notion of a set of Strings I've couched it in terms of an interpretation of n-triples As I said in the telecon - all credits to Pat, all mistakes are mine.  </s>
<s> Here goes:  </s>
<s> Let U be the set of URI References (as defined by RDF 2396).  </s>
<s> //ignore lang and namespaces for now Let S be the set of of UNICODE strings (UNICODE*)  </s>
<s> An interpretation I consists of: A set R of thingies A subset P of thingies which corresponds to Properties A mapping IN : U - R  </s>
<s> A mapping IEXT : P - R x R // R cross R  </s>
<s> A mapping IS : S - R  </s>
<s> s p o . is true in I if and only if: s, o are members of U, p is a member of P  </s>
<s> (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(I(P))  </s>
<s> s p "string" . is true in I if and only if: s is a member of U, p is a member of P and string is a member of S (IN(s), IS(string)) is a member of IEXT(I(p))  </s>
<s> Pat goes on to demonstrate a use of this base model theory to define the meaning of reification: I(rdf:subject) = { ((s,p,o), s) : s is a member of U, p is a member of P, o is a member of U union S } similarly for rdf:predicate and rdf:object.  </s>
<s> Pat points out an issue with reification, and I have another, but I suggest we get the base model theory sorted out before we get into that.  </s>
<s> And Pat's original notes: Its very simple, really.  </s>
<s> An interpretation I (of a namespace) is a set R of thingies and a mapping extI (for relational EXTension) from R to sets of pairs of thingies, and an interpretation mapping from  </s>
<s> identifiers (in the namespace) into R. (Literals are required by law to map to a certain subset of thingies in a predefined way, but otherwise are treated like any other names.)  </s>
<s> The triple  </s>
<s> s P o is true in I just when 's' 'P' and 'o' are all in the namespace and I(s),I(o) is in extI(I(P)); otherwise it is false in I. (If someone wants to insist that properties *are* their relational extension, that amounts to insisting that extI is the identity on R, which is a special case.  </s>
<s> However the set R might then not be well-founded (ie there might be membership loops among its members) which many mathematicans are uncomfortable with since its inconsistent with ZF set theory; but there are perfectly good modern set thoeries that allow it.  </s>
<s> But this is rather an arcane matter which can usefully be ignored by non-mathematicians.) For reification, we require that there are a special class of thingies corresponding to triples and names, and give special interpretations for the 'subject'and 'object' and 'predicate' properties as follows (I'll just do 'subject') I('subject')= {  [s P o] , s : s,P,o in namespace(I) } where [x y z] indicates the thingie in R that stands for the triple with subject x, property y and object z.  </s>
<s> A few issues that crop up for reification (1) do we want to say that the things in the domain *are* the triples, or are just some category of things that are 1:1 with the triples?  </s>
<s> (2) The way Ive stated it, each theory can only reify triples made from its own namespace.  </s>
<s> Is this adequate, or do we want reification to include all possible names (even those involving URIs that havnt been invented yet)?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Looks good, mostly...  </s>
<s> I don't think you mean that relative URI references are in U. I think U is the set of absolute URI references; i.e. URIs with optional #fragment thingies.  </s>
<s> that last P should be little, no? IEXT(I(p))  </s>
<s> Just 3 major things missing: 1. existentials: _:x p o is true in I iff o is a member of U, p is a member of P, and there is some thingy tx in I's set of thingies so that (tx, IN(O)) is a member of IEXT(I(p)) The substitution (tx for _:x) is said to satisfy the triple _:x p o .  </s>
<s> In general, a substitution has any number of (thingy for _:name, thingy2 for _:name2, ...) pairs.  </s>
<s> 2. conjunctions a list of triples is satisfied by some substitution if each of the triples in it is satisfied by that substitution.  </s>
<s> 3. putting it all together A list of triples is true in I iff there's some substitution that satisfies it.  </s>
<s> Yes, let's leave that for a rainy day...  </s>
<s> Just one of Pat's notes seems essential:  </s>
<s> I'd say literals map to themselves.  </s>
<s> i.e. IS is the identity function.  </s>
<s> But that depends on my position on xml:lang... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Yes  </s>
<s> There is a followup message to the original with this in - stuff I added that were not in Pat's original notes  </s>
<s> ditto  </s>
<s> Better worded than mine, but ditto  </s>
<s> Could be.  </s>
<s> Pat did talk about the integer 5 being a literal which is not the same thing as the string "5".  </s>
<s> I figured we could stay agnostic on this till we get to datatyping.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Nice work, really!  </s>
<s> ^^^RFC  </s>
<s> I guess U and S are denumerable, no?  </s>
<s> Isn't the notation f: A - B used for a function with domain A and range B?  </s>
<s> But IEXT is not a funtion at all, it is a relation on a cross product R x R which is simply a subset of R x R IEXT(I(p)) = { I(s),I(o) el R x R: I(s) I(p) I(o) is true}  </s>
<s> Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> Yup - its like my car knowing the way to work - when I hit that capital R the D and F surely follow :)  </s>
<s> Yes  </s>
<s> Yes  </s>
<s> Yes there's something screwy about what I wrote.  </s>
<s> I think I meant to write: IEXT : P - powerset(R x R) i.e. IEXT is a mapping from from P to relations on R - the idea being to ensure that R x R is not a subset of R. Is that the same as you are suggesting?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> [a correction after some holiday biking]  </s>
<s> I was wrong, IEXT is indeed a function but it's range seems to be the set of all subsets of R x R (including the empty set?)  </s>
<s> Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> Hi Brian,  </s>
<s> Exactly, although I was wrong in my wording.  </s>
<s> The range of IEXT is indeed the powerset (the set of subsets) of R x R Beside rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object being nicely modeled now, I think we can also model 'sets of triples' and rdf:li as being a property to list it's members, so something like [ rdf:li [ rdf:subject s1 ; rdf:predicate p1 ; rdf:object o1 ], [ rdf:subject s1 ; rdf:predicate p1 ; rdf:object o1 ]] but let's further think about that... Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> I agree and understand 'substitution' as being a mapping from variables to thingies and usually the identity mapping except for the given pairs.  </s>
<s> A substitution denotes bindings of the variables and instances of the thingies.  </s>
<s> A substitution is a unifier of two thingies if the instances of these thingies by the substitution are identical.  </s>
<s> All the rest is just a matter of computing those unifiers and applying some rules of inference.  </s>
<s> do you mean an (ordered) list or a set?  </s>
<s> indeed 'some' substitution is OK (not a Most General Unifier or MGU)  </s>
<s> fine  </s>
<s> Well, we had lots of rain here, but that is of course not everywhere... Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> Right, exactly.  </s>
<s> The most obvious way to do this would be to have properties denote relational extensions, ie subsets of RxR.  </s>
<s> However, there is a technical advantage to making things just a whisker more complicated and distinguishing the relation-thing from its extension (I got this idea from Chris Menzel).  </s>
<s> Then it is quite kosher to allow properties of properties, and even properties which apply to themselves, without getting caught in wierd set-theoretical loops.  </s>
<s> I'll explain more fully in a document ready soon (hopefully tomorrow.) Sorry I have been out of the rdfcore loop for a week and am trying to catch up.  </s>
<s> Yes, the subset of RxR can be empty: that is a property that has no values (ie is always false).  </s>

<s> Looks like a good start to me, modulo comments already raised.  </s>
<s> I have a couple of questions/comments:  </s>
<s> Isn't p also a member of U? (And IN(p) a member of P.)  </s>
<s> I would have exp[ectyed this to read: (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p))  </s>
<s> Similar comments.  </s>
<s> I think it would be good to see this formally linked to the syntax of N-triples, but I guess that can come later.  </s>
<s> I still have some thoughts about reification, but am happy to let that lie until the base elements are settled down.  </s>
