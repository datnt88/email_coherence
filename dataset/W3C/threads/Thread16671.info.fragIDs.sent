<s> SVG isn't that high a level graphics language, it's more like an enhanced PDF; I'm sure Adobe see it as a PDF successor.  </s>
<s> It's main concession to accessibility is that, if you strip out all the tags, you are left with the text part of the image, but that assumes that people will actually use text for text and arrange it in a sensible order, and use spaces, not positioning, for word spaces (e.g. PDF authoing guidelines say do this, but it is rare in real life PDF).  </s>
<s> There is a document that lists other supposed accessibility design features, although my impression is that accessibility is a token requirement, albeit one that has had an impact on the structure.  </s>
<s> The main current interest in SVG seems to be as a Flash replacement, but I'm afraid it may become a replacement for HTML with the page pasted up in a fairly random order.  </s>

<s> It's Adobe pushing SVG as Flash replacement.  </s>
<s> I guess it isn't just Adobe - they have the most heavily promoted SVG stuff (plugin, authoring and export in lots of products) as far as I can see, but BitFlash, the Apache project, IBM, Sun, Mozilla, Corel, Amaya, SodiPodi (another open source project), sketch (and another), and others are all producing editors and/or browsers.  </s>
