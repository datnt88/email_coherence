One of my colleagues is using tidy under cygwin: Package cygwin tidy-030201-1.tar.bz2 from mirror site: ftp://ftp.mirror.ac.uk/ 
As he needed some help, he typed tidy -h and got: tidy [option...] [file...] [option...] [file...] Utility to clean up and pretty print HTML/XHTML/XML see http://tidy.sourgeforge.net/ 
Options for HTML Tidy for Cygwin released on 1st February 2003: That's fine. 
When he copied-pasted the URL, he arrived at If you try this, you wil probably be surprised. 
I guess that the authors of this site tried to hijack the tidy page. 
Could it be possible to correct the output of tidy -v, in order to have a correct URL?

| Well, you have to know these things when you are a king, you know. 
[Terry Jones &amp; Graham Chapman] Oh, I dunno. 
Perhaps it should be considered a Feature; a Public Service effort to remind folks to go out and look at pretty girls every once in a while instead of gathering dust in front of a computer. 
:-) Hi That is the correct URI for Tidy these days (AFAIK), however you are right it is redirecting to a porn site: [chris@snowball chris]$ lynx -head -dump http://tidy.sourgeforge.net/

Hi Doh! 
My mistake I didn't notice the misspelling of sourceforge. 
Perhaps all the links should be changed to http://tidy.sf.net/ since it's easier to spell and remember!

* Chris Croome [Wed, 19/03/2003 at 10:55 +0000] I tried the other possibilities: but only got 404s but without success I suppose that the tidy-team will correct the message? 
Jany Well, that was a bit of fun. 
But, yes, Terry fixed that recently. 
(grep sourge *.c *.h) Jeepers, I hope nobody gets in trouble at work for visiting porn sites on the job when they're just trying to find the docs! 
take it easy, Charlie * Bjoern Hoehrmann [Wed, 19/03/2003 at 16:50 +0100] Bjoern, I know that. 
What I find surprising is that we have a porno site with the URL: http://tidy.sourgeforge.net and that we have this same URL given by tidy's help. 
For the other possibilities, I just wanted to check if possible other misspellings had been linked to other sites. 
It is not the case apparently.
