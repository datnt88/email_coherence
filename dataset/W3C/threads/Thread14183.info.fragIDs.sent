<s> The User Agent-based strategy is an emergency interfce designed to solve a problem which is properly addressed by the page author.  </s>
<s> Although in many cases the Frames are used in a way which makes the repair strategy adequate, the solution it provides can be particularly difficult to use (just this morning I waded through multiple framesets to get from page A to page B via a whole lot of NOFRAMES elements that said I wouldn't be able to do it, and one which was the right idea executed badly).  </s>
<s> FRAMES, by definition, are a non-serial medium.  </s>
<s> It is possible to serialise the most common use - that of a navigation bar and content frame, reasonably easily, and with a low impact on usability.  </s>
<s> For more complex framesets the difficulties encoutnered by users increase rapidly with the increased complexity.  </s>
<s> Although the title and name can be used to give some clues about the structure of the FRAMESET, the NOFRAMES element is the best (and the 'proper') way to actually provide access to the structure in a serial manner by design.  </s>

<s> The Charles' are once again in a agreement and I would add, although I'm sure that this is thought of already, that the content of the NOFRAMES tag be *replacement* information - Not just a "Get a frames capable browser" like so many pages do already.  </s>
<s> A possible repair strategy is to evaluate the content of a NOFRAMES tag and see if it mentions browser names and flag is as a possible problem.  </s>

<s> It has always been my assumption that we would say something like: - Avoid complex FRAMESET, which is defined as: more than 4 FRAMEs, but if you do, use NOFRAMES.  </s>
<s> - In all cases, provide FRAME title/name.  </s>
<s> This way, for most of frameset, with a scrollable TOC on the side, some horizontal banner on the top and a content page, the UA can built a reasonable UI, but for more complex stuff, the author has to help.  </s>
<s> I think we should advocate the use of NOFRAMES for all FRAMESETs.  </s>
<s> Although by and large the UA can solve the problem for simple sets, it is not really the best solution - the best solution is to solve it by design, and the responsibility is on the author to do that.  </s>

<s> I agree an author can achieve a better job by adding a NOFRAMES section by hand, but if a few UAs can do it in an accessible way, I still reluctant to ask millions of authors to redo their design manually, when the responsibility really lies into the hand of the language designer (the people that designed FRAME without careful thinking).  </s>
<s> There is something purely visual about FRAME: they are primarily meant to save the back-and-forth navigation between an index and a content page by keeping the index *visible* at all time.  </s>
<s> In a serial media, such as voice or line braille, you cannot really provide this functionality, and a new design is required.  </s>
<s> With the tools and languages we have today, the UA can do an accessible but not a perfect job at this new design.  </s>
<s> To consider a very simple case, if an author writes FRAMESET FRAME vertical left 20% name=index FRAME leftover name=content then the UA can easily provide a degraded interface made of links to the individual FRAME: [index] [content] whereas the NOFRAME author would probably have designed a start page with the index directly inline, thus saving a intermediary link page to the serial reader.  </s>
<s> But consider a new language construct an author can use to designate the "entry-point" page in its frameset (index in my example), an "variable-content-page", "fixed-page", etc, then suddenly, the UA can do a much better job, approaching closely what the author would do in NOFRAME, without duplication.  </s>
<s> I guess my point is that it's for WAI PF to think about, and not for GL to start asking authors about.  </s>
<s> But I'm OK with P2 for all FRAMESET if that's what people want.  </s>
<s> That's exactly what I want.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see NOFRAMES is the crucial feature of the whole frames model that allows it to be accessible, in exactly the same way that ALT and LONGDESC are crucial to IMG (although I far prefer OBJECT, and will be happy in a few years when it is actually widely implemented) But I'm OK with P2 for [NOFRAMES in] all FRAMESET if that's what people want.  </s>

<s> Would it be possible to propose a simple measure of frame complexity, E.G. a frameset is too complex if (1) it includes more than two frames, and (2) the contents of at least two of these frames do not remain constant (in other words, at least two frames are referred to in TARGET attributes somewhere in the collection of documents to which the frameset applies).  </s>
<s> NOFRAMES is priority 1 for complex frames, priority 2 otherwise.  </s>
<s> The essence of this approach is to set a determinate upper limit on frame complexity, based on our assessment of what is readily navigable and comprehensible when frames are treated as links in a serial medium such as audio.  </s>
<s> The above example of a complexity definition is just an illustration and has not been based on any research (obviously the working group would need to agree upon a definition if this solution were adopted).  </s>
