<s> Hello, Today I mentioned an idea for a kind of accessibility checklist that could be offered by the Tool to the Author.  </s>
<s> The checklist would present key topics of accessibility (identified by these guidelines) and indicate which ones the author had satisfied through some mechanism (e.g., a check mark).  </s>
<s> Those that were not yet satisfied would be unchecked.  </s>
<s> For those not yet satisfied, the Author could follow links to information about how to satisfy them.  </s>
<s> The idea here is to provide a mechanism that: 1) Isn't a spell-check-like mechanism for highlighting accessibility problems in the document body (this is also useful,  </s>
<s> but a separate mechanism).  </s>
<s> The checks could be "calculated" after the Author has finished an editing session.  </s>
<s> 2) Gives Authors an introduction to accessibility topics (a checklist of 10  </s>
<s> or so might even stick in people's minds).  </s>
<s> 3) Gives Authors a starting point to finding more info about topics 4) Gives positive feedback ("You *have* done a good job for these topics").  </s>

<s> Also a chain of links to each detected problem of that kind.  </s>
<s> The WAI summary business card we're currently finalizing has 9 items on it.  </s>
<s> I note that recent Bobby 3.0 admits that some accessibility issues require human judgement.  </s>
<s> Should we handle such subjective issues by raising them and having the author assert fulfillment?  </s>
<s> The other advantage of this approach (but again, interactive checking is also useful, if not more in the long run) is that it covers the reparation aspect for pages one hasn't author: you load pages into the tool and fix them using all the power of the computer (e.g. link chain of same problems, to handle repetive task)  </s>

<s> Yes  </s>
<s> [Various implementation details] I like the idea but I think that for inclusion in the authoring tool guidelines it should be abstracted somewhat.  </s>
<s> For instance we might recommend that authoring tools present positive reinforcement when any accessiblity issues are corrected.  </s>
<s> We may suggest that this positive reinforcement include mention of both the satisfied and unsatisfied issues.  </s>
<s> However, I think we should avoid suggesting that the checklist be activated after editing.  </s>
<s> Tool makers may find ways to present these issues within the ongoing editing process.  </s>
