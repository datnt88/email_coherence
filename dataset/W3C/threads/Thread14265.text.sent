From the guidelines: 3.7 Mark up quotations. 
Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation. 
[Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements to markup short and longer quotations, respectively. 
OK, not abusing BLOCKQUOTE makes sense. 
Using Q doesn't - the major browsers don't support it yet. 
A short quotation can be marked up as: blah blah blah "memorable quote" which doesn't meet checkpoint 3.7. 
I don't agree with your conclusion. 
There is no markup that is misused for formatting effects. 
Or: blah blah blah Q memorable quote /Q which is rendered in most browsers without any quotation marks. 
This is simply not acceptable in most cases. 
The third option is: blah blah blah Q "memorable quote" /Q which would be rendered in an HTML 4.0 compliant browser as having two sets of quotation marks. 
Also not acceptable. 
This was hotly debated in the HTML WG that produced HTML 4.0. 
The wording we came up with was the following: Visual user agents must ensure that the content of the Q element is rendered with delimiting quotation marks. 
Authors should not put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the content of a Q element. 
The idea was to be forward looking for this element. 
So, until user agents support proper rendering of Q, you shouldn't use it. 
So, my choice is between broken rendering or non-compliance For now, it's non-compliance. 
My conclusion: Don't use Q and you will be compliant. 
Is anybody working on version 1.1 of the guidelines? 
Yes we are. 
Your continued comments are welcome. 
- Ian Another similar item: Well, a bit of background first: I've been lurker for a while, but haven't posted before (I'm about to make up for it with a long post). 
I'm the webmaster for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
Our site has been accessible to text and speech based browsers since it was launched in early 1997, but has not taken advantage of the accessibility options of HTML 4.0, CSS, etc. 
That's about to change. 
Over the next few months we're going to redesign the site top-to-bottom, writing new material, etc. We've started by reworking the existing info, and later this week we'll be posting a new version of the site that meets Level A compliance, and also uses user-selectable style sheets to enhance accessibility (I borrowed the idea from Kynn's site, but wrote my own scripts before he released his). 
I had planned to meet AA compliance by the first week of August. 
The proposed accessibility requirements for federal government sites (under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act) specifies AA. 
The actual requirements will be released February 7, 2000, and compliance will be required by August 7, 2000 - I had hoped to meet that a year early. 
That's not going to happen. 
Why not?

I had hoped that by achieving AA compliance, EEOC's web site could serve as an example to other agencies that it's possible, and not terribly difficult, to provide an accessible site. 
If we can do it, with a technical staff of one (yes, it's just me), then anyone can. 
Unfortunately, we can't. 
In my personal opinion (not speaking for EEOC), the guidelines are broken. 
The result? 
For now, although I will continue to improve the accessibility of the EEOC site, AA compliance is out. 
EEOC speaking out in support of the WAI guidelines (I couldn't guarantee it, but we probably would have had a public announcement, press release, etc.) is out. 
And 13 months from now, all government agencies may be required to choose between broken rendering of their official documents or non-compliance with federal law. 
Is anybody working on version 1.1 of the guidelines? 
Adam Guasch-Melendez EEOC effects such AG:: note^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In defence of Adam's reading of the guideline, it starts with the positive injunction, _Mark up quotations_. 
In plain English, this clearly means "if the text is a quotation, mark it up with BLOCKQUOTE or Q." I agree that it is sensible to apply the "until user agents" principle here to permit the user of "" in lieu of Q /Q in this case, but it takes a language lawyer to discern this. 
In other words, I think this should be treated as a case deserving a formal interpretation (whatever the process is for those). 
Al as elements to markup browsers don't support it yet. 
A short quotation can be marked up as: simply not acceptable in most cases. 
The third option is: sets of quotation marks. 
Visual user agents must ensure that the content of the Q element is rendered with delimiting quotation marks. 
Authors should not put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the content of a Q element. 
Regarding quotations: In the English braille code (and probably others as well), the opening and closing single quotation, opening and closing double quotation and apostrophe characters are represented by distinct braille signs, as in typeset print. 
It is therefore necessary to be able to distinguish between these characters when processing a document. 
The  character entity in HTML is mapped to the double quotation mark. 
However, single quotation marks present more of a problem, especially if the apostrophe is used to represent them. 
There exist possessive forms in English in which the apostrophe appears at the end of a word. 
Likewise, there are words which appear most often in poetry ('tis, 'twas etc.), where the apostrophe occurs at the start of the word. 
Some of these cases could be readily caught by pattern matching rules, but not all are susceptible to such treatment. 
The Q element clearly overcomes this problem. 
Having an apostrophe in place of a quotation mark, on a quotation mark where an apostrophe should appear, creates ambiguities which are just as serious, if not more so, than the case in which Q and  are used together, resulting in two quotation marks on screen or in printed output. 
Is there a backward-compatible way in which to preserve the distinction between apostrophe and single quotation marks, or, given this problem and its consequences for braille production, should we leave checkpoint 3.6 as it stands? 
Does anyone have a suggestion as to how this issue can best be resolved? 
As explained in an earlier message, there are problems with Ian's suggestion to use the  character entity instead of the Q element to denote in-line quotations. 
Specifically, I have argued that correct braille presentation requires maintenance of the distinctions between double and single, opening and closing quotation marks respectively; and I am unaware of a backward-compatible means of doing so. 
Does Unicode (or ISO 8859-1 which is what most older user agents support) include distinct opening and closing single quotation marks? 
If not, I think the best solution would be to leave the requirement in checkpoint 3.7 as is. 
"...Does Unicode (or ISO 8859-1 which is what most older user agents support) include distinct opening and closing single quotation marks?" 
Unicode has the correct opening and closing quotation marks. 
So people can use them (e.g., with numerical character references). 
ISO-8859-1 doesn't have the marks used in English, but has of other languages. 
I think that the checkpoint should e splitted into "do not use BLOCKQUOTE for formatting" and "use Q for short quotations" (sorry for using neutral quots) I think that everybody agrees on the first. 
Concerning the second, Using Q is better than hardcoding the quot characters because 1. 
It is more informative (machine understandable) 2. More flexible rendering. 
May be affected by user's stylesheet. 
3. Author doesn't have to bother in matching the quots, or choosing the correct ones when nesting (less room for errors). 
People who insist on backward compatibility will probably insist on using neutral quots, as both Q and unicode character references are not supported in some browsers. 
Regards, Nir Dagan "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein I would suggest leaving the requirement as is - for those who want to avoid Q there is the argument that 11.1 allows that at the moment, but the value of having the quotation marked up rather than identified by what Jason has pointed out are ambiguous cues seems to argue against a change. 
Another approach (which is regularly used in print typography) is to apply a different styling to Q elements - this gives a visual cue which, like the use of quotation marks, has been widely used for longer than my lifetime.
