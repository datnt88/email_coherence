When using HTML Tidy with the options -asxml -latin1, it doesn't output as it should in order to produce well-formed XML. 
Without the encoding specification, an XML parser will assume UTF-8.

Use '--add-xml-decl yes' but i agree, that tidy should do this automatically (if there are iso-8859-1 characters in the file. 
If all chars are encoded as entities it isn't necessary, beacause the file is us-ascii and us-ascii is a subset of utf-8, the default encoding of XML files.) regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann ^ mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de ^ http://www.bjoernsworld.de am Badedeich 7 ?

I have modified AdjustConfig() in config.c and the misnamed FixXMLPI() in lexer.c to deal with this. 
This feature will be available in the next release, as further thought is needed on dealing with say Microsoft Windows specific encodings.
