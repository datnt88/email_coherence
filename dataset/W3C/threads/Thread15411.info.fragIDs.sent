<s> Hi, we have received from Michele Diodati (www.diodati.org)  </s>
<s> an italian expert of accessibility that has done some translations of W3C rec., the following question: "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for making Web content more accessible.  </s>
<s> They include recommendations to make pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of disabilities.  </s>
<s> In general, the guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have specific ramifications for accessibility beyond standard usability impacts."  </s>
<s> For a non-english speaking (and I think also for english ones) is not clear what means "In general, the guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have specific ramifications for accessibility beyond standard usability impacts." and must be explained in more "plain language".  </s>
<s> If the "scope" is not clear, is it not a good thing :)  </s>

<s> I agree that this may be unclear to some readers, and would suggest the following re-wording: "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one person is essential to making it even minimally 'accessible' to another."  </s>

<s> 2. all usability recommendations - whose recommendations?  </s>
<s> ... needs a reference I think.  </s>
<s> The guideline is like a standard so we need to be specific.  </s>
<s> 3. Consider changing the last part to "those aspects of usability that increase accessibility to people with disabilities".  </s>
<s> 4. The Introduction to WCAG 1.0 listed the categories likely to be benefited very eloquently.... not just PWD.  </s>
<s> Can this also be incorporated here?  </s>
