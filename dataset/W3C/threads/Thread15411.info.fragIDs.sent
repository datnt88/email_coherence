To address Roberto's comment, does anyone disagree with replacing the scope of WCAG 2.0 [1] with: "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
They include recommendations to make pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of disabilities. 
In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one person makes it 'accessible' to another. 
The guidelines do not attempt to address all usability recommendations, but instead focus on those aspects of usability that increase accessibility." --wendy [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#scope

4. Scope: item #1 under scope now reads: "Advance WCAG 2.0 further towards a W3C Recommendation, per requirements ...." 
Hi, we have received from Michele Diodati (www.diodati.org) 
an italian expert of accessibility that has done some translations of W3C rec., the following question: "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
They include recommendations to make pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of disabilities. 
In general, the guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have specific ramifications for accessibility beyond standard usability impacts." 
For a non-english speaking (and I think also for english ones) is not clear what means "In general, the guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have specific ramifications for accessibility beyond standard usability impacts." and must be explained in more "plain language". 
If the "scope" is not clear, is it not a good thing :)

OK with me.

Wendy and The Group - Basically, I like what Roberto offers-up as a change to the "Scope" as presently written. 
The sentence, "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one person makes it 'accessible' to another." 
seems a bit awkward but I cannot figure out a better written solution - what about saying - In most cases (as opposed to - in some cases) a bit more pro-active (but what do I know). 
And, I wish I could word-smith a better word for the "something" in the same sentence. 
The flavor of what's being said, is GREAT! 
Thanks Roberto! 
And, I can live 
with it the way Roberto has written it, too.

Doyle flags the following sentence as somewhat problematic: "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one person makes it 'accessible' to another." 
I agree that this may be unclear to some readers, and would suggest the following re-wording: "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one person is essential to making it even minimally 'accessible' to another."

I find this more agreeable. 
Some thoughts: 1. 
It might help to explain that usability is a broader concept ...of which accessibility is a part. 
2. all usability recommendations - whose recommendations? 
... needs a reference I think. 
The guideline is like a standard so we need to be specific. 
3. Consider changing the last part to "those aspects of usability that increase accessibility to people with disabilities". 
4. The Introduction to WCAG 1.0 listed the categories likely to be benefited very eloquently.... not just PWD. 
Can this also be incorporated here?
