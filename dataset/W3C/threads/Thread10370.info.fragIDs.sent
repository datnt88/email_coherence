I noticed when validating the parseType="Collection" example from the Primer that the W3C RDF Validator still generates rdf:type rdf:List triples for the blank nodes, which I believe we decided was no longer supposed to happen in resolving issue tbl-03. 
This should probably be fixed at some point. 
Either that or people will complain that the graph in the Primer (which I changed to take all that stuff out) doesn't match the graph generated by the Validator.

I recall the decision was "doesn't have to generate" not "should not generate". 
So technically, the validator is conformant. 
Though someone may still wish to change it to omit the triples in question.

There is no fuzziness at all in what triples are generated from RDF/XML - that is one of the things we were revising for. 
parseType="Collection" must not generate them after our change. 
Applications that don't want to be conformant can do what they like, as always.

I suspect Emmanuel just needs to slot in the latest Jena release ... (I understand the validator is now using the version 2 stream which is up to date on all WG decisions) Jeremy

Done. 
The RDF Validator now uses Jena 2beta1.
