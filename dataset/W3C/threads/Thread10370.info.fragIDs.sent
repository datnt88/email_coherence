<s> I noticed when validating the parseType="Collection" example from the Primer that the W3C RDF Validator still generates rdf:type rdf:List triples for the blank nodes, which I believe we decided was no longer supposed to happen in resolving issue tbl-03.  </s>
<s> This should probably be fixed at some point.  </s>
<s> Either that or people will complain that the graph in the Primer (which I changed to take all that stuff out) doesn't match the graph generated by the Validator.  </s>

<s> So technically, the validator is conformant.  </s>
<s> Though someone may still wish to change it to omit the triples in question.  </s>

<s> There is no fuzziness at all in what triples are generated from RDF/XML - that is one of the things we were revising for.  </s>
<s> parseType="Collection" must not generate them after our change.  </s>
<s> Applications that don't want to be conformant can do what they like, as always.  </s>
