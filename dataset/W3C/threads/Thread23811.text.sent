And there will be another major annc very soon now, from a Conspicuously Absent Player... Adobe, Netscape, Apple at work on HTML font standard By Dana Gardner InfoWorld Electric Posted at 6:49 PM PT, Feb 26, 1996 Adobe Systems Inc., Apple Computer Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. are working to define an HTML font standard to deliver a wider variety of fonts for ready use by World Wide Web sites, the companies announced Monday. 
The three companies expect to provide a cross-platform solution for using Type 1 and TrueType fonts in HTML and PDF documents. 
The result: a richer visual appeal for Internet-based information. 
Specifically, the companies plan to present: * Anti-aliased type for higher screen quality for both large and small type sizes. 
* Embedded, compressed fonts for fast performance over 14.4Kbps modem connections and for font fidelity. 
* Progressively rendered fonts that enable the screen to display text immediately. 
* Font subsetting that improves performance because only the characters needed will be downloaded. 
The fonts exploit technology under development as part of Adobe's Acrobat "Amber" Plug-in for Netscape Navigator. 
The new font technology will be supported in the next version of "Amber" and later this year in Netscape Navigator client software. 
Apple bundles Adobe Acrobat and Netscape Navigator with the Apple Internet Connection Kit and the Apple Internet Server Solution.
