<s> The current version of the guidelines include the following: 5.3 Direct Navigation 1.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to use the keyboard to move the focus directly to links and controls on a page.  </s>
<s> Users should be able to search for (and shift the focus to) a link or control by its position or by its name Kitch: I am not sure what you mean by "should be able to search for a link or control by its position?"  </s>
<s> Does this mean position in a list of elements?  </s>
<s> Also, while the ability to search for and move the focus to an element or control is important and should be included, I don't know if it is the best, or only, way to provide direct access to elements.  </s>
<s> This issue may not be as critical if manufacturers provide "alternative views" of pages.  </s>
<s> Please correct me if I am wrong but, could this be one possible scenario of how someone who uses a screen reader would use the search feature - He or she might - 1) listen to a web page 2) may or may not be able easily identify the text in a link, depending upon how the link is rendered and how the screen reader is configured 3) issue a "find" command for a word in the desired link 4) repeat the "find" command since the chosen word may or may not be unique to that link.  </s>
<s> this may mean that the user also has to issue "read line" commands to identify all of the text in a link prior to making his or her selection 5) and finally, activate the desired link.  </s>

<s> In other words, can some of the features of lynx be built into other browsers?  </s>
