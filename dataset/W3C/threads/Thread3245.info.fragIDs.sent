<s> Why don't we mirror the content of this page on the W3C website QA section?  </s>

<s> We ought to reply to this... Of course, I don't think it makes any sense  </s>
<s> to mirror that on the W3C site (for obvious maintenance reason, + possible political issues).  </s>
<s> But what about announcing it from the QA home page?  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> This is likely the best solution currently.  </s>
<s> There have been some other ideas floating around about how best to aggregate (and to maintain) this resource.  </s>
<s> It's probably getting to the size and scope where those ideas should be explored more thoroughly.  </s>
<s> For example, if it's feasible and I can figure out how to do it in MT, perhaps a unique RSS feed would be useful for that entry, instead of or in addition to my having to post a new entry to VOT and post a notice to the list.  </s>
<s> This does nothing to deal with the management, integrity and organization of the entries themselves, of course.  </s>
<s> And it is currently location specific.  </s>
<s> I can scratch my head about that too.  </s>
<s> But suggestions  </s>
<s> and comments would be a help.  </s>
<s> Thanks. ...edN  </s>
<s> suggestions  </s>
<s> I was thinking about some sort of link portal or link management scripting, server side.  </s>
<s> I was working with an xml, perl project I found online, but there were a few items that were not that smooth.  </s>
<s> I did also have the categories by language, but my list is blogs and news.  </s>
<s> So the list is a bit bigger with a section that has reference to some key standards, guidelines, and accessibility websites.[not  </s>
<s> all blogs].  </s>
<s> Next, I sorted each subcategory, alphabetically by blog name/site name or title.  </s>
<s> Included author or authors where found, and short description.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to have as a database project, content management set-up, where updates and changes could be made on-the-fly.  </s>
<s> Another option might be some table set-up, with sql, and sort order options on the headers.  </s>
<s> If done accessibly and via standards/guidelines, this could work well.  </s>
<s> Maybe a separate table for each language group.  </s>
<s> XML still looks like a possibility, and I have been scouting some XSL , stylesheets , transformations, etc ... though I am new to this area, but I see sort and group as possibilities through XML.  </s>
<s> Right now mine sits in xhtml flat files as a static web page...  </s>
<s> Not even in a blog.  </s>
