I've just completed an update to my 25 April 2003 post, "Web standards 
and accessibility weblogs, 
etc.":http://www.lynnparkplace.org/vot/archives/accessibility/000015.html 
New in this version are entries pointing to single items (rather than 
sites) -- reports, articles, findings -- relevant to standards and 
accessibility. 
I *think* I've cleared up all the commitments I made to people who had comments or e-mail suggestions. 
I apologize for the length of time it has taken to get caught up. 
As always, if there are problems or inaccuracies or other references, please send them along. 
Regards.

Great job Ed, I have my project together now, and it is sorted just a bit differently. 
I tried to get the names of the authors or group of authors for each site. 
[anyone can correct me or change items if they find a need.

Great! Good work, Ed. 
Why don't we mirror the content of this page on the W3C website QA section?

We ought to reply to this... Of course, I don't think it makes any sense 
to mirror that on the W3C site (for obvious maintenance reason, + possible political issues). 
But what about announcing it from the QA home page?

Thanks. 
This is likely the best solution currently. 
There have been some other ideas floating around about how best to aggregate (and to maintain) this resource. 
It's probably getting to the size and scope where those ideas should be explored more thoroughly. 
For example, if it's feasible and I can figure out how to do it in MT, perhaps a unique RSS feed would be useful for that entry, instead of or in addition to my having to post a new entry to VOT and post a notice to the list. 
This does nothing to deal with the management, integrity and organization of the entries themselves, of course. 
And it is currently location specific. 
I can scratch my head about that too. 
But suggestions 
and comments would be a help. 
Thanks. ...edN 
suggestions 
I was thinking about some sort of link portal or link management scripting, server side. 
I was working with an xml, perl project I found online, but there were a few items that were not that smooth. 
I did also have the categories by language, but my list is blogs and news. 
So the list is a bit bigger with a section that has reference to some key standards, guidelines, and accessibility websites.[not 
all blogs]. 
Next, I sorted each subcategory, alphabetically by blog name/site name or title. 
Included author or authors where found, and short description. 
It would be nice to have as a database project, content management set-up, where updates and changes could be made on-the-fly. 
Another option might be some table set-up, with sql, and sort order options on the headers. 
If done accessibly and via standards/guidelines, this could work well. 
Maybe a separate table for each language group. 
XML still looks like a possibility, and I have been scouting some XSL , stylesheets , transformations, etc ... though I am new to this area, but I see sort and group as possibilities through XML. 
Right now mine sits in xhtml flat files as a static web page... 
Not even in a blog.
