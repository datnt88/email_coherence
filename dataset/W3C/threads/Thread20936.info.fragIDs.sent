Hi folks. 
Amaya 8.4 installation was Ok. 
But when trying to run the program: it draws the Amaya screen, starts with the home page but fails loading the image (no message, just pretending me to wait forever). 
The whole system is hang up. 
Cheers.

Yes, I had the same problem in Windows 95 both with 8.3 and 8.4. 
The computer hangs with the CPU running at 100%. 
In the W95 box I instaqlled both the NT and W98 versions of 8.3. 
Instead, in my W2K box it runs like a charm.

We added some compiling flags because events are managed differently on W98 and NT/XP/2000. 
So it's normal that the WinXP version doesn't work on W98. 
But we detected no special difference concerning image management. 
Image libraries are included in the Amaya package and it works on our Win98 platform. 
Do you have VisualStudio available to trap the problem? 
Did a previous Amaya version work on this box?

I happily ran Amaya for W2K or NT in my W95 notebook for years, it worked fine. 
So I downloades only one version. 
It's as of 8.3 that this problen started to show. 
Yes I have VS, only I don't have C++ installed, I don't know how to use it. 
I'm sorry I can't help as I'd like to. 
Yes, many. 
Maybe it's a problem with the Spanish version of Windows I use, and "JuanMiguel Signes" sounds like a Spanish name maybe close to my neighborhood. 
Besides our's I don't see any more complains about this. 
I run the English version of Amaya, no translation. 
I have yes the Spanish dictionary installed for spell checking but I don't use it. 
I'll try to uninstall Amaya completely and reinstall 8.4 to see what happens (are there any registry keys I should delete to be completely clean?).

I don't have development tools in that computer but the following may help your debugging: - I've been using some previous versions of Amaya on that computer. 
- I had the same problem after installing Amaya 8.4 W98 on a different directory to prevent bugs related to the spanish version. 
- I reinstalled Amaya 8.3 and it works fine. 
- I didn't mistook amaya-WinXP-8.4.exe for amaya-Win98-8.4.exe. 
By the way, their sizes only differ in 211K, much less than what it is announced on the amaya download page. 
Saludos cordiales.

It works now. 
I reinstalled 8.4 for W98 and it works like a charm. 
Straight over the previous 8.4 installation (which was installed over 8.4 for W2K installed over 8.3 installed over ...).
