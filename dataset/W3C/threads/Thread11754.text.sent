Hello translators, I'm sorry that I have to write so many letters to you, but that is needed to ensure a translation's quality. 
Two questions about 'W3C in 7 points'. 
If you can help please write to thecroll@mail.ru, not to the list. 
1. Flexibility is the necessary companion of distributed systems, and the life and breath of the Internet, not just the Web. 
Sounds a bit strange. 
Can you suggest any exact translations/rephrasing please? 
2. 'Cooler multimedia'. 
Can anyone paraphrase please? 
We don't have the word 'cool' or 'cooler' in Russian. 
I saw a lot of translations of WAI QuickTips. 
As far as I know they are not listed on W3C TR page, so will you give me a permission to translate the tips? 
Thanks, Alex. 
Well, others may have problems with these points, too. 
What words exactly do you have problems with? 
'more impressive'? 
Regards, Martin. 
Hi, I'm Omoti. 
On Fri, 7 Sep 2001 15:27:18 +0400 Here is my version... "The Web needs Flexibility. 
And the life and breath of the Internet also needs flexibility. 
And distributed systems needs flexibility too. 
So make all of them flexible ! 
" Hope this helps... Omoti omoti@n24.net
