I have tried using the user_name:password feature to access my internet mail accounts like email.com or hotmail.com but it does not work. 
I only have an e-mail account. 
Please help. 
Dear Ravi, The right technique is this 1. Request for the www.hotmail.com 
homepage (without specifying anything) 2. Fill the necessary login data on the right sections of the requested page. 
NOTES The user_name:password feature is only for HTTP validation. 
It would not work on the web e-mail sites. 
Try the wm.ictp.trieste.it 
server using the above steps and please let me know how it goes. 
Thanks Clement Onime 
Dear Clement, I followed the technique that you asked me to. 
But I did not get any reply from the ictp.trieste.it 
server. 
Please tell me whether there's any other way. 
thanks. 
ravi.
