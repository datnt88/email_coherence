<s> That's fine in the sense of "this will help you build popup links that don't break if JavaScript is off".  </s>
<s> It's not fine in the sense of "if I don't want new windows to popup, you are forcing me to disable my JavaScript to prevent it" or "my UA blocks popups, so by assuming I have popups the site is broken for me" or the like.  </s>

<s> From the ICDRI Press Release at: National Council on Disability (NCD) says that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to both commercial and other private web sites.  </s>
<s> Today NCD released their report which is a careful and precise analysis of the legal issues pointing out the arguments for both sides.  </s>
<s> But based on all authorities, including those opposed to the view that the ADA should apply to e-commerce, the report concludes that the intent of the ADA was to cover entities under ADA Title III.  </s>
<s> Among the authorities cited are the works of Cynthia Waddell, ICDRI's Executive Director, as well as resources such as the Access Primer Page by ICDRI; the book, Constructing Accessible Web Sites, co-authored by three ICDRI Board Members; and the educational portal and web accessibility validator, Cynthia SaysTM.  </s>

<s> I'd expect this not to work in any scripting enabled browser which has popups disabled as the return false is not conditional on the popup succeeding.  </s>
<s> I believe that return false for this purpose wasn't in the original NS JavaScript, although it is probably fairly universal these days.  </s>
<s> This may fail on a pure W3C DOM1 implementation, as most of the parameters are undefined.  </s>
<s> One of the problems with such popups under IE is that shellexecute will use any available browser window, including ones with critical controls disabled.  </s>
<s> Please don't remove ordinary functions from the window (scrollbars, location, etc).  </s>
<s> It's nice that it is resizeable, but you have no idea what my text size is to start with, and if there is more than a screenful and no scrollbars after you already made me adjust everything I will be extremely frustrated in trying to use your content.  </s>
<s> If browsers gave me decent control (permitted me to put back the bits that you had turned off) things would be more reasonable.  </s>
<s> There is value in setting window default presentation (an example is what important) if the user can override it reasonably.  </s>
