Is this to say that the "Perfect Pop-up," as reflected in the "Pop-up Window Generator," is problematic?

and I've used it to present several "pages" at: Bill Williams I know that it's not good practice to open new windows but I think that there are instances where it is valuable from a usability point of view. 
Currently I am working on a help system for an intranet and want the help page(s) to open in a new window (with the necessary prior warning to users of course) so that users can work through the help page whilst still looking at the site. 
My questions is, since the use of target is deprecated, how is it possible to open a new window without the use of javascript? 
I don't really want to use client-side scripting if at all possible but can't see any way round this problem. 
thanks Julian 
That's fine in the sense of "this will help you build popup links that don't break if JavaScript is off". 
It's not fine in the sense of "if I don't want new windows to popup, you are forcing me to disable my JavaScript to prevent it" or "my UA blocks popups, so by assuming I have popups the site is broken for me" or the like.

From the ICDRI Press Release at: National Council on Disability (NCD) says that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to both commercial and other private web sites. 
Today NCD released their report which is a careful and precise analysis of the legal issues pointing out the arguments for both sides. 
But based on all authorities, including those opposed to the view that the ADA should apply to e-commerce, the report concludes that the intent of the ADA was to cover entities under ADA Title III. 
Among the authorities cited are the works of Cynthia Waddell, ICDRI's Executive Director, as well as resources such as the Access Primer Page by ICDRI; the book, Constructing Accessible Web Sites, co-authored by three ICDRI Board Members; and the educational portal and web accessibility validator, Cynthia SaysTM. 
The report is posted online at NCD is an independent federal agency making recommendations to the President and Congress on disability policy. 
NCD First proposed and then drafted the original Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Cynthia Waddell, ICDRI's Executive Director, is the author of the first accessible web design standard for government in the US and is a former Americans with Disabilities Act compliance officer.

"Forget everything you know about creating pop-up windows. 
Most importantly, forget you ever knew that the javascript pseudo-protocol ever existed. 
Do you hear me??" Looks like a good method to me. 
Pop-ups when supported, same window when not. 
The rest is down to the conscience of the developer not to abuse.

I'd expect this not to work in any scripting enabled browser which has popups disabled as the return false is not conditional on the popup succeeding. 
I believe that return false for this purpose wasn't in the original NS JavaScript, although it is probably fairly universal these days. 
This may fail on a pure W3C DOM1 implementation, as most of the parameters are undefined. 
One of the problems with such popups under IE is that shellexecute will use any available browser window, including ones with critical controls disabled. 
Please don't remove ordinary functions from the window (scrollbars, location, etc). 
It's nice that it is resizeable, but you have no idea what my text size is to start with, and if there is more than a screenful and no scrollbars after you already made me adjust everything I will be extremely frustrated in trying to use your content. 
If browsers gave me decent control (permitted me to put back the bits that you had turned off) things would be more reasonable. 
There is value in setting window default presentation (an example is what important) if the user can override it reasonably. 
But at the moment that isn't really true.
