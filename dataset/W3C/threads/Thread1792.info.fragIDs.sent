<s> Since I was not able to convince the ACL working group to marshall this kind of information as an OPTIONS request, we should probably consider changing the versioning protocol to also marshall this kind of information (i.e. DAV:workspace-collection-set, DAV:activity-collection-set, and DAV:version-history-collection-set) as live properties, and not as OPTIONS requests.  </s>
<s> So I'd like to poll the mailing list (especially DeltaV client and/or server implementors: Do you prefer to: (a) leave xxx-collection-set as it is (marshalled only as OPTIONS) (b) support marshalling both as OPTIONS and as live properties (c) marshal only as live properties and deprecate the OPTIONS marshalling I vote for (c), as it simplifies the spec, and makes it consistent with the ACL protocol.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Same for me (c).  </s>
<s> The big picture here is that we're making OPTIONS less useful.  </s>
<s> In particular, we're saying that OPTIONS * is too hard for servers to implement correctly with a bunch of extra headers and body information, because * is too ambiguous.  </s>
<s> That's probably fair enough; it's a result of the early decision that not all resources on a HTTP server need be WebDAV-capable resources.  </s>
<s> Should we go so far as to say that clients SHOULD NOT use OPTIONS *?  </s>
<s> My concern with going in this direction is that a client accessing a WebDAV server may be configured initially with only the server's domain name.  </s>
<s> How does the client start figuring out what is where on the  </s>
<s> server?  </s>
<s> Does "OPTIONS /" + "PROPFIND /" (or the same requests to whatever path is given) solve this problem for the client instead?  </s>
<s> If the client does OPTIONS only on particular resources, how *does* the server show capabilities?  </s>
<s> E.g. support for MKCOL can *never* show up as an allowed method on any existing resource.  </s>
<s> My take is that MKCOL shows up in OPTIONS * and not in any other OPTIONS request.  </s>
<s> Thus OPTIONS * serves an important role.  </s>
<s> Does the client need some way to ask the server "do you support WebDAV anywhere on the server, and if so, where?"  </s>
<s> This would be similar to the question of asking a server "do you support HTTP on some port, and if so, which"...  </s>
<s> BTW, I'm curious what you mean by "changing the version protocol".  </s>
<s> RFC 3253 can't be changed now.  </s>
<s> Are you proposing a new internet-draft to  </s>
<s> eventually obsolete 3253?  </s>
<s> Servers compliant with 3253 will continue to  </s>
<s> be so even if the WG decides to replace OPTIONS marshalling with property marshalling.  </s>
<s> I'm sure I'm stating the obvious, but I'm surprised to see talk of changing DeltaV so recently after the RFC was issued, particularly "for consistency" with documents that aren't yet RFCs.  </s>

<s> I think the main issue is that this is a usage of OPTIONS that doesn't seem to be in line with HTTP 1.1, which says: "If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource.  </s>
<s> Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server.  </s>
<s> For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof)."  </s>
<s> Consequently, the servlet API doesn't offer my any simple mechanism to influence the result of "OPTIONS *" (or am I missing something).  </s>
<s> So the feature is under discussion because it's extremely hard if not impossible to implement, and thus will be questioned once when RFC3253 takes the next RFC standardization step.  </s>
<s> I think that's a configuration a bug.  </s>
<s> If only part of the URL namespace on a server talks WebDAV, you'll need the URL prefix of this namespace partition.  </s>
<s> There's no way to avoid that right now.  </s>
<s> No.  </s>
<s> ...would serve an important role, if it could be implemented.  </s>
<s> If you think that discovery of MKCOL using "OPTIONS *" is an important feature, we should find out whether there are interoperable implementations supporting that.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.1 clearly states that if you do OPTIONS * and look at the allowed methods, you CAN NOT take the absence of MKCOL (in Allow:) as sign that no part of the URL namespace supports this method.  </s>
<s> If your client assumes that, it's buggy.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure why a client would need that.  </s>
<s> If the WebDAV-enabled namespace doesn't start at "/", the client will have to be configured to know the complete prefix.  </s>
<s> To change this, the process implementing the root resource will need to have knowledge of all other descendants in it's namespace, and a *new* protocol is needed to marshall this information.  </s>
<s> The RFC can't be changed, but the protocol can (in the future).  </s>
<s> My take is that with RFC3253, we should try to get the next revision (proposed - draft) out as soon as we have multiple interoperable implementations.  </s>
<s> So it absolutely makes sense to discuss these issues right now rather than waiting too long (as it happened with RFC2518).  </s>
<s> But then, what's the point in delaying this work?  </s>
<s> The sooner an issue is discussed, the earlier we can add it to the errata document (preferrably with a resolution of the issue).  </s>
<s> We all benefit from that: the WG, because things get resolved when they are raised (instead of years later), and implementors (because they can use *both* RFC3253 and a draft of a deltaV revision) to implement their servers.  </s>
