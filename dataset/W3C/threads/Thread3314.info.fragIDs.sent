<s> Dear All, we are currently doing some preliminary research into ways in which we can market SWAD Europe.  </s>
<s> We are considering having some sort of SWAD-E gadget or toy to give out to people and although we have a few ideas in mind we would welcome any suggestions from yourselves.  </s>
<s> You may have attended a conference or workshop where you were given or saw a piece of promotional material that interested you, if so I'd like to know.  </s>
<s> Please email this list if you have any ideas or suggestions.  </s>
<s> Thank you Caroline Caroline V Meek Personnel and Admin Coordinator Institute for Learning and Research Technology University of Bristol 8-10 Berkeley Square Bristol BS8 1HH Caroline.Meek@bristol.ac.uk www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk  </s>
<s> I rather like these:  </s>
<s> and I've got one of those light-up hi-bounce balls - some company had them at xml europe 2001 (but mine's from Hawaii sea-world) I also got a rather nice neuweb blue curcular enamel badge from IST2002 Libby  </s>
<s> Yo-yos - they have a node and an arc built in.  </s>
<s> (I would say plastic bows and arrows, but that would be puerile).  </s>
<s> A thousand flowers.  </s>
<s> When was the last time you got a decent flower at a techno-geek thing?  </s>
<s> (not plastic ones; real ones.  </s>
<s> You need to explain what it is about, but they are memorable) chaals  </s>
<s> Before I read this, I was thinking of something that could also illustrate the utility of RDF.  </s>
<s> I think this tangle toy probably has a number of topological states that: (a) could be identified using URIs (b) their relationships could be described using RDF, e.g. in terms of loop-twists or some suchlike maneouvre (c) sequences of operations to change from one state to another might be derived using a standard RDF tool like cwm or Euler.  </s>
<s> Do we have a mathematician of sufficient skill to work out the details?  </s>
<s> Another thought I had along similar lines was one of those tile puzzles, where you "move the hole around" to obtain some well-ordered arrangement of tiles.  </s>
<s> (e.g. the RDF-logo?) Again, linked to RDF descriptions of the states and solvable using standard off-the-shelf (or off-the-web) RDF tools.  </s>

<s> They do look fun.  </s>
<s> A very good idea.  </s>
<s> Just prior to Rubik cubes hitting the big time I got one through a small ad somewhere (back of New Scientist?),  </s>
<s> along with an explanatory booklet.  </s>
<s> The booklet was more like an academic paper, delving pretty deeply into group theory.  </s>
<s> I struggled through the booklet, learning stuff I'd have dismissed as just too difficult/dull if it hadn't been for the wonderful cube.  </s>
<s> Anyone done RDF for finite state machines??  </s>
<s> I did see a lovely toy the other day, actually nodes &amp; arcs.  </s>
<s> The arcs were bar magnets covered in coloured plastic, the nodes ball bearings.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately they were about ?10 for half a dozen of each.  </s>
<s> The only thing I can think of to suggest is e-SW angle grinders.  </s>
<s> (Coincidentally, there some work I need to do on some concrete ledges in our cellar).  </s>
<s> Cementic Web, anyone?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>
