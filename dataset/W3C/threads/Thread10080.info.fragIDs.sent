<s> I've seen nothing proposed that I could decide on.  </s>
<s> If anyone from the WG wants to promote it, please can you outline it on this list in advance.  </s>
<s> Take care to get the syntax right :) Dave  </s>
<s> To clarify, I am proposing that would result in the triple #foo some:property XML" h1 Blargh /h1 "@en .  </s>
<s> Where the interpretation of such XML literals would be akin  </s>
<s> to that of M&amp;S along with the new considerations of canonicalization,  </s>
<s> and such.  </s>
<s> Thus parseType="Literal" would not result in a typed literal of any kind, and the datatype rdfs:XMLLiteral would be removed  </s>
<s> from all RDF specs.  </s>
<s> As a second part of this proposal, lang tags would simply be ignored for typed literals and removed from the graph syntax for typed literals entirely.  </s>
<s> Thus would result in the triple  </s>
<s> #foo some:property "10"^^xsd:int .  </s>
<s> and not #foo some:property "10"@en^^xsd:int .  </s>
<s> I guess these really constitute two proposals, but the first enables  </s>
<s> the second, and both address last call comments.  </s>

<s> This is reversing a previous decision on XML literals being made into typed literals with the rdf:XMLLiteral URI as the datatype URI.  </s>
<s> Please can you explain the new information that was brought up and the reason for this particular solution.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't cite M&amp;S as particularly specific on this point.  </s>
<s> We discussed this many times before and parseType="Literal" was too vague in M&amp;S.  </s>
<s> OK, I'm clear on what you want to do.  </s>
<s> I want to know why.  </s>
<s> Yes and on this second proposal, please explain what new information means this change is required.  </s>
<s> Which specific last call comments (URIs please) does it/they address?  </s>
<s> Both of these will cause significant implementation rewritings/reversions - and I *do* know this since I recall changing it last time.  </s>
<s> Plus there is also having to update/revert and check several test cases and WD text changes.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> The "new information" here is that someone outside our group took a look at the design resulting from the previous decision and said that it was a mess.  </s>
<s> That is not of itself compelling, but I think it's significant because I think that within the group we've got to a stage that we feel unable to challenge hard-won consensus.  </s>
<s> I think that it's significant that someone outside the group felt strongly enough to raise an issue that seems to have some resonance within the group.  </s>
<s> None of these are sufficient reasons to make the changes suggested, but I think they are sufficient to suggest reconsideration.  </s>

<s> "Patrick.Stickler" said:  </s>
<s> I fully appreciate that fact.  </s>
<s> Simple.  </s>
<s> As Peter points out, and I agree, having a single "special" datatype that does not work the same as all other datatypes is a problem.  </s>
<s> Well, we certainly would be following the intent of the charter if we clarified things accordingly.  </s>
<s> I think the WG would have a very strong and fast concensus of how non-datatype XML literals would be defined and the editorial effort would not be prohibitive.  </s>
<s> So that *all* rdfs:Datatype's would have identical treatment.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> But I think this falls within the scope of "doing it right this time around".  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> "Patrick.Stickler" said:  </s>
<s> We should look up the reason we made this change last time - why was rdf:XMLLiteral invented.  </s>
<s> It might be it still remains the least worst option of several.  </s>
<s> Is there any *critical* reason why this special case is a problem or is this just a consistency "yuck" argument?  </s>
<s> If the latter there are several choices to make all literals act the same.  </s>
<s> Throwing out xml:lang everywhere, adding it everywhere.  </s>
<s> Adding a datatype to all literals such as rdf:PlainLiteral.  </s>
<s> Sorry, the editorial effort is not minimal - we still haven't worked any of the details of the rdf-wrapper thing, and I don't like it so far.  </s>
<s> So I'm checking for good reasons why, and consistency while nice, isn't one.  </s>
<s> The implementation effort is also greater.  </s>
<s> ok, it is consistency.  </s>
<s> I rate that as not sufficient alone.  </s>
<s> Dave said:  </s>
<s> In that case, what is wrong (broken, critical) that we are now meant to be doing right?  </s>
<s> On proposal #2, what is wrong with lang tags on XML literals, that you cannot live with or breaks something?  </s>
