<s> Hello Katie and Loretta, Thanks for working on this! Sorry I haven't commented in more detail sooner.  </s>
<s> Here are my comments on the PDF Techniques for WCAG found at 1.  </s>
<s> I think we should include version numbers in the title: PDF Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 and 2.0 2. In the abstract it says, "Because PDF is a Page Description Language, not intended to be edited directly, these techniques are intended particularly for the developers of authoring tools that generate PDF as an output format."  </s>
<s> Since that is the case, perhaps most of these should be incorporated into the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Techniques [1].  </s>
<s> Particularly, in relation to techniques for Content Management Tools which ATAG-TECHS defines as, "Tools that assist authors to create and organize specific types of Web content without the author having control over the markup or programming implementation."  </s>
<s> However, I think that if you explain how authors can use the tools to get these results, that will be very appropriate for WCAG.  </s>
<s> Does that exist somewhere already that we can point into?  </s>
<s> For example, does Adobe have a document that describes how to use Adobe tools to create accessible PDF documents?  </s>
<s> If so, is it on the Web?  </s>
<s> If it is, then we can list WCAG 1.0/2.0 checkpoints and point into the appropriate places in the Adobe materials.  </s>
<s> For example, I found section 7 "Foreground and Background colors" really helpful.  </s>
<s> Are there more tips like this?  </s>
<s> Also, under Guideline 2, section 1.1 (Render characters and words in reading order).  </s>
<s> Is there a way to say, "here is how to create characters and words so that they are rendered in reading order"?  </s>
<s> 3. I don't understand how the sections are numbered - is that part of what you wanted us to ignore?  </s>
<s> 4. Are the "Deprecated Technique Examples" under Guideline 2 section 1.1 bad examples?  </s>
<s> That wasn't clear.  </s>
<s> 5. Section 3.2 (Tag artifacts in the page contents) - I'm not sure how that relates to checkpoint 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 since it is mostly about pagination and layout.  </s>
<s> Can you associate row and column headers with data cells in PDF? or Linearize layout tables?  </s>
<s> 6. Section 6 (Document navigation) - needs work.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem complete.  </s>
<s> 7. Section 1.5, I think the most appropriate WCAG 1.0 checkpoints are 13.2 (Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]).  </s>
<s> For example, to specify the character set in HTML you would use: also: 3.2 Create documents that validate to published formal grammars.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] and perhaps also 4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] But, I'm not completely sure what 1.5 means.  </s>
<s> Is it saying, "use unicode characters?"  </s>
<s> I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of unicode, so perhaps someone else can make a better suggestion.  </s>
<s> 8. Section 8 - you ask if anyone has ideas for which checkpoints apply.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> 9. Some of these techniques seem dependent on the PDF Accessibility plug-in.  </s>
<s> Therefore you should reference UAAG and perhaps submit some techniques to them as well.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> I'm anxious to see a mapping to WCAG 2.0 checkpoints because I wonder if you've identified requirements that we don't cover in either WCAG 1.0 or in WCAG 2.0 and that we ought to incorporate in 2.0.  </s>
<s> Thanks again!  </s>
<s> I look forward to your responses.  </s>

<s> A quick response to one of Wendy's comments: The division between WCAG and Authoring Tools has always been, as I understand it, approximately as follows: WCAG defines what the correct markup/data representation should be; AU defines how an authoring tool should prompt the user, what checks it should perform on the document for the purpose of validating accessibility, etc.  </s>
<s> Thus in so far as the PDF techniques are intended to explain what is meant by an accessible PDF file (how content should be represented in it), they belong within the scope of WCAG.  </s>
<s> Although PDF is generally produced by tools rather than direct keyboard entry, this is no reason to move the PDF techniques out of our working group's scope.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it should be stated in the document, clearly, that the techniques will be most relevant to the designers of PDF output software.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, there are web authors who will be using widely available libraries to generate PDF automatically, in which case the library will shield them from the syntactic details of the file format while still exposing the constructs that make up a PDF file.  </s>
<s> Actually, it would be possible to write a fully functional PDF file by hand in a text editor, even though no one does this in practice.  </s>
<s> I did not say that the entire document should be moved to ATAG.  </s>
<s> What I said was that there are sections that discuss what output should be generated which clearly falls into ATAG.  </s>
<s> The tips for people using Adobe tools to generate PDF should clearly stay as WCAG techniques.  </s>
<s> --w  </s>
<s> wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa  </s>
<s> I feel the PDF techniques belong in WCAG rather than ATAG because we are describing what should be true of the PDF file for it to be accessible.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to measure whether a PDF file satisfies the WCAG requirements, no matter what application was used to generate it.  </s>
<s> It may be stretching the parallel, but some HTML is generated by programs and some is hand edited, but we still describe what should be true about the resulting content.  </s>
<s> It is possible to fix some, but not all, of the properties described in these techniques using tools in Acrobat 5. For instance, an author could add Alt tags and fix errors in the logical structure.  </s>
