I joined this list recently, so please be gentle with me if this is a topic that was already discussed here. 
Non-text illustrations (particularly in instruction manuals, or on web pages that deliver the user interface of a hardware, software, or service system) often contain many details that are not relevant to the task at hand. 
This irrelevant content will distract or disable some users, and will slow down, to the point of interfering with productivity, many more. 
I remember (from my days at Bell Labs) a documentation guideline to use line drawings, with relevant information only, rather than photographs (which tend to include irrelevant detail) as illustrations in technical manuals. 
Two questions: 1. 
Is minimizing irrelevant detail something that should be explicitly included in the (upper case G) Guidelines? 2. Is this a valid concern with respect to checkpoint instructions? 
For example, should one be concerned that the "all" in "a text equivalent for _all_ non-text content" will lead developers to include irrelevant elements of illustrations in the replacement text?

Context matters. 
Seldom does *anything* have only one cause. 
Hmm. 
I'm wondering if we need a Compendium of Useful Suggestions in addition to our Capital-G Guidelines. 
There are a number of things which blur the lines between "access" and "usability" and don't fit well into our model of checkpoints, priorities, and so on -- but which are still valid concepts which don't deserve to be forgotten about merely because they don't fit into the framework which we've constructed. 
I feel that this is an important principle. 
But I feel it's also very difficult to codify into a unified, general guideline, let alone a yes/no checkpoint. 
There are a number of other such "good things to do" which, if part of the general "mindset" while creating a page, will lead to more usable/accessible web sites, but which strictly speaking are not binary checkpoints. 
I would hate to have them get lost. 
It's possible. 
Our yes/no approach to checkpoints means that "do a sufficient amount" style requirements must be carefully written and the supporting material must explain exactly what is meant. 
If we provide good examples, we can minimize the possibilities of confusion. 
Also, we may be able to reduce the damage done by promoting both the use of "replacement" and "descriptive" text equivalents. 
ALT vs. LONGDESC -- I'm not sure if anyone feels that you can have "too much longdesc"?

Excellent point! 
After we specify that illustrations should be there, we can tackle helping authors determine how to do it well ... Anne Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com
