<s> With the 8.2 release (Nov 13) on WinXP, pressing Alt- accelerator keys for menus when in editor mode (e.g., Alt-f to open the File menu, Alt-t to open XHTML menu, etc.) causes the menu to open, BUT it also causes the pressed letter (f, t, etc) to be inserted into the document being edited.  </s>
<s> This is a pretty major bug for anyone who might have accessibility problems using a mouse, or just for anyone used to opening menus using Alt- key combinations.  </s>
<s> I kept wondering why I was getting stray "f"s and "v"s in my documents, even when editing source code, until I realized it was a bug.  </s>
