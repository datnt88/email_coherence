<s> I have just tried out the Amaya editor for the first time, primarily to investigate whether we can recommend it to our users for updating their parts of the web site.  </s>
<s> It is the first tool which can be trusted not to rewrite the HTML incorrectly!  </s>
<s> However there is one small glitch, which is manifested with code such as for a table cell: which gets written out after editing the document as: This has added extra blank space following the IMG, which causes the table to render differently in both Netscape and Internet xplorer.  </s>
<s> The effect of this extra space is to misalign the carefully-aligned parts of the table.  </s>
<s> The author of "HTML Tidy" is aware of this problem, which deals with it carefully, but Amaya does not.  </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest a workaround?  </s>
<s> And it would be wonderful if this was fixed in the next release..  </s>
<s> I know this is on the borderline of the markup/layout and browser-dependent rendering issue, but I don't see any harm in a fix which is entirely an HTML indentation and layout matter.  </s>

<s> If you refer to the HTML specification, you will read: SGML (see [ISO8879], section 7.6.1)  </s>
<s> specifies that a line break immediately following a start tag must be ignored, as must a line break immediately before an end tag.  </s>
<s> This applies to all HTML elements without exception.  </s>
<s> The line breaks added by Amaya should not change anything in the way a bowser renders the table.  </s>
<s> IE and NN are wrong.  </s>
<s> Anyway, if this is felt as an annoyance, we can remove these linebreaks in the next release, as the HTML will still be valid.  </s>

<s> The closing td, th, and tr's are optional as well according to HTML 4.0, correct?  </s>
