Addressing note: While I have copied the two working group lists here, to make sure that all members have the same access, please delete the lists from replies indicating your individual contact information. 
This is good for privacy as well as mailbox flood avoidance. 
Replies with contact information such as I requested below should go to Len, Daniel, Wendy, Charles and me, ideally. 
During: IRC:? 
Yes, W3C has a server.? I would be dependent on staff skills to get a channel set up.? If one of the staff people can set up a channel for us, and the person taking notes is comfortable doing this into an IRC client, we can enable monitoring of what is ongoing in the meeting by IRC.? This is how the cross-working-group caucuses [nominally meetings of the chairs of all W3C groups] operate.? For example, Sean and Love could be monitoring the IRC channel and indicate by IRC that they wish to say something, at which point they would either text their comment into IRC or we would call on them by phone. 
Sean, please give us detailed contact information on the following hypotheses: 1) you call us. 
(limited availability because of business demand for the line). 
2) we call you. 
(is there another line?? what would your availability be there?? 
I can't promise two day's worth of we-call-you phone time right off hand.? But we might work something out.? There is precedent for W3C _not_ doing certain forms of teleconference, but there is also precedent for accepting lots of donations from e.g. meeting sponsors.) 3) [no response necessary if true]? 
I am assuming from your remarks that IRC works for you; that you have a client and familiarity with its use sufficient to follow the IRC chat by IRC.? In the Chairs meeting we also dump the IRC log to the Web for those not accustomed to using IRC. 
William, others: Please provide information as above if you wish phone or IRC access (or the IRC log on the Web). 
After: The minimum capability is that people do have a record of the meeting that can be read afterwards.? I would be interested to collect names of people who would like to participate in the following protocol:? 
After you have read the minutes, you can have a one-on-one phone call with someone who was at the meeting.? This one-on-one must be documented to the appropriate working group list(s) in a summary Q&amp;A format.? 
This will allow the group as a whole to discuss and adjust interpretations of what happened in the meeting that are controversial.? In other words, if you wish access to a one-on-one explanation of confusing points in the meeting record, please so indicate and I will try to get action items assigned for people among the attendees to talk to people among the absentees. 
Al Whenever I see the "regrets" thing about a call or F2F it doesn't convey the depth of what I feel at not being able to be with you all the next couple of days. 
As the famous song goes "I second that emotion". 
[It seems I am getting used to the fact that no matter what people ask me to do and where they ask me to go, I will always have to say "sorry, I can't make it".] Hopefully we can still be of some service (see below). 
I hope you can find a way to get me and Sean into at least part of the meetings via the magic of telephony.. Yes. 
Don't forget, the F2F is tomorrow, and I'm still very unclear on what level of participation Mr. Loughborough and I will have. 
Also, I don't have very much phone time, and I have to negotiate before-hand what times I can use the phone (it is a business line, pun with "busyness" line intended). 
I am dearly hoping that some arrangements can be met..... Of course, we could always send notes to the ERT/PF lists, but that would clog peoples boxes up. 
Or the other choice is IRC (I believe that the W3C has a proper IRC conference server). 
Any thoughts? 
Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer We will be using IRC during the ER/PF WG f2f meetings next week to communicate with those who can not attend physically (William and Sean) as well as to take minutes. 
Here is what you need to know: 1. install an IRC client. 
For windows I use mirc (http://www.mirc.com) on linux I use the default IRC client that ships with RedHat. 
2. set up an IRC server in your IRC client. the W3C public server is irc.w3.org port 6665 3. connect to the server. 
4. Join the #erpf-f2f channel. 
We will take minutes on this channel. 
If you have a question during the meeting you can "raise your hand" here and someone watching the channel will make sure the chair recognizes you. 
Let me know if you have any questions, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa O.K., I followed the steps, and it was very easy. 
My only question now is, "what times will the channel be open, and for what conferences (exact times)". 
All I get from http://www.w3.org/2000/10/erpf-f2f-agenda.html is that the F2F is from 8:30 'till 17:00 (that's from 13:30 until 22:00 my time). 
The phone lines are completely free after about 20:00 GMT, so I will be able to IRC for as long as you need me after that! 
Is Mr. Loughborough O.K. with IRC? 
Many thanks, Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer Sean, The channel should be open from about 8:00 until about 17:00 both Monday and Tuesday. 
--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa Great to meet you all in person on Monday. 
I was telling Al Gilman about some work done on evaluation of voting technology by Roy Saltman (from NIST, then the National Bureau of Standards) started in the 1970's. 
His 1993 paper at summarizes a lot of his findings and that fact that his (now deja vu) recommendations were never followed. 
Al thought you might find the paper interesting, especially in light of the possibilities that the internet can now provide.
