<s> I like using IRC as a supplement for telephone conferences.  </s>
<s> W3C has some special tools for attendance, speaker queue management, and so on.  </s>
<s> It's particularly nice if the scribe can take notes in IRC; that way the chair can see if s/he is behind, and other participants can sometimes read stuff that they didn't quite hear clearly.  </s>
<s> If it's convenient, I'd like WG members to join me in an IRC channel, irc://irc.w3.org:6665/dawg during the teleconference.  </s>

<s> We tried to find, among the use cases that had been sent, those that were appealing to several of us and hence merited further development.  </s>
<s> In response to a request to discuss structure, DanC asked that we find one or two specific cases before looking for a general structure.  </s>
<s> DanC reiterated the qualities he suggested the group should be looking for in use cases: The ideal use cases will -- command consensus of this Working Group as a description of a problem we intend to solve (or: solve a part of) -- clarify one or more requitements -- still be relevant when we're at last call, deciding whether we think the spec is done -- engage potential users of our technology and convince some of them to closely review our spec -- be clear and engaging enough to get picked up by journalists and copied into trade press stories -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0009.html  </s>
<s> A few offers to elaborate on specific cases were accepted: ACTION KendallC: refine JS-1, esp the composer/creator version Note: this is on the boundary of the charter, which says..
