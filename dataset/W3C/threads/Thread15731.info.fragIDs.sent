<s> I would argue that designing for colorblindness is an accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> In my previous position I and my team were responsible for automating computer (large mainframe) operations: startup, shutdown, reacting to messages issued by the system, and so on.  </s>
<s> I also developed a system which tracks the status of important resources and sends messages to a single console (monitor) to notify the computer operators of situations requiring their attention or action.  </s>
<s> The monitors (consoles) by which the operators monitor and interact with the system are text-only (generally 80 characters wide by 24 characters/lines high) and limited to seven colors.  </s>
<s> * The colors of the system and notification messages?  </s>
<s> As dictated by an ISO standard (if anyone has a URL for this, please post), Green for good, all clear; Red for critical problem.  </s>
<s> * Accessibility issue?  </s>
<s> Red-green colorblindness.  </s>
<s> "Good" and "Critical" messages could appear the same!  </s>
<s> * Accessibility solution?  </s>
<s> Redundant information.  </s>
<s> Modify the beginning of the text of the message with an indicator of the relative severity of the problem, such as adding a suffix to the message-id, an asterisk "*" to the message-id if the operator had to respond immedaitely, and so on.  </s>
<s> Accessibility considerations aside, redundant information is a general human-factors design strategy.  </s>
<s> * Beneficial "side-effect"?  </s>
<s> When operators print the screens, they can still recognize the severity of the messages, even though the printed page is black and white.  </s>
<s> Another example of how designing for accessibility improves conditions for everyone.  </s>
