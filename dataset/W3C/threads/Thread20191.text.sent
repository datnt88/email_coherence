I am trying to use the HTML parser of Amaya. 
(compiled html2thot.c 
in STANDALONE mode). 
I've parsed an HTML file into a Document. 
I then try to save the document back to another HTML file using TtaExportDocument(Document doc, char* fileName, "HTMLT"); (The last parameter is either "HTMLT" or "HTMLT.TRA". 
I am sending the mail from my NT boot and my development env is in my Linux boot and I need to reboot into Linux to know exactly which. 
Anyway, I got the value by looking at the code in HTMLSave.c 
file) The resulting HTML file is nothing like the original HTML file. 
It lost its TITLE and the BODY. 
What am I doing wrong here?

We didn't test the standalone version of the Amaya HTML parser for a while but there is no reason for not generating the TITLE and the BODY if they are there in the original document. 
An extra-code in Amaya adds these elements if they are not present. 
Perhaps you need to add part of that extra-code.

Thanks for the response Irene. 
I resolved this problem a couple of days back but hadn't got around to letting you know. 
The placement of the compilation directive (STANDALONE) in html2thot.c is wrong. 
The HTML file is not parsed correctly into the document. 
I will send you the modifications I made as soon as I can spare a moment (probably tomorrow). 
Also, the HTML parser in standalone mode should only need libThotKernel and libz. 
However, libThotKernel as it is built using the makefile in 'Amaya/obj/thotlib' does not allow this. 
Some of the object files (*.o) had to be changed to (*ND.o) by the appropriate insertion of the 'NODISPLAY' compilation directive in the source code.

OK I'll integrate your modifications. 
Is your proposal to force the building of the libThotKernel in the "make html2piv"? 
Irene.
