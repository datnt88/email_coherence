<s> As is not HTML, the meta element is not a meta element and cannot be examined by a conforming browser to fix the problem, but IE says it starts html so it must be HTML, even if it is really the source code of an HTML page to demonstrate the source.  </s>

<s> Hi everyone, read the list but don't contribute often I'm afraid!  </s>
<s> I think from the perspective of the public good the article highlights the positive effect accessibility can have on people who have been traditionally marginalised by the development of information technology (people with disabilities, the elderly, people who are illeteriate etc).  </s>
<s> However I belief the incentives for accessibility (beyond the public good i.e. within the private sector) are driven by their adoption by mass markets.  </s>
<s> For example, OCR technology was pioneered to make print more accessible for the blind, yet solicitors, journalists, researchers etc all use those little OCR pens to scan and record print material and OCR technology is widly available and popular because it had commercial applications.  </s>
<s> Currently accessibiliy is a growing priority with responsible bodies in the private sector - social responsibility and putting back into the community etc - but there is little point in getting outraged at an airline becuse it's website is inaccessible - you need to either legislate for accessibility or provide a commerical incentive.  </s>
<s> The incentives are there (as the Jacobs article demonstrated) but is it the case that the incentives are not enough for certain organisations?  </s>
<s> It's can't be ignorance alone can it?  </s>
<s> I think most of us already know what is wrong with the page in terms of markup and accessibility.  </s>
<s> If any of you have actually been able to read it, what I would like to know is if the writer's points are actually valid?  </s>
<s> Is it the kind of thing that could persuade clients to take an active interest in web accessibility?  </s>
<s> I think a discussion on that might be more beneficial to the list.  </s>
