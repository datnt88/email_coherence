That's because IE is broken as a matter of policy (basically because you get less support calls for this sort of error if you are broken than if you operate correctly). 
The fact that it attempts to be in Windows-1252, also indicates its an IE only site, which is particular bad as they are using Apache on Unix. 
I think they have captured the source of a dynamic page and are serving it as a static page, but haven't updated their .htaccess 
file to tell the server that .asp is a type of text/html. 
The HTTP headers are as follows. 
Note that they clearly say that it 
is plain text, not HTML. 
As is not HTML, the meta element is not a meta element and cannot be examined by a conforming browser to fix the problem, but IE says it starts html so it must be HTML, even if it is really the source code of an HTML page to demonstrate the source.

The HTML is also broken, as you might expect from Front Page. 
It's got p within b, and, of course, a lot of presentational markup. 
I can confirm that Mozilla 1.2a does the same - as will any browser that honours the text/plain MIME type. 
I also note the use of deprecated tags and an ASCII representation of the copyright symbol rather than &amp;copy; - oops... Cheers M Matthew Smith | Business: http://www.kbc.net.au

I really don't know why I subscribe to this list. 
The behavior of a few of its members is typified by the responses to Mike Burks' offering of Steve Jacobs' article on the "Business Benefits of Access-for-All Design." 
Eight messages responding to Mike's message and not ONE, repeat, not one, message which was on topic. 
I know there are lots of folks who subscribe to this list. 
Do you all appreciate this nit-picking. 
Am I in fact the only one who is the odd-ball-out, who is sick of the process that typifies this list?

The HTML is also broken, as you might expect from Front Page. 
It's got p within b, and, of course, a lot of presentational markup. 
If we accept the original posting as on-topic, then so surely is a message pointing out that the article itself is not readable due to a server configuration error, and likewise David Woolley's explanation of why it is unreadable (I might well have posted that myself if David hadn't got there first). 
OK, there were further MeToo posts as tends to happen in any public forum. 
Bringing it back to relatively on-topic, I have in the past worked with clients who use frontpage to generate relatively-sane markup. 
This was a convoluted process, including extensive user-training, validation to a custom-DTD, and cleanup tools for the FP-generated markup. 
Not recommended, but not entirely impossible. 
On the subject of the MSIE bug, it's a Halloween-ism. 
And I'm on record as describing this before we even had the original Halloween documents!

I've seen a lot of comments regarding the accessibility of this page, but I think most of us already know what is wrong with the page in terms of markup and accessibility. 
If any of you have actually been able to read it, what I would like to know is if the writer's points are actually valid? 
Is it the kind of thing that could persuade clients to take an active interest in web accessibility? 
I think a discussion on that might be more beneficial to the list.

I personally think that this has been a fantastic discussion and not at all 
off topic. 
I have learnt something about accessibility that I was unaware of before. 
It has definitely highlighted that it is down to not only developers, but also ISP's to be aware of what affects accessiblity. 
Also interesting to see the debate it sparked about it being off topic. 
I can't honestly understand why anyone who is interested in accessibility could able to state that a discusssion about why a particular page is inaccessible ato certain browsers as being off topic. 
I think what made it more poignant was the fact it was an article about accessibility that was guilty. 
So close to home. 
Yes the article is beneficial to the list, but it is hard to judge whether the article content or the discussion about its inaccessability was more beneficial. 
I personally think the latter.

Hi everyone, read the list but don't contribute often I'm afraid! 
I think from the perspective of the public good the article highlights the positive effect accessibility can have on people who have been traditionally marginalised by the development of information technology (people with disabilities, the elderly, people who are illeteriate etc). 
However I belief the incentives for accessibility (beyond the public good i.e. within the private sector) are driven by their adoption by mass markets. 
For example, OCR technology was pioneered to make print more accessible for the blind, yet solicitors, journalists, researchers etc all use those little OCR pens to scan and record print material and OCR technology is widly available and popular because it had commercial applications. 
Currently accessibiliy is a growing priority with responsible bodies in the private sector - social responsibility and putting back into the community etc - but there is little point in getting outraged at an airline becuse it's website is inaccessible - you need to either legislate for accessibility or provide a commerical incentive. 
The incentives are there (as the Jacobs article demonstrated) but is it the case that the incentives are not enough for certain organisations? 
It's can't be ignorance alone can it? 
I think most of us already know what is wrong with the page in terms of markup and accessibility. 
If any of you have actually been able to read it, what I would like to know is if the writer's points are actually valid? 
Is it the kind of thing that could persuade clients to take an active interest in web accessibility? 
I think a discussion on that might be more beneficial to the list.
