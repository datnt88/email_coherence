<s> From: Hans-Werner Heinzen hwheinzen@t-online.de  </s>
<s> Dear Sir, playing around with the representation of hierarchical structures in a database, I got a bit excited when, browsing the W3C site, I stumbled over N3. Mainly for learning reasons I started to translate Your "Primer: Getting into RDF &amp; Semantic Web using N3" into german.  </s>
<s> Now that I finished this piece of work, I would like to publish it on my website which is Bitloeffel.de.  </s>
<s> Since the document is not a Technical Report, I ask for Your permission here.  </s>
<s> The publication will look like the attached HTML-file.  </s>
<s> There are other documents I'm interested in, so there may be some other translations to follow.  </s>

<s> Hans-Werner, I have a bad news for you: you are not the first one translating N3 ;-) Look at where a Japanese translation is already listed... So, seriously, of course there is no problem putting this on the official list.  </s>
