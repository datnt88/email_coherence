From: Hans-Werner Heinzen hwheinzen@t-online.de 
Dear Sir, playing around with the representation of hierarchical structures in a database, I got a bit excited when, browsing the W3C site, I stumbled over N3. Mainly for learning reasons I started to translate Your "Primer: Getting into RDF &amp; Semantic Web using N3" into german. 
Now that I finished this piece of work, I would like to publish it on my website which is Bitloeffel.de. 
Since the document is not a Technical Report, I ask for Your permission here. 
The publication will look like the attached HTML-file. 
There are other documents I'm interested in, so there may be some other translations to follow. 
Thanks for reading this, Yours sincerely Hans-Werner Heinzen E-Mail: hwheinzen@t-online.de

Hans-Werner, I have a bad news for you: you are not the first one translating N3 ;-) Look at where a Japanese translation is already listed... So, seriously, of course there is no problem putting this on the official list. 
Just give me the final URI when it is available and I will add it to our database Ivan Hans-Werner Heinzen wrote on 15/03/2004 15:20:
