<s> Hi, I encountered the following problems in the core specification: - The NotMyChildException that is thrown in some Node operations doesn't appear in the Node interface definition.  </s>
<s> - The explanation of the operation Node.getNodeType() says an enum is used to indicate the type while that is not true anymore.  </s>
<s> By the way, it is better to use constants instead of enums because code would break when new types are added.  </s>
<s> In fact none of the two are necessary because we already have CORBA::Object::is_a().  </s>
<s> - It isn't specified where the iterator returned by Node.getChildNodes() is positioned, i.e. at the first node or before the first one.  </s>
<s> Both policies can be encountered in public libraries.  </s>
<s> For the moment I assume it is positioned at the first node.  </s>
<s> - NodeIterator.toNth() should also return NoSuchNodeException if the argument is negative because the argument type is not unsigned.  </s>
<s> - NodeIterator.toNth() is inconsistent.  </s>
<s> It says it returns null if the iteration leads to a position beyond the end of the list.  </s>
<s> It also says it throws a NoSuchException if the argument is greater that NodeIterator.getLength().  </s>
<s> - The TreeIterator interface isn't used anywhere.  </s>
<s> As it is a general purpose tree iterator it could be simply created on its own and initialized with some Node from where navigaton should start.  </s>
<s> The following should then be added in the Document interface: TreeIterator createTreeIterator(in Node startPoint);  </s>
<s> - I see no reason why Document should be derived from DocumentFragment.  </s>
<s> - Element.attributes should be called Element.getAttributes to be consistent.  </s>
<s> - The explanation of getElementsByTagName in Document and Element says: "Returns an iterator through all subordinate Elements with a given tag name."  </s>
<s> If I understand this, the iterator will see only a subset of the subordinate elements selected with a tag name.  </s>
<s> In that case there should be an argument.  </s>
<s> It could also mean that all subordinate elements are returned ordered by the tag name.  </s>
<s> In that case the explanation is not correct.  </s>
<s> This meaning is not very usefull anyway in my opinion.  </s>
<s> - Everything in the XML specification that has to do with the document type  </s>
<s> definition, ie almost the whole of it, should be in Core because it is  </s>
<s> common to XML and HTML.  </s>
<s> In HTML a number of operations will return empty lists of course.  </s>
<s> Note that the Attribute interface refers to document type information.  </s>
<s> - I think Element.attributes should be Element.getAttributes.  </s>
<s> - Is Element.normalize recursive?  </s>
<s> - The sentence below Text.delete is wrong.  </s>
<s> - The explanation of Text.splice is quite obscure.  </s>
<s> What happens to the original node?  </s>
<s> Why isn't the inserted element not also just a sibling of the original node?  </s>
<s> A general comment: It would be nice if the types of the arguments were included in the specifications of the individual operations.  </s>

<s> Thanks for your very perceptive comments; those that are outright errors will be fixed, those that call for discussion will be discussed!  </s>
<s> A few questions/comments:  </s>
<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> It's a special type of DocumentFragment that has addtional properties that pertain only to "top-level"documents?  </s>
<s> There is a strong feeling that the Core should be as small as possible, and that any objects that are not relevant to HTML users should not be represented in Core.  </s>
<s> Do you see a serious problem with leaving DTDs out of Core?  </s>
<s> Yes. Mike Champion  </s>
<s> No I don't.  </s>
<s> The Core and XML parts are the ones that interest me the most and I will be using them together anyway.  </s>
<s> I understand it would be unusual to consult the DTD when working with a HTML document.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking this could be possible however, because an implicit DTD is always present for HTML.  </s>
<s> But it is indeed not important.  </s>
<s> Regards, Werner Donn?  </s>

<s> And indeed not desirable as a requirement for a HTML DOM implementor.  </s>
<s> The DOM group is aiming for a specification that is complete, yet practical, both for implementors and users.  </s>
