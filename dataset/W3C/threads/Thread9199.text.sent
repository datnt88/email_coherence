By the way, my boss (Dr Saarela), would like me to pose a couple of questions to the group for consideration... 
What's the judgement on type IDs (range values etc in RDF) now that the XML Schema spec is a Recommendation? 
Arity -- never sure if that's a legitimate word -- can the minOccurs, maxOccurs attributes be copied over to RDF definition? 
And another issue worth working on (but I think it's already active): digital signing of resources (I guess this brings up questions of canonicality of documents and hence works against my `resource is as resource does' liberal approach). 
Is rights management in general part of our concern now that we are drifting over to the question of legality of RDF assertion?

Martyn, Lets remind ourselves what the WG charter says: ... fixes, clarifications and improvements to the specification of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax. 
and ... to complete the work on RDF vocabulary description present in the RDF Schema Candidate Recommendation. 
We are doing what TBL in Hong Kong characterized as a "clean up" of the rdf specs. 
To that end we are using an issue led process. 
There are issues with the current specifications and we are going to try to resolve those issues. 
The chairs have the job of scheduling the order that we tackle the issues to optimise our progress. 
It might be useful to review the charter and issues list with your boss. 
I'm not clear exactly what you mean here. 
What issue does this relate to? 
Has it been scheduled for discussion? 
Do you wish to propose that it be scheduled for early discussion? 
Why? 
How does it relate to XML Schema's progression to recommendation? 
I don't believe this is on the current issues list. 
If you wish to propose it as an issue, please can you write it up and submit it as a new issue for consideration. 
Your write up should clearly indicate why it is desirable to support arity constraints at the RDF schema level rather than in the ontology layer. 
I should say, that my first reaction is that this would be an extension to the current specification, not a fix to a current problem and that I'm not sympathetic to extensions being in scope. 
In general, in scheduling issues I'm trying to balance a desire to knock off some easy wins, resolve issues which are causing developers and others immediate concern quickly with a preference for starting with the the basic RDF model and working upwards. 
There is no such issue on the issues list. 
Again, feel free to propose one, but I'd suggest you review the charter before submitting it. 
No. Brian I believe the issue referred to is: and I think it should be considered that the DAML program has already developed a solution to this issue in their most recent DAML release. 
Perhaps the DAML work could be linked to from the issues list?

I'm working on something like this for CC/PP, and have come up with the following: This class is used to represent any CC/PP attribute value that is an integer number. 
rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource= 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/xmlschema-2.html#integer'/ where &amp;ns-xsdt; expands to the XMLschema datatypes schema URI. 
I think they should be left for the logic layer work (DAML+OIL, etc.) I think this is out of scope for RDFcore. 
#g This does have a # on the end, right? 
rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource='&amp;ns-rdfs;Literal'/ Have you seen how DAML does this? 
Instead of: you may wish to be consistent.
