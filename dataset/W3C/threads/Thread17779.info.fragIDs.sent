<s> Hello, As per my action item in today's teleconf (raw minutes available at [1]), here is a proposed structure for how UAs can claim media-dependent conformance: 1) The document lists a finite number of "media types", based on, but not limited to, those defined by the CSS2 specification [2].  </s>
<s> 2) In the guidelines document, each media type is defined (only) as a set of priority 1 techniques.  </s>
<s> Thus, for example, the "tty" media type (or perhaps the term should be "UA type") might include 13  </s>
<s> techniques, to be selected by the WG.  </s>
<s> The "handheld" media type might include 17 other techniques.  </s>
<s> A media type thus establishes a subset of Priority 1 techniques to which a UA may claim conformance.  </s>
<s> 3) Note that this eliminates any English language description of what a User Agent must do to qualify as rendering to a given media type.  </s>
<s> An English language description will necessarily be incomplete and should not be used for measuring conformance.  </s>
<s> Conformance will simply be to a subset of Pri 1 techniques as chosen by the Working Group.  </s>
<s> We should also include em informative /em text about what the WG had in mind when defining the media types, but the definition only is about a subset of techniques.  </s>
<s> The goal of this proposal is to allow (force) the UA Working Group to specify coherent subsets required for conformance rather than allowing (or forcing) User Agent developers to decide which techniques it feels are important to implement.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNeville has expressed concern that the WG, by choosing subsets, will make conformance difficult for some User Agents that can't implement all the techniques in that subset.  </s>
<s> I propose, therefore, a "core" set of Pri 1 techniques that must be implemented by all User Agents.  </s>
<s> Thus, a User Agent not able to implement a larger subset of the techniques would at least have to conform to the core subset.  </s>
<s> In addition, we might add a clause to the effect that in addition to the core subset, UAs must implement those techniques relating to what they do (e.g., any UA that does sound has to do the techniques related to sound) and common sense will be the measure of which techniques are appropriate.  </s>
<s> I feel that leaving that choice to the UA weakens the definition of conformance, however, and I prefer just defining a "core" subset.  </s>
<s> All comments about this proposal are welcome, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-telecon-19981216.txt [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> Let me offer UI profile as a technical term that is correct and let the editors worry about how to explain this to readers.  </s>
<s> The point is that this is one step removed from media types as used in HTML and CSS and so we should not use the same term.  </s>
<s> A UI profile states what resources are available for interaction with the user, preferenably in terms of a rough capability bin and not too exact detail.  </s>
<s> In other words all color graphics displays of greater than eight colors and greater than 640X480 pixels could be treated as one capability bin (not less than 50 Hz refresh, ...).  </s>
<s> Note that the media types as used in HTML and CSS only pertain to the display function.  </s>
<s> The failure modes that keep people from using the normal mouse command IF of the GUI desktop computing platform can be either in inability to control the mouse or in inability to interpret the screen cursor.  </s>
<s> The mouse command sub-function in the GUI is a closed loop of display and control sub-functions; a failure in any of these sub-functions breaks the loop and defeats the composite function.  </s>
<s> Text plays a central role in display diversity because of all data representations in current use, it has the widest fanout across display media.  </s>
<s> Likewise keyboard commands have a comparable central role in command diversity because AT to map alternative devices into keyboard emulation is highly developed and widely available.  </s>
<s> So mapping keyboard commands into alternate devices is readily attainable by the user.  </s>
<s> Mapping other command modes into suitable alternative devices is more risky.  </s>
<s> This is parallel to why we shadow video with audio descriptions and text descriptions.  </s>
<s> The video only works for a narrow class of devices; the text is more mappable to alternatives.  </s>
<s> The content we have to presume is multimedia.  </s>
<s> The trick is to map the constellation of content components into the constellation of UI components that are in the user's selected/adaptive profile.  </s>
<s> I think we are getting somewhere if we define UI profiles as collections of device capabilities.  </s>
<s> HTTP/CSS media classes are examples of device capabilities.  </s>
<s> Including a device capability in the UI profile means that the software can expect the user to use this capability.  </s>
<s> Then for each profile analyzed, you can come up with a corresponding technique profile of the minimum techniques needed to be effective in this UI profile context.  </s>
<s> Then for each software product, it can claim it supports X UI profile natively (because it implements some superset of the minimum techniques) and Y UI profile through adaptability (if it supports an add-on interface and there are widely available add-ons which take this interface and complete a UA configuration providing the rest of the necessary techniques for Y UI profile.  </s>
<s> Because the UI techniques actually depend on closing the loop through multiple devices, I think we need to treat conformance in terms of UI profiles, not UI components individually.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Actually, my concern is that if we provide a specification which is incomplete, then two problems may arise: 1) The document will not help User Agents which do not fit the categories we produce.  </s>
<s> 2) Currently the techniques document says: 1.1 Media dependencies  </s>
<s> Not all user agents are capable of rendering natively all media types (e.g., audio, video, etc.) or all formats within a given media type.  </s>
<s> Similarly, not all user agents are capable of rendering to all target devices (e.g., screen, paper, braille device, etc.) The techniques in this document are meant to be implemented by user agents that support the relative media types.  </s>
<s> Thus, for example, if a user agent renders video natively, it should implement the techniques relating to video.  </s>
<s> Or, if a user agent does not render to a visual device, it is not required to satisfy the font or color techniques.  </s>
<s> In this document, we refer to a user agent that is capable of performing a specific task natively as an enabled user agent.  </s>
<s> An enabled user agent must implement a Priority 1 technique when it is enabled for that technique.  </s>
<s> This formulation effectively provides for a test by common sense in any given case.  </s>
<s> If we specify the media types (or Agent profiles, or whatever) then I think we are significantly weakening that test by common sense.  </s>
<s> In view of the rapid nature of change on the web I feel that is a bad strategy.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, as I understand it I am the only person in the working group who feels this way.  </s>
<s> So having recorded my concern, I feel that unless people really want to follow it up I will defer to the group and we need not discuss it further.  </s>

<s> We don't know that we have identified sufficient techniques for such a User Agent.  </s>
<s> If there is a User Agent that operates in an environment (UI profile) that we didn't anticipate and analyze, we are not prepared to say what techniques are required in that environment.  </s>
<s> They can study the techniques, but we haven't done the necessary homework to make a prescription for that case.  </s>
<s> [snip...]  </s>
<s> I think that what we are wrestling with is the following: this positive statement is not the correct test.  </s>
<s> Keyboard access to on-mouse-over events is not so much required for User Agents where the keyboard is enabled.  </s>
<s> It is required where the mouse is disabled.  </s>
<s> The correlation between UI capabilities and techniques is negative; lacking one, one requires the other.  </s>
<s> We need alternate paths for those user dialog strategies which assume device capabilities which are not supported in the user's selected UI profile or use pattern.  </s>
<s> Well, you could be onto something we all missed.  </s>
<s> Does this reasoning make sense to you?  </s>
