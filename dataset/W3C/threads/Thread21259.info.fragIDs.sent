<s> If users select that they want to show e-mail address when they annotate something it works fine, but when they select Family and Given name it is currently shown as some mysterious address like X021796.  </s>
<s> This is probably because we collect the names separately to a structure, but (if I understand it correctly) dc:creator is just a string of the two names:  </s>
<s> I'm not sure where this needs to be corrected.  </s>
<s> Could we have more structure in dc:creator so that the applications could use it too or just ask the server to put the two names together to a string?  </s>

<s> Many people believe that dc:creator should point to a new RDF resource, with properties coming off of that, as opposed to just a text string.  </s>
<s> Something like: #annotation dc:creator :X10101 .  </s>
<s> :X10101 dc:title "Aaron Swartz" foaf:given "Aaron" ; foaf:family "Swartz" ; foaf:mbox mailto:me@aaronsw.com .  </s>
<s> I'd think this is perfectly acceptable, because it contains the structured information, as well as the dc:title value for simpler processors that just want a string.  </s>

<s> I basically agree with this, but I'd suggest doing it as a non-binary relation (RDF M&amp;S section 7.3) and using rdf:value instead of (or in addition to) dc:title.  </s>
<s> The RDF processor might not know that the property dc:title is more appropriate than the others as a default literal value.  </s>
<s> It does know that rdf:value is special.  </s>
<s> As an aside, two vocabularies that lend themselves to describing structured personal names are vCard and X.500.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the following: dc:creator :X10101 .  </s>
<s> :X10101 rdf:value "Aaron Swartz" x500:cn "Aaron Swartz" x500:givenName "Aaron" x500:sn "Swartz" x500:mail mailto:me@aaronsw.com .  </s>
<s> Ideally, you'd infer the rdf:value statement from the x500:cn (or dc:title) statement rather than duplicating the literal "Aaron Swartz" in the source statements, but expressing the inference rule would have to be done outside of RDF.  </s>

<s> Yes, but in this situation, I think rdf:value might be too special.  </s>
<s> rdf:value seems to imply that the other properties are qualifications of the primary value, not properties of a resource.  </s>
<s> The example given in the spec is: rdf:value "500" ; :measurement :pounds .  </s>

<s> We're not doing that here, we're instead providing a title, so dc:title is more appropriate.  </s>
