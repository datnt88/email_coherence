I believe that the HTTP spec is wrong, and should say that 2xx responses to HEAD must not contain a body, but other responses should. 
We're having a problem reconciling the HTTP 1.1 spec with what servers are actually doing. 
The HTTP spec says (section 4.3, message body): For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with a message is dependent on both the request method and the response status code (section 6.1.1). 
All responses to the HEAD request method MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity- header fields might lead one to believe they do. 
All 1xx (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body. 
All other responses do include a message-body, although it may be of zero length. 
and also 9.4 HEAD The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. 
The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. 
This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. 
This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification. 
But, in spite of this, every server we test against (and every one we've written ourselves) returns a body on ERROR responses to the HEAD request (e.g., HTML explaining the error on a 400, 401, 404, and so on). 
Umh. 
Neither Apache, IIS, or iPlanet exhibit the brokenness you describe, at least not in their default configurations when requesting a document that gives a 404. 
I suggest you look again... And make sure you haven't been insulted by having a so-called transparent proxy (aka. 
demon box from hell aka. 
"worst products ever") between you and the servers you are testing against. 
That would be contrary to all past discussion of HEAD and all implementations of HTTP prior to 1997. 
The only origin server that I know of that returns a body on HEAD requests is IIS when used with an ASP object that takes complete control of the socket and ignores the HTTP spec. 
All other instances of that behavior have been from broken firewall proxies or gateways. 
It certainly does not constitute a correct implementation. 
....Roy OK, OK, I blew it. 
The spec is right, the implementations tested (below) were wrong. 
Sorry Larry
