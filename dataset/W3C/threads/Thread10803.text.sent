On 30 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question. 
A straw poll indicates the question needs further discussion in the work group. 
D.2 Should XML provide shorthand ways of summarizing the salient points a document's DTD? * empty elements * mixed-content or element-content elements * required attributes * default attribute values * identity of ID and IDREF(S) attributes * identity of CONREF attributes (if allowed) * other? 
If so, * D.2 a. Should such short-hand summaries be required? 
* D.2 b. Allowed in place of DTDs? 
* D.2 c. Allowed in addition to DTDs? * D.2 d. 
If so, is inconsistency between the DTD and the summary an error? 
* D.2.e. 
A reportable error? 
of I can't tell if the question is asking if we should consider partial DTDs using the syntax of 8879 DTDs or if it is asking if we should develop another syntax for partial DTDs. 
I'm assuming the former. 
I think we should allow partial DTDs using the syntax of 8879 DTDs. 
They should not be required, since we seem bent on allowing at least some processing of XML without any DTD. 
For me, it doesn't make sense to talk of partial DTDs in addition to (full) DTDs, since for me a full DTD is just a partial DTD that has declarations for all markup in the given instance. 
Either a tool insists on declarations for everything and complains when it encounters some markup for which there is no declaration, or it manages to silently plug along when it encounters something for which there is no declaration. 
So, I go for D.2.b. provided the syntax for our "shorthand ways of summarizing" is 8879 declarations. 
(If my assumption about syntax is wrong, let me know, and I'll re-evaluate my response.) On Thu, 24 Oct 96 14:09:05 CDT, Michael Sperberg-McQueen U35395@UICVM.UIC.EDU No. Use the simplified markup declaration syntax. 
No. The DTD can be used if they aren't present. 
Yes. 
If you must have them, they cannot coexist with DTDs for the reason given below. 
No, because the two could conflict. 
Yes. 
Yes, which would require you to parse both of them, so why have the shorthand. 
Conclusion: Stick with DTDs, but allow the external subset or all of the DTD to be ignored if not needed to parse the document instance.
