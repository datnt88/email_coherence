I am interested to translate HTML and XML documentation into Farsi and Turkish. 
Farsi in specific for the Afghanistan. 
I want to make sure I do the right licensing and will be for free for world wide use. 
However, I need someone to talk to me about which documents to start that will be most useful for places like Afghnistan.

Yes it will be for free. 
The concept is that a kid in a village in Afghanistan has to work for 100 years to afford an O'Reilly book on HTML .. so I decided to take the manuals from your site and translate say to Farsi and provide FOR FREE to them. 
This is very key to the success of the project and we are hoping to finance the project by the good will of people interested to advance the causes of the education at the third world.
