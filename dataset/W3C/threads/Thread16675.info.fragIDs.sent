<s> Would be 'cool' to have anyone using an assitive device use a special program that register were PWDs are going and have that information collected somewhere.  </s>
<s> The trick would be the privacy hurdle, bandwith and 'big brother' fear.  </s>
<s> But I do not know how else to do this.  </s>
<s> Need to get numbers and stats to prove the point to the commercial world that we are a market force to listen too.  </s>
<s> I know double click and other use this methodology.  </s>
<s> I stopped marketing from using it for the privacy issues.  </s>
<s> Cookies are one thing, but accessing information is another.  </s>
<s> This could send anonymous information to a trusted source for collection and data mining.  </s>
<s> Name could be optional, but think if we could get zip code, city, state, and income level.  </s>
<s> This could also be a money making adventure to turn money back into the PWD community to further research.  </s>
<s> I wonder if we could get media metrix and pcdataonline to do this, because you need to volunteer to be a member of their research community.  </s>
<s> They could also collect the methodology you use to track the web.  </s>
<s> This may be a easier route to go.  </s>
<s> Will ask media metrix.  </s>

<s> Regards, rob Rob, I've seen buying power numbers but, given the low employment figures for people with disabilities (which I think should be relatively accurate), I'm not sure how much confidence I have in anyone's buying power number.  </s>
<s> I might change my mind if I were also given the assumptions used to come up with these numbers.  </s>
<s> With respect to dollars spent online, how can anyone tell when the spending is by or for someone with a disability?  </s>
<s> My browser doesn't provide the info that I have a disability.  </s>
