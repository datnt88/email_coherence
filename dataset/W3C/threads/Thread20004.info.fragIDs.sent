<s> How does Amaya handle the POST method in a form with a relative URL?  </s>
<s> For example, go to http://arxiv.org/format/cs/0007009  </s>
<s> The first three forms on this page (for creating PostScript and PDF) have a GET method while the last form (DVI) has a POST method with action="/dvi/cs/0007009".  </s>
<s> Amaya cannot load this file.  </s>
<s> Is this a bug in Amaya or should the method be GET rather than POST?  </s>

<s> Hello Karl-Michael, In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said:  </s>
<s> The HTML in that page is OK. What can be discussed is using a POST for getting the file, as it's not justified in this case.  </s>
<s> I tested it and it works for me (under Linux).  </s>
<s> The relative URLs are well solved in all the above cases.  </s>
<s> Note that the DVI file is in fact a .tar.gz file, as noted in the download page.  </s>
<s> However, the file that is returned doesn't say so (0007009 is the file name).  </s>
<s> I renamed it to test.tgz, and I was then able to make a tar -xzf and read the dvi file.  </s>
<s> Did you try to change the filename when Amaya proposes you to download it?  </s>

<s> Hi Karl, Your submit button doesn't provide an attribute name which is mandatory and should be sent to the server.  </s>
<s> I suspect that your server in the first three forms doesn't take care about the parameter.  </s>
<s> It's why the result is OK.  </s>
<s> I suggest you to set the attribute name instead of the attribute value.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
