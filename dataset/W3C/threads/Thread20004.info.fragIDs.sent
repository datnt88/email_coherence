How does Amaya handle the POST method in a form with a relative URL? 
For example, go to http://arxiv.org/format/cs/0007009 
The first three forms on this page (for creating PostScript and PDF) have a GET method while the last form (DVI) has a POST method with action="/dvi/cs/0007009". 
Amaya cannot load this file. 
Is this a bug in Amaya or should the method be GET rather than POST?

Hello Karl-Michael, In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said: 
The HTML in that page is OK. What can be discussed is using a POST for getting the file, as it's not justified in this case. 
I tested it and it works for me (under Linux). 
The relative URLs are well solved in all the above cases. 
Note that the DVI file is in fact a .tar.gz file, as noted in the download page. 
However, the file that is returned doesn't say so (0007009 is the file name). 
I renamed it to test.tgz, and I was then able to make a tar -xzf and read the dvi file. 
Did you try to change the filename when Amaya proposes you to download it?

Hi Karl, Your submit button doesn't provide an attribute name which is mandatory and should be sent to the server. 
I suspect that your server in the first three forms doesn't take care about the parameter. 
It's why the result is OK. 
I suggest you to set the attribute name instead of the attribute value. 
Irene.
