draft-aboba-rtp-http draft-petke-http-auth-scheme Larry Masinter: By the way: a slightly updated safe internet draft was submitted yesterday. 
See for a copy. 
The main new message in the draft is: we have to solve the `unnecessary confirmation dialog' problem, and work on other solutions being absent, we have to solve it with the Safe header. 
I put this message in the draft because I won't be there to say it in person. 
Koen. 
Larry, Due to the amount of information that needs to be presented at the Monday morning Opening Plenary, the first working group session will not start until 10:00 so it will only be a 1-1/2 hour session. 
You may want to adjust your agenda to reflect this. 
Thanks, Marcia I have stored ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/masinter/draft-goland-http-headers-00.txt and linked it into the http-wg-agenda in the same directory.
