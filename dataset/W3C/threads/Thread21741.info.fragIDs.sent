<s> Ted, Max, Martin, Dom, In reply to a "customer feedback" request[18Mar] regarding GRDDL, Masahide Kanzaki pointed out that our XSLT service would be more useful to Japanese authors learning about the Semantic Web if it support Shift_JIS.  </s>
<s> He relayed the following clues, after I told him our service was based on Saxon.  </s>
<s> Oops; I see it's actually "a simple wrapper around James Clark's XT".  </s>
<s> Anyway, please consider adding Shift_JIS support to the XSLT service.  </s>
<s> use xerce as the parser for Saxon: java -Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet  </s>
<s> ... Info will be found at To use Shift_JIS with Saxon, change PluggableCharacterSet in saxon7.jar  </s>
<s> as: import net.sf.saxon.charcode.PluggableCharacterSet; and execute: java -D"encoding.Shift_JIS"="SAXON_Shift_JIS"  </s>
<s> net.sf.saxon.Transform  </s>

<s> [18Mar] Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May?  </s>
<s> Hello Dan,  </s>
<s> We should definitely make sure that our XSLT service can be used with more than just a few simple encodings.  </s>
<s> Just adding Shift_jis doesn't really a good idea.  </s>
<s> It could be that xsltproc on our machines already supports a lot of encodings (if it is complied with iconv support).  </s>
<s> So that would be an additional possibility.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much for taking the encoding issue.  </s>
<s> True, Shift_Jis is just an example.  </s>
<s> I found many Japanese weblogs (which would be good candidates of GRDDL customers) use EUC-JP, probably because it's easy to work with some database systems.  </s>
<s> Certainly authors around the world use variety of languages/encodings. regards, KANZAKI, Masahide a.k.a. masaka #Please use above address for a personal mail #instead of post@kanzaki.com,  </s>
<s> which is for list only.  </s>
