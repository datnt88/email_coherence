<s> At our meeting today it was suggested (and we all agreed) to make all the SHORT TITLES conform to the same part of speech.  </s>
<s> The list we came up with was.  </s>
<s> Perceivable Operable Navigable (including Orientation) Understandable Technology Robust  </s>
<s> In the meeting I had suggested the "Navigable (including Orientation)" form.  </s>
<s> It was the best I/we could come up with.  </s>
<s> I would like to now suggest that we just drop the parenthetical and have Perceivable Operable Navigable Understandable Technology Robust I don't think dropping orientation is a problem.  </s>
<s> It still appears in the long form of that item.  </s>
<s> And the idea of orientation is implied by the combination of Navigable and Understandable.  </s>
<s> From our discussion I think this would be accepted by everyone on the Teleconf call too.  </s>
<s> But let me know if you think the parenthetical needs to stay.  </s>
<s> THIS IS POSTED TO THE LIST FOR COMMMENT PRIOR TO ACTION If there are no objections (or better ideas) I will proceed to change them in the Draft.  </s>

<s> Hi, I too prefer perceptible, although I think it is a question of language style rather than different meanings.  </s>
<s> I am happy about dropping the "(including Orientation)" - that should be an obvious part of navigable.  </s>
<s> I don't think technology robust means anything.  </s>
<s> I had to look up where it was being used to get any clue at all.  </s>
<s> Robust on its own is slightly more obvious, but I hope another word could be found at some point.  </s>

<s> Since "Technology Robust" just leaves people scratching their heads --  </s>
<s> how about we just go with ROBUST for now -- and use the full title to describe what type of ROBUST we mean.  </s>
<s> (maybe we will find other types of Robustness we want to put in there anyway.  </s>
<s> That also gives us a complete set of one word items Anyone with any other ideas, keep posting them.  </s>
