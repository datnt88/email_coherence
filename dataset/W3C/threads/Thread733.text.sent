I downloaded "the latest version" of Tidy which is supposed to be 04 August 2000 however when I run the program it says "vers 30 April 2000". 
Anyone else experience this? 
Al Marote I sent a note to Dave Raggett early this month about this issue, at least with regard to the Windows version. 
I gather that he hasn't had a chance to fix it. 
For the Windows version, downloading the source from: ...will get you the current executable as well. 
-- Dave Sorry about that. 
I fixed this and all should now be well. 
I expect to make the next release in March.

I downloaded the Windoze version of Tidy from as "tidy -v" I got the following message: "HTML Tidy release date: 30th April 2000" I'm a bit confused... per Dave Raggett's reply below, was this already to have been updated, or will it be updated in March? 
I haven't downloaded the source code: up-to-date (novice = scared by compiling) but I did notice that TIDY. 
If someone replies to the list, I would appreciate if you could send a copy to my email address below. 
May I take this opportunity to say express my gratitude for an html-tidier world?

The link you cited is supposed to point at the latest (4 August 2000) version of HTML Tidy, but I see that it still references the 30 April 2000 version. 
Dave? 
You don't need to compile it. 
The ZIP file contains not only the source code but also the Tidy executable (i.e., TIDY.EXE). 
Just extract that one file from the archive after downloading (or unpack the entire ZIP file into a directory, move the TIDY.EXE file out to another location, and delete the rest of the files). 
-- Dave I thought I had fixed that months ago. 
Sorry. 
I have just uploaded the 4th August tidy.exe 
file and once the W3C mirrors have been updated all should be well. 
I am working on a new release which I plan to post in March. 
This will add a number of new features, as well as bug fixes.

I've been using TidyGUI. 
How soon after there is an update to Tidy does TidyGUI get updated? 
Or is TidyGUI set up to use whatever version of Tidy happens to be installed? 
Hello Howard, in my experience, Andr? 
usually updates his TidyGUI within two weeks of a new Tidy release, if not faster. 
Besides that, he posts a notification to this list when it is done.
