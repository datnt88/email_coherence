<s> From the current state of affairs, the web is based on URIs.  </s>
<s> From what I see, this is unlikely to change and I'm cool with this, expecially because URIs that are general enough to indicate anything, even concepts that are not "locatable".  </s>
<s> What do you mean by, "not locatable"?  </s>
<s> There are things, like abstract concepts, which may not be objects you find on the web, but they are things which one describe.  </s>
<s> Then, please, tell me: if these concepts are not locatable, why are we supposed to use the HTTP protocol to indicate them?  </s>
<s> I know, I know: in order to keep them unique using the domain name facilities... but ask yourself why in hell a namespace URI such as  </s>
<s> The XSLT namespace is in fact An engineer who comes across a document which uses that namespace can look it up, and get information leading him or her to the XSTL specification.  </s>
<s> This is useful.  </s>
<s> So while a namespace seems like an abstract concept, to actually refer to it by the name of something which can be looked up is variable.  </s>
<s> In the semantic web, information can be used not only be a person, but by a machine.  </s>
<s> So while the concept  </s>
<s> of "two-digit US state code" may be a an abstract property, in fact one can find the list of them and the correlation with various other properties.  </s>
<s> This is powerful.  </s>
<s> is not uri://w3.org/xslt/1.0  </s>
<s> where: 1) there is no misleading since the protocol clearly indicate its "unlocatable" status  </s>
<s> You presumably mean that no one should ever look up what the owner of the name said about it.  </s>
<s> You need the "urn:" prefix not "uri:".  </s>
<s> But betware that many urn: subschemes are actually less useful because they are waiting for some sort of lookup mechanism, and to the extent they have such a mechanism, they become just clumsier versions of http:  </s>
<s> 2) the domain-based uniqueness is maintained, no, improved, given that virtualhosts are not considered meaningful (there is no location taking place, just unique identification)  </s>
<s> The difference is an attitude of mind, and a mode of use.  </s>
<s> Think of what you would like from your "uri:" space above, and use http: space like that.  </s>
<s> Use them like names not like locations.  </s>
<s> They are not locations.  </s>
<s> 3) version numbers are used instead of years.  </s>
<s> this makes them much easier to remember (you remember the version of the namespace you want to associate your content with, not the year that version was published [unless the year *is* the version, like in win95/98/2000/2003, but it's not the case here])  </s>
<s> That is a question of web site management.  </s>
<s> The advantage of years is that in 100 years time, when someone wants to reuse they string "xslt", they will not have a problem.  </s>
<s> Please, tell me why this hasn't been since day one, because I'm going crazy on this.  </s>
<s> Think of them as names.  </s>

<s> Ok, I found it :) by a little human googeling around.  </s>
<s> But I doubt that a machine could have found it, based on the information returned from that URI. :( It's just so very dissappointing that even the W3C has not seen fit to provide a standard path from a namespace URI to a normative specification document - if for no other purpose than just to show them to humans.  </s>

<s> Googeling?  </s>
<s> If I click on the namespace URI, I get a page saying """This is an XML namespace defined in the XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0 specification.  </s>

<s> For a *human* user, that's pretty direct, isn't it?  </s>
