In FAQ I read next: Requesting Password-protected Web/FTP sites User authentication support for password-protected sites is also available by www4mail. 
To access such Web site/pages conforming to the pattern `protocol://username:password@site/directory' you need to know (and then pass on) the correct USERNAME and PASSWORD. 
In these cases send an e-mail Subject: (... whatever you like) and write in the body of the e-mail: or ftp://username:password@site/path where site/path is the machine,domain,directory,file you want to retrieve and the @-sign is used to separate the string `username:password' from the site/path. 
I use next line mypassword@ccnow.com/login/" 
http://mylogin:mypassword@ccnow.com/login/ and mypassword@www.amexmail.com/" 
http://mylogin:mypassword@www.amexmail.com/ 
but I get page www.ccnow.com/login/ and www.amexmail.com 
- not into my account. 
Why? 
Best wishes Michael Try using the www4mail server in the USA: www4mail@collaborium.org Enrique I get page E. Canessa, Ph.D The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics - ICTP; P.O.Box 586 - 34100 Trieste, Italy PGP Public Key at: www.ictp.trieste.it/~canessae

I will suggest also that you try your request with www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it 
and let me know if the problem exists with this server so, I can fix it. 
Thanks Clement Onime ut I get page
