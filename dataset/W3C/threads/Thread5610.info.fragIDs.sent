<s> RDF data is often presented visually.  </s>
<s> For simple cases, node-and-arc diagrams (things connected to other things) are often used, with some automatic layout for managing the number of connections to any particular node.  </s>
<s> Understanding the information presented depends on several factors.  </s>
<s> For example foafnaut - http://foafnaut.org - presents a person with some data about them, a picture of them, and information about how many people they know or are known by, or for how many people there are photos of them together available.  </s>
<s> For generic RDF data (i.e. where the information recorded isn't known in advance) it is more difficult to determine what connections are interesting.  </s>
<s> Being able to select among those available is valuable.  </s>
<s> Being able to merge or de-merge connections which are subtypes of each other is a useful strategy for dealing with large amounts of granular information.  </s>
<s> This is something that is often not represented explicitly in current systems, either visually or otherwise.  </s>
<s> there is a SWAD-E workpackage on visualisation and accessibility - so far we have produced some preliminary ideas: well as the image annotation workshop which explored some ideas in this area: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dev_workshop_report_1/ (sorry these are such rough thoughts.  </s>
<s> I thought it was better to get them out than polish them in private, since other people may know this already or be happy to find the pointers...) cheers Chaals  </s>
