<s> I noticed, while briefly trying out MS Internet Explorer 4, that their browser has a problem accessing Sprynet and Compuserve sites.  </s>
<s> It appears that those servers don't know what to do with HTTP 1.1 requests, and all that comes back is an error that the server didn't know what to do with the request.  </s>
<s> A good example is my own pages (or rather my SF club) at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/James_E_LaBarre/SFABC.htm.  </s>
<s> Everyone who has tried this with MSIE4 has a problem, but all other browsers work.  </s>
<s> Could someone try it with Amaya, as that *also* is using HTTP 1.1?  </s>

<s> If there's a timeout, the client knows it's talking to an HTTP/1.0 server.  </s>
<s> The Sprynet server does not give the client a chance.  </s>

<s> I was wondering, though, if Amaya definitely fails.  </s>
<s> If multiple browsers fail, we can pressure Spry to do something about it sooner, rather than giving their arrogant "oh, we don't support betas" reply.  </s>

<s> James, I don't know about pressure, but Amaya does fail too.  </s>
<s> The server does not give an HTTP/1.1 browser an opportunity to fall back to HTTP/1.0 without closing the connection.  </s>
<s> All in all, Amaya is also in beta status!  </s>
<s> -Jose  </s>
<s> Sure, Amaya is beta too, but it emphasizes that Spry needs to fix their server software, because likely *all* new browsers will have problems with their servers, which means their customers may start leaving for other providers, etc.  </s>
<s> Not good for long term income prospects g .  </s>
