A quick reply to one of pat's questions and then a list of review comments. 
?? Can you say why XML Schema is nonmonotonic?? 
default attributes in the syntax 
I mark my comments as "MUST" "PREFER" "EDIT" to indicate my level of commitment to them. 
Status These include requirements that... 
The RDF Core group must take into account the various formalizations of RDF that have been proposed since the publication of the RDF Model and Syntax 
Recommendation. 
The group is encouraged to make use both of formal techniques and implementation-led test cases throughout their work. 
The RDF schema system must provide an extensibility mechanism to allow future work (for example on Web Ontology and logic-based Rule languages) to provide richer facilities. 
This document addresses these two requirements. 
It does not present an RDF Core WG design for Semantic Web layering. 
Rather, it documents a technique we are exploring to describe the semantics of the RDF Core specifications. 
The RDF Core WG solicit feedback from other Working Groups and from the RDF implementor community on the wider applicability of this technique. 
MUST: replace "This document address these two requirements." 
with 

These two requirements are primarily addressed by the RDF Model Theory (ref) and the RDF Test Cases (ref). 
This document describes an alternative complimentry approach. 
PREFER: (cf: Peter's comments) add to Status 

This is a first draft which does not include any treatment of the semantics of any particular SWEL. 
A second draft will show how OWL can be layered on OWL within the lBase framework. 
2.0 Outline PREFER/MUST: replace: all currently proposed web langauges with 

most features of languages such as RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL and OWL (note owl:imports cannot be handled by lBase). 
EDIT: raison d'?tre sp: the accent should be circumflex, personally I would use lower case e. 2.1 Names and variables EDIT: I found the level of detail on the syntax of strings and names surprising; and somewhat lobsided. 
I know how to write whitespace in lBase but (without any examples or a formal EBNF grammar) don't feel that I know how to write any actual stuff. 
EDIT: I think you could omit all reference to XML structures with no loss. 
EDIT: I think a section clarifying precisely what can be done with special names may be useful. 
I would like to give me useful definitional text. 
EDIT: do special names correspond to dark triples? 
do the authors believe that this functionality is useful or confusing? 
I don't think the dark triple escapade contributed much to either WG. 2.2 Lbase Syntax EDIT: R(t1,...tn) where R is a relation name ? 
insert 

, a special name 2.4 Axiom schemes I like it. 
(I am sorry that damns the rest with faint praise, but I guess I am being pretty upfront about not supporting lbase). 
3.0 Using Lbase PREFER: This section really could do with an extended example, but I can wait til the next version. 
4.0 Inadequacies PREFER: I get the impression that the current doc was shooting at where the WG was in June. 
Since then we have progressed with datatyping, and I think coming clean about this in this section may be appropriate. 
e.g. 

This document was primarily based on and early drafts of As these drafts are revised, this document will need to be updated. 
In particular this document does not addequately address datatypes. 
Sorry to be a party pooper.

?? Can you say why XML Schema is nonmonotonic?? 
Is this at all meaningful? 
Absent some notion of entailment or inference, which I don't see in XML schema, I'm not sure what it means to be monotonic.

I wrote the status section. 
Per http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0256.html 
I propose a simpler change: s/This document addresses these two requirements./ 
This document is motivated by these two requirements./ 
Does that satisfy your concern?

Dan: 
Sorry I missed that ... That's certainly an improvement in the status. 
I am convinced that the Model Theory needs to be in the references, and mentioned in the introduction, and an acknowledgement that using model theories as the basis for layering, while not unproblematic has not been disastrous. 
In my view, those requirements are fully addressed by the MT and Test Cases. 
This document legitimately takes another view of the same requirements. 
But it should not diminish the value of our REC track docs. 
A possible change which would clarify that, would be section 1. 
e.g. 
Add 

Model theoretic semantics has already proved a useful tool for discussing and resolving issues related to layering in the semantic web. 
Specifically, the semantics of OWL [in preparation] is related to the semantics of RDF and RDFS [RDF MT], by model theoretic means. 
And then move on to the difficulties with this approach in section 2. 
Jeremy 
?? Can you say why XML Schema is nonmonotonic?? 
Perhaps not, but in that sense the lBase doc has then also excluded XML Schema from being a semantic web language, since (unless you buy some of pfps's contortions in Yin/Yang), it cannot be expressed as a logical language in the way that lBase requires. 
I think being less ambitious and more specific in scope is desirable. 
Jeremy 
I was not expecting XML schema to be regarded as a SWEL, at least not at the current state of play.

For RDF I would agree, For OWL and layering I think the case for Lbase is much stronger. 
But this fails to acknowledge the fact that for 9 months we were stuck trying to do it that way, that at least two papers were published claiming that it was impossible, and that the only way we managed to actually do it, finally, was by using a technique which (although I didn't emphasize this in the documents) was in fact based on an Lbase translation. 
I think that to say that the model theory has been useful as a way of *resolving* layering issues is really not accurate.

Me neither. 
We had RDF/RDFS/OIL/DAML/OWL/??? in mind. 
Perhaps I should make this clearer.

Sorry Pat I should have commented earlier - I am feeling much happier about the LBase doc on the basis that you are working on and will soon publish an LBase treatment of RDF. (I suspect I would prefer it as part of the note - but that's another issue). 
I think I have no more issues that must be addressed on that - in fact, with an LBase treatment of RDF I could positively support publication.
