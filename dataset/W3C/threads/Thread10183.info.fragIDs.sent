<s> Recommendation.  </s>
<s> The group is encouraged to make use both of formal techniques and implementation-led test cases throughout their work.  </s>
<s> The RDF schema system must provide an extensibility mechanism to allow future work (for example on Web Ontology and logic-based Rule languages) to provide richer facilities.  </s>
<s> This document addresses these two requirements.  </s>
<s> It does not present an RDF Core WG design for Semantic Web layering.  </s>
<s> Rather, it documents a technique we are exploring to describe the semantics of the RDF Core specifications.  </s>
<s> The RDF Core WG solicit feedback from other Working Groups and from the RDF implementor community on the wider applicability of this technique.  </s>

<s> This is a first draft which does not include any treatment of the semantics of any particular SWEL.  </s>
<s> A second draft will show how OWL can be layered on OWL within the lBase framework.  </s>

<s> EDIT: raison d'?tre sp: the accent should be circumflex, personally I would use lower case e. 2.1 Names and variables EDIT: I found the level of detail on the syntax of strings and names surprising; and somewhat lobsided.  </s>
<s> I know how to write whitespace in lBase but (without any examples or a formal EBNF grammar) don't feel that I know how to write any actual stuff.  </s>
<s> EDIT: I think you could omit all reference to XML structures with no loss.  </s>
<s> EDIT: I think a section clarifying precisely what can be done with special names may be useful.  </s>
<s> I would like to give me useful definitional text.  </s>
<s> EDIT: do special names correspond to dark triples?  </s>

<s> Absent some notion of entailment or inference, which I don't see in XML schema, I'm not sure what it means to be monotonic.  </s>

<s> Sorry I missed that ... That's certainly an improvement in the status.  </s>
<s> I am convinced that the Model Theory needs to be in the references, and mentioned in the introduction, and an acknowledgement that using model theories as the basis for layering, while not unproblematic has not been disastrous.  </s>
<s> In my view, those requirements are fully addressed by the MT and Test Cases.  </s>
<s> This document legitimately takes another view of the same requirements.  </s>
<s> But it should not diminish the value of our REC track docs.  </s>
<s> A possible change which would clarify that, would be section 1.  </s>

<s> Add  </s>

<s> Model theoretic semantics has already proved a useful tool for discussing and resolving issues related to layering in the semantic web.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the semantics of OWL [in preparation] is related to the semantics of RDF and RDFS [RDF MT], by model theoretic means.  </s>
<s> And then move on to the difficulties with this approach in section 2.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> ?? Can you say why XML Schema is nonmonotonic??  </s>
<s> Perhaps not, but in that sense the lBase doc has then also excluded XML Schema from being a semantic web language, since (unless you buy some of pfps's contortions in Yin/Yang), it cannot be expressed as a logical language in the way that lBase requires.  </s>
<s> I think being less ambitious and more specific in scope is desirable.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I was not expecting XML schema to be regarded as a SWEL, at least not at the current state of play.  </s>

<s> ?? Can you say why XML Schema is nonmonotonic??  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> For RDF I would agree, For OWL and layering I think the case for Lbase is much stronger.  </s>
<s> But this fails to acknowledge the fact that for 9 months we were stuck trying to do it that way, that at least two papers were published claiming that it was impossible, and that the only way we managed to actually do it, finally, was by using a technique which (although I didn't emphasize this in the documents) was in fact based on an Lbase translation.  </s>
<s> I think that to say that the model theory has been useful as a way of *resolving* layering issues is really not accurate.  </s>

<s> Sorry Pat I should have commented earlier - I am feeling much happier about the LBase doc on the basis that you are working on and will soon publish an LBase treatment of RDF. (I suspect I would prefer it as part of the note - but that's another issue).  </s>
<s> I think I have no more issues that must be addressed on that - in fact, with an LBase treatment of RDF I could positively support publication.  </s>
