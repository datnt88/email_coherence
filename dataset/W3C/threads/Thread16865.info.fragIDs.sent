<s> Well, we need both.  </s>
<s> The "escape out" is not the same as the "skip to".  </s>
<s> The "escape out" only allows one to get out of the current structure while the "skip to" doesn't rely on any structure nor on what is between your current location and the target.  </s>
<s> For example, a local link "skip to main content" allows one to efficiently skip over navigation links, nested navigation links, advertisement, and lots of other structures that the designer may choose to elegantly design (cram) into the top and side real estate of the site pages.  </s>
<s> The escape only allows one to escape out of the current structure.  </s>
<s> If the structures in the top and side navigation are nested, which they are often, one will be "escaping out" a few times before ever getting to the top of the main content.  </s>
<s> The "escape out" is a browser, or more important;y, as assistive technology responsibility.  </s>
<s> IBM Home Page Reader (and other screen readers) today allow one to escape to the next item, escape out to the bottom of a map, list, table, and other structures such as select menus.  </s>

<s> There are a couple of points I would make.  </s>
<s> Dave is right that in general good structure already identifies the content - not so much by saying "this is the start of the main content" but by identifying all the things that are not main content - navigation bars, etc.  </s>
<s> These can then be skipped over or escaped from by the user according to their preference.  </s>
<s> In a lot of cases "the main content" is what is left.  </s>
<s> The first time you encounter a site it can be helpful to find out what is in the navigation bar.  </s>
<s> And when you are navigating a way through a site you have more or less understood you need to use the navigation bar in the most useful sized chunks available.  </s>
<s> But if you get halfway into a long list of links (say the A-Z list oln the W3C home page and realise it isn't the particular navigation chunk you were looking for (perhaps you wanted the "participate" group that is later in the page) it is helpful to be able to find it.  </s>
<s> In HTML almost any element can take a title attribute.  </s>
<s> Using this, combined with good page structure, should make it easy to have a map of the page that corresponds to the map of the site, at a higher level of detail that the rough map you get from header elements.  </s>
<s> For most HTML this should be enough.  </s>
<s> For something like SVG or SMIL it might be a bit more complicated, but the same principles (and even the same attribute names) apply.  </s>
<s> So an XSLT that builds the tree of elements with a title should be pretty straightforward for a given language (admittedly in SVG you look for a title element as compared to an attribute in SMIl or HTML).  </s>
