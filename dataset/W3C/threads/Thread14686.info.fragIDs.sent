[A PF matter, with great relevance to GL issues.] 
In the XML Accessibility Guidelines (XML GL) currently, we have the following guideline and checkpoint:- Guideline 1 Ensure that authors can associate multiple media objects as alternatives 1.1 Make sure this is done in the most natural way possible [ignore the @@ and the priority]. 
]]] - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/gl-20010422 
At the moment, PF is undertaking to edit this guideline from its current obfuscated form into something with a little more impact. 
In doing so, we have found that it overlaps with some issues that GL have necessarily appropriated to themselves. 
In our case, we have the guideline "Ensure that authors can associate multiple media objects as alternatives" ... what we are saying is that as far as the schemata for data-oriented applications (see the document for a definition) are concerned, we want to enforce the ability to tie in some repurposable equivalent alternative with some content who's semantics may not be repurposable. 
Typically, this is represented by the age old "alt" text example in 
XHTML, viz.:- 
However, this can clearly no longer be taken as an acceptable example by itself, because it's a subsumption of the complexity of relationships that occur between content of different modalities. 
Thus, what I (we) are asking is for rationalization of the above where appropriate (e.g. in guidelines) - the fact that it's a subsumption should (at least) always be noted, and preferably) be expanded upon. 
For an example of what we want to achieve, let's take the XHTML "problem" again. 
What the alt text example says is that textual alternatives must be provided as an annotation for the image... in other words, we are thinking in terms of "I have an image, and now I have to provide some equivalent alternative in the form of an alt attribute". 
It is quite possible, and in fact often required for some content authors to annotate a concept, a run of text, or marked up content with an image. 
This isn't possible in XHTML 1.0/1.1/m12n 
(which is a great shame), but should be in 2.0, so for example:- The starving babies were in a desperate state. 
could become:- illust src="babies.gif" 
The starving babies were in a desperate state /illust Note that this is not simply limited to illustrations - the ability to associate a variety of media alternatives no matter what the modality should be pervasive throughout all XML data-oriented applications. 
The question thereafter becomes about UI: how do we associate the run to the image, where do we put that image, what do we do with the image? 
That's beyond the scope of XML GL (although may be in the scope of GL), but it could be that using some remote styling mechanism, one can explicitly style where they want the content to appear, and exactly how it should be styled. 
cf. 2.1 in XML GL. 
There's also the question of multiple illustrations for one run of text... note how much more interesting it becomes when (for example) you add the images to the text rather than the text to the images. 
So that's one small aspect of what we mean by natural. 
Another is the question of what we mean by repurposable images themselves, for example SVG. 
One view of the relationship here is that SVG enables people to export bits of semantics from the image itself. 
Others may prefer to think of it as the old annotation fashion again, i.e. adding the descriptions to the image as a secondary effect. 
This is not something that languages constrain upon people - it allows us to choose, which is correct. 
Hence, a "technique" for what we mean by "natural association" is a mixture of both not being constrained by current technologies as to the choice of semantic association mechanisms (and hence removing restrictions on the form of the language itself, and removing accessibility barriers). 
As for checkpoint 1.1 (soon to be 1.3 due to document reorganization) itself, I propose that WAI PF change the text to the following:- 1.3 Provide unconstrained mechanisms for semantically associating content of different modalities with one another. 
That is to say, if the semantics of part of a document instance are unlikely to be accessible to all of your readers, provide equivalent alternatives which facilitate understanding by other means. 
(Note that I'm using a modified earlier proposal for the explanatory text from Dave Pawson after the "-", which I found excellent).

Sean, After a couple of reads, and a jump to the site to find out what PF was, 
I'm still not sure what you are doing. 
I understand that "repurposable 
content" is fancy talk for "text" ... (Is there any other kind of 
repurposable content that could be included?) 
If I understand correctly, your starving babies example, under the current 
situation would be: 
IMG SRC="babies.gif" ALT="The starving babies were in desperite condition." 
which you would change to ILLUS SRC="babies.gif" 
The starving babies were in desperate condition. 
/ILLUS 
Unfortunately, I'm not seeing that this is an improvement. 
What am I missing?

So you're saying that I *shouldn't* go for the plain English award? 
Well, not necessarily - we don't currently make the distinction over what is repusposable and what is not, because that's a philisophical rat-hole; I try to stay as far away from it as possible. 
I think that enough people have a feel for what "repurposable" means from everyday context (remember, XML GL is targeted at XML application/tagset designers)... and if not, they can always look it up in the glossary, no? Hmph, maybe we do need to define "repurposable" somewhere... How about: "content that can be adpated for more than one 'purpose' - e.g. output modalities, processing formats". 
So much for staying "as far away from it as possible". 
Credit to William... 
That's one way of looking at it, but again, it falls short of the problem that (to quote myself), "it's a subsumption of the complexity of relationships that occur between content of different modalities". 
In other words, it's just an example of a reversal in techniques - not good normative example for a guideline without an explanation of scope. 
What we're really asking is that people aren't constrained to one method or t'other. 
The second method has its advantages by the way:- 1) Markup can be included in between tags, but not as attribute data. 
2) Multiple illustrations can easily be associated with a single run of text (somthing would needed to be said about the importance of nesting). 
3) You can provide ilustrations for subsections of larger models, and possibly use this to provide some sort of navigation mechanism at the same time (being careful not to overload the semantics of the elements involved - add it as attribute data or whatever). 
BTW, your "add images to text rather than text to images" was a big part in coming up with this; cheers.

Yep, some RDF could be repurposable content - it can be represented as an SVG image, or as text, or as a 3-d navigation sequence, or... (An SVG image can include RDF, to make the picture bit look cooler to start with) If I was more awake I think I could come up with other examples.

Does anyone know a way to fine tune left click interpretation? 
problem: left click is used to drag and to trigger link. 
We use ie5 and have set up for single click. 
some users move icons due to 'shaking' 
ie5 seems to be set up so a 1 pixel move is a move not a click (reasonable for repositioning) else it triggers a link. 
I'm creating a dhtml site and want to maintain consisitency with OS, and have some fine tuning. 
aka having ones cake and eating it. 
thanks jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com 
AG:: For users subject to shaking, have you tried them with a trackball? 
Al 
Have used trackball, looking for software approach for dhtml ie is it a recognised standard across graphical browsers that a left click followed by a pixel move indicates drag whereas a mouseup without pixel move equals a link. 
basically I've yet to find a dhtml program that drags objects that are links to external content. 
It looks like I might have to write this 'from scratch', and I'd like to start from the right premise. 
short code sample: z-index:1; left: 75px; top: 250px" this is draggable, however if I add: z-index:1; left: 75px; top: 250px" it now is not draggable but does have a working link. 
probably this is due to my capturing events incorrectly, and I'm looking into a workaround. 
I still have to figure out how to differentiate, and time could be an option ie quick = link. 
do we have any info on this... jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com 
full code as it stands about 30 lines total for draggable links here: the link aspect is not working yet.... comments welcome jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com
