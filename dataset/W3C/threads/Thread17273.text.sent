The title gets your attention, huh? 
I cannot believe that I missed his column from mid-July: I don't mean to stir up another raging debate on PDFs but do wish to get to the bottom on the usability/accessibility issues of this format for web presentation, as I have seen more problemmatic PDFs than I care to think of. 
Yet, everyone wants to PDF for the web. 
Nielson is clear in stating an opinion; "PDF is great for one thing and one thing only: printing documents. 
Paper is superior to computer screens in many ways, and users often prefer to print documents that are too long to easily read online." 
"For online reading, however, PDF is the monster from the Black Lagoon. 
It puts its clammy hands all over people with a cruel grip that doesn't let go." 
Is anyone willing to agree or disagree with this stance? 
Can anyone, as users, report definite problems with rendering PDF files? 
Thanks! Bill Williams Thank goodness for that! 
It needed to be said by someone who gets listened to on usability. 
I find it a constant problem, for the simple reason that it's grossly inflexible. 
I usually need to increase the text size, but even without that a PDF viewer needs an uncomfortably wide window that precludes having anything else of meaningful size visible. 
At best it hogs the desktop - and gives me a headache after the first two or three pages. 
That's more a usability than an accessibility issue, though.

Dear All, There are multiple issues with PDF that have been stated over and over again. 
While I applaud the efforts to make PDF accessible, there are problems that are extremely difficult to overcome. 
1. 
Many times images are used in the PDF to present textual content. 
This is not rendered to the end user who is blind, and so we are missing that information. 
This is not acceptable. 
2. The order of reading is extremely important. 
For example, a "Poison Warning" (with a skull and crossbones image - even if there is also text) is not guaranteed to be presented to the user who is blind prior to the dangerous action described in the associated paragraph. 
This order of reading may not be an issue with flat page layout, but complex pages frequently suffer from this disorder of rendering. 
Of course, this is due to the fact that visual perception can take in a whole page (screen), while the person who is using synthetic speech is presented the information in a linear fashion. 
3. Having the PDF page go through a translation means that the user who is blind is never certain that all the information has been converted or converted properly. 
I guess this is a result of the above two points, but confidence in the information source is important to me.

On Behalf Of Nick Kew Sent: Saturday, August 23, 2003 11:17 AM Subject: Re: Jakob Nielsen Column -- PDF: Unfit for Human Consumption (chop specific points) It seems to me that your points apply to HTML as much as to PDF, which would seem to be an argument in favour of it (since arguments against PDF as a Web format hinge on it presenting more problems than HTML). 
Are you saying it's inherently worse than HTML for blind users, even setting aside the additional cost of equipment capable of reading PDF? 
Or merely that it's often problematic in practice? 
My point concerned usability for sighted users!

I swore I wasn't going tto get drawn into this again PDF is not accessible for a broad range of people, again I emphsis this is a WORLD Wide Web and just because folks in the more developed counties are running the latest and greatest does not mean that is the case in the rest of the world, in many countries linking to the web is based on time, and the longer your on the more it costs, and if you are on a dirty telephone line at 2400baud you don't want pretty you want accurate and fast..LYNX or PINE are the solutions of choice, and I have yet to see either of these do anything with pdf except choke. 
and if it is a doctor in remote Nicaragua who needs some help with a diagnosis pdf isn't going to save a life...!

They are intended ONLY for the individual or entity named Hello, Nick asks: "Are you saying it's inherently worse than HTML for blind users, even setting aside the additional cost of equipment capable of reading PDF?" I am saying that PDF is inherently difficult to transform properly, and I stated my three issues. 
I was not talking about HTML or XML, but if produced according to the WAI guidelines, HTML is great.

Subject: RE: Jakob Nielsen Column -- PDF: Unfit for Human Consumption The conclusion you reach is the same conclusion I reached when digging around at the time this article surfaced. 
To be fair, the source of the accessibility limitations came from Adobe's own website - which is somewhat a good thing they realise the limitations of their format. 
My blog entry on this is http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/access/AccessibilityOfPdfs and contains links for both sides of the argument, most notably http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1161 . 
The inescapable conclusion (IMO) is that if the PDF is simple, then it is possible to make it accessible. 
Complex layouts and complex tables in PDFs aren't accessible. 
Thanks for the additional info.
