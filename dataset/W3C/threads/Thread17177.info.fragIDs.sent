Hi 
Can anyone tell me if Assitive Technologies are able to read PDF 
documents? 
More and more "offline" content is being held on web sites 
in this format, so it would be nice to think that it is actually accessible... Cheers M

that's a less than useful answer in that it doesn't really give a true picture of the situation. 
Yes, it's true that AT cannot read pdf documents created using Acrobat 4 but (correct me if I'm wrong) it *is* possible using 
version 5 to produce documents that are accessible if the creator knows what they're doing. 
We are now in a situation where pdf holds similar ground to 
html in that unless the developer knows what they're doing the resulting documents will be inaccessible to some extent. 
Given that people will still continue to use pdf shouldn't we be giving a more upbeat message about how to create accessible versions otherwise we're going to be stuck with documents that theoretically can be made accessible but aren't because the creators don't know that it can be done. 
This is an *interest* group and to my mind that means exploring possibilities and trying to produce solutions. 
Or am I yet another who has seriously misjudged the remit of the list?

That's not really true. 
A design aim of PDF was that you could extract text from it. 
Some authoring tools abuse it in a way that makes this difficult (and the original machine readable source has to be text). 
Also, PDF has what is now calls digital rights management in mind, and provides ways of instructing the browser not to let you access the machine readable text. 
This latter point could be seen as a weakness in HTML and SVG, that may discourage its use where intellectual property is a big issue. 
Version 5 adds a feature to allow deep structure to be represented, but most HTML pages don't have deep structure correctly represented!
