<s> I'm relatively new to the list, so I apologize if this has already made the rounds...  </s>
<s> Basically I'm wonding how binary objects are to be handled in the DOM.  </s>
<s> Was any consideration given to including a Binary interface derived from Node in Level 1?  </s>
<s> As you can guess, I am concerned that any BLOB that I wanted to store in the object model will double in size (unnecessarily) in a Text or CDATASection node.  </s>
<s> It seems like a Binary node would make sense in the XML level if not in the core, but perhaps people feel this extension belongs at a level that supports data-typing.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ted  </s>
<s> This was discussed in Malbourne as part of the discussion about NDATA entities (the only way to get binary data in XML).  </s>
<s> I noted that we probably need to provide some interface for directly accessing the binary data, and I think most people agreed in principal.  </s>
<s> Expect to see something in the next spec.  </s>
<s> I will be revising the stuff on entities, and will take care of this then.  </s>
<s> I would also like to mention that two other developers and I are close to finishing up a proposal for embedding binary data in XML which does not use NDATA.  </s>
<s> We will be addressing the DOM related issues as well once we are done.  </s>
<s> We are just haggling over the proposal name (the effort started off as XML-Binary but the proposal now covers more than just binary data so we are trying to come up with more reasonable name).  </s>
<s> Don't worry.  </s>
<s> We have our eyes on the ball.  </s>
<s> I just wish I knew where the heck I am ;-).  </s>
<s> Regards, Don Park  </s>
<s> The DOM that we're doing has as requirements XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> Future versions would be nice, but I hope we can get something stable at some stage.  </s>
<s> Which might mean that we need to say "that's good; we'll have to add it later".  </s>
