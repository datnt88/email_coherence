I've been floundering in the "distance education" milieu and have become alarmed at all the diverse approaches to the overall problem. 
I wonder if "authoring tools" might be considered to include tools used to "author" distance learning projects? 
This is becoming a huge field too rapidly to really keep a grip on and there are already several associations that seek to be the standard setters for the field. 
A search on "distance learning" got me too many to deal with! 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Where distance education is provided by the web, the tools used to author content for that service are within our current scope. 
The tools used to pass stuff around are in some cases user agents, and therefore are in the scope of the user agent group. 
(examples would include soft-arc's first class client, the only one I have used much) Often these systems are in fact authoring tools and user agents combined, although generally limited in their power. 
There are also servers which don't have any real effect on the content. 
They don't fall into the scope of any WAI group as such.
