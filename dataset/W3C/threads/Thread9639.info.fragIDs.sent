<s> Brian asked me (for the Xth time, sigh) to express my concerns about reification in writing.  </s>
<s> My position remains that we need an interoperable and efficient way of doing reification.  </s>
<s> If we go for "stating" (answer "No" to Q1 in [1]), no special semantics is associated with the vocabulary rdf:Statement, rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object.  </s>
<s> This means applications *cannot interoperate* using this vocabulary since its meaning is unspecified.  </s>
<s> Effectively, going for "stating" amounts to deprecating 4-triple reification as used today.  </s>
<s> If we go for "statement" (answer "Yes" to Q1 in [1]), we get a (rather painful, admittedly, but endorsed) way of referring to statements found on Web pages and in RDF databases, recording provenance etc.  </s>
<s> This is IMO much more concrete and useful that just providing no definition at all, although the usability of 4-triple reification still remains seriosly hampered by its verbosity.  </s>
<s> In summary, if we go for "stating" we have *no* official mechanism for reification.  </s>
<s> In this case we'd have to suggest an alternative, we cannot just wash our hands.  </s>
<s> It is an illusion that we can leave the vocabulary undefined and at the same time recommend developers to use it in a consistent way.  </s>
<s> If we go for "statement" we do have a solution, albeit a poor one.  </s>
<s> If we run out of time in finding an alternative *efficient* way of doing reification, we could of course fall back on "statement" expressed using 4 triples.  </s>
<s> In this case, we would not have achieved much since inefficiency proved to be a show stopper for using 4-triple reification in the past 3 years.  </s>

<s> Although many of the points that are going to be made in the ensuing thread on this will have been made before (maybe even X times!), perhaps we have a different perspective on some of them this time around.  </s>
<s> Anyway, let me take a crack (hoping I'm not going to restate some heresy we've already recanted...)  </s>
<s> I agree with the last sentence.  </s>
<s> The problem is that I don't believe this is exactly right.  </s>
<s> There are a number of things involved here.  </s>
<s> And verbosity isn't the main issue.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The things found on Web pages and in RDF databases are *instances* of statements, otherwise known (?) as "statings".  </s>
<s> When I express provenance (at least a lot of the time), I want to talk about a particular instance in a particular place, not the single abstract thing determined by a given (subject, predicate, object) triple.  </s>
<s> I must, for example, be able to say "fred wrote s,p,o at location X, at time T1", and "mary wrote s,p,o at location Y, at time T2" and have those be distinct things, and not thereby intermingle X, Y, T1, and T2.  </s>
<s> For example, does: stmt1 rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>
<s> stmt1 rdf:subject aSubject .  </s>
<s> stmt1 rdf:predicate aPredicate .  </s>
<s> stmt1 rdf:object anObject .  </s>
<s> stmt1 ex:writtenby fred .  </s>
<s> stmt1 ex:atTime T1 .  </s>
<s> stmt2 rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>
<s> stmt2 rdf:subject aSubject .  </s>
<s> stmt2 rdf:predicate aPredicate .  </s>
<s> stmt2 rdf:object anObject .  </s>
<s> stmt2 ex:writtenby mary .  </s>
<s> stmt2 ex:atTime T2 .  </s>
<s> entail: stmt2 ex:writtenby fred .  </s>
<s> stmt2 ex:atTime T1 .  </s>
<s> I think the answer has to be "NO" if you want provenance in general to work, because otherwise you can't even suggest that there are two different instances involved.  </s>
<s> [Depending on what you read into the fact that there are separate stmt1 and stmt2 ]. 2. In the example above, stmt1 and stmt2 were newly-minted URIs defined as part of the process of reifying the two original occurrences of what fred and mary said.  </s>
<s> That is, in the M&amp;S reification examples, it's assumed that you can't directly identify the statement you want to express provenance information about; instead you have to create a new URI, and then use the reification vocabulary to describe the subject, predicate, etc. of that new entity.  </s>
<s> The thing is, that: a.  </s>
<s> The best you can do with the reification vocabulary, as it is, is to express provenance information about some reification (triple quad) which you effectively claim describes (has the same subject, predicate, and object as) some actual statement occurrence that the provenance is *really* about.  </s>
<s> However, there is no way in the current reification mechanism to directly establish the relationship between the quad and the actual statement occurrence the provenance is really about.  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> If the original statings each had a URI, no reification syntax would be necessary to do provenance.  </s>
<s> That is, if the actual triple written by Fred had a URI, I could simply write: fredtriple ex:writtenby fred .  </s>
<s> fredtriple ex:atTime T1 .  </s>
<s> Note that for interoperability of provenance I need mutual understanding of the *provenance* vocabulary (e.g., ex:atTime ), not just the reification vocabulary.  </s>
<s> 3. It's not clear that you couldn't continue to use the current vocabulary with the general meaning suggested by (a).  </s>
<s> You'd just have to accept that you have to take a certain amount on faith (that the reification "description" is a suitable "stand in" for the actual triple that you're describing with it).  </s>
<s> I don't think it hurts to have a standard vocabulary (like the rdf:subject) for describing the "substructure" of statement occurrences.  </s>
<s> It's just that having that vocabulary doesn't get us all that far in dealing with provenance.  </s>
<s> I agree that we can't just wash our hands; too much has been made of "RDF reification".  </s>

<s> Hi Sergey,  </s>
<s> I'm sorry about the repeats.  </s>
<s> I see what you mean here, and I agree with it, though I think you express it a bit too forcefully.  </s>
<s> There was no model theory in M&amp;S at all, but folks seem to have managed to do useful things with it.  </s>
<s> Thus, even without model theoretic semantics, the reification vocabulary can be used, and provided you understand the semantics attached to it by a particular application, then you can do useful things with it.  </s>
<s> But I agree with you, that it defines no semantics that apply across the board to all applications.  </s>
<s> We have run out of time.  </s>
<s> However, there has been talk on this list of some folks getting together and proposing new vocabulary, possibly publishing as a note.  </s>
<s> That could be a way forward.  </s>
<s> There has been strong support in the WG for the position we have now  </s>
<s> reached.  </s>
<s> I have not officially closed the issue, though I plan to put it up for closure this week, if Frank agrees that is appropriate.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian, Sergey-- Let me to refer you to: (my earlier reply to Sergey's post) and to: (discussion with Ron Daniel about his provenance use case, and the value of having the reification vocabulary) I think that: a.  </s>
<s> There *is* value in having the vocabulary b.  </s>
<s> We can assign useful meaning to the terms in that vocabulary c.  </s>
<s> The vocabulary by itself doesn't do what you want "reification" to do for the uses described for it in the M&amp;S.  </s>
<s> I don't see how a decision for "statement" rather than "stating" changes all that much about the definition of the reification vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Even more, I don't see what good it does to be able to interoperate via this vocabulary if the use of that vocabulary doesn't allow you to express what you (presumably) want the applications to interoperate about.  </s>
<s> Is there some major use case other than provenance that we don't know about?  </s>
<s> Brian says:  </s>
<s> I think it's probably appropriate to ask if people think we've done enough or, at least, what else they think ought to be done to "declare victory".  </s>
<s> My own view (expressed in my message to Sergey) is that we can't just "wash our hands"; too much has been made of "RDF reification" in the past.  </s>
<s> That means we probably need to be more explicit about what our "revised position" is about reification, e.g., for guidance of any editor that needs to write about it.  </s>
<s> (In other words, here's an invitation for anyone who wants to "declare victory" to write the "victory declaration statement".)  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
<s> I think we have done enough.  </s>
<s> It doesn't amount to much as part of a formal definition of a language, but a big step for mankind by getting the issues clear.  </s>
<s> I think Brian is eminently qualified to write the victory statement, but I could have a shot at it.  </s>

<s> But you know, the same applies to containers.  </s>
<s> There really is no semantics to containers, in the sense that no extra semantic conditions need to be imposed on the RDFS container vocabulary in order to make sequence-based containers 'work' .  </s>
<s> But they do work, all the same, because they wear their relevant structure openly, expressed in RDF itself (and implicitly in the lexicographic ordering of the membership property names, in that case) .  </s>
<s> So one can have nontrivial content expressed in RDFS without imposing *extra* semantics on a vocabulary.  </s>
<s> As Ive often said, RDF is a pipsqueak of a language, but its not completely powerless to say things.  </s>
<s> No special semantics isn't quite the same as no semantics at all.  </s>
