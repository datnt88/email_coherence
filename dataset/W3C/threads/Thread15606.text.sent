During the Feb. 11 call, I took an action item to propose wording for Guideline 3.4. 
My goals were (1) to propose testable success criteria for consistent layout and predictable behavior of interactive components and (2) to propose Level 1 success criteria. 
In addition, (3) I wanted to continue my previous work on the "plain language" rewrite, which had gotten only as far as Guideline 3.3. 
I have not addressed the informative Benefits and Examples sections. 
The current wording from the February 14 internal working draft appears after the end of the proposed wording. 
Begin proposed wording for Guideline 3.4 3.4 Use layouts that are consistent and make interactive components act in predictable ways. 
Success criteria for Level 1 1. 
Components that are repeated on multiple pages, such as navigation bars and sections within the main content, occur in the same order in the source document for each page where they appear. 
2. Related links and form controls are placed in groups that can be identified by assistive technology. 
3. 
Any extreme change of context such as an automatic redirect or a link that opens a new browser window are implemented in a manner that can be recognized by assistive technology. 
Success criteria for Level 2 1. 
Components that appear visually on multiple pages, such as navigation bars, search forms, and sections within the main content, are displayed in the same location relative to other content on every page where they appear. 
2. Related links are grouped together visually, for example in navigation bars. 
3. Related form controls are grouped together visually, for example in visually distinct sections of a form. 
4. Link text (including alt text for graphical links) and/or graphic design clearly identifies the target of each link. 
5. Graphical components that appear on multiple pages, including graphical links, are associated with the same text equivalents wherever they appear. 
6. Interactive elements that appear on multiple pages, including graphical elements, are associated with the same functionality wherever they appear. 
7. Link text, including alt text for graphical links, includes words or phrases that occur in the title element of destination pages. 
8. Explicit notice is given in advance of any extreme change of context such as an automatic redirect or a link that opens a new browser window. 
9. Except for submit buttons, form controls, options within form controls, and menu items that are part of page content can be selected without causing submission of the form. 
Success Criteria for Level 3 1. 
When components such as navigation bars and search forms appear on multiple pages, users can choose to have those elements presented in a different visual position or reading-order. 
2. There are no extreme changes of context such as automatic redirects or automatically appearing pop-up windows. 
End proposed wording for Guideline 3.4 and Success Criteria for Levels 1-3.

[Y] Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "inconsistent" and "unpredictable" are not testable. 
( Untestable Success Criteria) 3. wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the following is true: [Y] List of 2 items nesting level 1 A. an easy to find setting, that persists for the site visit, is provided for the user to deactivate processes or features that cause extreme changes in context or B. extreme changes in context are identified before they occur so the user can determine if they wish to proceed or so they can be prepared for the change list end nesting level 1 Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): Might be able to make this testable if we come up with a better definition of "extreme changes in context" ( Untestable Success Criteria) list end Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.4 List of 2 items 1. [begin proposed] user can select a different location for navigation elements in the layout of the page. 
Issue #352] [Y] [end proposed] 2. the content has been reviewed, taking into account common ideas for making content consistent and predictable, applying them as appropriate. 
[Y] Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "has been reviewed" is only testable by someone internal to the development organization.

I'd like to propose a change to my proposed wording for the guideline itself. 
3.4 Organize page content in a consistent manner and make interactive components act in predictable ways. 
[This replaces the wording proposed in 3.4 Use layouts that are consistent and make interactive components act in predictable ways.] 
Rationale for the proposed change: I believe tehg uideline should address page-level organization rather than visual layout. 
Layout is a way of making organization visible (as well as a way of imposing organization), but the guideline should be capable of addressing the challenge of making organization availble to auditory and tactile experience.

MessageHello All, From: John M Slatin SP: - consistency is across pages and using "Page content" may be confusing. 
Also it may not be consistent throughout a site but across specific sections or applications. 
This should be recognized. 
- "Predictable ways" too can be termed ambiguous. 
Predictable by whom? 
- "layout" is an important term here and is necessary to be mentioned in the context of organizing content. 
- consistency applies to use of interactive components also, right? 
So here is a proposal: Rewording for the guideline 3.4: How about - Use a consistent layout for organizing content across the site / its specific sections - Ensure that interactive components behave consistently and in a manner defined for the component.

* Good points, Sailesh. 
Your message prompts me to think that consistency should occur at at least the following levels: 1. Across multiple pages within a single site or a single resource on large sites that contain multiple resources. 
2. Across multiple sections/resources on sites that contain multiple sections or resources. 
From the standpoint of our interests in both clarity and brevity, I think it would probably be best to incorporate wording like my #1 and #2 above into the Success Criteria rather than the wording of the actual guideline; I think this would also hold for scoping the consistency of interface element behavior. 
But perhaps others will agree that we should include these specifics in the guideline itself. 
I would prefer not to use wording such as "Use a consistent layout for organizing content..." The word "layout" refers to a concept that's primarily spatial and secondarily visual, and I wanted to get at something that is more "sense-neutral" and capable of being specified independently of the mode of presentation. 
If components are ordered consistently in the source document, they will be consistent for any user agent that relies on source-code order, while the display order may be quite different with user agents that support CSS positioning, etc. Thanks!
