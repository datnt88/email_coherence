<s> Hi I have a few problems with Amaya 2.4 and existing html.  </s>
<s> The following peice of code is confusing Amaya which then butchers it.  </s>
<s> IMG HEIGHT="16" WIDTH="12" SRC="/cgi-bin/general/counter.pl?from=books&amp;num=8&amp;roman=1"  </s>
<s> Amaya saves something resembling /cgi-bin/general/counter.pl which obviously doesn't work.  </s>
<s> Since much of our HTML is littered with dynamic images for various reasons, the editor has a very limited use on static only pages.  </s>
<s> As a side effect it also folds all html tags to lower case which is exceptionally annoying to those of use who prefer to develop HTML inside emacs.  </s>
<s> There does not appear to be anyway to override this.  </s>
<s> Cheers Luke Dobson Perl: the swiss-army chainsaw of computer languages.  </s>
<s> Regardless of what Amaya is doing with it, this is invalid and relies on browser error recovery for unknown entities.  </s>
<s> The correct version is:  </s>
<s> IMG HEIGHT="16" WIDTH="12" SRC="/cgi-bin/general/counter.pl?from=books&amp;amp;num=8&amp;amp;roman=1"  </s>
<s> Note that the HTML spec reccomends that CGI scripts which are likely to be used with simulated forms URLs should accept ; as equivalent to &amp; to avoid the need for replacing the &amp;s with entities.  </s>
<s> The output from forms submission appears to be without the &amp;amp; as is the output from Amaya.  </s>
<s> If I change the code to add the "&amp;amp;", Amaya removes it when it saves it and corrupts it the next time it opens it anyway!  </s>
<s> img height="16" width="12" src="/cgi-bin/general/counter.pl?from=books&amp;num=4&amp;roman=1"  </s>
<s> The scripts are okay with the ";".  </s>
<s> Amaya also seems to intermittently remove comments!.  </s>
<s> Its a pity as this seems to otherwise be a good HTML editor, its the first I've played with that I've not given up with after five minutes.  </s>
<s> Cheers Luke Dobson Perl: the swiss-army chainsaw of computer languages.  </s>
<s> Same here -- it's the only one to keep my long term interest, but its bugs and general lack of polish make it unusable for serious HTML projects.  </s>
<s> I suppose that's what you get with a bleeding edge experimental program that's perpetually in beta... Give me a big documentation task, and I'll probably generate the results in the form of PDF or DVI files using TeX...  </s>
<s> However, I'm lurking here waiting for the bug reports, one day, to get down to a low roar... then I might install whatever version is current then and see how it drives...  </s>
<s> I think the problem is actually all the legacy spaghetti code with pointer tangles and type unsafety written in procedural languages -- a clean rewrite from the ground up in Java would probably destroy all of the problems and very much speed up development work.  </s>
<s> Indeed, after reading _Weaving the Web_, I think what the Web needs most is a stable, robust, easy to use browser/editor combination, probably written in Java, and with a new navigational feature I dreamed up (well, more like got inspired by Natrificial Technologies' products) -- a view that shows a graph whose nodes represent Web pages, the central one being the currently open page, and whose edges represent href links -- excluding stylesheet links, embedded images, and embedded objects.  </s>
<s> The graph would show the immediate "neighbor" pages in a ring around the current page, and their neighbors in turn, and so forth hyperbolically, with a highlighted color for the current page and the nearby pages that had the same hostname and, if present, the same username (~someone) in the URL.  </s>
<s> This way you'd see the boundaries of the current site.  </s>
<s> The nodes would only be displayed to two, three, or four steps distance from the source; clicking nodes would transform the graph and change the associated browser window's address.  </s>
<s> Ultimately an XML schema might be developed to allow Web page authors to control how this navigational method worked.  </s>
<s> It could allow, say, classification of links as parent/containment, sequential, or associative-jump, and allow links to have a word attached describing the relationship, which would appear by the link arrow in the navigation.  </s>
<s> To get an idea of how such a thing would appear, I suggest downloading the "Brain" from www.thebrain.com  </s>
<s> and taking it for a test drive.  </s>
<s> The navigation interface in this file organizer software looks close to an ideal navigation interface for the Web.  </s>
<s> Natrificial has a (ick) software patent on the interface, but I expect that you guys don't believe in software "patents" and I doubt software patents are recognized in France, or wherever it is you guys operate, so they'd have no jurisdiction to sue.  </s>
