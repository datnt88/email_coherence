Here is a draft of the requirements document. 
Please read so we can discuss it at the telecon this week.

Are these out of scope for the working group?

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Jon, No these are not out of scope. 
The following requirement does not mention scripting specifically, but I believe it covers it, "eneralized across technologies: WCAG 1.0 primarily addresses the needs of an accessible HTML page. 
WCAG 2.0 needs to encompass emerging technologies such as XML-based languages (e.g., SVG, SMIL, MathML, etc.)." we are dealing with improved navigation markup now. 
I sent a proposal to the UA and WCAG mailing lists on Tuesday. 
Also, I believe those issues are covered by the following open issues cited in the requirements draft document: "-Accurately identify what works, what may not, and why - test techniques, give results. 
ideas should be verified in some way. 
usability testing as we draft. 
how collect data? 
Deal with the "until user agents" clause which causes confusion. 
-specify user needs. 
even if we don't have an answer, we still need to describe the problem and whether the need is being met.? -Guidance to create pages for people with cognivite and learning disabilities, primarily navigation issues."
