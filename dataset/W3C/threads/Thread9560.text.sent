last telecon DanC asked, "is there a README for this [test case]"? 
I'm running a little behind* but I'm hoping by the end of today to have populated the existing test cases on a directory-by-directory basis with manifest.rdf 
files that describe the existing (approved) test cases. 
These will be collated into one larger file that should be readily machine-processable. 
I'll also have some skeleton files for Jos to stick details of his entailment tests into. 
At a first pass, these are going to be fairly minimalist** but there's room in the file for human-readable descriptions, pointers to emails, etc. should people feel that a test case requires more description. 
Again, this can be done on a directory-by-directory basis and slurped up afterwards. 
I'll be sticking some more words together over the weekend to revise the existing document; this should be in an internally-reviewable state by Monday. 
I'm away on Tuesday next week so, assuming things go according to schedule, I could do with a volunteer to translate things into en_US and check markup, etc. Cheers, jan * "expect the unexpected" is fast becoming my motto :-( ** minimalist = test type, status (APPROVED), related issue, input and output files, and an indication if a warning is to be raised. 
PS. Current test-case taxonomy: positive parser test (input: .rdf 
file(s); output: .nt 
file; optionally, an indication of a warning) negative parser test (input: bad .rdf 
file) positive RDF-entailment test (input: .rdf 
(or .nt) 
file(s); output: file containing a valid entailment according t the rules of RDF-entailment) negative RDF-entailment test (as above, but the entailment does not hold) ditto the above two test types but using the rules of RDFS-entailment as outlined by MT. Jos: I think this reflects the full extent of your test cases, or are there others? 
There are no DT-specific tests here.

This sounds like good progress Jan. Don't forget you don't have to do all the work yourself, you can ask for volunteers to help if you can identify bits of work that can be split off. 
Brian As Good As Possible indeed, we use the entailment rules per indirection of URI's like occuring in the subject-list of an entailment statement e.g. ( http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test001.nt http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# ) log:entails http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test004.nt . 
it's just a way to evolve... 
I'm fine with that Jan, that's what we actually have Jos
