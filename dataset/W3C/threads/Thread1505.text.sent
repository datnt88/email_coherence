But will there be another open window sometime in the future when this topic can be discussed again and a consensus of the group could change the definition of a configuration ? 
Definitely, when we are going for next standard level (draft standard). 
That will be a good time to revise any terminology that has proven to be confusing (such as the notorious "MOVE is COPY/DELETE" statement in 2518 ... always fun to pick on that :-). 
That's good enough for me. 
So I won't discuss the definition of a configuration any more for the time being. 
Out of curiosity :-) Could I get a feedback from some of the readers of the mailing list ? 
Just a note whether they think this topic should be discussed in the future or that they think it's irrelevant and I should forget about it. 
Then a plea to the parties I think are big players concerning implementing DeltaV. 
Is there any chance of a joint effort for creating a scenarios or validation suite document. 
From the top of my mind I can imagine Rational, Oracle, Merant, Microsoft, Apache, ... Cheers, Edgar edgar@edgarschwarz.de

Albert Einstein hi, I have a question regarding the Rational Rose model available at the Delta V web site. 
What is the reason for the Resource class not having the Report method listed as one of the operations.

Albert Einstein We're definitely interested in creating a validation suite. 
I'm probably going to be focusing on the JSR-147 "WVCM" effort for a while (defining a Java client-side API to the DeltaV/WebDAV protocol), and that effort requires a validations suite. 
So given the close coupling between WVCM and DeltaV/WebDAV, we should be able to derive a DeltaV/WebDAV validation suite from the WVCM validation suite.

From the top of my mind I can imagine Rational, Oracle, Merant, Microsoft, Apache, ... Just a bug (:-). 
That model is missing a goodly amount of stuff, and should be considered as just a very preliminary pass at creating such a model. 
I am working on a more extensive model for the WVCM effort (a client-side API for DeltaV/WebDAV), and I'll post that as soon as it is in a reasonably stable form (unfortunately, I can't yet predict when that will happen).

thanks, rajkumar That model is was for the DeltaV protocol itself, with no particular allignment to either the client or the server.
