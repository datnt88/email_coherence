I heard about a "uddi" URI scheme in the works in a presentation today, didn't see it on http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html.

Hi Mark, Your referenced message contains an unpublished first draft for an Internet-Draft to register the UDDI URI scheme. 
The message makes clear that the draft is incomplete and there are issues to be resolved. 
A little early to catalog at W3C, yet... Cheers, - Ira McDonald High North Inc I heard about a "uddi" URI scheme in the works in a presentation today, didn't see it on http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html.

From http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html: [[[ This is (an attempt at) an exhaustive list of URI schemes. 
We try to list them all, whether they're standard or not. 
If you know of any that aren't here, please tell us via uri@w3.org. 
]]] The page already lists several unregistered / pre-registered schemes. 
Cheers, I have to admit I don't try all that hard lately. 
The task is daunting... depressing, even. 
I feel kinda awkward acknowledging that I know about these schemes without contacting their authors to encourage them to register formally... but I haven't really constructed a reasonably persuasive argument about why they should do that. 
I'm inclined to retire the page and say "please let uri@w3.org 
know about any schemes you find, and try to get their authors to register officially". 
Another possibility is add something like "Good URIs don't use UnregisteredUriSchemes" to the wiki topic http://esw.w3.org/topic/GoodURIs and collaborate on why UnregisteredUriSchemes is an AntiPattern.

I did in fact retire it today. 
$Revision: 1.91 $ of $Date: 2003/09/11 22:32:28 $ I started that going... see and the 83 subtopics from the old list, plus the 2 new ones: doi and uddi Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
