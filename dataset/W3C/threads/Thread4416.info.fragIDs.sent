<s> Would you define 'item' please?  </s>
<s> It appears fairly central to the idea of sequences?  </s>
<s> It is not defined in the glossary.  </s>
<s> How have you addressed the requirement 2.2?  </s>

<s> Dave, An item is a node or an atomic value.  </s>
<s> See Chapter 2 in XPath 2.0.  </s>
<s> Yup.  </s>
<s> The Glossary (Appendix D) in XPath 2.0 is marked as "to be done".  </s>
<s> I guess that 16.5 in XSLT 2.0 is worth a look.  </s>
<s> If you are like me you will learn things about calendars that you didn't know before.  </s>
<s> :) A lot of 16.5 is new stuff.  </s>
<s> I hope that helps.  </s>
<s> Andrew Watt  </s>
<s> Yes indeed.  </s>
<s> The term is defined right in the first section of the data model document: "Every value handled by the data model is a sequence of zero or more items.  </s>
<s> An item is either a node or an atomic value."  </s>
<s> I guess you mean the XSLT glossary?  </s>
<s> At present this is just a list of those terms defined in the XSLT specification itself.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to bring in terms defined in the other specs - all it needs is a bit of stylesheet wizardry and a lot of coordination between the editors!  </s>
<s> You are presumably referring to XSLT requirement 2.2 (date formatting)?  </s>
<s> There is a checklist reporting on how all the requirements have been met at Unfortunately it doesn't retain the original numbering, but it does retain the ordering.  </s>
<s> It appears renumbered as requirement 10.  </s>
<s> There you will find a reference to the facility that meets this requirement, at Michael Kay  </s>
