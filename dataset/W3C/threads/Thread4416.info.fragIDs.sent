Would you define 'item' please? 
It appears fairly central to the idea of sequences? 
It is not defined in the glossary. 
How have you addressed the requirement 2.2?

Dave, An item is a node or an atomic value. 
See Chapter 2 in XPath 2.0. 
Yup. 
The Glossary (Appendix D) in XPath 2.0 is marked as "to be done". 
I guess that 16.5 in XSLT 2.0 is worth a look. 
If you are like me you will learn things about calendars that you didn't know before. 
:) A lot of 16.5 is new stuff. 
I hope that helps.

Yes indeed. 
The term is defined right in the first section of the data model document: "Every value handled by the data model is a sequence of zero or more items. 
An item is either a node or an atomic value." 
I guess you mean the XSLT glossary? 
At present this is just a list of those terms defined in the XSLT specification itself. 
It would be nice to bring in terms defined in the other specs - all it needs is a bit of stylesheet wizardry and a lot of coordination between the editors! 
You are presumably referring to XSLT requirement 2.2 (date formatting)? 
There is a checklist reporting on how all the requirements have been met at Unfortunately it doesn't retain the original numbering, but it does retain the ordering. 
It appears renumbered as requirement 10. 
There you will find a reference to the facility that meets this requirement, at Michael Kay
