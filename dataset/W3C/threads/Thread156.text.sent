First I must say that we greatly appreciate Tidy and, as best as I can enforce it, we use it to clean up the pages of MathSciNet from the Math Society. 
I hesitate to call this a bug but Tidy is doing bad by some bad html from Frontpage 4.0. 
Tidy throws away a name-anchor when it is represented as: P A NAME="clipboard" H3 Clipboard /H3 /A P " That becomes " H3 Clipboard /H3 ". 
I'm running as new a version as I could easily find. 
For completeness I'm including a) how it runs, b) the test input file and c) the output file.

Ann Arbor, Michigan American Mathematical Society a) how it runs Tidy (vers 30th April 2000) Parsing "frontpage.html" line 10 column 24 - Warning: missing /a before h3 line 10 column 24 - Warning: trimming empty p line 10 column 42 - Warning: discarding unexpected /a "frontpage.html" 
appears to be HTML 4.01 Transitional 3 warnings/errors were found! 
b) A fragment of htmp created by Frontpage..... lots more stuff deleted.... c) output file A fragment of htmp created by Frontpage..... P A NAME="clipboard" H3 Clipboard /H3 /A P " Hm, Tidy 7th July 1999: This is what you want and what is the right thing to do. 
Seems, that there were some changes for inline/blocklevel wrapping.

+{i} The mechanism for pushing/popping inline elements and for treating a interact in subtle ways. 
I hope that this time things will work better in the next release. 
should be mapped to: and to and a href="bar" some text a href="foo" ... to a href="bar" some text /a a href="foo" ... Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org

P A NAME="clipboard" H3 Clipboard /H3 /A P " I have fixed this and the result is now: when tidying to XHTML. 
The br's are produced as a consequence of finding the two empty P 's. n.b. P can't contain h3 . 
The fix will be included in the next release of Tidy. 
Many thanks for reporting this bug.
