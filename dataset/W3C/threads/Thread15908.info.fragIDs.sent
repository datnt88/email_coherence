<s> As I understand it, it is currently a lot easier and more efficient to transmit text which is converted to audio than vice versa.  </s>
<s> The deaf-blind, and those of us who are stuck with text-only would probably really appreciate this sort of approach to the technology - speech recognition is possible, but is also expensive in terms of the hardware and software required by an ordinary person.  </s>
<s> It seems that text will always be ahead of it in price, and easier to transmit, with the work of  </s>
<s> conversion to audio done by client-side applications.  </s>
<s> The point is that somebody watching a video is likely to have a sound-capable system.  </s>
<s> Somebody reading the text on an embossing printer,  </s>
<s> or small slow computer is more likely not to have access to the sound, let alone the additional system requirements to converty it to text.  </s>

<s> Charles McCN has given us an interesting post on the "business case."  </s>
<s> What do others think?  </s>
<s> I have just inserted my working draft of technology futures in the area Charles touches on.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Charles McCathieNevile said:  </s>
<s> AG:: Text is cheaper to send but that cost is decreasing rapidly.  </s>
<s> Audio is much easier on the ear.  </s>
<s> Synthetic speech is grueling to listen to for any length of time.  </s>
<s> AG:: It's cheaper today to set up for speech than Braille, and people are investing madly in the ability to bring that audio capability to market at lower and lower prices.  </s>
<s> Audio access devices are the telephone and walkman; these are cheap.  </s>
<s> It's the computer that is expensive, not the audio.  </s>
<s> Computers will catch up.  </s>
<s> The disabled should not let themselves settle into a backwater of un-supported technology.  </s>

<s> Reply to: RE  SMIL text and audio  </s>
<s> Regarding sending text or sending audio - this is not an either/or proposition - these alternate modes of presenting information in synchronization with moving audio or video or just graphics are useful for people with various disabilities as well as for translation purposes.  </s>
<s> Some people prefer movies audio-dubbed into their own language and some prefer subtitles - SMIL should allow either at the producers' option.  </s>
<s> - Larry  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Larry Goldberg said:  </s>
<s> Yes, whatever the producer wants, SMIL allows for either.  </s>
<s> You can even do both with a SWITCH wrapping them so that the consumer can choose among alternatives the producer has provided.  </s>
<s> Other things things that are not so nailed down are transformations that the producer didn't anticipate.  </s>
<s> Text-to-speech is the most common of these, but what if the the consumer has a speech recognition plug-in.  </s>
<s> Should they be able to bring up a subtitle window with what it guesses?  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> To follow up on what both Al and Larry have said: To me it would be important for the producer to package as both sound and text with the graphics, but it is equally important to for the consumer to be able to choose what they want.  </s>
<s> This is a pretty general rule that is being forgotten by many in the marketplace.  </s>
<s> The consumer is still king and those who cater to that will always be more successful.  </s>
<s> If you can let the consumer choose whether they want sound or text you will be better off.  </s>
<s> This could go for translations into various languages as well.  </s>
<s> In general it is my feeling that good customer service rules should apply in this area as well as any other area where you are presenting information to people.  </s>
<s> After all they can always go somewhere else.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Michael R. Burks The opinions expressed here are my own, not necessarily those of my employer.  </s>
<s> People always have to settle for the level of technology they can afford.  </s>
<s> For many of us, that means buying the least we can possibly survive with - it is not about being physically disabled, but financially - if I can make do with what someone else throws away I will be able to use the web, if not I cannot afford it at all.  </s>
<s> And speech does not help deaf people in the slightest.  </s>
<s> As audio technology improves, one part that improves is speech synthesis.  </s>
<s> Australian deaf people, as I understand it, learn Auslan as their first language - the Australian sign language.  </s>
<s> It has a grammar and vocabulary different to english, which they learn as a second language.  </s>
<s> Since that is the first language tey are likely to encounter, they are already at a disadvantage.  </s>
<s> If it is sent around as audio, and the have to rely on a piece of equipment that they have no other use for to make the files go back to text, they are likely to be left further and further out.  </s>
<s> In the world out there cost is a real factor.  </s>
<s> As Asia increas its online presece, it will be a bigger factor - currently Vietnam is said to have 3000 computers, it got ISPs in December, and there are 70 million people there.  </s>
<s> The amount of money they have to invest in technology solutions for blind people, deaf people, or any other group is limited, and the cheapest option has to be shown to be functionally inferior before it can be rejected.  </s>
<s> That includes the case where one person can have the 'best' or lots of people can have something that works better than nothing.  </s>
<s> (Sorry if I'm harping on - if so tell me to shut up) cheers Charles McCathieNevile Sunrise Research Laboratory RMIT University  </s>
<s> I agree with Charles about the cheapest option, at least to begin with.  </s>
<s> The fact is that before audio cards improved, the cost of a screen reader was much higher in terms of the equipment needed to make it work.  </s>
<s> Is the price dropping on technology?  </s>
<s> Of course it is, but this has to be measured in terms of the money available in any particular culture.  </s>
<s> Americans in particular have to tune themselves into this.  </s>
<s> We need to take a look at the overall situation in an area or country and make our decisions based on that, not on what is available in our culture alone.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Mike Burks The opinions expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my employer.  </s>

<s> Don't get me wrong.  </s>
<s> Text is the content format which is accessible (as of now) under the widest variety of disability conditions.  </s>
<s> A functioning backbone formed by text alone (but not necessarily isolated in text-only pages) is a virtual requirement for an accessible website.  </s>
<s> I think the Page Author Guidelines say this.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, show some of your clients whose first language is Auslan a SMIL program where there is a video caption track signed in Auslan, and tell me they'd rather have text.  </s>
<s> Unless we take the initiative in demonstrating how the backward compatible and the leading edge can be combined in a robust, flexible way we will continue to see new modes of inaccessibility springing up around hot techniques on the leading edge.  </s>
