<s> In Chapter 9 of "Building Accessible Web Sites," [1] Joe says "If I confuse this item with something else, will I make a mistake?  </s>
<s> Will I be unable to do what I want?"  </s>
<s> "keep in mind you always have to think in groups.  </s>
<s> When considering two  </s>
<s> items, is the first on top of the second?  </s>
<s> Or right alongside?"  </s>
<s> "Don't set red on black or black on red.  </s>
<s> Don't set green on red or red on green.  </s>
<s> Don't place the two halves of a confusable pair next to each other.  </s>
<s> Don't mix beige/yellow/orange with red and green.  </s>
<s> UNLESS  </s>
<s> There is no actual chance of confusion.  </s>
<s> The items are widely spaced.  </s>
<s> The items have considerable difference in brightness."  </s>
<s> "If, however, you wish to maximally avoid colour confusions, you have a range of colour choices at your disposal.  </s>
<s> Red/blue Steps: Dark red; medium red; light red; light blue; medium blue; dark blue  </s>
<s> Orange/blue Steps: Dark orange; medium orange; light orange; light blue; medium blue; dark blue Orange/purple  </s>
<s> Steps: Dark orange; medium orange; light orange; light purple; medium  </s>

<s> dark purple" "B-list: Brown/blue Steps: Dark brown; medium brown; light brown; light blue; medium blue; dark blue Yellow/blue Steps: Yellow; light blue; medium blue; dark blue"  </s>
<s> "You can mix white, black, and grey with confusable colours if the results,  </s>
<s> given foreground/background combinations, contrast, and other factors, are actually unconfusable.  </s>
<s> You can use confusable colours all you want if the confusion has no impact on the meaning or function of the site."  </s>
<s> In "Effective Color Contrast" by Aries Arditi, PhD [2], he says "Exaggerate lightness differences between foreground and background colors,  </s>
<s> and avoid using colors of similar lightness adjacent to one another, eve if  </s>
<s> they differ in saturation or hue...If you lighten your light colors and darken your dark colors, you will increase the visual accessibility of your  </s>
<s> design." (in reference to a color wheel described at [3]), "Choose dark colors with hues from the bottom half of the hue circle against light colors from the top half of the circle.  </s>
<s> Avoid contrasting light colors from the bottom half against dark colors from the top half."  </s>
<s> "Avoid contrasting hues from adjacent parts of the hue circle, especially if the colors do not contrast sharply in lightness."  </s>
<s> In other words, Choose dark [blue, violet, purple or red] against light [blue-green, green, yellow, or orange].  </s>
<s> Avoid light [blue, violet, purple or red] against dark [blue-green, green, yellow, or orange].  </s>
<s> Orange on red  </s>
<s> (or vice-versa) is not effective because they are next to each other in the  </s>
<s> color wheel.  </s>
<s> Yellow on purple (or vice versa) is effective since they are not adjacent.  </s>
