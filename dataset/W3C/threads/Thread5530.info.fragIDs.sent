<s> WSTF &amp; WAI Team, Please reply to this message as soon as possible, preferably by end of day Tuesday 6 April.  </s>
<s> Since the WSTF's last discussion on WAI working group home pages, the WAI Team (that is, W3C staff Judy, Wendy, Matt, and Shadi) agreed to re-organize their working group home pages to a consistent format (headings and in-page links) by the end of this week (still using that same old style for now).  </s>
<s> I reviewed the content on all of the current working group home pages, reviewed our agreed-upon audience write-up (linked below), and walked through some tasks.  </s>
<s> Based on this further analysis, I recommend some small changes to what we previously discussed, primarily: - making the subtopics under About [working group name] h2 s - adding an optional last category "Additional Information" I updated the draft with these recommendations at: www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg and implemented them in the EOWG home page (with old style) at: www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ and a UAWG ROUGH DRAFT (with essentially no style) at: www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag-wg-css1.html - please ignore the layout for now, just look at the center column.  </s>
<s> Please review the format (headings) at www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg and reply to this list (not shawn@w3.org):  </s>
