As I recall: - the WG has considered this. 
At the time it made its decision, Pat advocated accepting that lang tags be allowed in the syntax, that it was harmless 
Yes, I did say that, didnt I? Sigh. 
and seemed at the time to be important to Patrick who stated that Nokia felt strongly about the issue. 
- later Patrick reported that after further thought, that whilst Nokia still preferred the lang tag to be allowed in a datatyped literal, they could live without it. 
I had forgotten about the Nokia request. 
But read on. 
Before last call, this is perhaps something we could have considered. 
Now its a change. 
Might anyone change their review based on it? 
Well, yes, it seemed important to Nokia. 
Well, OK, but how about the other option I gave? 
Leave the lang tags alone, don't change the syntax, but just allow as a possibility that a datatype might be tag-sensitive. 
Of course the XSD datatypes aren't, and we can say so explicitly, but some datatypes might be. 
Our home-grown one is, for example, so why not allow Nokia (to choose an example at random) the freedom to define, say, German decimals, or whatever, and then have the same kind of freedom to move tags between RDF and the innards of their typed literal strings that we have given ourselves for XML? 
This is technically a change, I admit, but the only document it seriously impinges on, I think, is semantics; any changes to other documents will simply be deletions of any prose that says that rdf:XMLiteral is 'exceptional' in having lang-tagged pairs in its lexical space. 
And the changes to semantics will mostly be deletions of the silly inference rules rdfD0a and b, (section 4.3, would be better off not having. 
How important is this Pat. 
Is it worth a second last call? 
If its just a case of extra work in writing the semantics - then I think you've made your bed. 
If it has undesirable externally visible consequences, that might be different. 
Well, nobody else has complained, admittedly, but I think that rdfD0a/b is an undesirable externally visible consequence. 
When the WG was discussing this stuff I was maybe remiss in not rubbing our collective noses in the fact that this would be a consequence of what we were deciding. 
As I recall, we were SOO tired of datatyping that nobody wanted any more controversy at the time :-) Would this change really require a second last call? 
It would make no difference to any current datatyping, it would only be a simplification which would make the overall design more coherent. 
The rdfD0 rules would still apply to XSD-typed literals, and we can say that and state the rules explictly, just like we do now, but they would not be logically required for all datatypes. 
Right now it feels to me that we are kind of holding a gun to the head of all future datatype definers: they aren't *allowed* to take the lang tags into account. 
And yet we *insist* on having them in the syntax. 
What do we say, if they come back and ask us why? 
The issue is not keeping the semantics simpler. 
I can make the bed either way. 
But I think it has a pea under the mattress right now which others will eventually notice.

The current design of RDF literals is needlessly complicated and kind of silly. 
The syntax allows language tags to occur in typed literals, but in all cases other than rdf:XMLLiteral, these tags are required to have no meaning, so the semantics is obliged to provide a valid inference rule which allows any language tag in any such typed literal to be removed or replaced by any other. 
This considerably complicates the statement of the semantics, adds a burden to any implementation, nullifies the implicit design principle that literals can be compared for identity using simple lexical matching (since an engine is required to strip out all such lang tags while performing inferences or checking for identity), and provides no useful expressive function. 
A related point is that the requirement in the semantics that datatypes other than rdf:XMLLiteral *must* ignore language tags seems to restrict possible future datatyping proposals needlessly. 
I suggest therefore that EITHER (1) lang tags be forbidden by the RDF syntax from appearing in non-XML typed literals. 
OR ELSE (2) the notion of the lexical space of a datatype be generalized to allow (not require) lang tags to be taken into consideration by a datatype, so that the lexical space may be a set of strings or pairs of strings, i.e. a set of simple literals. 
This would have the effect that it would no longer be valid to make arbitrary changes to a lang tag in any literal, typed or not. 
It would also bring the treatment of all RDF datatypes into alignment so that rdf:XMLLiteral need not be considered a special case. 
Either of these changes will simplify the semantics and make it more coherent, but in slightly different ways. 
Either change will produce fewer inference rules and lead to less processing in a reasoning engine.

[just to make sure w.r.t. rdf comments] We currently have (in our test code) that 
test#x test#y "10"@en^^xsd:int. 
rdfs xsd entails test#x test#y "10"@fr^^xsd:int. 
(i.e. ignoring the lang tag) 
and that test#x test#y "chat"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral. does not rdf entail test#x test#y "chat"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral. (which is straightforward as a builtin) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/

How about 
test#x test#y "10"@en^^xsd:int . 
entails test#x test#y "10"^^xsd:int . 
and vice versa?

we have tested and it is the case 
same answer so basically it is ignoring the lang tag Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
PS I was extremely agreeing with your unifier story in webont, it is really easy to to do, in say 20 or 30 lines of Java or C# code, no big deal, much shorter than all the lines of e-mail/issues same story for ^^ term unifiers pat hayes .edu

I think this would be less surprising to users of RDF/XML; e.g. rdf:RDF xmlns ... xml:lang="EN" In this interpretation of language tags that Pat suggests, the presence of an outer language tag would not upset the inner datatyped interpretation.
