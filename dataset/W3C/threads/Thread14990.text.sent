I have a concern, with Checkpoint 5.2 - Ensure that technologies relied upon by the content are declared and widely available. 
The success criteria makes no mention of technologies that can only be used on specific operating systems. 
At present we require that technologies and features on the required list are available in at least two independently-developed implementations. 
But no mention of weather it is possible to develop applications for other platforms. 
What if they are only supportable one a specific platform? 
In other works if a web author choses to use a technologies that can only be accessible on Lynix or can only be accessible to user agents run on Microsoft - surely that can not be considered accessible. 
This is even more the case when the operating system required is not free. 
It must be an undue burden on the end user to expect him/her to buy a new operating system to view your site I recommend that all technologies should be supportable on any operating system, and that that should be a level one requirement. 
Should we also specify that the independently-developed implementations are not themselves dependent on the same proprietary , restricted (non-free) components? 
all the best Lisa I'm not sure I understand this, Lee. 
JAWS 4.5 supports Flash MX through MSAA; so does Window-Eyes, a competing product. 
Flash MX includes features designed to support accessibility. 
Are you saying that a developer who uses Flash MX cannot make a conformance claim even if the Flash content is accessible to people who are using both Window-Eyes and JAWS? 
If this is in fact what we're saying, it worries me-- it sounds like we might be raising the bar to an impossible height.

The reasoning for two independent implementations was to limit the concept that one group would benefit while another would not. 
At least that was my goal when Jason and I proposed this wording. 
There was to be included a segment that stated that no one could claim an accessible status if they required tools that were built upon the same engine. 
Therefore, any tool using the Internet Explorer engine would have to be considered when the other tool used the same engine. 
It was also pointed out that there is only one user agent that supports the MSAA required by Flash MX. 
I believe that was Window-Eyes. 
Therefore, any site that wanted to claim an accessible status using Flash MX would not be able to do such. 
At least until another user agent provided the access for Flash MX and did not require the MSAA or the Internet Explorer engine. 
(NOTE: not trying to pick on Flash) Sincerely, Lee Roberts President/CEO 405-321-6372 Rose Rock Design, Inc. -----Original Message----- Of Lisa Seeman (by way of Wendy A Chisholm wendy@w3.org ) A few clarifications: I am referring to 5.2 in http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ checkpoint 5.2 reads: Ensure that technologies relied upon by the content are declared and widely available. 
success criteria level two reads: Technologies and features on the required list are available in at least two independently-developed implementations. 
Now what is happening is people are claiming accessibility based on technologies that can only be used on the windows/intel platform, and assistive technologies that do not run on window, can not, with all the will in the world, provide support. 
I see a big difference hear between developing based on a free download, or even a none non-free application, and developing for, say, only IBM with windows. 
(hay I use IBM and windows, but that is not the point) Part of the difference is that the user can get a new user agent a lot easer then he can sell his mac and buy an IBM. 
But the BIG difference is that developers of assistive technology for other platforms are barred from developing support. 
The do not have the API's. 
They can not do it. 
It seems to me that this allows potential monopolies, and such games to be played in the assistive technology/platform market. 
I think that it is the disabled who will pay the price. 
Any standard that are relied on for fulfillment of these guidelines must be open and usable on more then one, independently owned, platform. 
Lisa I'm concerned that I think Lisa's request goes beyond this, that it doesn't matter how many Assistive Technologies vendors support a technology on Windows. 
As long as AT is only available on Windows, the technology should not be considered accessible. 
We wrestled a lot with what we wanted this checkpoint to say. 
It is a very difficult issue. 
Lisa, I assume you are requesting that we re-open the discussion. 
Loretta To The Group - I, too, believe that Lisa's comments go beyond "just" the technologies that are possibly programmed into a web page or an entire site. 
I am having a difficult time trying to figure out the "real" issue. 
Lisa, am I wrong in thinking that you are saying (possibly), some operating platforms/systems are being ignored when it comes to vendors making accessible products/agents/technologies for a lesser selling operating system. 
If this is what you are saying, I can tell you, you are 100% correct. 
In the early years of assistive technology, Macintosh was superior with regard to assistive technology (stuff built into their system and software developers making AT products for the Mac). 
In my humble opinion, I have seen the PC world jump way ahead of Mac related to accessibility products and supports. 
Some vendors are no longer developing multi-platform products, especially assistive tech products. 
Is this what you were talking about? 
Thoughts?
