<s> Hi Michael, That sounds like a sensible approach but I would suggest that it is implemented in a way that makes any such lists easy to update and edit - a little future proofing.  </s>
<s> Cheers Anthony Just so you know what the techniques group is up to, we are indeed thinking of issues around browser support.  </s>
<s> For techniques that are only supported in certain user agents, or that go awry in certain user agents, that information will be stored with the technique.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to pull up lists of techniques that work on certain setups or that you should avoid.  </s>
<s> We've also identified a potential need to create techniques that are specifically workarounds for user agent problems.  </s>
<s> How we'll do that exactly is not yet determined and it could be an endless task, so we'll probably narrow it down by restricting it to moderately recent versions of technologies, but hopefully that addresses the issue you're raising.  </s>
<s> As far as architectural materials go, that is likely to be minimized in the techniques themselves, but we will explicitly link to relevant resources.  </s>
<s> So the information should be available in context even though it's not part of the substance of the techniques themselves.  </s>

<s> At one point, this thread was about how to support a teaching task where a student was, with difficulty, learning to use a mouse.  </s>
<s> Pardon me if this has all been said, I searched the archives in vain for "applet" in this thread and failing that, elected to write.  </s>
<s> In this context, any system response other than the response to the primary mouse button would be a confusion factor, and a major hazard.  </s>
<s> But the task is to be performed in a school where the teacher doesn't necessarily have access to tweaking the mouse driver for the student because the computer is shared and the OS settings are locked down by the overworked IT department.  </s>
<s> Several avenues of relief suggest themselves: a) in the short term, use an applet where right mouse clicks do nothing or elicit a mild complaint.  </s>
<s> A variant of this is the CAROUSEL prototype where the applet is a very simple thing which displays raster graphics and forwards events to a servlet where you adapt the event responses as you see fit.  </s>
<s> b) in the medium term, the schools administration should eventually understand that this learning task is one that they need to support and the means to get the workstation into one-button-mouse mode be implemented by the IT team in a way so the teacher can exercise it without breaking the workstation for other users.  </s>
<s> This need not be that far off.  </s>
<s> There are utilities, sometimes within the OS, to save off the preferences of an individual user and even move them from machine to machine.  </s>
<s> c) in the longer term, the strategy being pursued by WGBH and Toronto and others in the package of accessibility-important learner preferences discussed in drafts at Welcome to IMS Global Learning Consortium: Specification: Accessibility will make it possible for a) the need to go into one-button-mouse-mode to follow the user effortlessly between shared workstations, and b) the change to this mode be made reversibly in ways quality-controlled by the IT team.  </s>
<s> In the long run the hope is that something on this order will filter back into the Web from educational use, through CC/PP.  </s>
<s> Al PS: You could perhaps find that this mouse training goes better if the one active button _always_ goes to the context menu.  </s>
<s> Don't disable the right button, disable the left button.  </s>
<s> Let the function usually short-cut bound to leftClick be only activated by a mouseDown, mouseMove, mouseUp sequence.  </s>
<s> The gesture is harder, but the process is more self-evident.  </s>
<s> It's easier to comprehend the relationship between user action and system response in this verbose mode.  </s>
<s> For users with high spurious input symbol generation rates, the usual compensation strategy is to introduce a two-phase commit (confirm step).  </s>
<s> Despite the limitations of your students, I don't yet know that they wouldn't understand the articulated interaction better than the abrupt one.  </s>
<s> It sounds as though you may need to slow them down, and the carrot of a system response when they plod may actually work.  </s>
<s> Al, In general I have respect for your comments, and as you will know am waiting to be invited to join PFWG.  </s>
<s> in this instance you may not have the necessary experience, or access to appropriate research reports either.  </s>
<s> Some users will always need non-standard responses because they are taking a while to learn the standard response and need it broken into steps.  </s>
<s> For instance the trackerball can separate movement and clicking very effectively.  </s>
<s> However these are very expensive, and a college of 27,000 students has only one that I know of.  </s>
<s> The leaves(1) web activity disables clicking, so that users can learn about moving at little if any additional cost, similarly the lightening activity ignores mouse movement.  </s>
<s> You'll recognise that in this situation, the context menu is of very little interest to our users, they cannot read, and many would not understand the implications.There is no confusion, because this is their only web experience.  </s>
<s> Other users without SLD are far more able to understand the issues, and move elsewhere if they are not enjoying the experience, or find it disabling.However it is important that other users understand their issues, and this is much more easily achieved through demonstration and experience than by textual description.  </s>
<s> People who create activities that disable the right mouse, for whatever reason (because they believe it protects their intellectual property?) actually contribute resources that may suit some of our users now, not in some fictitious future utopia.  </s>
<s> Why is an applet disabling right clicking preferable to javascript?  </s>
<s> note we stopped using java because it is less easily shared.  </s>
<s> Moving user configuration is not currently possible due to log in issues, a swipe card could resolve this, however, by insisting that this is an OS issue the user's difficulty is being excluded from the advantages that networking provides, and this is misguided.  </s>
<s> For instance, if there is an online course, that eventually trains the user sufficiently, so that right clicking should now be enabled, how is this to be achieved?  </s>
<s> in reality it is most likely that the user would get small amounts of time with the extra functionality interspersed with longer periods in a known or rehearsed environment.  </s>
<s> This is an ongoing dilemma, and one that is unlikely to ever be resolved successfully, hence it is important to provide alternatives.  </s>
<s> I am already effectively an external expert in the college, and certainly not part of the internal IT department.  </s>
<s> The IT department is always trying to downsize, at least with respect to student numbers.  </s>
<s> It is already problematical getting plugins installed, javascript enabled, SurfPatrol removed, configuration permissions, or administrator privileges.  </s>
<s> It is simply not going to be possible that outside experts are going to be given access to the OS in the future.  </s>
<s> A significant number of the most able producers of online materials for people with SLD have moved to flash.  </s>
<s> If W3 cannot be flexible enough to create accessible resources, this will only encourage more.  </s>
<s> In fact the bulk of materials are produced for CD distribution, and this circumnavigates the problem but for the worst reasons.  </s>
<s> The CD comes from a trusted source, so is able to do much, however the resources are locked in and difficult to share, there is little or no networking.  </s>
<s> The benefits of the web are absent.  </s>
<s> If you know of specific webpages relating IMS and people with severe learning difficulties, please post a URI.  </s>
