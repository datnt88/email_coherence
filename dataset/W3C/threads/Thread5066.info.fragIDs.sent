<s> Mike, Indeed, while OWL Full does not explicitly have qualified cardinality restrictions, OWL Full can cover many of the cases that Alan mentions (though not ideally).  </s>
<s> Perhaps encoding how to do that is a good case for a design pattern?  </s>
<s> Non-special-purpose reasoners probably wouldn't know what to do with them though.  </s>
<s> I agree with others who pointed out that the goal of this group is to deal with what we have in terms of languages (RDF, OWL).  </s>
<s> However, suggesting to work around some of their limitations is certainly within the scope (and should be addressed).  </s>
<s> Below are my comments on some of Alan's examples (the list is very impressive indeed!)  </s>
<s> what about a workaround of creating a property hasCarboxylicAcidGroup, a subProperty of hasStructuralComponent, cardinality 3 and allValuesFrom CarboxylicAcidGroup.  </s>
<s> It doesn't address the proliferation concern, but seems to deal with all the others (assuming you will use this relationships in your definition of Krebs Cycle).  </s>
<s> The way the Foundational Model of Anatomy deals with this (or, more precisely, a reasonably accurate translation into OWL of the way FMA deals with this, since FMA is not defined in OWL) is by reifying the cardinality-value pair.  </s>
<s> Naturally, only special-purpose reasoners will be able to deal with this, and this is very much in OWL Full.  </s>
<s> Also, given the level of detail at which FMA models anatomy, in most cases that I've seen (perhaps not all) what you want for QCRs is cardinality 1.  </s>
<s> In the context of the FMA, these can be handled through hasValue restriction (but since values would be classes, it is again OWL Full).  </s>
<s> actually, this one is simple (by virtue of cardinality being 2).  </s>
<s> You define cardinality restriction of 2 for spouses property for the class Marriage with allValuesFrom (Male OR Female).  </s>
<s> Same-sex marriage is a Marriage where (spouse allValuesFrom Male) OR (spouse allValuesFrom Female) "traditional" marriage is a Marriage where (spouse someValuesFrom Male) AND (spouse someValuesFrom Female) Again, not the most straightforward way, but easily handled by OWL DL. (After all, we handle all the different marriages pretty easily here in the San Francisco area :) My general point here is that there are ways to deal with these (although perhaps it would have been easier if there were QCRs, but this is not the forum to discuss pros and cons).  </s>
<s> And it may indeed be a good starting point for some of the design patterns.  </s>
<s> Natasha  </s>
<s> Yes agreed - however I would prioritise more basic problems in documenting how to make good use of RDF and OWL.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Sorry I had misunderstood that.  </s>
