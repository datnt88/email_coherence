Great. 
To summarize XSLT will 2.0 will be consistent with XML 1.0 (inc erratum) and the inclusion of an XML prolog will not be a 'MUST'. 
Will it be a 'CAN', if I want to do it? 
Thanks v much Deborah Parameter Deborah, In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization. 
4.5 XML Output Method: the omit-xml-declaration Parameter This says: "The omit-xml-declaration parameter must be ignored if the standalone parameter is present, or if the encoding parameter specifies a value other than UTF-8 or UTF-16." 
I would like to control the output of the omit-xml-declaration parameter, where the encoding parameter specifies a value other than UTF-8 or UTF-16. 
I often don't use Unicode. 
I would like the option to output with non-standard encoding as XHTML. 
The XHTML standard ( not required in all XML documents"; it is often desirable to omit it, given that it is known that there are unexpected results with some user agents. 
Thank you for your comment. 
The XSL and XQuery Working groups discussed your comment. 
As originally written, XML 1.0 required an XML declaration or a text declaration if the encoding of the document or external general parsed entity was anything other than UTF-8 or UTF-16. 
XSLT 1.0 enforced that requirement in its serialization mechanism. 
The draft of Serialization inherited that behaviour from XSLT 1.0. 
However, an erratum to XML 1.0 removed that requirement. 
In response to your comment, the working groups decided to require the XML declaration or text declaration to be omitted, regardless of the setting of the encoding parameter. 
Serialization will permit an XML declaration or text declaration to be omitted in precisely those circumstances in which it can be omitted according to XML 1.0 and XML 1.1. 
This would affect both the xml and xhtml output methods. 
As that is the change you requested, I believe that decision will be acceptable to you. 
May I ask you to confirm that it is?

I think (hope) that the decision of the WGs is: When the output method is XML, an XML declaration will be output if and only if the omit-xml-declaration parameter has the value "no". 
In XSLT, the default value will be "no".

Hello, I see that my description of the decision wasn't as precise as I'd wanted it to be. 
The decision was, as Michael Kay indicated, that the value of the omit-xml-declaration parameter is always respected: the declaration is output if and only if the parameter has the value "no". 
Further, it will be a serialization error if the parameter has the value "yes", but the settings of other parameters would require an XML or text declaration to be emitted. 
In particular, an XML or text declaration is required if the standalone parameter has the value "yes" or the value "no", or if the version parameter has a value other than "1.0", and the doctype-system parameter is supplied. 
In response to your comment, the setting of the encoding parameter is never considered to conflict with the setting of the omit-xml-declaration parameter. 
A host language can ensure that such a serialization error will never occur - in particular, XSLT will ensure that the values of parameters will never conflict in this way.
