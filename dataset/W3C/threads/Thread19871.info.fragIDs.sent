Hi, in a document where I describe some aspects of HTML 3.2 syntax, I realized that Amaya seems to ignore the "nowrap" attribute in a table cell. 
Just to illustrate the use of the attribute, I have a table with one row of two cells. 
Both cells contain the same text, but the left cell has the nowrap attribute. 
With the following code, TD nowrap &amp;ecirc;tre ou ne pas &amp;ecirc;tre, telle est la question the left cell should be much wider than the right one. 
But Amaya shows both cells with equal width. 
Am I missing something or is it a problem with Amaya ignoring the attribute? 
I am using the pre-compiled Solaris 2.5 release of Amaya 1.2. 
Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.

Thanks very much for all your comments. 
We're preparing the next Amaya release 1.2a and it's too late to take them into account in this new release. 
We'll try to fix these bugs as soon as possible. 
Regards Irene. 
Recently I have download amaya1.2 and when I try to compile it, i get complaint on editor.h 
file not found. 
And when I check amaya directory there are not editor.h but editor.a . 
Can have some clue on this matter? 
Looi
