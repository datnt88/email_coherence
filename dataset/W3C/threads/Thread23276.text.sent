Can someone clarify the getElementsByName method for me. 
It appears in DOM1 but not in DOM2 or DOM3 WD. 
I see that it exists both in IE6 and in NS6 - although it doesn't seem to work on the SVG documents that I have tested it in. 
Has it been removed from the spec? 
If not should it be available on documentElements other than the html element. 
For example should it be available on the svg element? 
Thanks in advance, Jonathan. 
It's in DOM2 HTML (not DOM Core). 
And therefore it is not guaranteed to be present for things like SVG. Boris 617-864-9910 If you put garbage in a computer nothing comes out but garbage. 
But this garbage, having passed through a very expensive machine, is somehow ennobled and none dare criticize it. 
I see. 
Thanks Boris. 
Can I suggest that getElementsByName would be just as useful in other things (as well as HTML). 
In fact often even more so. 
In HTML many collections already exist, but not so for something like SVG. Hence if I create some radio buttons in an SVG document and give them all the same name I don't have the advantage of a collection ready made as I would in HTML. 
It would be very useful if getElementsByName was moved back to DOM-Core. 
Is there any reason that it was thought to be specific to HTML? 
Can I have your thoughts please? 
Jonathan. 
"Name" is not a defined concept that crosses all markup languages expected to be processed through the DOM. 
It's quite HTML-specific. 
We already have getElementsByNodeName. 
DOM Level 3 will presumably introduce the ability to retrieve elements by ID attribute, as part of the DTD/Schema support. 
A schema-specific set of APIs could support Keys as well. 
And of course you can always write a NodeFilter and plug it into a TreeWalker or NodeIterator -- which may not be as highly optimized as the above, but allows you the flexibility to define your own behaviors. 
Or -- assuming it survives into the REC and your DOM implements it -- try the XPath API. 
So there are lots of possible ways to address this use case in a more general and portable manner. 
I don't see a need to add getElementsByName, specifically, to the core DOM. 
Now, if the SVG DOM APIs wanted to add this method to _their_ APIs, because it was meaningful to them -- more power to them.
