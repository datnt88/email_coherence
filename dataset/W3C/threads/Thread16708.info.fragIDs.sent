<s> Okay, I am using the latest version of JFW on a Windows 2000 box.  </s>

<s> Home Page Reader and Lynx don't have this problem!  </s>
<s> (2) Am I doing something wrong?  </s>
<s> Is there a reasonable way around this obstacle?  </s>
<s> I even adjusted the "HTML Graphics Verbosity" level.  </s>
<s> Now JAWS reads the file name of the graphic, but still not the alt content.  </s>
<s> Please advise.  </s>

<s> I agree that this particular problem is a bug with JAWS.  </s>
<s> As you know, I am a big fan of spec-compliant coding and UA.  </s>
<s> As far as browsers go, we've got maybe IE on the Mac and Netscape/Mozzilla 6 that come close to rendering HTML 4 tolerably well.  </s>
<s> What behavior would be reasonable for a browser for code like: a href="foo.html"  </s>
<s> title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png"  </s>
<s> alt="Come to Foo!" /a The current state of the art is, I would argue, fairly reasonable and predictable.  </s>
<s> With a screen reader, the link title and graphic alt are read in sequence.  </s>
<s> It is actually clear which belongs to which.  </s>
<s> Screen reader or not, I can preview the link title before activating the link.  </s>
<s> Graphically, a mouse-over pop-up has a choice of two content pieces and, quite reasonably, the title of the link takes precedence (and this additional information is rendered rather subtly).  </s>
<s> Oh yeah, I also have the image or the associated alt -- depending if graphics are loaded or not.  </s>
<s> Okay then, with screen reader or not, my browser has unobtrusively presented me with (1) a graphic or ALT content, (2) URL and associated (title) text.  </s>
<s> Life is good.  </s>
<s> Now, suppose I want to be on the bleeding edge.  </s>
<s> Or maybe I am confused about what makes good ALT content -- and I am trying to make everybody happy.  </s>
<s> I mistakenly figure that more is more, so I code something like: a href="foo.html"  </s>
<s> title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png"  </s>
<s> title="Foo Globe Icon" alt="Come to Foo!" /a Sure, this is perfectly logical and valid.  </s>
<s> But face it, this gives me THREE textual associations for the graphic.  </s>
<s> As the author, there is no way I could guess what the user is going to get!  </s>
<s> I cannot come up with a scenario that would reveal all three (or even two out of three) in any natural way (with out requiring extra keystrokes on the part of the user, or some other artifice) for a graphical user agent.  </s>
<s> Can you?  </s>
<s> Please Kynn, if you think titles should be included everywhere, please  </s>
<s> explain how they might be revealed in the graphical user interface!  </s>
<s> It gets  </s>
<s> even more complicated, since the above example could be inside a P or DIV with its own title!  </s>
<s> Yeech!  </s>
<s> TITLE is largely superfluous, except on links and ABBR and ACRONYM.  </s>
<s> Until  </s>
<s> user agents figure out how to handle the attribute, it should be avoided.  </s>
<s> This IS a practical, real world, accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> Kynn, depending on the weather, you are frequently in favor of backwards  </s>
<s> compliant coding and even minor code tweaks to make up for idiosyncratic  </s>
<s> behavior of Assistive Technology.  </s>
<s> I would argue that this belongs in that  </s>
<s> category.  </s>
<s> Unless you are certain of the resultant browser behavior, avoid  </s>
<s> TITLE.  </s>
<s> -- Bruce  </s>
<s> P.S. One _could_ make the argument that the behavior of JAWS is NOT broken:  </s>
<s> TITLE is a newer attribute than ALT and therefore an author is more likely  </s>
<s> to put more thought into TITLE (if present) than ALT (especially since we  </s>
<s> know how bad ALT tends to be).  </s>
<s> Besides, IE visually renders TITLE in  </s>
<s> deference to ALT -- so that is the one people pay more attention to.  </s>
<s> Therefore, if both are present, TITLE must be the more important one -- so that's the one that should get read by the screen reader.  </s>
<s> From: Kynn Bartlett Sent: Monday, February 5, 2001 1:00 PM Subject: Re: use of alt attributes in decorative images  </s>
<s> This sounds to me like a user agent problem, not a markup problem.  </s>
<s> The markup is done properly, but the assistive technology fails on it; whose responsibility is it to correct this problem?  </s>
<s> In my opinion, it's on the shoulders of the JFW people -- but if someone is specifically designing an interface for JFW (such as an edaptive system that recognizes JAWS), the optimal code for that user agent should be delivered.  </s>
<s> Sure it is -- the user agent is not respecting the spec, and neither is your humble opinion, so why should we listen to either?  </s>
<s> Title is meant to be used, potentially, EVERYWHERE, and a user agent which breaks on such a circumstance is a faulty user agent.  </s>
<s> The question then becomes whether or not you should compensate for that problem in the user agent (in my model with an edaptive interface, I would say yes), but you surely should not condone this type of faulty behavior by suggesting that _only_ links can have titles, because JFW got it wrong.  </s>
<s> I don't think I've said titles should be included _everywhere_, but I don't agree with you that it's -incorrect- to include titles.  </s>
<s> How should they be revealed in the GUI?  </s>
<s> I don't think I've said they should be revealed in the GUI either.  </s>
<s> They're metadata, and metadata shouldn't necessarily be revealed in all presentations.  </s>

<s> TAKE CONTROL.  </s>
<s> Dear Kynn, My sincere apologies for upsetting you.  </s>
<s> I really didn't mean to insult you, and my "depending on the weather" cut was uncalled for.  </s>
<s> As you wrote, perhaps you are the paragon of philosophical consistency -- and I am just too dull to appreciate it.  </s>
<s> I don't agree with promoting techniques (e.g., using TITLE attributes superfluously) that interferes with the accessibility of current products (e.g., JFW), even if future products (e.g., Edapta) will remediate such coding.  </s>
<s> The fact that such a practice is (technically) syntactically valid, hardly mitigates against the current usability issue.  </s>
<s> Yep, titles are metadata.  </s>
<s> Yep, GUI browsers tend to render them as ToolTips (what I was calling mouse-over pop-ups).  </s>
<s> Yep, tool tips can be useful (which is why I cited their use in links, abbr and acronym).  </s>
<s> Those points we agree on.  </s>
<s> The disagreement is that you are willing to promote (currently useless -- the search engines don't even process them) metadata when we know that IN ACTUAL PRACTICE this sacrifices accessibility?!? Forgive me, but I don't believe the pre-Edapta Kynn would have suggested such a thing!  </s>
<s> You didn't answer my hard question: Given the three (!) reasonable choices, what is an algorithm for deciding what the ToolTips text content should be for the following example?  </s>
<s> a href="foo.html"  </s>
<s> title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png"  </s>
<s> title="Foo Globe Icon" alt="Come to Foo!" /a It doesn't get much easier when one has to decide the reasonable behavior of a screen reader!  </s>
<s> JAWS, when faced with this vague situation, favors TITLE content over ALT.  </s>
<s> This choice is arbitrary, but not entirely illogical.  </s>
<s> The simple solution to this quandary is for authors to skip the TITLE attribute -- unless one has some clear expectations for browser behavior.  </s>
<s> Don't expect the browser (screen reader or not) to make the right choice.  </s>
<s> As a content provider, don't expect the machine browser to read your mind!  </s>
<s> Avoid this ambiguity.  </s>
