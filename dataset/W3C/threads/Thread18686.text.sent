Dear UAWG, I am pleased to announce the publication of the 8 July 2002 UAAG 1.0 [1] and Techniques documents [2]. 
Please consult the list of changes [3] from the 12 September 2001 Candidate Recommendation (important changes highlighted below). 
This draft incorporates resolutions to (twenty-six) issues that have arisen during CR [4], and the changes we have agreed to make to checkpoints with low implementation experience [5]. 
I urge you to read this draft, since I hope (and believe) that this will be the last round of major changes to UAAG 1.0. 
Please send comments about the document to this list, indicating what you find unclear or incorrect. 
I recommend a deadline for comments of 24 July; please indicate whether you wish to review the document but cannot before that date. 
After that, we will return to last call for several weeks (I hope starting late July, taking into account that many people will be on vacation in August). 
After last call (and processing review comments), we expect to request that the Director advance the document directly to Proposed Recommendation. 
During the next couple of weeks, I hope to work with Jon and Matt to update the implementation report[6] in light of the changes we have made. 
We will also need to document expectations for the next last call, in particular how we will handle the remaining checkpoints with low implementation experience. 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20020708/ [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20020708/ [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes#WD-UAAG10-20020708 [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2 [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2002/06/checkpoint-overview [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/report-cr2 
Some of the major changes that deserve your review include: 0) Checkpoints 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 4.7: Must do for all formats. 
1) Checkpoint 4.1: Rewritten to clarify the intent. 
2) Checkpoint 4.6: Now only about captions legibility. 
3) Checkpoint 4.14: Rewritten to clarify the intent. 
4) Checkpoint 10.1: Now for graphical user agents only (cells/headers) 5) Guideline 6: Revised checkpoints related to APIs and infoset 6) Guideline 10: Checkpoints 10.2, 10.3, and 10.6 revised to be about highlight configurability. 
7) Introduction: New section 1.5 "Themes in this document". 
This section may help answer some questions that I encountered when doing evaluations. 
8) Conformance: * New section on security (part of section 3.3) * New section 3.6: Events label * New section 3.12: Including UAAG 1.0 requirements in other specifications. 
Includes how to create a conformance profile in another spec. 
* Deleted VisualText and ColorText content type labels. 
We deleted about 10 checkpoints and portions of about 5 other checkpoints (all indicated in the list of changes).

About the 8 July 2002 UAAG 1.0: I wanted to highlight one more change: checkpoints 1.2 and 9.6 now focus on event types rather than individual event handlers. 
This change is the result of discussions with the DOM WG. Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)
