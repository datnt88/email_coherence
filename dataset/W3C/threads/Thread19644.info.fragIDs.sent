<s> Thot has been designed to manage structured documents and it's a good candidate to provide SGML tools.  </s>
<s> But Thot syntax is not the SGML syntax and Thot uses Structure schemas written in language S instead of SGML dtds.  </s>

<s> I guess that you use the Java version isn't it ?  </s>
<s> The java version, when interrupted shows amount of HTML code which is available when stopped.  </s>
<s> If empty it displays an empty page, this should be improved.  </s>
<s> This behavious is related with back and forth since when looking for next/previous document, if the current one didn't finished to load, it is interrupted, hence the white page.  </s>
<s> For some reason, sometimes, the next or previous document is not loaded when requesting a series of next and/or back actions.  </s>
<s> and you end-up with a white, empty page ... This is a matter of synchronizing HTTP request initiated from C code with the actual fetching done in the Java V.M.  </s>
