<s> Hi, I am just wondering whether Amaya already supports UTF-8 character encoding or whether it is planned to support it in the near future.  </s>
<s> I checked the documentation and the mailing list archive, and UTF-8 doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the info.  </s>

<s> Hi, We undertake to support _Unicode_ not UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Actually, UTF-8 is used to store data in files.  </s>
<s> To process any kind of data (UTF-8, ISO-Latin*, ...) we need another internal encoding and procedures to convert, for instance, from UTF-8 to our internal representation of characters and vice-versa.  </s>
<s> I can't bet you that everything will be ready by the end of this year because we plan to support Unicode in the perspective of the software globalization.  </s>
<s> This needs more than the character encoding.  </s>
<s> In my opnion, even if everything is ready, we cannot release Amaya without a serious testing especially if 95% of the source code changes, nevertheless, we will try to do as soon as possible and as well as we can.  </s>
