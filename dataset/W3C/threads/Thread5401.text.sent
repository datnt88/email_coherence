Noting that nearly every Web user today relies on plug-in applications, the W3C fired off a passionate letter to the USPTO arguing that Eolas has no right to a patent that restricts access to the technology. 
So what does the W3C Patent Advisory Group (including its two Microsoft members), think of Microsoft's patent application for 'Displaying Plug-in Supplied Content in a Browser-Embedded Window', which the USPTO made public earlier this month? 
See the patent application at: http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220030226102%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20030226102&amp;RS=DN/20030226102 
When I looked over this pending Microsoft patent, I couldn't see where it would be used. 
Does anyone have some ideas of the application of this particular patent?

&amp;OS=DN/20030226102&amp;RS=DN/20030226102 While I can't offer an answer on behalf of the HTML Patent Advisory Group constituted to address the Eolas patent, I can address the way that the W3C Patent Policy works. 
Patent Advisory Group's are created when we become aware of a patent that is essential to a W3C Recommendation that is *not* available on royalty-free terms.[1] 
Our policy is focused on hte most serioius threats to interoperability. 
We do NOT create a PAG every time a patent is discovered that might read on a Web standard. 
The US Patent system being what it is, if we created a PAG for every patent allegedly related to the Web, we would have more PAGs than technical working groups. 
:-( New Recommendations developed under the W3C's new patent policy will offer more (but not complete) licensing certainly. 
Our policy requires that from now on, all who participate in the development of a W3C Recommendation agree to license any essential patent claims they hold on a royalty-free basis. 
FYI, our letter to the PTO said that we believed that there is a strong case that the patent is invalid and that that PTO should take action as quickly as possible to remove the damaging impact of the patent which should not have been issued in the first place. 
We did not, as you incorrectly suggest, challenge Eolas' right to hold a patent in general on Web technology.

What I would suggest is that the public may be less inclined to participate in this discussion after seeing the W3C leadership respond with a condescending FYI and by reinterpreting another's words instead of commenting on the USPTO's recent disclosure that Microsoft had a plug-in patent of its own in the works when it sought the W3C's support back in August. 
I certainly didn't mean to be condescending. 
As I understood you original note, you would like W3C to do something in particular about the particular patent application you cite. 
My response was simply to explain when we are or are not likely to look at a given patent. 
We're most concerned about patents that are actually being used to block compliance with W3C Recommendations, as Eolas is doing. 
If I've missed something, please clarify.

Since Microsoft's unsuccessful litigation and proposed IE changes seem to be playing a big role in driving the W3C's efforts (e.g., the unprecedented patent challenge) and schedule (e.g., no public call for prior art before the 301 filing) in the matter of the Eolas plug-in patent, I'm curious if the W3C and the PAG are concerned that the recently disclosed Microsoft plug-in patent application: 1. Doesn't seem to have been made public when Microsoft sought the W3C's support back in August (did MS disclose this to the W3C and PAG at the time?) 2. Seems to cover some of the same plug-in territory as Eolas (did MS provide the W3C and PAG with legal assurances that it will never be used to block compliance with W3C Recommendations?) 3. Might be used to counter any claims that Microsoft and others might try to make about plug-in patents not being considered innovative by someone "skilled in the art" In an earlier note (the W3C's Susan Lesch replied that she had no comment), I was also interested in some comments from the W3C and the PAG about feedback I got from the USPTO regarding the Eolas patent reexamination: 1. 
It was indicated that the prior art submitted by the W3C in October had already been submitted to the USPTO by another (unnamed) party (any idea if that's true and who the other party is?) 2. It was also indicated that because the reexam was ordered almost immediately after the USPTO received the duplicate prior art from the W3C, the public will be unable to contribute any new prior art for consideration as part of this reexamination (any idea if that's true or false?)
