<s> RDF Graph Patterns:: An RDF Graph Pattern is a description of a set of RDF subgraphs.  </s>
<s> If an RDF graph is in the set then it is said to match the graph pattern.  </s>
<s> (If anyone can define 'match' further without getting into defining the expressiveity of the pattern, do suggest something).  </s>
<s> c.f regular expressions and strings - and we get to define the expressivity of the graph pattern expression language.  </s>
<s> Example: Simple case:: RDF Graphs are defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/ in terms of RDF triples.  </s>
<s> An RDF triple pattern is an RDF Triple with the addition that subject, predicate or object can be a named query variable as well as the items defined in "RDF Concepts".  </s>
<s> An RDF Graph Pattern is a set of RDF Triple Patterns.  </s>
<s> A match is an association of RDF graph labels and the variables, such that  </s>
<s> substituting the labels for variables yields an RDF subgraph of the source  </s>
<s> RDF graph.  </s>
<s> In matching, if a query variable is used in more than one triple pattern, and/or more than once in a single triple pattern, it must be bound to the same label in any one query solution.  </s>
<s> Discussion:: This is the conjunctive form of graph patterns : its an RDF graph with some of the subject/predicate/object replaced by query variable (not bNodes of the graph).  </s>
<s> If we have disjunction in any form, then just a graph-with-variables isn't enough - we need a construction to express disjunction or (maybe) reify the query pattern.  </s>
<s> This does not say anything about restricting labels matched by value or lexical form.  </s>
<s> There may well be syntactic sugar to make this easier to write but it is equivalent to putting a variable (not part of the results for the variable binding case) into the graph pattern and, separately, writing an expression limiting the range of values for the label.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see a building block being a conjunctive graph pattern with a set of restrictions on labels.  </s>
<s> Andy  </s>
<s> Sound too general to me.  </s>
<s> For example, one can describe RDF graphs using reification, but I wouldnt want to count that as a 'pattern'.  </s>
<s> Suggest instead your first example as a suitable definition of  </s>
<s> pattern.  </s>
<s> That would be my definition, not an example.  </s>
<s> That should be part of the definition of 'substitute for a variable'.  </s>
<s> It kind of falls out of he way that RDF graphs syntax is defined in terms of sets rather than as expressions.  </s>
<s> Or think of it as a set of query graph patterns.  </s>
<s> True, but we could accommodate that into this definition of pattern by allowing 'variables' to be more highly structured things, like describing sorted quantification as quantification over sorted variables.  </s>
<s> Sounds about right to me, though I think we need to be very careful to describe those restrictions appropriately.  </s>
<s> One kind of useful restriction might be to a datatype, to constrain literal bindings (?). Pat  </s>

<s> I didn't mean that only patterns describe a set of subgraphs but I take your point.  </s>
<s> What about variable length paths e.g. ?x - p * - ?y (if we want to have them of course).  </s>
<s> A suitable defn os set membership might be OK but it seems  </s>
<s> a bit contorted.  </s>
<s> (A whiteboard at WWW would sort this out)  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Just to check I understand here: we then need operators to pick out the parts of the variables: e.g. lang(?x) to get the lang tag  </s>
<s> (minor question: what is the type of a lang tag?  </s>
<s> String?).  </s>

<s> Well, I'd call that a special kind of variable, but I see that it doesnt fall under that definition.  </s>
<s> OK, here's a second try.  </s>
<s> An RDF graph pattern is defined relative to a set of variable types and binding mappings, and is some entity which may contain some number of variables and which yields an RDF graph when a binding mapping is applied to those variables.  </s>
<s> Variables of a given type may be restricted to certain kinds of binding.  </s>
<s> A simple example is an RDF graph in which some URIrefs have been replaced by variables, and a binding mapping takes a variable to a URIref or literal.  </s>
<s> Yes, except I won't be there.  </s>
<s> Right, or maybe we can think of the variables as having internal structure (so the operators are just selectors).  </s>
<s> Whatever.  </s>
<s> It doesnt really have a type specified.  </s>
<s> I guess if it did have one it would have to be xsd:string, yes.  </s>
<s> Or maybe some special subclass of xsd:string.  </s>
