<s> Dear Sirs: I download Amaya 5.1 and try to use it.  </s>
<s> I go to yahoo and login my yahoo account.  </s>
<s> However, I could not.  </s>
<s> Yahoo reports that Amaya 5.1 does not accept cookie.  </s>
<s> Does Amaya 5.1 have cookie machanism feature?  </s>
<s> How do I turn it on?  </s>

<s> I am using Amaya to create MathML snippets for my mostly non-mathematical web pages.  </s>
<s> I noticed that the Greek Alphabet menu in the Amaya MathML editor also contains some handy math symbols, one of which is the approximately-equal symbol, located in the fourth row of the grid, immediately to the left of capital Greek "alpha".  </s>
<s> (It looks like a tilde stacked on top of a standard equals sign.) One of my "equations" is only approximately correct, so I tried to use this symbol for the first time today.  </s>
<s> Upon clicking the symbol, Amaya incorrectly writes this into the file as the character entity &amp;Congruent;, rather than as &amp;cong; (equivalent to &amp;#8773; or U+2245, according to Chapter 24 of the HTML 4.0 spec).  </s>
<s> The next time Amaya opens, it displays the incorrect expression as an identity symbol (this looks like an equals sign with a 50% bonus).  </s>
<s> Although I can fix the symbol by hand (and it thankfully stays fixed, once I correct it), I am hoping that the fix would be a "quickie" replacement of the &amp;Congruent; string with a &amp;cong; string in a table somewhere.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, IANAP (I am not a programmer), so I can't do it myself.  </s>
<s> I am running the Windows 95/98 precompiled binary, downloaded from the public Amaya site.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your consideration.  </s>

<s> i just tried to duplicate your problem -- but on my machine it places an &amp;cong; and displays as approx equal (with tilda) using win98 and amaya 5.1 (july 11) binary !!!  </s>

<s> There was a mistake in a conversion table.  </s>
<s> It's fixed now in the CVS base.  </s>
<s> It will be available with the next binary release.  </s>
