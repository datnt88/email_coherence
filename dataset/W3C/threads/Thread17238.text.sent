cryptic - which is a P1 checkpoint). 
But I can't see anything in WCAG that makes it compulsory to use the title attribute. 
The wording is 'title', but I interpret it to mean using the name attribute as well. 
Surely we should do both. 
You mean use title="" and saddle graphical-browser users with a tooltip that follows their cursor everwhere in the frame? 
Perhaps not, right? 
name="" is sufficient. 
Does anyone really think frames are a pressing issue these days? 
There are certainly cases where they are a valid design choice, but their usability and accessibility issues have caused them to fall out of favour. 
Meeting the WCAG requirement narrowly also means you meet it completely and functionally. 
Use name="" and Bob's your uncle. 
Oh, I almost forgot. 
The only browsers I know of that cannot understand frames are Lynx and W3M. 
That is *it*. 
We're still talking about this?
