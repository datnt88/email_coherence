Hello, I had problems installing new versions of Amaya since 6.4. 
The new version just would not start. 
This time I deleted the whole amaya directory after unistalling my old version and added back my old user-files one by one. 
I found this very irritating behavior: 
Amaya 7.1 (Win98) does not start up at all if the following file amaya.css 
is present in the user directory (C:\Programme\Amaya\users\Christoph in my case): 
The file contains one line: .comment 
p {font-size: smaller} 
At least this ist the line I found in my old amaya.css which causes the trouble. 
It is the ".comment p" which is relevant here. 
It should mean: "a P contained in any element of the class 'comment'." 
I am not shure, wether this is a correct css command, but even if it is not, Amaya should still launch and just ignore the css file.

"..comment p" is not a valid selector. 
When I test it, Amaya reports an error and doesn't crash.

Well, I am sorry, that was a stupid typo. 
It sais ".comment p" 
When I test this in an style-element within a document header, amaya does not report any parsing error. 
So I assume it ist correct. 
The phenomenon is not restricted to the class "comment" and the paragraph-element. 
It does the same with ".peter li". 
If the style definition is in the style-element in the document header this works fine. 
If the style definintion is put in amaya.css 
amaya does not start. 
This means that calling amaya.exe 
does not do anything visible on the GUI. 
It does some HD-rumble the fist time but amaya is not present in the taskmonitor. 
I hope this description is comprehensible, 
Happy Xmas! Christoph

I made the same test on my Windows box and it does the same thing in both cases. 
I suspect a trouble when downloading the file. 
Could you check with a pure ftp application: ftp ftp.w3.org 
Yes it is but the phenomenon not. 
Happy holiday season Irene.
