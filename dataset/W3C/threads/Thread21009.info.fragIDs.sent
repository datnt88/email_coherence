<s> Hello, I had problems installing new versions of Amaya since 6.4.  </s>
<s> The new version just would not start.  </s>
<s> This time I deleted the whole amaya directory after unistalling my old version and added back my old user-files one by one.  </s>
<s> I found this very irritating behavior:  </s>
<s> Amaya 7.1 (Win98) does not start up at all if the following file amaya.css  </s>
<s> is present in the user directory (C:\Programme\Amaya\users\Christoph in my case):  </s>
<s> The file contains one line: .comment  </s>
<s> p {font-size: smaller}  </s>
<s> At least this ist the line I found in my old amaya.css which causes the trouble.  </s>
<s> It is the ".comment p" which is relevant here.  </s>
<s> It should mean: "a P contained in any element of the class 'comment'."  </s>
<s> I am not shure, wether this is a correct css command, but even if it is not, Amaya should still launch and just ignore the css file.  </s>

<s> "..comment p" is not a valid selector.  </s>
<s> When I test it, Amaya reports an error and doesn't crash.  </s>

<s> Well, I am sorry, that was a stupid typo.  </s>
<s> It sais ".comment p"  </s>
<s> When I test this in an style-element within a document header, amaya does not report any parsing error.  </s>
<s> So I assume it ist correct.  </s>
<s> The phenomenon is not restricted to the class "comment" and the paragraph-element.  </s>
<s> It does the same with ".peter li".  </s>
<s> If the style definition is in the style-element in the document header this works fine.  </s>
<s> If the style definintion is put in amaya.css  </s>
<s> amaya does not start.  </s>
<s> This means that calling amaya.exe  </s>
<s> does not do anything visible on the GUI.  </s>
<s> It does some HD-rumble the fist time but amaya is not present in the taskmonitor.  </s>
<s> I hope this description is comprehensible,  </s>
<s> Happy Xmas! Christoph  </s>

<s> I made the same test on my Windows box and it does the same thing in both cases.  </s>
<s> I suspect a trouble when downloading the file.  </s>
<s> Could you check with a pure ftp application: ftp ftp.w3.org  </s>
<s> Yes it is but the phenomenon not.  </s>
<s> Happy holiday season Irene.  </s>
