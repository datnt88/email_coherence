All AU working group members, Before we publish the Techniques Document to TR we need consensus on a number of issues. 
Could everyone please respond by Thursday the 13th. 
The issues are as follows: 1. Which Icons should we be using. 
To view the candidate icons please go to: follow the thread "Au Techniques: Icons" on the list. 
2. We need to resolve inconsistencies regarding advice on default alt-text, for this please follow the thread: "Au techs/ ATAG errata 3. We need agreement on the proposal to move techniques from 3.3 to 1.4, see thread " [AU Techniques] moving techniques for 3.3" 4. Does everyone agree with the proposed additional techniques relevant to conversion tools, see the thread titled "[AU techniques] Conversion tools" 5. We need agreement on the proposed rewording of the required terminology. 
See the thread "AU techs - change "[required]" and explain it" 6. 
Should we add the priority/conformance section? 
See thread: "AU techs ad priorities and conformance" Please make your opinion known by this Thursday. 
If I don't hear from you by noon on Thursday, I might follow up individually. 
Thanks Jutta All AU working group members, Before we publish the Techniques Document to TR we need consensus on a number of issues.

In particular I have not yet added to the table Jan's icons, available at 2. We need to resolve inconsistencies regarding advice on default alt-text, for this please follow the thread: "Au techs/ ATAG errata I stand by my proposal that 3.4 overrides 2.2 if necessary. 
3. We need agreement on the proposal to move techniques from 3.3 to 1.4, see thread " [AU Techniques] moving techniques for 3.3" I support moving these 4. Does everyone agree with the proposed additional techniques relevant to conversion tools, see the thread titled "[AU techniques] Conversion tools" I do 5. We need agreement on the proposed rewording of the required terminology. 
See the thread "AU techs - change "[required]" and explain it" I stand by my original proposal 6. 
Should we add the priority/conformance section? 
See thread: "AU techs ad priorities and conformance" I think we should. 
(number 1 to come tomorrow) cheers Charles A favor the compromise set that I proposed on Dec. 6. 
I have come to agree that an exception should be added to 2.2 covering alternative equivalents. 
I have already agreed. 
This is tricky. 
From the partial list CMN provides, I'm already not sure about the inclusion of 1.4 (templates) and the exclusion of T0083 in 2.1. 
Email is probably not the best forum for this. 
What if we go technique by technique on our next call? 
I have already agreed. 
Agreed. 
It just makes the reason for all the priority statements more clear.
