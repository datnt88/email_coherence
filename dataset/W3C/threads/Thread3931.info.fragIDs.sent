FYI, one of my colleagues figured out that you can find P3P-enabled sites on google by searching for: allinurl: w3c p3p.xml 
Right now we're getting 801 hits.

I got something below, like 790, but it is missing all the data commissioner sites that I know are P3P enabled (and valid) Best, Rigo 
Yes, this is of course not a complete collection of P3P-enabled sites. 
It only catches sites that use the WKL and that are indexed by google. 
And it won't necessarily get all those sites due to the way the google indexing scheme works. 
Think of this number as a lower bound. 
My guess is the actual number of P3P sites is near two times this number.

That will not get any sites that don't have a prf in the wkl. 
Perhaps that's the reason?
