<s> LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Do not set limits on content or presentation; The problem is that it's incorrect: by requiring text equivalents for non-text elements we *are* making demands on content and presentation (alt text, captions, and longdescs all involve content, and they have to be presented somehow).  </s>
<s> I think we can delete this item and leave the remaining ones in place.  </s>
<s> Doing so might even have the benefit of making the difference between Levels 1 and 2 clearer.  </s>
