<s> == Key Benefits / Value Most of existing DBMS query systems are mostly centralized or subsumes some kind of central authority/control (and constraints) over their whole database architecture.  </s>
<s> What is needed over the Web is a system that allows fully federated queries over a bunch of distributed and  </s>
<s> heterogeneous sources/services/tables.  </s>
<s> Each source must be fully decoupled from the others; and must be able to retain its own workflow, schema and control/authority over its data.  </s>
<s> Each source only needs to be interfaced to the data federation through some kind of "proxy service" which allows to map its native data format or query-language to a common query/data format; and map results back and forth as requested.  </s>
<s> In other words, with a single query statement, the user can access and join tables located across multiple data sources without needing to know the source location.  </s>
<s> == Description The Web itself a good example of a federated system, providing dynamic direct and easy access to several different and heterogeneous information sources; search engines, image galleries, online travel agencies, online newspapers, online shops (e.g. Amazon [1]) are examples.  </s>
<s> Everybody can easily contribute to the Web by simply writing  </s>
<s> a piece of HTML and then publish it to a specific URI location.  </s>
<s> Links between similar pages can be easily set up without requiring any kind of centralized control and requiring few "integrity constraints" but naming "things" in a specific way; images can be as well be inlined inside pages by simply pin-pointing to their location URI.  </s>
<s> Then a specific Web browser application will take care of aggregating and assembling the hypertext in a unified view over a bunch of physically decentralized pages and related images.  </s>
<s> Similarly most of the dynamic data available into DBMS systems is available on the Web.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately while doing so most of the semantics of the original database fields/tables is lost and most of the DBMS usage benefits are somehow lost too [2].  </s>
<s> Generally only a limited set of search operations is made available to the end user a part plain free-text search.  </s>
<s> Web services are trying to overcome this problem with a more general XML based solution, by providing the user ad-hoc designed API to go beyond simple HTML human-interpretion.  </s>
<s> On the other side, such a technology did not proof to be general and flexible enough to solve most of the database federation problems yet.  </s>
<s> And this approach is suited but limited to a closed/vertical application domains.  </s>
<s> Differently, RDF provides a more general and powerful framework built on the Web for the Web - it is expected that people will start to annotate their pages/services with RDF descriptions allowing a third part application to transparently query/aggregate Web resources.  </s>
<s> Despite such a large set of solutions available to the user today, what  </s>
<s> is needed is a real federated query system which spawn several virtual database tables/resources/services. The query system must provide a user-friendly syntax and a standard API/protocol to express query statements over one or more distributed data sources - data sources might be Web pages, XML documents, DBMS, ad-hoc Web Services or any RDF metadata source.  </s>
<s> Each source might  </s>
<s> interface to the query federation system in many different ways [3-12].  </s>
<s> The query processing engine then has to split up the input query in several different sub-queries, to be run on each system, apply the constraints, join the results back and return to the user.  </s>
<s> Each result will then have to retain its full provenance/source information to allow the user to pose more queries in a second time eventually.  </s>
<s> In the  </s>
<s> easiest and most general case the query system will be simply provide a  </s>
<s> way to SELECT a certain number of fields/tables.  </s>
<s> Full DML functionality will be better tackled in the original sources using existing DBMS tools.  </s>
<s> If any of the sub-queries can not be run or fails to join in the main query, an empty result set is returned to the user.  </s>
<s> == Other === Notes This use cases subsumes some extensive/systematic query optimization, caching and other important technical/technological aspects not considered here.  </s>
<s> As well as the need to globally uniquely identify/name concepts/objects/relations and tables to make the model really fully  </s>
<s> federated (e.g. definition of a URI/URN scheme and resolution protocol).  </s>
<s> In relation to the DAWG work we are only/mostly interested  </s>

<s> While this is an important, and needed, application, this seems out of scope to me.  </s>
<s> Some particular service could provide a DAWG conformant interface to a virtual  </s>

<s> (with alberto technical mode on :)  </s>
<s> good point - but this would only be yet another specialized system, where your "DAWG conformant service" would kind of centralize the query functionality again, and it would need to provide a sort of "brokering service" to a specific broad range of repositories.  </s>
<s> And this is not  </s>
<s> exactly how the Web works to me - but basically yet another centralized SQL/DBMS query system, where the client is requested to ask to a specific service specific questions, while not the other way around.  </s>
<s> What about if in your case that "DAWG service" is down or not  </s>
<s> accessible?  </s>
<s> Is the query failing or the client has to piggy back to some alternative/spare service/solution?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the client instead be able to ask specific questions to specific distributed repositories directly?  </s>
<s> i.e. what I have in mind is a kind of HTML for data then you would need a DAWG aware client to interpret such a mark-up and doing the querying/aggregation job for you - ideally, like HTML pages (HTTP and the Web) allow today to seamlessly inline pictures in one unified view, there might be new Web browsers/clients/applications which might do the same for data.  </s>
<s> For example, imagine an HTML TABLE aggregating pieces of information taken from a bunch of URIs - perhaps using some XPath/XPointer to the the end of them to pin-point to specific nodes/values :)  </s>
<s> Er. the same would apply to only a kind distributed query systems, which you can control/interface to the federation and wrap around a "centralized" DAWG service.  </s>
<s> What I meant is more general...  </s>
<s> my only concern in the AR-2 use-case was to start to consider the possibility that DAWG queries might effectively spawn over the Web - and then we might need some little syntactic sugar to express such a federation bits into the query.  </s>
<s> (just to try to make you understanding what I meant) E.g. in an hypothetical extended RDQL syntax (almost playing here in the example) i.e. "get me all items titles and they geo-position" - where RSS items and their locations are sitting in two separated sources SELECT ?item  </s>

<s> It is clearer.  </s>
<s> Your example above also relates to ongoing work on named graphs that I find very interesting.  </s>
<s> However, I think that such issues  </s>
<s> are out of scope for DAWG for two reasons: 1.  </s>
<s> It really is an implementational detail how one service might provide a unified point of access to a federation of other services, and I don't think it is a sufficiently acute need in the general  </s>
<s> community to consume WG time to innovate a solution.  </s>
<s> 2. I believe that whatever solution DAWG recommends, it should be in sync with the new RDF specs -- and so adding support for named graphs seems too significant an extension for this first round.  </s>
<s> Of course, that's just my personal opinion, and the rest of the WG may disagree (certainly won't be a first ;-) Cheers,  </s>

<s> I'm not sure I've completely absorbed this use case, and it does seem like a stretch... but there does seem to be something novel to it: it motivates interoperability.  </s>
<s> In many of the use cases, it's not evident why we need lots of services to work the same way: as long as a particular client and server agree, they're happy.  </s>
<s> This case relies, pretty clearly, on lots of interoperable services.  </s>

<s> I agree that "Federated query" requirements are beyond what a query language is expected to provide, however just because a particular application won't be specifically addressed by a recommendation does not mean the use case can be ignored.  </s>
<s> Most naively, you could assume that such a federated knowledge base is really just translated to a very large collection of RDF.  </s>
<s> So call that collection task a part of the non-query application, and a spec which lets you query the resultant RDF is the part of the use case the DAWG rec.  </s>
<s> address.  </s>
<s> However, I think it's important that we keep in mind that this is not necessarily how applications will be architected.  </s>
<s> Actually gathering all that RDF into one place may be impractical or impossible.  </s>
<s> It might be more reasonable to break a query into smaller pieces and send each of them to different data source, coordinating only the way the results are collated together.  </s>
<s> To me, this use case brings up the point that there's a real use case for "large" queries, instead of requiring user combination of many small queries.  </s>
<s> If SQL allowed only querying of single tables, requiring users to perform their own joins (even if result formats made such joins easy to program), then it would be impossible to perform the kind of back-end optimization that makes relational database so useful.  </s>
