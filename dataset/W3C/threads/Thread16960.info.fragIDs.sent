<s> Dear Jan, On 25 February 2002 you answered a thread on Accessibility Legislation in Germany.  </s>
<s> In that you mentioned that a new law would be passed in May.  </s>
<s> Any update on this?  </s>
<s> I am also interested in the relevant legislation in France, Scandanavian Countries and, if anyone knows, the Far East (Taiwan, etc); so if anyone else can help on this (English versions only please.)  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance to all, and especially Jan. Simon  </s>

<s> Sounds odd, but has anybody put up webpages doing any sort of a summary of the various laws internationally re accessibility/disability rights?  </s>
<s> John  </s>
<s> I've found pages that relate to America, UK, and Australia but nothing that outlines Europe, Middle East, Far East, etc and that is where I am stuck.  </s>
<s> Increasingly I am being asked to comment on accessibility on an international scale and it is an area in which I am lacking knowledge.  </s>
<s> Following a search of the archives I came across Jan's email address and the replies to a question on German accessibility legislation but from there I have drawn a blank.  </s>
<s> The biggest problem that I am encountering is that the documents are in their native languages and I cannot translate them.  </s>
<s> Hence, the original question.  </s>
<s> If nothing exists on the Web about issues around the world, perhaps this is an area that the WAI and particularly this list should look into?  </s>
<s> Cheers  </s>

<s> Sorry, can you help me finding it please.  </s>
<s> Is the German ADA in English?  </s>
<s> TIA Jens Germany  </s>
<s> and there it's in German haven't found an english one yet  </s>
<s> It would be good to report new resources you find so they can be included on the WAI policies page: Patrick  </s>
<s> Simon, thank you!!!!  </s>

<s> I wouldn't rely too much on the resources/pages listed under the UK section - they are horrendously out of date (and my offer to update them has been ignored).  </s>
<s> martin.  </s>
<s> Just to clarify, my comment was in reference to the W3C WAI page, not the ICDRI site, which as Simon says, is excellent.  </s>
<s> I have found that many resources are, unfortunately, woefully out of date...  </s>
<s> I have found that this list is one of the best ways of aggregating information of this type and I would implore the WAI to update its information if accessibility is to be taken seriously on a global scale via the knowledge obviously available on this list - thanks those who have contributed to my thread.  </s>
<s> As Patrick suggests, any new resources should be forwarded onto the Policy area of the WAI site.  </s>
<s> I noticed that the Italian site has been updated at source but that the WAI page has not.  </s>
<s> As the Italian government is a partner of the W3C shouldn't a representative from the Italian government be forwarding changes to the relevant WAI co-ordinator so that updates happen with more regularity?  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm not wanting to shoot any messengers here.  </s>
<s> Without the WAI I would not be able to find this information at all, let alone know if it was up-to-date.  </s>
<s> It must be a nightmare for companines wishing to comply and not knowing if they are or, in some cases, need to and to what level of accessibility.  </s>
<s> btw, I have found that contacting the relevant governments and countries is the ideal way to get information and many countries have embassies in the geographical regions that this list covers, so go ask them as they may well be able to point you in the right direction.  </s>
<s> All I ask as a user of this list is that any information is shared so that we all benefit.  </s>
<s> Martin, an update on the UK perspective would be very much appreciated, WAI-approved or not.  </s>

<s> I also was forwarding resources to the W3C WAI for the Policy page, but gave up since the updates were not made.  </s>
<s> Another idea - some people might appreciate the global survey of accessibility laws and policies that are published in our new book "Constructing Accessible Web Sites" at www.icdri.org/constructing_accessible_web_site.htm.  </s>
