<s> Hi list, While preparing for the meeting tonight, I once again read guideline 2.1 about "Ensure that Interface Elements in the Content are Operable by Any User".  </s>
<s> Here it says: "If it's written to be used with a device that doesn't have a keyboard, but it could also be used by similar devices that do and it would work with their keyboard, it conforms.  </s>
<s> If it's written to work with devices that do not have keyboards and it can not be used by any other devices that do have keyboards, then it does not conform.  </s>
<s> (It cannot be accessed via keyboard.)"  </s>
<s> I have a few problems with this.  </s>
<s> I tried to see if these have been mentioned before but could not find it in the mailinglist archives.  </s>
<s> Feel free to point out any previous discussions to me if I'm just re-iterating something that has already been discussed at length.  </s>
<s> My questions are: * How available should a device with a keyboard interface be before you can say the functionality conforms?  </s>
<s> If a handy toolman creates a one-off device with a keyboard to help his blind cousin operate the functionality, a device with a keyboard interface exists but since it's not available to other people I would not say it solves anyone else's accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> * How is an author supposed to know about the range of devices out there that are meant to help people with disabilities?  </s>
<s> I have seen many assistive devices created for people with disabilities that I previously had no idea existed.  </s>
<s> Authors who don't know a lot about disabilities, may not be aware of devices that are created to allow people to operate functionality by keyboard.  </s>
<s> Do we require the authors to research whether these devices have been created?  </s>
<s> * How is the author supposed to keep up with what's out there?  </s>
<s> New devices are created every day.  </s>
<s> What if a device exists today, but is taken from the market tomorrow?  </s>
<s> Does the functionality conform?  </s>
<s> Do we require a constant effort to check whether there is still a keyboard operated device out there which can operate the functionality?  </s>
<s> I think it's to much to ask of the author to adept his web content on the basis of the existence of devices with a keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think we should drop the requirements for devices that do not have a keyboard.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we're saying you cannot write WCAG-compliant content for devices that do not have keyboards or variants with keyboards, which I think would be a very bad development.  </s>
<s> If we drop these requirements for keyboard-only devices, authors for those devices can still conform to WCAG.  </s>
<s> This will make hopefully stimulate the creation of accessible content for these devices.  </s>
<s> This will in turn increase the chance that someone will create a variant of the device with a keyboard interface.  </s>

<s> Hi Yvette - I am now really confused - what else is new.  </s>
<s> In my read and from previous discussions I think "we" are saying that content (at a minimum) must be operable via the use of a keyboard or its assistive technology (AT) equivalent (alternative keyboard interface).  </s>
<s> If someone has developed an alternative keyboard (assistive technology  </s>
<s> device such as Intellikeys, for example) an author would not have to know such a device existed so long as their web content was operable via a keyboard or its equivalent and the information it puts out.  </s>
<s> I think when we  </s>
<s> talk about a keyboard, we are talking about the functions of the keyboard (the information sent to the computer) and not what we envision when we look at a keyboard.  </s>
<s> An alternative keyboard can be hardware (Intellikeys, again) or software (on board keyboard).  </s>
<s> So long as the author's content can be accessed and operated by the information sent from the keyboard or other such interface, it seems that they'd comply.  </s>
<s> Yvette, let me know if I have understood you correctly.  </s>
<s> I will talk with you soon.  </s>

<s> Www.sesa.org  </s>
<s> I agree with you so far.  </s>
<s> The last example says "If it's written to work with devices that do not have keyboards and it can not be used by any other devices that do have keyboards, then it does not conform."  </s>
<s> To me the sentence means that if you develop content specifically for devices that have no keyboard, you cannot conform to WCAG.  </s>
<s> Because of your answer, I can see that my interpretation is probably not the way it was meant.  </s>
<s> Your interpretation makes a lot more sense :-) But if I interpret it like this, perhaps other people will as well.  </s>
<s> There is no plain language rewrite of these examples yet, but I think it would be wise to get rid of the ambiguity of the current wording since you and I have totally different interpretations of the same example... Yvette Hoitink CEO Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands  </s>
