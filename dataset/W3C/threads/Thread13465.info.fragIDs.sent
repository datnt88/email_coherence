<s> Since IE and Communicator do not position the CAPTION element consistently between them, authors have found other ways to create captions that look nice.  </s>
<s> suggestions include using nested tables or images to position the caption.  </s>

<s> The "align" attribute is legal, but deprecated in HTML 4.01.  </s>
<s> There is no "valign" attribute on the CAPTION element.  </s>
<s> And no discussion of the CSS2 property 'caption-side' and other positioning properties.  </s>

<s> Actually it seems from the article that both Explorer  </s>
<s> and Netscape get the caption wrong.  </s>
<s> align=left and align=right should put the caption on the left and right of the table, not on top.  </s>
<s> There is no need for nested tables to imitate the correct behavior.  </s>
<s> For example in case of align=left one can create the first cell to span a whole column, and put the text of the would be caption there.  </s>
<s> In http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html we find "align = top|bottom|left|right [CI] Deprecated.  </s>
<s> For visual user agents, this attribute specifies the position of the caption with respect to the table.  </s>
<s> Possible values: * top: The caption is at the top of the table.  </s>
<s> This is the default value.  </s>
<s> * bottom: The caption is at the bottom of the table.  </s>
<s> * left: The caption is at the left of the table.  </s>
<s> * right: The caption is at the right of the table."  </s>

<s> Furthermore, users want to position the caption not only consistently between the browsers but also consistently within the document.  </s>
<s> That may mean that you want it under the table just like the captions for images are laid out in your document.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to have means in CSS to be able to easily position an object relative to another object.  </s>
<s> Positioning with flow becomes complicated with several objects (when you don't want to structure mark-up according to layout needs).  </s>
<s> Or maybe I just haven't found the right example of how to do it.  </s>
