EOWG: We will not be meeting this Friday, Dec 17, due to too many conflicting meetings and proposals. 
Please be on the lookout however for material on the mailing list from Wilson Craig, for review and comment. 
The next two Fridays are not good for meetings due to upcoming holidays. 
That puts our next meeting at Friday, January 7, 1999.

All: The following is a draft of a statement that would be used to introduce assistive technology developers to the WAI and associated guidelines and techniques. 
It may be too short, too long, too obtuse or any number of other "toos." 
Any and all feedback is welcome. 
Providing accessibility to the World Wide Web requires cooperation among mainstream web browser developers, assistive technology vendors, web authors and developers of web authoring tools. 
The WAI offers guidelines and techniques to each of these groups. 
Much web content is developed using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is developed and published by the W3C. 
This content may be coded manually or generated using a number of different "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" (WYSIWYG) authoring tools. 
HTML is very flexible. 
Hence, a wide variety of methods may be used to develop pages with identical visual content. 
WAI Authoring Guidelines provide web authors with a set of standards and techniques for creating accessible sites. 
Authors who follow these guidelines will in no way compromise the visual appeal of their web sites, but ensure that their sites will work with a variety of assistive technologies. 
WAI User Agent Guidelines are divided into two groups: those pertaining to independent users agents such as web browsers and those that apply to dependent user agents such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and self-contained speech-based browsers. 
Assistive technology vendors benefit not only by adhering to the dependent user agent guidelines, but by being aware of all other guidelines as well. 
For example, one of the most compelling problems with providing access to web sites regards the use of tables. 
This HTML construct is used both to organize pages into columns and to deliver tabular data. 
If a browser developer develops the ability to interpret HTML so that it renders tabular content in a certain way, assistive technology developers benefit by knowing what that will be. 
Similarly, if the WAI proposes certain techniques to authors who want to label the elements of the table so that the browser can implement this interpretation, assistive technology vendors should support this method of coding a table. 
Supporting guidelines developed by the WAI serves both to raise awareness of the standards and to ensure that others following the guidelines are reinforced and supported in their work. 
Cooperation among those for whom guidelines are developed allows ease of development for mainstream and assitive technology developers and ease of use for people who disabilities accessing the limitless information available on the Web.

WC:: "The following is a draft of a statement that would be used to introduce assistive technology developers to the WAI..." WL: Where and by whom would this be used? 
Are there AT developers who haven't been properly introduced? 
Some of them are W3C members, others are on the Working Groups. 
I guess I feel that the home pages of W3C/WAI are already a reasonable introduction so: what are we to comment on here? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
William, this is what I understood Judy to have requested at the last telecon. 
Was I mistaken?

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Hi Wilson... As I recall, the rationale for you "volunteering" to write this introduction went something like this: "There are guidelines for content developers, guidelines for browser developers, guidelines for authoring tool developers, but nothing specifically aimed at assistive device developers, so it might be a good idea to spin an introductory blurb that would engage that group." 
I hope you will correct me if I have the sense of it wrong. 
One point that bothers me is that you appear to use the phrase "assistive technology vendors" interchangeably with "assistive technology developers" and I think you should stick exclusively to the latter. 
(If you are looking for a synonym, try "AT maker" or "AT creator".) While I am not quite a certain as William Loughborough that developers of Assistive Technology are as well educated about the W3C/WAI as they ought to be, I would hope that at least the ones developing AT to use with the Web are. 
I do agree however this introduction may hard to place in the growing WAI 
"background information" library. 
Was this project struck with the goal of eventually having "entry-portals" for target audiences (e.g. AU developers, UA developers, etc.) that would list or highlight such information and resources that are of immediate interest to that audience? 
If so, then "target-specific" introductions are valid.

Looks like a good start to me. 
You might like to separate Web Content Guidelines, which are about what authors need to do, from Authoring Tool Guidelines, which are about Authoring Software (and where we would appreciate some AT developer involvement, particularly as we move into an implementation techniques and review phase ;-) I think the HTML paragraph (second paragraph) belongs with the example about tables.

Response in JRG: 
JRG: The user agent guidelines only really talk about "mainstream" user agent technology. 
There is no longer any conformance statement for "assistive technologies". 
Although it would be interesting look at conformance it an assistive technology in combination with a "main stream" user agent technology satisfied all the checkpoint for speech or braille rendering.

Wilson, No, you're not mistaken. 
Thank you for getting this started, and for giving it to the group for feedback. 
In part (2) "EO Comments on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines" of our last meeting, on December 3rd, http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/1999/1203-EOWG-min.html we asked Wilson if he'd volunteer to do an info piece/ intro to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, for assistive technology developers. 
He agreed to, and, given that we didn't provide much guidance on how to do this, I think it's a good start. 
I also think that Chuck Letourneau, in his follow-up mail on this thread, places this correctly: 
In other words, I think we can look at this as an exploratory piece for creating some customized-intro materials for different audiences, and eventually making those part of various entry-portals into the WAI site. 
It would be interesting to see what we could do in about 1/4 the amount of text -- so that people would be doing less reading and more selecting of resources to follow. 
Anyone want to experiment with this another round?
