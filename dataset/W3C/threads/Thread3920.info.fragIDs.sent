<s> [P3P]: Beyond HTTP P3P Task Force Report 18 April 2003 $Revision: 1.17 $ on $Date: 2003/05/27 22:32:09 $ GMT Comments are inline:  </s>
<s> [P3P]: Beyond HTTP P3P Task Force Report 18 April 2003 Introducing A Web Application Scenario An interesting/difficult requirement for Web applications is that of initial data solicitation under a privacy policy and subsequent delegation/propagation of the solicited data under the policy.  </s>
<s> Our scenario is inspired by: * [24]S030 Third party intermediary scenario of the [25]Web Services Architecture Usage Scenarios [WSAUS], and * The [26]IETF Provision Registry Protocol's (PROVREG) privacy scenario Our scenario is not intended to be a completely accurate representation of real world requirements, nor does our document necessarily provide a satisfactory solution.  </s>
<s> Instead, this scenario is intended to be sufficiently represenative to serve our primary purpose of exploring generic Web application privacy issues and providing recommendations towards [P3P] reuse in that context.  </s>
<s> Scenario Definition Quoting from the [27]PROVREG Charter: Administration of Domain Name Service (DNS) registration increasingly distinguishes between the operation of a "back-end" registry data base service for registrations, versus "front-end" support services by registrars who interact with registrants and with the registry.  </s>
<s> Especially for various Top-Level Domains, the desire is to permit multiple registrars to share access to the database.  </s>
<s> Conversely, there is a desire to allow a registrar to access multiple registries via the same protocol, even if the registries differ in operational models.  </s>
<s> This is a great example.  </s>
<s> We should leverage it for the Web Services Architecture Usage Scenarios document.  </s>
<s> Soliciting Data from the User and Referencing Policies In our scenario, information is solicted from the [34]User by the [35]Soliciting Service so as to register the user's domain name.  </s>
<s> This section describes how a policy can be made known to the user agent.  </s>
<s> [[36]Section 2, P3P] provides four mechanisms for indicating the privacy policy of a site, the policy reference file 1. may be located in a predefined "well-known" location, or 2. a document may indicate a policy reference file through an HTML link tag, or 3. a document may indicate a policy reference file through an XHTML link tag, or 4. through an HTTP header.  </s>
<s> In our scenario, the Soliciting Service has a P3P privacy policy at the following URI: href='http://registry.example.com/P3P/PolicyReferences.xml' [37]Adopting applications that rely upon a data format other than [XHTML] to solicit information SHOULD support the first (well known location) and fourth (HTTP header) mechanisms; [38]adopting applications MUST NOT ever (mistakenly) release information to an application it is not familiar with on the basis of [P3P] mechanisms that it is familiar with.  </s>
<s> [39]Adopting applications MAY provide a means of associating a policy reference file with their own format.  </s>
<s> I think that for Web services, the policy (or the link to a policy reference file) should be expressed as a feature.  </s>
<s> Features are the extensibility mechanism of SOAP 1.2[55].  </s>
<s> The Web Services Description WG is working on their description and the Web Services Architecture WG is evaluating their role in the overall architecture.  </s>
<s> Feature is basically a functionality which can be expressed in different ways.  </s>
<s> In this case, the policy / policy reference would be carried by the SOAP message: - inside the envelope.  </s>
<s> - by the binding: - an RFC2822 header for an email transfer.  </s>
<s> - an P3P's HTTP header when using HTTP.  </s>
<s> - other means.  </s>
<s> Associating with an (Optional) WSDL Description An optional feature a Web service is to offer potential clients a [WSDL] description of its capabilities prior to interaction.  </s>
<s> Or, it might list itself in a directory [UDDI] such that user agents can peruse a description in order to select the most appropriate service.  </s>
<s> An obvious question in these circumstances is should a privacy statement be included in a [WSDL] description or [UDDI] entry?  </s>
<s> This would certainly be useful to web service clients that want to select services on the basis of a privacy practice.  </s>
<s> WSDL 1.2 has a mechanism to express features.  </s>
<s> If you were defining such a P3P feature, it would define what to express (the properties of  </s>
<s> the feature) in WSDL 1.2 (e.g.a URI reference, etc.).  </s>
<s> See [56] for the  </s>
<s> description of features.  </s>
<s> Registries would most likely refer to the service description and you would get that information for free.  </s>
<s> Transferring Data to a Third Party The Movement of Information In an intermediary scenario, data (defined broadly to include service privacy privacies, and personal information and privacy preferences) may move in many directions between the parties of the transaction.  </s>
<s> There are numerous models of interaction between the participants and the flows of information.  </s>
<s> For example: * In [P3P], a user's information is solicited by providing it with a privacy policy, which the user's client evaluates in light of the user privacy preferences.  </s>
<s> While the released information must be redistributed in accordance with the p3p:recipient field, [P3P] itself is not necessarily used to mediate those subsequent interactions.  </s>
<s> A [P3P] interaction is one-to-one with a focus on the user solicitation.  </s>
<s> * In PROVREG, a privacy policy governs the interaction between services (one or more registrars and the final registry).  </s>
<s> While the information exchanged my include user data, the user solicitation is out of scope.  </s>
<s> * In EPAL ([47]Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language), "While [P3P] formalizes privacy promises to be advertised (i.e., business to consumer), EPAL formalizes privacy authorization for actual enforcement within an enterprise or for business-to-business privacy control."  </s>
<s> One can consider three variables with respect to the flow of information within a network: Direction of Flow In [P3P], policies flow to the user agent, preferences stay local to the user agent, and information flows to services.  </s>
<s> One can also conceive of an exchange in which a user publishes his preferences and services must agree to them, or user preferences accompany user information in its journey -- as we've also done in our example scenario via my:Privacy element.  </s>
<s> Points of Decision In [P3P], the user's agent (the point of decision) is typically his network client.  </s>
<s> However, one can also imagine a trusted network service acting as the user's agent (managing the user's identity, information and enforcing his preferences).  </s>
<s> In PROVREG and EPAL services themselves are exchanging policies and making decisions.  </s>
<s> Points of Aggregation A service which solicits information from a user for redistribution to other services might choose to first collect and combine the policies of its peers and represent the p3p:recipients as having the "same" policy, or it might ask for separate parcels of information under a different policy corresponding to each of the recipients which it transfers data to.  </s>
<s> This is right on target.  </s>
<s> The Scope of Layers and Bindings (HTTP and SOAP) Does the [P3P] policy belong at the SOAP level, or HTTP?  </s>
<s> In the majority of cases SOAP will be transported over HTTP, what happens if both collect data?  </s>
<s> Given that a higher level application will likely know its dependencies, but its dependencies will not know the characteristics of those using them: [49]Adopting applications MUST specify where relevant [P3P] statements can be found.  </s>
<s> We RECOMMEND that normative association (not including [WSDL] or [UDDI]) be limited to the higher/application layer.  </s>
<s> We RECOMMEND that a higher/abstract layer MAY include the privacy policy of layers it is dependent upon, but that lower layers SHOULD NOT represent the policies of higher layers.  </s>
<s> For example, an application that transfers data with SOAP over HTTP that uses cookies, SHOULD specify: 1. the [P3P] policy associated with SOAP is normative and includes the HTTP policy, or 2. there are distinct [P3P] policies associated with the SOAP and HTTP layers.  </s>
<s> Isn't this already the case with a Web server nowadays?  </s>
<s> The HTTP stack/server may have some logging policies different from the ones a CGI has, for example.  </s>
<s> Intermediaries Even before data makes it to the Service Provider and its p3p:Recipients, if any, the information might travel through various intermediaries in order to reach its destination.  </s>
<s> [[53]Section 1.1.3,  </s>
<s> P3P] speaks to these cases as follows: P3P policies represent the practices of the site.  </s>
<s> Intermediaries such as telecommunication providers, Internet service providers, proxies and others may be privy to the exchange of data between a site and a user, but their practices may not be governed by the site's policies.  </s>
<s> In addition, note that each P3P policy is applied to specific Web resources (Web pages, images, cookies, etc.) listed in a policy reference file.  </s>
<s> By placing one or more P3P policies on a Web site, a company or organization does not make any statements about the privacy practices associated with other Web resources not mentioned in their policy reference file, with other on-line activities that do not involve data collected on Web sites covered by their P3P policy, or with offline activities that do not involve data collected on Web sites covered by their P3P policy.  </s>
<s> This semantic continues to stand in circumstances "beyond HTTP."  </s>
<s> However, we may now make the following recommendation: 1. Adopting applications that want to ensure the privacy of user information SHOULD take steps to ensure that no information is released to a network intermediary that is not covered by its P3P policy.  </s>
<s> This may be expressed via policy (such as [SOAP] headers) or ensured via various end-to-end mechanisms such as session security (e.g., [TLS]) or document security (e.g., [XENC]).  </s>
<s> Do we need to say anything more about forwarding and active intermediaries?  </s>
<s> Should we define a "[54]P3P Policy for SOAP intermediaries" that only permits the data to be used for the "current purpose/admin and no retention" that SOAP intermediaries MUST use?  </s>
<s> Reagle prefers to rely upon the text above unless we are further pressed with actual use cases.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> There is something else which probably needs to be underlined.  </s>
<s> P3P reference policies for resources, whatever the operation on them is.  </s>
<s> With Web services, what the resource is is a little fuzzy (a car? the application in charge of selling cars?  </s>
<s> some state about the sale of a car?) and WSDL defines the interface to this target resource.  </s>
<s> The level of granularity here is probably the WSDL operation.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the comments Hugo!  </s>
<s> How is this done?  </s>
<s> I've read [55] and it's written in the abstract, and I've  </s>
<s> also looked at [56], but I'm not sure how to apply it.  </s>
<s> (Also, while we've been exploring various options, we also having been avoiding the "exotic" features unless there some cause to demonstrate them.)  </s>
<s> We've mocked up a header by which a sender can "ask" all intermediary nodes  </s>
<s> to also understand the privacy policies of the carried application data: env:Header xmlns='http://registry.example.com/2003/soap-header-p3p-extension.xsd' xmlns:env='http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope' Privacy env:role='http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next' env:mustUnderstand='true' But what does one have to do to represent it as a "feature"?  </s>
<s> Also, since we  </s>
<s> are not an application ourselves (but expect P3P to be used by "adopting applications") we presently can't limit this to any particular MEP.  </s>
<s> I'd expect such a header would be orthogonal to other MEPs and "features".  </s>
<s> So, for example, a UDDI registry would probably know how to pull information  </s>
<s> for its own puproses and translate it into UDDI syntax?  </s>
<s> There's nothing terribly novel in this case.  </s>
<s> But in your example, we didn't  </s>
<s> have the HTTP and the CGI presenting you with different policies.  </s>
<s> The policy associated with the HTTP was good for your interactions with the specified URI (e.g., the CGI).  </s>
<s> In SOAP, the recipient of the *transport*  </s>
<s> layer (the SMTP recipient or HTTP server the POST is sent to) might be  </s>
<s> different the the SOAP ultimateReceiver, right?  </s>
<s> Which brings me to the question, in SOAP, how do you identify the "ultimateReceiver"?  </s>
<s> What URI should the PolicyRef file refer to, the URI of its immediate transport counterpart (I don't think so), or the "ultimateReceiver" -- if you can identify that?  </s>
<s> I think this relates to my question above, and Patrick has explored this a bit.  </s>
<s> In our example, we associated it with the definition (my:Privacy is a child of the wsdl:definitions), are you recommending it be a child of the wsdl:operation element?  </s>

<s> * Joseph Reagle reagle@w3.org  </s>
<s> [2003-06-03 17:29-0400]  </s>
<s> Let me try to make this concrete.  </s>
<s> We could define the P3P feature, which indicates the policy for a service.  </s>
<s> Note that I am not sure that this is what you would want exactly since one could imagine: - the service pointing out where the policy reference file is for its different interfaces.  </s>
<s> - the requester giving a URI of the agreed upon policy for a request: this probably is useful in a delegation scenario (in your example,  </s>
<s> the registrar telling the registry what he agreed to) or if one could negotiate a privacy policy (the registrant is proposed 2 choices by the registrar: a 10% discount if he agrees to be spammed).  </s>
<s> - a policy reference document instead of a URI.  </s>
<s> - a privacy policy instead of a URI.  </s>
<s> So, anyway, in order to make things concrete, let's try to address the second case: expressing a URI to a P3P policy document.  </s>
<s> I think that it is more useful than expressing the URI to a policy reference since a WSDL description would already give a list of policies for each service.  </s>
<s> Again, this would probably be up for discussion.  </s>
<s> --8 ---- P3P feature - Name - Description The P3P feature is used to indicate the P3P policy governing the use of a service.  </s>
<s> - Properties The P3P feature defines a single property: Property name: Property type: xsd:anyURI The value of the http://www.w3.org/2003/06/16-p3pf/id property is the identifier for the P3P policy governing the use of the service.  </s>
<s> - Expressing the P3P feature  </s>
<s> When using the http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/ SOAP HTTP/1.1 binding, the P3P feature is expressed as an HTTP header as follows: P3P: policy=" URI-Reference "  </s>
<s> In this case the value of URI-Reference is the value of the Other bindings may define alternative ways of expressing the P3P  </s>
<s> Reference feature.  </s>
<s> If no alternative way has been defined, the feature and its property are expressed in the form of a SOAP header.  </s>
<s> [ Insert here the description of a SOAP header in the spirit of the one you used for a policy reference file.  </s>
<s> ] -- 8----  </s>
<s> Does it make things clearer?  </s>
<s> I think so.  </s>
<s> Well, I don't think that UDDI knows about features.  </s>
<s> Let's take the P3P feature again.  </s>
<s> A WSDL 1.2 description of a service with such a feature could be (this may be slightly inaccurate, but you will get the idea): feature uri='http://example.org/2003/06/16-p3pf/' property uri='http://example.org/2003/06/16-p3pf/id'  </s>
<s> With such a generic feature &amp; property mechanism, a registry would be able to express that the service has the following features, and if your implementation knows what the P3P feature is, it will be able to  </s>
<s> make good use of it.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... I think that I was confused.  </s>
<s> I think that a policy reference file is fine as a child of wsdl:definitions, but a reference to a policy file, i.e. a policy which would apply to an operation, would be more specific.  </s>
<s> Which makes me wonder: are policy reference file useful to Web services?  </s>
<s> With WSDL and something like a P3P feature, wouldn't the problem addressed by policy reference files taken care of?  </s>

<s> Hi Hugo, Thanks a lot for your explanation and clarification.  </s>
<s> May I ask one more question here.  </s>
<s> I apologize if I further confuse you by my misunderstanding... :-)  </s>
<s> Based on your description, I believe that I have a picture of how to define a "feature."  </s>
<s> Assume my understanding is correct.  </s>
<s> Then, it seems that the "feature" is an independent structure that can be applied/attached into UDDI, SOAP or even WSDL, am I correct?  </s>
<s> If I do not misunderstand it, how can I specify/attach the "feature" into UDDI, SOAP or even WSDL?  </s>
<s> Sorry that I am lazy to check the related specifications.  </s>
<s> In many cases, I do imagine that we may need a privacy policy at the level and then with some other privacy policies at the wsdl:operation/ level.  </s>
<s> Thus, we may have to do a logical "AND" between the privacy policies in two different abstraction levels.  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot,  </s>
<s> Patrick.  </s>
<s> * Patrick.Hung@csiro.au  </s>
<s> Patrick.Hung@csiro.au  </s>
<s> [2003-06-18 01:27+1000]  </s>
<s> Hmmm... the concept of feature is something abstract which originated in the SOAP Version 1.2 work and is in the process of being generalized to the Web services architecture.  </s>
<s> The definition of a SOAP feature is:  </s>
<s> More below.  </s>
<s> Let's take another simple example to try and illustrate this.  </s>
<s> Consider the simple "reliable" messaging.  </s>
<s> Its definition specifies what is meant by simple "reliable" messaging, e.g. have the receiver send a return receipt to the sender once it got the message, without caring about this return receipt getting lost.  </s>
<s> = SOAP 1.2 A SOAP module realizing the simple "reliable" messaging can then be specified.  </s>
<s> A SOAP module is:  </s>
<s> A SOAP Module is a specification that contains the combined syntax and semantics of SOAP header blocks specified according to the rules in 3.3 SOAP Modules.  </s>
<s> A SOAP module realizes zero or more SOAP features.  </s>
<s> So this specification would explain what SOAP header blocks would need to be inserted in the message and how they would need to be processed to implement this feature.  </s>
<s> I think that this answers your question about the relationship with SOAP.  </s>
<s> Note that this feature could be provided by a protocol binding.  </s>
<s> For example, HTTP has responses and therefore the HTTP binding would support this simple feature.  </s>
<s> For more details about SOAP 1.2 and features: = WSDL 1.2  </s>
<s> Then, for WSDL 1.2, a service may ask you to interact with it using this feature.  </s>
<s> In this case, the WSDL 1.2 description of this service would specify this with a piece of XML such as the one I showed for the http://example.org/2003/06/16-p3pf/  </s>
<s> feature, specifying the associated properties.  </s>
<s> This is how a feature would appear at the service description level.  </s>
<s> For more details about WSDL 1.2 and features: = Registry  </s>
<s> If you were querying a registry, chances are that the registry was populated directly from the WSDL 1.2 description.  </s>
<s> In this case, the registry will tell you that the service support the simple "reliable" messaging feature, since it found in the WSDL 1.2 description as explained above.  </s>
<s> I hope that this other simple example will shed more light on my more relevant P3P feature example.  </s>
<s> Oh, I see.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> I don't think we would want to use the HTTP binding though for our main case of the user and the registry.  </s>
<s> In that clase it's closer to end-to-end.  </s>
<s> The former [Processing Model] describes the behavior of a single SOAP node with respect to the processing of an individual message.  </s>
<s> BTW: Does that mean that header can only be relevant to a single node?  </s>
<s> I don't think so because it laters says, "Such header blocks can be intended for any SOAP node or nodes along a SOAP message path", so perhaps that "single SOAP node" is innapproriate?  </s>
<s> Regardless, of augmented our section on the Scope of Layers and Bindings (HTTP and SOAP) to cite the Features text from the SOAP spec since it coincides with our ealier recommendations:  </s>
<s> Adopting applications MUST specify where relevant P3P statements can be found.  </s>
<s> We RECOMMEND that normative association (not including WSDL or UDDI) be limited to the higher/application layer.  </s>
<s> We RECOMMEND that a higher/abstract layer MAY include the privacy policy of layers it is dependent upon, but that lower layers SHOULD NOT represent the policies of higher layers.  </s>
<s> For example, an application that transfers data with SOAP over HTTP and uses cookies, SHOULD specify: 1. the P3P policy associated with SOAP is normative and includes the HTTP cookie usage, or 2. there are distinct P3P policies associated with the SOAP and HTTP layers.  </s>
<s> Again, the Non-ambiguity requirement of ([P3P], section 2.4.1)  </s>
<s> MUST be respected, "Sites MUST be cautious in their practices when they declare multiple policies for a given URI, and ensure that they can actually honor all policies simultaneously."  </s>
<s> Furthermore, SOAP Features ([SOAP], secion 1.3) states that: The processing of SOAP envelopes in accordance with the SOAP Processing Model (see 2. SOAP Processing Model) MUST NOT be overridden by binding specifications.  </s>
<s> It is recommended that, where practical, end-to-end features be expressed as SOAP header blocks, so that the rules defined by the SOAP Processing Model can be employed.  </s>
<s> Hugo, thank you for this extensive (tutorial!) email!  </s>
<s> I still can't say I understand all of this Feature and WSDL stuff, but I  </s>
<s> think you have a very important point there.  </s>
<s> A Policy Reference file designates a (1) life time (expiration), (2) policies, (3) and set of paths for a web site (via INCLUDE and EXCLUDE) where those policies apply.  </s>
<s> Basically a set of URIs over which one does HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT) That makes lots of sense for browsing a web sites, but not so much for Web Service.  </s>
<s> In the Web Service case one will be doing port names (operations) as applied to a soap:address?  </s>
<s> In which case, a Policy Reference file isn't really needed.  </s>
<s> So we sort of have this, less formally, and we haven't given ita special "feature" URI...  </s>
<s> Yes, I think so.  </s>
<s> So in our scenario, we'd still want the Policy Reference file for the XForms/XHTML aspect, but not for the registrar to registry aspect.  </s>
<s> Patrick, is your understanding sufficient that you have a sense of what changes we could make to our document?  </s>
<s> I still need to keep thinking it through for myself....  </s>
<s> So one alternative is to reference the policy file directly for web services rather than the policy reference file.  </s>
<s> Another alternative is to use the extension mechanism to create a more appropriate type of reference for web services inside the policy reference file.  </s>
<s> This reference would designate an appropriate scope for a policy that is applicable to web services.  </s>
<s> I don't know enough about what I am talking about here to know which would be preferable... but I would like you to consider both possibilities.  </s>
<s> Lorrie  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your explanation, Hugo!  </s>
<s> Hi Joseph, I can't say that I am understanding sufficient...  </s>
<s> However, I will study the SOAP and WSDL "features" and do more thoughts.  </s>
<s> In the first cut, we ***may*** have to revise those SOAP and WSDL examples by using "features" or make the "features" version as another option in our document.  </s>
<s> I will be out of office/town and in California from June 22 to July 2. That's why I may not be able to check e-mails regularly.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I have bring enough relevant materials with me for reading during the trip.  </s>
