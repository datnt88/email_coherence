Suggestion for 3.1.2 
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html) "identify a "page selection" which includes at least one of each different type of page on the site, and all top pages or entry pages to the site" Identify a "page selection" which includes at least one of each different type of page from the site including all top pages or entry pages to the site. 
Also include selections from the major "subsites" and "subsections", especially where these have a different look-and-feel or design, or have been created by different developers or teams.

"Page selection" should also include pages that are generated by scripting from a database, which would cover sites that are entirely database driven, as well as individual pages on a site that are generated on the fly as a result of a query to a database.

I sent this last night - not sure why it didn't go through - so I'm trying again.

Greetings, I asked around amongst various people concerned with the intranet/internet in our company. 
With regard to the term "page selection" the following remarks helped clarify for me what an employee might think about page selection. 
One concept concerned the selection criteria of Mission Critical. 
A page would be selected because it was Mission Critical to the business in order to generate sales. 
Roughly defined as what minimum number of pages do consumers have to hit in order to make a basic transaction. 
A second area involves risk. 
A page which consumers access to find out about company policies even though sales may happen without the public reading that page. 
Typically someone trying to meet such criteria might choose pages with a form, frames (navigational elements), image maps, dynamic pages with templates.

Database systems for producing content are authoring tools, and the work of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines working group was intended among other cases to provide a specification that these systems could be tested against. 
Since each large system is essentially a special case of an authoring tool, it makes sense to evaluate such systems against ATAG (although that includes some fairly significant WCAG evaluation of result pages).
