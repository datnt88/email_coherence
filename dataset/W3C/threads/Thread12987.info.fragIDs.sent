<s> "Page selection" should also include pages that are generated by scripting from a database, which would cover sites that are entirely database driven, as well as individual pages on a site that are generated on the fly as a result of a query to a database.  </s>

<s> Greetings, I asked around amongst various people concerned with the intranet/internet in our company.  </s>
<s> With regard to the term "page selection" the following remarks helped clarify for me what an employee might think about page selection.  </s>
<s> One concept concerned the selection criteria of Mission Critical.  </s>
<s> A page would be selected because it was Mission Critical to the business in order to generate sales.  </s>
<s> Roughly defined as what minimum number of pages do consumers have to hit in order to make a basic transaction.  </s>
<s> A second area involves risk.  </s>
<s> A page which consumers access to find out about company policies even though sales may happen without the public reading that page.  </s>
<s> Typically someone trying to meet such criteria might choose pages with a form, frames (navigational elements), image maps, dynamic pages with templates.  </s>

<s> Database systems for producing content are authoring tools, and the work of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines working group was intended among other cases to provide a specification that these systems could be tested against.  </s>
<s> Since each large system is essentially a special case of an authoring tool, it makes sense to evaluate such systems against ATAG (although that includes some fairly significant WCAG evaluation of result pages).  </s>
