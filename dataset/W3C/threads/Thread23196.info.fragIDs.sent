<s> Can someone tell me if it's possible to insert javascript code as an element's attribute's value?  </s>
<s> That is, I create a select element; I also create some option elements, appending each one as a child to the select element as I create them.  </s>
<s> To the select element, I add an attribute called "onchange", and it's value is: "alert('option changed')"; that is, I do:  </s>
<s> var e = document.createElement("select");  </s>
<s> e.setAttribute("onchange", "alert('option changed')");  </s>
<s> I bring up the page on my browser, I do see the pulldown, but when I change the option, I don't get the javascript alert like I expect to.  </s>
<s> Am I doing this correctly?  </s>
<s> If not how can I do this?  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> You want to use addEventListener instead of setAttribute, at a guess.  </s>

<s> Hi Boris, thanks for the help.  </s>
<s> It worked- kinda.  </s>
<s> It seems IE 5+ doesn't support addEventListener.  </s>
<s> IE5+ has got its own thing called attachEvent (found that online).  </s>
<s> The whole point of me using DOM in the first place was so that I woun't have to test for browsers.  </s>
<s> But now it seems I have to.  </s>
