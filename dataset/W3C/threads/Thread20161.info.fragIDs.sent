<s> Hi, Could you first verify that the NumLock or the CapsLock are not active.  </s>
<s> They could be used as key modifiers.  </s>
<s> You can also start "xev" to analyse events generated by "Shift A". XLookupString should give 1 characters: "A" Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> Problem is on my keyboard.  </s>
<s> I have Slovene keyboard and if i change keymode 92=Sys_Req to X386Sys_Req than NumLock working and Amaya too :). Thanks, Mitja  </s>
