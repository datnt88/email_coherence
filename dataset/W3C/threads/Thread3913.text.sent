When looking over this sheet with ppl on my team we found 2 more issues in the translations. 
They are around pseudo-analysis and development being almost the same definition and the definition of the computer category sounding too negative. 
I have proposed new definitions in the notes column of the attached file. 
Please give me any feedback you have on these. 
Jeremy Epling Windows - Privacy and Trust UX Whoops, I forgot to attach the file. 
The comments I made are in red.

Jeremy Epling Windows - Privacy and Trust UX Thanks for taking the time to look at the matrix again. 
Differentiating between pseudo-analysis and develop is tricky. 
Both are for research. 
Both are not supposed to identify the individual. 
The conceptual difference is that pseudo-analysis involves the creation of a (pseudonymous) profile of an individual (and thus lends itself to researching things that require tracking an individual's use of a service, for example), while develop does not involve the creation of a profile. 
So that's why I used the term "record identified with you." 
The new wording that you propose for develop could describe pseudo-analysis equally well. 
Any other ideas? 
For computer you proposed: "Information about the computer you are using. 
Such as its hardware, software, or internet address." 
If you change the . 
to a , and make it "Information about the computer you are using, such as its hardware, software, or internet address." 
I would be happy with that.
