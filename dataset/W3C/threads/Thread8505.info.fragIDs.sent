<s> I've been mulling this over and studying the standards starting with the basic XML 1.0 standard.  </s>
<s> Probably lots of members of this WG are very familiar with XML processing but perhaps what I say below will be helpful for others... No canonicalization makes sense for binary things.  </s>
<s> Binary things, like images or executables, can reasonable be expected to be truly fixed.  </s>
<s> The Minimal canonicalization we are defining (canonicalize character set and line endings) makes sense for text.  </s>
<s> Text comes in a variety of character sets and not uncommonly gets its line endings changed from platform to platform.  </s>
<s> Of course, if something is handled as binary, even though its text, you can avoid canonicalization.  </s>
<s> But if it is going to be interoperably processed as text, you would want at least somthing like Minimal canonicalization.  </s>
<s> The basic process of reading XML and presenting it to an application (whether from an external file or a buffer in memory) is herent in any XML processing and is destructive as far as information goes that XML considers insignificant.  </s>
<s> Very explicitly, attribute value white space is normalized (unless the attribute is declared as CDATA).  </s>
<s> In particular, all leading and trailing white space is stripped from attribute values and all internal runs of white space are converted to a single space.  </s>
<s> While I found it explicitly anywhere, XML experts seem to take it as axiomatic that attribute ordering is insignificant and that white space between items inside start/end tags is insignificant.  </s>
<s> The XML Infoset says that a CR-LF is converted to an LF as is a CR not followed by an LF.  </s>
<s> There are additional areas where significance gets more murky, like white space between elements, which in XSLT for example, is stripped unless you have specifically declared it to be preserved.  </s>
<s> Namespaces are also a somewhat murky area but XPath and other specs treat a namespace declaration as distributing its information across all child nodes unless they are shielded by another namespace declaration with the same prefix.  </s>
<s> What this means is that if you have a hunk of XML like Elementz=" a, b, c " a="a"xmlns:Prefix="data:1234"  </s>
<s> A 1 /A B  </s>
<s> C Prefix:m="n" /B /Element and you did any XML processing with it, it would be nonconformant (in the presence of a DTD declaration other than CDATA) not to convert the value of the z attribute to "a, b, c".  </s>
<s> And if would entirely reasonable to get an internal representation which, if you output it, was something like or a variety of amounts of normalization between this and the input.  </s>
<s> All would be conformant to the XML rules.  </s>
<s> The above isn't the canonical printout according to the current W3C  </s>
<s> canonical XML proposal but will give you an idea of the normalization  </s>
<s> that can occur to the internal data structure just from reading XML for normal conformant XML processing.  </s>
<s> Sure, if you have XML but are treating it as binary data, you many not need any canonicalization.  </s>
<s> And if you have XML and treat it just as text, you may need only minimal canonicalization.  </s>
<s> But if you are going to process it as XML and want signatures over it that are interoperable, I don't see how you can escape the need for XML canonicalization.  </s>
<s> SignedInfo is XML, is signed, and I would think we would want those signatures to be interoperable.  </s>
<s> Thus I conclude that at least the default and quite possibly the fixed canonicalization for SignedInfo must be an XML canonicalization.  </s>
<s> Because we control the syntax of SignedInfo, we can make additional choices.  </s>
<s> Although I'm not proposing any decision at this time, we do not make any use of XML Comments in SignedInfo, for example, so if we decided that it was reasonable never to do so and if we also decided there was utility in allowing unsecured comments to be sprinkled into and removed from SignedInfo, we could specify a default XML canonicalization (or transform if you are worried about my use of the c14n word stepping on the toes of the W3C official c14n effort) that stripped out all XML comments.  </s>

<s> Systems are already being built based on the PKCS#7 detached signature format.  </s>

<s> Needless to say the chances of someone taking a working production system  </s>
<s> and then introducing an unnecessary transformation to sort all the XML attributes into alphabetical order before verifying a signature is small.  </s>
<s> If you really MUST support the functionality proposed, canonicalization (which has a well defined meaning in computer science) is NOT the way to achieve it.  </s>
<s> Instead of canonicalization, specify a syntax constraint.  </s>
<s> This might state for example that the signed octets presented were presented with null space eliminated, tags fully epanded and attributes sorted into alphabetical order.  </s>
<s> The only functional difference between this approach and the one you propose is that the signature on the syntax constrained text would fail if it were to be passed through this 'noisy channel' that you keep claiming exists (although I have never known a noisy channel gratuitously re-order bytes).  </s>
<s> On the processing side such a syntax constraint would require minimal code, a few lines to check that each attribute was presented in order, no unexpected whitespace appearing etc.  </s>
<s> A syntax constraint is acceptable, a c14n requirement is not.  </s>
<s> If we continue to keep re-opening this issue I don't think consensus will be reached.  </s>

<s> While I suppose we could still supress the XML DSIG v1 namespace, it doesn't really seem worth it to make such a special case when as soon as there is a v2 the namespace and prefix will have to spring back into presence in the canonicalized form.  </s>

<s> It's kind of tedious but it all works fine as long as there is a canonical representation defined.  </s>
<s> I don't think DER had much effect on the reputation of ASN.1 but to the extent that it had an effect, it was to improve its utility and reputation.  </s>
<s> The canonical representation of ASN.1 provided by DER made interoperable digital signatures over ASN.1 data practical for non-trivial systems just as XML canonicalization is required to make interoperable digital signatures over XML practical.  </s>
<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> There were quite a few motivations for the design of XML but I don't believe they were particularly worried about digital signatures during that design process.  </s>

<s> Thanks Don, I have been looking at James Clark's canonicalization code (which is in C). Regarding IBM's XML Canonicalization code, could you 1.

<s> I never said a word about certificates.  </s>
<s> I had nothing to do with the PKI or certificate part of the SET software I was working on.  </s>
<s> When ever my code got down to certificates or CRLs or BCRLIs, I just called code designed and implemented by someone else which did all the certificate parsing and key caching.  </s>
<s> In my mesage I talked only about messages in SET, a reasonable exmple of a complex protocol but using ASN.1 instead of XML.  </s>

<s> The creating, clean binary channel handling, and processing of certificates is probably much more like a document application than a protocol application as I have been using those terms.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I'll try to clarify it.  </s>
<s> "print" = deliver.  </s>
<s> Right, with your proposal, you need XML canonicalization at the signer.  </s>
<s> See above re print time.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, the definition of XML and the actual SAX and DOM interfaces that almost everyone uses will sometimes break your signer imposed canonicalization and thus break the signatures unless canonicalization is also implemented at the verifier.  </s>
<s> For soemthing to preserve the canonicalization, it would have to use some specially crafted parser, which I don't think it is entirely unjustified to call "home-brew".  </s>
<s> There were arguments over this previously in this WG.  </s>
<s> There wasn't a consensus on whether a fixed canonicalization algorithm was reasonable or what the defualt canonicalization algorithm should be for SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> As long as there isn't a WG consensus, the question is open.  </s>
<s> Under these circustances, it seems reasonable for me to think about it a bit more.  </s>

<s> I have a technical opinion.  </s>
<s> You have one also.  </s>
<s> Consensus?  </s>
<s> At this point, I think there is a rough consensus that Null, Minimal, and at least one XML canonicalization and application specified canonicalziations should be optionally available for data.  </s>
<s> But there isn't a consensus on whether canonicalization can be fixed, and if so at what, or defaulted, and if so to what, for SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> Donald  </s>
<s> FWIW, I believe we need to default to a particular canonicalization (on both the signer and verifier side.) The problem just doesn't look that tough to implement to me (attribute ordering, namespace substitution, etc.) Sure, some vendors will screw it up (an hopefully we won't screw up the spec), but applications can certify and recommend word processors, parsers, etc. for their purpose, just as they do with browsers now.  </s>
<s> Signatures either pass or fail, so certification should be relatively straight forward (it would be nice if a standards body tackled certification.) Of course, an application should be able to specify null or other canonicalization for its isolated (thus insulated) purpose.  </s>
<s> My problem is with the larger world.  </s>
<s> In the scenario I hope to be dealing with in a few years, an attorney would use a word processor to create and digitally sign an XML document for submission to the court.  </s>
<s> As a federal court, we don't believe we should dictate that an attorney use a particular word processor for a filing.  </s>
<s> We can, however, require that they follow reasonable standards (for example, a document that conforms to a particular DTD.) On the court side, I want to be free to choose or switch DOM-based XML parsers without fear of breaking all the signatures (incidentally, it would be very painful to use the "source" stream for this purpose, that is, DOM + some dual hack.) I have little faith that signatures will remain viable cross-platform without at least minimal canonicalization.  </s>
<s> Note also that it doesn't make sense to me to tell attorneys they must set a particular "canonicalization mode" in their word processors, if there ever is such a beast.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Rich  </s>
