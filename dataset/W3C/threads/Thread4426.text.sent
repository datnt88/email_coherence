In 3.4 it is stated that dm:type, in the absence of type information, returns xs:anyType or xs:anySimpleType. 
However in 4.1.7 it states that the type returned in such a circumstance will be unique and implementation-defined. 
On the face of it the statements are inconsistent. 
Andrew Watt -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 / Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say: The distinction is between items that do not have a type (they were skip validated or come from a well formed, non-validated document, for example) and those that have a type that is declared locally in the schema. 
The former return anyType/anySimpleType. 
The latter return an anonymous type name. 
Does that distinction help?
