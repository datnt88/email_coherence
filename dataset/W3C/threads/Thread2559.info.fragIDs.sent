<s> I recently asked about how you could use cookies to make some lightweight security, and got the answer that cookies are easy to spoof and thus very insecure.  </s>
<s> You can just as a server ask for another servers cookie, and then you can spoof the original server.  </s>
<s> My idea was that this kind of spoofing could be prevented, if the client stored the cookie with an identification of the server.  </s>
<s> Then to spoof you need to do IP spoofing, which can be done, but which is close to being criminal.  </s>
<s> Is that something to list in a "best practice" section somewhere?  </s>

<s> This concept works well with static IP addresses, but totally breaks when you get a different dynamically allocated IP address the next time you dial into your ISP.  </s>
<s> The IP is different, but no spoofing has occured, and the cookie is valid.  </s>

<s> You mean the client IP address?  </s>
<s> I was only thinking on having the server IP name recorded together with the cookie, and then the client could make a reverse DNS lookup to locate the cookie.  </s>
<s> Hmm, maybe it does not work for proxies... Then you could do something relevant to the DNS part of the url that has been issued... Keld  </s>
