<s> Of course I am sure someone on the list will recommend the best way to do it...but I figured I would take a guess.  </s>
<s> what about if the link had the appearance of no text such as an underscore [ _ ] nzhistory / governor / other / maybe just to save space you could use an underscore and in the href itself use the title attribute [ a href="#bypass_navigation" title="Use this link to bypass the navigation" _ /a ] could also place in a map and include the name attribute too... Let me know what you come up with because it is obvious that I need that same question answered.  </s>

<s> Jamie, The skip navigation you have provided is great, the same technique as www.acb.org, the first site I know of with a skip navigation link.  </s>

<s> Will they ignore you because you have white on white (ala www.firstgov.gov)  </s>
<s> or black on black ala www.assistivetech.net?  </s>
<s> Another easy option is pick a small invisible gif in an Anchor tag in front of NZHistory with alt text "skip navigation," and the obvious target.  </s>
<s> Lots of examples of this like www.ibm.com and www.cnn.com.  </s>

<s> If this is a typical table layout, are you aware of the this tactic: tr td ...logo.... td rowspan=2 ..... real contents ...... tr td ....Left hand navigation .....  </s>
<s> This meets linearised reading order guidelines, whereas skip links don't.  </s>

<s> CMN THis works for me, since I use a browser that lets me know what the alt is (actually I normally use a visual browser, but with keyboard control).  </s>
<s> I am not sure if it is still a problem for people - it is mostly orientation (knowing that you hit a link that you didn't see anywhere).  </s>

<s> CMN Not sure.  </s>
<s> Using this visually I would get confused - I expect something that looks the same to do the same thing (which it does) but I also expect the logo to be the link to the company, i.e. the front page.  </s>
<s> This is by convention, but it is one of the conventions I rely on more than any other on the web - even more than standard link presentation.  </s>
