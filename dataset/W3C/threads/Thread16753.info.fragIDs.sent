I would like to provide a 'skip navigation' link at the top of a page, yet want it to be as unobtrusive as possible. 
I know that making the font color 
the same as the background color is a no-no due to the the current crop of paranoid search engines thinking we are trying to fool them. 
Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title saying 'jump to main text' or some such? 
Here is an example of what I mean (work in progess): If not, can anyone suggest a better solution? 
Thanks Jamie Mackay 
Of course I am sure someone on the list will recommend the best way to do it...but I figured I would take a guess. 
what about if the link had the appearance of no text such as an underscore [ _ ] nzhistory / governor / other / maybe just to save space you could use an underscore and in the href itself use the title attribute [ a href="#bypass_navigation" title="Use this link to bypass the navigation" _ /a ] could also place in a map and include the name attribute too... Let me know what you come up with because it is obvious that I need that same question answered.

Jamie, The skip navigation you have provided is great, the same technique as www.acb.org, the first site I know of with a skip navigation link. 
I don't understand your worry about search engines. 
Will they ignore you because you have white on white (ala www.firstgov.gov) 
or black on black ala www.assistivetech.net? 
Another easy option is pick a small invisible gif in an Anchor tag in front of NZHistory with alt text "skip navigation," and the obvious target. 
Lots of examples of this like www.ibm.com and www.cnn.com. 
Good work.

Two techniques I found most effective and with little visual impact. 
First the single pixel gif with the appropriate alt attribute: img src="nada.gif" 
height="1" width="1" alt="Jump past all these repetitive links" This is easy to implement, has little impact on the page, and has been around since the dawn of HTML. 
Another easy solution is to take the first image on the page, normally an icon in the upper-left hand corner, and have it link to the content. 
I think this makes a good use of the logo (e.g. www.ssbtechnologies.com) and relieves the user from having to hear "Company Name" on every single page. 
The one exception to this might be the home page, where you let alt="Welcome to company name. 
In the future follow this link to jump directly to the content of a page bypassing the navbar." 
Hope that helps- TimS Behalf Of Jamie Mackay

If this is a typical table layout, are you aware of the this tactic: tr td ...logo.... td rowspan=2 ..... real contents ...... tr td ....Left hand navigation ..... 
This meets linearised reading order guidelines, whereas skip links don't. 
If it weren't for NS4, positioned divisions would be better. 
This is quite related to some work underway at: The Acrobat file at the bottom of the list (in draft) talks about this on page 6 Cheers Si.

CMN THis works for me, since I use a browser that lets me know what the alt is (actually I normally use a visual browser, but with keyboard control). 
I am not sure if it is still a problem for people - it is mostly orientation (knowing that you hit a link that you didn't see anywhere).

CMN Not sure. 
Using this visually I would get confused - I expect something that looks the same to do the same thing (which it does) but I also expect the logo to be the link to the company, i.e. the front page. 
This is by convention, but it is one of the conventions I rely on more than any other on the web - even more than standard link presentation.

CMN This is kind of like the image solution proposed by Tim above, except easier to have it not apply. 
(Another reason why constraint-based CSS was a cool idea.) cheers Chaals 
I would find the second method quite disorienting unless the words were correct in the alt tag which looses the intent of that image.

Personally I'm more in favor of the first of these two options. 
It associates specific information with the action that will be taken. 
The second option requires that the user remember that on a site that's what the company name link will do. 
This is far less obvious, especially if a user doesn't enter from the front page where this action might be the only place it is spelled out.

I wonder if hiding the "skip links" from graphic browsers--which I've done on a couple of sites with the invisible gif trick--is really a good idea. 
I'm starting to have second and third thoughts about it. 
What about folks who can't use a mouse? 
Isn't the "skip links" useful for them? 
Just wondering... Davey Leslie
