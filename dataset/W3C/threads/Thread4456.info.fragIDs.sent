Michael: Thank you for your comment. 
The WGs discussed this on 9/16/2003 and decided to remove the zero and one argument version of fn:concat(). 
All the best, Ashok

Concat() without arguments is of very limited use and should be disallowed (automatically generating code can easily recognize this case). 
Concat with one argument can be useful if the argument is extended to allow sequences and should be kept in that case. 
Otherwise it could still be cut. 
Concat with one argument can be useful if the argument is extended to allow sequences 
This can also be achieved with string-join with an empty separator. 
However, for the sake of regularity and convenience I feel that concat could also accept a string sequence in each argument (i.e. replace string? 
by string* in the prototype). 
Since concat is a special function (with unlimited # of arguments) 
we just have to rewrite: concat(s1, s2 ...sN) as concat( (s1, s2 ...sN) ) and then we can treat concat and string-join similarly, without additional complexity.

This has been considered, and ruled out on the basis of backwards compatibility with XPath 1.0. 
The string-join function meets this need. 
Remember that you can write things like: string-join(("There are", count($seq), "items in this sequence:", $seq), " Michael Kay
