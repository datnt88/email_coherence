<s> Concat() without arguments is of very limited use and should be disallowed (automatically generating code can easily recognize this case).  </s>
<s> Concat with one argument can be useful if the argument is extended to allow sequences and should be kept in that case.  </s>

<s> This can also be achieved with string-join with an empty separator.  </s>
<s> However, for the sake of regularity and convenience I feel that concat could also accept a string sequence in each argument (i.e. replace string?  </s>

<s> Since concat is a special function (with unlimited # of arguments)  </s>
<s> we just have to rewrite: concat(s1, s2 ...sN) as concat( (s1, s2 ...sN) ) and then we can treat concat and string-join similarly, without additional complexity.  </s>
