<s> Hi, I have a small question which I could not find in your archives.  </s>
<s> It is as follows: Can I insert HTML or text at a particular location in the text enclosed betwen tags.  </s>
<s> I mean suppose if I have a paragraph tag like this enclosing 7 lines betwwen the tags.  </s>
<s> Can I insert some HTML programmatically after line 3, for eg..? If yes how do I do it?  </s>
<s> line 1:Kolkata, June 20: The Justice Manoj Mukherjee Commission probing the mysterious line 2:disappearance of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has recorded an affidavit by a freedom line 3:fighter who claimed to have met Netaji in Myanmar in 1954, years after Bose reportedly line 4:died in the Taihoku air crash.  </s>
<s> Mubarak Mazdoor, who described himself as a freedom line 5:fighter and close associate of Jawaharlal Nehru and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, said in the line 6:affidavit that Netaji had been living in the guise of a Buddhist monk named 'Mong' in the line 7: Golden Pagoda in Myanmar when he had met him.  </s>
<s> Anticipating a positive response.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate it.  </s>
<s> Thanks Deepika.  </s>
<s> Try doing a TABLE with each of your lines in a TR  </s>
<s> The only way to do this is to use string manipulation, and split the text node yourself.  </s>
<s> You should delete the original node, and create two text nodes in it's place, with the values of the text before and after line 3. Then you can insert nodes between these two new text nodes.  </s>
