<s> This something abstract, not concrete.  </s>
<s> The word "documents" has been used on this thread because it is shorter.  </s>
<s> Tim BL  </s>
<s> You're probably right, but is it also the case that all corporeal things are generally recognized as disjoint from "documents"?  </s>
<s> Books, for example?  </s>

<s> From previous discussion, am I right in saying you'd count  </s>
<s> "The Bible", "Hamlet" etc as conceptual works; but foaf:Document (the RDF class) or cyc:ConceptualWork (another RDF class) as not being conceptual works.  </s>
<s> If so, what is it about the former that makes them more 'conceptual'?  </s>
<s> Are you claiming that RDF classes are purely mathematic constructs, discovered rather than created?  </s>
<s> I ask because I have several RDF implementations which depend on classes being allowed in httpRange...  </s>

<s> 1. I point you to a whole ontology - check the cyc classifications.  </s>
<s> 2. Nothing.  </s>
<s> They are all conceptual.  </s>
<s> Only things which convey information are works, in the sense of opus, oeuvre, something which decreases entropy  </s>
<s> and hence takes energy to create.  </s>
<s> I make no untestable statements about whether they are discovered or created.  </s>
<s> But I do distinguish them from for example an RDF schema, which has content and can be represented in RDF/XML or N3, can be copyright, etc etc.  </s>

<s> There's the basis of a distinction there, although the connection with the HTTP URI scheme naming policies is pretty weak.  </s>
<s> For FOAF, we could probably pull the switcheroo now with a fair amount of annoyance for implementors.  </s>
<s> But FOAF files also use Dublin Core, RSS1, MusicBrainz, XMP etc namespaces, all of which are named with a '/'.  </s>
<s> Also they use my wordnet namespace...  </s>
<s> The wordnet case is trickier.  </s>
<s> We have a namespace with 50,000 terms (classes) in it, named like http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Tree  </s>
<s> and dereference-able.  </s>
<s> There is no obvious parallel design with a # that allows both (a) reasonably intuitive end-user markup in the instance data and (b) terms to be individually derferenceable to something useful and smaller than the entire multi-megabyte dictionary.  </s>

<s> So if I can try to summarize the positions...  </s>
<s> Both sides agree that using URIs to identify different things should be avoided.  </s>
<s> The pro-hash side suggests that this ambiguity is best addressed by constraining URIs to identifying cyc:ConceptualWorks.  </s>
<s> This has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage that the fragment part of a URI is only seen by the client, not by HTTP intermediaries and servers.  </s>
<s> The pro-slash side suggests that it is best addressed by using a different URI to identify different things, or by being able to make assertions about the results of a GET.  </s>
<s> Intermediaries and servers can see the whole URI.  </s>
<s> From a "Do no harm" POV, the former appears more damaging in that many resources on the Web today aren't cyc:ConceptualWorks.  </s>
<s> Plus it reduces visibility such that intermediaries aren't nearly as useful (they can't tell which resource is being referenced, only which ConceptualWork). Mark.  </s>
