<s> I think there should be some slight rewording: 8.5 allow the user to search for renderable content  </s>
<s> and I am not sure if it is a P1 or not so lone as the ability to find it manually by reading the document is already provided elsewhere.  </s>
<s> 8.4 Allow the user to navigate among only the active elements in the document  </s>
<s> If it is already possible to navigate each element individually, and know what type of element it is (or at least whether it is an active type of element) then I think this is a P2 requirement.  </s>
<s> It seems to be well established that it is a P2 requirement for blind users and for people with limited mobility (which could go into a user impact matrix) Charles McCN  </s>

<s> Renderable content is content which is intended to be read by people, whether or not that content will be rendered in a default presentation.  </s>
<s> For example, in a cascade of object elements in html each of the objects referred to may be renderable (subject to the limitations of the user agent and any dependent technology) as well as the content of the innermost object.  </s>
<s> however the width and height of objects is not renderable content, but machine-specific presentation hints.  </s>
