<s> Having recently joined this list, certainly to sing the praises of Amaya 4.0, I looked in the archives for object support.  </s>
<s> I found eg the following from March 1999 "Date: Mon, 3 May 1999 18:44:16 -0400 (EDT) From: Charles McCathieNevile charles@w3.org  </s>
<s> Message-ID: Pine.LNX.4.10.9905031837200.22923-100000@tux.w3.org Subject: OBJECT  </s>
<s> Supporting OBJECT would be very cool.  </s>
<s> At the moment there is no obvious way to make a cascade of objects except by going to the structure view."  </s>
<s> Since Amaya, not being a "browser" does not support either  </s>
<s> Java or plugins, but with it supporting JPG images, I wondered how it might handle the following cascade of Objects.  </s>
<s> It should presumably display vib.jpg.  </s>
<s> In fact, although it clearly attempts to display this image, the image area is blank (at least when we try on Windows 2000) Can anyone comment on whether my expectations are correct, and whether this might be a bug or a feature?  </s>
<s> height="240" codetype="application/java" codebase="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/tests/object/browsers/" archive="chemsymphony.lite.zip"  </s>
<s> standby="Loading Java" title="Object displayed using Java" object data="models/codein.mol" type="chemical/x-mdl-molfile" width="320" height="240" title="object displayed using browser plugin" height="325" title="Display using image only" Text displayed if neither object nor image can be displayed This code is at Dept.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] It's in "good" company!  </s>
<s> IE 5.01 makes a total mess of this, at least if you reject ActiveX (for some reason, images as objects are considered ActiveX by the security profile).  </s>
<s> You get two broken image boxes of the appropriate size in each column (not for the JPEG though), plus the fallback text.  </s>
<s> (IE also runs object wave files in an external media player.) Mozilla M17 seems OK.  </s>
<s> I believe W3C were trying to get rid of object because of its complexity and inconsistent implementation, but I have a feeling  </s>
<s> it got a reprieve as there was nothing better.  </s>

<s> Well, if you are interested in the status of current implementations, I did a simple test a while ago.  </s>

<s> A browser missing from the above list, and which appears to implement object entirely consistently, and as intended by the specification is icab (www.icab.de).  </s>
<s> I have always been very impressed by this browser, and regard it, along with Amaya, as the "carrier" of the specifications.  </s>
<s> iCab has the advantage that it implements Java and the Netscape plugin API, and so can be tested with "chemical" objects.  </s>
<s> I might also add that the MacOS platform is missing from comment above (iCab is MacOS only!).  </s>
<s> By the way, and apologies for veering somewhat off subject, I find few search engines currently do anything like a sensible job with object .  </s>
<s> We have engineered htdig to do this.  </s>
<s> I agree however that the implementation of object is logically difficult.  </s>
<s> object can be nested.  </s>
<s> How does one ensure that the contents of each object layer are semantically the SAME?  </s>
<s> One cannot in general of course, and I suppose that is one reason that XML is really viewed as replacing this aspect of HTML.  </s>

<s> [ well, not quite related to Amaya, but keep the original list for now ... ]  </s>
<s> I know ... the reason was, at the time of testing, unfortunately a Mac in my office had burned out and I couldn't test Mac browsers, sorry.  </s>
<s> And also, current design of `object' is difficult to control by style sheets.  </s>
<s> Improvement/replacement of `object' is among requirements for XHTML 2.0.  </s>
