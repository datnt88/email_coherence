As mentioned in this last meeting, I've been playing with an issue tracking 
tool. 
During the meeting I added a few issues to the database to test the process. 
I am interested to hear if you find this tool useful and accessible.

this is a second request for info on who is creating graphics for wai, 
links and events are both transparent. 
observers would seem to be translated as contacts which is confusing. 
where is the collection archived? 
thanks jonathan These graphics 
tracking 
These graphics were not created by anyone specific to WAI. 
This is a W3C-wide tool. 
If you have recommendations for graphics, let me know and I can try to incorporate them into the interface. 
transparent? 
observers are people who are interested in tracking the issue but not necessarily working on it as well as people who are serving as contacts. 
yes, could be confusing. 
collection of what, the graphics?
