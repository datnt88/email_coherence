<s> Went live with the 50 State Quarters Interactive Map.  </s>
<s> This uses macromedia flash and provides alternative ways to view the information in text tables.  </s>
<s> So you can have graphics off.  </s>
<s> Overall the interactive map is close to "AA" conformance, but that darn rapid application development cycle nipped our heels and had us in a death grip!  </s>
<s> Last minute structural changes blew away object alt tags and javascript compliance.  </s>
<s> We need to do a top down review of all pages again and pick up those missing things.  </s>
<s> This will take some time, but will get it done.  </s>
<s> A learning experience in building large scale web application for the web.  </s>
<s> Please enter through the main US Mint web page, http://www.usmint.gov  </s>
<s> via the client side image map link for 50 States.  </s>
<s> Then go to another image map and select 50 States Interactive Map First time user.  </s>
<s> These image map will change soon.  </s>
<s> Now you are in!!! or go directly to it via One note the main page uses forms and input type=image.  </s>
<s> Beleive it or not this passes Bobby and WCAG.  </s>
<s> go figure.  </s>
<s> let me know what you think.  </s>
<s> we have some work to polish this some.  </s>

<s> Rob, I went in with Netscape 4.0 on Solaris; the URL isn't quite right (should be URL:http://www1.usmint.gov/50States/fsq/main.cfm .  </s>
<s> In Netscape, if you don't have Shockwave, you don't see much at all.  </s>
<s> I went to the main Mint site with Lynx, and saw only this: The United States Mint  </s>

<s> Turns out the NJ State Quarter link is the right one, but comparing the content in Netscape and Lynx, there's a lot missing.  </s>
<s> It seems that broken comment syntax is hiding most of the page; that's probably why Bobby passed it (it didn't see most of it).  </s>

<s> the main web site needs much work.  </s>
<s> there is going to be a redesign and make WCAG a requirement.  </s>
<s> Trouble is, I am the only person with experience and am trying to train everyone using baby steps admist the enormous workload.  </s>
<s> E-commerce has taken off and we are trying to ramp up to support this.  </s>
<s> i am implementing quality assurance in small doses because we have a product to get out.  </s>
<s> until we get everyone trained we will continue to pick up Universal accessibility after the fact.  </s>
<s> People are starting to "get" Universal accessibility, but it is going to take a while.  </s>
<s> BE very glad when the Federal Law is enacted.  </s>
<s> Objective is be Conformance Level Double A by the end of the year.  </s>
<s> This 50 State Quarters project was the first were we tried... what worries me is people do not understand how difficult this is to implement both before and after the fact with no training and experience - in dynamic environments with no people!  </s>
<s> To use the flash you will need to download it if you are not prompted.  </s>
<s> However, you can use the site without the graphics by using the text links.  </s>
<s> Even on the U.S. and State map you can only see where the quarters were reported - they are color coded.  </s>
<s> Even you want to see the details you can select the text link on top.  </s>
<s> Tried to make this navigable for everyone.  </s>
<s> But you never know unless you have time for usability testing!  </s>
<s> That is why the Interest Group is so valuable.  </s>
<s> We use so many diverse tools, that we are our own test environment!  </s>
<s> Also, your notes will be passed along to our developers.  </s>
<s> thanks...rob  </s>
