Cookies can contain a maximum of 4kb of data which must be transmitted across the network twice before it can be used. 
For this reason, cookies tend to store only a number (or unique key) which links to a value in a database. 
Data about a user is stored in a database and that record is given a number (a unique key). 
Only this number is stored in the cookie on the user's computer. 
When the user revisits the site which set the cookie, that site can immediately have access to a potentially unlimited amount of information about the user simply by looking up the number in the database in which the number is a key. 
Linkability may be direct or indirect. 
For example a key stored in one cookie may not link directly to a user's name but instead the user's name may be deduced by examining two cookies replayed by separate domains but linked by a unique referrer. 
Example 1. Image A on Domain A replays a cookie linking to a record of the user's street name and number. 
Image B on Domain B replays a cookie which links to a record of the user's home town. 
Images A and B are displayed on pages with session ID's within Domain C. By using the referrer URI (which contains a unique session key), these two cookies be linked together to give a unique address and through another database, the user's name. 
With enough effort, similar but more sophisticated data mining techniques may be applied to link even seemingly highly anonymised data with cookie values. 
P3P applies the principle of proportionality to such linkability. 
The specification of the data and purposes covered by cookie should be thought of in terms of the analysis which might reasonably be carried out on such a cookie to achieve the stated purpose. 
For example if a cookie is set to track criminals' personal data then it is reasonable that a considerable effort might be put into database analysis. 
The cookie should therefore be said applying to personally identifiable data even if the data is actually hashed in the database. 
If on the other hand, the cookie is set in order to track a session and data is stored in the database but anonymised by hashing, then there is no need to state that the data is identifiable. 
This type of anonymization is in theory not secure because hashes have a 1-1 correspondence with ip addresses for example so by hashing all possible ip addresses, you can trace the original ip address. 
However extending the definition of linkability to this extent is neither practical nor reasonable. 
Third party cookies are cookies which are set by a domain other than the page being viewed. 
This is done through embedded images as in Example 1 and can even occur in emails and applications which use web services, such as music players. 
While normally the information stored in one domain's cookie cannot be accessed by another domain, third party cookies bypass this mechanism by placing the same third party image in different domain's pages. 
This allows tracking of users across different domains. 
The intention to carry out such tracking activities through linking cookie keys across different domains should also be declared. 
A connected problem is that a site SETTING a cookie may not be in control of all the purposes to which a cookie is put ON REPLAY. 
For example some domains set a domain level cookie (at the level *.xyz.com) which is replayed to thousands of subhosts (a.xyz.com,b.xyz.com ...), whose data collection practices are not under their control. 
Currently the solution of evaluating cookies on replay has been discounted because of performance issues and data protection issues linked to the act of storage of data on the user's machine. 
Therefore P3P requires that entities publishing policies in accordance with correct practice declare any potential purposes to which a cookie might be put. 
It follows therefore that if a cookie is used for a new and unforseen purpose, it SHOULD be reset along with a fresh P3P policy.

I don't think that this type of triangulation is really all that likely a scenario, remembering that Domains A and B are likely separate entities with separate web servers with no practical means of linking that cookie they each receive come from the same user (unless they have somehow coordinated to set the same unique_id). 
I see where you are going with referrer and while that may give you a guess it would be a far fetched one. 
I also agree with your analysis of domain level cookies. 
I think this has always been a real thorn in the side of P3P. 
I will make a broad generalization here, and feel free to shoot it down, - most large domains and nearly all corporate domains outsource at least one or two hosts on their domain and additionally maintain exceptionally little control of their internal hosts (bobjones.company.com). 
Here is another broad generalization - many, many corporate domains set a domain level unique id cookie which they claim to be pseudonymous. 
I would venture a guess that that the majority of these folks also have a corporate intranet on the same domain that requires authentication usually via REMOTE_USER. 
So now what is being logged on the intranet: REMOTE_USER and DOMAIN COOKIE!!! Opps looks like Domain cookie is no longer anonymous. 
I think that what all this points to is, sadly, true accuracy and compliancy are beyond the efforts that most implementers are taking at this time.

Giles Hogben European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen Cybersecurity New technologies for Combatting Fraud Unit TP 267 Via Enrico Fermi The 2 cookie webservers don't need to co-ordinate a unique ID. 
The referrer session key tells them that the 2 cookies refer to the same individual and so if they put their data together the full identity pops out after the event, without any prior agreement. 
Image A sends cookie A and referrer session id Image B sends cookie B and the same referrer session id So the cookie data is linked by the referrer session id Do you think this is unlikely? 
I'm not sure. 
I could try to make the example clearer or I could try to simplify it. 
One could have all three on the same domain for example. 
The point was to illustrate how linking can be indirect.
