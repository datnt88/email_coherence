<s> Jon, No these are not out of scope.  </s>
<s> The following requirement does not mention scripting specifically, but I believe it covers it, "eneralized across technologies: WCAG 1.0 primarily addresses the needs of an accessible HTML page.  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 needs to encompass emerging technologies such as XML-based languages (e.g., SVG, SMIL, MathML, etc.)." we are dealing with improved navigation markup now.  </s>
<s> I sent a proposal to the UA and WCAG mailing lists on Tuesday.  </s>
<s> Also, I believe those issues are covered by the following open issues cited in the requirements draft document: "-Accurately identify what works, what may not, and why - test techniques, give results.  </s>
<s> ideas should be verified in some way.  </s>
<s> usability testing as we draft.  </s>
<s> how collect data?  </s>
<s> Deal with the "until user agents" clause which causes confusion.  </s>
<s> -specify user needs.  </s>
<s> even if we don't have an answer, we still need to describe the problem and whether the need is being met.? -Guidance to create pages for people with cognivite and learning disabilities, primarily navigation issues."  </s>
