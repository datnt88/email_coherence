A press release from Al Gore at the accessibility of his web site with Bush's. 
It references a 7/17/2000 story in the Washington Post of the articles that quotes Judy BTW). 
The article notes problems in the Bush site found with Bobby, and WAVE, but no problems in the Gore Site. 
The article also references the W3C tools list.

Bobby and Wave may not detect this problem, but it is usually very disorienting to visually impaired users. 
This violates checkpoint 10.1 in WCAG, notably a priority 2 checkpoint.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Joh, right, it has a popup that violates 10.1. 
Neither Bobby nor the WAVE caught it (technique 10.1.2 in AERT [1] would have caught it... but neither Bobby nor WAVE implement that yet). 
This wouldn't keep them from advertising Bobby Approval anyway, since Bobby approval corresponds to Priority 1, and as you point out popups are priority 2. (BTW, there's no such thing as "WAVE approved"... it simply refers people to WCAG.) I'll email the Gore site webmaster... about that popup and becoming double A in general. 
(If someone else has already done so please tell me). 
It's great for people to be boasting of accessibility as a competitive edge!
