<s> New content is also cached locally.  </s>
<s> Other than faster loading times, the process is generally transparent to the user, except that the URL served may be different than the one requested.  </s>
<s> Content delivery can also be used for specific high-traffic events such as live Web broadcasts by continually dispersing content from the originating server to other servers via satellite links.  </s>

<s> Good topic...  </s>
<s> There are several uses of content in play.  </s>
<s> One is "element content" in the strict XML sense - the stuff between an opening tag and its closing tag, which may include elements (e.g. for the content of an HTML head element it is required for validity to include a title element) Another is the information contained in an element, which will include attribute values.  </s>
<s> I suggest we use the longer form "information contained in an element" Then there is the content of a document.  </s>
<s> This includes information contained in elements, and may also include a more abstract notion of "the information a document is conveying".  </s>
<s> This is an important difference.  </s>
<s> It is not required at the moment that all the information contained in all the elements of a document be in an accessible form, although UAAG requires that a user can get any of the  </s>
<s> information contained in any element of the document (by some means).  </s>
<s> WCAG does require that "the information a document is conveying" is all available in an accessible form.  </s>
<s> For example, the following code fragment There is a very close correspondence between the average maximum daily temparature in Melbourne and how close the date is to mid-February.  </s>
<s> probably includes information in a purely graphical format, and information in a purely textual format.  </s>
<s> Neither of these pieces of information is by itself accessible, at least in terms of triple-A conformance to WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> However the information being conveyed, by being available in two forms, probably is.  </s>
<s> I suggest we use four different terms: "information provided by an element": The element content, and any additional information referred to by attributes of an element.  </s>
<s> In HTML, this includes such things as objects referred to by an object or img element, alternative text included in an alt attribute, the information provided by title attributes, and the text or information inside an element such as a p, a, or code element.  </s>
<s> "element content": The text or other elements contained between the opening tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language.  </s>

<s> my 2 bits.... Charles, It seems to me that some of the terms that you suggest are similar to those already defined in ATAG.  </s>
<s> For example, I think "information conveyed by a document" and "Information provided by an element" are trying to get at the intent and purpose of including those elements.  </s>
<s> The purpose is based on how the user perceives and/or uses the contents of the element or its attributes.  </s>
<s> Perhaps reusing "rendered content" is the most efficient approach (rather than selecting new phrases to use).  </s>
<s> I really like what is in ATAG and propose we inherit some of those definitions in WCAG, at least as a starting point to see how they fit.  </s>
<s> Some other thoughts: element content - The text or other elements contained between the opening tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language.  </s>
<s> (this is specific to one selected element) content - 1. a collection of element content, i.e. every node in the tree.  </s>
<s> 2. an individual node of the tree that has can been rendered in some medium.  </s>
<s> 3. content is information intended to be presented to the user or controls that the user will interact with.  </s>
<s> rendered content - content that has been rendered in some medium for the purposes of user interaction.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the distinction is that we have individual nodes and we have the collection of nodes.  </s>
<s> I see the individual nodes being called "element content" and the collection as "the content."  </s>
<s> I see this as being synch with the beginning of the ATAG definition where it states, "Content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts."  </s>
<s> "Document" only seems to apply if the collection of nodes makes a document; some of these collections will be applications rather than documents.  </s>
<s> I know it refers to the "document object" and therefore all of the nodes.  </s>
<s> It has confused readers in the past, leading them to believe we are only talking about documents and not including applications.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I hope we can be careful in the usage of the word "document" (i.e. be consistent with DOM definitions but also keep in mind the possible confusion it has for readers).  </s>
