Glossary: Aggregation (of online content) Online aggregation is the process of gathering and storing content from various sources, that it gets sorted and distributed according to rules, preferences or levels of service. 
Aggregation is based on a 'pull' dynamic, and it is generally the first process of a syndication routine, which is a 'push' dynamic. 
Content Raw information becomes content when it is given a useable form intended for one or more purposes. 
Increasingly, the value of content is based upon the combination of its primary useable form, along with its application, accessibility, usage, usefulness, brand recognition, and uniqueness. 
Information passed casually around in the world is not content. 
It becomes content when we grab it and try to make some use of it.

(Content-wire) Content Delivery On the Internet, content delivery (aka content distribution or caching) is the process of copying the pages of a Web site to geographically dispersed servers and, when a page is requested, dynamically identifying and serving the page from the closest server to the user, enabling faster delivery. 
High-traffic Web site owners and Internet service providers (ISPs) hire the services of the company that provides content delivery. 
A common content delivery approach involves the placement of cache servers at major Internet access points around the world and the use of a special routing code that redirects a Web page request (technically, a Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP - request) to the closest server. 
When the Web user clicks on a URL that is content-delivery enabled, the content delivery network re-routes that user's request away from the site's originating server to a cache server closer to the user. 
The cache server determines what content in the request exists in the cache, serves that content, and retrieves any non-cached content from the originating server. 
New content is also cached locally. 
Other than faster loading times, the process is generally transparent to the user, except that the URL served may be different than the one requested. 
Content delivery can also be used for specific high-traffic events such as live Web broadcasts by continually dispersing content from the originating server to other servers via satellite links. 
Content delivery is similar to but more selective and dynamic than the simple copying or mirroring of a Web site to one or several geographically dispersed servers. 
(Definition by Cdd/101, masters of content delivery knowledge) Content Management The concept of Content Management has evolved very rapidly towards the 
end of the last millennium. 
The very first definitions were not making a clear distinction between Document, Knowledge and Content Management, while evolutionary thinking establishes that the three disciplines above are connected but distinct. 
Content-wire glossary is temporarily adopting the definition proposed by Content-Bridge Alliance, until further elaboration is available: In its purest form, Content Management is simply a set of rules and processes for contributing, collaborating on and controlling content. 
It may include document management through common workflows, media management based on a centralized contentbase and common tools for content creation and publishing. 
In its broadest sense, Content Management is a combination of software tools and business processes that allow corporations to effectively manage and deliver large amounts of diverse information to different media in the 
most effective means. 
Original Content Unique work of the Mind. 
It is manifest in works of art, and in most expressions of the intellectual and creative human activities (when functioning properly). 
The manipulation and contextualization of known news and facts, once expressed in a unique form or manner, are also original content. 
Years of controversy surround the definition or 'unique' and 'original', and require highly specialized legal technical skills to assess merit in matters of copyright and intellectual property law. 
Original Content is key to new economy business models.

[Bahorsky] SIRSI Content ? 
Common term for information or knowledge managed and shared over the Internet Mail References for "content": From: Sean P. "Really, "Web Content" should be used to indicate any network retrievable "Web Resource" [2], but I think that WCAG uses it in the sense of "content suitable for use in a hypermedia environment", i.e. anything that can be handled by HTTP." From: Ian Jacobs UAAG 1.0 uses "content = document object". 
"it would seem that content is what you get back as the manifestation of a resource" Katie Haritos-Shea Internet/Software/Device Accessibility and Standards Strategist/Developer/Evangelist #571-220-7777 
Good topic... 
There are several uses of content in play. 
One is "element content" in the strict XML sense - the stuff between an opening tag and its closing tag, which may include elements (e.g. for the content of an HTML head element it is required for validity to include a title element) Another is the information contained in an element, which will include attribute values. 
I suggest we use the longer form "information contained in an element" Then there is the content of a document. 
This includes information contained in elements, and may also include a more abstract notion of "the information a document is conveying". 
This is an important difference. 
It is not required at the moment that all the information contained in all the elements of a document be in an accessible form, although UAAG requires that a user can get any of the 
information contained in any element of the document (by some means). 
WCAG does require that "the information a document is conveying" is all available in an accessible form. 
For example, the following code fragment There is a very close correspondence between the average maximum daily temparature in Melbourne and how close the date is to mid-February. 
probably includes information in a purely graphical format, and information in a purely textual format. 
Neither of these pieces of information is by itself accessible, at least in terms of triple-A conformance to WCAG 1.0. 
However the information being conveyed, by being available in two forms, probably is. 
I suggest we use four different terms: "information provided by an element": The element content, and any additional information referred to by attributes of an element. 
In HTML, this includes such things as objects referred to by an object or img element, alternative text included in an alt attribute, the information provided by title attributes, and the text or information inside an element such as a p, a, or code element. 
"element content": The text or other elements contained between the opening tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language. 
"document content": All the text, elements and data contained in a document, or referred to by elements contained in a document. 
"information conveyed by a document": The essential content which the author considers the document is conveying. 
This may duplicated in a document, for example by having textual versions and references to graphic representations in teh same document content.

Right. 
If we have 4 clear definitions, including one term that exactly matches the needs of UAAG which will not be confused with what WCAG means, then I think we will be doing better than if we do have the same term used differently in different specs. 
This is particularly true for ATAG, which effectively requires its audience to read both WCAG and UAAG. 
There is a discussion on IG about background images and whether they are covered by WCAG checkpoint 1.1 because they are content - my hope is that this sort of discussion can be avoided in future by better defining the different meanings. 
In this case, the proposed term "document content" would be what UAAG means, whereas "information provided by the document" would be what WCAG most often means.

Here are the assumptions of UAAG 1.0: In UAAG 1.0, we do talk about content "whose recognized role is to create a purely stylistic effect." 
The expectation is that the user agent can recognize this role from the content. 
For example, from style sheets. 
Our assumption is that style sheets should only be used to create stylistic effects. 
So a background image set by style sheets would not require a text equivalent (no more than it would be necessary to have a text equivalent "red" for a red background color). 
Style is, of course, "important". 
But if the author has used style sheets to set a background image that conveys important "information", it would seem to be a misuse of style sheets. 
Setting a background image through a style attribute of HTML is the same thing. 
Authors may misuse markup. 
For UAAG 1.0, we must assume that they also use markup correctly in some cases.

my 2 bits.... Charles, It seems to me that some of the terms that you suggest are similar to those already defined in ATAG. 
For example, I think "information conveyed by a document" and "Information provided by an element" are trying to get at the intent and purpose of including those elements. 
The purpose is based on how the user perceives and/or uses the contents of the element or its attributes. 
Perhaps reusing "rendered content" is the most efficient approach (rather than selecting new phrases to use). 
I really like what is in ATAG and propose we inherit some of those definitions in WCAG, at least as a starting point to see how they fit. 
Some other thoughts: element content - The text or other elements contained between the opening tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language. 
(this is specific to one selected element) content - 1. a collection of element content, i.e. every node in the tree. 
2. an individual node of the tree that has can been rendered in some medium. 
3. content is information intended to be presented to the user or controls that the user will interact with. 
rendered content - content that has been rendered in some medium for the purposes of user interaction. 
Therefore, the distinction is that we have individual nodes and we have the collection of nodes. 
I see the individual nodes being called "element content" and the collection as "the content." 
I see this as being synch with the beginning of the ATAG definition where it states, "Content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts." 
"Document" only seems to apply if the collection of nodes makes a document; some of these collections will be applications rather than documents. 
I know it refers to the "document object" and therefore all of the nodes. 
It has confused readers in the past, leading them to believe we are only talking about documents and not including applications. 
Therefore, I hope we can be careful in the usage of the word "document" (i.e. be consistent with DOM definitions but also keep in mind the possible confusion it has for readers).
