Hello, Today W3C launched a new home page design that uses CSS to lay out three columns rather than an HTML table. 
It has been a longstanding goal of W3C that page designers should used style sheets, not HTML structure markup, to create layout and other stylistic effects. 
We are pleased that support for style sheets in browsers has reached a point where we are now confident in the portability of this approach. 
The new layout is achieved with CSS floats [1]. 
The W3C Communications Team has tested this solution (and other approaches) with a number of user agents in a number of desktop environments; see the list below. 
The Comm Team's experiments suggested that to achieve horizontal layout, there was better interoperability using floats than using absolute positioning. 
The Communications Team welcomes your feedback on the new design, and in particular whether the CSS layout works or doesn't work in your environment. 
What does "works" mean? 
After the introductory text, the page is divided into three columns of differing lengths. 
The page is designed to be readable even if a user agent doesn't support floats, though the content will take up more horizontal space. 
Thank you, Janet Daly Communications Team, W3C [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren#floats 
The following user agents render the W3C home page as intended, with only minor cosmetic differences among them: Windows 2000 IE 6.0 Mozilla 1.2b Opera 6.0.5 Opera 7.0b1v2 - text at bottom of page has wrong background color Mac OS 9 IE 5.0 IE 5.1.6 
Netscape 6.2.3 Netscape 7.0 Mozilla 1.2b MacLynx b1 Opera 5.0.485 
Mac OS X IE 5.2.2 Netscape 7.0 Mozilla 1.2b OmniWeb 4.1.1 - width problem in right column Opera 6.0b2 Linux Netscape 4.7 Opera 6.0 Mozilla 1.0 Mozilla 1.2-1 Konqueror 2.2.2 - there are some issues with the middle column flowing to the left margin. 
The following user agents do not handle floats: Windows 2000 Amaya 6.4 - looks like Netscape 4 Amaya 7.0 - looks like Netscape 4 Mac OS 9 IE 4.5 - looks like Netscape 4 Mac OS X iCab 2.8.2 Linux Amaya 5.3 Amaya 7.0 Lynx 2.8.4rel.1 - Since Lynx doesn't implement tables, this design works better with Lynx than the previous one. 
The design does not work on the following user agents: Mac OS 9 IE 3.01a and IE 4.01 Netscape 4.08 Netscape 4.8 iCab 2.82 - minor linespacing problem in news headings This is some feedback giving my experience with that three column layout. 
I have tried Netscape 7 and Mozilla 1.2.1, IE6, Opera 7 beta, all on Win XP. 
I usually have browser windows sized at an external width of 800 pixels but with Netscape 7 or Mozilla I make heavy use of the sidebar panel resulting in the content area having a width of about 620 pixels. 
This with both Netscape 7 and Mozilla 1.2.1 results in the link with text Internationalization being cut off, you can read Internationalizati. 
This caused me to try to check rendering when the content area is even smaller, and indeed when you resize the window to a smaller width Mozilla/NN7 keep the three column but content in the left column is cut off. 
When I check the same with IE6 it behaves much differently, it assures that the content in columns is visible but drops the three column layout, e.g. at a content are width of 566 it renders the left and middle column side by side but the right column is rendered below the other two. 
If you further reduce the width then IE moves the middle column below the left, keeping the left column content visible (e.g Internationalization is not cut off). 
Opera 7 beta exhibits the same behaviour as Mozilla, even with a very low width of the content area the three columns are rendered side by side but the content in the left column is cut off. 
Thus at least with Mozilla and Opera it seems that the choosen CSS column layout has its shortcomings as content is cut off in the left column if the content area width is low. 
I am also wondering which browser is doing the right thing here, Mozilla and Opera keeping the three columns side by side but cutting off content or IE6. Martin Martin Honnen Excellent!! :-) Why don't you go a step further and try to publish it in XHTML Basic? 
It wouldn't be difficult and you would improve accessibility even more. 
You should only have to do some minor changes (remove a map tag, a sup tag and adjust some few attributes), and it's done! 
Best regards.
