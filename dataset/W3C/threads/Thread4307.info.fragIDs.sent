<s> (Full disclosure: I have argued that the XML Schema WG adopt the xdt: types related to durations for reasons closely related to my positions in this message.)

<s> Of course, character strings are pretty well understood by most people (although Unicode has offered some challenges to some of those people), while durations are inherently more complex.  </s>
<s> MK So why don't we have special data types for lengths, weights, voltages, and temperatures?  </s>
<s> None of this reasoning convinces me that durations are any different from other units of measure, or that there is a good case for treating them differently.  </s>
<s> If we did really clever things with "complex" durations (those that mix months and seconds), then there might be some argument.  </s>
<s> But we've decided not to handle complex durations, and only handle those that map trivially to numbers: which means, as I see it, that our data types are not adding any value.  </s>
<s> JM Let's look at a detail or two.  </s>
<s> In [1], Mike uses this example: A dateTime with lexical representation 1999-05-31T13:20:00-05:00 has a value represented by the tuple (1999-05-31T18:20:00Z, -18000) JM I consider myself fairly adept at mental arithmetic, but I have to pause for awhile to figure out that "-18000" means "Eastern Standard Time" in the USA, Canada, and probably other locations --- in other words, that it means "-05:00", or "5 timezones to the west of UTC".  </s>
<s> In fairness, Mike has not proposed that the lexical representation of the time zone component of an xs:dateTime be changed.  </s>
<s> But he does propose that the *value space* representation be changed to a number of seconds, and it is the value space representation that application/query writers have to manipulate.  </s>
<s> MK Well, there is at least one country in the world that still uses non-metric units for lengths.  </s>
<s> If you're going to manipulate lengths in feet and inches, then you're going to have to get used to doing a lot of arithmetic to convert between different representations of a length.  </s>
<s> I ask the question again: why are durations different?  </s>
<s> And if you don't like using constants like -18000, it's easy to write them as variables ($TZ:EDT, for example) or as expressions (for example: tz(-5)).  </s>
<s> JM Mike also proposes that: The elapsed time between two dates, times, or dateTimes is generally handled as a number of seconds, expressed as an xs:double.  </s>
<s> Some functions are also provided that manipulate a duration as an integer number of months.  </s>
<s> All arithmetic, comparison, and sorting of durations is achieved by expressing the duration as an xs:integer number of months plus an xs:double number of seconds, and then manipulating these values using conventional numeric arithmetic.  </s>
<s> JM As I said above, this is a perfectly reasonable mechanism for implementations to use internally.  </s>
<s> But I believe that it is generally awkward and confusing to have humans manipulate this notation for a data type that inherently has structure to it.  </s>
<s> Quick now, what is the difference between 11:00 and 17:00?  </s>
<s> Six hours, right?  </s>
<s> Sure, that's the same as 21600 seconds, but why is that important in this particular calculation?  </s>
<s> MK Well, having calculated the difference, what are you going to do with it?  </s>
<s> If you want to display it as "six hours", then I would suggest that translating "PT6H" to "six hours" is likely to be just as difficult as translating "21600".  </s>
<s> If you want to do anything with the result other than display it (for example, to calculate the average speed over your journey, or to plot it on a graph in SVG), then the value 21600 is much more useful to you than the value PT6H.  </s>
<s> JM Worse, imagine having to write a query that asks "What is the sum of 3 hours 45 minutes and 4 hours 15 minutes?"  </s>
<s> Should a query writer have to first translate each of the values into a numeric value, then perform the addition, then transform the result back into a duration?  </s>
<s> Or would the query writer be better off with merely adding the two values together?  </s>
<s> Consider the following examples (which I have sincerely attempted to write fairly).  </s>
<s> Assume that an XQuery variable $dur1 contains the first value, 3 hours 45 minutes, and another variable $dur2 contains the second value, 4 hours 45 minutes.  </s>
<s> (In the existing F&amp;O specification, the types of $dur1 and $dur2 would be xdt:dayTimeDuration; under Mike's proposal, both would have the type xs:duration.) (1) fn:make-duration ( 0, ( fn:get-seconds-from-duration ( $dur1 ) + fn:get-seconds-from-duration ( $dur2 ) ) ) (2) $dur1 + $dur2 Given that choice, I think that most query authors would prefer the simplicity (and, probably less important, brevity) of example (2).  </s>
<s> MK Firstly, you are assuming that the data starts of as a duration.  </s>
<s> My expectation is that usually, it won't.  </s>
<s> For a start, I think that it's much more common in persistent data to hold absolute dates/times than to hold durations; and in many fields of application, where people do hold durations, I think they will already be held as numbers.  </s>
<s> XBRL, for example, always holds duration information as a start date and end date; while I have seen XML files that compare the performance of different software products under different operational conditions, and they invariably represent elapsed times as numbers.  </s>
<s> They typically start life as numbers, and I think most people would need a compelling reason to translate the number 132.0578 into the duration PT132.0578S; the fact that the duration data type exists isn't of itself a reason for using it.  </s>
<s> I agree that your example 2 is easier, and my advice would be that to achieve this simplicity, all you need to do is represent your durations as numbers, just as you would represent lengths or monetary amounts.  </s>
<s> JM Again, ask the question "What time will it be 4 hours 30 minutes after 8:00?".  </s>
<s> In this case, $time1 has type xs:time in both examples and contains the time 08:00.  </s>
<s> $dur1 has either type xs:duration or type xdt:dayTimeDuration, both representing 4 hours 30 minutes.  </s>
<s> (3) fn:add-seconds-to-time ( $time1, fn:get-seconds-from-duration ( $dur1 ) (4) $time1 + $dur1 Again, I feel that the second example would generally be preferred by most query authors.  </s>
<s> MK I agree that there is a need for special data types to represent dates and (probably) times, and that this creates a need for special functions to do arithmetic on dates.  </s>
<s> In this case I am not at all convinced that overloading the "+" operator is a good idea.  </s>
<s> There are two reasons why (4) looks more appealing than (3).  </s>
<s> One reason is that you have chosen to start with a duration represented as an xs:duration, whereas I think it will be equally common (whether the Software AG proposal is accepted or not) to start with a duration represented as a number.  </s>
<s> (I don't think I have every used an interval data type in SQL; I have always used numbers.)  </s>
<s> The second reason is that our operators are generally one character while our function names can be 28 characters or more.  </s>
<s> If we started with a numeric duration, and used shorter function names, then these two examples might read as: (3') later($time1, $dur1) (4') $time1 + seconds($dur1) where I think there is no practical difference in usability.  </s>
<s> JM Now, in [2], Jeni Tennison has correctly observed that F&amp;O fails to provide for the obvious operations of division of an xdt:yearMonthDuration by another xdt:yearMonthDuration and division of an xdt:dayTimeDuration by another xdt:dayTimeDuration, as well as subtraction of two dates from each other to get a xdt:yearMonthDuration (rather than a xdt:dayTimeDuration)?  </s>
<s> That omission is certainly something that could be corrected (even though I note in passing that the SQL standard does not provide for division of one duration/INTERVAL by another).  </s>
<s> MK In my view there's an infinite number of functions on durations that can only be achieved by converting them to numbers.  </s>
<s> Patching up the gaps is pointless, there will always be more.  </s>
<s> JM But I am not so comfortable with Mike's need to compute average speeds by dividing a number by a duration --- even though that is made easier by his proposal and the equivalent using existing F&amp;O capabilities is rather tedious.  </s>
<s> By the way, I think the two approaches to solving this problem would look something like this.  </s>
<s> In these examples, $dur1 is either an xdt:dayTimeDuration or an xs:duration, and $dist is an xs:double.  </s>
<s> (5) $dist div fn:get-seconds-from-duration ( $dur1 ) (6) $dist div ( ( ( fn:get-days-from-dayTimeDuration ( $dur1 ) * 24 + fn:get-hours-from-dayTimeDuration ( $dur1 ) ) * 60 + fn:get-minutes-from-dayTimeDuration ( $dur1 ) ) * 60 + fn:get-seconds-from-dayTimeDuration ( $dur1 ) ) * 60 It's very clear that Mike's alternative is much shorter and easier to understand.  </s>
<s> However, one must ask whether this is a typical question that will be asked using durations.  </s>
<s> In some business, it will be; in others, it will not be.  </s>
<s> I suggest that, in businesses where such a question is common, it is easy enough to write a user-defined function (my:convert-dayTimeDuration-to-seconds, for example) to be used by every query needing this sort of computation, which would reduce example (6) to: (7) $dist div my:convert-dayTimeDuration-to-seconds ( $dur1 ) And (7) is not significantly different from (5).  </s>
<s> MK I actually started with a real-life problem of comparing performance measurements on software products, and decided to translate it to something that looked less parochial.  </s>
<s> JM We come now to my final source of discomfort, and this is one that I do not believe can be papered over by workarounds.  </s>
<s> In Mike's proposal, he deletes the two newly-defined subtypes of xs:duration, xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration.  </s>
<s> A prime reason for the creation of those two subtypes is that each of them is "totally ordered", meaning that one can compare two values of one type and unambiguously determine whether the first is greater than the second, or less than it, or equal to it.  </s>
<s> By contrast, one cannot do that with values of the xs:duration type in the general case.  </s>
<s> I believe that the same deficiency would result from Mike's proposal, leaving the user to deal with the consequences.  </s>
<s> MK Yes.  </s>
<s> Our two data types do nothing to solve the problem of managing complex durations.  </s>
<s> They try to wish the problem away.  </s>
<s> One of the fundamental insights that came from my colleagues in Darmstadt was that the justification for duration data types is because durations are difficult, but we have restricted ourselves to handling only those durations that are easy, in which case the justification for having special data types disappears.  </s>
<s> JM Consider two values of type xs:duration under Mike's proposal.  </s>
<s> One of these, $dur1, is (effectively) constructed from fn:make-duration(2, 0) and the other, $dur2, from fn:make-duration(1, 30*24*60*60).  </s>
<s> What is the result of comparing $dur1 and $dur2?  </s>
<s> It is not possible to determine this unambiguously.  </s>
<s> The reason is simple: We do not know how many days there are in a month!  </s>
<s> Some months have 31 days, others have either 28 or 29 days (depending on the year involved).  </s>
<s> Therefore, the expression "30*24*60*60" may or may not equal 1 month.  </s>
<s> Consequently, the type xs:duration is *not* totally ordered.  </s>
<s> That means, of course, that some pairs of values, such as fn:make-duration(2, 0) and $dur2, from fn:make-duration(1, 1*24*60*60), can be compared without ambiguity (2 months is greater than 1 month and 1 day), while others cannot.  </s>
<s> The existing F&amp;O specification that introduces and uses the two xdt: types avoid the mixing of year-month durations and day-time durations specifically because of this problem.  </s>
<s> In Mike's proposal, he suggests (in changes to Annex C.5) that one could define comparison of two values of type xs:duration by comparing their months values and also comparing their seconds values and require that both must be equal in order for the result of the comparison to indicate equality.  </s>
<s> But he admits that greater than and less than comparisons are more problematic because of the partially-ordered nature of xs:duration.  </s>
<s> He suggests a pragmatic solution that uses 365.242199 as the average number of days in a year.  </s>
<s> That works well when the values involves are intended for statistical use (e.g., over thousands, probably even hundreds, of years), but they don't work nearly as well for computations involving one year or two years or 1 month!  </s>
<s> MK The key point of my proposal in this area is that mixed durations are indeed problematic, and that our two new data types do nothing to help the user in handling them, and because they don't help with the problem, they serve no useful purpose.  </s>
<s> By contrast, if complex durations are represented as a pair of numbers, there are various algorithms the user could employ to make them tractable, some of which might meet the needs of some applications.  </s>
<s> If you've got a pair of numbers, the problem is probably easier to deal with than if you've got a (xdt:yearMonthDuration, xdt:dayMonthDuration) pair.  </s>
<s> JM In short (in case I have not been clear), I cannot support, and will oppose, acceptance of this proposal on the grounds that it quite often makes the application/query authors' lives more difficult, raises the probability of errors that will result in support costs borne by vendors, and loses the safety provided by the xdt: types, all in the goal of simplifying the lives of the authors of the XQuery/XPath suite of documents.  </s>
<s> MK I emphatically do NOT try to justify the proposal on the basis that it makes the lives of implementors and specifiers easier.  </s>
<s> The key point about the proposal is that it makes the language significantly smaller without removing any useful functionality, and that this actually makes the users' lives easier.  </s>
<s> Thanks for giving the proposal such careful attention!  </s>
<s> Michael Kay  </s>
<s> So why don't we have special data types for lengths, weights, voltages, and temperatures?  </s>
<s> None of this reasoning convinces me that durations are any different from other units of measure, or that there is a good case for treating them differently.  </s>
<s> Mike, Here's one reason: XML Schema provides built-in types for dates, times, and durations.  </s>
<s> It does not provide built-in types for lengths, weights, voltages, or temperatures.  </s>
<s> It is reasonable for a query language built around the type system of XML Schema to provide operations on the built-in Schema types and not on other types.  </s>
<s> It makes sense to subtract two dates, or to add a duration to a time.  </s>
<s> XQuery and XPath-2 reasonably support these operations, as users would expect.  </s>
<s> Here's a second reason: SQL, which also has built-in types for dates, times, and durations, has supported arithmetic operations on these types for a quarter century.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of experience with date/time arithmetic in the database community, and there is a lot of stored data that uses dates, times, and durations.  </s>
<s> I do not think that users will take kindly to a new query language that considers the difference between two dates to be a floating point number of seconds.  </s>
<s> I think that XQuery and XPath-2 should provide support for dates and times that is similar to that provided by other query languages.  </s>
<s> Here's a third reason: Your proposal in contains a function named op:add-seconds-to-date($arg1 as xs:date, $arg2 as xs:double).  </s>
<s> I assume from the "op:" prefix that this function implements the "+" operator between the types xs:date and xs:double.  </s>
<s> But I am very suspicious of the expression xs:date("2003-11-30") + 47.  </s>
<s> That looks like a type error to me and I would expect my system to warn me about it.  </s>
<s> If I understand your proposal, this expression is valid and returns the date 2003-11-30 since 47 seconds is less than one day.  </s>
<s> This kind of thing seems dangerous to me.  </s>
<s> I think we can do better.  </s>

<s> One of the fundamental insights that came from my colleagues in Darmstadt was that the justification for duration data types is because durations are difficult, but we have restricted ourselves to handling only those durations that are easy, in which case the justification for having special data types disappears.  </s>
<s> JM Consider two values of type xs:duration under Mike's proposal.  </s>

<s> What is the result of comparing $dur1 and $dur2?  </s>
<s> It is not possible to determine this unambiguously.  </s>
<s> The reason is simple: We do not know how many days there are in a month!  </s>
<s> Some months have 31 days, others have either 28 or 29 days (depending on the year involved).  </s>
<s> Therefore, the expression "30*24*60*60" may or may not equal 1 month.  </s>
<s> Consequently, the type xs:duration is *not* totally ordered.  </s>
<s> That means, of course, that some pairs of values, such as fn:make-duration(2, 0) and $dur2, from fn:make-duration(1, 1*24*60*60), can be compared without ambiguity (2 months is greater than 1 month and 1 day), while others cannot.  </s>
<s> The existing F&amp;O specification that introduces and uses the two xdt: types avoid the mixing of year-month durations and day-time durations specifically because of this problem.  </s>
<s> In Mike's proposal, he suggests (in changes to Annex C.5) that one could define comparison of two values of type xs:duration by comparing their months values and also comparing their seconds values and require that both must be equal in order for the result of the comparison to indicate equality.  </s>
<s> But he admits that greater than and less than comparisons are more problematic because of the partially-ordered nature of xs:duration.  </s>
<s> He suggests a pragmatic solution that uses 365.242199 as the average number of days in a year.  </s>
<s> That works well when the values involves are intended for statistical use (e.g., over thousands, probably even hundreds, of years), but they don't work nearly as well for computations involving one year or two years or 1 month!  </s>
<s> MK The key point of my proposal in this area is that mixed durations are indeed problematic, and that our two new data types do nothing to help the user in handling them, and because they don't help with the problem, they serve no useful purpose.  </s>
<s> By contrast, if complex durations are represented as a pair of numbers, there are various algorithms the user could employ to make them tractable, some of which might meet the needs of some applications.  </s>

<s> JM In short (in case I have not been clear), I cannot support, and will oppose, acceptance of this proposal on the grounds that it quite often makes the application/query authors' lives more difficult, raises the probability of errors that will result in support costs borne by vendors, and loses the safety provided by the xdt: types, all in the goal of simplifying the lives of the authors of the XQuery/XPath suite of documents.  </s>
<s> MK I emphatically do NOT try to justify the proposal on the basis that it makes the lives of implementors and specifiers easier.  </s>
<s> The key point about the proposal is that it makes the language significantly smaller without removing any useful functionality, and that this actually makes the users' lives easier.  </s>

<s> So why don't we have special data types for lengths, weights, voltages, and temperatures?  </s>
<s> None of this reasoning convinces me that durations are any different from other units of measure, or that there is a good case for treating them differently.  </s>
<s> Here's one reason: XML Schema provides built-in types for dates, times, and durations.  </s>
<s> It does not provide built-in types for lengths, weights, voltages, or temperatures.  </s>
<s> It is reasonable for a query language built around the type system of XML Schema to provide operations on the built-in Schema types and not on other types.  </s>
<s> It makes sense to subtract two dates, or to add a duration to a time.  </s>
<s> XQuery and XPath-2 reasonably support these operations, as users would expect.  </s>
<s> If XQuery and XPath2 did support xs:duration, I would have some sympathy with this argument.  </s>
<s> But we don't.  </s>
<s> We have invented our own types instead.  </s>
<s> And these types are unnecessary, for the same reason that types to represent lengths, weights, and voltages are unnecessary: they are all simple numeric quantities.  </s>
<s> Here's a second reason: SQL, which also has built-in types for dates, times, and durations, has supported arithmetic operations on these types for a quarter century.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of experience with date/time arithmetic in the database community, and there is a lot of stored data that uses dates, times, and durations.  </s>
<s> I do not think that users will take kindly to a new query language that considers the difference between two dates to be a floating point number of seconds.  </s>
<s> I think that XQuery and XPath-2 should provide support for dates and times that is similar to that provided by other query languages.  </s>
<s> That may be an argument for people who want to use XQuery in conjunction with relational databases.  </s>
<s> But there are many who don't.  </s>
<s> And the same argument could be applied to any other language with which coexistence is desirable.  </s>
<s> SQL's type system suffered historically because of attempts to align it with COBOL and PL/I, and this legacy is still with us.  </s>
<s> It has many features, like fixed-length character strings, that we are (fortunately) not attempting to emulate.  </s>
<s> Here's a third reason: Your proposal in contains a function named op:add-seconds-to-date($arg1 as xs:date, $arg2 as xs:double).  </s>
<s> I assume from the "op:" prefix that this function implements the "+" operator between the types xs:date and xs:double.  </s>
<s> But I am very suspicious of the expression xs:date("2003-11-30") + 47.  </s>
<s> That looks like a type error to me and I would expect my system to warn me about it.  </s>
<s> If I understand your proposal, this expression is valid and returns the date 2003-11-30 since 47 seconds is less than one day.  </s>
<s> This kind of thing seems dangerous to me.  </s>
<s> I think we can do better.  </s>
<s> I chose to stick with operators because I felt they would be more acceptable to the majority.  </s>
<s> My own preference is actually to use functions, especially if we can come up with names for the functions that are short and pithy: months-between() would be so much more usable than subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration().  </s>
<s> It would be easier to have shorter names, of course, if we allowed some overloading.  </s>
<s> Since we overload numeric functions, I don't see a very good reason why we can't overload date/time functions in the same way.  </s>

<s> JM I think it's fair to summarize Mike's proposal in [1] thus: eliminate all uses of the xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration types, as well as the types themselves, and replace them with operations involving only the existing xs:duration type.  </s>
<s> There are, of course, a number of details in the proposal in support of the high-level goal.  </s>
<s> JM Now, my principle reason for objecting to this direction is based on the complexity that Mike rightfully deplores.  </s>
<s> He proposes that we simplify the specifications for various documents in the XQuery/XPath suite and the lives if the WG members working on those documents.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my two decades of experience in this area has convinced me that this has the unfortunate side effect of saddling the users (the query writers, that is) with solving the problems that Mike observes to be so complicated in the XQuery/XPath documents.  </s>
<s> MK I don't think this is true.  </s>
<s> I think that very many of the functions and operators we are providing are straight duplicates of what you could do more simply with regular arithmetic.  </s>
<s> Certainly, adding, multiplying, comparing, and sorting durations expressed as a number of seconds or as a number of months is not difficult.  </s>
<s> By asking users to do these operations in the same way as they manipulate lengths, weights, or numbers of paperclips, we are making their lives easier, not harder.  </s>
<s> The only things that are special and difficult about durations are (a) the interaction between month-durations and second-durations (which is a problem we have washed our hands of), and (b) computations that combine dates (and times) with durations, where the Software AG proposal retains the functionality of the current specification.  </s>
<s> JM I am unwilling to require tens of thousands of query writers to figure out how to deal with an issue that was deemed unsolvable by the 30 or 40 people in the world who are most expert in the subject of XQuery and XPath.  </s>
<s> If we, the members of the XQuery WG, have so much difficulty getting this right, how many thousands of errors, subtle and devious, will be produced by query authors who are trying to solve their business problems but are forced to solve data type problems instead?  </s>
<s> MK I would like to see concrete examples.  </s>
<s> I think that getting rid of all these functions makes users' lives easier.  </s>
<s> For example, it's not at all obvious to the casual reader that the operation to multiply a duration by a number is not what they need when calculating how much to pay someone who has worked for four hours at a rate of $10 per hour.  </s>
<s> In fact, I think it's quite hard for that user to wade through our list of dozens of functions and discover that none of them meets this need.  </s>
<s> If the duration was represented by a number, like every other quantity, then the difficulty would not arise.  </s>
<s> JM In many ways, Mike's proposal is attractive.  </s>
<s> On the surface, it appears to simplify a lot of things.  </s>
<s> For example, it removes a large number of functions from the F&amp;O specification [3] (as well as removing a number of lines from various tables).  </s>
<s> As somebody employed by an XQuery implementor, I am concerned (as is, of course, Mike) with having such a large number of functions to specify, implement, test, and document.  </s>
<s> However, I much more concerned with having to deal with what will be (in my opinion) a significant number of support calls related to user-written bugs that might be avoided by supporting durations natively in XQuery.  </s>
<s> JM It is true that an *implementation* of XQuery might choose to represent a value of type xdt:yearMonthDuration as an integer number of months and a value of type xdt:dayTimeDuration as a decimal number of seconds.  </s>
<s> And it is also true that an *implementation* of XQuery (and of XML Schema) might choose to represent a value of type xs:duration as a 2-tuple containing the number of months and the number of seconds.  </s>
<s> But I disagree that such a representation is the right paradigm to present to our users.  </s>
<s> In fact, the XML Schema WG is believed to be considering the xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration types for inclusion in a future version of the XML Schema Recommendation.  </s>
<s> To me, that suggests that data type experts are concerned with the practical use of xs:duration.  </s>
<s> (Full disclosure: I have argued that the XML Schema WG adopt the xdt: types related to durations for reasons closely related to my positions in this message.) JM I believe that the reality of the situation is that durations are a useful type, one whose values have particular semantics that should be observed on their own, without being manipulated in some other surrogate form.  </s>
<s> Yes, of course it is possible to use numerics as a surrogate for durations --- and for dateTime value as well.  </s>
<s> It's possible to do so with character strings, too.  </s>
<s> (The proof is that all computers do exactly this internally...the one, two, or more 8-bit bytes used to represent a character is nothing but a binary number.) But characters and character strings are sufficiently useful that nobody seriously proposes that they be handled as numbers.  </s>
<s> Of course, character strings are pretty well understood by most people (although Unicode has offered some challenges to some of those people), while durations are inherently more complex.  </s>
<s> MK So why don't we have special data types for lengths, weights, voltages, and temperatures?  </s>
<s> None of this reasoning convinces me that durations are any different from other units of measure, or that there is a good case for treating them differently.  </s>
<s> If we did really clever things with "complex" durations (those that mix months and seconds), then there might be some argument.  </s>
<s> But we've decided not to handle complex durations, and only handle those that map trivially to numbers: which means, as I see it, that our data types are not adding any value.  </s>
<s> JM Let's look at a detail or two.  </s>
<s> In [1], Mike uses this example: A dateTime with lexical representation 1999-05-31T13:20:00-05:00 has a value represented by the tuple (1999-05-31T18:20:00Z, -18000) JM I consider myself fairly adept at mental arithmetic, but I have to pause for awhile to figure out that "-18000" means "Eastern Standard Time" in the USA, Canada, and probably other locations --- in other words, that it means "-05:00", or "5 timezones to the west of UTC".  </s>
<s> In fairness, Mike has not proposed that the lexical representation of the time zone component of an xs:dateTime be changed.  </s>
<s> But he does propose that the *value space* representation be changed to a number of seconds, and it is the value space representation that application/query writers have to manipulate.  </s>
<s> MK Well, there is at least one country in the world that still uses non-metric units for lengths.  </s>
<s> If you're going to manipulate lengths in feet and inches, then you're going to have to get used to doing a lot of arithmetic to convert between different representations of a length.  </s>
<s> I ask the question again: why are durations different?  </s>
<s> And if you don't like using constants like -18000, it's easy to write them as variables ($TZ:EDT, for example) or as expressions (for example: tz(-5)).  </s>
<s> JM Mike also proposes that: The elapsed time between two dates, times, or dateTimes is generally handled as a number of seconds, expressed as an xs:double.  </s>
<s> Some functions are also provided that manipulate a duration as an integer number of months.  </s>
<s> All arithmetic, comparison, and sorting of durations is achieved by expressing the duration as an xs:integer number of months plus an xs:double number of seconds, and then manipulating these values using conventional numeric arithmetic.  </s>
<s> JM As I said above, this is a perfectly reasonable mechanism for implementations to use internally.  </s>
<s> But I believe that it is generally awkward and confusing to have humans manipulate this notation for a data type that inherently has structure to it.  </s>
<s> Quick now, what is the difference between 11:00 and 17:00?  </s>
<s> Six hours, right?  </s>
<s> Sure, that's the same as 21600 seconds, but why is that important in this particular calculation?  </s>
<s> MK Well, having calculated the difference, what are you going to do with it?  </s>
<s> If you want to display it as "six hours", then I would suggest that translating "PT6H" to "six hours" is likely to be just as difficult as translating "21600".  </s>
<s> If you want to do anything with the result other than display it (for example, to calculate the average speed over your journey, or to plot it on a graph in SVG), then the value 21600 is much more useful to you than the value PT6H.  </s>
<s> JM Worse, imagine having to write a query that asks "What is the sum of 3 hours 45 minutes and 4 hours 15 minutes?"  </s>
<s> Should a query writer have to first translate each of the values into a numeric value, then perform the addition, then transform the result back into a duration?  </s>
<s> Or would the query writer be better off with merely adding the two values together?  </s>
<s> Consider the following examples (which I have sincerely attempted to write fairly).  </s>
<s> Assume that an XQuery variable $dur1 contains the first value, 3 hours 45 minutes, and another variable $dur2 contains the second value, 4 hours 45 minutes.  </s>
<s> (In the existing F&amp;O specification, the types of $dur1 and $dur2 would be xdt:dayTimeDuration; under Mike's proposal, both would have the type xs:duration.)

<s> In Mike's proposal, he suggests (in changes to Annex C.5) that one could define comparison of two values of type xs:duration by comparing their months values and also comparing their seconds values and require that both must be equal in order for the result of the comparison to indicate equality.  </s>
<s> But he admits that greater than and less than comparisons are more problematic because of the partially-ordered nature of xs:duration.  </s>
<s> He suggests a pragmatic solution that uses 365.242199 as the average number of days in a year.  </s>
<s> That works well when the values involves are intended for statistical use (e.g., over thousands, probably even hundreds, of years), but they don't work nearly as well for computations involving one year or two years or 1 month!  </s>
<s> MK The key point of my proposal in this area is that mixed durations are indeed problematic, and that our two new data types do nothing to help the user in handling them, and because they don't help with the problem, they serve no useful purpose.  </s>
<s> By contrast, if complex durations are represented as a pair of numbers, there are various algorithms the user could employ to make them tractable, some of which might meet the needs of some applications.  </s>
<s> If you've got a pair of numbers, the problem is probably easier to deal with than if you've got a (xdt:yearMonthDuration, xdt:dayMonthDuration) pair.  </s>
<s> JM In short (in case I have not been clear), I cannot support, and will oppose, acceptance of this proposal on the grounds that it quite often makes the application/query authors' lives more difficult, raises the probability of errors that will result in support costs borne by vendors, and loses the safety provided by the xdt: types, all in the goal of simplifying the lives of the authors of the XQuery/XPath suite of documents.  </s>
<s> MK I emphatically do NOT try to justify the proposal on the basis that it makes the lives of implementors and specifiers easier.  </s>
<s> The key point about the proposal is that it makes the language significantly smaller without removing any useful functionality, and that this actually makes the users' lives easier.  </s>
<s> Thanks for giving the proposal such careful attention!  </s>
