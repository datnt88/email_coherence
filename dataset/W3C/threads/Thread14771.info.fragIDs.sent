<s> I appreciate the urgency of the desire for absolute clarity.  </s>
<s> But, like other forms of perfection, it's not achievable in human terms.  </s>
<s> Language is a complex adaptive system; it thrives, and serves us, precisely because it's situated where complexity is always situated: right on the boundary between order and chaos, where life itself occurs.  </s>
<s> I would argue that a drive of the sort that Lisa suggests here is actually *productive* of ambiguity.  </s>
<s> In English at least, efforts like this date back at least to the 16th century, to the inherently undecidable debate between adherents of "plain style" and adherents to a more ornamental rhetoric.  </s>
<s> Probably the most influential version of the debate was shaped by the formation of the British Royal Society in the 17th century, some of whose members sought to shape the language such that for every "thing" there would be one, and only one, word.  </s>
<s> People interested in more contemporary manifestations of this effort as it pertains to comptuer science and the problems of translation might be interested in the work of Douglas Hofstadter, beginning with _Godel, Escher, Bach_ (1979) and _Metamagical Themas_ (collected Scientific American columns, 1985), and _Le Ton Beau de Marot: In praise of the music of lanuage_ (1997).  </s>

<s> of course been numerous studies conducted on simplifying languages.  </s>
<s> A good  </s>
<s> starting point is the AECMA's "Simplified English":- also: http://www.aecma.org/Publications/SEnglish/sengbrc.htm which is all well and good, but is aimed towards people who have a relatively high understanding of English in the first place, and can spend  </s>
<s> the time and effort working on a simplified vocabulary; i.e. applies to a  </s>
<s> minute fraction of the population.  </s>
<s> But onto more promising avenues of discussion.  </s>
<s> I like the DAML (http://www.daml.org/tools/)  </s>
<s> approach of having content forms, where people  </s>
<s> can create homepage metadata by searching and/or selecting (Prof.  </s>
<s> Jim Hendler has talked about this).  </s>
<s> It was also one of the aims of UWIMP, which  </s>
<s> is the service that William and I planned many months ago.  </s>
<s> If we are to create William's much prophecized ambient information space,  </s>
<s> it must be possible for the people with the information to publish what they know with minimal costs and maximum benefits to them.  </s>
<s> This is only going to be possible through small incremental changes, although if some  </s>
<s> organization like Google or Alexa gave over their already vast data stores  </s>
<s> to the Web community, that would help a lot (why pay for a server when Google and Alexa index it for free anyway?).  </s>
<s> It's an ongoing battle.  </s>
<s> Metadata formats such as RDF are there to help too,  </s>
<s> and a standardized deployment of RDF-in/from-HTML is long overdue (hopefully not another manifestation of the six month phenomenon).  </s>
<s> RDF is  </s>
<s> good because the Semantic part of the Semantic Web is there to satisfy the  </s>
<s> (much ballyhooed) "semantic pragmatic" nature of machines.  </s>
<s> But marking up text itself to be "unambiguous" is rather HumanMLish in character... the waste of time criticisms are justifiable for corollaries  </s>
<s> of "the language moves faster than the editor".  </s>
<s> Not only that, but language  </s>
<s> is art - if you move towards unambiguity, you may lose the essence of many  </s>
<s> of the great works.  </s>
