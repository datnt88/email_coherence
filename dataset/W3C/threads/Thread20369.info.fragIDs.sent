<s> When a Mathml document (.mml) includes characters ' ' or &amp; (within a comment by example) the current version 4.3.2 of Amaya doesn't export these characters as entities  &amp;amp; To fix that bug we encourage people to replace their current file Amaya/amaya/MathMLT.TRA by the new version available on our Web server (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/MathMLT.TRA)  </s>
<s> It looks like this only fixes installed copies of Amaya.  </s>
<s> Will you be rerolling the distribution or putting up a source patchfile as well?  </s>
<s> I've always wanted to be a dilettante, but I've never quite been ready to make the commitment.  </s>
<s> We cannot patch the current delivered version.  </s>
<s> The version 4.3.2 must be the same for everybody.  </s>
<s> Just after the release we started important developments and we need time to obtain a new stable version.  </s>
