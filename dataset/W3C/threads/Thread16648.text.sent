Regarding acronyms in XHTML... Acronyms are meant to be pronounced, yes? 
I was just wondering what the default behaviour was for them in screen readers, e.g. faced with:- Would it attempt to say "earl" or "eee ay ar ell"? 
If it tries to pronounce it (which I believe is correct), then what happens if the acronym could have an ambiguous spelling? 
For example, acronym EARL /acronym uses acronym URL /acronym s. [Obviously all of these examples should have titles as well.] 
Maybe the screen reader should spell it out on request, but otherwise pronounce it... This has probably been discussed a thousand times before... Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

Stop right there -- that's not clear at all. 
There is no consensus that anything marked up with the acronym tag is meant to be pronounced in any given manner in any given language. 
Yes, and inconclusively so. 
There is no link between acronym and any given pronunciation of the content of the element. 
There is currently no way to mark up a specific pronunciation for any text in (X)HTML. 
Your question can be applied equally to non-acronym text as well: Do I spell 'wright' the write way when I right it with my rite hand?
