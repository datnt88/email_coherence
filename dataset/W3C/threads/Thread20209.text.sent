Do you intend to distribute an IRIX 6.x version of Amaya 2.2? 
This is the first time it has been missing from the binary ditribution list. 
Also the source link is still version 2.1. 
Roy Platon I found that, but a reload fixed it.

I don't have any access to a IRIX box now. 
Perhaps some of you can build it and make the tar file free available for others.
