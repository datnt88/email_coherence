Hi, I've been asked to track down a robust example of CSS for screen readers. 
Could someone point me to an example like this? 
Thanks very much, Scott Unfortunately I do not properly understand what you are seeking. 
If you are referring to ACSS, then the only implementation of which I am aware is T.V. Raman's Emacspeak in cooperation with the W3 browser. 
The latter includes a default style sheet which specifies certain ACSS properties. 
To avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, I would suggest that Emacspeak and similar software, which interprets the markup together with audio style sheets, should not be referred to as a "screen reader", since its function is not to read the screen but rather to produce an audio representation of the document. 
It constitutes an "audio formatter" in T.V. Raman's sense of the term. 
Hi, I'm not looking for the ACSS, but rather a CSS which will make a web page easier for a blind person using a screen reader. 
Scott One example is that in browsers that can ignore CSS (through either design or user option) CSS based spatial formatting can be eliminted. 
Visual button effects can also be created in style sheets, so people do not have to use GIF images to create the effects. 
A URL to an example follows: The Trace Center may also have examples, contact Wendy Chisholm.
