RDF IG, Forwarding (see attached) Carine's draft to the W3C Web Services public discussion list of a 'Semantic Web Interest Group' charter. 
I'm copying the SWAD-Europe list too since we're looking into doing further work in this area. 
The original thread (useful for tracking followups) is archived at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws/2003Mar/0028.html 
I sent my notes on this proposal last week, see (drop/keep CC: list in followups according to taste...) 
I'd be interested to hear views from RDF Interest Group members on this proposal. 
It connects also to our own need to start thinking about the future of the RDF IG over the coming years, and about priorities for future work within W3C. 
Do people here see "SW Services" as the next big thing? 
As a blue skies research area? 
As ripe for standardisation? 
If there were an Interest Group, or Working Group, or 'taskforce' or mailing list devoted to this topic, would you be interested in participation? 
I'm more 
interested to learn about people's interest levels than go into detail of W3C process decisions (WG vs IG vs mailing list) at this stage. 
In general, is this an area that RDF / Semantic Web developers feel would benefit from some special attention and support? 
Do you have running code and burning questions? 
Test cases and usage scenarios to share? 
Services up and running already? 
Ideas about business models and their interaction with technology/standardisation issues? 
Do let us know what you think! 
Carine initially solicited feedback via www-ws@w3.org 
so you could send mail there too, I'll certainly send a pointer to that list of any discussions here. 
cheers, Dan (RDF Interest Group chair) After Hugo's report on the BOF during the technical plenary meeting[1] I made the draft charter of a "Semantic Web Services Interest Group" publicly available at: Please review this DRAFT, express your comments &amp; thoughts here on the www-ws@w3.org 
list! 
(sample questions: Is this a good idea to create an IG? 
Is the scope well-defined? 
Would you prefer a WS-IG rather than a SWS-IG? 
Would you participate in such an IG? What would you expect from it?...) Thanks.

Hi Dan, 
I believe that SW Services will be 'the next big thing', simply because it offers an opportunity to reconcile the two main - but largely disparate - areas of Web development. 
I'd be interested in participating, as I suspect would several of my colleagues. 
Although much of the groundwork for SWS has been laid (in terms of deployed WS and SW technologies and incipient SWS technologies such as DAML-S), I think that any attempt to standardise within the short to medium term (two years) would be rather premature. 
Perhaps go for an interim SWAD-style effort as a bridge between blue skies and the standards track? 
In addition to the aforementioned DAML Services, there are other projects in the SW/WS intersection, of which the Semantic Grid[1] is a good example. 
Finally, it may be worth widening this tentative call for participation to the multi-agent systems community since their work has some strong resonances with SWS development (as we outline in [2]).

We are actively involved in developing and deploying within a major consumer packaged goods company 'semantic web services' in which we are using DAML and WSDL-based services to allow businesses to communicate cross-enterprise. 
We are very interested in a SW Services interest group and aligning with others in promoting standardization.

IMO, semantic web services are critical in areas like Web service discovery and orchestration. 
Additionally, I believe web services in general are a catalyst to other semantic web activities as they increase organizational awareness of open, layered metadata and the potential for semantic interoperability (as opposed to syntactic interoperability). 
It is that potential that makes the next step from web services to semantic web services both obvious and desirable. 
So, in essence, Semantic Web services may well be the watershed event to the larger vision of the semantic web. 
I would definitely be interested in participation.

Hi, I was wondering if there had been any developments on this as the DotGNU project appears to be navigating directly into these waters. 
From the latest post on their list: 
I suppose DGEE [DotGNU Execution Environment] makes use of service 
discovery? 
It will do. 
Right now it's just the execution container - ie the place where webservices are actually found - with discovery ability coming as and when ready (ie when there is something to discover :o) 
Does it use RDF? 
Internally no. Externally, almost. 
The DGEE will export information about its webservices in XML, RDF and other formats - I just need an RDF fragment suitable for representing DGEE webservice info and we're off! 
(btw, I've suggested DAML-S as a possibility - anything else?) Cheers, Danny.
