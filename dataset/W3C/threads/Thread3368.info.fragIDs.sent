<s> Hi Dan,  </s>
<s> I believe that SW Services will be 'the next big thing', simply because it offers an opportunity to reconcile the two main - but largely disparate - areas of Web development.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested in participating, as I suspect would several of my colleagues.  </s>
<s> Although much of the groundwork for SWS has been laid (in terms of deployed WS and SW technologies and incipient SWS technologies such as DAML-S), I think that any attempt to standardise within the short to medium term (two years) would be rather premature.  </s>
<s> Perhaps go for an interim SWAD-style effort as a bridge between blue skies and the standards track?  </s>
<s> In addition to the aforementioned DAML Services, there are other projects in the SW/WS intersection, of which the Semantic Grid[1] is a good example.  </s>
<s> Finally, it may be worth widening this tentative call for participation to the multi-agent systems community since their work has some strong resonances with SWS development (as we outline in [2]).  </s>

<s> We are actively involved in developing and deploying within a major consumer packaged goods company 'semantic web services' in which we are using DAML and WSDL-based services to allow businesses to communicate cross-enterprise.  </s>

<s> IMO, semantic web services are critical in areas like Web service discovery and orchestration.  </s>
<s> Additionally, I believe web services in general are a catalyst to other semantic web activities as they increase organizational awareness of open, layered metadata and the potential for semantic interoperability (as opposed to syntactic interoperability).  </s>
<s> It is that potential that makes the next step from web services to semantic web services both obvious and desirable.  </s>
<s> So, in essence, Semantic Web services may well be the watershed event to the larger vision of the semantic web.  </s>
<s> I would definitely be interested in participation.  </s>

<s> Hi, I was wondering if there had been any developments on this as the DotGNU project appears to be navigating directly into these waters.  </s>
<s> From the latest post on their list:  </s>
<s> I suppose DGEE [DotGNU Execution Environment] makes use of service  </s>
<s> discovery?  </s>
<s> It will do.  </s>
<s> Right now it's just the execution container - ie the place where webservices are actually found - with discovery ability coming as and when ready (ie when there is something to discover :o)  </s>
<s> Does it use RDF?  </s>
<s> Internally no. Externally, almost.  </s>
<s> The DGEE will export information about its webservices in XML, RDF and other formats - I just need an RDF fragment suitable for representing DGEE webservice info and we're off!  </s>
<s> (btw, I've suggested DAML-S as a possibility - anything else?) Cheers, Danny.  </s>
