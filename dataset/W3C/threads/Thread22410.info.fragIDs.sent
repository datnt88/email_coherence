<s> Another weak point in the spec is with entities.  </s>

<s> Period.  </s>

<s> It may also make sense to include an enum that  </s>

<s> You're right; the EntityDeclaration object needs the public and system identifiers.  </s>
<s> It shall be proposed to the WG ...  </s>

<s> As I understand it, internal entities are expanded by an XML processor, so the DOM never sees them.  </s>
<s> You're right about needing a Parsed/Unparsed attribute; this was apparently discussed at last week's WG meeting.  </s>

<s> Understandable.  </s>
<s> But what if the DOM forms the core of the XML processor implementation?  </s>
<s> It should be possible to reproduce an ENTIRE document, not just an intermediate representation of a document.  </s>
<s> Consider the  </s>
<s> following: documentA - processor - DOM - generator - documentB Assuming no limitations on the part of the processor or generator, documentA and documentB, the DOM should not prevent documentA and documentB from being identical.  </s>
<s> Also, it might make sense to differentiate between general entities and parameter entities since there are significant differences in their behavior.  </s>
<s> I'm talking about separate interfaces, not just a "type" identifier.  </s>

<s> You're right; I've come to realize that I was extrapolating too far from the DOM draft spec's statement on entity handling in core in my previous reply.  </s>
<s> I'm speaking for myself since it's clear that this is not clearly laid out in the spec, but from some informal consultations on this I think it's clear that we need to a) clarify the relationship between DOM and the XML processor and b)we need to put type information on the EntityDeclaration object so that the DOM user can tell what it is and where the declaration was found.  </s>
