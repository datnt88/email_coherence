Hello, At last week's meeting, I took an action to update the draft conformance section based on discussion. 
It is attached. 
Major changes: 
1. added "Best Practice items to do not need to be met to claim conformance to a Checkpoint." to explanations of Core and Extended. 
2. added summary of issues with Core+ to bullet 4 of "Conformance Claims" --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium

Hi Wendy, all, Just a quick thought. 
We are all well aware that one of the problems of expressing conformance to WCAG 1.0 was "how do I explain this to a non-technical person" (e.g. legislator, politician, manager, etc.). 
The different drafts of WCAG 2.0 seem to become more and more cumbersome in this issue. 
We shall probably start to think that we are not writing for ourselves, as the abstract says "... and to use wording that may be understood by a more varied audience." 
In Germany, WCAG 1.0 has been adopted as legislation, combining WCAG 1.0 A and AA into Priority 1 items, and AAA as Priority 2 (almost). 
We have discussed this issue with people involved in the legal process, and basically, there is no chance a legal document can deal with A Conformance, A+ Conformance, AA- Conformance and so on (not to mention Core+1, Core+2, etc.). 
In Europe, most countries are adopting or intend to adopt WCAG in one way or another. 
And they want to update to WCAG 2.0, when the moment comes (at least, in Germany). 
Conformance is a key issue, and we shall make it simpler. 2 (Euro-)cents from an outsider.

Hi Carlos. 
Countries could just say that they require WCAG Core or higher.

I agree with Gregg. 
The problem now in Europe is that in some countries (like Italy) some part of the government wanna create normative "section 508-like" and not the full receipt of the WCAG. 
Also, i remember that in the European Community pages [1] talks about "WAI" that is not only WCAG :)

Then _they_ should specify a conformance profile, and they should specify _which_ checkpoints over and above Core. 
No self-respecting organization is going to issue a content requirement that allows people to select items "a la carte" to implement. 
If they're going to make laws out of WCAG, they should select and require items in the extended set when they do it. 
Core will be the most important set. 
From there, I think the focus should be on telling potential adopters (governmental and institutional) to start with nothing less than Core, and add requirements from there. 
Core+ does not help. 
As far as 508 goes, I think we'd do well to create a Core+508 profile as an informative example. 
We could show that adopting our requirements and processes will allow authors and ER tools to state authoritatively, "this is 508", while still adopting the principles of good design that WCAG contains (and 508 leaves out).

Interesting idea that last one. 
(WCAG 2.O+508) Have to ponder that one. 
Does it imply 508 and 2.0 are different --- or that 508 is a variant of 2.0 - or superset -- or.... hmmm Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Ind. Engr.

Hum.... i think if we "adapt" the WCAG to the 508, for the same we need to adapt the WCAG to all the local countries normative but - as had said during a meeting in Venice Daniel Dardailler - local government representative must be involved in the working group and the WCAG must be "the document". 
In Italy there is a discussion that said that with WCAG 1.0 is difficoult to apply a law, due to the impossibility to verify some checkpoints: with WCAG 2.0 we need to create a real "conformance matrix", where could be possible 
for the local government (or their "certificator representative) to simply translate (but sounds be good that local office of W3C make an official translation of the normative document) and apply the WCAG.

I don't propose adapting WCAG to 508. 
But WCAG 2 is working on what 508 is missing: objective, testable requirements that authors can use. 
If we can produce a document that lets people say with confidence that they did 508, I consider that a step forward. 
This would be a step toward harmonizing Web development processes by pointing out that if you learn accessibility with WCAG, you can design content that conforms to a range of existing policies. 
Presently, one of the most common questions I get is "should I do 508 or WCAG?", and I don't want to have to hear that anymore.

Roberto: Yes... it is the problem that I think that we will have in the european countries, due to the difficoult to armonize the normative to the actual WCAG 1.0. 
I assume the following is a typo (this occurs in both dd items defining core and extended checkpoints). 
"Best Practice items to do not need to be met..." Explanation of extended checkpoints is difficult to understand. 
Item #1. 
Current wording: "No conformance claim of any kind may be made..." Proposal: Change to positive statement: "In order to make a valid conformance claim for a Web resource, the resource must satisfy all required success criteria for all Core checkpoints." 
Or "A Web resource must satisfy all required success criteria for all core checkpoints in order for a conformance claim to be valid." 
Rationale: the negative form of the current wording is difficult to parse (e.g., for non-native speakers and possibly for people with reading difficulties). 
Item #2 Current wording: "If all ... Then a claim ..." Proposed: "A conformance claim of "WCAG 2.0 Core" can be made if all required success criteria for all core checkpoints have been met." Rationale: To improve readability by simplifying the syntax. 
Item #3: Same as #2. 
Item #4: Ditto. 
Finally, it's not clear who the audience for the remarks under "Sites that conform to WCAG 1.0" is. 
Reads like an internal note to WG members, or like the hwole thing is a reviewer's note... Hope this helps.

draft Dear Roberto, It is not a matter of recipes, but a matter of legal language (in which I am not by far an expert) and facilitating implementation. 
As someone said, we are not the United States of Europe, and that is also a problem. 
What you are saying is that is OK to have 15 (25 now) Section-508s (one implementing Core, another Core+2, another Core+4, etc.). 
IMHO that is something we have to avoid, as it is a real problem for Authoring Tool developers, E&amp;R tools, etc. Roberto: Yes, we are not the United States of Europe but the European Commission give directives to all the member states: if the EU will make a directive more strong that the eEurope Project, the country that don't conform to these guidelines - as for all the other directives - receive some recall (they must, for ex. pay some money, etc.). 
If with the develop of WCAG 2.0 we create a full checklist divide in "Core" and "Extended", and the "Core" section is all "checkable", the W3C with the support of other organization and initiatives (like euroaccessibility.org) can involve the EU Commission to make a directive about this. 
This is not only an european problems: the standards must be receipted by the local states "as is" otherwise there will be problems for Authoring Tool developers, E&amp;R tools and for the users that visit the other countries web sites.
