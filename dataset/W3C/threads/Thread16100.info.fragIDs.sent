<s> Jeff, Scoffing at people who are trying to do the right thing is not a feature of this list, which is nice.  </s>
<s> With regards to XML/XSL so far as I know people are using it internally =and generating HTML to send over the web.  </s>
<s> I use amaya which allows me to save as XHTML - HTML written in XML, and allows for MathML to be included.  </s>
<s> SVG is XML (a graphics format that can be written in a text editor!) and early implementations have been demonstrated at WWW8 last week.  </s>
<s> There are browsers such as indelv wich allow XML/XSL to be used.  </s>
<s> But I don't know of any widespread shipping of XML/XSL to the general public yet.  </s>

<s> I don't think you did.  </s>
<s> Sorry if I sounded like I was coming down on YOU particularly hard either; it wasn't personal, I just feel that it's time that we (all) start debunking the myth (held by others, not you) that accessibility is too hard for so-called web"masters" to fathom.  </s>
