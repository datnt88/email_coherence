Issue: the object element can poiint to a plugin application instead of allowing the user to choose the most useful one. 
Details: According to most guides for using the object element with Internet Explorer, the way to specify multimedia content is to refer to a particular ActiveX control, which specifies the player to be used for the object data. 
For example, there is a classid for the Adobe SVG plugin, and this is what gets specified. 
If a user has an accessibility need for a different plugin (for example a talking plugin), as I understand it they are unable to use that instead without major poking about in the systems innards. 
This contradicts the requirements statement for plugin interfaces It should also, I think, lead to 1. 
A requirement on XHTML 2 to change the way these things are specified 2. A requirement / technique in user agent guidelines that a user can specify the player to be used for a given content type 3. Techniques for WCAG specifying how to mark up content so this is still possible. 
thoughts? 
Charles McCN Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) A similar requirement we considered (but rejected) was "The UA must hand off focus to ATs." This is certainly true, but not strictly an accessibility requirement; it affects anyone who wants to use a plugin. 
This seems more appropriate for /TR/CX or Common User Agent Problems, and as you say, format specifications or XAG. _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

The accessibility requirement is that there are accessibility needs to be able to set up a different plugin that go beyond "I would prefer to use software X". 
I agree that this is a general user problem as well. 
I can also see why people would imagine specifying a particular plugin program is what they want to do, and something stronger than just "be nice to users" is always helpful.

Using a voice plug in with SVG? Probably as useful as the adobe plug in for eyes-free svg access?
