<s> Leonard, I frequently use Publisher to make web pages and have also run into the  </s>
<s> problem of the program converting text boxes to graphics if they are given  </s>
<s> a background color, border, or are physically touching/overlapping any graphic files.  </s>
<s> It also converted a table to graphics, but I'm not sure of  </s>
<s> the reason for that one.  </s>
<s> I usually save the pages as HTML, and when necessary, add/correct HTML  </s>
<s> after Publisher puts it in HTML.  </s>
<s> So far, that has had no effect on whether  </s>
<s> text is displayed as text or a graphic.  </s>
<s> Can you be more specific on how to save the page in HTML to have the text boxes kept as text when the have backgrounds or borders?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Anne  </s>

<s> They're still working on it.  </s>
<s> Actually, what  </s>
<s> we're hitting here is a basic problem of using editors  </s>
<s> which allow the user  </s>
<s> to drag elements around on the screen.  </s>
<s> Here's  </s>
<s> the situation.  </s>
<s> The original problem was that Publisher would  </s>
<s> sometimes render text as  </s>
<s> images.  </s>
<s> Microsoft suggested using the option to  </s>
<s> save as a web page for  </s>
<s> CSS-aware browsers.  </s>
<s> This fixed the problem of  </s>
<s> rendering text as images.  </s>
<s> But the text came out in the  </s>
<s> wrong order.  </s>
<s> The problem is that  </s>
<s> Publisher, like other graphical editors, allows you to  </s>
<s> create a block of  </s>
<s> text and then drag it anywhere you want on the screen  </s>
<s> with the mouse.  </s>
<s> When it creates a web page, it uses style sheets to achieve  </s>
<s> that  </s>
<s> position on the screen.  </s>
<s> But the order that the text appears in the  </s>
<s> HTML  </s>
<s> is something different, (perhaps the order in which it was created...  </s>
<s> this depends  </s>
<s> on how they implemented the editor internally).  </s>
<s> So the reading  </s>
<s> order  </s>
<s> comes out wrong.  </s>
<s> The WAI guidelines anticipated this in checkpoint  </s>
<s> 6.1,  </s>
<s> Quote Organize documents so they may be read without style  </s>
<s> sheets...When content  </s>
<s> is organized logically, it will be rendered in a  </s>
<s> meaningful order when  </s>
<s> style sheets are turned off or not supported.  </s>
<s> Unquote There's a basic difficulty here.  </s>
<s> For example, suppose a user position text blocks A, B, C, D like this: AB CD When the software renders the page there's no way for it to know whether to order it as ABCD or ACBD It's the same sort of problem Adobe Acrobat's HTML generator runs into when it's trying to figure out a logical order from a physical order.  </s>
<s> So what's really needed, when you have a Graphical Authoring Tools that lets the user independenly position elements, is a feature that allows the author to explicitly specify the order in which the elements should be read.  </s>
<s> (It would also be useful to have algorithms, like the ones in the Adobe converter, to make an intial guess.) By the way, even though I'm talking about this in the context of style sheets, it affects any program which allows the user to drag elements around.  </s>
<s> I get the same problem in Powerpoint for example.  </s>
