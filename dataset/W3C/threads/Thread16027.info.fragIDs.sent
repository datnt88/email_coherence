Leonard, I frequently use Publisher to make web pages and have also run into the 
problem of the program converting text boxes to graphics if they are given 
a background color, border, or are physically touching/overlapping any graphic files. 
It also converted a table to graphics, but I'm not sure of 
the reason for that one. 
I usually save the pages as HTML, and when necessary, add/correct HTML 
after Publisher puts it in HTML. 
So far, that has had no effect on whether 
text is displayed as text or a graphic. 
Can you be more specific on how to save the page in HTML to have the text boxes kept as text when the have backgrounds or borders? 
Thanks, Anne 
Cynthia, Yes, Microsoft tried to help me create accessible version of Mi 
c 
Publisher docs, but unfortunately their initial solution 
didn't work 
adequately for out pages. 
They're still working on it. 
Actually, what 
we're hitting here is a basic problem of using editors 
which allow the user 
to drag elements around on the screen. 
Here's 
the situation. 
The original problem was that Publisher would 
sometimes render text as 
images. 
Microsoft suggested using the option to 
save as a web page for 
CSS-aware browsers. 
This fixed the problem of 
rendering text as images. 
But the text came out in the 
wrong order. 
The problem is that 
Publisher, like other graphical editors, allows you to 
create a block of 
text and then drag it anywhere you want on the screen 
with the mouse. 
When it creates a web page, it uses style sheets to achieve 
that 
position on the screen. 
But the order that the text appears in the 
HTML 
is something different, (perhaps the order in which it was created... 
this depends 
on how they implemented the editor internally). 
So the reading 
order 
comes out wrong. 
The WAI guidelines anticipated this in checkpoint 
6.1, 
Quote Organize documents so they may be read without style 
sheets...When content 
is organized logically, it will be rendered in a 
meaningful order when 
style sheets are turned off or not supported. 
Unquote There's a basic difficulty here. 
For example, suppose a user position text blocks A, B, C, D like this: AB CD When the software renders the page there's no way for it to know whether to order it as ABCD or ACBD It's the same sort of problem Adobe Acrobat's HTML generator runs into when it's trying to figure out a logical order from a physical order. 
So what's really needed, when you have a Graphical Authoring Tools that lets the user independenly position elements, is a feature that allows the author to explicitly specify the order in which the elements should be read. 
(It would also be useful to have algorithms, like the ones in the Adobe converter, to make an intial guess.) By the way, even though I'm talking about this in the context of style sheets, it affects any program which allows the user to drag elements around. 
I get the same problem in Powerpoint for example.

We want to publish it on the web.

There are several images.

It seems to depend on exactly where text is placed on the page relative to the images. 
I can't give too many details since it's being done by an outside contractor, not me: but I have seen and verified the result: a bunch of images of text). 
There is a text output, but it's just plain text, no HTML, and no images. 
So it's not the universal HTML output we'd really like. 
Finally, there's acrobat output but, besides the other problems with Acrobat being discussed on this list, the files are huge. 
For example one of our newsletters translates to a 15 mbyte PDF file. 
The text version is only 18 kbytes and there are 5 images and some shaded bars . 
So HTML would probably be a fraction of a MB, much smaller, in addition to being universally accessible. 
Does someone know a way around this? 
For example, another page formatting program that imports Microsoft Publisher and exports better HTML? 
Or some setting in Publisher that guarantees that all text will translate to text, not image? 
Or is there some feature of Microsoft Publisher that we are not using that would help? 
Perhaps some update somewhere?
