Hi! I'd like to thank everyone of the W3C staff who answered our questions during the last weeks. 
Since all questions concerning the copyright of a translation have been answered positively, we will now begin with our translation of XML 1.0 into German. 
If all works fine we will publish a first version within the next week; unfortunately we cannot attend the XML conference :-| But when you return from Seattle you will probably find a German XML translation on the web :-) We have already an URL for the translation: At the moment there's nothing valuable; just an announce... Henning Behme and Stefan Mintert 
BTW: Is there already a page for XML translations at the W3C site? 
(I just know about a page for HTML 4 translations) 
Regards, Stefan.

Hello Stefan, Very glad to hear that you started the XML translation. 
I just had a look at your page at 
There is one problem that has been brought up to W3C staff before, and that may come up again, so I think it is worth discussing it here in the list. 
There is no such thing as an "official" translation of HTML or whatever into language X. 
The W3C does not have the manpower and language expertise to do the checks that would be necessary to give some translation a kind of "official" status. 
The only thing the W3C can do and does is to reserve the right to require corrections or removal of a translation if errors become apparent (see the FAQ at In principle, it is possible to have two translations of the same document into the same language. 
Of course, this is a waste of time, 
and we try to avoid this by providing this list and the respective pages. 
In this connection, the use of the definite article (in languages where this is possible) is also a bit questionable, but as long as there is only one translation, to say that this is *the* translation into a given language is factually true. 
I have initiated that we get one. 
Regards, Martin. 
I'm sorry, Martin, I have fixed this on my pages immediately. 
Perhaps I can change it back to "official", if there should be a decision about an "official" translation in the future. 
Regards, Stefan.
