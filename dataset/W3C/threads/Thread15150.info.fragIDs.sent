<s> My two cents worth, I like seperating them.  </s>
<s> Yes there is overlap, but the seperation brings clarity.  </s>
<s> There are two disitict tasks that need to be done, and they may overlap somtimes, but even when the stucturing of a document does not make it more readabnle for cognitive disabilties - it still needs to be done, for distinc and important resons.  </s>
<s> Yup - skiming and navagatablity and one more - alternitve renderings optermised to the user.  </s>
<s> A distinct structure allows a stuctured rendering , or information fhiding and jumping around the page - all the types of things we are making at SWAP.  </s>
<s> Simply - without it we can not build assistive tecnologies that provide these fetchers.  </s>
<s> 4.1 is somthing of a tricky one, will often be down plaid and misunderstood.  </s>
<s> It will also be as long as the proverbal piece of string in terms of implemtion.  </s>
<s> By adding to it (instaid of "use plain English", "use well structured plain English and expose that structure in the markup"?) are doing exactly what both 3.1 and 4.1 preach against - Muddling Peaple so that we can have less points, less sentences, and save ourselves a full stop or two?  </s>
<s> I think 3.1 will stand a better chance if it goes it alone.  </s>

<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> These are related in the same way that all checkpoints are related, but they are different in terms of implementation.  </s>
<s> They also serve  </s>
<s> different (albeit overlapping) audiences.  </s>
<s> So it makes no sense to me that they be combined - this is a bit like combining textual equivalents and direct accessibility of interactive content.  </s>
<s> cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> I feel we have to better explain where the checkpoints are addressed to structure (markup) and where to content.  </s>
<s> The point is that markup and content have different metods and rules and it's important to specify which are the terms of implementation.  </s>
<s> I also feel that too much overlapping between them could brings to confusion, not clarity.  </s>
<s> So I think that 1.3 needs to explain which is the correct way to use markup, 3.1 is important to know that informations need a solid structure and 4.1 could explain that good structure needs also a good "communication" to reach the state of art (or trying to do it at least).  </s>
<s> To better explain: 1.3 means: "use H1 before H2 and not vice versa" 3.1 means: "before make code or design, make a flowchart and test the information flow, make sense to content" 4.1 means: "explain all with simple words, good communication and correct language (not slang, not words too technical)" What about?  </s>
