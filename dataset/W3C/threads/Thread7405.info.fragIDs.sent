<s> On September 9, 1998, Larry Masinter started a thread titled, "aliasing and other (primarily) editorial issues with -protocol-08", based on discussion  </s>
<s> As you may recall, the issue I raised was one of whether the webdav draft required that a DAV-compliant resource had one, and only one, URI.  </s>
<s> I pointed out the various situations of aliasing, of which 'case sensitive URI' is only one instance, but other kinds of aliasing might also be possible.  </s>
<s> Mark Anderson also touched on this issue in his October 30, 1998 post.  </s>
<s> The core issues here are: a) Can a resource have more than one URI, or does each URI imply a new resource?  </s>
<s> b) If a resource can have more than one URI, the language in the WebDAV spec.  </s>
<s> needs to be more precise in distinguishing between URI and resource.  </s>
<s> In particular, this would be expected to affect the definition of a collection.  </s>
<s> Larry also re-raised this issue in an October 7 email to the list titled "DAV and "one URL per resource"?"  </s>
<s> Despite this, the issue was not substantively addressed in the -09 specification.  </s>
<s> In retrospect, looking at the list traffic, this issue should have been addressed in the -09 revision.  </s>
<s> Larry speaks as chair of the HTTP Working Group and a co-author of the URI syntax specification, after all.  </s>
<s> This message consists of a set of proposed changes to the -09 draft to clarify: a) A resource can have more than one URI.  </s>
<s> b) A collection is a set of URIs, not a set of resources.  </s>
<s> The rest of the modifications are dependent on these clarifications.  </s>
<s> These changes do not introduce any new functional requirements -- they merely clarify and strengthen the discussion of collections, and operations which affect the namespace (MOVE, COPY, PUT, etc.) The intent of this message is to give the working group the opportunity to review these proposed changes -- and only these proposed changes!  </s>
<s> -- before they are added to the draft.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer to hear any comments back by Tuesday, November 10, midnight Pacific time. 3 Terminology URI/URL - As defined in [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> Collection - A resource that contains a set of URIs, termed member URIs, which identify member resources and meets the requirements in section 5 of this specification.  </s>
<s> Member URI - A URI which is a member of the set of URIs contained by a collection.  </s>
<s> Internal Member URI - A Member URI that is immediately relative to the URI of the collection (the definition of immediately relative is given in section 5.2).  </s>
<s> {the remainder of section 3 is unchanged} 5.1 HTTP URL Namespace Model The HTTP URL namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the hierarchy is delimited with the "/" character.  </s>
<s> An HTTP URL namespace is said to be consistent if it meets the following  </s>
<s> conditions: for every URL in the HTTP hierarchy there exists a collection that contains that URL as an internal member.  </s>
<s> The root collection of the namespace is exempt from the previous rule.  </s>
<s> Neither HTTP/1.1 nor WebDAV require that the entire HTTP URL namespace be consistent.  </s>
<s> However, certain WebDAV methods are prohibited from producing results that cause namespace inconsistencies.  </s>
<s> Although implicit in [RFC2068] and [RFC2396], a resource MAY be identified by more than one URI.  </s>
<s> For example, a resource could be identified by multiple HTTP URLs.  </s>
<s> 5.2 Collection Resources A collection is a resource whose state consists of at least a list of internal member URIs and a set of properties, but which may have additional state such as entity bodies returned by GET.  </s>
<s> An internal member URI MUST be immediately relative to the base URI of the collection.  </s>
<s> That is, the internal member URI is equal to the containing collection's URI plus an additional segment for non-collection resources, or additional segment plus trailing slash "/" for collection resources, where segment is defined in section 3.3 of [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> Any given internal member URI MUST only belong to the collection once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple instances of the same URI in a collection.  </s>
<s> Properties defined on collections behave exactly as do properties on non-collection resources.  </s>
<s> For all WebDAV compliant resources A and B, identified by URLs U and V, for which U is immediately relative to V, B MUST be a collection that has U as an internal member URI.  </s>
<s> So, if the resource with URL http://foo.com/bar/blah is WebDAV compliant and if the resource with URL http://foo.com/bar/ is WebDAV compliant then the resource with URL http://foo.com/bar/ must be a collection and must contain URL http://foo.com/bar/blah as an internal member.  </s>
<s> Collection resources MAY list the URLs of non-WebDAV compliant children in the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy as internal members but are not required to do so.  </s>
<s> For example, if the resource with URL http://foo.com/bar/blah is not WebDAV compliant and the URL http://foo.com/bar/ identifies a collection then URL http://foo.com/bar/blah may or may not be an internal member of the collection with URL http://foo.com/bar/.  </s>
<s> {The final three paragraphs of this section are unchanged.}  </s>
<s> If a WebDAV compliant resource has no WebDAV compliant children in the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy then the WebDAV compliant resource is not required to be a collection.  </s>
<s> There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to by its name without a trailing slash, the trailing slash is automatically appended.  </s>
<s> Due to this, a resource may accept a URI without a trailing "/" to point to a collection.  </s>
<s> In this case it SHOULD return a content-location header in the response pointing to the URL ending with the "/".  </s>
<s> For example, if a client invokes a method on http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource invoked on it, and should return a content-location header with collection names.  </s>
<s> A resource MAY be a collection but not be WebDAV compliant.  </s>
<s> That is, the resource may comply with all the rules set out in this specification regarding how a collection is to behave without necessarily supporting all methods that a WebDAV compliant resource is required to support.  </s>
<s> In such a case the resource may return the dav:resourcetype property with the value dav:collection but MUST NOT return a DAV header containing the value "1" on an OPTIONS response.  </s>
<s> 7.5 Write Locks and Collections A write lock on a collection, whether created by a "Depth: 0" or "Depth: infinity" lock request, prevents the addition or removal of member URIs of the collection by non-lock owners.  </s>
<s> As a consequence, when a principal issues a PUT or POST request to create a new resource under a URI which needs to be an internal member of a write locked collection to maintain HTTP namespace consistency, or issues a DELETE to remove a resource which has a URI which is an existing internal member URI of a write locked collection, this request MUST fail if the principal does not have a write lock on the collection.  </s>
<s> However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection containing member URIs identifying resources that are currently locked in a manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request MUST fail with a 423 (Locked) status code.  </s>
<s> If a lock owner causes the URI of a resource to be added as an internal member URI of a locked collection then the new resource MUST be automatically added to the lock.  </s>
<s> This is the only mechanism that allows a resource to be added to a write lock.  </s>
<s> Thus, for example, if the collection /a/b/ is write locked and the resource /c is moved to /a/b/c then resource /a/b/c will be added to the write lock.  </s>
<s> 8.1 PROPFIND The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI, if the resource does not have any internal members, or on the resource identified by the Request-URI and potentially its member resources, if the resource is a collection that has internal member URIs.  </s>
<s> All DAV compliant resources MUST support the PROPFIND method and the propfind XML element (section 12.14) along with all XML elements defined for use with that element.  </s>
<s> A client may submit a Depth header with a value of "0", "1", or "infinity" with a PROPFIND on a collection resource with internal member URIs.  </s>
<s> DAV compliant servers MUST support the "0", "1" and "infinity" behaviors.  </s>
<s> By default, the PROPFIND method without a Depth header MUST act as if a "Depth: infinity" header was included.  </s>
<s> {the next three paragraphs are unchanged} A client may submit a propfind XML element in the body of the request method describing what information is being requested.  </s>
<s> It is possible to request particular property values, all property values, or a list of the names of the resource's properties.  </s>
<s> A client may choose not to submit a request body.  </s>
<s> An empty PROPFIND request body MUST be treated as a request for the names and values of all properties.  </s>
<s> All servers MUST support returning a response of content type text/xml or application/xml that contains a multistatus XML element that describes the results of the attempts to retrieve the various properties.  </s>
<s> If there is an error retrieving a property then a proper error result MUST be included in the response.  </s>
<s> A request to retrieve the value of a property which does not exist is an error and MUST be noted, if the response uses a multistatus XML element, with a response XML element which contains a 404 (Not Found) status value.  </s>
<s> {the next paragraph was changed} Consequently, the multistatus XML element for a collection resource with member URIs MUST include a response XML element for each member URI of the collection, to whatever depth was requested.  </s>
<s> Each response XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the URI of the resource on which the properties in the prop XML element are defined.  </s>
<s> Results for a PROPFIND on a collection resource with internal member URIs are returned as a flat list whose order of entries is not significant.  </s>
<s> {the last two paragraphs are unchanged} In the case of allprop and propname, if a principal does not have the right to know whether a particular property exists then the property should be silently excluded from the response.  </s>
<s> The results of this method SHOULD NOT be cached.  </s>
<s> 8.6 DELETE 8.6.1 DELETE for Non-Collection Resources If the DELETE method is issued to a non-collection resource whose URIs are an internal member of one or more collections, then during DELETE processing a server MUST remove any URI for the resource identified by the Request-URI from collections which contain it as a member.  </s>
<s> 8.6.2 DELETE for Collections {the following paragraph was unchanged} The DELETE method on a collection MUST act as if a "Depth: infinity" header was used on it.  </s>
<s> A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header with a DELETE on a collection with any value but infinity.  </s>
<s> DELETE instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI and all resources identified by its internal member URIs are to be deleted.  </s>
<s> If any resource identified by a member URI cannot be deleted then all of the member's ancestors MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain namespace consistency.  </s>
<s> {the following paragraph was unchanged} Any headers included with DELETE MUST be applied in processing every resource to be deleted.  </s>
<s> When the DELETE method has completed processing it MUST result in a consistent namespace.  </s>
<s> {the following paragraph was unchanged} If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status).  </s>
<s> 424 (Failed Dependency) errors SHOULD NOT be in the 207 (Multi-Status).  </s>
<s> They can be safely left out because the client will know that the ancestors of a resource could not be deleted when the client receives an error for the ancestor's progeny.  </s>
<s> Additionally 204 (No Content) errors SHOULD NOT be returned in the 207 (Multi-Status).  </s>
<s> The reason for this prohibition is that 204 (No Content) is the default success code.  </s>
<s> 8.8 COPY Method The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource, identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource, identified by the URI in the Destination header.  </s>
<s> The Destination header MUST be present.  </s>
<s> The exact behavior of the COPY method depends on the type of the source resource.  </s>
<s> {the following paragraph was unchanged} All WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the COPY method.  </s>
<s> However, support for the COPY method does not guarantee the ability to copy a resource.  </s>
<s> For example, separate programs may control resources on the same server.  </s>
<s> As a result, it may not be possible to copy a resource to a location that appears to be on the same server.  </s>
<s> 8.8.3 COPY for Collections {the following paragraph was unchanged} The COPY method on a collection without a Depth header MUST act as if a Depth header with value "infinity" was included.  </s>
<s> A client may submit a Depth header on a COPY on a collection with a value of "0" or "infinity".  </s>
<s> DAV compliant servers MUST support the "0" and "infinity" Depth header behaviors.  </s>
<s> A COPY of depth infinity instructs that the collection resource identified by the Request-URI is to be copied to the location identified by the URI in the Destination header, and all its internal member resources are to be copied to a location relative to it, recursively through all levels of the collection hierarchy.  </s>
<s> A COPY of "Depth: 0" only instructs that the collection and its properties but not resources identified by its internal member URIs, are to be copied.  </s>
<s> {the following paragraph was unchanged} Any headers included with a COPY MUST be applied in processing every resource to be copied with the exception of the Destination header.  </s>
<s> The Destination header only specifies the destination URI for the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> When applied to members of the collection identified by the Request-URI the value of Destination is to be modified to reflect the current location in the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> So, if the Request-URI is /a/ with Host header value http://fun.com/ and the Destination is http://fun.com/b/ then when http://fun.com/a/c/d is processed it must use a Destination of When the COPY method has completed processing it MUST have created a consistent namespace at the destination (see section 5.1 for the definition of namespace consistency).  </s>
<s> However, if an error occurs while copying an internal collection, the server MUST NOT copy any resources identified by members of this collection (i.e., the server must skip this subtree), as this would create an inconsistent namespace.  </s>
<s> After detecting an error, the COPY operation SHOULD try to finish as much of the original copy operation as possible (i.e., the server should still attempt to copy other subtrees and their members, that are not descendents of an error-causing collection).  </s>
<s> So, for example, if an infinite depth copy operation is performed on collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an error occurs copying /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to copy /a/c/.  </s>
<s> Similarly, after encountering an error copying a non-collection resource as part of an infinite depth copy, the server SHOULD try to finish as much of the original copy operation as possible.  </s>
<s> {the following 2 paragraphs are unchanged} If an error in executing the COPY method occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status).  </s>
<s> The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code SHOULD NOT be returned in the 207 (Multi-Status) response from a COPY method.  </s>
<s> These responses can be safely omitted because the client will know that the progeny of a resource could not be copied when the client receives an error for the parent.  </s>
<s> Additionally 201 (Created)/204 (No Content) status codes SHOULD NOT be returned as values in 207 (Multi-Status) responses from COPY methods.  </s>
<s> They, too, can be safely omitted because they are the default success codes.  </s>
<s> 8.9 MOVE Method The MOVE operation on a non-collection resource is the logical equivalent of a copy (COPY), followed by consistency maintenance processing, followed by a delete of the source, where all three actions are performed atomically.  </s>
<s> The consistency maintenance step allows the server to perform updates caused by the move, such as updating all URIs other than the Request-URI which identify the source resource, to point to the new destination resource.  </s>
<s> Consequently, the Destination header MUST be present on all MOVE methods and MUST follow all COPY requirements for the COPY part of the MOVE method.  </s>
<s> All DAV compliant resources MUST support the MOVE method.  </s>
<s> However, support for the MOVE method does not guarantee the ability to move a resource to a particular destination.  </s>
<s> {the final two paragraphs are unchanged} For example, separate programs may actually control different sets of resources on the same server.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it may not be possible to move a resource within a namespace that appears to belong to the same server.  </s>
<s> If a resource exists at the destination, the destination resource will be DELETEd as a side-effect of the MOVE operation, subject to the restrictions of the Overwrite header.  </s>
<s> 8.9.2 MOVE for Collections A MOVE with "Depth: infinity" instructs that the collection identified by the Request-URI be moved to the URI specified in the Destination header, and all resources identified by its internal member URIs are to be moved to locations relative to it, recursively through all levels of the collection hierarchy.  </s>
<s> {the following three paragraphs are unchanged} The MOVE method on a collection MUST act as if a "Depth: infinity" header was used on it.  </s>
<s> A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header on a MOVE on a collection with any value but "infinity".  </s>
<s> Any headers included with MOVE MUST be applied in processing every resource to be moved with the exception of the Destination header.  </s>
<s> The behavior of the Destination header is the same as given for COPY on collections.  </s>
<s> When the MOVE method has completed processing it MUST have created a consistent namespace at both the source and destination (see section 5.1 for the definition of namespace consistency).  </s>
<s> However, if an error occurs while moving an internal collection, the server MUST NOT move any resources identified by members of the failed collection (i.e., the server must skip the error-causing subtree), as this would create an inconsistent namespace.  </s>
<s> In this case, after detecting the error, the move operation SHOULD try to finish as much of the original move as possible (i.e., the server should still attempt to move other subtrees and the resources identified by their members, that are not descendents of an error-causing collection).  </s>
<s> So, for example, if an infinite depth move is performed on collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an error occurs moving /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to try moving /a/c/.  </s>
<s> Similarly, after encountering an error moving a non-collection resource as part of an infinite depth move, the server SHOULD try to finish as much of the original move operation as possible.  </s>
<s> {the following two paragraphs are unchanged} If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status).  </s>
<s> The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code SHOULD NOT be returned in the 207 (Multi-Status) response from a MOVE method.  </s>
<s> These errors can be safely omitted because the client will know that the progeny of a resource could not be moved when the client receives an error for the parent.  </s>
<s> Additionally 201 (Created)/204 (No Content) responses SHOULD NOT be returned as values in 207 (Multi-Status) responses from a MOVE.  </s>
<s> These responses can be safely omitted because they are the default success codes.  </s>
<s> 9.3 Destination Header Destination = "Destination" ":" absoluteURI The Destination header specifies the URI which identifies a destination resource for methods such as COPY and MOVE, which take two URIs as parameters.  </s>
<s> Note that the absoluteURI production is defined in [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> 12.13.2 set XML element Name:set Namespace:DAV: Purpose:Lists the DAV property values to be set for a resource.  </s>
<s> Description: The set XML element MUST contain only a prop XML element.  </s>
<s> The elements contained by the prop XML element inside the set XML element MUST specify the name and value of properties that are set on the resource identified by Request-URI.  </s>
<s> If a property already exists then its value is replaced.  </s>
<s> Language tagging information in the property's value (in the "xml:lang" attribute, if present) MUST be persistently stored along with the property, and MUST be subsequently retrievable using PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> That's it! - Jim  </s>
<s> This thread/discussion has been great.  </s>
<s> My hat is off to JimW for starting it.  </s>
<s> It appears to have died down now or moved off-line.  </s>
<s> It's unclear to  </s>
<s> me if we've come to an agreement or not.  </s>
<s> Jim, perhaps you could update (the wording of) your initial proposal based on some of the comments... or just sumarize the comments that followed and let everyone say if they agree or not.  </s>
<s> There's been a lot of import stuff discussed here and I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason.  </s>
<s> Aw, shucks.  </s>
<s> But, really, Larry Masinter deserves all the credit for raising consciousness on this issue, and for motivating this thread.  </s>
<s> Let me first summarize points on which I believe the list has come to agreement: 1) A collection can have more than one URI.  </s>
<s> Larry Masinter raised this point in: 2) The member URIs of a collection will "change" depending on the URI used to access the collection.  </s>
<s> This was brought up by me in: And also by Yaron Goland in: Jim Davis I believe agrees in: Larry Masinter then noted that the definition of internal member URIs in the specification doesn't match this shared understanding, and should be changed.  </s>
<s> This implies some spec.  </s>
<s> changes to me: - the definition of collection and internal member URI requires some tweaking - the specification should explicitly note that collections might be accessible via more than one URI - when a new resource is created, the Request-URI of the creation method is only added to a single collection resource (after tweaking to make it a relative URI), but if this collection resource is accessible via multiple URLs, then the newly created resource also MUST (SHOULD?) be available via multiple URLs (so it is available via the multiple names of the collection).  </s>
<s> 3) Folding the URL space for case insensitive servers (may not have agreement on this point -- let's see).  </s>
<s> Larry Masinter raised this point in: Jim Davis also discussed it in: Some servers may have case insensitive namespaces, in essence creating 2^n URIs by which a resource can be accessed (where n is the number of non-slash characters after the hostname in a URL).  </s>
<s> In this case a server should only display one of the 2^n URIs for each resource in a PROPFIND result, and should accept any of the 2^n URIs as the Request-URI for a method.  </s>
<s> The collection resource contains all 2^n URIs (but will never display all 2^n URIs, nor should a reasonable implementation actually explicitly store all 2^n URIs).  </s>
<s> When creating a new resource, the server will add all 2^n URIs to its parent collection resource.  </s>
<s> Essentially, the server is using its special knowledge about the namespace to behave more intelligently.  </s>
<s> For servers which are not case sensitive, the server cannot behave more intelligently, and hence the server will behave as if any of the 2^n case variants of a URI are the URI for a different resource.  </s>
<s> Such a server can contain any of the set of 2^n case variants of a URI in a collection, and will list all of these URIs on a PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> This raises the question of whether a client needs to be able to discover whether a collection is case insensitive.  </s>
<s> 4) Cannonicalization of the base URI for a collection Larry Masinter, in: Raises the point that if you're performing relative URI operations, you need to have a cannonical form of the base part of the URI.  </s>
<s> This probably will look like a restatement of the equality rules for HTTP URLs given in section 3.2.3 of RFC 2068.  </s>
<s> 5) Clean up use of URI/URL Larry Masinter, in: Highlights that the use of URI and URL is inconsistent in the DAV spec., and gives an alternate definition of URI/URL for use in the spec.  </s>
<s> It seems prudent to review all uses of these terms to ensure they're being used consistently, and use the new definition for URI/URL.  </s>
<s> Areas of disagreement: 1) Unknown disagreement: Larry Masinter wrote in:  </s>
<s> I don't understand why there's a constraint here at all, but if there is one, and clients rely on it, then let's make sureit's clear.  </s>
<s> Roy Fielding agreed:  </s>
<s> I'll agree with Larry here -- I've been staying out of the debate largely because I don't understand the need for the requirement at all.  </s>
<s> The only problem is that I don't understand what constraint they're talking about!  </s>
<s> Is this a discussion of case sensitivity, or namespace consistency?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if I have missed any points, or incorrectly summarized an issue.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I'll agree with Larry here -- I've been staying out of the debate largely because I don't understand the need for the requirement at all.  </s>
<s> My comment was regarding the requirement that DAV capable resources be within a DAV collection.  </s>
<s> There is no need for that requirement and it is the root of many terminology issues.  </s>
<s> Any individual resource is capable of being or not being DAVable, as determined by either the capabilities described by an OPTIONS response or by the error response received when attempting to do a WebDAV operation on a non-DAV resource.  </s>
<s> "Save as..." dialogs are cool, but not necessary, for authoring.  </s>
<s> Eliminating the unnecessary requirement also removes any need to talk about how many different URI reference the same resource, or what  </s>
<s> might be the canonical preferred URI for a given resource.  </s>
<s> It just doesn't matter if the definition is based on the request semantics instead of a paricular idealized model of the URI namespace.  </s>
<s> Instead, just define what a collection contains (its own namespace) and how to get a representation of that collection.  </s>
<s> This was also the meat of the primary (aside from locking) objection raised in Mark Anderson's critique of section 5 within http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0099.html .  </s>
<s> In fact, I'd recommend replacing much of the existing section 5 with the text he articulated, or at least merge it in so that it is clear what motivates the discussion and explain why the "source resource" reference is actually the most significant bit that DAV adds to HTTP.  </s>
<s> Because it is, and I'm getting a tired of explaining what a server is supposed to do when a client tries to PUT to a derived resource.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> The primary rational for this requirement is to avoid some of the weird edge cases which can occur when some URLs in an HTTP URL namespace are members of a collection, and some are not.  </s>
<s> For example, assume there are four resources, R1, R2, R3, and R4.  </s>
<s> They are accessible via 4 URLs, as follows: Let us assume this is a non-consistent namespace, where collection resource R1 contains only the following two relative URLs: ./index.html ./logo.gif Importantly, collection resource R1 *does not* contain: ./other.html  </s>
<s> This is what makes the namespace inconsistent.  </s>
<s> Following the definition of DELETE, if a DELETE of Depth: infinity is performed on http://www.example.org/collection/,  </s>
<s> resources R1, R2, and R3 will be deleted, but R4 will not.  </s>
<s> That is, after a successful delete on representation of R4.  </s>
<s> This was viewed as undesirable behavior, and led directly to the requirement for consistent namespaces for DAV-compliant resources.  </s>
<s> In particular, this case creates odd cases for server implementors who use a hierarchically structured repository, like a file system.  </s>
<s> In the example above, if the resources correspond to the following files: R1 - /home/ejw/public_html/collection/ R2 - /home/ejw/public_html/collection/index.html R3 - /home/ejw/public_html/collection/logo.gif R4 - /home/ejw/public_html/collection/other.html  </s>
<s> After the DELETE, the server will need to keep file /home/ejw/public_html/collection/ around, but non-accessible (i.e., removing the mapping of http://www.example.org/collection/  </s>
<s> to this resource, but not destroying the underlying chunk of state the resource was mapped to), in order to ensure there is a container for /home/ejw/public_html/collection/other.html  </s>
<s> Alternately, the server could decide to delete /home/ejw/public_html/collection/other.html so it can also delete /home/ejw/public_html/collection/ (i.e., if the server treats the request to delete the collection as being more important than preserving resources which aren't a member of the collection).  </s>
<s> So, to avoid these strange edge cases, and to avoid possible interoperability problems they might cause, the Design Team felt it was simpler to require consistency of the HTTP URL namespace for WeBDAV-compliant resources than to place the burden on servers to implement these edge cases correctly.  </s>
<s> But, what I am hearing from some members of the working group is that they would prefer to drop this requirement.  </s>
<s> In the end, this had already boiled down to an editorial note that a resource can have more than one URI.  </s>
<s> The major change was dealing with the URI vs. resource distinction.  </s>
<s> What is your suggestion for how to do this in a precise way?  </s>
<s> This is what we were aiming for in our definition of namespace consistency.  </s>
