<s> Am I the only user of amaya7.2 (GTK version) *and* emacs under linux experiencing that activating amaya's exit keyboard shortcut ^X-^C does not only influence an amaya window but is 'inherited' (with a definitely unwanted effect) by an emacs job running under the same X server?  </s>
<s> I don't remember to have encountered that 'behaviour' with prior amaya versions.  </s>
<s> I'm running Redhat7.3 and have configured my Gnome window manager to focus a window by mouse pointer.  </s>

<s> I do use both and never had this problem... What is your window manager ?  </s>
<s> Until we can reproduce the bug, you should add this to your .emacs : ;; ...never quit by mistake... (global-set-key [(control x) (control c)] (function (lambda () (interactive) (cond ((y-or-n-p "Quit editor?  </s>
<s> ") (save-buffers-kill-emacs))))))  </s>
<s> I encounter ^X-^C quitting both amaya and emacs even after having added the above elisp snippet to my ~/.emacs!  </s>
<s> However I can't see any pattern in when it happens and when it doesn't.  </s>
<s> And I encounter that very behaviour on 2 different linux boxes both of them set up with Redhat 7.3 and both of them using the sawfish window manager.  </s>
