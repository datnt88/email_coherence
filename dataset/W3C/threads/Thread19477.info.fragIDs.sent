Say I have an anchor as part of a heading. 
I then want to make a hyperlink to that anchor in the document. 
When I do so, Amaya does not seem to properly identify the target indicated with the mouse, and instead gives me a dialog box to enter the link URL into. 
This is 1.3b, Windows 98.

In previous versions of Amaya, anchors with a name (potential targets for links) were displayed in green. 
This has been changed, because it was ambiguous (style sheets or FONT elements can also change the color to green) and it did not work with IDs attributes attached to large elements such as DIVs. 
In version 1.3, every potential target of a link is represented by a target icon (even large elements with an ID attribute), but to avoid disturbing page layout with this icons when you are just browsing, you have to ask for the target icons to be displayed. 
Use the Views menu to do that: there is an item "show targets". 
When targets are shown, you just have to click a target icon to set a link. 
The dialog box for entering URLs is shown only when you don't click a target icon. 
I hope it helps, Vincent.

We plan to accept to click on the text within an named anchor in next release. 
So the user won't need to display targets or to open the links view to make an hyperlink to anchors in the document. 
To create an hyperlink to an element with ID, the situation won't change.
