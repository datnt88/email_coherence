<s> I finally managed to comb through all of my archived mail and massage it into an issues list for proposed changes to RFC 2396:  </s>
<s> Sorry, no HTML format yet.  </s>
<s> I bet that someone else could produce a DTD and XSLT faster than I can, so contributions are welcome.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Here's a lo-tech contribution; it doesn't provide much in the way of hypertext navigation, but it allows me to read the file (in galeon's normal view) at least as well as in view-source mode.  </s>
<s> Add one line to the .xml  </s>
<s> : and put these few lines in issue-style.css:  </s>
<s> --8 --  </s>
<s> issue, report { display: block; } issue { border:2px solid black; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em } pre { display: block; white-space: pre } name { font-weight: bold; vertical-align: super } title { font-size: larger; font-weight: bold } --8 -- Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I realized there can be multiple reports under one issue, so this works a bit better: --8 -- issue, report { display: block; } issue { padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em } report { border:2px solid black; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em } pre { display: block; white-space: pre } name { font-weight: bold; vertical-align: super } title { font-size: larger; font-weight: bold } action { display: block; } --8 -- Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Julian provided a basic XSLT, to which I added some bits and made in order to generate ....Roy  </s>
