Thanks for your comments on the RDF semantics document. 
I will adopt your editorial suggestions, correct typos, and will try to remove uses of terminology with any potential philosophical penumbra from the technical prose in the document. 
I have one clarification question concerning your comment on datatypes: 3.2. 
Types as lexical mappings (schema-related) A datatype is an entity characterized by a set of character strings called lexical forms and a mapping from that set to a set of values. 
We have a couple of reservations concerning this characterization. 
* The statement describes (with the exception of the problem just noted) simple datatypes, but not the class of complex datatypes which can be defined by XML Schema, nor all the types (or type-like constructs) definable in various other schema languages for XML. 
I have followed other authors in this characterization, and am somewhat surprised to discover that it is incomplete or inadequate. 
Can you suggest, or point me to a source for, a definition which does cover the more general case, or which clarifies what is wrong with this characterization? 
We are supposed to have a datatyping framework which can handle all the built-in XML Schema datatypes. 
Thanks for any help you can give.

I'm going to start wearing a toga to RDF Core teleconferences (with a side order of hemlock just in case) Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Members of the Schema WG have pointed out that the spec actually doesn't use 'datatype' as a term for complex types, so the comment we sent you is not quite right. 
Some members of the WG, including the individual who actually drafted that comment, think of the term 'datatype' as denoting a class with two major subclasses, the simple and the complex (data)types; on that interpretation, the description in the RDF semantics document describes only the simple types, but not all datatypes. 
The XML Schema spec, it would appear, may well stop short -- and almost certainly does, though I have not checked this question in preparing this reply -- of committing the WG or the reader to that as an official view. 
If one does not think that the superclass common to complex types and simple types is usefully called 'datatype', then (a) one has some good company in some members of the XML Schema WG, and (b) the description in RDF Semantics would appear to be unobjectionable. 
At the moment, I'm speaking only for myself; I will put the question to the WG in a future meeting and ask for a clarification, revision, or retraction of the comment in question. 
Thank you for your request for clarification; it promises to be enlightening for a larger number of us than might at first have been suspected.

M. Sperberg-McQueen Thank you for your note. 
You are quite right: the term 'datatype' is used in our spec, as in yours, solely in a sense extensionally equivalent to 'simple type'. 
The WG member who drafted our comments has what turned out to be an isolated minority view of the desirable usage, and the comment slipped by when the WG reviewed the draft comments without anyone noticing the problem. 
The WG has discussed the issue and confirmed that we do not wish to treat 'datatype' as a synonym for 'type' or as covering both simple types and complex types. 
So we withdraw the comment, with thanks to you for drawing the problem to our attention.

M. Sperberg-McQueen on behalf of the XML Schema Working Group Thanks for your response, and to the WG for the effort which produced it. 
BTW, the text of the relevant section has been rewritten in response to other comments. 
(See In particular, the 'parameter' D of D-interpretations is now considered to be a functional mapping from URIrefs to datatypes, rather than a set of datatypes. 
This is in order to have a clear statement of the way that a D-interpretation treats datatypes as having 'names' without committing to the 'name' being in any sense a component or part of the datatype itself, an issue which arose rather acutely in OWL. 
I have used the term 'datatype map' for this mapping, and although this is not intended to be normative, and is not currently used outside the RDF semantics document, I would welcome your opinion of whether this term is likely to produce any confusion with any terminology in your forthcoming drafts. 
The shorter word 'map' was chosen deliberately in order to be more distinctive, but it would be easy to change this terminology at this stage. 
I would prefer to sacrifice elegance to lack of ambiguity rather than the other way around, however. 
Pat Hayes PS. 
We are still discussing your suggestion about 'lexical mapping'. 
The text currently uses the longer term 'lexical-to-value mapping' in the interests of being thoroughly unambiguous, but this may be changed.
