<s> It is wonderful to see some real user-centred research going on in this area.  </s>
<s> I'm sure many of us have are concerned about the lack of solid user research to help apply WCAG guidelines in the most usable way.  </s>

<s> "Skip to content (happy)" has always been an annoyance, along with "hommaparj" (so I always avoid writing it as one word).  </s>

<s> -Steve  </s>
<s> I'm going to weigh in here about the study as a whole.  </s>
<s> We don't know anything about their samples and we don't know what sites and versions of jaws and windows and ie were used and I for one am disturbed at the findings as they don't seem to shed any real lite on the issues.  </s>
<s> The cognitive difficulties that dominate this age group are not really tied to literacy.  </s>
<s> My impression is that they would find the Peepo approach demeaning, and it would force them to learn a *new* language.  </s>
<s> There are two basic types of problem: - loss of short term memory, which makes it almost impossible to learn anything new, even on a temporary basis; this affects a significant number, but not the majority; - for the majority, a combination of the following: * a fear of making mistakes (children will play with user interfaces, but seniors will not) - this also probably underlies the "can't program the video recorder" syndrome; * the need to catch up on at least a decade of knowledge on how user interfaces work and the design conventions used by web sites (current GUI interfaces are *NOT* simple to learn from cold); * a reduction in the speed of learning, combined with with a greater perception of what has to be learned results in de-motivation, aids, like check lists, to get you started until you have memorised the rules, only work if you can reduce the whole web to a set of rules that fit on one side of paper - certainly possible if authors didn't suppress standard user interface behaviour and conventions; * dexterity problems in getting good hand eye coordination with a mouse and problems getting a good focus on a screen whose optimum distance is half way between reading and distance vision.  </s>
<s> Language level does have an impact, of course, as: - there is a specific vocabulary associated with user interfaces; even "click" is actually a technical term; and a shopping basket icon is also a technical term, in an ideographic language, and particular subject to artistic interpretation; - a lot of material is aimed at the, assumed to be affluent, 18 to 24 age group and may use their slang, and their cultural references - which are in part intended, by that clique of users, to exclude their parents and grand-parents' generations - web site authors don't want to be seen as part of such excluded generations; - material aimed at businesses is normally written in the marketing speak of "solutions", "leverage", "downsizing", etc., which, I guess, is also about appearing to be in the clique (personally I find it to often say nothing at all, but use a lot of long words to do so - actually, I suspect it is because the people who have to summarise to senior management don't have anything solid to say, either); - some academic material may be in jargon, but that can be a positive sign, as it can mean that the people who really know what they are talking about are writing the pages - the commercial tendency is to dumb down pages to the point of distorting the content [Note 1], or to pick on some detail that is long established for the engineers and stress that instead of the true innovation [Note 2].  </s>
<s> Often the choice, at that level, is between having the jargon or not having the information on the web at all.  </s>
<s> In general, web sites are advertisements, and the modern (well 20th century) advertising industry is about not communicating facts, but about influencing emotions, so anyone expecting to find clearly understandable, real, information, on a commercial web site, has unreasonable expectations, even though that is exactly the purpose behind the original web.  </s>
<s> (My feeling is that sites (typically governmental) with a mission to inform are corrupted by staff who want to get into the more lucrative commercial web site market and by using companies who developed for the commercial market, as external contractors, rather than developing pages internally).  </s>
<s> [Note 3])  </s>
<s> That's because they are trying to identify with the 18-24 market and because they cannot distinguish their product from the competition on the basis of facts, so must push stress branding and create emotional associations.  </s>
<s> This is the key problem with all pages that attempt to create their own user interface conventions (most commercial pages).  </s>
<s> I don't believe it would be particularly difficult to write a one a two page operating guide describing how to use basic form controls and links, but there is no point in doing so, as there aren't enough useful sites around to even allow one to use it to practice with the abstract user interface elements, before learning that things that really look like links can be abstract buttons, and that many links look like ordinary text.  </s>
<s> cynical They do that because the other tactic, namely to put them in low constrast, small print, right at the bottom of the screen, that they use for other legal (or search engine based) requirements (copyright notices, fallbacks for non-scripting browsers, etc.) won't work for something that has to be early in the reading order.  </s>
<s> Page designers really don't want those elements at all.  </s>
<s> /cynical  </s>
<s> Personally, I always find that flashyness is an indication of a lack of real content.  </s>
<s> Where there is real content and a low graphics page, I generally find the low graphics page much easier to navigate.  </s>
<s> You basically have to accept that web page design is a branch of commerical visual arts, not of technical writing or computing.  </s>
<s> Web pages belong to the advertising budget and big web site design firms are the new advertising agencies.  </s>
<s> A few years ago, I commented on the lack of simplicity in one web site nominally associated with a WW II ex-servicemen's association for one particular (less well known) theatre of war.  </s>
<s> To be fair, this site is being run on voluntary basis (although with advertising revenue, but for cost recovery, not the primary reason for runninig the site) by someone not actually employed by the charity.  </s>
<s> However, their response was that they didn't expect the site to be used by the veterans themselves but by their grand-children, and possibly children.  </s>
<s> [Note 1] Even before the web, my experience was that computer documentation written by technical authors, might use simple words, but it almost always missed the point on technical issues.  </s>
<s> [Note 2] Some years ago, electronic watches were marketed as the "magic of quartz", when the real innovation (and even then more of a logical conclusion of long line of development) was electronics small enough and low power enough for the application.  </s>
<s> Using the piezo electric effect in quartz as part of a frequency standard was common place in WW II and must have been known about for much longer.  </s>
<s> [Note 3] I suspect one factor in the use of external web site designers by governmental bodies is they are under political pressure to have the new communications technology reach as large an audience as possible, but it is too difficult to write simple, but internally consistent (and acceptable to the lawyers), summaries of legislation and work done, so they resort to the commercial tactic of hiding incomplete information behind a flashy exterior.  </s>
