<s> any takers?  </s>
<s> More pertinent to this virus, should the Unicode Consortium issue a statement or have a web page pointing out that Unicode does not need to be put in a binary attachment, when mailed?  </s>
<s> A short explanation would be helfpul to people with respect to recognizing the virus.  </s>
<s> It would be educational for the techies that could know more about Unicode then they do.  </s>
<s> It would help suppress the creation of myths around e-mailing Unicode.  </s>
<s> I think some mags would pick it up.  </s>
<s> And it would be nice if the end of the short faq said, and you can learn more at the next Unicode Conference.  </s>
<s> It would be, dare I say, viral marketing!  </s>
<s> ;-) The short paragraph or two could also link off to a faq on how to set your mailer to use unicode, for the most common mailers, and the benefits thereof.  </s>
<s> Probably a web page on the virus and denying its premise would get lots of hits and attention as people scurry around to learn how to remove it... tex Tex Texin cell: +1 781 789 1898 mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com Xen Master http://www.i18nGuy.com  </s>

<s> Well, yes, except that we are about the Web, and there are no email viruses in Web pages (as far as I know, touch wood), and there are no 7-bit limitations for Web pages.  </s>

<s> (I changed the subject) html is often sent by mail.  </s>
<s> Misinformation about unicode is harmful to people considering unicode for their web pages and undermines our credibility, since we are proponents of using unicode everywhere on the web.  </s>
<s> I wasn't trying to address viruses, just the misinformation that it spread.  </s>
<s> However, that said, web pages certainly carry related security risks, if not viruses.  </s>
<s> Weren't there concerns with anchors being used to run exes?  </s>
<s> maybe also pngs being executable.  </s>
<s> (Hard to remember if those were myths or true, which I guess underscores my point!  </s>

<s> Although, one might think the reason unicode was in a binary was due to a 7-bit limitation of mail, most people would think the limitation was that mail wasn't capable of transmitting 16-bit unicode.  </s>
<s> The interpretations of the message I am concerned with, should be through the eyes of a non-expert.  </s>
<s> The experts dismissed the mail as probably false, quickly.  </s>
<s> It seems providing more understanding about unicode (not viruses or email) is something geo covers.  </s>
<s> But it is just a suggestion so if there are no takers, its ok. tex  </s>

<s> Yes, that was an issue a year or two ago.  </s>
<s> It would have made a good FAQ, because it's indeed Web-related.  </s>
<s> It's probably a bit too late now.  </s>
<s> It is true that mail can't transmit 16-bit unicode.  </s>
<s> But the spam in some cases explicitly menioned UTF-8, and in others 7-bit.  </s>
<s> And that is indeed an issue, although the solution to it is content transfer encoding rather than zip.  </s>
<s> Yes. But we should cover things that are really related to the Web, not just everything related to Unicode.  </s>
