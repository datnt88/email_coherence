<s> For instance, many of the arguments on the list made me read some of the latest research on perception, attention etc. and also refresh my memory on some old stuff again and I still feel I need more.  </s>
<s> I like it when people explain both their opinions/hypothesis and also try to see what kinds of research questions there might be that they feel needs to be checked.  </s>
<s> I wonder if it would help the discussions to mark the issues that possibly need additional research in a more detailed way and gather them to a list as research problems.  </s>
<s> Then as part of the research &amp; development efforts we could try to increase our knowledge by finding experts beyond the participants of this group to come and talk about their research fields and  </s>

<s> They might find good research questions to study and we might learn more.  </s>

<s> Everyone, We have now had several such warnings/requests recently about not calling people names or characterizing their postings.  </s>
<s> Can we have this be the last warning on this.  </s>
<s> We are driving people away.  </s>
<s> If you have a position or thought please post it.  </s>
<s> If you disagree with a posting, post a counterview or alternate.  </s>
<s> You can quote what was said in your counter point -- but you don't need to talk about people or even include their name actually.  </s>
<s> This also includes referring to people as "groups" or "those people".  </s>
<s> Let's see if we can stick to ideas... and debating ideas and not people or groups.  </s>

<s> As we've more or less agreed that the spectrum includes 5-30% of the population, this may skew the results somewhat, and quite possibly towards text.  </s>
