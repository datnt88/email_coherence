<s> Hi there, I reread the LS entire spec once more and here are some comments (per section).  </s>
<s> My apologies if it addresses things that have already come up before.  </s>
<s> With the exception of the Exception rant at the end (of which I sincerely hope it makes any sense....), it are all minor typo variety kinds of remarks.  </s>
<s> 1.1 - "with the Loading and Saving *of* XML" - "Provides the ability to examine and optionally remove nodes as they are being processed while serializing DOM nodes" - Implies to me: changes the DOM while serializing  </s>
<s> 1.2.3+4 - "and therefore *h*as no recommended meaning in ECMAScript" 1.3 DOMIMplementationsLS  </s>
<s> - "on the new*ly* created LSParser/LSSerializer" (not sure, not a native English speaker) LSParser  </s>
<s> - "depenedent"  </s>
<s> - http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS (not 2003?)  </s>
<s> - "encoutered"  </s>
<s> - "In addition to the parameters recognized in [DOM Level 3 Core link]" - still 4 clicks to reach actual link through HTML spec, at least in javadocs just one.  </s>
<s> LSInput - "will only attempt to fetch the resource identified by the URI reference *only*"  </s>
<s> - What error should I throw if application tries to use LSInput without anything specified, implementation specific?  </s>
<s> Later I saw that LSSerializer has no-output-specified error  </s>
<s> - "If the system identifier is a URI, the LSParser must resolve it fully before calling this method." - What does this mean exactly, is there an example?  </s>
<s> Relative URIs like 'bla/bla.dtd' are passed as is, right?  </s>
<s> - "The namespace of the resource being resolved, *i.e.* the namespace of the XML Schema" - e.g. instead, because other non-W3C resources may have namespace URIs too?  </s>
<s> - systemId is not mentioned as can be null (unlike other params).  </s>
<s> Now I am  </s>
<s> totally out of my element here, but can LS be used for loading HTML DOMs?  </s>
<s> And if so, so HTML not allow only public id in DOCTYPE?  </s>
<s> If systemId is obligatory, then maybe nice to make that explicit.  </s>
<s> - "A*n* LSInput" (?) (multiple times in doc)  </s>
<s> LSParserFilter - Do I read it correctly that the children of entity reference nodes can be skipped or rejected, so I can get content of entity references that does not match the DTD in the result DOM? (just checking, no problem for us)  </s>
<s> LSSerializer - "The XML data is written to a string or an output stream." - Or to other stuff like a webserver?  </s>
<s> - "EntityReference nodes are serialized as an entity reference of the form "&amp;entityName;" in the output.  </s>
<s> Child nodes (the expansion) of the entity reference are ignored." - Unless 'entities' parameter is set to false, right?  </s>
<s> If not, I really want to be able to get rid of entity references during serialization without touching the DOM.  </s>
<s> - "The character normalization process affects only the data as it is being written; it does not alter the DOM's view of the document after serialization has completed."  </s>
<s> - Does this not simply apply to everything related to serialization?  </s>
<s> (if so, useful to mention in intro) Same for namespace fixup.  </s>
<s> Now that I see there is an issue there, we prefer that serialization never changes DOM (note: we do not implement validation during serialization, perhaps that makes it very hard?).  </s>
<s> - "Report a*n* fatal error"  </s>
<s> - "The parameters "well-formed", "namespaces", and "namespace-declarations" cannot be set to false" - These seem to give a fair bit of overhead (lot more checks), I'd rather see that they default to true for LSSerializer, and leave setting them to false up to the implementation.  </s>
<s> (Especially like this would be exactly the kind of thing someone would write a conformance test for... ;-)  </s>
<s> LSOutput - "This attribute (encoding) has no effect when outputting to a character stream." - nitpick, well it does for the XML declaration written out and for splitting CDATA sections I suppose?  </s>
<s> What happens if as a user I do not bother to set an error handler, and IOExceptions occur.  </s>
<s> Maybe a core issue but they don't have that many IOException (or other serious caught Exceptions that can seemingly dissappear into thin air) opportunities like LS has.  </s>
<s> The more I think about it the stranger I think it is a Load/ Save spec defines so little in the way of error handling.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> So what happens in case of an IOException, it's wrapped in a DOMError (where the exception is an object in the Java binding...) and gets passed to the error handler but that thing can't even rethrow it (because no throws is defined for handleError, and IOException is a caught exception).So far we cheated in our implementation (still had DOMSystemException, I figured the error handling stuff would be changed), and threw the original exception when no error-handler was set.  </s>
<s> Again I may be missing something but the way I interpret the spec now if I do Document willThisBeNull = implementation.createLSParser(....).parseURI("file:///c:/does_not_exist.xml"  </s>
<s> I get no exception?  </s>
<s> DOMError on core says "A SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR will cause the normal processing to stop and the return value of DOMErrorHandler.handleError() is ignored".  </s>
<s> Okay, so we stop processing, but what does that mean?  </s>
<s> Not a DOMException I suppose?  </s>
<s> Kind regards, --Sander.  </s>
<s> s/remove/filter/  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> It's already in the implementations now.  </s>
<s> No reason to change this, so no change.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> I added a direct link to DOMConfiguration.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Correct. Added no-input-specified error.  </s>
<s> The sentence was removed from the LSResourceResolver description.  </s>
<s> s/.../e.g. the target namespace of the XML Schema/.  </s>
<s> The "namespace of the resource" is resource dependent and should be used a parameter of the resource being resolved.  </s>
<s> Changed. now it does.  </s>
<s> I can be used to load XHTML documents, but we never intended the interfaces for HTML documents.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> It was clarified as follows: method on the filter.  </s>
<s> If the parameter "entities" is set to true, the entity reference nodes are passed to the filter, but not its children.  </s>
<s> If it is set to false, the children of the entity reference are passed to the filter, but not the entity reference nodes since they are replaced by their expansions.  </s>
<s> Note that, as described by the parameter  </s>
<s> "entities", entity reference nodes to non-defined entities are always passed to the filter.  </s>
<s> Yes. the output stream could be attached to an HTTP connection.  </s>
<s> No changes were made in the specification.  </s>
<s> correct, "unless 'entities' parameter is set to false.  </s>
<s> As long as the children of the entity reference are defined, you won't get an entity reference node in the serialized content.  </s>
<s> This issue left in the specification for the attention of the implementators.  </s>
<s> We clarified that yes, the transformation done during the serilization do not affect the DOM tree, only the serialized content.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Regarding namespaces and namespaces-declarations, it has been clarified that: - namespaces can be set to false on LSSerializer.domConfig.  </s>
<s> - namespace-declarations has effect if namespaces is set to false.  </s>
<s> (since no namespace processing is done, the xmlns attributes are no longer namespace declarations).  </s>
<s> Regarding well-formed, this discussion is still on-going.  </s>
<s> The sentence was removed.  </s>
<s> It has been pointed out that this attribute can (and should) have an effect.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> I'm not sure this entirely answers Sander's query as I understood it.  </s>
<s> Certainly I'd like to know: What happens when "entities" is set to true and the LS...Filter asks for the entity reference node to be SKIPped?  </s>
<s> 1. the child nodes are processed with the filter receiving callbacks for them, as if "entities" had been set to false just for this one entity reference; 2. the entity reference's child nodes are processed en bloc, without calling the filter again at all; 3. it is taken as the equivalent of REJECTing the entity reference, so nothing is processed; 4. explicitly disallowed; 5. implementation specific.  </s>
<s> (FWIW, pxdom currently plumps for option 1.)  </s>
<s> Andrew Clover  </s>
<s> I believe it does.  </s>
<s> You will never get the children passed to the filter if entities to true.  </s>
<s> It is option 3. Since the children are not passed to the filter, skipping the entity reference is equivalent to reject it with the new wording.  </s>
<s> However, the Group did not consider case 1, so we might still want to allow it.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> We reconsidered the case, and found useful to pick option 1 (instead of the option 3 status quo).  </s>
<s> You don't have to change your implementation then.  </s>
<s> :-) Philippe  </s>
<s> After looking at that one, we decided the following changes: - introduce a LSException with 2 exception codes: PARSE_ERR, and SERIALIZE_ERR.  </s>
<s> Parser or write operations may throw an LSException if the processing is stopped.  </s>
<s> The processing can be stopped due to a DOMError with a severity of DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR or a non recovered DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR, or if DOMErrorHandler.handleError() returned false.  </s>
<s> Note: As suggested in the definition of the constants in the DOMError interface, a DOM implementation may choose to continue after a fatal error, but the resulting DOM tree is then implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> parse and write methods can throw PARSE_ERR and SERIALIZE_ERR exceptions respectively.  </s>
<s> We receiving a LSException, DOM applications should attach a DOMErrorHandler using the parameter "error-handler" if they wish to get details on the error.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
