<s> T. V. Raman:Comments On UA Guidelines Section 1 I'm a little confused by the usage of words like must in the introduction section of the document.  </s>
<s> For example, here is a specific example: Communication through standard interfaces is particularly important for graphical desktop browsers, which must make information available to assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Do you really intend must to mean need to in the above?  </s>
<s> Stylistically (and perhaps even grammatically) I'd nuke the comma and change which to that in addition to changing must to need to.  </s>
<s> I think the requirement is stronger than what you are suggesting.  </s>
<s> Graphical desktop browsers are, in fact, required by these guidelines to make information available to ATs.  </s>
<s> It's a Priority 1 requirement  </s>
<s> (checkpoints 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6), hence "must".  </s>
<s> Also, the following statement --which appears numerous times-- makes no sense to me: o Links to definitions are highlighted through the use of style sheets.  </s>
<s> The offending phrase is through the use of style sheets.  </s>
<s> The user reading the document can tell that something is highlighted --how does one know (or why should one care) that it is done through the use of stylesheets?  </s>
<s> Links to definitions are indicated graphically with green, italic text by default.  </s>
<s> The idea was to allow users to specify their own style preferences for that class of links if desired.  </s>
<s> We try to expose the use of style sheets for this purpose without going so far as to say "class="dfn-instance") Note that we also use: rel="glossary" and title="Definition of XYZ" in the link, so there's no shortage of information.  </s>
<s> Section 2 Guideline 2 Nit:word closed is repeated in: of closed closed captions (or subtitles) available (e.g., in  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Guideline 3: In 3.7, the statement Users should be able, for security reasons, to prevent scripts from executing on their machines.  </s>
<s> though factually true has nothing to do with accessibility --especially the way it is tacked on to the bit about avoiding flicker.  </s>
<s> Yes, this has been pointed out and will be cleaned up by moving the comment to the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> Guideline 4 Ensure that the user has control over the colors, text size, speech rate and pitch, and other stylistic aspects of a resource and can override author styles and user agent default styles.  </s>
<s> Sentence too long --looks like a lawyer wrote it.  </s>
<s> Worse, a tax lawyer.  </s>
<s> Just kidding.  </s>
<s> Split it into two sentences so the second half --the bit about user control-- doesn't get lost.  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> 4.2 Controlling Font Size And Style For example, allow the user to control font size through style sheets or the user interface.  </s>
<s> Phrase "or the user interface" in the sentence above makes no sense in the presence of the preceding stylesheets reference in the same sentence --especially since it is written as stylesheets or user interface.  </s>
<s> What is the intent here?  </s>
<s> If the guideline is trying to say allow the user to load a custom stylesheet --or alternatively, specify a font family and style directly through the UA's user interface-- the checkpoint should just say that in as many words.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5 This sentence looks malformed --it appears to have head nor tail.  </s>
<s> Communicate with other software (assistive technologies, the operating system, plug-ins) through applicable interfaces and observe conventions for the user interface, documentation, installation, etc.  </s>
<s> I'll add "e.g.," before "(e.g., assistive technologies, ...).  </s>
<s> And I'll break into two sentences, giving: Communicate with other software (e.g., assistive technologies, the operating system, plug-ins) through applicable interfaces.  </s>
<s> Observe conventions for the user interface, documentation, installation, etc.  </s>
<s> 5.6 User agents should export these interfaces using available operating system conventions.  </s>
<s> Note.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 1 specification states that "DOM applications may provide additional interfaces and objects not found in this specification and still be considered DOM compliant."  </s>
<s> Why should the operating system be involved in the DOM?  </s>
<s> Because the DOM doesn't specify how the interfaces it specifies are actually exported for use.  </s>
<s> For example, on a Windows platform, COM or CORBA may be the conventional ways of getting at the DOM interfaces.  </s>
<s> Also, the note that is tacked on to the sentence in question looks out of context.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the note belongs in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> The question that motivated the Note was: Is it possible to conform to the DOM while doing more than what the DOM specifies?  </s>
<s> The answer is yes.  </s>

<s> Ian requirement (checkpoints 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6),  </s>
<s> Ian --I understand that graphical desktop browsers *must* be accessible.  </s>
<s> However, in the context of the introduction section of the UA Guidelines it still comes out to me as being a bit out of place.  </s>
<s> I think the reason for this is that the "must be accessible" occurs as a subordinate clause in the sentence in question i.e. it is saying something like "do A because B" --where B== "must be accessible" --this is why it bothered me.  </s>
<s> If "must be accessible" is a priority 1 requirement, then I suggest rephrasing the sentence in question as two sentences in the following sequence B =="graphical browsers must be accessible" for achieving B do A Ian hence "must".  </s>
