Why Web Standards Matter - Carrie Bickner -- 7/15/2002 Carrie Bickner argues that employing standards can make web sites more accessible and save libraries both time and money Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- scripsit Karl Dubost: Karl, There seems to be a server problem (or maybe a standards problem? 
it's IIS/ASP) -- I'm getting a blank article at that URI. (Galeon 1.2.5 on Debian 3.0.) (getting a HEAD on that URI shows a 302 to the same URI minus the articleid param . 
. . 
that seems to be the problem) Is there another URI that actually serves the article?

agh burzum-ishi krimpatul Yes I know I had to try two times before to get the article :) Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- The printer-friendly version, no HTTP redirects. 
Jan! scripsit Jan!: Thanks, Jan. Thanasis Kinias Doctoral Student, Department of History Arizona State University Tempe, Arizona, U.S.A. Ash nazg durbatul?k,

agh burzum-ishi krimpatul scripsit Jan!: For laughs, check out the output of running the W3C validator on that document: 1. 
The article, which states The first step in creating accessible sites is to make sure that you are using well-formed XHTML. 
isn't XHTML at all; it's tag-soup MSHTML with some CSS slapped on. 
2. There's no DOCTYPE. 
3. Manually setting DOCTYPE to HTML 4.01 Transitional yields a slew of errors. 
Just how does this sort of advocacy help the cause?

agh burzum-ishi krimpatul That's often the problem when the author is not the publisher. 
The only the author can do is try to convince the people that it must be deliver as standards. 
Unfortunately, the publisher usually doesn't care or doesn't want to fix all the system for one person requesting it. 
But maybe it's another way to ask for more standard, but will work only with big voices. 
I don't come to your conference if your website is not standard. 
The other side of it is we are in an educationnal phase, and the conference organizer can say, not a problem we'll ask for someone else. 
So what's the best? 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- That's unpleasant indeed, doesn't look very serious, and I'm certain that people against any form of validation/web standards will have an easy job to laugh at the article. 
But think of it this way : the article is not published on the author's website[1] (which itself is -hum- almost valid), and it's been written to convince librarians, including the people running the library journal, that they should follow the standards. 
I respect the author's choice to publish the article on an invalid website rather than spending the same amount of time trying to convince the "library journal" only. 
Makes sense to me. 
In times of need for educational material about web standards, yes I'm disappointed to see a good article on an invalid website, but it's certainly better than no article at all, IMHO.

Cheers, olivier Olivier Thereaux - W3C I forwarded a copy of the recent analysis/validation note to Carrie with commiserations and the suggestion she send it along to the Library Journal and the company responsible for the "Powered by" logo in the left-hand margin. 
These content management systems can be a real challenge in terms of standards and accessibility. 
In addition, all parties have so much vested in the "solution" in terms of money, ego and status, that the message tends not to be one they want to hear. 
...edN Not exactly the best article about standards ever, but something is better than nothing. 
It does make some very common mistakes however... "Valid XHTML requires that every image on a web site includes descriptive text that tells the user what the image is." 
No, no, no. 
It doesn't. 
XHTML requires alt text on every image (but alt="" is totally valid, and often needed) - and alt text is *not* a description of an image, it is the meaning. 
Putting a description in every alt attribute often leads to confusing and over-verbose pages. 
"XHTML also requires that headers, lists, and other structural tags be used so readers on assistive technology are presented with a coherent document that flows logically. 
" XHTML doesn't require this either. 
This is an option you have. 
You can mark everything up with pre if you so wish, it would still be valid XHTML. 
"Furthermore, as a light version of XML, XHTML will help developers transition to full-blown XML, a richer markup language that will soon afford even greater interoperability to web sites." 
Eh?? XHTML *is* full-blown XML. 
Why do people have such a problem with understanding this? 
XML isn't going to "replace" XHTML by any means. 
"In XHTML, even "empty" tags like br and img must close themselves by including a space and a forward slash at the very end of the tag" Not very good usage of "must". 
It is a good idea to, but you don't *have* to. 
Yeh, I'm being picky. 
But I'm in a picky mood. 
So there :) Tom Gilder scripsit Tom Gilder: There seems to be some conflation of WCAG and XHTML. 
I've encounted this in my own work when I introduced valid XHTML, CSS, and WCAG compliance as part of a Web accessibility initiative. 
The whole effort had a tendency to be reduced to "CSS" or "ADA" (the Americans with Disabilities Act) in some people's vocabulary. 
True, but the difference is subtle to someone first encountering the concept of text alternatives. 
I wouldn't be overcritical there, given that it's written for a `layperson'. 
This is where I think she means WCAG, not XHTML. 
Proposed interview question for Web `designers': ``Please explain the relationship among SGML, XML, HTML, and XHTML.'' Since so few Web `experts' have any clue what SGML is, or what it has to do with HTML, it's not surprising that the XML::XHTML relationship confuses them. 
I don't understand you. 
If it's X(HT)ML, empty elements (she conflates elements and tags here, too) _must_ be closed, whether as br / or br /br . 
We prefer the former so ancient noncompliant browsers don't barf. 
But it must be one or the other, or it's not well-formed XML, much less valid XHTML.

agh burzum-ishi krimpatul Sorry, I was referring to "must include a space". 
Empty elements don't *have* to, if you aren't following the HTML backwards-compatible guidelines. 
It was an extremely picky comment though :) Tom Gilder
