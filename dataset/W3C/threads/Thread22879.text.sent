In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.3 CSS Extended Interfaces, I would suggest adding the following: "For this extension of the CSSValue interface, the valueType attribute of the underlying CSSValue interface shall be CSS_CUSTOM." under the opening description of each of the following interfaces: CSS2Azimuth CSS2BackgroundProperty CSS2BorderSpacing CSS2CounterReset CSS2CounterIncrement CSS2Cursor CSS2PlayDuring CSS2PageSize Regards, Glenn Adams :In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version :1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under :Section 5.3 CSS Extended Interfaces, I would suggest adding :the following: :"For this extension of the CSSValue interface, the valueType :attribute of the underlying CSSValue interface shall be CSS_CUSTOM." :under the opening description of each of the following interfaces: :CSS2Azimuth :CSS2BackgroundProperty :CSS2BorderSpacing :CSS2CounterReset :CSS2CounterIncrement :CSS2Cursor :CSS2PlayDuring :CSS2PageSize Maybe they should get their own type codes altogether? 
But then again they've probably been left out since they're not core compliancy interfaces. 
-Bill Bill de hOra : Cromwell Media : London bill@cromwellmedia.co.uk : +44 (0)20 8817 4039 What do you mean ? 
By suppressing the CSS_CUSTOM type and adding them into valueType space ? 
Then we will have to reserve somes codes for CSS3, SVG ... I don't think it's a good idea to go in this direction for the CSS properties. 
Philippe. 
I also agree it isn't a good idea to specify these as additional valueTypes. 
My original comment was just to add clarifying language that when these interfaces are used that the CSSValue base instance should use CSS_CUSTOM.

I'm not sure why I decided yesterday that properties should be values :) :I don't think it's a good idea to go in this direction for the :CSS properties. 
But this wouldn't be an issue if we had first a class property object to extend from in the CSSOM. 
These things aren't values anyway, they are things that are assigned values (properties), and more will need to be added in future CSSOM's, as you point out. 
I don't understand why they should hang off CSSValue.
