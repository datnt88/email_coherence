<s> Issue [Equivalence]: There are four RDF model "flavours" (formal/data model, graph(ical) model, serialization syntax, triple).  </s>
<s> To what extend (precisely) are these models (not) equivalent?  </s>
<s> (Problems related to anonymity have been discussed, see also below, details need to be summarized).  </s>
<s> Could trying to find transformation grammars be a solution (preciseness, determination of equivalence)?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't this be in a "formal" part of M&amp;S spec?  </s>
<s> Propose that o The WG believes that: - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph  </s>
<s> - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model  </s>
<s> and Syntax document are all equivalent.  </s>
<s> o The WG notes that the RDF/XML syntax as currently defined is unable to represent an arbritary RDF graph.  </s>
<s> In particular, the RDF/XML syntax cannot fully represent a bNode which is the object of more than one statement.  </s>
<s> o The WG believes that extending the RDF/XML syntax so that it can respresent all RDF graphs is beyond the scope of its current charter and resolves to postpone consideration of this issue.  </s>
<s> o The WG actions the editor of the RDF Syntax WD to include in that document a clear statement of the RDF graph structures that RDF/XML is  </s>
<s> unable to represent.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> My only concern is that some of the datatyping schemes might need something like Ntriples++ to describe the graphs they use, and I would like to leave that option open until we get these issues decided.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, OK.  </s>

<s> Hi Pat,  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> My take is that they are equivalent now and we are committed to keeping them equivalent, so it would be ok to close it given that.  </s>
<s> It would be hard to argue its urgent to close this, I'm just trying to get some issues closed off in parallel with working on the biggies.  </s>
<s> How about: o The WG believes that: - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model and Syntax document  </s>
<s> are currently all equivalent and the WG is resolves to maintain that equivalence.  </s>

<s> Sorry Brian, I know you're trying to simplify life but ...  </s>
<s> I have to date agreed with this, but ....  </s>
<s> I'm wavering.  </s>
<s> I'm wavering for three reasons: + with a developer hat on, a developer who controls both an RDF/XML reader and an RDF/XML writer I note that I have a *responsiblity* to my users to fix this problem, at least between my writer and my reader.  </s>
<s> With WG hat on, maybe I can duck that responsibility, but I, at least, need to have a solution; even if it doesn't have WG blessing.  </s>
<s> + this is really a bug, a significant bug, not just an academic bug, a bug with the spec.  </s>
<s> I think it is in charter to fix bugs.  </s>
<s> + there are a number of adequate fixes with adequate backwardly compatible behaviour.  </s>
<s> Viz - a. mandate that all fragment URIs of a particular URI are in fact bNode's and not real URIs e.g. http://www.w3.org/2001/11/rdf/bnode#b1 b. suggest use of processing instruction e.g. ?rdf-fake-uri  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/2001/11/rdf/bnode? c. use of new attribute rdf:local Anyone care to push me over the edge?  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I'm not going to push one way or the other; I understand the attraction of fixing this, but I also understand the charter has a purpose.  </s>
<s> BUT, if we do decide to fix this, I don't like solution (a) or (b).  </s>
<s> However, something like: rdf:Description rdf:local="node" ... seems quite regular and OK.  </s>
<s> Also, it suggests, if needed: rdf:Description rdf:local="node" rdf:literal="literalchars" ... #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
