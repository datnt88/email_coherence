Hi, According to the section 2.6 of the RDF/XML syntax specification[1], the top elment - rdf:RDF - of an RDF document can be omitted if there's only one top-level element inside rdf:RDF. 
In correspondence to this, the following sentence stated in the section 2.1 of [2] should be revised. 
Here's my try: [The Original Sentence] "As with any RDF document, the OWL code should be subelements of an rdf:RDF element." 
[A Revised Sentence] "As with most RDF documents, the OWL code should be subelements of an rdf:RDF element. 
But in the case of OWL codes with only one top-level element, rdf:RDF element can be omitted." 
Regards, Minsu Jang [1] RDF/XML Syntax Specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar) [2] OWL Web Ontology Language Reference (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/) Thanks very much for spotting this. 
In W3C documents "should" has a different requirement level than "must" [1]. 
Therefore, we propose to just change "any" to "most" in the original sentence, as you suggested. 
Please let us know whether you this change is acceptable to you.
