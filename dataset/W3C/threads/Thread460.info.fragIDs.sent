Hi, all 
Has any thought been given to having the parser adjust the input encoding on 
the fly, by looking at the content/charset attribute in the meta element? 
Thanks - rick 
Yes, thought has been given, but it wasn't a goal for the current standalone version. 
We hope to look at doing that for the library version of Tidy. 
Regards, Terry 
I am very interested in the idea of a library version of Tidy - because that's how I'm using the code. 
I have created a library that includes only the parser, based on the 4 Aug 2000 release. 
I don't see anything at the Source Forge site about a library version. 
Would it be possible for you to let me know when issues like design of the API, memory management, initialisation/termination, etc. are being discussed? 
Thanks - rick

The "library" is mentioned, but briefly. 
While some of us have had some initial thoughts for a library, we really haven't started having design discussions - that will probably happen after we release the current standalone version of Tidy. 
To be informed of what is going on with Tidy development, I recommend you get involved by joining the "tidy-develop" mailing list (and move this current discussion from the "html-tidy" mailing list).
