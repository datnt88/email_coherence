Will there be a public draft on Friday? 
(Did I misunderstand or is this the plan?) 
I have some interested people who would like to see the new draft.

Kynn, (and anyone else who is curious) the milestone listed in the charter is to have it public monday. 
We are aiming to actually put it onto TR tomorrow (friday), but since the working group home page, email list, etc is public anyway, if people are particularly interested they can see it from the group home page as soon as it is there. 
(and for that matter, send comments to the list, whether or not they are members of the working group.
