<s> Hello, Today, Jon and I discussed issue 287 (about audio volume checkpoints) [1] (refer to resolution to keep one checkpoint about global control and one about independent control of audio sources [2]).  </s>
<s> Jon made the following comments: 1) Independent control of audio volume is more important for synchronized presentations than for non-synchronized content.  </s>
<s> When content is not intended to be synchronized, users don't need to worry about competing volumes as long as they can play the sources independently.  </s>
<s> Global volume control suffices when you can play different audio sources independently.  </s>
<s> This is covered by the checkpoint to start, pause, resume, etc. audio.  </s>
<s> 2) Speech synthesizer volume is generally handled globally for applications, not on an application-by-application basis.  </s>
<s> 3) "Too much control" (namely, the ability to change the volume of independent audio sources played simultaneously) may require such complex interaction as not to promote accessibility in practice.  </s>
<s> Are we requiring midi user agents to provide an interface to control the volume of each track?  </s>
<s> An equalizer tool (fairly comment to control relative volumes) does not typically work on individual components but on frequencies.  </s>
<s> Would that meet the requirements of this checkpoint nonetheless?  </s>
<s> 4) This is a fairly serious change of scope from the previous checkpoints about volume.  </s>
<s> 5) This discussion suggests a content issue: should the WCAG be recommending that authors provide content in recognizable tracks (e.g., a SMIL presentation) as opposed to formats without tracks (e.g., a WAV file)?  </s>
<s> Based on these comments, I'd like to propose that we reconsider the resolution.  </s>
<s> I have the following wording for the proposed checkpoint (proposed, but in no document yet): "Allow the user to control independently the volumes of audio sources recognized as distinct."  </s>
<s> I propose we create two checkpoints instead to emphasize the critical cases and to reduce the scope of the change: "Allow the user to control independently the volumes of audio sources synchronized to play simultaneously.  </s>
<s> "Allow the user to control the synthesized speech volume independently of other sources of audio."  </s>
<s> Note: It is expected that speech synthesizer volume will be set at the system level.  </s>
<s> Notes: - The second checkpoint is much closer in scope to the previous version of the speech volume checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For example, from the Candidate Recommendation: "Allow the user to configure synthesized speech volume."  </s>
<s> However, the new version talks about control and not just configuration.  </s>
<s> - As usual, if the UA cannot determine that two sources of audio should be played simultaneously, the first checkpoint does not apply.  </s>

<s> Whoops! My apologies: - Issue 287 is about on/off control of multimedia, blink, animations.  </s>
<s> This is still open.  </s>
<s> - Issue 286 is about volumes and was recorded as resolve at the 22 June teleconf.  </s>

<s> In general I agree with the proposal, although I note that the second proposed checkpoint, about synthesized speech, is really just a special case of the first.  </s>
<s> The question raised in my mind is about applicability, and hinges on teh definition of sound sources - what if the speech synthesis and something else are generated by the same system component (whether hardware or software)?  </s>
<s> further comments sprinkled - look for IJ and CMN IJ  </s>
<s> CMN I am not convinced about this - could you please expand if it is important (but I am not sure that it is) IJ  </s>
<s> CMN Yes.  </s>
<s> I think this is already implicit in the use of appropriate structure, but the checkpoints at the moment are very HTML specific.  </s>
<s> I will follow this up on the WCAG list.  </s>
