<s> I feel I should apologize in advance here; I am keenly aware of the fact that the 7-bit-centric-ness of contemporary computer systems is redolent of a lot of really bad Western attitudes, so arguing against complete i18n generality makes me really uncomfortable.  </s>
<s> And in fact some of the things that Henry  </s>
<s> &amp; Gavin &amp; Martin have been saying are very important.  </s>
<s> But, let's review the design principles.  </s>
<s> XML has to be *easy to write  </s>
<s> programs for* - I draw your attention to that anyone competent ought to be able to cook up an XML processor in a few days.  </s>
<s> For this reason, we are probably going to discard a bunch of pieces of SGML that are really potentially very valuable, such as abstract syntax and SHORTREF and LINK - simply because we are happy with the trade-off  </s>
<s> of increased ease of implementation for loss of functional richness.  </s>
<s> So even though I may end up agreeing with Gavin, for the moment I'm going to argue  </s>
<s> the minimalist position, because someone needs to.  </s>
<s> My informal interpretation of our clause 4 ("It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents") has been more or less, "I can do it with flex and yacc".  </s>
<s> Thus, what we need to do is avoid the extremes of (a) retreating into a 7-bit grass hut, and (b) trying to build something handles all the arcana of bit-patterns/glyphs/charsets/encodings.  </s>
<s> Rather, we want something that hits the right trade-off along the spectrum.  </s>
<s> Having said all that:  </s>
<s> I would feel somewhat strange about not supporting native language markup, particularly as we're going to have to use a variant concrete syntax to support native language content.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the most reasonable thing to do would be to decide upon a syntax that used ISO 10646 for both data and markup...  </s>
<s> Well, data for sure.  </s>
<s> The problem is, if we keep markup in 7-bit land, I'm pretty darn sure I can build an efficient parsing/validating system out of flex &amp; yacc in a week or so (because I have), and utf8 data, for example, won't break anything.  </s>
<s> Now, I'm not sure I *can't* do this if we let markup out of the ASCII box, but it's a question that we have to think about carefully, because we're in danger of compromising a central design goal.  </s>
<s> you'd also require all content to be in UTF8, and many users have no way of creating such data.  </s>
<s> In the best cases, producing such data usually involves a conversion somwhere.  </s>
<s> Hmm, for us Westerners there's no problem, because the standard SGML repertoire is utf8 as it sits (right?).  </s>
<s> You're right that your average Japanese editing system doesn't emit UTF8... but I still think that it might be reasonable to say that "in XML, it must be utf8" - so the conversion gets applied on the way in.  </s>
<s> Question: conversions such as {S,N,EUC}JIS - UTF8 and Big5 - UTF8 look very easy in principle - are they, in practice?  </s>
<s> And does software exist?  </s>
<s> Again, we had the same discussion in HTML-WG.  </s>
<s> There are many good reasons for selecting a single document character set, and then just looking upon SJIS and whatnot as encodings.  </s>
<s> I think there are many good reasons - overwhelmingly good - for the SGML case.  </s>
<s> For XML, we should think about sweeping all the charset/encoding subtleties under the rug: it's UTF8 and that's all there is to it.  </s>
<s> Once again, if it's not crystal clear - we want anyone who wants to write a program to  </s>
<s> process XML to be able to go to one place and look at one simple set of rules, and we want the program, once written, to have a very high degree of probability of processing any XML doc in the world *as it sits*.  </s>
<s> If we get this, and as a consequence there is some proportion of documents that XML cannot address, that's a fair price to pay.  </s>
<s> E.g., a trade-off such as "If you *REALLY* *MUST* have the documents in the repository in native Shift-JIS, and can't do conversions in &amp; out, then you have to use real SGML, because it has the machinery for that."  </s>

<s> Note that I do not believe it wise to prescribe what the *internal* representation is, nor the number of possible encodings and XML parser should handle.  </s>
<s> Note that the tables for writing converters from SJIS, EUC, etc. to UNICODE are publically available, and it is easy to use them to automatically generate converters for what you wish to handle.  </s>
<s> UTF8 doesn't solve the worlds problems.  </s>
<s> I think we can fix the character repertoire, but fixing the encoding is arbitrary, and prescribes certain implementation details.  </s>
<s> It also complicates usage.  </s>
<s> [Gavin:]  </s>

<s> I apologize for getting this mixed up (once again) in an earlier comment.  </s>
<s> Let's review the basics for us slower members of the class.  </s>
<s> * The character set allowed in markup or data (e.g., 10646 BMP) and the character encoding put on the wire or in a disk file (e.g., UTF-8)  </s>
<s> are completely different issues.  </s>
<s> * We can specify 10646 as the character set (in the SGML sense) for  </s>
<s> all XML documents while still allowing a much more limited encoding (such as 7-bit ASCII) for the transfer of a particular document instance, assuming that information about which encoding is being used is conveyed when the transmission is established.  </s>
<s> * Notwithstanding the last point, we can (if we want) go farther than saying that 10646 is the XML character set (in the SGML sense) and also say that UTF-8 is the only (or recommended, or expected, or default) encoding that we shall/should/expect to find when we open a file containing an XML document or receive a byte stream during an HTTP session.  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> From: Gavin Nicol gtn@ebt.com  </s>
<s> Date: Tue, 10 Sep 1996 19:55:42 GMT  </s>
<s> I agree that fixing the character repertoire on ISO 10646 is the right way to go.  </s>
<s> (There appears to be consensus on this.) How much  </s>
<s> flexibility to allow with encodings is a difficult issue.  </s>
<s> Going with UTF-8 makes a lot of sense in the Unix world.  </s>
<s> Within a few years I expect to see most Unix platforms supporting UTF-8.  </s>
<s> But the Microsoft Windows world is going with UCS-2 (or UTF-16 which is an extension of UCS-2); system tools (such as Notepad) on Windows NT already support UCS-2, and I would expect Windows 9x to follow suit eventually.  </s>
<s> However, although many platforms do not currently have support for either UTF-8 or UCS-2/UTF-16, my impression is that most of them are planning support for one or the other.  </s>
<s> This suggests the possibility of allowing just these two encodings for XML.  </s>
<s> If we do this, we then have to face the issue of how an XML system will know which encoding is being used.  </s>
<s> I think there's a easy solution to this.  </s>
<s> The Unicode standard recommends that files start with a byte order mark (0xFEFF); since the character 0xFFFE is not a legal character this allows a Unicode system to determine whether big-endian or little-endian byte order is being used.  </s>
<s> Fortunately neither 0xFF nor 0xFE can start the UTF-8 representation of a character (actually I don't think they're legal anywhere).  </s>
<s> So XML could require that a byte order mark be used whenever UCS-2/UTF-16 is being used, and assume UTF-8 when the mark is not present.  </s>
<s> Restricting XML to these two encodings would, as Gavin says, be somewhat arbitrary and would indeed complicate usage at least in the short term for Japanese and European markets.  </s>
<s> I'm very sympathetic to Gavin's point of view here, but what's the alternative?  </s>
<s> - Allow any encoding at all?  </s>
<s> That's an implementation nightmare and users lose the guarantee that any XML system will be able to handle any XML document.  </s>
<s> - If not, what encodings do we allow?  </s>
<s> If we allow SJIS amd EUC, shouldn't we also support the Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean encodings as well, and all the ISO 8859-[123456789] for the Europeans.  </s>
<s> There are many other encodings that have active user communities.  </s>
<s> And if we have lots of possible encodings, we certainly can't auto-detect which are being used.  </s>
<s> The possibilities I can think of are: a) rely on some external mechanism to specify the encoding  </s>
<s> b) use ISO 2022 escape sequences  </s>
<s> c) require each XML file to have a MIME header with a charset parameter  </s>
<s> d) use an attribute in a formal system identifier  </s>
<s> Whichever way we go, there's an enormous step up in complexity over the UTF-8/UCS-2 route.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> Good.  </s>
<s> One down.  </s>
<s> I will tell you exactly what will happen if we do this: 1) People who use ASCII, will pretend they are using UTF-8 2) People who do not use ASCII (SJIS, EUC, JOHAB etc.) will *ignore* this requirement and implement systems that handle the encodings they use every day.  </s>
<s> As you, and many other must also be aware, UNICODE doesn't solve the worlds problems either, just 95% of the more common ones ;-) We have to think of XML being used to deliver things like the classical buddhist texts, dead languages, etc.  </s>
<s> I think it would be quite hard to guarantee that all XML systems will be able to meaningfully intrepret any arbitrary XML document anyway.  </s>
<s> We are defining a data syntax, and parsers, but not an entire  </s>
<s> set of application semantics.  </s>
<s> In addition, allowing any encoding to be used is not the nightmare you make it out to be (it's not particularly pleasant either, and in fact, I argued very strongly for UTF-8 to become the lingua franca of the WWW  </s>
<s> a year and a half ago).  </s>
<s> I have no problem with recommending that UTF-8 or UTF-16 be used for XML, and I will even applaude that stance, but I cannot stand by and watch them become the *only* choice.  </s>
<s> The problem of unlimited encodings can be approched in one of two ways: 1) Limit the encoding an application can accept.  </s>
<s> For browsers, content labelling and negotiation are sufficient to handle this.  </s>
<s> 2) Make the application open-ended by using dynamic link libraries, scripting languages, or whatever, so that encoding conversion modules can be downloaded.  </s>
<s> I am very much in favor of (2), and have a prototype for a langauge that could be used to accomplish this (and Rick also has an idea for a language that would be quite interesting here).  </s>
<s> MIME content labelling.  </s>
<s> This is why I have been fighting for close to 2 years to get client and servers to actually accept, generate, and use the charset parameter on the HTML MIME type: I also proposed a data storage format that could be used to combine such meta-data and the actual data together in a single file.  </s>
<s> God forbid....  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> This is pretty much what my *.mim file type did: it just has a group of MIME headers followed by CRLF, then the data.  </s>
<s> A nice way to go...  </s>
<s> It depends.  </s>
<s> Actually *using* UTF-8/UTF-16 in a meaningfull way in an  </s>
<s> application would be just as difficult as any other encoding, and in  </s>
<s> the case of UTF-16, maybe even more so.  </s>
<s> Having only these two encodings also prescribes certain implementation decisions.  </s>
<s> Supporting a wide range of encodings is certainly less work that supporting a wide range of languages in a browser.  </s>

<s> Can you expound on this a bit?  </s>
<s> What character encodings do you currently use, for what texts, that won't fit into Unicode?  </s>
<s> Do you really have encodings that can't even be handled by putting the characters you need into the private use area of the BMP?  </s>
<s> If you do, I'd really like to know more about it.  </s>
<s> Some of the Chinese encodings have thousands of characters not in Unicode.  </s>
<s> Then we also have live languages that still do not even have a computerised form yet.  </s>
<s> I'm having trouble thinking of serious applications that meet the standard you appear to be setting, i.e. that do not restrict their character sets in any way.  </s>
<s> It's not so much a matter of the application being unrestricted, as the *standard* giving enough freedom of movement to allow applications to be built that would generally fall outsude the mainstream use (for which UNICODE will generally suffice).  </s>
<s> As I noted, we can fix the coded character set to ISO 10646, and we have the BMP, which provides us with enoguh room to accomodate these other applications, provided we do not restrict the list of acceptable encodings.  </s>
<s> As for a serious application: something I have long wanted to do is to build a system in which characters could be registered, along with references to common code points (something like TEI WSD) so that one could build "virtual" character repertoires and "virtual" coded character sets.  </s>
<s> The system would also have glyph server technology so that an application (or perhaps an OS) could retrieve the glyph images as appropriate.  </s>
<s> You can kind of fake this at the moment with SDATA entities.  </s>
<s> C compilers and other language processors do not accept source code in arbitrary coded character sets; nor do editors and word processors, nor do Web browsers.  </s>
<s> This is just a limitation in the implementations.  </s>
<s> They could if they wished.  </s>
<s> The internationalized versions of Mosaic I have seen and heard about do accept more than one coded character set, but they are *not* extensible, in the sense of allowing run-time additions to their capabilities by the end-user.  </s>
<s> They are extensible in the sense of allowing programmers of sufficient skill to recompile them after tinkering with the character-handling code.  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> In the future, I expect JAVA to provide a nice way for people to actually support *arbitrary* encodings, and at some point, a way to render arbitrary character sets.  </s>
<s> I have been doing some work on this on the side.  </s>
<s> Eventually, I would like to see coded character sets as such disappear.  </s>
<s> than to tell them "To handle your unusual writing systems in XML, recode the lexical scanner, recompile, and invoke the XML parser."  </s>
<s> In a well designed system, this is unecessary.  </s>
<s> I should note that I have never said that I wish to *require* that all XML parsers be open-ended.  </s>
<s> I have no problem at all with seeing Latin 1 XML systems, and SJIS XML systems, though I expect most will actually be UNICODE based.  </s>
<s> If one really, really needs arbitrary coded character sets, why not use Real SGML?  </s>
<s> Because it's not necessary to do so.  </s>
<s> [Tim writes]  </s>
<s> Whichever way we go on this, here's a question.  </s>
<s> Suppose we have a mechanism for flagging the encoding of some text, and the top-level entity of some XML doc has been thus flagged as being in encoding X.  </s>
<s> Is it then a requirement that all external entities referenced from the top level also be in encoding X, or do we need to re-evaluate, for example by checking for James' proposed 0xfffe?  </s>
<s> I have been through this so many times in various forums... If you have a document entity in say SJIS, I can see no good reason at all for requiring that all external entities also be in shift-jis.  </s>
<s> For example, say I have a document entity on an NT machine in JAPAN.  </s>
<s> It uses SHIFT-JIS.  </s>
<s> It includes an entity from CHINA in BIG5, and another entity from Thailand in TIS, and another from Europe in ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> Provided we have a single document character set, and some way of indicating the encoding (preferrably via the MIME type, or via FSI attributes), then there is no problem at all, and in fact, there is a great deal of benefit in such a system.  </s>

<s> Its not that I want to have an unrestricted character set its that I want to have a way to inform others that I am employing a particular character set encoding.  </s>
<s> Specifying 1 or 2 such encodings such as UTF-8 and / or UTF-16 is to restrictive.  </s>
<s> Its not that I want an unrestricted number of character sets, I just want to be free to use different encodings of that set, and I standard way to inform others that I am doing this.  </s>
<s> Specifying one or two encodings is to restrictive.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Many people like the encodings that they currently use, have the tools to work with them, and won't be changing anytime to soon.  </s>
<s> 2. UTF-8 / UTF-16 are terribly inefficient encodings for a large number of languages.  </s>
<s> They require 2 or 3 bytes per character when an alternate encoding would require only one.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 is particularly offensive with its blatant western bias.  </s>
<s> No one is going to use these inefficient encodings when they have large amounts of information to store / transmit and they are paying for the bandwidth.  </s>
<s> Moreover, many of the languages that UTF-8 bloats in size by two or three times are those used by countries that have access to the worst computer and communications technology.  </s>
<s> C compilers and other language processors do not accept source code in arbitrary coded character sets; nor do editors and word processors, nor do Web browsers.  </s>
<s> Emacs does pretty well, on X, with character sets represented by fonts in the X library.  </s>
<s> I don't have high hopes for any users who need it to handle EBCDIC all of a sudden.  </s>
<s> The internationalized versions of Mosaic I have seen and heard about do accept more than one coded character set, but they are *not* extensible, in the sense of allowing run-time additions to their capabilities by the end-user.  </s>
<s> They are extensible in the sense of allowing programmers of sufficient skill to recompile them after tinkering with the character-handling code.  </s>
<s> I would say that this is a poor design.  </s>
<s> I don't want end-users to be able to add support for encodings, only programmers.  </s>
<s> But I would like - 1.  </s>
<s> The code that needs to be changed should be isolated from the parser and the rest of the application.  </s>
<s> 2. When I'm done I can still claim that I have an XML application.  </s>
<s> 3. I can communicate to other software that I am using an alternate encoding for my information.  </s>
<s> 4. The parser - application API is isolated from any encoding changes I make.  </s>
<s> On the whole, it seems to me simpler to tell users "To handle your unusual writing systems in XML, translate your documents into Unicode (using the private-use area if you need to) and invoke the XML parser" than to tell them "To handle your unusual writing systems in XML, recode the lexical scanner, recompile, and invoke the XML parser."  </s>
<s> ? Even with a style sheet?  </s>
<s> Perhaps you and Gavin have higher hopes for 'meaningful interpretation' than I do in the first place, but I am having trouble imagining *any* level of interpretation that won't become a lot more complex if the parser must adjust at run time to character sets unknown and unimagined at compile time.  </s>
<s> I am not a DSSSL expert (nor really even a amateur) so I cannot attest to its capabilities.  </s>
<s> I was simply referring to the way ISO 10646 decomposes characters.  </s>
<s> This makes the mapping from code point to glyph non-trivial.  </s>
<s> Multiple ISO 10646 characters may need to be combined to get the composite that is actually displayed.  </s>
<s> This is further complicated by languages such as Arabic in with glyphs change depending on there proximity to other characters.  </s>
<s> Browsers capable of doing this correctly for all languages are difficult and will not exist for a while (if ever).  </s>
<s> There is simply no commercial market for supporting languages like Burmese (which is one of those languages that is not yet in ISO 10646).  </s>
<s> As soon as the font mess is straightened out it will of course be possible to do this rendering at the server, create the correct glyphs, map them into the private use area, send a custom font and at least get the browser to display it.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that allowing arbitrary coded character sets really pushes us over a line between something simple and something that may possibly still be tractable but is surely no longer simple.  </s>
<s> If Unicode is not enough, then a finite and small set of alternate coded character sets can be defined as legal input.  </s>
<s> Allowing arbitrary parse-time extension is not the way to keep XML simple to implement.  </s>
<s> I always make the distinction between the parser, the entity manager and the storage manager.  </s>
<s> The parser sees only UCS-4.  </s>
<s> It is the storage manager that needs to be concerned with character encoding, not the parser.  </s>
<s> I just want a way to add a storage manager to XML to support other encodings, and have a standard way to record in a data stream (possibly outside of SGML) that a specific encoding is being used.  </s>
<s> If one really, really needs arbitrary coded character sets, why not use Real SGML?  </s>
<s> 1. Due to product availability / price considerations.  </s>
<s> 2. Due to the increased performance of XML software over its more feature laden counterpart.  </s>
<s> B. Todd Bauman Graduate Student University of Maryland, Baltimore County  </s>
<s> I was thinking the same thing.  </s>
<s> For better or for worse, most HTML markup is still done by hand, and I would hope that XML would be useful and compelling to the more advanced members of the HTML user community (even those who are not now familiar with SGML).  </s>
<s> Perhaps I could turn this around and ask: is ease of implementation really as crucial as we have been treating it?  </s>
<s> I agree that it should be possible to implement XML much more _efficiently_ than SGML, but I am skeptical that a language that is "fanatically" easy-to-implement but difficult to write data for will achieve more success than an author-centered language with a few free, fast reference implementations.  </s>
<s> Note though, that many of the SHORTTAG features actually make SGML harder to write by confusing authors: "Why do I have to use quotes here, but not here?"  </s>
<s> So I am not advocating that we preserve all (or even most) of the keystroke saving devices in SGML.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> I think that a major goal of XML should be "reliable interoperability".  </s>
<s> I do not think that "support for whatever you need to do" should be a major goal.  </s>
<s> If people start creating standards-compliant SJIS XML documents on the Web and standards-compliang XML client software cannot read it, then we have a PROBLEM, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> When I have heard SGML "sold" I often hear "SGML is completely platform independant".  </s>
<s> People presume that this means that they can take any SGML document from any platform and use it on any other platform.  </s>
<s> Well, SGML is platform independant, but SGML documents aren't really.  </s>
<s> I feel that it is time to make the language where the documents are truly platform independent.  </s>
<s> SGML will always continue to be the flexible language that supports idiosyncratic needs at the possible expense of document portability.  </s>
<s> One last question: Isn't it reasonable to expect that most local encodings could be translated into XML by the HTTP server on transmission?  </s>
<s> If so, there is no loss of convenience in requiring the on-the-wire format to be standardized in the same way that you would expect FTP keywords to always be ASCII and IP packets to have a certain byte-ordering.  </s>
<s> I don't know what we'll decide in the end, Gavin, but isn't it nice that we're talking about Unicode _as a minimum_?  </s>

<s> UTF-8 is particularly offensive with its blatant western bias.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, (apart from Wired, which didn't even credit who these outraged Asians were as far as I can remember) the difficulties people have with Unicode tends to be not so much this encoding or that, but rather that for Han ideographs it follows radical order and not the order in any existing national character set order.  </s>
<s> But I suppose if it had it would be criticised for being "Japanese" or "Taiwanese" or "PRC" biased!  </s>
<s> Also, the round-trip rule and unification makes it impossible to specify other variants in the code.  </s>
<s> However, when SGML is added, who cares?  </s>
<s> All the extra information can be contained in markup: it is just a matter of setting agreed semantics of the markup.  </s>
<s> Unicode seems better than anything before, especially w.r.t. making a character catalog.  </s>
<s> (People may be away of PRC's standard GB13000 which adds all the extra Han ideographs from ISO 10646 onto the previous national standard: retaining backwards compatibility with previous character set.)  </s>
<s> And the issue of user-defined characters is irrelevent unless there is a mechanism for accessing their glyphs over the Web.  </s>
<s> Until there is, there is no point trying to allow for them in XML.  </s>
