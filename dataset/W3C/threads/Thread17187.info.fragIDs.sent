<s> BBC Radio 4 is running an article on web site accessibility as I write this.  </s>
<s> The web page backing the article is at:  </s>
<s> and the real audio should be at:  </s>
<s> I don't have Real Audio tools on Linux to verify this.  </s>
<s> It's about the National Library for the Blind's web site awards, but the audio should cover the lack of difficulty of creating accessible sites, as well; I missed the start, so I'll have to listen to the audio from Windows to get the whole item.  </s>
<s> I can't find a transcript.  </s>
<s> Fortunately they haven't used the random serial numbers in their content management system, so it is possible to preeict the long term name for  </s>
<s> this page (in some cases one has to wait for the next week, before the  </s>
<s> archive name is assigned and then search on content).  </s>
<s> The archive name seems to be: The archive name for the audio is almost certainly:  </s>
<s> See also http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch.shtml , the program's front page.  </s>
<s> There's a link entitled "text only" (white, on a white background - I saw it as the page was coming through my slow modem!) at .. Oh, it's not the program, it's a link to betsie.  </s>
<s> Ugh.  </s>
<s> It was only a short article forming part of their weekly program "for and with" the visually impaired.  </s>
<s> They mention the Web from time to time.  </s>
<s> I heard it all (except where I was distracted by getting my supper).  </s>
<s> Only 2 (of IIRC 10) judges were visually impaired; both the two were using Jaws.  </s>
<s> Where does that leave the majority of blind people who couldn't hope to afford such top-end kit, or who just don't want to deal with a virus-ridden operating system and mandatory GUI?  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> has anyone looked at the 6 winning websites: I can't imagine how got shortlisted let alone won anything.  </s>
<s> it's a great service and in some parts not badly executed but IMO doesn't deserve an award.  </s>
<s> it forces the screenreader to use the text only link, and as if that weren't bad enough it then restricts you to searching only for audio or large print books.  </s>
<s> having the option to search audio or large print would be very handy but restricting people to only these options in unacceptable.  </s>

<s> I so hate this.  </s>
<s> I want to praise these awards for increasing the awareness of accessibility (which they are).  </s>
<s> But they seem to be doing *such* a crap job at it.  </s>
<s> I had a very brief look through the winners, let me see... * The British Museum Compass First page has a meta refresh.  </s>
<s> Beyond that, better than most.  </s>
<s> * Dial UK As scripting was disabled in my browser, I got no style at first due to their poor client-side browser sniffing.  </s>
<s> Otherwise good for accessibility (if a little verbose on the alt text).  </s>
<s> * Guardian Unlimited I'm sorry?  </s>
<s> How on earth did this win an award for accessibility?  </s>
<s> Just look at it in Lynx - http://tinyurl.com/3hu1  </s>
<s> !  </s>
<s> Although the content is quite good, the surrounding design is very poor.  </s>
<s> I just don't know how this could win over BBC News (http://news.bbc.co.uk) or Ananova (http://www.ananova.com/news/).  </s>
<s> Madness.  </s>
<s> * The Local Heritage Initiative Very good.  </s>
<s> * National Maritime Museum Hrm.  </s>
<s> Ok-ish.  </s>
<s> Could be better (and why does the text-only version's link to the graphical version say "HTML version"...?) * Whichbook Whilst they have made clear attempts at making their site more accessible, it's a shame some people won't be able to get into the site in the first place - http://tinyurl.com/3hu5.  </s>
<s> I really fail to understand how these awards have been worked out.  </s>
<s> There are many, many more deserving sites than the few that have won them.  </s>
<s> Very odd indeed.  </s>
<s> But I have to say well done for the organizers for attempting something like this, and to the BBC for covering the story.  </s>
<s> Tom Gilder  </s>
<s> wonder how many alternative browser users were on the selection committee?  </s>
