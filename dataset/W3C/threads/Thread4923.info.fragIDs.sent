This use case is a simple transformation of an XML structure. 
It is useful when the document type shows a wide variation in structure. 
It would go nicely under 1.2. in The expected result is based on the sample data in 1.2.3. 
Query: Return the book without image elements. 
Preserve everything else of the book element. 
Expected result: I actually replaced the image elements with a comment which could contain something else, as well, e.g. the alternative text of the image or the name of the source file. 
Presumably, there is a solution for this use case. 
See 3.4.11 in

Hi Miro, We will discuss this proposal at our next meeting and will get back to you in the next weeks. 
Please, see my response to your email to member-query-fttf@w3.org Regards, Sihem 
Hi Sihem, I actually meant this use case to be considered for one of the XML Query Use Cases: This is not a full-text related use case, but there is a corresponding use case being that. 
The use case related to the full-text queries is similar to this one, but the exclusion of content is based on scores instead of element names. 
I'll comment on the possible solutions at member-query-fttf@w3.org. 
Regards, Miro
