<s> This use case is a simple transformation of an XML structure.  </s>
<s> It is useful when the document type shows a wide variation in structure.  </s>
<s> It would go nicely under 1.2. in The expected result is based on the sample data in 1.2.3.  </s>
<s> Query: Return the book without image elements.  </s>
<s> Preserve everything else of the book element.  </s>
<s> Expected result: I actually replaced the image elements with a comment which could contain something else, as well, e.g. the alternative text of the image or the name of the source file.  </s>
<s> Presumably, there is a solution for this use case.  </s>

<s> Hi Sihem, I actually meant this use case to be considered for one of the XML Query Use Cases: This is not a full-text related use case, but there is a corresponding use case being that.  </s>
<s> The use case related to the full-text queries is similar to this one, but the exclusion of content is based on scores instead of element names.  </s>
