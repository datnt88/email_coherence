<s> I'm starting to think it's worth unravelling all these barnacles around literals and going back to just to just strings, URIs, and bnodes as terms in RDF triples/graphs.  </s>
<s> no lang no c14n no datatypes rationale: no lang: the RDF query guys have been collecting use cases for a while; this one was suggested last June, and unlike all the others, nobody has reported a solution/implementation: Find the language specific value of a property [image] Retrieve the value of a property for a particular language (as specified by xml:lang).  </s>
<s> Specifically, retrieve the english description of each class specified in Published by Geoff Chappell on 2002-06-25 the folks that really need lang functionality are using real triples: see 4.2 Poor mans language qualification in When the WG made the xml literal decision, I yielded because my alternative (representing XML infosets ala lisp s-expressions) was more complex than I could justify.  </s>
<s> But if we use simple str xmlrep:parsesAs _:infosetDataStructure interpretation properties, life gets much simpler.  </s>
<s> I haven't worked out all the details, but I think it works better for stuff like XML query integration in the long run; Implementation experience: (EricM, cf your "XML infoset modelling" action in the SemWeb CG) I know interpretation properties work in my apps for datatypes too; while I suspect putting datatypes into the abstract syntax doesn't minimize cost in the long term, I don't have direct evidence yet, the way I do for lang.  </s>
<s> I wanna see our design integrated with SQL engines.  </s>
<s> I pushed on that in after-hours chat a bit today, and Dave B and Jeremy said our design does fit with contemporary SQL implementation work.  </s>
