I understand that one of the action items currently in progress pertains to the development of a mechanism for representing print page numbers in HTML documents. 
This requirement is especially significant when the HTML document is a transcript of a text that was originally supplied in printed form, and it is desirable that users be able to refer to the page numbers of the source document. 
The most obvious application would be the use of HTML in the preparation of electronic texts for people with print disabilities. 
I have thought of a solution which, if valid, would not require any modification to the HTML Cougar proposal. 
Essentially, it involves taking advantage of the id attribute defined by HTML Cougar, as in the following example: P Last line from print page 2. span ID=ipp3 First line from print page 3. This would make the pagination available to speech and braille user agents. 
One disadvantage of this suggestion is that existing user agents would not display the ID value as part of the text of the document. 
It might even be possible for id values beginning with the letters "ipp" to be reserved as print page indicators. 
If necessary, the page number could be stated twice, once in an ID value and, immediately thereafter, in the text of the document. 
End of page 2. span ID=ipp3 {3} Start of page 3. I am not completely sure that the above proposal is technically accurate, but I understand from reading Cougar material that the ID attribute is available in sufficiently many contexts to make this kind of approach feasible. 
I also recall reading that id values must be unique; this would allow verification software to detect inadvertent duplication of page numbers within a document.

I'm forwarding a message that was sent to the list very early on. 
Note that it's related to the action items under ICADD in the list at http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/actions.html. 
(I updated the list with pointers) From: Murray Maloney To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag. 
The use of A in this case requires the use of standardized values for the REL and REV attributes, and a convention for the names of target anchors. 
We need conventions for pointing to a target anchor and asserting that it represents the beginning of an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page". 
There are two potential and complementary mechanisms available: - Use a naming conventions for identifying anchors, such as "IPP-[0-9]+", "IPP-[ivxlc]", "BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc. - Use REL="BPP" or REL="IPP" I assert that it would be helpful and reliably redundant to utilize both methods, and am recommending that.

The proposal for using anchor elements is undoubtedly superior and I would support it. 
However, they may be one potential problem. 
Admittedly, I have not found time to read the entire CSS specification, but the initial sections of that document indicate that only class and id attributes can be used as selectors, not rel and rev attributes. 
Since it would be desirable to be able to apply special speech or braille styles to anchor elements that designate page numbers as distinct from other occurrences of anchors, it may be necessary to use the class attribute in addition to, or in place of, the rev and rel attributes. 
Another possibility would be to modify CSS syntax to enable rev and rel attributes to act as selectors. 
I apologize in advance if these remarks are mistaken, since I really should have read all of the CSS documents before commenting.

There is a very good remark, Jason, I also made them at the Sophia meeting :-) 
[BTW, is using smileys in the text something that bothers blind users or is is OK ?] 
CSS will probably be extended with more selectors but the issue of 
readyness is important so using CLASS, NAME or ID is better than REL. 
Normally this is not a problem: they will be either announced as punctuation marks by a speech synthesizer, or ignored, depending on the setting of the relevant parameters in the screen reader. 
Braille displays will simply render them as punctuation. 
readyness is important so using CLASS, NAME or ID is better than REL. 
Does CSS provide a mechanism for matching, as a selector, any name attribute with a value of the form "IPP-[0-9]+"? 
Note that it would be 
insufficient to select just any anchor element containing a name attribute; it is necessary to identify only those that are actually being used for representing page numbers. 
If the name attribute could be used, 
there would be no need to modify the original proposal. 
Otherwise, class would be needed. 
Also, the format of the page number could be extended to permit a single letter prefix to precede the page number. 
Some documents, an example of which I am reading at the moment, contain multiple series of page numbers which need to be kept distinct. 
Thus, page numbers such as a31, h18 etc., should be allowed, and similarly for Roman numerals, provided that one is careful in one's choice of available letters so as to avoid ambiguity. 
One could also consider more difficult cases such as the reference schemes that are used to identify passages in ancient Greek texts, but these are perhaps so rare on the web as not to warrant attention. 
In any case, documents employing these references might well be encoded in XML rather than HTML.

Attribute value exact matching is in the oven for the next version of CSS. 
Attribute value pattern matching hasn't been discussed I think. 
CLASS or ID value are possible selector today but no pattern matching either. 
One possibility is: That would allow CSS selection as in A.IPP {...} or even A#IPP-17 {...} Link could point at them using Note that I used both NAME and ID in the target A because although Cougar now supports ID as HREF, only NAME were supported before. 
To elaborate on link A, we could have Go to Print Page 17 /A Note that I used a different CLASS name, so that CSS can use different selector for different rendering of link vs. target anchor. 
(this is what was achieved with REL and REV in Murray's proposal) I actually think using REL and REV is a better fit in theory, but CSS of today does not support using them as selector, so it's another of those "what is the timeframe of our solution?" 
issue. 
In this case though, we could recommend both methods (CLASS/ID naming + use of REL/REV), as the original IPP/BPP proposal recommends. 
Murray's proposal had IPP-[0-9]+" and "IPP-[ivxlc]", but in general I think the convention should mention IPP (and BPP) as being the "class" and the rest is free use (numeral, roman, letter). 
doesn't bother me. 
you can use the ascii ones too or something like g or grin if you like. that actually show up in pine.
