B.1.3. 
Use relative sizing and positioning rather than absolute. 
I'm not sure what this is referring to. 
In the FONT element there is no way in HTML 4.0 to do anything other than the relative 1-7 font sizes. 
Navigator has a proprietary attribute to FONT called POINT-SIZE but this fall under the edict of not using proprietary extensions to HTML. 
If this is a style sheet issue, then it shouldn't be a problem because the user should be able to override the value with their own style sheet settings. 
Anyone know what this is about? 
Josh Krieger CAST Unfortunately, this is not as simple as it may seem. 
Suppose that the author's style sheet establishes a particular font size for the body of the document, and a larger font size for first-level headings. 
Let it be supposed further that the user's style sheet overrides the declaration by the author that refers to the body of the document. 
Now, if the author has used relative (EM and EX) units to specify font sizes at lower levels of the document tree (the first level headings in the present example), then these will be scaled appropriately once the user's style sheet has established a new body font. 
However, if the author has instead employed absolute font sizes, then the result is that the first level headings would retain their original size, which may be less than the new "body" size established by the user. 
The only recourse, in this case, is for the user to include the INHERIT keyword in the body font size declaration; but the disadvantage here is that the author's font distinctions are entirely lost. 
So far as the proprietary attributes are concerned, they should be avoided. 
Relative font sizes should be used in style sheets as argued above. 
I know what it's about - I wrote it. 
It is a style sheet issue rather than an HTML issue. 
I think the problems have been very neatly answered by Jason.
