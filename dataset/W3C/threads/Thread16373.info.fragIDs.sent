<s> Dear friends, As you know: - Portugal is the first European country where web accessibility is mandatory; - On 8 December 1999 the European Commission launched an initiative entitled "eEurope - An Information Society for All", which propose: "By the end of 2001: The European Commission and Member States should commit themselves to making the design and content of all public Web sites accessible to people with disabilities."  </s>
<s> The eEurope plans are due to be definitively approved at a special EU meeting on employment to be held in Lisbon, Portugal in March 2000 What you think about an online international Petition for the Accessibility on the Internet in European Union supporting the European Commission proposal ?  </s>
<s> You can find an example at http://www.acessibilidade.net/eeurope  </s>
