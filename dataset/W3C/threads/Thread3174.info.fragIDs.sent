<s> I've seen a lot of traffic in this list discussing the use of passwords, how necessary they are and how insecure, etc. etc.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any mention of the use of techniques like Bellovin-Merrit's for preventing dictionary attacks.  </s>
<s> Certainly, these techniques improve significantly on the security of passwords (particularly, low-entropy ones).  </s>
<s> BM solutions and related ones use public key techniques which are already available in SSL.  </s>
<s> Did anyone considered using them?  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of *any* real-world implementation of such techniques (not necessarily related to SSL)?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Hugo  </s>
<s> It turns out that this was a very good way to advertise Bellovin-Merrit's work.  </s>
<s> So I got no single answer to whether an implementation exists or about its potential usability within SSL.  </s>
<s> Instead I got eight personal messages asking for the reference to the papers.  </s>
<s> There are two papers on this subject by these authors.  </s>
<s> They call the technique "encrypted key exchange".  </s>
<s> The first paper appeared in Oakland conference 1992, the second in ACM Security 1993.  </s>
<s> I found an on-line version of both papers under Look for the phrase "encrypted key exchange" (the papers are NOT listed under the "password" section of that page).  </s>
<s> Anyway, if anyone has an answer to my previous posting I'll be glad to hear.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'm new to this list so I don't know if this has been mentioned.  </s>
<s> Regarding the discussion of SSL not supporting the use of passwords, has SSH been considered by the IETF TLS?  </s>
<s> It supports the use of encrypted passwords as well as pure RSA authentication.  </s>

<s> Hugo: We did at one point consider Bellovin-Merritt for shared-key authentication, but we decided that requiring server certification was not a big sacrifice in the contexts we had in mind, and yielded better security and fewer changes to existing infrastructure and code.  </s>
<s> (For example, Bellovin-Merritt would require clients to monitor for online brute-force attacks on the password.)  </s>
<s> Of course, if you want to propose an extension allowing for BM-style two-way shared-key-based authentication as an option in TLS, we'd have no objections to its inclusion.  </s>
