<s> Actually, I suspect the DeltaV meeting probably won't overlap the WebDAV WG meeting.  </s>
<s> Upon a closer look, there were actually no times specified in Jim Amsden's message announcing the DeltaV design team meetings.  </s>
<s> I just assumed they were from 9 to 5. In the past the DeltaV design team hasn't met during the WebDAV WG meeting.  </s>
<s> As for the ACL BOF, I think a useful meeting would be to have a design walkthrough of the current specification.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that everyone has given the latest draft a thorough examination.  </s>

<s> Yes, the DeltaV meeting will definitely not overlap the WebDAV WG, so the Wed DeltaV meeting will be 9-3:15 rather than 9-5:00.  </s>
<s> BTW, I definitely will be at the 3:30-5pm DeltaV design meeting on Thursday, so there will be at least one person there (:-).  </s>
<s> I agree with Eric that since there are no open issues with the ACL draft, that a ACL BOF is not needed (we can walk through the ACL protocol in the WebDAV WG time slot ... it's a very short protocol).  </s>
<s> Especially with DeltaV going to last call, I personally would rather put that time into DeltaV.  </s>
<s> So I propose we not have an ACL BOF on Wed.  </s>
