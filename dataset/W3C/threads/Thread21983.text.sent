Hello List, me and a fellow student (TU Ilmenau, Germany) are about to begin a student research project about adaptation of webcontent for mobile devices (PDA an WebPad) - especially, concerning the needs of (visually) handicapped people. 
We planned to use CC/PP. 
Within the framework of our inquiry we are now looking for existing projects or articles about implementations dealing with the adaptation of webcontent. 
I would be pleased about every hint, link or whatever. 
:) We need some inspiration. 
Thank you for your help, Lars Wulfken.

Greetings, you might like to take a look at the Consensus project, it includes some open source code that may be of interest. 
It doesn't include CC/PP support but it could be plugged in. 
Regards, Roland "Lars Wulfken" lars.wulfken@stud.tu-ilmenau.de
