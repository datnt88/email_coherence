<s> Dear Members of the DI working group, as a contribution to the DI group's work on authoring techniques and interaction markup, the Consensus Consortium hereby submits a document about layout specification in renderer-independent markup language.  </s>
<s> The document is publicly accessible at the Consortium homepage https://www.consensus-online.org/publicdocs/20031021-RIML-layout.pdf  </s>
<s> The submitted layout module is part of a larger language profile called RIML.  </s>
<s> RIML is based on XHTML 2.0 WD and XFORMS 1.0 and was defined by the Consortium to assist single-authoring of web content.  </s>
<s> The Consortium created a reference implementation of an adaptation proxy which interprets RIML and produces browser-specific markup.  </s>
<s> It is hoped that the availability of both specification and implementation helps to accelerate the provision of single-authoring environments based on W3C standards.  </s>
