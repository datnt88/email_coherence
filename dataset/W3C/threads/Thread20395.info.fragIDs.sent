<s> At any rate, I believe David Woolley answered my question entirely.  </s>
<s> I searched the web and found some indication that there might be a non-microsoft solution to the NTLM problem but didn't research it further.  </s>

<s> If it is using NTLM authentication, you are locked into IE; not even Netscape supports that.  </s>
<s> In that case, get it reconfigured for Basic Authentication, but note that clear text equivalent passwords will go over the LAN.  </s>

<s> Note that you can avoid clear text passwords by using Digest Authentication, or (probably better supported) SSL aka HTTPS.  </s>
<s> These are Internet standards, unlike the proprietary and buggy NTLM.  </s>
