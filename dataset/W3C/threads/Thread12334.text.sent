Hi, I have made a pretty major change to the images evaluation draft. 
I have broken up the document by adding evaluator instructions (such as "Insert an image") after which, the questions related to that action are listed by priority (rather than having the main grouping be by priority). 
So the breakdown would now be: 1. Major functional area (images, multimedia, etc.) 2. Functional task(inserting an image, editing text properties) 3. Priority level I have also taken out the P2 relative items since there are no P2 equivalent alternatives. 
Also, the second section, relating to image editors, is not converted yet. 
I want to get feedback first. 
Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto Jan, I like the way you have chopped up the document - this seems like a good model to work with. 
I think we should take the test files out of the document and have them as linked test cases, but I will do this when I put this together with the other things that we have. 
Also, I am not sure that a percentage result is very useful, since the same score can apply to tools that are very different. 
I am thinking that it would be good to split this also into stuff that is essentially help information (definitions, technology-specific information) and stuff that is evaluation procedures. 
cheers - keep up the good work Charles W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia You're right. 
The scorecard I have in there is really just a placeholder. 
I think we can do a lot better in the real version. 
Agreed. 
Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto Hello all, Here is the next version. 
This includes a draft process for image editors. 
It is still not totally thought out. 
If we are going to apply our guidelines to image editors, I think we will need to suggest ways of storing EAs outside text tracks as well as produce a tool that can view all the image formats concerned as well as text track and separate EAs.
