Hi 
Does TAP's use of SOAP for query make use of the (cachable, URI-linkable etc) HTTP GET method, or is it over HTTP POST? 
binding, and http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/#WebMethodFeature the oddly named 'SOAP Web Method Feature', which as I understand it is SOAP's way of allowing SOAP services with GET-like semantics to use HTTP's GET method. 
Maybe I should be asking two questions: TAP's GetData in the abstract, vs the Stanford implementation of it...? 
Anyway, further clues gratefully received, cheers, Dan ps. for an RDF protocol that does use GETs, 
By default the TAP toolkit uses POST because we throw around a lot of hierarchical queries which are difficult to express in a flat name=value format like HTTP GET, but the servers support GET syntax, c.f.

Thanks, that's good to know. 
Is the GET syntax documented anywhere? 
Dan 
Not that I know of. 
It's relatively simple: the names of each ?name=value 
pair are properties, the value is the desired value of that property in the request description. 
In the first case, the properties you want the values for are specified by name=value pairs where the name is "prop". 
Abbreviations are allowed, or full URLs. 
tap:Actor is equivalent to such as "rdf:type" and "rdfs:label".
