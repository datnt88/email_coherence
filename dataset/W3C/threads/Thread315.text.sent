If you ever get the time to let me know what my error is, that would be terrific, but I don't expect you to have time, so PLEASE dont feel in any way that I am asking you to do so!! =). 
I have been experimenting with Tidy and cannot figure out a way to prevent it from rendering my Javascript rollovers in all lower case (ie: onMouseOver becomes onmouseover). 
This crashes in IE (of course...)  :( . 
I am using Tidy in 1st Page 2000 and have tested this in the TidyGUI linked to from your page. 
I have not tested it with the Command Prompt version you offer, however. 
Not certain that this is a bug or an avoidable aspect or my blind eyes ( a "big picture" mindset makes the fine print hard to read ... hmmm wondering if perhaps I have wasted a lot of money on programming training after all... ) Anywho, love the app, and my Postcard will be on the way um... soon! 
; ) For now, I am from Toronto Ont., CAN Thanks for a marvellous app! 
Marcus Marcus -- there should be absolutely no reason for IE to fail on lowercase event names. 
What version of IE are you testing against? 
Feel free to send me the problem code privately if you like.

Marcus From my testing, IE5 doesn't care what the case is for attribute names such as onmouseover. 
Indeed, XHTML defines this attribute as all lower case. 
I suspect some other problem is causing your page to fail in IE. Take a look at my tutoral on html and CSS which works in both Navigator and IE. Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org 
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) Hello Dave, Even though XHTML defines attributes to be lowercase, I (and I guess a couple other authors, too) would be happy to see an option introduced which alows to have attribute rendered in mixed case as well as either upper or lower case. 
I might have said this before, but just thought this'd be a good reason to throw in my $.02 again... :-) Bottom line: if not too much hassle, we'd greatly appreciate you to add "mixed case attributes" as an option for the config file. 
Also, I would very much appreciate an option to drop unknown attributes. 
My current workaround, to drop known FALSE attributes, CAN'T be the right approach... ;-) Or did I miss something and this is actually already possible?
