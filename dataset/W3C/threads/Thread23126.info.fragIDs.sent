<s> This would be more appropriate as an read-only attribute.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> description is insufficient since it doesn't explicitly explain under what conditions the implementation is able and required to determine that the content model only contains elements.  </s>
<s> It has been the case in the past, until someone realized that the Java binding contained the following method: boolean getWhitespaceInElementContent() In the Java beans world, boolean attributes are mapped to setX() and isX(), instead of of setX() and getX().  </s>
<s> The description says: The text node is determined to contain whitespace in element content during the load of the document or if validation occurs while using Document.normalizeDocument().  </s>
<s> isn't that sufficient?  </s>

<s> Section 8.3.2 of the Java Beans Specs is Property Name () as an alternative or in addition to boolean get Property Name ().  </s>
<s> Several existing boolean properties are mapped to get Property Name (), such as Attr.getSpecified().  </s>
<s> There are a few boolean properties in the HTML (HTMLInputElement.isMap),  </s>
<s> Views (VisualImage.isLoaded,  </s>
<s> VisualFormButton.isPressed) and Validation (CharacterDataEditVAL.isWhitespaceOnly) that start with "is" and are presumably mapped to getIs Property Name () in the Java binding, however I suspect the Java bindings are rarely used.  </s>
<s> Using a method with a name starting with "is" generates a method in the Java binding that is recognized as a boolean property accessor, but makes it look like a method call in those bindings (like ECMAScript) that actually support properties.  </s>
<s> I would suggest enhancing the stylesheet that generate the binding to suppress the "get" when the property name starts with "is" and the type is boolean.  </s>
<s> An exception could be made for HTMLInputElement.isMap to avoid breaking the existing interface definition.  </s>
<s> MSXML.preserveWhitespace and JAXP's isIgnoringElementContentWhitespace() had different interpretations of when whitespace should be preserved.  </s>
<s> MSXML would discard whitespace without requiring a Document Type Declaration which would result in whitespace being lost in the rare case that the content model was mixed and only whitespace appeared in addition to elements.  </s>
<s> JAXP implementations would require a DTD and validation (at least when the DTD was in an external subset) to be sure that the content model was explicitly element-only.  </s>
<s> In addition, we have the example of Xerces's implying the need to load an external subset DTD in order to provide default attribute values.  </s>
<s> Similarly, you could imply that you need to load an external subset DTD to determine if the content model was element-only or mixed so you could properly determine this property.  </s>
<s> However, all this would be moot if "isWhitespace" and "isElementContent" are separated.  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
<s> For Java, if an attribute starts with "is" that is followed by an upper case character, then the getter keeps the name as-is.  </s>
<s> The setter replaces "is" with "set".  </s>
<s> Only exception is HTMLInputElement.isMap as suggested.  </s>
<s> IsId and isWhitespaceInElementContent (now renamed to isElementContentWhitespace) are back to be attributes again.  </s>
<s> We renamed the method to make it clear that it reflects the Infoset property "elenment-content-whitespace".  </s>
<s> Also added a link to the Infoset in the description.  </s>
