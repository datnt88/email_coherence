Hi, 
I am confused. 
Although it seems to work for everybody, it doesn't for me. 
I mean quote-nbsp set to yes. 
Attached you shall 
find my tidy.ini, but the result is the same on every platform available to me -- Linux, M$-Win95, M$-Win98, M$-DOS. 
When I use named entity &amp;nbsp; in my HTML document, it is always transformed in chr($A0) by tidy (not even numerical entity). 
Unfortunately, being from Eastern Europe I have to use at least three character encodings and transfer between them all the time. 
Unfortunately, some convertors understands chr($A0) as &amp;aacute; which is a frequent character in the Czech language, so resulting text is rather unusable. 
Asking in html-tidy has not give me any responses, so I do not know, what to do. 
Will you help me, anybody, please?

I don't know if this is the cause of your problem or not - did you type the following into this EMail, or did you copy/paste from your actual "tidy.ini" 
file? 
Because, there is at least 1 error in the following : 
This should be : quote-ampersand: yes 
Hope this helps.

Hello Matej, 
Please try the following modifications to your tidy.cfg. 
I am not sure about the char-encoding: latin1, but the way I understand this, it should leave Czech special chars untouched.... 
Also, you had quote-nbsp set to "no", which of course was wrong. 
quote-ampersand was misspelled and break-before-br should be set to no as otherwise you would always have a whitespace at the end of the line (in most common browsers at least). 
I hope this helps.... Sebastian char-encoding: latin1 quote-nbsp: yes quote-ampersand: yes break-before-br: no 
This looks like the documentation needs to be clarified. 
If you set quote-nbsp to no, Tidy will output non breaking spaces as the Unicode value 160 (decimal). 
I recommend leaving this property as yes (its default value), and deciding whether you want numerical entities or not using the numeric-entities property.
