<s> The problem is that not every attribute value that can be used for the name attribute is also valid as an id, not sure how to best resolve this.  </s>
<s> Option 1: The current behaviour, which does not change the id and name values but may result in invalid IDs.  </s>
<s> Option 2: Change just the id value if needed, which results in id and name not being consistent any more.  </s>
<s> Option 3: Change both the id and name values, which ensures consistency but can break links within the document, or from another document.  </s>
<s> I believe Option 1 is still the best choice, although tidy should warn about the invalid id attribute value right away, not only when running it against the document again.  </s>
