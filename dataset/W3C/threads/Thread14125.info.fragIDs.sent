There are a number of places in the Web Content Techniques document [1] where ALT text is less than ideal. 
The most serious ones are the following, but some others could probably be improved: Section 4.4.1: 
alt="Item" should probably be alt="* " The list right now looks like: ItemAudrey ItemLaurie ItemAlice when it should look like: * Audrey * Laurie * Alice Section 4.7.7: 
Since there are alternate texts for the image map later, perhaps the map itself should just have alt=""? 
Section 5.3.1: 
alt="Example in big red characters" should be replaced by alt="example". 
The sentence This is an Example in big red characters of what we mean. is a bit strange, while This is an example of what we mean. 
makes much more sense.

I tend to support these comments. 
A suitable text equivalent for a graphical bullet might be ALT="*", but in general, user agents tend to insert their own bullets for list items, and thus an empty ALT string 
would seem preferable. 
Also, as the Techniques Document should (and probably does -- I have not had a chance to read the latest draft) emphasize, graphical bullets are best controlled by style sheets (an image can be designated in CSS 2 as 
a list item bullet). 
Given that a textual equivalent fulfils the function of the multimedia content, and in general does not describe it, the ALT text referring to "big red letters" in the quoted example should not do so; as suggested, the text itslf is equivalent. 
Of course, a better solution would be to use style sheets to produce the required font effect, or even: where the image represents the logo, in a special font. 
Excuse me, but we seem to be drifting away from the specific point, which was about a _deprecated_ example within the technique 4.4.1 "Use style sheets to change list bullets". 
and thus an empty ALT string would seem preferable. 
In this specific deprecated example, no. 
But the point, surely, is that the example is being deprecated not merely because it has an inappropriate ALT text, but because it is abusing DL / DD to make a UL with a custom bullet. 
Haggling over what the ALT text ought to be is to miss the point of why the example is being deprecated, I would suggest. 
Which is precisely what this technique (4.4.1) was intended to promote. 
This makes me uneasy about the potential for misunderstanding the significance of this "deprecated example". 
After all, if its significance is not clear to the participants in this special interest group, how can we expect our wider audience to understand what it is intended to tell them? 
Of course, this is always a risk when showing a "deprecated example", which makes it all the more important to spell out just what the example is supposed to be illustrating.
