<s> It seems to me that the BIND spec does not introduce a "bind" feature to be reported in the DAV header of an OPTIONS response.  </s>
<s> I think this should be added for the following reasons: The feature list in the DAV header is useful for clients in deciding which PROPFINDs need to be done in order to discover all that is to know (= live properties) of a resource.  </s>
<s> The nice thing about the DAV header is that a client can expect this header to be rather static during the lifetime of a session.  </s>
<s> In contrast, the supported-live-property-set can change quite dramatically during the lifetime of a resource.  </s>
<s> If a PROPFIND on DAV:resource-id will yield a meaningful response cannot be deducted from the Allow header, since on non-collection resources the BIND method will not be reported there.  </s>

<s> I don't find this use case very compelling.  </s>
<s> You can just ask for all the properties you care about, and then let each resource return it if it supports it.  </s>
<s> But I don't violently object, so if the consensus is to add "bind" feature to the DAV header, that's OK with me.  </s>
