Yes, we decided to use the ISO-latin encoding when it exists. 
That reduces the size of documents. 
I believe ISO-latin-1 also maps to the first 256 characters of Unicode.

You're right if you only consider the value of characters but the encoding UTF-16 or UTF-8 differs from the ISO encoding. 
Actually only UTF-8 differs. 
I belive ISO-latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) exactly maps to UTF-16 when zero extended (zero high byte).

When you are reading a file it's different: you have to read one byte in one case and two bytes in the other case. 
Well, obviously!
