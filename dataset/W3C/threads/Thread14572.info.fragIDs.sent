<s> Thursday, 15 February, 2100 UTC (4 PM Boston, 10 PM Sophia, 8 AM Melbourne), on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, with the following agenda: 1. WCAG 2.0 issues, as follows: a. Note accompanying guidelines 1 referring to user agent capabilities: does this designate the capabilities of what the user actually has, or the user agent/assistive technology that they could acquire?  </s>
<s> Is this a relevant question here?  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> Should we add a requirement that audio-only timed interactions should be synchronzied (presumably with text?) This issue was raised at an earlier meeting.  </s>
<s> Essentially it was the question of how to treat medium-specific content (other than multimedia) which requires a time-based response.  </s>
<s> 2. Management of the process by which techniques will be developed, tested and approved.  </s>
<s> We need to determine the framework in which the techniques will be developed, in preparation for the face to face meeting, large parts of which will be devoted to techniques.  </s>
<s> 3. Documentation of assumptions: we resolved last week to incorporate questions of user agent capability, so far as possible, in to the task of developing techniques, as it arises at a technology-specific level.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, the issue still emerges at a higher (checkpoint) level: see checkpoint 1.7, and possibly elsewhere in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> How should we define the requirement of checkpoint 1.7, or should it be moved into an introductory (or advisory) section and out of the checkpoints as such?  </s>
<s> Or, if we decide that the Techniques will in any respect be normative, should checkpoint 1.7 be tied to the specific (evolving) requirements established at the technique level?  </s>

<s> RE: Action item from last meeting An initial draft test plan/procedure for techniques is available for review and comment at comments) Also there is a sample of what a resulting test page might look like at this sample looks at animated gifs since the subject has come up on the IG list.  </s>

<s> Marti, A good procedure, but in looking at the sample page, I see a serious lack of information that would be useful to the owner of the page.  </s>
<s> Some rests in the choice of example, since "annoying and distracting" are subjective values, and further, the state of being annoyed isn't a disability - for some people, it's a way of life!  </s>
<s> I do prefer the working in the 508 guidelines (which I too lazy to quote), which specifies a precise measure of what "flash" speed is disabling and therefore illegal ... The example did not use any precise definition of the problem.  </s>
<s> An addition to the tester's questions could include as #6 Recommendation ... for example, in the example "annoying and distracting gifs", the problem could be simply solved if the flash rate were slowed down enough to be able to see what the pictures are.  </s>
<s> I don't have a stopwatch, but the pictures change in less than a second, which isn't long enough for recognition ... and I hope no one is still promoting subliminal messages!  </s>
<s> Clicking on Stop doesn't help if you want to see the pictures, it just stops the flash ... Oh, and a concern with volunteer testers is that you could end up skewing your data if you don't have a true "representative" team of testers.  </s>
<s> Not all disabilities and in-use assistive technology would be adequately represented if you only used volunteers ... Anne  </s>
