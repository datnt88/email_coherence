<s> Would an iterator make sense in the DOMConfiguration?  </s>
<s> That would allow the properties to be discovered dynamically, instead of hardwiring strings like "canonical-form" in applications.  </s>
<s> Or perhaps a getNextProperty()?  </s>

<s> I think that would make a really nice addition.  </s>
<s> Not sure how widely it would actually be used, however.  </s>

<s> Making use of the 'format-pretty-print' property.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, Xerces-J-2_5_0 has not fully implemented this yet... Thanks, Jeff  </s>

<s> Iterator I guess the DOM way would be something like DOMStringList getPropertyNames(); In our application the use case is that we have a graphical tool that on loading/ saving XML files shows all the DOM Load/ Save properties with checkboxes, everything about that form is dynamic apart from determining the list of properties.  </s>
<s> Once you have a property name you can determine whether it's a boolean property, default value and what is supported etc. Kind regards, --Sander.  </s>
<s> We added a read-only attribute parameterNameList, of type DOMStringList, on the DOMConfigurationList.  </s>
<s> This gives you the possiblity of iterating through the parameter names supported by the object.  </s>
<s> Note that this list can also contain parameter names defined outside the specification., i.e. extensions provided by the implementation.  </s>
