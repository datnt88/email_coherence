Regarding the excellent rate given by LIFT to pacareerlink.state.pa.us 
Although the page rendered by the browser actually shows a number of usability problems, LIFT is unable to identify them because the main page simply starts a javascript script, and LIFT currently skips any sort of scripts. 
This is the page that LIFT downloads and actually evaluates: function jumpOn() form = document.frmJump; 
//alert("Micah Mood is working on the browser detect (9/17/99 3:50 pm)\nbrowser name = " + cBrowserName + "\nversion = " + iBrowserVersion); form.submit(); for which there is not much to say. 
USABLENET TECH SUPPORT Well, one important point for tools is that if there is no content there is probably a problem... Charles Regarding the excellent rate given by LIFT to pacareerlink.state.pa.us

USABLENET TECH SUPPORT W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Re LIFT [1] not following the javascript: There's a workaround for this particular page that gives more information. 
When you view the page in browser that has javascript it takes you to a new page (actually there's some cgi arguments after that but they can be omitted) If you put that url into LIFT, LIFT finds 4 major problems and gives it only a fair rating (and like I mentioned, the site is aware of these problems and is planning to fix them). 
Among the problems is missing alt text... we'd like that to cause the page to fail and indeed, as Paolo has already told us, it's possible to reconfigure LIFT to elevate to a catastropic level, which would make the page fail. 
LIFT also give other info... see the page for more details, and does it in a clean, easy to read layout. 
Still, someone using a browser that doesn't support javascript, e.g. lynx, wouldn't get this far, so for accessibility purposes it would be useful to put in checks for javascript. 
Of course this applies to all tools, not just LIFT. 
Handling Javascript is turning out to be a major challenge for all accessibility checking tools. 
There's another caveat that's already pointed out on the LIFT page: Please note that UsableNet online service is unable, as any other automated too, to check usability of the page in terms of its contents or its aesthetics value. 
From an accessibility perspective, this includes the fact that e.g. although lift can check if ALT text exists, it can't check if it's accurate. 
In general manual checking would be needed in addition to LIFT.
