Is there a comparison/equality operation in XQuery that allows me to decide if two strings are equal? 
Just to be clear, by "equal" I mean here really equal, i.e., without collation or anything like that.

You can use fn:compare using the Unicode codepoint collation. 
This will give you a "character by character" comparison.
