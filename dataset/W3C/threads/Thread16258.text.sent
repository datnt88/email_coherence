Hello all: I have an accessibility question about accessing the archives by some field (e.g. author, title, subject, thread). 
One example, I expected the linked text to be the author, so when I tab from link to link and land on the author I am interested in, a page is brought up with messages by that author when I hit the enter key. 
Instead, I hear "Re: ... " with no author in it at all. 
This is the subject (or thread, there's no way to determine that either). 
My guess is the author is some kind of visual heading but not a link. 
In effect, it is sorted by author only if you access it by sight but it is by subject when you access it by speech output using the tab key to move from link to link. 
Can this be changed to be more natural when using a screen reader? 
-Steve need for list of authors? 
I think Steve has a good point here. 
Possibly: We should have a page with just the authors names on, (and maybe the number of articles,) and a link to the archive of messages written by that author.

move from link to link. 
actually, I find the whole thing confusing. 
when I pick, thread for instance, I'd like to see just the threads and then just the thread I pick. 
same with subject, date, author and so on.

I am working with Jose Kahan of W3C on how our archives are presented, so if you have ideas about how to make them more accessible please follow up this thread.
