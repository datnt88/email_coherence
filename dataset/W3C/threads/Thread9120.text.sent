Hi, In the xmldsig-core or RFC3275, X509SerialNumber is defined as "integer" As I know, serialNumber in a certificate is a ASN1 "INTEGER", which may be a very large value, such as "123456789012345678901234567890", which can not assigned to a general "int" or "long" variable. 
In XML Schema specification, I do not find the evidence that a "integer" value can hold BIG INTEGER like the above example. 
So I think the type of X509SerialNuber may be "base64Binary". 
Am I right or wrong? 
Andrew The xsd:integer class has no range limits, and therefore matches the ASN.1 Integer /r$ Hi Andrew, Cited from [1]: 3.3.13 
integer [Definition:] integer is .derived. 
from decimal by fixing the value of .fractionDigits. to be 0. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the integer numbers. 
The .value space. 
of integer is the infinite set {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}. 
The .base type. 
of integer is decimal. 
I conclude from this definition that the schema type integer can be used to hold integers of arbitrary length.
