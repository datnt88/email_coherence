I would like to finish this today: Does anyone have or can point me to, a good definition for "script"?

Making e-Business Work Around the World Tex, Here is what the www.unicode.org 
glossary says: Script. 
A collection of symbols used to represent textual information in one or more writing systems. 
This is what we have on our microsoft www.Microsoft.com/globaldev 
web site: Script: A collection of characters for displaying written text, all of which have a common characteristic that justifies their consideration as a distinct set. 
One script can be used for several different languages (for example, Latin script, which covers all of Western Europe). 
Some written languages require multiple scripts (for example, Japanese, which requires at least three scripts-the hiragana and katakana syllabifies and the kanji ideographs imported from China). 
This sense of the word "script" has nothing to do with programming scripts such as Perl or Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript). 
And this is one from Nadine's book: Script A system of characters used to write one or several languages. 
Characters denote isolated sounds, syllables, or word elements and are governed by a general set of rules for creating text, such as default writing direction. 
Hope this helps.

Making e-Business Work Around the World Hello Russ, I think the Microsoft definition is a bit long, but much more self-contained than the others. 
The only change I would suggest is syllabifies - syllabaries. 
Regards, Martin. 
Martin, Thanks for the comments. 
Actually, what I thought would happen is that Tex could take the good from all of these definitions and then come up with one on his own.

thanks guys. 
I also asked on Qalam@yahoogroups.com and there was some discussion there. 
I will go with the Unicode definition as it is simplest and therefore is likely to require the least defense. 
;-) Please look at: I modified the rtl page to be multi-question to see what it looks like. 
The background and each subsection became answers to questions. 
The text didn't change, I just defined the question that each paragraph or section answered. 
I added the script definition. 
Over the long run, I would expect this page to collect more script and directionality related Q&amp;A (assuming the multi-question page style is adopted). 
The format makes it easy to add a short q&amp;a at any time with little overhead, and it is easy for users to see related topics and navigate thru them, and search engines will identify the topic with more precision and rank the page higher.
