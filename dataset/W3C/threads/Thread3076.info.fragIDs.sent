Hi, I checked out the latest cvs version of swap as described here: After downloading the tests from and running make I get the following output: 59/207 regression.n3#t1022 
Early DAML (now OWL) example in XML/RDF Files differ, result= 256 # If this is OK, cp ,temp/regression.n3_t1022.out

That would make the whole thing easier to understand. 
Or at least place a README in the directory there somewhere. 
Hi Henry, The problem you reported on 7 May was a case of the test data lagging a fix in the code. 
The test data was fixed in --- daml-ex.n3 6 Mar 2004 20:39:43 -0000 1.11 
the code was fixed a little earlier sax2rdf.py
