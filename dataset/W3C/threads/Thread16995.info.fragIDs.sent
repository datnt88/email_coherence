<s> Should W3C rename the WAI guidelines as standards?  </s>
<s> For example: Web Content Accessibility Standard (WCAS) Authoring Tools Accessibility Standard (ATAS) User Agent Accessibility Standard (UAAS)  </s>
<s> They will still be "officially" known as W3C Recommendations, but by putting the word standard into the title, it will tell the reader what they are intended to be - a standard, not a guideline.  </s>
<s> This may also help with fragmentation of the "guidelines".  </s>
<s> As we've probably all heard before: "They're only guidelines".  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that since W3C isn't an official standards-making body, nothing can be legitimately called a "standard"; it's a reserved word.  </s>
<s> However, "specification" should be available for use.  </s>
<s> I agree that the term "guideline" is problematic, because it carries an implication of "suggestion" which is not really what we are trying to accomplish nor is it in line with the way the "guidelines" are written.  </s>
<s> (If we are truly writing "guidelines" then WCAG 2.0 would look more like advice and less like requirements!) Anyway, I suspect this won't change, even if it really should.  </s>

<s> No. They are guidelines, not standards.  </s>
<s> A standard should be something against which you can unambiguously evaluate, and not at all like the WAI guidelines, parts of which are going to be matters of judgement with no definitive resolution.  </s>

<s> Actually, "standard" usually has a defined meaning, at least in my experience.  </s>
<s> Standards are meant to be implemented as written, and generally don't use the subjunctive case anywhere in them -- no "coulds", "woulds", "shoulds", etc.  </s>
<s> They don't have levels of implementation that are soft, or statements that certain things should be avoided if possible.  </s>
<s> For example, most internet protocols, the format of HTML, or the type of wood used in telephone poles, could be standards.  </s>
<s> Guidelines are different.  </s>
<s> Things that they publish don't contain words like "will" or "shall", but words like "may", "could", "should", or "would".  </s>
<s> Guidelines are used in places where the group knows that there's either no way to get everyone to agree on something, or where the guidelines will specify that something that is impossible be done.  </s>
<s> You can't generally refer to a guideline in a standard as a normative reference, because it is softer than a standard.  </s>
<s> Examples of guidelines include the WAI 1.0 guidelines as written today, at least in my opinion; example project plans published by ECIC; most documents that define usability/accessibility, etc. I'd say that there is room for both standards and guidelines in the world of WAI.  </s>
<s> Standards should be unbreakable and quantifiable, while guidelines are the place for the softer science, the places where things are in the AT of the beholders, as it were.  </s>
<s> Parenthetical note -- I've worked on standards before, inside T1M1.5, which is a standards group for telecom interfaces.  </s>
<s> There were defined formats and a process for getting the documents that we agreed on to ANSI, which would bless them as a national standard.  </s>
<s> For some documents, they would eventually work their way out to the ITU-T, which would publish them as an international standard.  </s>
<s> The solutions we came up to were always lowest-common-denominator, not ideal but the only things that everyone could agree on.  </s>
<s> Standards were usually tested before being voted on, using a variety of platforms, because they had to be implementable as written.  </s>
<s> I've also worked inside a guideline-group, the ECIC.  </s>
<s> Some of the exact same things were debated, but the solutions were usually better, as people discussed what the solution would be in an ideal world, then "weasel-worded" them to avoid committing anyone to actually follow the rules.  </s>
<s> Some of the things that people came up with were impossible to implement using current technology, but were used as a way to agree on what the ideal technology would be.  </s>
<s> In both cases, the attendees were often legally obligated to implement the things that we decided on.  </s>
<s> However, since the guidelines were worded softer, there was generally less force to them.  </s>
<s> It is much harder to show that someone has done something against a document, when all it says is "someone should do this" vs. "communications will work like this".  </s>
<s> Anyone can call anything a standard.  </s>
