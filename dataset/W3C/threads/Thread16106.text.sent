Robert, I am not the expert on CSS, but anyway... Do you have a background color specified for the body? 
If so then it should be inherited, which means the problem is not major, merely one of absolute completeness. 
I will ask the experts tomorrow. 
Regards Charles McCN Has anyone worked with the W3C CSS Validator much? 
I ran our code through and came up with so many "You have no background-color with your color". 
I thought this did not need to be specified? 
Pls remember, I am new to this validator, CSS and still learning it. 
Here is the results of the first pass.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Robert, IIRC, this is only a warning, indicating that you have specified a text colour without specifying a background colour. 
This is to remind you that not everyone uses the default background colours and that your elements may not be visible to some browsers. 
Make sure you specify a contrasting background colour.
