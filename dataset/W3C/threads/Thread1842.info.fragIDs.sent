<s> Hi , We are implementing a server for DeltaV , there are conflicts among couple of groups here about the design of the Server.  </s>
<s> One Group believes that since DeltaV is a versioning extension of WebDAV the relationship in terms of OOAD is "is Kind Of" (Inheritance) , hence the Implementation of DeltaV should extend from already implemented WebDAV server.  </s>
<s> While the other group believes that the DeltaV is a "Component" (not to be taken literally) of WebDAV i.e WebDAV can be made "versionable" using DeltaV or by simply "activating" DeltaV Implementation Code .... and hence DeltaV should be treated seperately.  </s>
<s> I would like to know the relationship between DeltaV and WebDAV in terms of OOP/OOAD.  </s>
<s> I would be highly grateful , if anyone could get back to me with his/her views as soon as possible.  </s>

<s> Vikram, In protocol design, generally we attempt to avoid specific OOP or OOAD models.  </s>
<s> It's up to the server implementor to decide how to implement a protocol, and they may not even be using an object-oriented programming language.  </s>
<s> Good luck resolving your conflicts!  </s>

<s> In OO terms, DeltaV and WebDAV are interface definitions, not implementations.  </s>
<s> DeltaV extends WebDAV both by introducing some new sub-interfaces of Resource (e.g. Activity and Version-History), but to make things interesting, for interoperability with existing clients, DeltaV also introduces some new *super-interfaces* that extend existing WebDAV classes (e.g. Resource and Collection) with new versioning methods.  </s>
<s> But you asked how an existing WebDAV server implementation should be extended to provide DeltaV support.  </s>
<s> That depends totally on how your existing WebDAV server is implemented, and to some extent, on what the implementation language is for your WebDAV server.  </s>
<s> So that leaves you with the very unsatisfying answer: "It depends" (:-).  </s>
