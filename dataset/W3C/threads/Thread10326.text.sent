now reflects the post-Beckett/PFPS/Carroll editing and all subsequent decisions. 
It has a slightly different look/feel (colors, table titles etc) , updated references (though if anyone has any complaints about any of those please feel free to correct me) and some more anchors and internal links. 
Ive made the text links slightly visible by messing with the background color, but if people don't like this its easy to tweak it in some other way. 
Text changes since the last version are in red. 
They include rewriting of the definition of 'merge', some minor rewordings to clarify meanings more carefully, and putting back the definition of 'vocabulary entailment' which had gotten lost somewhere (its now section 2.1 and has several links to it) and references to blank node *identifiers* in the statement of the rules (suggested by Dave). 
Also the dire warning about rdf:value (section 3.2.4) has been made less dire, also suggested by Dave. 
Significant changes are that XMLiteral values are stated explicitly to be distinct from character strings (defn of RDF interpretation, section 3), and the equivalence between plain literals and xsd:string typed literals is noted explicitly and an inference rule provided (end of section 7.4). 
The wording of the Lbase translation has been slightly altered to fit that last change also. 
The change list has been rewritten and is at the end. 
Pat PS. Peter, I believe this now addresses all your concerns.

On Mon, 28 Jul 2003 23:29:18 -0500 I've archived a copy of that at www-archive The unix diff of the words between that and the copy I reviewed at is also enclosed The changes look OK to me Dave Thank you Pat. 
I normally prefer to keep doc's in review stable, but at this stage, and with Pat highlighting recent changes in RED, I think its sensible to update in place. 
This gives Peter a stable place to look. 
I have therefore updated the editors draft linked from the home page.

Subject: semantics update Date: Mon, 28 Jul 2003 23:29:18 -0500 It may be that the changes do address all my concerns, I don't have time to check just now, and may not for at least a week. 
However, during the quick check I just made I found some remaining concerns. 
The first thing I checked was the list of post-last-call changes. 
I noticed that several changes that result in changes to RDF(S) entailments are not mentioned as substantial changes. 
The change making LV = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) means that ex:foo ex:rel "a" . 
rdfs-entails ex:foo ex:rel _:x . 
_:x rdf:type rdfs:Literal . 
whereas it does not in the last call semantics. 
This was pointed out in The change to datatyping in RDF makes many changes to D-entailments. 
In the last call semantics, there were few D-entailments, as there was no way to impose connections between typed literals and datatypes. 
For example, ex:foo ex:rel "1"^^xsd:decimal . 
did not xsd-entail ex:foo ex:rel "01"^^xsd:decimal . 
in the last call semantics because xsd-interpretations did not require that I(xsd:decimal) be the xsd:decimal datatype. 
The change requiring non-emtpy datatypes, although it technically does not affect any entailments, changes the permissable set of RDF datatypes, and thus forms a significant change to the RDF datatyping design. 
Without a comprehensive list of such changes, I do not view the RDF Semantics document as complete. 
Problems arise in the description of other changes. 
I can't imagine how the significant changes to the mapping to Lbase can be listed under ``The following changes do not effect [sic] the technical content.'' The change to lists doesn't affect any entailments that I can see. 
In fact, the it doesn't change anything at all with respect to the semantics, even the set of RDF graphs that are the result of RDF/XML parsing. 
The change to datatypes is not needed for compatability with OWL. 
It is instead needed because the last-call treatment of datatypes didn't work right. 
Peter F. Patel-Schneider Bell Labs Research Lucent Technologies PS: I also noticed a typo in 4.3 - Rdf - Rdfs I view both of these as ERRORS in the last call document which have now been fixed, in both cases in close consultation with you, for which I am grateful. 
So I am not sure what your point is here. 
Are you saying that you want us to revert to the situation in the LC doc? 
Do you , honestly now, think of this as a SIGNIFICANT change? 
Can you cite any example that has been seriously proposed of a datatype with empty domains? 
Again, I regard the omission of this condition simply as an editorial oversight: frankly, I never even thought about the possibility of an empty dataype until you pointed out that it was not explicitly prohibited and, if ever defined, would produce strange behavior in the semantics. 
So I prohibited it. 
Perhaps that could be better phrased. 
I should have said 'normative technical content' That is true, I should have listed that in the previous section. 
It was the need to support OWL identity reasoning which brought this to the fore, but OK. thanks. 
OK, the version at my URI now has the change list rephrased more in line with your remarks above (and the typo fixed). 
Textual changes marked in red; some of the material has been moved to other headings also. 
Apart from the typo, the main text is unaltered.

New text is now in shadow TR space (Pat - you didn't change the date so its hard to tell if I've actually got the right file) Verson 1.25 Brian From: pat hayes phayes@ihmc.us 
Subject: Re: semantics update Date: Wed, 30 Jul 2003 01:24:15 -0500 Of course not. 
However, I believe that they need to be documented as changes that could be seen by users. 
Again, this is a change to the specification that impacts its users. 
I believe that it thus needs to be documented as a change. 
I disagree even with this claim. 
Before the changes to datatypes, there were expected D-entailments that just didn't follow. 
Perhaps OWL depended more on these changes being made, but I would hope that the changes were made to fix the problems with D-entailments, not just to support OWL identity reasoning. 
peter Whoops, sorry. 
But if you used the same URI you must have, the old file no longer exists. 
Yup, looks good.
