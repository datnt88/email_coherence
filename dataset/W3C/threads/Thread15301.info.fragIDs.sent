Hi, in the italian web accessibility mailing list (webaccessibile@itlists.org) we are discussing about "Until user agents...." issues, that will be the "focus" of the future WCAG 1.0 Second Edition. 
But what is to remove? the text "Until user agents"? 
For eg: checkpoint 10.1 said: "Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause 
pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user. 
[Priority 2] " 
it will be: "do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user. 
[Priority 2]" and, at now, how we apply it? 
We need to not use the new windows and/or must inform the user about this fact? 
Thank to anyone that can take me this out from this blackhole :) 
Hi: I'm discussing with Roberto about this check point in webaccessibile mailing list. 
:) We need a clarifying. 
The fact is: why are we using here "Until user agents"? 
Does it mean that if 
user agents would allow user to turn off the popup, then the author can use 
the popup? 
That is what I understand, but I think it's wrong. 
We should move 
this check point from guideline 10, and reformulate it as "do not cause 
pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user" and put it perhaps in guideline 13? 
Or do I misunderstand the check point and the "until use agents" meaning? 
In that case, I need a rationale... ;-) Thanks, Maurizio Boscarol 
Hello, First Roberto Scano's question, "But what is to remove? the text 'Until user agents'? 
{10.1} will be: 'do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user. 
[Priority 2]'" We have discussed deprecating some of the checkpoints that have "until user agents" clauses in them. 
If a checkpoint is deprecated it is no longer required for conformance. 
For example, if we deprecate checkpoint 10.5 [0], authors no longer need to include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links. 
There are 13 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that use the "until user agents" clause. 
They are listed in (the soon-to-be-updated) "User Agent Support for Accessibility" [1]. 
We went through all 13 checkpoints in last week's techniques task force telecon [2, 3] and "assigned a number of action items to ourselves to test the current status of user agent implementation. 
Of these, we believe with various levels of strength that we can recommend deprecating 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5, but didn't initially think we could recommend deprecating the remainder. 
However, the testing may change our responses to all of the above." 
We hope that most of our test data will be found in the UAAG 1.0 test suite and implementation report. 
The task force will provide the WCAG WG with the results of the research so that we (the WCAG WG) can have an informed discussion about which checkpoints to deprecate and why.

Yes, that is what it means. 
Several browsers as well as browser helper 
applications allow users to control how and when pop-up windows appear (if at all). 
For example, in some browsers you can set pop-ups to appear either in the foreground or the background. 
You can also completely disable all pop-ups or only allow those that are the result of a user action. 
If we publish a revised WCAG 1.0, it will be to correct errors; not to make 
substantive changes. 
Your suggestion changes the meaning of the checkpoint 
by never allowing pop-ups or other windows to appear even if user agents allow users to turn them off - a substantive change to WCAG 1.0. 
Although the until user agents clauses have been difficult to interpret, they help clarify what should be the responsibility of the user agent versus that of the author (and the authoring tool). 
UAAG-conformant user agents (and ATAG-conformant authoring tools) are absolutely necessary to increase the pace at which the Web is becoming accessible. 
Until user agents clauses put pressure on the user agents and, in the future, allow the author to focus on providing the information that only the author can provide. 
In last week's techniques telecon discussion of checkpoint 10.1[4], the initial feeling is that we can not deprecate this checkpoint yet. 
Therefore, in essence, we are saying what you would like to see, but with the hope that someday user agents will handle new windows better (even better than they do today).

Best. 
Thank you, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative 
Thank you very much, Wendy, for your good explanation. 
if 
use 
Ok. 
make 
Ok. There were two positions in the discussion in the webaccessibile ML. 
One position were guessing that the check point wanted authors not to open popup windows at all. 
I wasn't originally thinking that, but the discussion made me doubtful. 
So we asked for. 
Now, if we do not mean popup avoided, as you explained, then the changes I proposed are not necessary. 
I think it's wrong to open popup windows in general, but after all I agree that it'also wrong to set an imperative rule about that because there may be cases where popup can be useful, if well handled by user agent. 
Anyway, wcag should only point out the problems for users when ua cannot handle them. 
Maybe a clarifying sentence or an example in the techniques can help someone having the same misunderstanding like the ones that were discussing in Italy. 
:) Something like stating the reverse issue: "I.e., if ua can handle popup windows, then the authors can use them if necessary, but be careful: popup can always be disorienting for some users". 
I thought that wasn't needed, but it seems like some foreign language people could benefit. 
Straight thinking. 
:) Thanks, best Maurizio Boscarol
