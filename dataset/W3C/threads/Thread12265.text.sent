For example, it fails for Priority 1 checkpoints 6.1 and 7.4. 
It was accessible to a screen reader, with exceptions noted.? Priority 1 checkpoints Checkpoint 1.1?Ensure that the author can produce accessible content in the markup language(s) supported by the tool. 
[Priority?1] 
Yes. 
Allows direct source editing, alternative content input options are available within dialog boxes (e.g. for ALT), some TABLE tags (THEAD, TBODY) must be manually entered, TABLE SUMMARY must be added manually. 
Allows author to turn off proprietary tags, and advanced technologies (DHTML, JavaScript).? Checkpoint 1.2?Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information during authoring, transformations, and conversions. 
[Priority?1] 
No. Conversion of table to text loses, header, caption, and summary information. 
When converting from a word-processor format to HTML, headings are transformed to plain text with font formatting. 
Must turn on "preserve existing HTML" or symbol insertion (?, ?, etc.) generate system font symbols, and if entered manually (&amp;eacute;) in HTML view they are converted back to system font symbols. 
Checkpoint 2.2?Ensure that the tool automatically generates valid markup. 
[Priority?1] 
Yes. 
Checkpoint 3.4?Do 
not automatically generate equivalent alternatives. 
Do not reuse previously authored alternatives without author confirmation, except when the function is known with certainty. 
[Priority?1] 
Yes. 
Checkpoint 6.1?Document all features that promote the production of accessible content. 
[Priority?1] 
No. None found in search of help file. 
Checkpoint 7.2?Allow the author to change the presentation within editing views without affecting the document markup. 
[Priority?1] 
Yes. 
In WYSIWYG (normal) view - can only use OS system tools to change default font-size and font-color. 
User is allowed to configure font-face. 
In HTML view user can control font-face and tag/attribute color. 
Using an Intellipoint mouse (wheel), user can change font size. 
Checkpoint 7.3?Allow the author to edit all properties of each element and object in an accessible fashion. 
[Priority?1] 
Yes. 
Checkpoint 7.4?Ensure that the editing view allows navigation via the structure of the document in an accessible fashion. 
[Priority?1] 
No. No outline view, no movement between like elements. 
Relative Priority checkpoints Note: These should be assessed by reference to the checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG10], and may be met at three different levels. 
Checkpoint 1.3?Ensure that when the tool automatically generates markup it conforms to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]. 
[Relative?Priority] 
?? No. When inserting images there is no prompt for alternative content (P1 in WCAG10). 
It does not include DOCTYPE at the beginning of your pages unless you manually build it in to the default page template (P2 in WCAG10). 
However, dependent upon the author's knowledge of accessibility requirements and abilities of the tool; it is capable of producing conforming content. 
Tools provide NOFRAMES placeholder and generic text . 
When inserting a plug-in (EMBED) dialog box has text entry field for alternative content. 
("Message for browsers without plug-in support"). 
Menu options are available to insert table CAPTION, THEAD, TBODY, and SUMMARY must be added manually. 
Manually looking at properties for IMG (after insertion) shows a text entry field for alternative content.

Checkpoint 1.4?Ensure that templates provided by the tool conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]. 
[Relative?Priority] 
? 
Yes. 
Generally, fairly good. 
Navigation generated by using Themes and Shared Borders include ALT for buttons. 
However, there is abundant use of font size rather than structural tags for headings. 
Form templates do not use LABEL.

Yes, when using JAWS 3.5. 
A few problems were noted. 
In WYSIWYG (normal view), default H1 and H2 text is not spoken (font size is too large for JAWS, this is a JAWS problem not FrontPage). 
With "view tags" on the UL and OL tags are not spoken. 
The tags for IMG and HR are not displayed.

I will post it shortly on the reviews page at were looking for such a review. 
A few clarification questions... 
It doesn't seem that you specified a level of conformance to the relative priority checkpoints. 
Was this intentional? 
You mention that it conforms to 7.1 and then go on to point out some major problems - it is not clear what priority the problems are for accessibility, and what level of conformance to the checkpoint you are claiming. 
cheers Charles McCN Apologies for the delay.

When people are doing conformance evaluations, it is a good thing to check and see if we have a developer contact - it may be helpful to run it past them for a week or so before sending it to the list if you are aftter further clarifications, and they seem to like it. 
Anyway, we have a few contacts for Frontpage, so I will pass it on to them (although Heather is probably going to beat me to it). 
Anyway, it is in the reviews page now, but not yet the others - I have had an off-and-on relationship with the Web in the last few days.
