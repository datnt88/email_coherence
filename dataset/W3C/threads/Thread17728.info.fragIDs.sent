<s> The draft Jon circulated 12 hours ago: Techniques: 1. Sequential keyboard access to explicit events associated with an element.  </s>
<s> [+P1][+Tnav-dhtml-sequential] 2. Direct keyboard access to explicit events associated with an element.  </s>
<s> [+P1][+Tnav-dhtml-direct] 3. Keyboard equivalents for simulating mouse explicit events.  </s>
<s> [+P1][+Tnav-dhtml-simulate] For reference to what we are discussing, the list of "on..." event attributes in HTML 4.0 are: onblur %Script; #IMPLIED -- the element lost the focus -- onfocus %Script; #IMPLIED -- the element got the focus -- onkeydown %Script; #IMPLIED -- a key was pressed down -- onkeypress %Script; #IMPLIED -- a key was pressed &amp; released -- onkeyup %Script; #IMPLIED -- a key was released -- ondblclick %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer button was double-clicked-- onmousedown %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer button was pressed down -- onmouseup %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer button was released -- onmousemove %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer was moved within -- onmouseout %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer was moved away -- onmouseover %Script; #IMPLIED -- a pointer was moved onto -- onselect %Script; #IMPLIED -- some text was selected -- onchange %Script; #IMPLIED -- the element value was changed -- onsubmit %Script; #IMPLIED -- the form was submitted -- onreset %Script; #IMPLIED -- the form was reset -- onload %Script; #IMPLIED -- the document has been loaded -- onunload %Script; #IMPLIED -- the document has been removed -- Many of the above apply to most all the element types.  </s>
<s> In a mouse-free environment I doubt that there is a 1:1 correspondence with the alternative mouse/cursor/focus/select mode of control.  </s>
<s> So, some keyboard sequence maps to the particular "on..." event.  </s>
<s> How is this conveyed to a UA, and to a user?  </s>
<s> It is unlikely that the same keyboard sequence (including various Ctrl/Shift/Alt concurrent keys) are appropriate for voice commands.  </s>
<s> Is it correct that the single script named in the CDATA of any of those %Script; must handle the variety of responders for the different media?  </s>
<s> If so, does some pre-processor have to map from the keyboard/voice command onto the proper "on..." attributes identifying the %Script; and supplying the same information (positional, and select/focus/blur) as if it came as a result of some prior or current mouse/select/keypress/etc. to process that request for action with the single specified %Script; .  </s>
<s> How does one substitute a different set of scripts?  </s>
<s> Can their names be indirect, so a user preference set of scripts can participate in determining which particular scripts are to be used/substituted for the specified one?  </s>
<s> Is it our job to anticipate how this mapping might be done?  </s>
<s> or only that a mapping is required?  </s>
<s> or that alternative, more appropriate %Script; might be substituted for the particular usage command set/presentation form?  </s>
<s> Questioning/Harvey  </s>
<s> Good questions.  </s>
<s> Here are some related thoughts.  </s>
<s> The 'onblur' and 'onfocus' events are not direct products of user manipulation of command devices.  </s>
<s> They are outputs of a state machine driven by these inputs.  </s>
<s> For example, TAB moves the focus from one element to another.  </s>
<s> The user keypress just says "move" and something in the document knows what to move to.  </s>
<s> I think that we will need to treat externally generated events differently from events which come out of such a state machine.  </s>
<s> The Archimedes project at Stanford offers a working example of an alternative command vocabulary used for voice.  </s>
<s> But all their voice commands are macros that talk to the shrink-wrapped software through the identical set of events it was expecting, and the shrink-wrapped software behaves just as it normally does.  </s>
<s> There is no concept of "replacing" part of the existing processing, just a pre-processor layer that expands a voice command into a set of mouse-and-keyboard emulation events.  </s>
<s> The present situation does not tell use enough about scripts to tell us what needs to be done to adapt them for different user capabilities and I/O devices.  </s>
<s> Chuck's example of the virtual image map script read the mouse coordinates to decide what to do; it did not simple respond to the clicking of the mouse button but that is what kicked it off.  </s>
<s> To be able to say what has to be done to adapt the behavior of a given script, one needs to know more about its behavior.  </s>
<s> At a minimum this means knowing what things it can change, and what information can influence how it changes those things.  </s>
<s> If a script fires on a mouse click and then reads the mouse coordinates to decide what to do, it is not enough to have the click event created by an alternative command device.  </s>
<s> To access the full range of behavior of the script, it is also necessary to arrange for the mouse coordinate information expected and read by the script to be controllable.  </s>
<s> Al to follow up on what Harvey Bingham said:  </s>
<s> More data, more souvenirs... Back when I was working on implementing the X Window and Motif toolkit, we had defined a level of event notification that would allow application to transparently support keyboard or mouse control in all widgets (i.e. UI WIndow obJECTS).  </s>
<s> If you take any good Motif programming book, you'll find definitions for things like osfCopy osfCut osfPaste osfClear osfEscape osfPageUp osfPageDown osfPageRight osfActivate osfMenuBar osfEndLine osfBeginLine osfSelect osfUndo osfCancel osfHelp osfSelectAll osfDeselectAll etc All these "virtual keysym", in our jargon, were meant to provide a layer of abstraction that permitted programs to stay independent of the device.  </s>
<s> In order to really be independent, the program "callbacks" had to follow some discipline and not dig into the guts of the real event that was behind this virtual notification.  </s>
<s> In retrospect, I think we should have made it impossible for the program API to access the real event details.  </s>
<s> Anyway, as Web pages involving DTHML are more and more ressembling the imperative coding practices of the past (vs. the declarative UI practives HTML FORM had introduced), this technology is likely to find a new use.  </s>
<s> I don't think we want to think about script substitution.  </s>
<s> We are mostly want to look at providing visibility to scripts and ways for the keyboard to emulate mouse based scripting events.  </s>
