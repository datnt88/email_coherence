Sigh. 
I got two of the URLs wrong. 
Here they all are again, with the report URLs fixed: Sorry about that!

Eve Eve, Why isn't a glist, which is meant to be used for a glossary, just a list of termdef elements? 
My problem is that I'd like to use termref to refer to terms defined in our glossary, but termref is supposed to be used along with termdef. 
And our glossary which is a glist doesn't contain any termdef, but gitems made of labels and defs. 
BTW, there is a typo in Table 6-1 [1], the example for termref uses termdef where you mean termref.

Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, DOM Activity Lead - This is a known bug that hasn't received any attention since the first release [1]. 
I'll take a look at this for the next version. 
Thanks for catching the doc bug.
