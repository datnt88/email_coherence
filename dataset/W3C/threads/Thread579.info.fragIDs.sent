<s> When tidying a document where there are links with name attributes which start with digits, Tidy adds an id attribute but doesn't warn about invalid values.  </s>

<s> Yes, but running Tidy on the same document after adding the id, current Tidy will warn about the invalid id attribute...  </s>
<s> So you suggest adding something like the following?  </s>
<s> if (name is no valid ID) ReportWarning "cannot add id attribute, invalid ID '1foo'" else add_id_to_element Should we warn about names that cannot be IDs in general?  </s>
<s> Agree. Whenever copying a name attribute to an id, it probably makes sense to validate the id value.  </s>
<s> Definitely for XHTML (or any XML), anyway.  </s>
