Hello Mark, For the Usage Scenario document, we want to make a reference to your JIT Localization document, and I have an action item to provide that. 
What version/location is the best to point to (most stable)? 
I have a) (or more exactly: 
on.html?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/html) 
b) a series of pages starting at Are there any others? 
Which one is best? 
Thanks and regards, Martin. 
The best version is (The public version IBM was taken from that, but it is not as good). 
BTW, if anyone has any feedback for improvement, that is always welcome. 
For reference, would it help if I submitted it as a Unicode Technical Note?

Hi Mark, I've added it as a reference in our usage scenarios document. 
The reference is in Section 3.2 (here http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/Overview.xml#id0x05db40e0) 
It would be helpful if it didn't say in red at the top "This is a rough draft, just to be used for informal discussions" and making it a UTN would make it a better reference.

It is not a feature.
