<s> I'm concerned about the idea of the IETF designing a protocol which completely punts on security issues.  </s>
<s> If this is a protocol with a port  </s>
<s> number, then it needs to explain how security is activated for that port.  </s>
<s> If it's just a layer, then it needs to explain how it's integrated into lower-level security services or explain the consequences of security attacks if a higher-level security service is used.  </s>
<s> Security tends to pervade all layers of all stacks in a truly secure system, so I'm dubious it can be punted as this charter proposes.  </s>
<s> I'm also uncomfortable with the idea of replicating all the flow-control machinery of TCP in a layer above it.  </s>
<s> The consequences of doing so should be documented and justified.  </s>
<s> - Chris  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I wasn't trying to suggest a complete punt.  </s>
<s> I was trying to say that the "heavy lifting" is done in other layers.  </s>
<s> The mux layer would naturally do what's necessary to enable effectively secured stacks to be built using both a mux layer and some security layer(s) (and that would naturally include the mux layer "not blowing it" on its own).  </s>
<s> Yeah, we heard some of this before IETF-43.  </s>
<s> You'll see documentation like you've suggested appearing in early drafts of the HTTP-NG charter.  </s>
<s> As we progressed on drafting the charter, we got to thinking it would be included in the MUX spec (as design rationale) rather than broken out into a separate document.  </s>
<s> To my surprise, this was not even raised at the HTTP-NG BOF, held under Transport aegis, at IETF-43; I took this to mean the community was getting comfortable with the arguments we were making on this point.  </s>
<s> Note also that we haven't proposed replicating all of TCP's flow control machinery.  </s>
<s> TCP's flow-control machinery includes both sender-side restraint (AKA slow-start) and reciever-given restraint (the windowing explicit on the wire).  </s>
<s> The mux needs the latter (at least for applications where you expect some real independence of the message streams), but not the former.  </s>
<s> The sender-side restraint is there to avoid flooding the network, and TCP will do that for us even with a mux above it.  </s>
<s> Note that the charter isn't explicit on this point.  </s>
<s> I anticipate the WG to debate this, and decide that the reciever-given restraint in the mux layer should be an optional module, because some applications will need it and some won't.  </s>
<s> I dont think that the authors of the charter truly intend to "punt all security".  </s>
<s> It seems to me that a reasonable MUX effort can get underway and provide good security.  </s>
<s> Obviously, the group needs to keep security considerations in mind and will have some serious work ahead of them beyond just the security issue.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see the group get started and discuss the issues going forward instead of objecting to the charter now.  </s>

<s> The excludes integrated security functions and is otherwise silent on the issue of security.  </s>
<s> Too many WGs have left security as an afterthought and had their output delayed months or years as a result.  </s>
<s> The charter has to at least say "the group will address security considerations of a MUX layer and how security services in other layers interact with the MUX layer".  </s>
<s> One function of a charter is to serve as an informal contract between the IETF and the WG.  </s>
<s> It needs to state up front things which the WG must do to fulfill its mission.  </s>
<s> Even if I don't formally object to the charter on these grounds, I'd expect the security ADs to do so if they're being vigilant.  </s>
<s> It might be  </s>

<s> Ok, Im in agreement then, I thought you were objecting more to the effort than the language of the charter.  </s>

<s> to debate this, and decide that the reciever-given restraint in the mux layer should be an optional module, because some applications will need it and some won't.  </s>
<s> If I was to be present at the debate (which I have no reason to think I would be), I'd make the argument that any kind of data transfer without receiver- given restraint is tantamount to a request for assisted suicide.  </s>
<s> An implication of muxing across TCP (I think) is that the receiver-given TCP window will be set by the mux layer, and depend solely on how fast the mux layer can put the data into queues at the layer "above"; blocking all mux channels because of one slow client will be unacceptable in many cases.  </s>
<s> However, losing data is also unacceptable in many cases, as is duplicating the loss recovery mechanisms in TCP; this means that one must never get into a state where the multiplex layer has to choose between throwing away data and refusing to pass data across *any* connection.  </s>
<s> Thus, the only case I can imagine where receiver-given restraint is not needed is where the higher layer protocol "guarantees" that there will never be a significant number of bytes passed between operations (for instance POP client-to-server without command streaming).  </s>
<s> However, this leaves a wide-open door to denial-of-service attacks (just send "LOGIN enormouslylongstringthatwillcertainlycauseabufferoverflow") and strange results from changed enviroments (streaming mode, for instance, where it makes perfect sense to send 500 LIST requests without waiting for the responses).  </s>
