OK, I've taken Chris Newman's hint and expanded a bit on security, and also Jim Whitehead's hint to clarify the nature of the goals document. 
You can view the latest draft at: 
What I don't find acceptable is wording akin to "security's not our problem" which is basically what this proposed charter says. 
Here an example of wording I would find acceptable: The MEMUX WG will not design new security services. 
The document will describe how MEMUX interacts with existing security services (such as 
IPsec, TLS and SASL) and what impact it will have on higher or 
lower-level security services. 
There are subtle issues which need to be dealt with: * If user authentication is done below the MEMUX layer, how will higher-level protocols "know" that? 
* If user authentication is done above the MEMUX layer, what damage can passive or active attacks at the MEMUX layer cause? 
* What impact will MEMUX have on firewalls when used to multiplex multiple services on the same port? 
Security most definitely is part of the problem.

I agree with Chris re security, but I have another concern or possibly 
a confusion. 
The draft is written very aggressively to assume TCP as the substrate; IMHO this is wrong. 
If a new transport protocol of the general flavour of T/TCP emerges, MEMUX must be able to use it. 
Another thing I would like to see is a clear goal of being independent of IPv4 v IPv6, and able to function in a dynamic address environment such as NAT. 
In fact this is key to success.

As for the first: how do higher layers ever "know" about authentication done in lower layers? 
This is an issue of software in the peers, not the protocol, right? 
What goes on the wire makes it clear (assuming the protocols above and below MEMUX were prepared to be separated at all --- which they would of course be if they're separate protocols); the issue is that an API for using MEMUX must enable authentication to pass through the MEMUX software layer appropriately. 
As this WG is not about designing the API, I figure that issue is out of scope. 
I think the other two issues are clearly in scope. 
Huh? The draft is written very aggressively in terms of a general statement about the services expected from the underlying layer, rather than identifying TCP as *the* underlying layer. 
I think that set of services is a "general flavour", and is delivered by T/TCP. 
I hadn't expected the protocol to carry any addresses, so I hadn't expected these kinds of issues to come up at all. 
Wouldn't you agree that it goes without saying that wherever addresses *do* appear in current IETF work, the demands of the currently underway evolutionary steps of the Internet must be taken into account? 
Well, I read it to imply TCP as the preferred transport. 
I agree; and I'm suggesting the charter needs to say so.

I think the first is also in scope, to the extent that your points above be noted as a "security consideration".
