<s> OK, I've taken Chris Newman's hint and expanded a bit on security, and also Jim Whitehead's hint to clarify the nature of the goals document.  </s>
<s> You can view the latest draft at:  </s>
<s> What I don't find acceptable is wording akin to "security's not our problem" which is basically what this proposed charter says.  </s>
<s> Here an example of wording I would find acceptable: The MEMUX WG will not design new security services.  </s>
<s> The document will describe how MEMUX interacts with existing security services (such as  </s>
<s> IPsec, TLS and SASL) and what impact it will have on higher or  </s>
<s> lower-level security services.  </s>
<s> There are subtle issues which need to be dealt with: * If user authentication is done below the MEMUX layer, how will higher-level protocols "know" that?  </s>
<s> * If user authentication is done above the MEMUX layer, what damage can passive or active attacks at the MEMUX layer cause?  </s>
<s> * What impact will MEMUX have on firewalls when used to multiplex multiple services on the same port?  </s>
<s> Security most definitely is part of the problem.  </s>
<s> - Chris  </s>
<s> I agree with Chris re security, but I have another concern or possibly  </s>
<s> a confusion.  </s>
<s> The draft is written very aggressively to assume TCP as the substrate; IMHO this is wrong.  </s>
<s> If a new transport protocol of the general flavour of T/TCP emerges, MEMUX must be able to use it.  </s>
<s> Another thing I would like to see is a clear goal of being independent of IPv4 v IPv6, and able to function in a dynamic address environment such as NAT.  </s>
<s> In fact this is key to success.  </s>

<s> As for the first: how do higher layers ever "know" about authentication done in lower layers?  </s>
<s> This is an issue of software in the peers, not the protocol, right?  </s>
<s> What goes on the wire makes it clear (assuming the protocols above and below MEMUX were prepared to be separated at all --- which they would of course be if they're separate protocols); the issue is that an API for using MEMUX must enable authentication to pass through the MEMUX software layer appropriately.  </s>
<s> As this WG is not about designing the API, I figure that issue is out of scope.  </s>
<s> I think the other two issues are clearly in scope.  </s>
<s> Huh? The draft is written very aggressively in terms of a general statement about the services expected from the underlying layer, rather than identifying TCP as *the* underlying layer.  </s>
<s> I think that set of services is a "general flavour", and is delivered by T/TCP.  </s>
<s> I hadn't expected the protocol to carry any addresses, so I hadn't expected these kinds of issues to come up at all.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't you agree that it goes without saying that wherever addresses *do* appear in current IETF work, the demands of the currently underway evolutionary steps of the Internet must be taken into account?  </s>
<s> Well, I read it to imply TCP as the preferred transport.  </s>
<s> I agree; and I'm suggesting the charter needs to say so.  </s>
