<s> This is more of a test case, but it has immediate consequences for the WebOnt and perhaps the RDF working group.  </s>
<s> ***CLAIM: If Strong (or pt restricted) Ontological Commitment is true, then there can be no OWL DL RDF/XML documents*, all the syntax checkers are broken, and a lot of OWL Test manifests assert falsehoods.  </s>
<s> *There may be some corner cases where the DL document doesn't use any of the OWL or RDF vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> :foo :bar "blargh".  </s>
<s> is an OWL DL  </s>
<s> document encodable in RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> So I'll change it to no "interesting" OWL DL RDF/XML document, where "interesting" means "using the rdf, rdf, or owl vocabularies.  </s>
<s> Actually, if you permit rdf entailment, it's true for all non-empty ones, I think.  </s>
<s> ***PROOF: Ontological Commitment requires (some form of) the imports closure of  </s>
<s> the used URIs in a document.  </s>
<s> The owl document consisting solely of: Thus requires *at least* the importing of "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl"  </s>
<s> Thus, *at least* contains: (see http://mindswap.org/~bparsia/ontologies/test/importowl.owl)  </s>
<s> This is in owl full due to redefinition of builtin vocabulary (bit more discussion: 0051.html).  </s>
<s> Q.E.D Ok, if you say, "Wait, owl:imports only has to have the *effect* of concatinating the graphs", well, you still, afaict, lose.  </s>
<s> I don't think the schema at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl is compatible with DL.  </s>
<s> At least the direct model theoretic semantics (in any straightforward way).  </s>
<s> So there's lots of ways to fix this, change the definition of owl:imports, change stuff about species tests, change the document served up at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl (and the rdf: and rdfs: ones, perhaps).  </s>
<s> I did think that some sort of RDDL document which said that the schema was "informative" and the spec "normative" might help.  </s>
<s> But who knows?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> Why argue against a position that noone has taken?  </s>
<s> What is "Strong Ontological Commitment"?  </s>
<s> If you want to argue against a position, do it in the words used to express the position, please.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Are you genuinely asking or indirectly suggesting I shouldn't?  </s>
<s> Because it's not clear that no one has taken it.  </s>
<s> Also, it was involved a non-obvious consequence of the position, one, I believe, may affect some of the weaker views propounded or suggested.  </s>
<s> So I laid out the argument so we could understand better what might be wrong with SOC.  </s>
<s> And if no one has taken it, what do you care that I chose to refute it?  </s>
<s> Perhaps I trying to build stronger consensus against it?  </s>
<s> See the talking points for today email.  </s>
<s> I reserve the right to write my email in this forum in the context of this forum.  </s>
<s> This got sent not long after an email where I defined the term.  </s>
<s> The OC view is: "that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology, and if there is doubt as to what ontology that is, the web may be used to  </s>
<s> resolve it."  </s>
<s> More precisely: "that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology" (The rest is irrelevant to the OC bit) The strong OC view (SOC) is the interpretation of that phrase where: The 'implies' means that using *is* committing.  </s>
<s> If I so use, I so commit.  </s>
<s> The 'commitment' means that you must treat all the statements of that ontology as true.  </s>
<s> The ontology in question is the one the URI owner made dereferencable (or otherwise available) I don't see much other likely readings, as I have argued.  </s>
<s> So long as the above text is "live" in a tag issue statement, I don't see arguing against it is either otiose or odious.  </s>
<s> This statement of the view, in my understanding, entails that an RDF document is consistent iff the imports closure over all the URIs used in that document is consistent.  </s>
<s> By RDF document being consistent, I mean that the a document of mimetype application/rdf+xml, conforms to the RDF specs, and that the RDF graph it is a serialization of is consistent.  </s>
<s> "imports closure", in my lexicon, is the graph merge of the graphs serialized as documents which are dereferencable from the URIs labeling nodes in those graphs.  </s>
<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> That didn't come out as clean as i wanted, but I *hope* we all understand that now.  </s>
<s> (Note that I'm not saying that you "half to do the imports closure by downloading and parsing".  </s>
<s> But it would seem that it'd pretty dang hard to correctly say you've determined the consistency of a document without doing that.) Have I met your terminological standards?  </s>
<s> And are you ok with me using SOC and OC (or their expansions) from now on without repeating this or referencing the archive?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> I don't see how this will make it clear.  </s>
<s> I don't.  </s>
<s> never mind.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I didn't say it would.  </s>
<s> But if someone held the view, the argument might convince them otherwise.  </s>
<s> It might help firm up consensus against the view (which hasn't been established, yet, except informally), and it might reveal other things.  </s>
<s> Or, what the heck, one persons modus pones is another's modus tollens.  </s>
<s> I really should start skipping to the end of messages before starting to reply.  </s>
<s> I just note the cost of queries like that.  </s>
<s> Also, you didn't reply to my response to request you made in the latter part of you message, especially wrt I have met your standard for terminological explication.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to figure out what counts as meeting your request, as, before your note, I though I was doing a very good job of keeping terms clear, and sources of views mentioned.  </s>
<s> I've quoted the text that is the source of the OSC view *serveral* times, and gave my derivation of the "imports closure" version of it twice.  </s>
<s> I would like, henceforth, to just use OSC in this forum.  </s>
<s> I think this complies with the spirit of your request, but you haven't confirmed that.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
