Hello, I think the WG should strengthen a statement in the guidelines that any important content inserted by a style sheet be available in the document source as well (rationale: device-independence, users can override styles, etc.) The line between content and style is blurred by some parts of CSS. 
Style sheets may cause numbers or words to be generated in the rendering structure, just as they can insert images. 
Most users will have a difficult time distinguishing the document tree from the rendering structure, and will have to read the style sheets to find out whether "1.2" was generated by styles (and therefore may be changed through styles) or inserted by hand. 
In the Techniques document of 5 May, we raise this issue obliquely: Text generated by style sheets is not part of the document source and will not be available to assistive technologies that access content through DOM, level 1 ([DOM1]). 
I think we need to make a stronger point. 
Here's an example. 
W3C Recommendations use a background image in the upper left hand corner to indicate on graphical browsers that that they are Recommendations. 
There is no alt text for this image since it's inserted by a style sheet (and CSS has no mechanism for specifying alt text. 
On the one hand, one can argue that if the information is being inserted by a style sheet it is only meant for style, not content, and therefore not alt text is necessary. 
On the other hand, people argue that one shouldn't put text in images but should use styles so that the text is accessible. 
Also, languages like SVG that create graphics will real text in them tout the accessibility benefits. 
Does the title of the document suffice to convey the document status?

No, but the hypertext of the document does. 
In the particular case of the connotations of being a W3C Recommendation, I would judge that the image bears no unique information but repeats what is in the hypertext. 
Note I say hypertext because the links back to discussions of document grades outside the current document is readily accessible via link following from the online presence of the Recommendation, which is its home form and its definitive form.

Does anyone know, what is the closest we could come in the Dublin Core to an attribute type of [authoring-organization-defined] status-or-mood? 
The notion of a W3C 'Recommendation' has connotations which involve a shared view as to the stability and efficacy of the technology articulated in the document. 
The stability and efficacy notions are software engineering generic notions. 
The collective opinion is a voting generic notion. 
The W3C is a unique organizational entity. 
But one could use generic logic language to form an assertion about shared believe state with regard to primitive notions imported from software engineering. 
There is a definite connotation of "people should use it" but the strict sense of the imperative mode has been softened [for reasons suppressed here].

Sorry about the welter of messages. 
The practical approach is to look at the inserted text, and ask what motivated its insertion. 
Then look for how that motivation is expressed in the base document. 
Frequently this may result in creating a better mnemonic CLASS indication which is used to trigger the style. 
That is the first thing to try when it appears that there is information in the stylesheet insertions which is not accessible from the core text. 
Even when all that the stylesheet is doing is applying color or font face, one needs to try to get out of one's eyeballs to see if the antecedents of the style affects are expressed in a communicative way.
