<s> Hello all, In the examples of contractions I have seen "o'clock", "isn't", etc. Can  </s>
<s> someone explain to me what accessibility problems are involved in those?  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> can't see much problems with those.  </s>
<s> Can someone give me examples of contractions that really limit accessibility?  </s>
<s> In our language, Dutch, we have some contractions that have been used  </s>
<s> instead of the full versions for decades, maybe even centuries.  </s>
<s> Examples: "  </s>
<s> 's morgens" instead of "des morgens", "zo'n" instead of "zo een".  </s>
<s> The full  </s>
<s> word 'des' has all but disappeared from our language, and won't be familiar  </s>
<s> to people with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> For these examples, most people won't even realize that they are  </s>
<s> contractions and might get confused and even not understand you if you  </s>
<s> provide the full version.  </s>
<s> In my estimate, this will be especially true for  </s>
<s> people with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> The contracted versions are the simple  </s>
<s> versions, providing the full archaic versions won't benefit anyone.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that there are contractions that would benefit from providing  </s>
<s> the full version for better understanding, and that there are contractions  </s>
<s> where providing the full version could be harmful.  </s>
<s> I don't know that we can  </s>
<s> come up with a clear definition to separate the two but we have to be careful not to do more harm than good.  </s>

<s> Hi Yvette, you raise a good point.  </s>
<s> I think the important thing is to be working on things that are not clear if people use a given vocabulary.  </s>
<s> In some languages and for many circumstances we could prpovide a reference vocabulary that effectively avoids ambiguity (one of the ways that people can find ambiguity is by having an abnormally large vocabulary, and understanding the little-known meanings of words as well as the more common ones.  </s>
<s> This is something that causes problems in language testing at primary school level...).  </s>
<s> The general principle, I think, is to clarify things that aren't in a reference vocabulary, that are ambiguous, metaphorical, sarcastic, or otherwise harder to interpret for people with one of the various disabilities that impact the understanding of language.  </s>
<s> As an example, expanding "o'clock" to "of the clock" is likely to be more  </s>
<s> harm than good, since "o'clock" would be the more common term.  </s>
<s> Similarly the  </s>
<s> examples you provide for dutch (I believe there are other languages that have  </s>
<s> a lot of these, but can't think of any now except "o'clock" and "most any" used in the US to mean "almost any" but which is really more of a significant regional language variation :( are cases where the short form would be in the more widely understood vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> Just a small plug Using a referenced lexicon would make all these type of problems go away....  </s>

<s> Yvette: Question: are the contractions you bring up here actually in the written version of Dutch, and used as acceptable contractions in written Dutch.  </s>
<s> Or is this more a spoken issue, as with Charles' example of "most any" instead of "almost any."  </s>
<s> I would posit that Charles' example is simply poor grammar, and if found on sites would be hard to regulate.  </s>
<s> Do grammar checkers catch such a thing?  </s>
<s> was not wasn't are both grammatical contractions.  </s>
<s> It just seems like we will need to differentiate between grammatical contractions and colloquialisms (which I would argue are not regulatable).  </s>
<s> -kerstin  </s>
<s> Hello Kerstin, The contractions I brought up are part of the normal Dutch language, both written and spoken.  </s>
<s> It's similar to "o'clock" in English.  </s>
<s> Nobody uses the full forms anymore, many people won't even know what the full forms are (especially people with a limited vocabulary).  </s>
<s> If I write in Dutch "such a boy goes to school in the morning" I will write "zo'n jongen gaat 's morgens naar school", even in the most formal writing I can think of.  </s>
<s> Because these contractions are part of the normal Dutch language, both spell checkers and grammar checkers will find them perfectly acceptable.  </s>
<s> The "zo een jongen gaat des morgens naar school" form also passes both spell checkers and grammar checkers but I think that is partly because grammar checkers for Dutch aren't as well developed as grammar checkers for English so they tend to miss a lot of errors.  </s>
<s> School teachers wouldn't allow the non-contracted forms since they are no longer part of our language (just like an English teacher wouldn't allow "he doth his homework" unless it's a Shakespearean essay).  </s>
<s> We can't require advanced linguistic knowledge from our authors, so I think we can't ask them to provide the full versions for grammatical contractions for which the full versions have either disappeared from the language or are rarely used.  </s>
<s> This means we need to make a distinction between different types of grammatical contractions.  </s>
<s> I'm still looking forward to some examples where contractions cause accessibility problems, by the way :-) Although I can imagine that there are cases where contractions can be confusing, I can't think of an example myself.  </s>
<s> If we want to include a success criteria about contractions, the least we can do is find a few examples that cause accessibility problems and discuss what the best way would be to solve them.  </s>
