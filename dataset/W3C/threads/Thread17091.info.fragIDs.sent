<s> 2. 508 says "...the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology."  </s>
<s> My interpretation of "functional text" is a bit hazy.  </s>
<s> I would expect that this standard requires that information provided or created by a script and the user interface controls used to manipulate the script, i.e. the input and output elements generated by the script, are in themselves accessible.  </s>

<s> Hi Anthony,  </s>
<s> In my understanding, Section 508 ?1194.22(l) and WCAG Checkpoint 6.3 are very different (compare http://www.jimthatcher.com/sidebyside.htm#508View and http://www.jimthatcher.com/webcoursea.htm).  </s>
<s> I interpret WCAG 6.3 to say that the page must work and carry all the same information when scripting is disabled.  </s>
<s> That means that scripting is relegated to things like attribute changes with mouse-Over and form verification that would happen on server side when scripting if off.  </s>
<s> Section 508, on the other hand, just requires that the results of scripts make sense to assistive technology.  </s>
<s> The simplest  </s>
<s> idea that is allowed by 508 and not by WCAG is simple writing (document.write)  </s>
<s> with JavaScript during page load, like for a ?Last updated?  </s>
<s> line.  </s>
<s> In the webcourse referenced above there are other examples.  </s>

<s> I get your point.  </s>
<s> What would an attorney do with the phrase "identified with functional text".  </s>
<s> Clearly, most list members would believe that the meaning of the rule is that any information generated by a script must be provided in a way that can be accessed by assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> In your example, this would be the actual bus schedule, not just words that say, "the bus schedule is below this text".  </s>
<s> However, I've heard a lot of nit-picking over language in WCAG and 508, and would be interested to hear what a lawyer would say about the meaning of this specific phrase of the rule.  </s>

<s> I agree that 508 and WCAG are different.  </s>
<s> 508 would seem to allow, according to the letter, text like "this applet is inaccessible" as an appropriate replacement, with the proviso that there is a system wihch meets 508's user agent requirements and which could have dealt with the script.  </s>
<s> WCAG requires that people can use the content without the script.  </s>
<s> It also requires that for people whose user agent can handle the technology, the onject is written so it is compatible with the user agent.  </s>
<s> As an example, it is possible in an interactive SVG image to include audio descriptions of the visual rendering, which can be triggered with voice commands.  </s>
<s> Under 508 it seems OK to simply have "you can't see this" provided to people without an accessible SVG viewer, so long as such a thing exists.  </s>
<s> Under WCAG 6.3 there needs to be some way to operate the functionality without an SVG viewer (although as Anthony said this seems counter to the spirit).  </s>
<s> It is also required by WCAG 8.1 that the SVG in question does have accessibility features used - it is not clear that this is required by 508 either.  </s>
<s> So I agree with David that the Section 508 requirements seem a little underspecified here in terms of ensuring actual accessibility to people.  </s>

<s> Based upon the overall Section 508 and Access Board comments, I believe your literal reading is incorrect.  </s>
<s> Specifically, I seem to recall an example where a script performs a login and the NOSCRIPT can't simple say "This is the login page" but has to provide the functionality (i.e., allow the user to actually login).  </s>
<s> In your example, where an accessible SVG viewer exists, my understanding is that the page needs to provide the URI to download the plugin and not simply say "sorry but you can't see this".  </s>
<s> That said, I agree with Phil's comment, "508 is more forward thinking and is focused on making JavaScript directly accessible."  </s>

<s> Hi Folks, I eventually concluded that the wording "functional text" in Rule L refers to the output of the script.  </s>
<s> In this respect, I think 508 L is closer to WCAG 8.1.  </s>
<s> However, that's my "eventual" interpretation and to a degree, I interpret it that way because I want the script to be accessible.  </s>
<s> My initial thinking was that the functional text was basically what Charles has described.  </s>
<s> The real problem here, is that the standard is not that clearly defined.  </s>
<s> It's open to interpretation.  </s>
<s> Sorry if this adds to the confusion but such is life.  </s>

<s> Both 508 and WCAG require accessbile Javascript - WCAG via checkpoint 8.1 whose value Phill claimed was nil.  </s>
<s> WCAG requires, in addition, a working fallback, for situations which arise in the world like "there is an accessible plugin in english, but the content of the page is in hebrew", or "the plugin which meets the 508 requirements unfortunqtely doesn't meet the requirements of a particular user".  </s>
