The November 14th draft is available in HTML, zipped PostScript, gzipped PostScript, zipped RTF, and gzipped RTF, at The HTML looks a little different - critiques on that welcome; since this will be the first form that many people will run across, it's worthwhile investing time in making it friendly. 
One specific question: all of the terms in the XML source are linked to a termdef ... /termdef phrase. 
HTML being what it is, I've just put a hot-link in to the beginning of the termdef. 
Can anyone think of a clever trick to mark the extent of these definitions without seriously impairing the readability of the HTML? 
Coming real soon now: SGML/XML version, as soon as we finish wrangling the Panorama stylesheet. 
If anyone else reading this can think of another delivery format I'd be happy to host it. 
I find the slight differences in flavor that you get in the different versions are very interesting. 
The RTF/PostScript certainly has immensely superior typographic values; on the other hand, the fact that all the terms and nonterminals and references in the HTML are hotlinks is a substantial value-add. 
If you're having trouble printing one of the RTF/PS versions, you can get something perfectly usable by bringing the HTML up in a browser, reducing the font size to the minimum, and printing there; I find that MSIE produces a slightly more elegant printout than Netscape, but your mileage may vary. 
For what it's worth, Michael and I are agreed, but the ERB hasn't yet considered the question, that the huge list of 10646 character roles should migrate into an appendix, with a pointer in the main text. 
Aside from being hideously ugly, it breaks up the flow [and also, things that are in the appendix don't count against XML's 20-page budget.] 
Does anyone have a reason not to do this? - Tim Good idea. 
I think that in general, the names of the major character classes is enough. 
Well done. 
Good idea. 
The Technical Corrigendum (TC) to SGML on Extended Naming Rules (ENR) looks like it has succeeded. 
If so, there is now a legit SGML declaration possible for defining all those extra name characters, if they are used. 
(EditTime editor already handles ENR/Unicode, if anyone is interested.) ENR TC is at http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg8/document/1896.htm 
By the way, if the XML data has been generated valid, am I right in thinking a non-validing XML parser is completely OK with the robust and simple lexical rule that a name is anything up to a delimiter or 's' (after entity references in (non-CDATA) attribute values have been resolved)? 
If so, that should be made clear in the 1.0 spec, since it drastically simplifies things for implementors. 
Also, I think the &amp;u form entities should just have the "u" prefix, not the "u-" prefix. 
I don't think it adds anything, and, potentially add thousands of characters to any entity declarations.
