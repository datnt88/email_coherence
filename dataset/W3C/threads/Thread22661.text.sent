Hallo... 
I'm doing a University Project and I'm begin to study about DOM. 
I'd like to know: - how can i get DOM, it has aready been installed in my computer (I've IE 5.0)? 
If it's not, how can i install DOM? 
If it's aready installed, i've to have some software or make some configurations do use that? 
Or i can use normally? 
- About Levels of DOM: These Levels - level 1, level 2 and level 3 - are just to separate the definitions of DOM, or it's to be installed, or something like that? 
Please, these are simple difficulties, but if i don't discover these things it'll be hard to improve in my Project. 
Thank you. 
First, please note that the DOM is no software but a concept, you cannot install it. 
You have to use an implementation of the DOM. 
They denote different Levels of the DOM.

See also http://www.w3.org/DOM/Activity and for those who have a DOM Level 2 or DOM Level 1 user agents, they will be able to see some demos in the pages. 
For the others, well, they can read the ECMAScript code... Philippe
