<s> ."  </s>
<s> This needs to be clarified, in my view.  </s>
<s> Here's a candidate redraft of the relevant bits:  </s>
<s> 4.3 XML allows character or general entity references in two places, namely in Element content ([39]) or Quoted character data ([16]).  </s>
<s> The names of external binary entities may also appear as/in the value of an ENTITY or ENTITIES attribute.  </s>
<s> On encountering one of these references, an XML processor shall: 2. For both character and entity references, the processor must not pass the reference itself to the application.  </s>
<s> 3. For character references, the processor must pass the indicated ISO 10646 bit pattern to the application in place of the reference.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> For an internal (text) entity, the processor should process the defined content of the reference on the same basis (i.e. as content or QuotedCData) that licensed the reference in the first place, with due regard to section 2.1 above, and pass the result to the application in place of the reference, EXCEPT that the content of references processed as QuotedCData MAY include single or double quotes ad lib., or may consist of a single '&amp;' character.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the content of references processed as 'content' MAY consist of either a single ' ' character or a single '&amp;' character.  </s>
<s> If the processor includes an external text entity under clauses (7) or (8) above, the results shall be as for internal (text) entities as defined in (6).  </s>
<s> XML allows parameter entity references in three places, namely in literals ([15]), the internal declaration subset ([33]) or the key of a conditional section ([58]).  </s>
<s> Processing in this case is parallel to that for internal (text) entities as defined in clause (6) above, with the obvious extension to allow content consisting of a single '%' character.  </s>
<s> Note the use of the label 'content' for production [39] is extremely infelicitous.  </s>
<s> The bit about parameter entity references is important, as it makes clear that the following is valid XML (as it is SGML): !doctype foo [ %yy; ] a &amp;g; b [nsgml says: (FOO -a f b )FOO C  </s>

<s> I think ' ' is forbidden in attribute values and thus is correctly included in the negated character class.  </s>
<s> As various people have pointed out, literal ampersands should also be prohibited, so the rule should be something like QuotedCData ::= '"' ([^" &amp;] | Reference)* '"'  </s>
<s> If we want the regular expressions to be formally unambiguous, I think you're right.  </s>
<s> And I think we do want them to be unambiguous, since regexp routines vary so much in how they resolve ambiguity (greedy and not greedy, earliest match vs. longest match, etc.) -- but it does make for some ugly expressions.  </s>
<s> Tim has discovered, in some treatment of re, a subtraction operator that means "all but", so we could write comment ::= ' !--*' ((.*) - '*-- ') '*-- ' I've never seen this operator, but it certainly helps a lot here.  </s>
<s> Of course, the implementors will translate it wrong when they / we translate this into RE tools lacking the subtraction operator, but that's better than having errors enshrined in the spec.  </s>
<s> (And a natural translation into lex will work nicely:  </s>
<s> !--*" { BEGIN(COM); }  </s>
<s> COM .  </s>
<s> ; COM "*-- " { BEGIN(INIT); } As long as the subtraction is longer than the default rule, lex will do the Right Thing.  </s>
<s> Yes. I repeat my plea for suggestions for the best way to discuss the handling of PE references.  </s>
<s> I see the following possibilities: A add prose describing how they are handled B add PERef and EE to the grammar, with prose describing the rules governing PE contents within declarations, while retaining the PEReference rule for describing the constraints on PE references between declarations  </s>
<s> C Add PEReference and EE to the white space tokens for the rules  </s>
<s> defining declarations, and continue to use PEReference -- but add EE -- in the rules defining the internal subset, and describe the relevant rules in prose (i.e. do it just the way 8879 does) D provide a wholly distinct grammar for the entity structure of declarations and the two subsets -- with prose describing what we are trying to convey Any way we cut this, we are looking at serious amounts of normative prose; the rules governing PE references just do not fit neatly into context-free grammars as I know how to write them.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, possibilities B and D would allow us to put more of the rules into the grammar and have less to describe in the prose.  </s>
<s> But D is at best very eccentric, and B will puzzle some readers who will not see why there are two productions for PE references.  </s>
<s> I repeat: does anybody have a good idea?  </s>
<s> Good point; at least an example would be useful.  </s>
<s> Thanks; I'll have to look at this on paper to have a rational reaction.  </s>
<s> Tim and I will be working on this this afternoon and can look at it together then.  </s>
<s> At the risk of appearing extremely dim: why?  </s>
<s> N.B. the term 'element content' has a special meaning in 8879 and does not mean 'content of an element' there, so using the term 'element content' for production 39 will confuse those familiar with SGML; the Validity Constraint called 'Element Content' is badly named from this point of view.  </s>
<s> It does; many thanks.  </s>

<s> Now I need to check carefully when NXP resolves (is supposed to resolve) entity references) 3.) !entity % yy '&amp;#37;zz' -- !entity % yy '&amp;#37;zz;' (Note the semicolon after zz !) After these changes I got the same results.  </s>
