Brian would you please walk me through what I am meant to do. 
Dan has made a comment on my text, you have assigned a number to it: and given it a name "goofy literals". 
I want to have a short discussion with Dan about this before the telecon on Friday when I take it we will discuss it. 
So I send a message to Dan and to www-rdf-comments The text of the message I wish to send is at the end of this message. 
What should the subject be "[danc-02] goofy literals"? 
Let's suppose that Dan then replies, "I missed that, yes that's fine then." 
Do I then reply saying "OK we will formally close this issue.", with a subject line of "[closed][danc-02] goofy literals"? 
On the other danc-01 issue I need to have a longer discussion with him to make sure that we are on the same page, so I can correctly present his issue to the WG (Dan even if you will be there, I am trying to iron out the process, also for comments from non-WG members). 
I assume I can generalize from the answers to this message. 
Jeremy Proposed response (not for WG discussion - that comes later). 
Hi Dan thanks for your comment on goofy literals. 
It has been assigned a URL Before the Working Group discusses this comment I wanted to check that you had seen the line in that subsection: The lexical form is present in all RDF literals; the language identifier and the datatype URI may be absent from an RDF literal. 
and find that insufficient. 
I take it that the text you would prefer is: A literal in an RDF graph containing up to three components called: + The lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal Form C [NFC] (required). 
+ The language identifier as defined by [RFC-3066], normalized to lowercase (optional). 
+ The datatype URI being an RDF URI reference (optional). 
A plain literal is one in which the datatype URI is absent. 
A typed literal is one in which the datatype URI is present. 
Have I understood correctly, or could we just leave it as it is? 
Jeremy I'm figuring this out as we go along. 
I'm wondering if I did that too quickly. 
I'm planning to try to update the comment tracking doc once at the beginning and once at the end of each working day. 
I could wait for the editors to request an id, but if I'd done that Peter might still be waiting, so I've been using my judgement, which may save the editors a small amount of work. 
This may mean I allocate an id to a comment that is soon withdrawn. 
I regard that as my bad luck. 
Good plan. 
I'd suggest you just reply to the message I sent allocating the id. 
That keeps the related messages together in the thread and you'll inherit the title of the thread - which now includes the comment id. 
Having the reference in the subject is good. 
See above. 
"[closed]" is good. 
I'd call this withdrawing the comment rather than closing it in the text. 
Same as above. 
Reply in thread if possible. 
The idea is to clarify the issue. 
In general its good practice to reflect all raised issues back in the editor's own words to check understanding. 
That bit is a bit redundant, given my previous response. 
Looks excellent. 
If Dan remains dissatisfied with the status quo, then you can bring proposed text to the WG Friday. 
Brian Gee... I would hope this is a simple editorial tweak, not the sort of thing where the WG need be involved. 
Nobody has to change any test cases or code over this; it's just a matter of how the text is written. 
It's fine to be conservative about these things, but if it were me, this wouldn't warrant an issue.

My bad. 
I don't have a good feeling for where to draw the line between editors discretion and what should be brought back the WG. 
Is that a good rule of thumb; If it is just a matter of clarifying the text to better express the intent of the WG, then editors have discretion? 
Fine by me. 
Sounds like I was being too heavy handed. 
Brian Or maybe you do... danc-01 might turn out to be more significant than I thought at first... 
You certainly didn't do anything bad... 
That's a rule of thumb I use, yes. 
But you/we should also consider that a spec could be technically/formally correct but so confusing as to hamper deployment of the technology... or that a commentor who could potentially cause wide deployment of the spec might get discouraged by dismissal of their comments as "merely editorial." 
Maybe, maybe not.

But Dan what should *I* do with this guy giving me grief over on rdf-comments! 
He's picking holes in my exact choice of words - I am pretty sure he knows what they mean; well, at least good enough - but probe anything deep enough and you can hit some philosphical problems. 
I really just don't want to have to think about it anymore, and get back to the serious stuff over in webont! 
How do I get rid of him? 
How much am I allowed to offend him? 
I think he goes by the name of connolly. 
More seriously, I am glad these two are on the last call issue list. 
So - this connolly fellow does not like my exact choice of words for defining RDF literals, nor the way I have defined graphs, and graph equality. 
On the first one I think he could accept the words that we've got, although not very happily - what he really wants (untyped literals without a language really, really are Unicode strings) he can't have (Unicode strings in RDF Graphs are URIrefs !?). 
My fear is that we could tweak the words one way or another, but it won't actually improve anything. 
The fact is that, particularly with XSD in the soup, there are interesting questions we can't answer. 
e.g. is "1"^^xsd:int the same as "0" when read as a sequence of integers (XML Schema user type derived by list). 
Thats what I learnt for my sins 0 = empty-set n+1 = n union { n } Any system that did this, would have a formally defensible position and not very many users. 
I do think we've gone far enough this round of rdf core spec writing, in terms of getting the formalisms clear, and nailing everything down. 
connolly seems to want us to go further; there's probably a postponable issue lurking in here. 
Jeremy Brian-- I'd like some further input on the last-call comment process regarding further mods to the Primer. 
Specifically, I had some comments from Dave and Jan (and one from you) on the LCC version that have not yet been made (generally editorial in nature, but need to be done, like using appropriate "example.org" 
URIs). 
Also synching the references (are we going to use "Manola F" or "F. Manola", for example). 
Can I go ahead and make those changes? 
I also had a whole set of comments from PPS, some of which I haven't dealt with yet. 
Can I go ahead and make the fixes that seem "editorial" without further WG input? 
Others seem more substantial (but I haven't heard back from him on them); *those* I may want to "escalate". 
Comments? 
--Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Fine, as long as there's a record, so that in case a member of the WG disagrees about whether it's editorial discretion, someone can speak up... Perhaps include such things as "issues" but differentiate between editorial and WG issues -- and telecon aggendas only address issues identified as WG issues, but the others are documented/managed in the same place, in case what is thought to be a simple clarification actually changes something non-trivial. 
New issues would be unclassified until the chair and editors agree on whether they are editorial or WG issues. 
Eh? Patrick
