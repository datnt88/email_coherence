<s> I'm trying, with mixed success, to skim this while also following the discussion here at the schema f2f.  </s>
<s> I'm still trying to grok the overall flow of what's changed, but for the most part it looks good.  </s>
<s> One thing did stand out as a significant concern.  </s>
<s> I note that the following text has been deleted: Applications SHOULD use "GET" as the value of webmeth:Method in conjunction with the 6.3 SOAP Response Message Exchange Pattern to support information retrievals which are safe, and for which no parameters other than a URI are required; i.e. when performing retrievals which are idempotent, known to be free of side effects, for which no SOAP request headers are required, and for which security considerations do not conflict with the possibility that cached results would be used.  </s>
<s> Except in unusual circumstances, other operations SHOULD be performed using "POST" in conjunction with the 6.2 SOAP Request-Response Message Exchange Pattern.  </s>
<s> Other methods SHOULD not in general be used.  </s>
<s> For example, use of "PUT" would suggest storing the SOAP envelope Infoset as the created resource, as opposed to processing in the manner required by the SOAP processing model (see [SOAP Part 1], section SOAP Processing Model.  </s>
<s> Was this change made as part of these edits.  </s>
<s> If so, I have a concern for several reasons (and if not I apologize for raising this in this thread):  </s>
<s> * This section is significant in discussing the concept of "safe retrievals"; I don't think we should lose it.  </s>
<s> * This was an important part of our negotiated agreement with the TAG.  </s>
<s> If I were them, I would be concerned to see this change without warning.  </s>
<s> * I think it is way beyond editorial, and well beyond our remit to restructure the bindings.  </s>
<s> So, reasonably strong plea to put this back the way it was.  </s>

<s> I think that para was deleted and replaced with the one directly following it as part of a prior change.  </s>
<s> The following (new) paragraph talks about this too so I'm not sure we lost anything.  </s>
<s> I expect the change was part of another issue resolution so I don;t think we should just put it back without check why it was changed in the first place - anyone want to 'fess up ?  </s>
