<s> Subject: RE: 506 definition of structure Gregg asks: "If text is structure what is information?"  </s>
<s> John responds: It depends (what did you think I'd say?  </s>
<s> grin ) And it depends in part on what level of abstraction you're talking about.  </s>
<s> What humans perceive as "information" doesn't exist in the abstract: it is embodied in some form, some medium.  </s>
<s> Information may exist in the form of text; it may exist in the form of graphics; it may be embodied in a mathetmatical equation, a chemical formula, an animation generated by a simulation, a video, etc.  </s>
<s> If a given human already knows the material in question, she or he doesn't perceive it as information, though it may count as information to the person sitting at the next desk.  </s>
<s> Information *has* structure, and structure is information.  </s>
<s> In our context, the markup that create structure is information about the shape of the information that a given document makes available.  </s>
<s> Gregory Bateson says information is news of difference that makes a difference.  </s>
<s> From this standpoint, a chameleon is always trying *not* to become information-- it wants (biologically speaking) to be indistinguishable from surrounding context.  </s>
<s> If the context changes faster than the chameleon's skin can respond, it becomes information, and instantly vulnerable to predators to whom the difference makes a difference.  </s>
<s> The self-organizing behavior of complex adaptive systems (like humans or the Web) depends on a given system's ability to convert what information theory would call "noise" (meaningless stuff coming in from outside) into information *about the system itself*; the system then uses that information to reorganize itself at a higher level of complexity.  </s>
<s> The Web was exactly such a phenomenon to the whole IT industry, and new technologies for producing and rendering Web content force the same kinds of reorganization-- hence our current effort to rewrite the accessibility guidelines at a higher level of complexity that takes account of all the technologies that are now used to produce Web content.  </s>
<s> Our guidelines will beomce another rock in the pond, etc, etc.  </s>
<s> But the proposed definition doesn't say "text *is* structure."  </s>
<s> It says that text is one of the types of material that may be included in a Web resource.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, though, for all Web resources that have source documents that employ markup languages (HTML, XML, SVG, etc.), it might be literally correct to say "Text is structure" because everything in the source document *is* text.  </s>
<s> And if you go farther down the ladder of abstraction even complex graphics and multimedia materials that are merely *referred* to in the source document reduce to strings of ones and zeroes, which can be represented in textual form.  </s>
<s> So it's text all the way down, or almost all the way down.  </s>

<s> The goal of 1.3, as I understand it, is to ensure that all the parts of the resource, including information about the way the resource is organized and the things that the resource may do (its functionality), are available to the user even when the way that resource looks or sounds changes.  </s>
<s> The changes might be caused by a user substituting his or her style sheet for the author's, or by switching to an alternate style sheet supplied by the author, or by using a user agent the author had never heard of...  </s>
