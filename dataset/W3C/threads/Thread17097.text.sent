Hi, I am developing a site using XHTML and CSS that degrades gracefully to a linear format for older browsers and text readers. 
Users with their own stylesheets should be able to override the site colours and font sizes without any problems. 
The problem we have is that the client wants the content to be centred on the page with some fixed width columns - if you try to increase the font size in the browser some of the content ends up overlapping from one column to the one beside it. 
It only happens with the menu column down the left hand side when there are long words in the menu. 
I can get around this by providing a 'text only' style link on the page so that users with problems can get the linear version. 
Ideally I should try to persuade the client to move to more flexible columns, but I have failed so far. 
What would you suggest the best way to go with this is? 
I would appreciate your feedback. 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker I would not use nor call it a text only page. 
I would if the client insists charge extra for the required duplication and code the page so that it works correctly and link to it with an accessible page link if need be and leave the other the way the client wants it to be. 
In this way, everyone gets the full functionality of the page. 
an accessibility problem?

Cheers, Julian Voelcker Hi David, OK, so you are suggesting doing the two versions, but rather than use a 'Text Only' link call it something like 'Accessibility version'. 
What's the best wording for it? 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker That's a good question, the main thing though is that it is not a text only page for two reasons at least. 
one is that it separates us out as is mentioned in another message and the other is that text only is not too accessible. 
call it the universal link or the alternate link. 
I'm not sure what to call it. 
It is certainly not non graphical some call them low bandwidth but only if that is the case. 
how about wcag compliant version link? 
around an accessibility problem?

insists works the Cheers, Julian Voelcker Hi David, Thanks for the further comments. 
I could use 'wcag compliant', but doubt that many people will know what it means. 
I think that I might just call the link 'full screen', 'flexible layout' or something along those lines and get the link to change the styles so that the layout is a flexible full width design. 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker Thanks, that is wahat I was aiming at.
