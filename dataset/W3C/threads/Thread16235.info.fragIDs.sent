<s> Not sure if this would be for you, but I have a few minor content comments.  </s>
<s> On the 'How to Print' page (http://www.rideuta.com/schedules/print.htm) The "Click" (or "Click here") assumes the user is using a pointing tool -- suggestion: "Select" or "Go to" The directions for printing are not very clear and would be different between browsers.  </s>
<s> The direction listed are right on for Netscape but with Internet Explorer the user would go to 'File' then to 'Print...' in order to get the dialog box to change the page orientation.  </s>

<s> Another one (still on the noshock version): For people who are tabbing through links, the fewer they have to tab through the better.  </s>
<s> So rather than have images, and then a seperate row of text links that say the same, try using a single row of links, each of which has both the image and the text in it (here you might think about different alt text, such as "link: " Then you get (in a text browser or screenreader) link: different stuff as the text for the link.  </s>

<s> We did some work with a development company that told us that their site was bobby approved.  </s>

<s> A blank screen with the name of the company at the top.  </s>
<s> My point is that bobby can only test what it can see.  </s>

<s> Philip, I may not be fair to say that Bobby was sleeping on the job.  </s>
<s> Phil Jenkins covered most of the issues in his response to the original email.  </s>
<s> I do want to mention three things: 1. Bobby is not perfect.  </s>
<s> 2. CAST requires that the page author conduct a number of manual checks.  </s>
<s> They do not always comply and we do notify sites when we are alerted of a problem.  </s>
<s> 3. We note that the growing Bobby Approved database (currently at 921) available at is not monitored and we hope that those who use it will notify Webmasters or developers who enter sites that have not passed both the electronic and manual checks for WAI priority one conformance.  </s>
<s> Many thousands of sites are tested with Bobby.  </s>
<s> Some use the icon but many do not.  </s>
<s> Of the thousands that do, CAST does not have the resources to police compliance so we depend on you to help identify and perhaps even notify those who use the icon improperly.  </s>
<s> By the way, we do have someone who scans the database sites for material that we feel may not be appropriate for all viewing audiences and have removed quite a few from the list.  </s>
<s> Finally, we do welcome your comments and strive to continuously improve Bobby.  </s>
