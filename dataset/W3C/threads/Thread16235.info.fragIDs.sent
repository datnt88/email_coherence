I have designed my site to meet with the Bobby approval. 
I have been an avid 
voyeur of your conversations over the past year and recognize that my site 
may not be as good as I hope. 
Please spend some time around our site and 
offer any comments to me at: lbrockbank@uta.cog.ut.us 
The URL is www.rideuta.com. 
I strongly believe in the importance of designing information that is accessible by all. 
I hope to eventually see more transit agencies hop on 
board.

Thomas is right - problem one is that there are users who are completely excluded (like me, when I first tried to get to the site - I don't have javascript on Lynx). 
A couple of comments about the content inside the site: Grouping things in red by using a font element instead of either a class, or div/table grouping markup, violates checkpoints of WCAG. 
Although it is not trivial to do, it is not very complex to to provide an interface through a database system that allows the user to customise the presentation - a sort of wizard-based stylesheet generator can apply ACSS, colours, different fonts, or whatever. 
Since you use cookies it is not hard to track that and provide an approproiate stylesheet link. 
The tables that specify the actual times should be laid out horizontally insted of vertically - that way the reader gets Stop x 9am 10am 11am 12.15pm stop y 9.02 10.02 11.15 1pm read out instead of stop x stop y stop z 9am 902am 905am 10am 1002am 1011am 1100am 1110am 1115am 12am 1209am etc. 
Alternatively, you could provide a link to the tablin service at linearise tables yourself - http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/tablin (Note that thesee comments apply to the noshock version - I ahve not looked at the other yet.

Hi Leslie, I visited rideuta.com using pwWebSpeak32 last night and greeted with a blank page. 
I guess Bobby was sleeping on this job. 
I suggest you take a look at this Center - Special Needs Systems, recommended it to me on Monday and I found it very informative. 
Thanks Phil. 
Take a look at my site located at enhancements or updates since I discovered WAI but pwWebSpeak32 is still able to read about 80%. 
of each page. 
I am happy to see you and the UTA are taking the initiative to be PWD friendly not only in the real world but also in cyber world. 
Keep up the good work. 
I know you will improve your PWD friendly web authoring skills.

Not sure if this would be for you, but I have a few minor content comments. 
On the 'How to Print' page (http://www.rideuta.com/schedules/print.htm) The "Click" (or "Click here") assumes the user is using a pointing tool -- suggestion: "Select" or "Go to" The directions for printing are not very clear and would be different between browsers. 
The direction listed are right on for Netscape but with Internet Explorer the user would go to 'File' then to 'Print...' in order to get the dialog box to change the page orientation. 
Wendee Thomas is right - problem one is that there are users who are completely excluded (like me, when I first tried to get to the site - I don't have javascript on Lynx).

Another one (still on the noshock version): For people who are tabbing through links, the fewer they have to tab through the better. 
So rather than have images, and then a seperate row of text links that say the same, try using a single row of links, each of which has both the image and the text in it (here you might think about different alt text, such as "link: " Then you get (in a text browser or screenreader) link: different stuff as the text for the link. 
(or you could have alt="") Charles McCN 
Bobby is good for what it is. 
It will, however, approve a completely useless Flash site.

Pardon Me. 
It was no reflection on your site. 
I was thinking of some others. 
We did some work with a development company that told us that their site was bobby approved. 
So I opened it with lynx and it looked like a Yoko Ono painting. 
A blank screen with the name of the company at the top. 
My point is that bobby can only test what it can see. 
It saw nothing on the afore mentioned site so it saw nothing wrong. 
So are you saying I have a "completely useless flash site?" 
If so, thank you for the time in providing me the feedback, it was very helpful.

Hi Leslie, One suggestion I have is to make the home page (index.htm or start page for the site) mostly text with no Flash or Shockwave. 
This will allow PWD to be able to get their bearings of the site. 
Form there you can link to pages with Flash, Shockwave and other multimedia. 
Remember to put alternative text links for the shockwave links.

Philip, I may not be fair to say that Bobby was sleeping on the job. 
Phil Jenkins covered most of the issues in his response to the original email. 
I do want to mention three things: 1. Bobby is not perfect. 
2. CAST requires that the page author conduct a number of manual checks. 
They do not always comply and we do notify sites when we are alerted of a problem. 
3. We note that the growing Bobby Approved database (currently at 921) available at is not monitored and we hope that those who use it will notify Webmasters or developers who enter sites that have not passed both the electronic and manual checks for WAI priority one conformance. 
Many thousands of sites are tested with Bobby. 
Some use the icon but many do not. 
Of the thousands that do, CAST does not have the resources to police compliance so we depend on you to help identify and perhaps even notify those who use the icon improperly. 
By the way, we do have someone who scans the database sites for material that we feel may not be appropriate for all viewing audiences and have removed quite a few from the list. 
Finally, we do welcome your comments and strive to continuously improve Bobby.
