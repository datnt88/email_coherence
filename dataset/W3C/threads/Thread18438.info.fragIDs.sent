<s> Greetings, I just wanted to relay to ACCESS-L that my company has recently developed a product called eScription which enables for live captioning over the Internet.  </s>
<s> eScription was originally designed for the media to provide real time, multi-language text over the Internet and was introduced at each of last October's Presidential Debates.  </s>
<s> (Demo http://www.speche.com/SpecheBox/SpecheBox.asp?ID=1)  </s>
<s> Our streaming text solution is base on streaming media technology and integrates with streaming audio and video if need be.  </s>
<s> In light of the explosion in Internet-based broadcasting to relay breaking news both financial and general as well as educational content, we feel strongly that the deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind communities are receiving an unfair disadvantage in terms of accessibility; we hope eScription addresses this discrepancy.  </s>
<s> In addition to providing real time text which aggregates into complete documents that can be retrieved and queried by key word, we have made the live captions modifiable by end users in terms of font color, style, and size.  </s>
<s> We hope that these alterations will help individuals who are visually sensitive to such differences.  </s>
<s> My company is not a captioning nor court reporting company, rather a technology partner for captioning and court reporting companies / organizations who are in need of a real time Internet captioning solution.  </s>
<s> I hope you do not mind my email and desire to share this innovation with you.  </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate any feedback that you may have in terms of our product.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.  </s>

<s> Jim, EMBED does not seem to be a part of the HTML 4.x of 3.2 specification.  </s>
<s> It has the same functionality at OBJECT.  </s>
<s> In the references that I have is that references in embeded objects use external programs for rendering.  </s>
<s> In this case it seems that the user agent would know that it is rendering a midi file, even if it is using a helper application.  </s>
