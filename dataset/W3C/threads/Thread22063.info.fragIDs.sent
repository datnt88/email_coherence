<s> I've just committed changes to build.xml,  </s>
<s> test-to-ecmascript.xsl and test-to-jsunit.xsl  </s>
<s> which generate tests that are designed to be run with JSUnit 1.3.3.  </s>
<s> The generated tests will not run with the JSUnit that was previously distributed.  </s>
<s> In its current state, the framework only supports loading HTML documents from an embedded iframe element (or loading XML documents using Mozilla if you change the "var builder = ..." line in DOMTestCase.js).  </s>
<s> Test deactivation based on parser attributes or content type is not supported, so only run html_alltests in the Core test suites if you are using the iframe loader.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer 6.0 and Mozilla 1.3a appeared to work from the local filesystem, but the results were not verified against the results from the previous framework.  </s>
<s> Any feedback is appreciated.  </s>
<s> I get build failures file:///C:/w3-cvs/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/transforms/test-to-jsunit.xsl;  </s>
<s> Line 31; Column 48; BUILD FAILED C:\w3-cvs\2001\DOM-Test-Suite\build.xml:1236: javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: xsl:import is not allowed in th is position in the stylesheet!  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> I only got a diagnostic message and missed it.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> All Builds complete now however I am getting a message in the DOM 2 HTML tests that I was receiving from before the transition to JsUnit 1.3.3 file:///C:/w3-cvs/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/transforms/test-to-ecmascript.xsl;  </s>
<s> Line 865; Column 19; Unrecognized element foo where foo is the name of the property being tested on each of the tests.  </s>
<s> The constructed test files all appear to lack the initialization of the variable containing the value being tested.  </s>
<s> A nightly build of xalan can be downloaded from I did not realize that the build errors were occurring only for the dom2-html-gen-jsunit.  </s>
<s> The problem appears to be related xmlspec-v22-dom.dtd that is expected in the lib/specs/pubtext directory.  </s>
<s> My initial attempt to fix the problem did not work, but you can work around it by running the "dom3-interfaces" target which will properly set up that file.  </s>
<s> The specs aren't affected by clean, so running dom3-interfaces once will hide the problem until you manually clean the specs directory.  </s>
<s> I missed committing a changed DOMTestSuite.js.  </s>
<s> It would not have have caused the build to fail, but it would have made it unrunnable.  </s>
<s> thanks for the heads up.  </s>
<s> however I was unable to get the DOM 2 HTML tests to build using ant 1.5.1, etc without the error I mentioned before.  </s>
<s> Can you make the version of xalan that you are using available somewhere?  </s>
<s> thanks, bob smime.p7s  </s>
