I promised a publishable version of the MT by Wednesday, but I may be a day late, as today was a lost day due to unforseen complexities. 
Sorry. 
Also, I will be unable to take part in the WG activities between 20 Sept and 14 Oct, including telecons, so would ask someone to take over the shepherding of the MT document through the W3C publication process once it is approved by the WG. 
It should be in workable HTML and need only very minimal editing. 
BTW, there is also the matter of whether rdf:SubClassOf should permit loops. 
As I have been acting as liason between the WG and the DAML+OIL committee on this issue, and think it is important, could I ask that someone else be willing to, er, shepherd it along while I will be away? 
Ora Lassila has been involved in all the relevant discussions at both end and may be willing do so.

While I'm not on the DAML+OIL committee, I would certainly be happy to help in whatever way I can on this end. 
(I already have an action to contact Sergey on this issue; I've sent email, and will try phone later).

I was planning to travel to France for a holiday, but have decided to put that off until things calm down, so I will be here and can continue WG activities.
