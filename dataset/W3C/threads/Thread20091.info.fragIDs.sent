Hi -- I just tried to open the links to my pdf files in the new version of Amaya and they still open up in the browser. 
Any thoughts about how to fix this? 
I'm running Win NT 4.0.

I just tried to follow a few links to pdf files and for each of them Amaya proposes to save the pdf file locally. 
It does not display the source PDF code. 
Could you send a URI that shows the problem? 
Vincent. 
It seems to be the case when we follow a link to a local pdf file.

There are two cases where Amaya displays pdf files as simple text files a) when theyare local files b) when the server sends them with a text mime type.
