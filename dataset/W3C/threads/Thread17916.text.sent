I encourage people to present arguments on changing checkpoint 4.8 from P2 to P1. If there is no consensus within the working group to change the checkpoint we will need to resolve the issue by leaving 4.8 at P2 level.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua leave at p because it does not render alternative content in the same way as synthesized speech does. 
we need to discuss the two because that is why one is p1 and the other p2. the reason we need p1 for speech synthesis is that alternate information will be provided through this rendering medium. the history of this is that since wcag states that audio description is at some point to be delivered in synthesized speech... p2 for audio because other means of controlling it are available and the user agent might not have access to the hard ware. 
if a user agent supports the p1 synthesized speech, than it needs to allow for controll like most do not today. 
that is the other component. 
they are tied together for purposes of rassionalle in this way.

quote I encourage people to present arguments on changing checkpoint 4.8 from P2 to P1. unquote aloha, jon! the argument is quite simple... there are many instances when i need synthesized speech at a certain level--which i can control on-the-fly thanks to the P1 requirement, if the wording of 4.10 is restored from "configure" to "control"--and the audio to play at a different level, in order that i can clearly and distinctly hear the 2 simultaneously... if i can't hear the synthesized speech because i can't adjust the volume of the audio source as it is playing, save by recourse to the OS' native volume control interface, i may have already missed out on what i needed to hear -- the synthesized content in conjunction with the audio -- especially if the audio is being streamed... it's akin to reading a page while looking at the illustrations with your peripheral vision, or the type of integration of textual and non-textual content one's brain makes to give one the gestalt view of the page when it is perceived in screenfulls, so i vote to raise 4.8 from P2 to P1 gregory. 
I would advance the same argument as Gregory. 
I think the requirement is to be able to individually control the volume of each sound source - whatever it is. 
Whether this is satisfied by the user agent or underlying system is immaterial, but in practical terms I suspect that User agents are not always easily able to expose multiple sources to the underlying system for individual control. 
Note also that synthesised speech is not necessarily the only form of audio content that is important - for users with visual, cognitive, and hearing disabilities there may be several types of audio running (music, synthesised speech for text content, spoken content such as audio descriptions, etc) and being able to distinguish what is going on in each channel (for example by playing one speech channel at a time) is the difference between having access and not. 
Just think of a teleconference where several people are speaking - our volume control is the chair... cheers Charles McCN quote I encourage people to present arguments on changing checkpoint 4.8 from P2 to P1. unquote aloha, jon! the argument is quite simple... there are many instances when i need synthesized speech at a certain level--which i can control on-the-fly thanks to the P1 requirement, if the wording of 4.10 is restored from "configure" to "control"--and the audio to play at a different level, in order that i can clearly and distinctly hear the 2 simultaneously... if i can't hear the synthesized speech because i can't adjust the volume of the audio source as it is playing, save by recourse to the OS' native volume control interface, i may have already missed out on what i needed to hear -- the synthesized content in conjunction with the audio -- especially if the audio is being streamed... it's akin to reading a page while looking at the illustrations with your peripheral vision, or the type of integration of textual and non-textual content one's brain makes to give one the gestalt view of the page when it is perceived in screenfulls, so i vote to raise 4.8 from P2 to P1 gregory.

Raising 4.8 to P1 level does not affect that minimal requirement.

My point is that control only of synthesised speech is not sufficient - that is the like the audio equivalent of having control over plain text but not heading or link text.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Being able to control the mix is critical - otherwise it doesn't matter if you can turn up or down the volume from outside the system (easily possible using common household equipment).
