<s> I would be happy to publish this version as our working document.  </s>
<s> Andy ::Comments:: Section 1: Intro Para2: "in industry and in open source projects" - some things are both.  </s>
<s> Would s/industry/commercial/ be better?  </s>
<s> Talks of standardization - doesn't W3C do "recommendations" so as to be clear they have no legal significance (c.f. safety standards).  </s>
<s> Para4: "less urgent objectives" I see the objectives as being things that are more difficult to determine whether we have met them or not.  </s>
<s> e.g. Human-friendly Syntax (well, app-writer friendly!) is very important.  </s>
<s> Section 2: Use Cases Very few of the UCs have "3.1 graph matching" as a requirement yet it probably applies to nearly all of them.  </s>
<s> Quite a few UCs have "Bookmarkable queries (3.8)" when I think it is just the fact the query can be written down in some syntax.  </s>
<s> The queries may be regualrly issued over SOAP/POST.  </s>
<s> 2.2: Finding Information about Motorcycle Parts (Supply Chain Management) Add motivates 3.4 subgraph results because the mounting bracket includes details of the screews needed.  </s>
<s> The query could not be written to anticipate every single possible extra piece of information that could be returned.  </s>
<s> I don't understand why "User-specifiable Serialization (4.4)" is motivated.  </s>
<s> 2.3: Finding Unknown Media Objects 2.4: Monitoring News Events.  </s>
<s> Both these are examples of bookmarkable queries being about recording the query.  </s>
<s> s/bookmarkable queries (3.8)/Human-friendly Syntax (4.1)/ 2.4: Add motivates "Aggregate Queries" (combine results).  </s>
<s> 2.5 Avoiding Traffic Jams Motivates: 3.3 Extensible Value testing I didn't see the connection to "Result Limits (3.10)" if we have "bandwidth-efficient protocol" Not sure this is a good example of the "Aggregate Queries" because different quesies go to different sources based what they are known to contain.  </s>
<s> This makes it different to 2.4 where the same vocabulary is present at each source.  </s>
<s> 2.6: Discovering What People Say about News Stories s/bookmarkable queries (3.8)/Human-friendly Syntax (4.1)/ 2.8: Sharing Vacation Photos Don't see the connection ot "Non-existent Triples (4.3)" I would not be worried if some techncial requirments are not directly connected to UC because the need for the requirment may not clearly be visible at the application/UI level.  </s>
<s> 2.9 Finding Input and Output Document for Test Cases Motivates: "3.1 RDF Graph Pattern Matching" and "3.2 Variable Binding Results", but not "User specifiable serialization" (I wasn't assuming the one line per result stuff was done by the query system).  </s>
<s> 3 Requirements I would s/mandatory/to be expected/ 3.9 Bandwidth-efficient Protocol This seems to be a difficult-to-quantify aspect and so is a design objective.  </s>
<s> I am not unhappy if it remains in the requriments.  </s>
<s> 4 Design Objectives 4.4 User-specifiable Serialization If this is saying RDF/XML vs application/N3 or whatever, it doesn't seem to be very strong.  </s>
<s> If this is saying that it could be XHTML as the serialization, then I think it gets outside of RDF data access - that is not to say that it isn't worthwhile but I wonder if the WG has the time to cover it.  </s>
<s> 4.5 Aggregate Query I suggest making this clearly about combining results: s/against/on each of the/ that is, the result of an aggregate query is the merge of the results of executing the query on each of the two or more graphs.  </s>
<s> That's what I meant.  </s>
<s> What do you mean by "doesn't seem to be very strong".  </s>
<s> I agree that it isn't *hard*, but it's one of those niggling details, IMO, that is useful to standardize.  </s>
<s> Kendall  </s>
<s> It kind of falls out of using HTTP/MIME-type negotiation.  </s>
<s> In the SOAP/POST world, I'm not sure what it would mean.  </s>
<s> There is only one serialization (RDF/XML); the rest have "lesser standing".  </s>
<s> For small devices n-triples might be helpful but if the device is so small it doesn't like XML, there is limit to what it's going to do anyway.  </s>
