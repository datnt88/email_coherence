Is there a group photo somewhere? 
e.g. from a F2F meeting? 
(I don't have a strong preference for which F2F meeting)

Somewhere near http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ the 1st f2f meeting record has photos, also a group photo from hawaii conf has a lot of wg members. 
My net connection too bad to track down details now, sorry... 
Thanks I think ham.jpg was the sort of thing I was after: title: "The RDF Core WG at work." (Pity that I am not in it ...) Anyone know who took it?

I've sets at although don't read too much into the word in the URL. 
Now that *is* a lesson :) Dave 
I have some snaps from the Bristol F2F, but none of them show the whole group and none are visually stunning. 
There is one nice shot of Brian looking very chairmanly.

That's right, very chairmanly! 
There's also some evolution observable in the image sequence although I'm not quite sure what is :) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/
