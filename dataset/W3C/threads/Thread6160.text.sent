Hi folks: Here's a proposed agenda for tomorrow's teleconference. 
1. Assign scribe, see who's here (5min) 2. Discuss the document Jean-Jacques posted [1] (50min) 2.1 Is this the right list of scenarios? 
2.2 Can we make the fuzzy ones crisper? 
2.3 Begin going through list and fleshing out individual scenarios (If possible, I'd like to see the scenario descriptions, in the abstract, completed by next week. 
If we can do that, we can use the next call for beginning to explore concrete proposals to integrate this stuff into WSDL 1.2, and also point the WSD/WSA groups at large to our work to see if it clears things up for the people who were unsure about this direction.) 3. Decide on date/time for next call (5min) Reminder : info on the call at http://www.w3.org/2003/02/14-pftf.html --Glen [1] http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~//2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/wsdl12-pftf-usage-cenarios.html 
Regrets for this upcoming meeting :-( - I am skiing in Park City, Utah with my children :-). 
Looks like a good start. 
I am somewhat concerned about how much we can have ready to present at the next F2F - two weeks out. 
Perhaps a portion of tomorrow's meeting could be spent discussing what kind of deliverable we can have for that meeting. 
I know Jonathan would like to see a resolution on features/properties by the end of the F2F, so it seems some kind of presentation to the group will be in order. 
I think the focus should be on the presentation, which means drilling in on the specifics of a couple of the more compelling use-cases -- and resisting spending too much time on the details of the rest. 
As a WSD WG member, I would want to know: o what are the use cases (we've started this discussion) o why can't this be solved with the general extension mechanism in WSDL? 
o what else might this affect other than WSD? 
I would like to volunteer to put time into putting together a presentation for the F2F. 
The Tuesday 11am EST is designated as our time slot going forward -- correct? 
Don Yes, that was my reading of Philippe's message as well. 
Enjoy your skiing holidays, Jean-Jacques. 
I fixed the time for this one. 
Given the time availability, I doubt that we can change it for our next call. 
Jonathan would like to have a weekly call for this TF as well. 
Philippe, who can cross-country ski in his street. 
Regrets for me too, I've decided to my daughter really needs me to accompany her on her class field trip today. 
They're going skiing :-).

Sorry about that.

Hi Don, Should we get time on the WSA agenda for the same presentation?
