W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA (thanks for doing the test, Jim) I have tested Amaya 2.2 and Netscape 4.7 and Lynx 2.8 (all on linux 2.2 - the results into the page: Everything works fine in Lynx v2.8 Amaya does not render the block content inside a map (case 5) - this is a known bug. 
In Both Netsacpe and Amaya it is difficult to tell that the links without visual separators (cases 1 and 2) are different. 
In Amaya you have to select the entire link to identify that it is separate. 
In Netscape there is no way to do that, so you have to run the mouse over the link, and look at the address in the status bar (Amaya doesn't put the target in the status bar, although it is available in the links view) Charles McCN What OS? Charles Here is what HPR hears: 1.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA I just wrote the following excerpt to the SVG Note (vector graphic images) and realized we don't actually have a general checkpoint or guidance for writing the component structure. 
We do have something for Headers or some other elements, but could we also have a more general statement at least at the explanation text? 
"Therefore it is important that the SVG authors carefully build the hierarchical component structure so that it reflects the components of the object illustrated by the image. 
Some guidance for using structure can be found under guideline 3 and 12 in [WAI-WEBCONTENT]."
