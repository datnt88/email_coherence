<s> UIEvent needs a detail arg to be passed to be initialized.  </s>
<s> but the initializer routines of KeyboardEvent and TextEvent do not get these?  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> How shall these handle this?  </s>
<s> Many thanks, Christian.  </s>

<s> TextEvent and KeyboardEvent don't use detail as a context information.  </s>
<s> UIEvent do have a detail parameter in init and it can be used by sub-classes, such as MouseEvent.  </s>
<s> In any case, the detail property value of TextEvent and KeyboardEvent has no specific meaning.  </s>
<s> I would suggest initializing to 0 but you can do otherwise in your implementation if you wish :) One can argue that it is possible to generate a valid Mouse event with using only initUIEvent, so I would be in favor of keeping the statu quo, i.e. the value of detail is undefined on text event and keyboard event.  </s>
<s> Applications may still wish to initialize the value of detail using initUIEvent (since it is supported in text and keyboard event objects as well) but it is certainly useless.  </s>

<s> Well, yeah, that's what I wanted to know.  </s>
<s> The detail property is undefined on interface KeyboardEvent and TextEvent so I can just set it to zero since the init methods in my implementation invoke the init method of UIEvent to initialize their values ;) btw, in my eyes it wasn't clear enough defined in the spec, so this should be explicitely said there.... Thanks, Christian.  </s>
