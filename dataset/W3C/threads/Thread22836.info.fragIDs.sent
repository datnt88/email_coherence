Hi, everyone, Sorry for this question is not about DOM. 
In XML we can specify the encoding, for example: JIS, Shift-JIS etc. Could you please tell me whether Java supports such encoding, and where I can refer to it? 
Thank you indeed!

As you said, this isn't a DOM question, but a Java question. 
Internally, Java strings use UTF-16, so encodings are only an issue when reading data 
into Java or writing it out. 
The Java libraries have some support for this; see the encoding parameter of InputStreamReader, for example. 
They may not 
support all the encodings you want to use, in which case you'd have to provide your own conversion code. 
The simplest answer from an XML point of view is just to use a parser/generator package that understands the encoding(s) you want to use.

... or OutputStreamWriter. 
In fact those two classes are the main ones to know if you're doing I/O of character streams, either to a device or to a byte buffer in memory. 
There are also methods on String that take an encoding name when generating byte arrays.
