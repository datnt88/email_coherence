Hello all, Would people be interested in discussing specification production issues at the W3C working group event [1]? 
I propose a meeting during the BOF lunch on Wednesday, 31 January 2001 [2]. 
Let me know if you're interested and what you would like to discuss. 
My interest stems from using an XHTML source and XSLT to generate the newest versions of WCAG 2.0 (based on the work of Charles McCathieNevile and the source for ATAG). 
Although I think the spec-prod dtd is cleaner, due to constraints of the human editors I am working with, using XHTML will make the process much easier. 
There are others on the W3C team who are interested in using XHTML and there was a suggestion that we discuss the classes that we are using. 
Perhaps we can create a standard set of classes to use with XHTML if one prefers to use that instead of the spec-prod dtd? 
However, I am not completely convinced that using classes and XHTML will give me as much granularity and control as I would like. 
Therefore, a discussion with the folks who developed the spec-prod dtd would be interesting. 
I would like to know if XHTML was considered. 
If it was, were there things that you couldn't do with XHTML and classes that you could with the spec-prod dtd. 
Or was XHTML not available at the time the spec-prod dtd was created? 
Are there other issues to discuss? 
Is there follow-up from the 15 August meeting [3] that needs to happen?

Could we meet again by phone, and would any BOF minutes be shared on spec-prod? 
I would like to find out what is adding extraneous markup to tables (thead, tbody, rowspan="1" colspan="1"), and whether we can use divs rather than tables for examples in XML specs.

It's entirely possbile; it's more likely to happen if you propose a specific time, get confirmation from a few folks, draft an agenda, etc. Count me interested, though only sparsely available. 
yeah... 
I hope so. 
Good question; folks are likely to miss it under this subject; I recommend you resend it with a more relevant subject.

I wish I could attend the event (do you mean February 28?), but unfortunately I can't make it. 
I'd be happy to attend a telecon, though, as this topic is definitely of interest to me as the XMLspec maintainer. 
When XMLspec was developed, it was probably the first truly conforming XML DTD in the world. 
So partly it was an XML proof-of-concept, but some of its more generic structures are reminiscent of HTML. 
It didn't use HTML as a base because it needed somewhat more structure in order to be more tractable for interesting processing, such as producing multiple outputs and adding lots of generated text. 
XHTML wasn't even a twinkle in anyone's eye yet (or maybe it was -- someone had brought up the idea of an "HTxML" quite early). 
I had lofty goals after the August meeting, but apparently W3C has not been able to free up resources specifically for spec-prod projects, and my time is more limited for XMLspec these days than I thought it would be. 
(I was hoping to have produced a V3.0 by now.) So we may need to take baby steps... Eve Eve Maler +1 781 442 3190 Sun Microsystems XML Technology Center eve.maler @ east.sun.com 
CMN: I am interested, I would reckon Monday or Tuesday evening. 
I want to discuss tools for working with a spec. 
(I have been essentially recreating the specML stuff in XHTML, since I have good editing tools for that...) I'm also interested in teh topic of using shared glossaries and references - becuase this makes groups talk the same language - more work to do, but possibly valuable results. 
It is sort of tangential.
