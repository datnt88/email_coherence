<s> As fate would have it, the first issue on the list is one that has been contentious in the past.  </s>

<s> Jim: Thanks for getting the issues list started.  </s>
<s> I believe that WebDAV must permit properties to have attributes.  </s>
<s> As you've pointed out, RDF and PRISM do use them extensively.  </s>
<s> A server can reformat  </s>
<s> the attributes in a subsequent PROPFIND request.  </s>
<s> Attrbiutes should be persistent.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mark  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> There is no reason not to persist attributes.  </s>
<s> I agree here.  </s>
<s> Maybe the way property values are round-tripped needs to be defined in terms of the XML infoset [1] or the Canonical XML rec [2].  </s>
<s> If a server supports "arbitrary" content of properties (like child elements with attribute, mixed content and so on), it will have to store the content in some XML friendly format anyway.  </s>
<s> Instead of storing the "value" of the property (all contained elements?), it can instead store the element (with all it's attributes and childs), thus preserving all attribute information.  </s>

<s> The question isn't about attributes in general, it is about *which* attributes.  </s>
<s> Consider the following: thevalue I believe everybody would agree that attr2 gets stored.  </s>
<s> The real question is about attr1.  </s>
<s> I see that attribute as part of the element that *names* a property, but it isn't part of the property *value*.  </s>
<s> IMO, PROP_ATTR is about defining the boundary between property naming, and a property's value.  </s>

<s> I agree with Greg et all that "attr2" needs to be stored.  </s>
<s> I believe that allowing "attr1" could lead to some interop problems, or we need to spec this out a little better: Is that legal?  </s>
<s> Does the attribute make the property unique?  </s>
<s> Does simply  </s>
<s> the value of an attribute make it unique?  </s>
<s> Or do we (like xmllang) simply store one set of attributes for a property?  </s>
<s> Also how does one use Dasl with attributes on properties?  </s>
<s> I would like to see attributes on the property name not be supported.  </s>

<s> No, it doesn't.  </s>
<s> If the language in section 4.5 ( http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.4.5 ) isn't clear enough on that, it should be enhanced.  </s>
<s> Who does?  </s>
<s> RFC2518 says that xml:lang must be preserved, but it doesn't say that there may be multiple copies of the property with different language values ( http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#ELEMENT_set ).  </s>
<s> I might agree, but not for the reasons given here.  </s>
