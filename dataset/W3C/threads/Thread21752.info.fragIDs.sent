[Regarding http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/intro] 
I've just a few comments:- * What's its reason for being? 
Do you have any particular use cases in mind for it, e.g. as a Wiki format? 
* s/range/en-dash/ 
* What if I want to put two em-dashes in succession (it's a valid scenario: used for when people get cut off in mid----)? 
It'll be interpreted as en-dash and a hyphen, which is not what I want. 
Same 
for other characters: what I mean is, are there any character escapes? 
* Can one cite references for blockquotes? 
* I don't think cramming hypertext into it is a good idea. 
URIs should be invisible where possible anyway. 
And text/plain isn't meant to have formatting characters spewed through it: that's part of the defintion of text/plain. 
If you're using atx as a source for transformations to HTML etc.--which appears to be its only use unless you're creating some sort of GUI for it--then you ought to register a media type for it. 
Overall, I'm not sure that atx is a good idea. 
That's a very odd thing for me to say because for months I've been puzzling over "plain text" formats such as this. 
I want to use features such as sec in XHTML 2.0, and it's difficult to do that in text (well, not that difficult--just use tabs--but it looks horrid). 
And all you're doing really is taking some structural bits of HTML and bunging them into an inferior format. 
If you're going to do that, you might as well propose a strict subset of HTML 4.01. 
Actually, I'd really like the W3C to do that: come up with an SGML based subset of HTML 4.01 that's something like XHTML Basic, but with a load of stuff fixed. 
It wouldn't even be difficult to develop. 
Sigh. 
Also, I presume you've got Python code for converting atx to HTML: could you link that from /2002/atx/intro? 
Cheers. 
Oh, and the atx form seems to have disappeared since you put the /2002/atx/ folder up. 
Unless I imagined it. 
Oh, and this is invalid XML, btw: attribute names matching "(?i)^xml", except for those specifically reserved by the XML specifications. 
Hmph. 
Your site is a good reason for switching to Mozilla, too. 
Damn IE and it's crappy CSS implementation. 
I'm seriously considering an All Web Formats Considered Harmful sort of rant. 
Time to start afresh, perhaps. 
It wouldn't be so bad if there was a format that didn't really, really suck... but we've got HTML (haha), text, (hahaha), and XML+CSS (bwahahaha). 
Oh well.

Or, more likely, em + em, since that's what'll match first. 
Heh, whoops. 
But my complaint still stands: we want character escapes!

Hi Aaron, 
Just read the beginning. 
How you will deal with internationalization? 
You start with a: Double quoting: ``Hello, World!'' and gives for rendering: Double quoting: "Hello, World!" Except that if I'm in a french context: The Double quoting: ``Hello, World!'' must be render as: Double quoting: ? 
Hello, World! ? 
and it will be different in spanish, german, etc. 
the thing I do not see, is that what you propose is a kind of "text to html2" language. 
And there's a lot of that already. 
What's new?

How do french speakers typically write ``Hello, World!'' in email? 
If they use French double quotes, then they should continue to use them. 
The conversion is mainly there because American double quotes are very difficult to type on American keyboards. 
(The same is true, I suspect, for the commonwealth.) 
None of them are very good. 
I want something good enough to replace HTML and XML for writers.
