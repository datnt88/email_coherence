<s> No. Password "authentication" is not an acceptable means of establishing a secure connection.  </s>
<s> It may be acceptable at the application layer, for example to control access to particular portions of a html document tree.  </s>
<s> In that case, the basic authentication or digest authentication occur at the application layer, independently of whether transport layer security is being used.  </s>
<s> I don't agree that that layering scheme is "not desirable".  </s>
<s> Normally, protocol definitions should provide mechanisms, and configuration options should be the means of enforcing policy.  </s>
<s> However if the STLP is defined in such a way as to allow weak authentication, it will not be meeting it's goals.  </s>
<s> As stated in the SSL spec, goal number 1 is cryptographic security.  </s>
<s> I hope most TLS working group members agree with that.  </s>
<s> I strongly recommend that STLP contain no provisions for password authentication.  </s>
<s> To me, the issue is not whether password authentication is weaker than authentication by certified asymmetric key; most everyone would agree that this is the case.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, for reasons ranging from established practice to portability issues to plain ignorance, many people will likely continue to use passwords for authentication for some time to come, whether protocol authors want them to or not.  </s>
<s> The issue at hand is therefore whether password-based authentication must continue to be as weak as the encryption available (which is often, as we all know, woefully weak), or whether, by our protocol design choices, we can make the security of password authentication as strong  </s>
<s> as it can possibly be.  </s>
<s> Nobody advocates forcing people to use passwords (even if it were possible to do so).  </s>
<s> The question is whether we can force them not to, and what to do given that we can't.  </s>
<s> Anyone who doesn't trust  </s>
<s> password-based security is always free not to support it; in fact, it takes an explicit decision by both parties to share a password before  </s>
<s> password authentication even becomes possible.  </s>
<s> People who make that decision are, in my view, no different from those who accept 40-bit encryption, or proprietary, relatively unstudied RC4 over heavily-analyzed (triple-)DES; we cryptographers might prefer that they choose otherwise, but we recognize that security must sometimes yield to  </s>

<s> I have to agree with Mr. Kemp.  </s>
<s> Passwords for purposes of authentication do not belong in a protocol that claims to provide cryptographic security.  </s>

<s> Personally, I love public-key cryptography.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, many people are not ready to convert to it yet, for at least two reasons I can think of offhand: there are entire infrastructures out there based on passwords, and people are loath to abandon them for a new technology that has had much less time to "settle"; and the technology for transporting asymmetric private keys to arbitrary trusted machines safely and conveniently is not yet widely available.  </s>
<s> Now, if I believed that the force of my eloquence could quickly convince them all to follow us cryptographers into a magnificent new era of public-key cryptography, then I would forget about trying to stick passwords into this working group's protocol.  </s>
<s> But I can't.  </s>
<s> And that means that passwords will continue to be widely used *regardless* of what we do.  </s>
<s> Moreover, a large fraction of those passwords will, for reasons we're all familiar with, be sent (or used to compute authentication responses sent) over connections only protected by 40-bit encryption keys.  </s>
<s> Passwords used in that manner are subject to offline brute-force attacks, first on the 40-bit encryption, then second (if necessary) on the password-based response.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if we incorporate password authentication into the protocol, then we can protect those passwords by basing the challenge-response protocol on both the password and the automatically-strong MAC key exchanged during the handshake.  </s>
<s> This will protect the password from offline attacks, making even a poorly chosen password a useful security tool (assuming that it's kept secret, and that the server doesn't permit unlimited online trial-and-error attacks).  </s>
<s> That's still not as secure as public-key cryptography, of course.  </s>
<s> But it's better than what password users will have otherwise.  </s>
<s> And the cost to people who *don't* want to support or implement passwords is *zero*.  </s>
<s> No extra code, no extra administration, no extra security risk.  </s>
<s> Only the vague feeling of unease over somebody somewhere else getting a chance to make a security decision that they (and I, to some extent) disagree with.  </s>
<s> Now, what's wrong with *allowing* password authentication into the protocol?  </s>
<s> Daniel Simon Cryptographer, Microsoft Corp. dansimon@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> A great deal, but I'm sure you already know most of it.  </s>
<s> It's big, it's slow, it's expensive to license (for a few more years anyway), it requires an infrastructure that is not in place (partially due to licensing issues of the underlying technology), it presents usability issues (you can type your password into any machine anywhere, but have to somehow carry your private key around with you) and on and on.  </s>
<s> Public key is also the "wave of the future."  </s>
<s> When "the future" will be remains to be seen, despite repeated assurances of RSN.  </s>
<s> It's a great technology, but mandating use of it and nothing else seems rather presumptuous and arrogant.  </s>
