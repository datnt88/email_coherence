Section 13.1 of the spec says that the DAV:resourcetype of an activity must be DAV:activity. 
This would seem to disallow an implementation where the resourcetype was, say: Is there a reason for saying that an activity's resourcetype must be (rather than include) DAV:activity?

No. In fact, I think this is what RFC3253 *should* be saying (similar considerations apply to version history resources). 
Geoff, I think this should be on the errata list.

That change is fine with me. 
If there are no objections, I'll add this as a closed issue to RFC-3253.
