<s> The DOM doesn't actually restrict the contents of most of its strings, though individual implementations may do so.  </s>
<s> However, the XML grammar _does_ restrict what characters may appear in an XML document.  </s>
<s> Numeric character references can't violate those rules.  </s>
<s> CDATASections don't change what's legal; they just provide an alternative to the numeric character referencs.  </s>
<s> If you need to represent characters which XML wouldn't permit, you have to implement an encoding scheme in your applications.  </s>
<s> The usual approach is to use a base-64 encoder/decoder, which is a fairly traditional solution to expressing arbitary binary data as character streams.  </s>
<s> Also remember that in some languages (such as C), the zero character is taken as end-of-string; you may find that you need to use a different string library to process the contents of this file.  </s>
