<s> Section 14.6 of RFC 2616 states that if a cache receives an age that is larger than it can represent, or if overflow occurs, then it must transmit an Age header with a value of 2147483648 (2^31).  </s>
<s> Was the intent to select the largest unsigned 31-bit integer, which is really (2^31)-1, or is there some other rationale behind this choice?  </s>

<s> 2^31 is the smallest positive integer which cannot be represented in a signed 32-bit value; was that it?  </s>

<s> I guess my main question is whether 1) it was the intent of the HTTP specification to pick a 'maximum' value which can be represented by a signed 32-bit value (and thus 2^31 was accidentally specified instead of 2^31-1), or 2) a conscious decision was made to specify a value outside of this range.  </s>
<s> The later case seems less likely, but if it's true then I'm having trouble seeing why such value was selected given that it's likely to add some (admittedly trivial) complexity to an implementation.  </s>
<s> The spec.  </s>

<s> More to the point, it's a big cache indeed that keeps an object for that long without validating it... *grin* Mark Nottingham  </s>
