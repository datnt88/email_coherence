<s> Hi group, here's my change request about fragmentation factors in "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility" document: Actual sentence: "the lack of an authorized translation of a guideline in a local language -- yet for WCAG 2.0, W3C/WAI expects authorized translations to be possible; " My proposal: "the lack of authorized translations of guidelines and raccomandations in local languages -- W3C/WAI is actually working on a authorized translations protocol to allow local W3C officies to start and translating guidelines in local languages;" My best regards, Roberto Castaldo IWA/HWG Member  </s>
<s> Including WCAG 2.0 gives the idea more weight, but if it doesn't happen,  </s>

<s> Is the initiative only for WAI or is it for W3C in general?  </s>
<s> If it's only for WAI documents perhaps it won't be sufficient to satisfy legislators.  </s>
<s> We could also say that translations are available and "managed" or "catalogued" by W3C and that there is nothing to stop governments approving these.  </s>

<s> Hi Alan, Alan:  </s>
<s> I think that the translation problem concerns the whole W3C, and all its documents  </s>
<s> Correct, also in Italy there is the same situation, but is overlapped by European Parliament decisions; an European Parliament document enforces all members to reach double A; local policies, like the italian one, can refer to EU raccomandations which are considered normative standards.  </s>
<s> It isn't a language problem.  </s>
<s> This is a general problem, and Italy or Spain may represent only one of the many situations that can happen all over the "non-english" world; in this vision, language could not be the only problem, but IMHO is the common one.  </s>
