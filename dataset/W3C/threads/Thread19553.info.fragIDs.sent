Although Amaya 2.0a doesn't appear to be able to parse XML yet, 
it does know about .xml and possibly the equivalent media type. 
However, when I tried it on a piece of XML from one of the earliest uses of XML, an IE4 channel definition file, it put up a save as dialogue. 
It seems to me that XML will often come with a custom media type, so the ability to force a URL to be parsed as XML would be desirable once XML parsing is properly implemented. 
(Incidentally it hung - menus were live, but stop, exit and end task were 
ineffective when I tried to load the CDF (renamed as .xml) 
from the local 
disk. 
I've had several hangs like this on other documents with Win32 v 2.0a.) 
Remember, XML is not language like HTML but rather meta-language. 
Therefore, I suppose, that Amaya does not support general XML itself, but rather only XHTML, which is extended version of HTML redefined in XML. 
Have a nice day Matthew 
DTD's are the actual meta-language. 
There is no reason why Amaya couldn't render any XML document that can be described using CSS (internally it more or less just has to treat xyz ... /xyz as span style="xyz" , except that it also has to allow block/list/inline overrides). 
Moreover, it ought to be able to edit XML structure, even if it cannot render it in the manner intended. 
The aspect that might cause structural problems for Amaya is that it must infer a DTD compatible with the document's de facto structure, although the DTD only needs to conform in the following ways: - the root element may only be at the root; - any other element must either require an end tag or never permit an end tag, but may be nested arbitrarily within any element with an end tag; - any attribute that is ever used for a particular element is an optional attribute for that element. 
Incidentally the test file that didn't make it hang, but wasn't successfully parsed, was the XML version of the XML specification!

If Amaya put up a save as dialogue, it's because it didn't get a right MIME type "text/xml". 
Could you check your server configuration? 
Amaya automatically detects the document format and displays it in a text format (including tags) when it's not able to apply CSS rules to the current structure. 
Amaya doesn't provide a full XML support yet. 
But it's already able to display and edit XHTML, MathML, and a subset of SVG. 
It uses XML namespaces to mix these structures in the same XML document. 
Could you send us the document or its URL to try it?

Although I've lost the Channel Definition File spec and IE4 is well known for ignoring Content-Types, I am pretty sure that the official Content-Type is not text/xml in this case, and my point was that in general XML is likely to be served with Content-Types that reflect the application not that it is XML. 
This is the rule when I had it configured, presumably from the MS spec, for Apache: AddType application/x-cdf cdf Netscape Fast Track is giving it as: application/x-netcdf by default. 
OK, I'll send the last one to cause the problem off the list.
