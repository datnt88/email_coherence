I was just checking through the requirements papers to see what has been covered so far, and what is missing. 
It looks pretty good. 
Aside from Relationships and versioning, which are known gaps, the following requirements are not addressed: Source retrieval -- Addressed briefly in 2.2 Standard Attributes, but this would be easy to miss. 
Although this strategy would work, it doesn't seem very intuitive to treat source as an attribute. 
The source is the resource. 
Partial Write --Judy Name:Judith A. Slein E-Mail:slein@wrc.xerox.com 
MailStop:128-29E The source attribute points to the URI of the resource which is the source of the document. 
Also, HTTP 1.1 supports partial writes. 
If my laptop doesn't die on me I should have a pre-edited copy of the spec out tomorrow night with the versioning section. 
I would very much like to hear how it stacks up. 
Yaron Thank you, Judy, for evaluating the specification against the requirements. 
I agree that some extra text emphasizing what the source attribute is useful for would be helpful. 
The idea of the source attribute is that if a GET is performed on a resource's source attribute, it lets the server know that it shouldn't perform any processing on the resource before transmission. 
It was initially conceived as a read-only attribute. 
I'm unsure whether this should only be a read-only attribute, though. 
There might be some value to having a place to write where the client would be guaranteed the server would not perform any processing on the resource which was just PUT. - Jim
