<s> In 2.12.2 the example uses LABEL with for and id attributes where it is possible to simplify and include the INPUT as content of LABEL and forget about the for and id stuff.  </s>
<s> Maybe it would be better to give both possibilities in examples.  </s>
<s> In 2.12.3 it says you should use the for attribute.  </s>
<s> I can't see why.  </s>

<s> What's wrong with the HTML4.0 spec.? One should use "for" in my opinion, only when it is impossible to put the INPUT inside the LABEL (if they are in different table cells for example).  </s>
<s> Also I didn't get the idea behind writing the control and its label in the same line when "for" is not used.  </s>
<s> I am unfamiliar with a "line" concept in HTML.  </s>

<s> I see.  </s>
<s> I think that for the long run it is better to show that using LABEL is very simple, if you don't use tables for layout.  </s>
<s> This way you'll get many more accessible forms in the long-run.  </s>
<s> Instead of telling people: "look, if you don't use TABLEs for layout it is very easy to add LABELs to your forms; just wrap the control and its label with the LABEL tags, but if you insist using tables then you'll also need to write for and id", you're saying: "to write accessible pages you should work around what the WAI's favorite browser does not support."  </s>
<s> Also the method of "place holding characters" in text fields ("type your name here") is not that good as it reduces usability.  </s>
<s> The user wastes time deleting these characters when filling the form.  </s>
<s> Now that we have LABEL we can abandon this usability reducing technique.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what nir dagan said:  </s>
<s> Here is one way we could approach this.  </s>
<s> The degree of focus, or selectivity between short term and long term could be different in the guidelines, the techniques, and the educational materials.  </s>
<s> There is decreasing stability, increasing expected rate of change, in the guidelines, then the techniques, then the training materials.  </s>
<s> Mostly in the last would there be a focus that emphasizes one timeframe, and that should be short-term.  </s>
<s> The guidelines would, in this view, state principles that apply across short-term and long-term techniques.  </s>
<s> The Techniques document would expose all the techniques, whether short-term or long-term.  </s>
<s> It would not suppress techniques just because they are effective only now or only then.  </s>
<s> The EO materials could emphasize what can be done in web content with today's browsers in the field, but would need to be prepared to be rewritten to emphasize different techniques as the become relevant.  </s>
<s> I am not sure I agree with this usability assessment.  </s>
<s> The LABEL is at risk of being harder to understand than a fully-spelled-out in-place instruction, and the erase field operation is simple.  </s>
<s> But that is not for the techniques document to decide.  </s>
<s> It should err on the side of being inclusive of all techniques that work.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> The "line concept" is in how a true screen reader reads the rendered Browser display, not the HTML entity tree.  </s>
