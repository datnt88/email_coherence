How can I disable some menu options of Amaya? 
I tried to modify the EDITOR.A file, removing some lines, but it did not work. 
The reason for this is that Amaya will be called from another application, and this application should not allow the user to edit the file. 
He/she can not also open another document, unless the document is referenced in some link of the current document.

Did you recompile those using the app compiler, then rebuild the workspace? 
The easier is to change the Amaya profile with the menu: Special/Preferences/Profiles I guess the profile browser will solve your problem.
