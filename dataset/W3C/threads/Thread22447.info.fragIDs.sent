Am I right in thinking that these methods are going to be very inefficient? 
Assuming a child node has no prior knowledge of the previous/next nodes in the tree, all it can do is: 1. Get its parent node 2. Get the children of the parent node 3. Run through the list to find itself 4. Return the previous/next as applicable 
The only way this could be improved is by adding next/previous pointers to each node which will a) increase memory use and b) make editing the tree very tedious. 
Also, given the current DOM, there are no methods for setting the previous/next so this approach isn't possible. 
Have I understood this correctly? 
Also, can I reiterate the call for a new draft. 
It sounds from recent emails that major changes are afoot and it would be nice to get them in before people in our wider organisation start using the code I've been writing.

Remember that the DOM is an *interface* (in the Java sense, or in the sense of a C++ abstract base class), not a data structure. 
I agree that a data structure with next/previous pointers would make the getNext/getPrevious siblings much more efficient to implement than the basic "structure model" exposed by the DOM, but we want the DOM to be as "thin" as possible and as compatible with multiple implementations as possible. 
[By "implementation", we mean "a product that supports the DOM as an API", e.g., one of the HTML and/or XML browsers, HTML and/or XML editors, document management systems, publication systems, etc.] For example, one implementation might use a tree of multiply-linked lists; another might use an array of arrays. 
However one navigates the native data structures, we want convenient, standardized DOM methods to work. 
So one implementation of getNextSibling might navigate via a Next pointer, another might increment an array index; either would be efficient in that implementation, but specifying too much implementation detail does not help achieve the goals of the DOM. 
Is that clearer? 
One more point (that may or may not be a digression): The DOM's primary goal is to promote INTEROPERABILITY, not efficiency. 
Assuming, for example, that both Microsoft and Netscape support the DOM someday in their browsers, the idea is that one can write a script, JavaBean, etc. that works with both. 
It may be that some approach is far more efficient in implementation one than another, and the vendor is free to steer the DOM programmer toward the more efficient approach on their particular implementation (and of course the other vendor could steer the DOM programmer toward a different approach). 
Yet we'll consider the DOM a success if the script/Bean/control WORKS on both even if it works BETTER on one or the other. 
We hope to have public draft out in the next 10 days. 
I'm sorry this process is taking longer than we hoped, but I for one am convinced that the current draft is quite a bit cleaner, leaner, and meaner than its predecessors; I hope that you find your patience rewarded!

There are a number of ways of maintaining the nextSibling() and previousSibling() information. 
These are *very* useful for many things, so it was felt wise to incorporate them as standard API's.

We're aiming to get a new draft out with Core and XML updates next week.
