[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last Call comment period.] 
Section 6.2.4 The description of how the children property of the element node is constructed from PSVI indicates that if the [schema normalized value] property exists, and the processor chooses to use that means of setting the property, the order of nodes in the sequence is implementation defined. 
This should be phrased to indicate that only the text node will be in some implementation-dependent position relative to the PI and comment children, but the order of the PI's and comments themselves is the same as in the [children] property. 
Thanks, Henry [Speaking on behalf of reviewers from IBM, not just personally.] Henry Zongaro Xalan development IBM SWS Toronto Lab T/L 969-6044; Phone +1 905 413-6044 I personally find this reordering of comment nodes abhorrent. 
Changing to is a gross violation of data integrity and we should not sanction it. 
Michael Kay If you provide data-centric application the ability to fold their value (and thus provide better performance) then this is one of the consequences. 
And I think this is an acceptable trade-off... Best regards Michael From: public-qt-comments-request@w3.org [mailto:public-qt-comments- request@w3.org]
