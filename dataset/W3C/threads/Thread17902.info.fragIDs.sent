Hello, I've published a document that proposes a framework for determining conformance requirements for the checkpoints of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. 
I estimate that the checkpoints in sections 1 and 2 can be readily 
addressed and that the WG should focus on section 3. Comments on all are welcome (e.g., whether you agree with the categorization, whether you think a different categorization would be better for thinking about the checkpoints, etc.).

To avoid flooding the issues list, I propose that we update this document in place as we identify the requirements for each checkpoint. 
The document includes a "Last Modified" date at the bottom. 
If anyone feels that this document should not be modified in place and that we should be able to refer to older versions, please let me know. 
I have just updated the document based on the results of today's teleconference. 
There are links to the minutes. 
Please note that this document is meant to be a tool for helping us resolve issue 257. 
The expectation is that after we have finished, we will fold the results directly into as discussed at the 4 May teleconference [3]. 
There was consensus on the call today that identifying conformance requirements now rather than later is a good idea.

This seems like a sensible process. 
I assume that the document is kept under CVS, and that it is therefore relatively simple to get older versions.
