<s> Andrew, Somebody on the list mentioned that Attributes are Nodes because WG wanted NodeIterator to access the attributes.  </s>

<s> For that purpose, I would like to recommend the following convience method be added to either Element or AttributeList: wstring getAttributeValue( wstring name );  </s>

<s> I agree with Andrew: In many cases, the XML parsers will have expanded the entity references during parsing - that will be true in SAX parsers (at least at SAX level 1).  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me how parser writers should be treating Entity References.  </s>
<s> Are they used as mere variables in which case, we should maintain them in nodes so that application writers can change their values and have the DOM represent the current value, or are they more like a classical preparser convenience, substituted before building the DOM.  </s>
<s> Note: the internals of the SAX parsers I have seen expand the references as they see them - this is not the way the DOM hierarcy works.  </s>
<s> How do people anticipate that application writers will treat Entities?  </s>
<s> It is very important to understand the assumptions being made with the complexity added for Attribute values.  </s>

<s> Actually, SAX is a little more complicated -- the application has two options for each external entity reference: 1) ask the parser to resolve it; or 2) provide an alternative resolution (including possibly an empty stream).  </s>
<s> More generally, entity references should be invisible to production processes (such as those targeted by SAX), but they will, of course, matter to authoring tools.  </s>
