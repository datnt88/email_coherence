Hello, The next AUWG conference call will take place at the regular time: Monday, August 4 at 4:00 pm ET (617) 761-6200 ext. 
2894# August 4 is a Canadian Civic Holiday, so this may be a smaller meeting than usual. 
(1) Make some headway in the Action Item review (see last agenda): (2) AUWG-F2F Planning 26-27 Sept. 2003 in Seattle, USA (Host: Adobe) (Note: Dublin Core 2003 Meeting is also in Seattle immediately after the AUWG meeting, 28 Sept. - 2 Oct) Please send regrets or agenda additions to the list. 
FYI: The dates of the next two meetings will be: - August 18 - September 1 Jan Richards, User Interface Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto Web: http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/jan/richards.html 
Given that most group members are engaged in either vacation or holidays I propose that we cancell the August 4th teleconference. 
The next teleconference will be on August 18th. 
Jutta Aww, and this was one I _knew_ I could make. 
:) Okey dokey, August 18th is good. 
I have no action items. 
I should get some.
