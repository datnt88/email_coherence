<s> I promised the Content group I would send the User Agent group this question: Do user agents generate a 0,0 to the server if an area on a server-side image map is not selected?  </s>
<s> We would like to know if redundant text links could be returned if a server receives 0,0 but are not sure if all browsers generate it.  </s>

<s> What do you mean by "not selected"?  </s>
<s> What causes the coordinates to be sent to the server?  </s>
<s> Whether they generate it or whether they should are, as usual, distinct questions.  </s>
<s> From the HTML 4.01 specification, section 13.6.2 [1]: User agents that do not offer the user a means to select specific coordinates (e.g., non-graphical user agents that rely on keyboard input, speech-based user agents, etc.) should send the  </s>

<s> This also seems to have been the long-standing situation in practice, as far as I could tell (unlike some other specialised areas where the specs get widely disregarded!) My notes on this topic aren't up-to-the-minute, but might still be useful, http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/alt/imgmap.html There's at least one server-side imagemap evaluator that can use the server-side imagemap for constructing a text menu when it seems that it's being called from a text-mode browser.  </s>
<s> Of course with the widespread deployment of client-side imagemaps, dealing effectively with server-side ones has seemed less urgent.  </s>
<s> There's a somewhat different scenario with INPUT TYPE=IMAGE (which can also be considered to be a kind of server-side imagemap).  </s>
<s> I have some earlier notes on that in the same area, Hope this is useful (I'm not a specialist in these matters, just an interested dabbler.) best regards  </s>
