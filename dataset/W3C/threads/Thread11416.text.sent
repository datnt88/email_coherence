We have just been given five fairly important proposals to consider. 
What you don't know, but will find out in a couple of days when he gets to his destination in France, is that Tim Bray is about to drop a roughly equal number of questions related to xml-link into this group. 
Given our objective of having fairly solid versions of xml-lang and xml-link for 1.0 out by July 1, it seems fairly obvious that we are going to have to make some decisions about what gets dealt with first. 
We don't have to make the cut right now, but it would help if in the course of discussing Jean's proposals you also indicated whether you feel that the feature in question is one that needs to be addressed in XML 1.0 or whether it falls into the class of things that can be added later. 
Jon I am replying to this from the point of view of an implementer of POC tools. 
It will be critical that by July 1 the language is supported with a reasonable amount of prototypes that show the concepts to be both implementable and useful. 
AIUI! 6 weeks from now. 
I assume that the (so far undisclosed) xml-link proposals will also vie for priority. 
In the absence of the xml-link proposals, I comment on the feasibility of getting SD[1-5] finalised and demonstrated by July 1: SD1 (short tags). 
This is trivial for parser writers, but I am no longer in favour of it because (a) I suspect some XML documents will be hand-authored (or at least hand-edited) - a rich source of confusion - and (b) error recovery for missing endtags in WF documents would be effectively error creation. 
SD2 (structured attributes). 
This seems to require either (a) rewriting SGML and the parsers or (b) doing some fairly cunning pre-parser manipulation. 
I cannot see a working prototype by July 1, even if we agreed the syntax today, since there would be too many implied semantics to be resolved quickly. 
It would also break the Esis and ElementTree output and although it might be representable by groves, there are not yet any XML applications that use groves? 
SD3 (Data types). 
I don't think there are syntactic problems here, although I suspect the namespace of potential types is sufficiently large that we would debate for some time. 
(Date?, Date+Time?, DateTime?, etc. and there will also have to be discussion about floats - precision, overflow behaviour, format specification, etc.) I wouldn't object to a placeholder and make as much progress as possible. 
SD4 (Schema format). 
I am in favour of a DTD that describes DTDs (JUMBO has a class DTDDTD to manage and display DTDs) and I'd welcome development here. 
I see this as an application outside of the syntax, and possibly outside the language, but would be happy to explore it. 
SD5 (Name space). 
This is urgent but I suspect it will take a week or two for the discussion to settle down. 
It looks as if it will have to impact on the parsers (or require a pre-parser) and there are non-trivial issues about how the semantics for a colliding tag are carried into the application. 
So I can't easily see it being implemented by July 1 although I'm happy to help in the effort since it's so important. 
P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences Right. 
Having short tags will complicate error detection and recovery... it will add one more reason for requiring a DTD. 
Right. 
You also run into a large number of I18N issues. 
I have no objection to defining an application profile for types, but would object to having it in the parser. 
Havin an application profile would require the definition of some way of hooking a notation validator into the processing stream. 
Very well put. 
Omitting GIs from end-tags removes redundancy; and therefore inevitably reduces the possibility or error detection (see anything by Claude Shannon). 
Someone's idea that it allows us to avoid even having a "wrong GI in end-tag" message and that that is an advantage, is only tenable if when that error actually occurs, what one wants *instead* is a parser that silently assigns the wrong end-tag without even noticing that it's wrong. 
Note that massive changes are only required if you wish XML to *validate* or constrain such attributes. 
You can stuff a stream of SGML or Lisp or whatever in an attribute *right now* and have structure. 
I don't see your point about "too many implied semantics" -- we don't have to say any more about semantics in attributes than we do in content. 
For ***example***, we could easily state the syntax requirements for putting structure inside attributes, simply by using XML syntax there (gee, you have to escape quotes), or by using Lisp/Scheme/DSSSL Scheme syntax there (gee, you still have to escape quotes). 
Just cite either definition. 
This may or may not be the best thing to do, but the syntax is easy and we don't have to touch semantics. 
I thought the proposal was to take a very small, specific set of types: the atomic datatypes agreed on in RDBs. 
Not a big deal. 
And there are plenty of standards for exactly how such things behave (if we even have to care): IEEE floating point, for example, which almost everybody uses. 
Just cite the existing literature. 
Differing from it would be hugely more work, make us gratuitously incompatible, and make us look foolish unless/until we showed superb and compelling reasons. 
SGML already gets flak for not having ubiquitous types like integer, real, character, and so on. 
If we were to add those (I'm not certain we should, just "if"), I think few people would complain that we didn't also add imaginary and transcendental numbers, polynomials, color spaces, and so on.
