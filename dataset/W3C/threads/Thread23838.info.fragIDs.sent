too calm, if you ask me... 
I'm wondering. 
Is there any possible way to embed a font into a web page?? 
Everyone has seen IE, and how an ActiveX control would install itself. 
I 
figure it could be possible since if someone wanted a plugin to run, that file would be embeded within the html and it would start if you had that helper app/plugin that supported it. 
Thanks for any ideas, help etc. Later.

Acrobat. Get Acrobat 3 set up with your browser and see the examples near the bottom of http://www.killersites.com/3-pdf/ . 
Contrary to popular belief, PDFs are often smaller than the equivalent material in HTML.

Better make sure that the fonts you are about to embed by one method or another can be embedded. 
Emigre fonts, FontFonts (from FontShop) and many of the smaller libraries do not permit users with normal licenses to embed fonts in pdf files, or in webpages. 
Doing so could cause some bad things as the library people could claim you started distributing the font to many many people without permission, or payment. 
The fact that technically it might be possible does not mean it is a wise direction for the time being.

I assume you can unsubscribe by sending mail to www-font-request@w3.org with the subject "unsubscribe" (or possibly nothing for the subject and "unsubscribe" in the body). 
Sending irate messages to the hundreds of people on this list will neither get you off the list nor earn you any friends. 
I know it's a pain to get off mailing lists sometimes, but it's not the fault of everyone else reading them.
