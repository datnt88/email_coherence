<s> I'm wondering.  </s>
<s> Is there any possible way to embed a font into a web page??  </s>
<s> Everyone has seen IE, and how an ActiveX control would install itself.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> figure it could be possible since if someone wanted a plugin to run, that file would be embeded within the html and it would start if you had that helper app/plugin that supported it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for any ideas, help etc. Later.  </s>

<s> Contrary to popular belief, PDFs are often smaller than the equivalent material in HTML.  </s>

<s> Better make sure that the fonts you are about to embed by one method or another can be embedded.  </s>
<s> Emigre fonts, FontFonts (from FontShop) and many of the smaller libraries do not permit users with normal licenses to embed fonts in pdf files, or in webpages.  </s>
<s> Doing so could cause some bad things as the library people could claim you started distributing the font to many many people without permission, or payment.  </s>
<s> The fact that technically it might be possible does not mean it is a wise direction for the time being.  </s>
