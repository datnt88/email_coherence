<s> 1. Contexts of use.  </s>
<s> The requirements for 'capture' are more severe than for 'authoring.' Make 'capture' [in a real-time context] one of the contexts of use.  </s>
<s> While people thought about Erik's mention of real-time applications in terms of the transport and chunking issues, nobody seems to have pulled up to the surface and really looked at the implications for the originating process in a real-time application.  </s>
<s> The term "authoring" is too static.  </s>
<s> The discussion to date has not really grasped the climate of values that arise in the creation of timed text in a live event situation[2].  </s>
<s> The point is that by character count more timed text streams arise more in the process of instrumenting meetings for access by the hearing impaired and for instant replay than in the preparation and distribution of highly- polished publications such as movies and other merchant multimedia products.  </s>
<s> The TT format should meet the needs of the MMI group to support real time  </s>

<s> In this case the  </s>

<s> The playback need not be quite so lockstep, as will be discussed in a subsequent point.  </s>
<s> 2. Limits on control of playback timing in consideration of accommodating individual needs.  </s>
<s> Someone talked about the mission of the timing information as controlling the display of the text.  </s>
<s> The previous point attempts to make it clear that there are equally valid use cases where no control is implied, that the timing marks are there to document what was observed during capture.  </s>
<s> In addition, it is necessary to put an inch of daylight between the timing as marked and the display process as realized[3,4].  </s>
<s> The point is that there are relaxed display protocols which are plausible propositions as reasonable accomodation, and these should be in our library of timeDisciplineDomainLinking scenarios.  </s>
<s> Glenn asked if there were anything that needed to be considered in consideration of those reading the text via a Braille display.  </s>
<s> Initially I said that there was no special markup.  </s>
<s> The timing information should be able to be orthogonal to Braille-specific issue without too much difficulty (still want to make sure that it is.  </s>
<s> See more on orthogonality below).  </s>
<s> However, in kicking this around in the WAI/PF group a *playback* requirement did seem to emerge.  </s>
<s> This was the remark that a Braille presentation of text timed that had been authored on the assumption of visual display might frequently be too fast for the user to follow.  </s>
<s> Or to digest quickly enough to be satisfied with lockstep push control of the display.  </s>
<s> So we came up with a playback concept where the authored access units of text would become available to the assistive playback module at the author-planned events within the timebase of the playback or meeting context; but that these would not necessarily pre-emptively overwrite the display, but could be presented in a scrollable stream-of-lines buffer much like a virtual scroll-mode terminal.  </s>
<s> Both manualAdvanceToNextLine and popOnUnlessScrollLock modes are candidates, and either one would probably need a catchUp that is escapeToNow verb as well.  </s>
<s> In any case, without claiming that the exact relaxed-sync mode of accessing the text in the Braille line display has been fully developed, please be aware that having the timed text dumped into an accessUnitQueue at the client node to accomodate more user-directed display timing in the case of Braille access is something that asForNow *should be possible and permissible*, because the risk that the lockstep display or scrolling display will not be usable is too real based on the current state of knowledge.  </s>
<s> Where I say 'permissible' this means do not place language in the specification that appears to forbid such user-controlled final display timing, rather integrate the user control requirements of the UAAG into the final specification.  </s>
<s> [Note that while the UAAG specifically states that buffering is not required, in the case of timed text it may be reasonable to require, or anticipate the provision of, some buffering at this point.] 3. Architectural approach: IPPD -- Integrated Product and Process Development: Develop Proof-of-Pudding demonstration cases, not just format requirements.  </s>
<s> As Glenn said, the goal is to support a timing aspect in as modular a fashion as possible.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the caption industry will need a fully-formed ready-to-use profile of data formats.  </s>
<s> The project probably has to have some module encapsulation and some profile integration *both* in its work products.  </s>
<s> Making the timing model independent of XML is attractive, or at least a wire format binding over bare RTP where the RTP packet payloads are not guaranteed to be well-formed XML in themselves but the timing is still entirely documented is something that should be considered before being rejected.  </s>
<s> What is emerging in my mind as the right process approach to the development and qualification of modules is that there should be some evaluation profiles defined even 'though they do not become part of the normative provisions of any specification.  </s>
<s> Just of the text and evaluation master plan for the module.  </s>
<s> There are a bunch of -ability operational requirements such as streamability.  </s>
<s> I tried above to argue that there are applications that are intrinsically stream at the source and so it is not just a distribution convenience to be compatible with streaming conditions.  </s>
<s> These -ability requirements should be demonstrated before the work product becomes a Proposed Recommendation.  </s>
<s> So the determination of the "CR exit criteria" -- scenarios to have been demonstrated -- is as important as line by line Requirements at the "what the format can represent" level.  </s>
<s> There are suitabilityForIntendedUse concerns that do not map well to 'requirements' that one can verify in a desk check of the format spec.  </s>
<s> If we spend some time outlining cases for evaluation at various stages in the development and deployment of the technology, we can perhaps spend less time in endless circles debating Requirements that are an awkward medium to capture what we really care about.  </s>
