<s> yes, we're discussing the label element and explicitly associating it with its control.  </s>
<s> for example, text input fields (example given in guidelines).  </s>
<s> the problem we are trying to avoid is confusing authors so that they create a label to associate with a button.  </s>
<s> This would be a problem since, as you pointed out, a button implicitly has a label that is displayed on its face (its "name").  </s>
<s> A button could also have alt-text associated with it.  </s>
<s> Thus, it is not necessary for an author to create a label and associate it with a button.  </s>
<s> we need to ensure that the guidelines are not misleading and authors don't create extra work for themselves.  </s>
