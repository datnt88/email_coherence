<s> The new draft is now available - Please note that the sample implementations in the techniques document have not been reordered yet.  </s>
<s> I will do that for the Last Call draft on Friday.  </s>
<s> I have also not yet updated the changes or issue list - again, both of those will be done for Friday.  </s>
<s> First I need a bit of sleep and some food *grin* Thanks everyone for the hard work on getting to this stage.  </s>
<s> Although there is a long way to go, getting to last call is a big milestone.  </s>

<s> I've read through all the other W3C documents.  </s>
<s> Most of them take the approach of defining element, attribute and property under document as well.  </s>
<s> As a result there are none that offer a more expanded definition of the term document on its own but only as it is made up of elements, attributes and properties.  </s>
<s> Ian you had a definition from the CSS document (which wasn't in their glossary) could you send that to the list so we can recycle it.  </s>
<s> Thanks Jutta  </s>
<s> I looked it up in Webster via "Do The Right Thing" (A really neat service from Gerald Oskoboiny, maintainer of the Kinder Gentler Validator, sysadmin at w3c and all-round nice Canadian) and the definition there seemed deficient too.  </s>
<s> But it gives (among some things that do not really apply): a writing conveying information a material substance having on it a representation of thoughts by means of some conventional mark or symbol I think we can (and in practice already do) rely on the common understanding of the term, broad and ambiguous as that necessarily is, and live without our own definition.  </s>

<s> How else do you want to define document?  </s>
<s> Refer to "Source Document" (from [1]).  </s>
<s> Source document The document to which one or more style sheets refer.  </s>
<s> This is encoded in some language that represents the document as a tree of elements.  </s>
<s> Each element consists of a name that identifies the type of element, optionally a number of attributes, and a (possibly empty) content.  </s>
<s> Maybe refer to the Web Characterization Terminology [2] (though they don't define document).  </s>
