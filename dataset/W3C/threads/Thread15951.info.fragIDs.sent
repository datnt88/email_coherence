<s> "It is rare to see a web animation that has any goal besides annoying the user." and "Web design is impoverished because too many sites strive for the wrong standards of excellence that made sense in the print world but do not make sufficient advances in interactivity." are the "nugget bites" in a recent Jakob Nielsen item at: The root site is tantalizing because though he is talking about "usability" it so often equates with our goals - hence validating the notion of Universal Design as well as "electronic curb cuts."  </s>
<s> I've never gotten any response from him about participating in our efforts - does anyone hereon ever deal with him?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I've talked with Jakob on a few occasions.  </s>
<s> You're not likely to get any response from him right now because he left Sun about 3-4 months ago and has embarked on his own business journey with Don Nelson, another usabilty icon.  </s>
<s> Jakob's interest in accessibility (for disabilities) is mild at best.  </s>
<s> What he's done, he's done based on requests at Sun from Eric Bergman and Earl Johnson, both of whom contributed a nice chapter on accessibility in one of Jakob's recent books.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Jakob has close ties to the W3C and usability in general.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if he's still active in the WG's...but he's been present at all of the Web Conferences.  </s>
<s> The fact that there is a close time between usability and accessibility is not new.  </s>
<s> When I was at Digital, I merged with the usability group.  </s>
<s> Earl and Eric have close ties to the User Interface/usabilty group too.  </s>
<s> You'll find similar efforts at IBM, Microsoft and Apple.  </s>
<s> It's a natural fit....what hasn't been natural is including accessibility as part of the standard usability test and design methodology.  </s>
<s> This is an area that I have been trying to encourage over the past couple of years.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the best stimulator may be the new NSF Grant program.  </s>
<s> I am submitting a proposal.  </s>

<s> That's Donald Norman, another of my favorites, author of such classics as "The Design of Everyday Things" (published earlier as "The Psychology of Everyday Things" in hardcover), "Things That Make Us Smart" and "Turn Signals are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles." Norman's focus has been design of physical objects and environments used by people, ranging from consumer products to airplane cockpits.  </s>
