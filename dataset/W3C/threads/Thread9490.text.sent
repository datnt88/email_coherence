Well, I just finished reading an interesting discussion on #rdfig on this issue[1], and folks seem to be making it more complicated than I think it is, but I hope to provide some ideas on where to go. 
Here's what my Media Type draft says: Because RDF is a format for semantically-meaningful information, it is important to note that transmission of RDF under this media type, whether via HTTP, SMTP or some similar protocol, means that the sender asserts the content of the RDF document. 
If this is not desirable, such as when a system is forwarding RDF written by someone else, another applicable media type, such as application/xml or application/octet-stream should be used. 
Also note that RDF provides reification so that RDF statements can be sent and discussed without actually being asserted themselves.

Media Type for Resource Description Framework (RDF) Tim Berners-Lee brought up three points which he felt would close this issue: 1) The meaning of a document is the conjunction of the meanings of its statements. 
2) The meaning of a statement is defined by the specification of its predicate. 
3) The meaning of { :x rdf:type :c} is defined by the rdf:type definition which delegates the meaning to the definition of :c . 
DanC felt that the meaning Tim meant by "meaning" wasn't shared by the rest of the math/science/+ world, but that he at least agreed with point 1. 
In response, Tim said: "The other two I declare to be true as director of the consortium.

| i'm working to make it happen I might comment on TBL's points (not that I am necessarily going to disagree!) later, but I do want to comment on this first bit. 
Perhaps I don't understand all the semantics associated with a media type, but it seems to me that this merges the notion of what the language or representation of the content is with what it means, at least to some extent. 
Consider the case mentioned above, where the system is forwarding RDF written by someone else. 
The proposal seems to say that I'm forced to obscure what the language being sent actually is, i.e., RDF, in order that it won't be misunderstood (as a set of assertions by the sender). 
It seems to me that the proper approach would be to have the MIME type correctly indicate which processor ought to handle the content (an RDF processor), and then some RDF mechanism (e.g., however we decide to handle provenance?) ought to be available to indicate whether that RDF is to be interpreted as assertions by the sender, or something else. 
It seems to me that RDF is supposed to be about handling this "meaning" business, and we ought to be looking for solutions along RDF-ish lines. 
(Speech-Acts anyone?). --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Might be better to say, the sender intends to assert the content of.... But the main problem with this is that 'the content of' isn't clear for RDF, or indeed for any assertional formal language. 
Suppose I were to publish some FOL axioms, for example, which tie their meanings down a lot more tightly than RDF does; what would it mean to say that I was asserting their content? 
They have no particular content in the real world; it depends on how one interprets the symbols that occur in them. 
Maybe what we need to say here is that the content of any published RDF is intended to take into account all agreed meanings of any URIs that occur in the RDF, and that such meanings may be specified by communal, social or legal agreements made externally to RDF itself; and that the occurrence of any URI in any asserted RDF shall be deemed to constitute a public use of that URI (or whatever the appropriate legal phrase is: is there a lawyer in the house?), and that any conclusions involving such usage that are validly entailed by any published RDF shall be understood to have the same legal force, and to incur all obligations and rights accruing from said publication, that they would if they had been included explicitly in the publication. 
Almost true (not quite exactly when bNodes occur), but unhelpful. 
Definitely not true, in general. 
? 
Incomprehensible. 
The meaning of {:x rdf:type :c} is that :x is in the class :c.

I copied Tim's points from IRC and worry I did so rather imprecisely. 
He states them himself in: comments/2001OctDec/0324.html Hope this helps, [ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/
