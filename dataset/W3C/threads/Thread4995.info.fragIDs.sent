<s> Using a b:bookmarkedBy property would give the queryer a chance to know immediately if it's the sort of data that it's interested in persuing.  </s>
<s> For efficiencies sake, people may start to flatten their data structures so that they will all be loaded when the client asks for one level of properties away from foo.  </s>

<s> :browserProfile ?o)  </s>
<s> collect (?annotation ?p ?o)  </s>
<s> If we wanted an approach like this we'd have to make sure that the server was not limited by the query lanuage specification to only returning properties with foo in the subject and :browserProfile in the predicate -- that it was free to return some annotations and some ISBN info and whether it goes well with a cabernet... -eric office: +81.466.49.1170 W3C, Keio Research Institute at SFC, Shonan Fujisawa Campus, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-8520 JAPAN cell: +1.857.222.5741 (does not work in Asia) (eric@w3.org)  </s>
