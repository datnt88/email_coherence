I can't seem to locate indepth information about the coding of accessible drop down menus -- accessible to screen readers. 
Anyone have any pointers? 
I need to brush up on techniques. 
Thanks, Mike Mike Paciello WebABLE, Inc. Jim Ley has written an accessible drop-down menu. 
His current version is linked from here: please fell free to comment. 
thanks Mike, ps: if you want to comment on the whole document please do! 
jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web" A more old, but equally accessible model, is the one that I use in the pages of the Sidar: http://www.sidar.org 
Regards, Emmanuelle directory Hello, I tested the two examples of drop down menus with JAWS and Home Page Reader. 
The one mentioned by Jonathan is very accessible with keyboard bu not usable with JAWS in virtual PC cursor mode. 
This mode is the default mode and most users don't know how to bypass it. 
The user have to be warned to deactivate the virtual PC cursor because without warning, he don't know that some menu item are missing. 
In HPR all the menu items are their but at the end of the page. 
It's not very bad but a bit confusing. 
Because the problem described with JAWS and because the large market share of JAWS between screen readers, I think this example can't be qualified like "accessible". 
The second example mentioned by Emmanuelle, works correctly and JAWS and HPR see all item of the menus but because the page is reloaded, JAWS and HPR restart reading of the page from the beginning. 
It's an important drawback. 
If somebody have other examples to share. 
I'd very like to have a technique for accessible drop down menus to suggest to web developers that I have to traine for web accessibility. 
Thanks Jean-Marie D'Amour, M.Ed.
