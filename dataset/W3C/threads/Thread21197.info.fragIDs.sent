<s> Hi This is to report a small issue with scrolling.  </s>
<s> To see it please open in your Windows 2000 PC :-) in a window with a height so you can see up to the "Open Source" H2 title.  </s>
<s> Now press the cursor down key until the end of the page.  </s>
<s> Last step is to scroll back with page up 2 ot 3 times: a blank area appears now at the top of the page.  </s>
<s> I enclose an image of the effect in a rather small window for the Windows-challenged Amaya users who want to see it.  </s>

<s> Amaya doesn't format the whole document when it's a large document.  </s>
<s> So when you scroll down and up, Amaya frees the undisplayed formatted part and regenerates the new displayed part.  </s>
<s> Doing that, it has some problems when it reaches the top of the document.  </s>
<s> It could allocate too many space and a blank area appears at the top of the page.  </s>
<s> One solution should be to format the whole document, but that will decrease the editing performances.  </s>

<s> Yes, I have noticed, specially when there are two or more tables.  </s>
<s> The solution is to check if the beginning of the document is being displayed and if yen then set it at the top of the window, unconditionally.  </s>
