Hi Gary, You could do: xforms:setvalue ref="/point to yout xsd:date node" value="now()" ev:event="xforms-ready"/ Then the node will be updated after the external source has been read and the node will be editable from the UI. 
If the node should have the now() value staticly you could make a bind xforms:bind nodeset="/point to yout xsd:date node" calculate="now()"/ The it will always have the datetime from when the latest xforms-rebuild event occured. 
Best regards, David Gary Stewart gary@deltagreen.co.uk 18-03-04 7:11 I've been attempting to use the now() function to populate an element with today's date, however the instance data is loaded from an external source and I can't seem to set it so that as the data is read in the now function is invoked and the xsd:date is populated with the current date. 
Is there something obvious I'm missing? 
Thanks, Gary Thank's for that. 
It took me a while to get it working but as I added another event and that didn't work either I realised that I used the event namespace http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-events/ not where I got the former from. 
Works like a treat now. 
Many thanks, Gary Greetings, I keep being told by people who haven't started using XForms that it is not proven technology yet, because no one is using it, there is no browser support, Microsoft aren't implementing, it doesn't slice bread straight or make a good cup of coffee, and so on and so forth. 
When I talk to vendors they tell me that they have customers live today, who think that XForms is actually more useful than sliced bread. 
Well, I have to do a short presentation at a conference next Tuesday, in front of a business audience representing a large chunk of the UK life insurance industry. 
They will be there to hear business justification for looking at XForms. 
The question will come up, "Why should we adopt XForms when no one else has?" and I expect the person asking might look a little smug as they sit back and await the answer. 
So, implementors and vendors, I will redirect the question to you in advance. 
How many organisations are using your products today for mission critical applications? 
Please reply to me direct. 
If I get enough replies to this question (unlikely I guess), I will do a quick sum and, good or bad, I will post the answer. 
If those who reply could give some indication as to customer size, or application size that would add interest. 
If I don't post again on this subject, assume that either I was killed in a tragic accident involving an XForms model, a bread slicing machine and coffee maker, or I didn't get enough replies, or I forgot.

Greetings, we integrated XForms in one of our frameworks for web-applications. 
We use X-Smiles 0.82 as browser and with the help of CSS the optical representation is good.
