<s> I must take exception here - not with the advantages of making security protocols easy to analyse, but with the implicit assertion that SSL - and in particular the RSA based authentication/key exchange - are easily analysed.  </s>
<s> As presented in the current RFC, SSL v3 is just about the most complex security protocol I have ever looked at.  </s>
<s> Frankly, I'm baffled by this assertion.  </s>
<s> Yes, SSL v3 is somewhat more complex than some other security protocols, but I don't think it is particularly resistant to analysis.  </s>
<s> Bruce Schneier and David Wagner have performed an analysis of the protocol, and their paper contains no such complaints.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen the paper analysing SSL - do you have a reference ?  </s>
<s> I'd like to have a look.  </s>
<s> I am sure some of the problems stem from the description in the Internet Draft, which is not the most clear or concise.  </s>
<s> It would be useful to see a formal description and proof of the protocol - eg using BAN logic or similar.  </s>
<s> The problems I have with the protocol are: Challenges and identities are not signed explicitly, but rather they are mixed up with the hashes of other parameters.  </s>
<s> Challenges and identities are not even together in the same message.  </s>
<s> Identities are only in the protocol by virtue of the certificate.  </s>
<s> "Indeterminacy" of what is being signed - the security of the protocol seems to depend on the certificate verify messages which sign the hash(es) of all previous messages in the protocol - which vary depending on whether each party has a certificate etc. Complexity of deriving the key from the "pre-master secret".  </s>
<s> What is the point of this ?  </s>
<s> It doesn't add to the randomness of the key.  </s>
<s> Since you say that it is easily analysed, maybe you could summarise the protocol in a dozen lines, and describe which parameters are critical for security, and how replay and man-in-the-middle attacks are thwarted ?  </s>
<s> There is an obvious man in the middle attack when the server has no certificate since client authentication is expressly forbidden in this case.  </s>
<s> Where is this stated explicitly ?  </s>
<s> If SSL is supposed to be a general protocol, why doesn't it support authenticated clients to unauthenticated servers ?  </s>
<s> I would very much like to see SSL support different (and simpler) authentication mechanisms.  </s>
<s> Many have already been standardised - X.509 being a notable example.  </s>
<s> SSL does use X.509v3 certificates.  </s>
<s> What kind of different authentication mechanisms are you talking about?  </s>
<s> X.509 also defines an authentication exchange which can provide single or mutual authentication. 1 2 or 3 message protocols are defined - depending on whether single or mutual authentication is needed, and whether synchronised clocks are used.  </s>
<s> The protocols have been analysed formally (in the process a weakness was found which has now been corrected).  </s>

<s> Actually it does.  </s>
<s> The "client" can just handshake as a server, and the "server" can handshake as a client.  </s>
<s> There is nothing that requires the side that does the "accept()" call to be the server in the handshake.  </s>
