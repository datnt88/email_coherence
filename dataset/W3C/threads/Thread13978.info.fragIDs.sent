<s> I think that it would make sense to include recommendations concerning the usage of the lang attribute and about multi-lingual websites.  </s>
<s> It is clear from the HTML4.0 spec.  </s>
<s> that if some text is marked in some human language then it should be rendered in that language.  </s>
<s> It seems rather vital for a speaking browser.  </s>
<s> (are there any multi-lingual screen readers nowadays?) Also writing a multilingual page with alternating paragrahs (or in two columns) in English and French could be a usability disaster in speach medium.  </s>
<s> (it is quite usability reducing in visual medium as well) So I would add something like that: 1. (recommended) For documents which include only text in one language, specify the language with the lang attribute in the HTML element.  </s>
<s> 2. (required) For documents which are primerly in one language, but contain some text in other languages, specify the language with the lang attribute in the HTML element, and specify the language of text in other languages using the lang attribute in the appropiriete elements.  </s>
<s> 3. (required) (interim?) Avoid documents that duplicate all/most information in more than one language.  </s>

<s> Nir is right about support for multiple languages.  </s>
<s> I recall being told things like LINK REL="alternate" LANG="XX" was how to specify full alternate pages, but I don't know whether it really works - when I tried it I couldn't win. the Internationalisation thing ought to have a tie-in to WAI issues, perhaps particularly though the EO group as well as being included in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> But I have found ti difficult to make things work, and being an English speaker I have not often needed to - it seems simpler usually to exercise my rusty languages than my browser.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> This is the situation where alternative pages should be used, I think.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the use of databases, XML, etc are going to provide a lot  </s>
<s> of the front-end for multilingual material.  </s>
<s> Which makes it a UA problem.  </s>

<s> On several occasions I have mentioned, in this forum, the need for multilingual texts to be marked up appropriately with the LANG attribute.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this suggestion has not yet been included in the guidelines, and I fail to understand why.  </s>
<s> It is essential for both braille translation software and speech synthesizers that the language always be clearly identified.  </s>
<s> TO:charlesn@sunrise.srl.rmit.edu.au  </s>
<s> Clearly, you need both UAs and authors here.  </s>
<s> If authors specify the language it helps UAs to identify it.  </s>
<s> But if UAs don't do anything with this information, it too bad.  </s>
<s> I think that both Navigator and Explorer have a menu in the preferences that allows the user to specify priorety in languages for the case alternate documents in several languages exist.  </s>
<s> I don't know if it works or not.  </s>

<s> It works in Netscape, and in the version of MSIE4 that I'm currently using.  </s>
<s> And in Lynx, of course, and doubtless in other browsers too.  </s>
<s> In earlier versions of MSIE, I wasn't able to find a browser choice independently of the Windows language configuration.  </s>
<s> At risk of stating the obvious: the browser only sends the user choice to the server.  </s>
<s> You can check what your browser is sending by accessing this URL: and looking for a line like this in the environment: HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE=en-GB,en,de,fr It's then up to the server to process this setting in conjunction with the available document languages, and send the one that best matches the user request.  </s>
<s> Apache, for example, can be configured to do that.  </s>
<s> (This has implications for caching, I should add.) all the best  </s>
<s> Alan explained that the browser needed to send a message about languages to the server, which could then send the right language back to the browser.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the server needs to be configured to do this.  </s>
<s> My problem is that a lot of stuff I do is on CD-ROM - it relies on the browser directly following the LINK.  </s>
<s> this works for stylesheets, and it would be good if it worked for alternate languages as well, so maybe it is a UA issue.  </s>
<s> That would remove the problem for a user that they have to rely on an appropriate server set-up, as well as the problem with working on local files rather than http: web-sourced stuff.  </s>

<s> The disability access issue is that if a document in English has a sentence in Spanish, the sentence in Spanish should be rendered in Spanish and not in English.  </s>
<s> For User agents: For example a speaking browser that can read both English and Spanish should interpret the lang attribute and read the text correctly.  </s>
<s> For authors: authors should specify the language of the Spanish phrase in the above example using the lang attribute to allow correct rendering.  </s>
<s> I would say that it is an accessibility issue, since it seems more important in speech medium than in visual medium.  </s>
<s> Paradoxically, there have been many more discussions about this in the stylesheet mailing list concerning how quotation marks are presented visually in different languages.  </s>

<s> That's a trivial example of how language affects the sighted, but it's more important in other aspects, notably the display of Asian ideographs.  </s>
<s> In Unicode, the same code points, or numbers, are used for the "Han unification" ideographs, regardless of whether the character is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.  </s>
<s> The language is necessary in order to display the correct picture.  </s>
<s> So this is definitely an accessibility issue, but is by no means restricted in its importance to access.  </s>
<s> It's yet another curb cut.  </s>
