<s> Hi, I'd like to report this bug, which I've been observing occasionally.  </s>
<s> Sometimes, it is not possible to delete a selected region containing MathML.  </s>
<s> I attach an example.  </s>
<s> The problem appears to depend on the relationship between the undeletable region and the rest of the document.  </s>
<s> I say this because in the case of this example, if one copies and pastes the undeletable region into a new blank document, it is possible to delete it in the new document.  </s>
<s> So its undeletability appears to be connected with other parts of the document.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, other regions of this example document are deletable.  </s>
<s> Also, slightly changing the extent of the selected region makes it deletable.  </s>
<s> Thus I attach the entire document, rather than just the undeletable region.  </s>
<s> OK here is the example.  </s>
<s> Open the attachment in Amaya and select the region between: "Bell states:" and "If lambda is unknown, the probability distribution" *inclusive*.  </s>
<s> You should find that hitting backspace or delete or selecting the Delete menu item has no effect.  </s>
<s> If I enlarge the extent of the selection, say to include sections 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.5,  </s>
<s> I can delete it fine.  </s>
<s> This problem has been a nuisance for me before, as it has resulted in me having to delete more than I want to in order to delete something!  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>

<s> It's just due to an inconsistent selection in the tree structure.  </s>
<s> You have to hit the key Escape (F2 on windows) to request Amaya to  </s>
<s> generate the corresponding consistent selection then you will be able  </s>
<s> to remove it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the response.  </s>
<s> A few thoughts:  </s>
<s> i) As the developer this is very obvious to you.  </s>
<s> But as a user, it was completely  </s>
<s> non-obvious!  </s>
<s> I had absolutely no way of knowing that I should hit Esc.  </s>
<s> All I could see was that Amaya wasn't deleting what I asked it to.  </s>
<s> At the very least, it would be a good idea for Amaya to display an informative messsage box in this situation.  </s>
<s> ii) I don't believe I was trying to do anything unreasonable in this situation.  </s>
<s> I wanted to delete a particular block of text, and Amaya wouldn't let me.  </s>
<s> Hitting Esc means I end up deleting more than I want to.  </s>
<s> If Amaya is a WYSIWYG editor, surely there shouldn't be such a concept as an "inconsistent selection", as this is forcing users to take account of the underlying HTML/MathML.  </s>
<s> iii) If I enlarge the selection, delete it, and then Undo the deletion, I can then delete the area I originally wanted to delete.  </s>
<s> This suggests to me that it should have been possible to delete that area in the first place... Sorry to be a pain, but I am using Amaya a lot, and am just putting the user's point of view!  </s>
<s> Joe  </s>
<s> Hi Joe, You're completely right, we have to fix the problem.  </s>
<s> I just tried to explain the cause of the trouble and a possible solution for  </s>
<s> you.  </s>
<s> Thanks Irene, knowing the Esc trick will certainly help for the time being.  </s>
<s> Joe  </s>
<s> Hi Joe, The bug is fixed now.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Thanks! Joe  </s>
<s> Hi At the end of this I am sending a valid HTML file that contains only the text "New-user.htm"  </s>
<s> within a table.  </s>
<s> With Amaya 4.3.2  </s>
<s> (under win95) that text gets hyphenated as: New-user.h-  </s>
<s> tm It sure looks like a bug.  </s>
<s> Best regards Jos?  </s>
