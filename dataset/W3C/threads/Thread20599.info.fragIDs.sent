Hi, I'd like to report this bug, which I've been observing occasionally. 
Sometimes, it is not possible to delete a selected region containing MathML. 
I attach an example. 
The problem appears to depend on the relationship between the undeletable region and the rest of the document. 
I say this because in the case of this example, if one copies and pastes the undeletable region into a new blank document, it is possible to delete it in the new document. 
So its undeletability appears to be connected with other parts of the document. 
Furthermore, other regions of this example document are deletable. 
Also, slightly changing the extent of the selected region makes it deletable. 
Thus I attach the entire document, rather than just the undeletable region. 
OK here is the example. 
Open the attachment in Amaya and select the region between: "Bell states:" and "If lambda is unknown, the probability distribution" *inclusive*. 
You should find that hitting backspace or delete or selecting the Delete menu item has no effect. 
If I enlarge the extent of the selection, say to include sections 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.5, 
I can delete it fine. 
This problem has been a nuisance for me before, as it has resulted in me having to delete more than I want to in order to delete something! 
Thanks, 
Joe 
It's just due to an inconsistent selection in the tree structure. 
You have to hit the key Escape (F2 on windows) to request Amaya to 
generate the corresponding consistent selection then you will be able 
to remove it. 
Thanks for the response. 
A few thoughts: 
i) As the developer this is very obvious to you. 
But as a user, it was completely 
non-obvious! 
I had absolutely no way of knowing that I should hit Esc. 
All I could see was that Amaya wasn't deleting what I asked it to. 
At the very least, it would be a good idea for Amaya to display an informative messsage box in this situation. 
ii) I don't believe I was trying to do anything unreasonable in this situation. 
I wanted to delete a particular block of text, and Amaya wouldn't let me. 
Hitting Esc means I end up deleting more than I want to. 
If Amaya is a WYSIWYG editor, surely there shouldn't be such a concept as an "inconsistent selection", as this is forcing users to take account of the underlying HTML/MathML. 
iii) If I enlarge the selection, delete it, and then Undo the deletion, I can then delete the area I originally wanted to delete. 
This suggests to me that it should have been possible to delete that area in the first place... Sorry to be a pain, but I am using Amaya a lot, and am just putting the user's point of view!

Hi Joe, You're completely right, we have to fix the problem. 
I just tried to explain the cause of the trouble and a possible solution for 
you. 
Thanks Irene, knowing the Esc trick will certainly help for the time being.

Hi Joe, The bug is fixed now. 
Irene. 
Thanks! Joe 
Hi At the end of this I am sending a valid HTML file that contains only the text "New-user.htm" 
within a table. 
With Amaya 4.3.2 
(under win95) that text gets hyphenated as: New-user.h- 
tm It sure looks like a bug. 
Best regards Jos?
