Hi Jos here is my latest effort. 
I sttill need to: - add text capturing your point about incomplete reasoners - describe manifest file - sort out some problems to do with references - sort out some problems to do with some proposed tests - add manfiest entries for other tests on the web site - add at least one inconsistent test and at least one consistent test - the tests you described to the WG yesterday don't seem to be on the web site. 
Would you like me to RDF/XML ise them? 
I have checked the files into CVS, but not onto my live server. 
Given the deadline, could you look at this version and give me any comments. 
I will send you a further update later today with an indication as to what has changed. 
A specific question, see section B.1, do you agree with me (delete the text) or Peter (who asked for this)? 
If the former I will change "Jeremy disagrees" to "The editors disagree". 
Also do you want a home page URL? 
Jeremy right, that Proof EntailmentTest | Reasoner Found Positive | OK Found Negative | NOT OK (unsound) Not Found Positive | OK for *incomplete* reasoner Not Found Negative | OK thinking about Jim's cardinality tests I think we can have a nice example of a consistency test for maxCardinality, I will try that today BUT what about minCardinality wouldn't it make sense to have also a kind of completeness test? 
I know that this sounds dangerous, but how else could one make sense of a minCardinality test? 
I mean something like given these facts, is this complete w.r.t. that particular property (in this case minCardinality) right, I have some examples as well in no, I have them here and I will check them in into w3ccvs sorry about that, but I was confused... checked that out, is OK comments. 
I has I will start reading now... text) disagrees" OK, jumped to that one and I agree with your text OK, take --------.

Hi Jos here's my latest lots more tests in it. 
I've tidied them up: the remaining "wrong descriptions" errors are a software bug to do with XML Literals in my code. 
I've added some text which I hope meets your incomplete reasoner requirement. 
I've added Manifest description section. 
References looking OK Other text is unchanged. 
I need to add an acknowledgement to my host here in Italy. 
Time permitting I will add the range examples that came up under issue 5.3. 
Again, I've checked stuff in, but not updated my server. 
Time permitting I wish to revisit the descriptions of the approved (Inverse)?Functional 
tests to take on board Peter's semantic/syntax points. 
Jeremy Hi Jeremy, after I just replied that the attachment was probably not what you intended, I was able to get the here attached document from my local server after w3ccvs checkout (wonderful, isn't it that Web) well, I haven't found them in there but I guess that's easy to fix that's definitely meeting what I intended or it's a positve entailment ;-) looks fine to me what about filling the "Missing ref."s with [RDF Test Cases] http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/ [Dublin Core] http://dublincore.org/documents/ 
[N3] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html Notation3 Primer - a quick introduction to semantic web using cwm and n3 Tim Berners-Lee, Dan Connolly or w.r.t. to OWL pointing to good idea 5.3. 
right, I had to read that more carefully points. 
yes, time doen't permit very much Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
I'm getting there. 
Thanks for the ref suggestions. 
I think the descriptions of your test cases can be improved. 
At the moment, the description is essentially echoing the test as triples. 
How about: owl:intersectionOf 001 The order of the classes in an code intersectionOf /code construct is unimportant. 
(that understates the amount of time we have spent on that problem!) I notice that your test uses only the weak semantics - more of that on the mailing list and at the f2f. 
We will need to have also a strong semantics test, and show a decision, which I suspect will be for the entailment. 
owl:maxCardinality 001 A code prop /code with code maxCardinality /code of two cannot take three distinct values on some code sb1 /code . 
owl:maxCardinality 002 A code prop /code with code maxCardinality /code of two cannot take three distinct values on some code sb1 /code . 
In this example, one of the three values is implicit. 
owl:TransitiveProperty 001 A simple illustration of transitivity. 
owl:unionOf 001 A union is a superclass of its parts. 
owl:unionOf 002 code owl:unionOf /code behaves quite like set theoretic union. 
Justification, we will need test cases that illustrate any divergence from this. 
e.g. a strong semantics one, where we comment on which semantics are being used. 
Note XHTML can be copy-pasted straight into the editor; the manifest has xmlns="XHTML". 
I expect to have final draft to you for your approval this morning. 
Assuming you can OK it at the RDF Core telecon. 
Jeremy Maybe the final version ... do you have updates? 
I hope its own url is right! 
Jeremy Jeremy, I had half a holiday and am only finding now your message I fully agree with your much improved comments and have immediately put them into the files (however manually) and have them checked into w3ccvs I also recompiled the wowg and now got a nice document (*) however, still without those testcases Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/

Jeremy If you want immediate update from cvs you need to restart tomcat. 
Otherwise it only checks once an hour.
