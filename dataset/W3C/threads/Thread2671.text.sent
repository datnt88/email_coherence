Hi, RFC2616 says: 4.2 Message Headers Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]. 
It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma. 
The order in which header fields with the same field-name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded. 
I'm building a HTTP UserAgent with PHP and now i'm dealing with this multiple message-header fields. 
If my UserAgent receives such multiple fields, should it combine these fields into one or should it keep the multiple fields and send it to the server (if present in a request)? 
The problem behind this is the storage of this header fields. 
Currently i have an associative array that does something like Accept = array(text/html, image/*) if there was Accept: text/html Accept: image/* but when someone wants the value of Accept i only want to return a string and therefor i only return the first value i.e. text/html which does not meet someones expactation.

Some browsers don't handle multiple cookies in a Set-Cookie header field (i.e. they require a separate header field for each cookie to be set). 
Furthermore, because a number of sites use broken cookies which contain commas in the value, parsing a combined Set-Cookie header field can be a little tricky. 
Cheers, Ronald Ok, good to know, thanks.
