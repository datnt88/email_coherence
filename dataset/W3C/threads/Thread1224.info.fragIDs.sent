<s> Markus, I'm not necessarily opposed to registration of SCSU, but I think there is a problem here.  </s>
<s> Additional Information: SCSU is a Character Encoding Scheme for Unicode/ISO 10646 that allows significant size reduction of text compared to UCS Transformation formats.  </s>
<s> SCSU does not meet the definition of a "Character Encoding Scheme" as defined in Unicode Technical Report #17, Character Encoding Model.  </s>
<s> UTR #17 states: "SCSU ... should also be conceived of as [a] transfer encoding syntax.  </s>
<s> [It is] not appropriate for registration to get [a] formal charset identifier, since the compressed forms are not unique, but depend on the sophistication of the compression algorithm."  </s>
<s> I don't know whether this would absolutely disallow a charset registration for SCSU, but we should be clear that while SCSU *de*coding is uniquely defined, SCSU *en*coding is not.  </s>

<s> I missed this part of UTR #17.  </s>
<s> I am reading it now.  </s>
<s> UTR #17 defines: "A transfer encoding syntax is a reversible transform of encoded data which may (or may not) include textual data represented in one or more character encoding schemes."  </s>
<s> (Emphasis in the Report on the first instance of "data".) It then lists as examples base64, uuencode, gzip, and others.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, SCSU is designed specifically for Unicode text, not general data.  </s>
<s> The aspect of compression does not, according to the rules of IANA registration and unlike stated in UTR #17, preclude the use as a charset.  </s>
<s> SCSU defines encoding choices for Unicode code points.  </s>
<s> It does offer choices, but it essentially encodes Unicode text.  </s>
<s> Again, from UTR #17: "A character encoding scheme is a mapping of code units into serialized byte sequences."  </s>
<s> It is not a one-to-one mapping, but it is a well-defined, reversible mapping - unless you define "mapping" very closely.  </s>
<s> See also the charset examples below.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, SCSU is closer to a CES than a TES.  </s>
<s> At best (worst?),  </s>
<s> SCSU is in a gray zone between the CES and TES definitions, or it is both.  </s>
<s> While this is true, SCSU does fit the definition of a charset: "... a method of converting a sequence of octets into a sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> ..." (From the draft registration procedure, section 2.3 "Charset".)  </s>
<s> This does not require uniqueness.  </s>
<s> Also, other charsets do not provide uniqueness: - ISO-2022 allows the same character encoded in as many different ways as are accessible with different embedded charsets.  </s>
<s> ISO-2022 is also stateful.  </s>
<s> - EUC-TW duplicates the entire plane 1 of CNS 11643-1992 in Code set 1 (2 bytes/char) and Code set 2 (4 bytes/char).  </s>
<s> (Reference: Ken Lunde's "CJKV Information Processing", pp. 162-164) I find SCSU highly useful for something like XML.  </s>

<s> (This is an updated proposal that incorporates feedback from Kenneth Whistler, Harald Tveit Alvestrand, and Martin J. D?rst.) Charset name: SCSU Charset aliases: (none, except for the implicit csSCSU) Suitability for use in MIME text: No Published Specification: Unicode Technical Report #6 "A Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode" CCS &amp; CES: The SCSU charset is a combination of the Unicode and ISO 10646 Coded Character Set (CCS) with the Character Encoding Scheme (CES) specified in the above document.  </s>
<s> It covers exactly the UTF-16-reachable subset of ISO 10646.  </s>
<s> SCSU can also be classified as a Transfer Encoding Syntax (TES), but one specifically designed for Unicode/ISO 10646.  </s>
<s> ISO 10646 equivalency table: Same as specification.  </s>
<s> Additional Information: SCSU is an encoding (CES/TES) of Unicode/ISO 10646 that allows significant size reduction of text compared to UCS Transformation formats.  </s>
<s> It approximates the size of text that is otherwise achieved with language-specific charsets while encoding all of Unicode (up to U-0010ffff).  </s>
<s> SCSU is byte-based, which helps further, traditional compression (LZW etc.).  </s>
<s> It is stateful and uses all byte values including NUL. CRLF may or may not be represented by 0x0d 0x0a depending on the encoder and the text.  </s>
<s> Encoders can be trivial by emitting one command byte (0x0f) followed by the text in UTF-16BE.  </s>
<s> Fairly simple encoders yield good results with average text of any length.  </s>
<s> Decoding is simple and requires no mapping tables.  </s>
<s> If no control characters other than NUL, TAB, CR, and LF are used, then text in US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1 is already valid SCSU text.  </s>
<s> There is a Unicode signature byte sequence defined (0e fe ff, see specification).  </s>
<s> SCSU is of no use for applications that require a canonical representation of text.  </s>
<s> It is not suitable for process-internal use.  </s>
<s> This is an intentional part of its design.  </s>
