<s> I am wondering why the following functions are not included:  </s>
<s> Obviously there are hundreds (thousands!) of functions that we could have  </s>
<s> included but have not.  </s>
<s> We have consciously tried to keep the library as small as possible, and in fact some people complain that it is already much too large compared with XPath 1.0.  </s>
<s> 1) Equivalents to the Java indexOf() and lastIndexOf() operations on strings.  </s>
<s> A typical use case of the latter is to extract the last part of a path, e.g. "/this/is/my/path".  </s>
<s> In this particular case, there is a simple workaround, for example: fn:tokenize("/this/is/my/path", "/")[last()] This is potentially less efficient than a function implementing a dumb lastIndexOf() though, and there are arguably cases where you just need the index in the string rather than a token.  </s>
<s> With string handling functions, we have been guided by experience with XPath 1.0.  </s>
<s> There are a few things that XPath 1.0 users find difficult to achieve, and we have plugged most of these gaps.  </s>
<s> In my experience most of the use cases for indexOf() in Java are so that you can then use substring() to do the equivalent of XPath's substring-before() and substring-after().  </s>
<s> More complex string processing in XPath 1.0 requires recursive user-written  </s>
<s> functions, but from what I can see this will very rarely be needed in XPath 2.0.  </s>
<s> If you showed a use case for which there isn't a simple workaround, your case would be more convincing.  </s>
<s> If the worst comes to the worst, you can write indexOf yourself using string-to-unicode and unicode-to-string.  </s>
<s> 2) A regexp function that simply returns a sequence of matching groups.  </s>
<s> I know that XSLT 2.0 provides xsl:analyze-string which provides advanced matching functionality, but given the presence of fn:matches, fn:replace and fn:tokenize in XPath, there is room for such a function in XPath itself.  </s>
<s> Can you provide a use case?  </s>
<s> 3) There is fn:escape-uri, but no unescape-uri.  </s>
<s> Java for example provides an URLDecoder and an URLEncoder.  </s>
<s> This has been requested before, but I'm not aware of any context where unescaped URIs (which are not URIs at all, of course) are needed.  </s>
<s> Do you know of such a context?  </s>
<s> Michael Kay  </s>
<s> I guess the approach I would have chosen would have been to look at existing libraries, for example the Java String and Pattern/Matcher classes, and try to match the functionality available there (which is there most of the time for a reason).  </s>
<s> While substring-before() and substring-after() are useful and mirror each other, they both start searching at the beginning of the string.  </s>
<s> Java's lastIndexOf() starts searching at the end of the string.  </s>
<s> I am not particularly looking for functions returning the position of the searched substring, and I would be happy to have a substring-before() and substring-after() that can also start from the end of the string.  </s>
<s> In my experience cases where you need to search from the end are almost as frequent as cases where you need to search from the beginning.  </s>
<s> 2) A regexp function that simply returns a sequence of matching groups.  </s>
<s> I know that XSLT 2.0 provides xsl:analyze-string which provides advanced matching functionality, but given the presence of fn:matches, fn:replace and fn:tokenize in XPath, there is room for such a function in XPath itself.  </s>
<s> Sure. Let's say my regexp is: "/some-path/([0-9]*)/xyz/([0-9]*)" I want to extract the first group and the second group.  </s>
<s> Java's Matcher  </s>
<s> class gives you access to the matched groups by index, e.g. if my input string is "/some-path/1234/xyz/12", the first group will return "1234" and the second group "12".  </s>
<s> In Java you access them with matcher.group(0) and matcher.group(1).  </s>
<s> The function would looke like this: fn:matching-groups($input as xs:string?, $pattern as xs:string) as xs:string*  </s>
<s> 3) There is fn:escape-uri, but no unescape-uri.  </s>
<s> Java for example provides an URLDecoder and an URLEncoder.  </s>
<s> The idea is to be able to decode an already encoded ("escaped" in the current terminology) URI.  </s>
<s> If you receive a query string from a Web browser, you may need to decode its parameters.  </s>
<s> Typically this task is done by your Web server, but your application may happen to have to handle non-decoded URI parameters.  </s>
<s> In addition to this, there is a reason of symmetry: if you provide a function to encode, you may as well provide a function to decode.  </s>

<s> could  </s>
<s> So let's all just implement the functions of XPath 1.0 (since we need them for backwards-compatibility).  </s>
<s> Then, should we use the Perl functions, or the Java functions, or the C/C++/C# functions, or the SQL-functions or the EXSLT functions and/or...  </s>
<s> The point is that we attempt to design a function library that provides the minimal support necessary to provide interoperability among implementation.  </s>
<s> If you add too many functions, you will not get achieve that and you will add to the delay of the spec...  </s>
<s> Note that there is nothing that forbids us to add more functions later or encourages implementers to provide additional functions in their implementation which then can be used to gather information about their usefulness.  </s>
<s> This then can be used to determine future extensions of the function library...  </s>
<s> Best regards Michael  </s>
<s> Remember that I am just talking about functions operating on strings here.  </s>
<s> But yes, of course, ideally one should look at all of those languages and libraries.  </s>
<s> There will be a lot of overlap between all those anyway.  </s>
<s> Sure. String functions are usually quite easy to implement though, and I doubt that it would be a huge obstacle to building interoperable implementations to add a couple of string functions.  </s>
<s> But the usefulness of many functions can be already determined by looking at what's available in existing function libraries.  </s>
<s> Take XPath  </s>
<s> 1.0 for example.  </s>
<s> It has a starts-with() function, but no ends-with().  </s>
<s> Maybe somebody used that argument back in 1998 / 1999  </s>
<s> that if you added ends-with(), the spec would be delayed and that it would limit interoperability, and that ends-with() is after all not that useful a function anyway.  </s>
<s> But I think that even at the time (almost the prehistory of XML ;-) it was possible to foresee that such a function would be useful, and it would have been possible to build a decent string function library in 1.0 without too much hassle by just looking at what was already in the Java API, for example.  </s>
<s> All I am doing here is to try to avoid repeating the same mistake and then to be stuck for another 4 years with a lacking function library.  </s>
<s> That's for the theory.  </s>
<s> Note that I find the current selection of functions in XPath 2.0 quite good already, but some holes are questionable, which was the point of my initial comment.  </s>
<s> -Erik  </s>
<s> speaking personally (i.e. without any W3C hats on!) I find this use case compelling -- I have always found it frustrating when languages add simple regexp matching without this, especially as every regexp library I've ever used at the programming language level provides the functionality.  </s>
<s> There are lots of functions one might want -- I've often wanted "ends-with" for looking at file extensions in XSLT, for example, but implemented one myself as a named template.  </s>
<s> On decoding URLs and a QUERY_SRING or QUERY_PATH, I suspect you'd also want access to environment variables in order to access the  </s>
<s> query in the first place, and that opens a whole new can of worms.  </s>
<s> So, my take is I agree about the regexp function, but not so much about unescaping URIs and splitting out parameters, I think.  </s>
<s> Best, Liam Liam Quin, W3C XML Activity Lead, liam at w3.org, http://www.w3.org/People/Quin/  </s>
<s> We are 100% in agreement about this one.  </s>
<s> Absolutely not!  </s>
<s> I am simply talking about transforming or querying documents containing encoded URLs.  </s>
<s> URL encoding and decoding functions fit perfectly in a functional language as they do not have any side effect.  </s>
<s> This is true for the current fn:escape-url(), and would be true for fn:unescape-url() (or whatever it is called).  </s>
<s> This is a scenario I hit recently: A Web form based on XForms allows  </s>
<s> the user to enter an URI, possibly with encoded query parameters, for example: %2Fhome%2Fthread.jsp%3Fthread_id%3D21921  </s>
<s> That form is submitted.  </s>
<s> An XForms instance containing that URI is created, and looks like this: my-uri http://example.org/rss?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theserverside.com\  </s>
<s> %2Fhome%2Fthread.jsp%3Fthread_id%3D21921  </s>
<s> /my-uri Now, assume you want to process the XForms instance using XSLT or XQuery (that's what we typically do in the product my company is developing), and that you would like to decode the URL.  </s>
<s> You can easily parse the string with regexps, with fn:tokenize() for example, and obtain the value of the "url" parameter: http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theserverside.com%2Fhome%2Fthread.jsp%3Fthread_id%3D21921 Then you need a function to decode it and get the original URL: Somebody must have argued for the presence of fn:escape-url().  </s>
<s> I argue for the presence of the inverse function, both for reasons of usefulness and of symmetry.  </s>
<s> -Erik  </s>
<s> Thanks, that use case clearly shows me what you mean, and I now see why you want this feature.  </s>
