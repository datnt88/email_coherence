<s> Hi, I tripped across http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html recently.  </s>
<s> Wanted to mention a couple of quickies: The jdbc naming scheme is linked to the Sun documentation for the jdbc class that doesn't seem to even mention the URL scheme.  </s>
<s> A quick search on google reveals what the jdbc url should look like, but doesn't show up any authoritative documentation.  </s>
<s> In GnuCash, we've started using a jdbc-like URL of the form: postgres://some.hostname.com:portno/dbname?option=value&amp;user=username&amp;passwd  </s>
<s> =pwd I beleive that the way we use this syntax is identical to its jdbc equivalent: jdbc:postgres://some.hostname.com:portno/dbname?option=value&amp;user=username&amp;p  </s>
<s> asswd=pwd except that it is understood that the former uses the native postgres format for the wire protocol, whereas the latter uses the jdbc wire protocol.  </s>
<s> I don't know if this usage is too trite to mention, but I thought I'd mention it anyway ... (BTW, we are now actually using a half-dozen private URL schemes in order to control the display an layout of the financial reports.  </s>
<s> I won't describe them here, as they are still evolving.)  </s>

<s> Are all of these new URI schemes really so necessary to create?  </s>
<s> Why not simply use a special text syntax, and, if necessary, stick them in HTTP.  </s>

<s> The vnd.* URL syntax doc is currently in Last Call, and represents a simple and safe way to do this if you feel you really need distinct URL schemes.  </s>
