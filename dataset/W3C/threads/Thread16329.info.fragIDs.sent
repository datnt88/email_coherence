<s> I would love to try.  </s>
<s> But I have some questions relating to blindess, and I suppose visual impairment.  </s>
<s> I am sighted, so these questions are very basic, but are nonetheless important for sighted developers who are trying to build accessible pages.  </s>
<s> These questions assume the person in question has been blind their entire life: 1. Color.  </s>
<s> Is color important if you're blind?  </s>
<s> How do you know what "red" is if you've been blind your entire life?  </s>
<s> I assume people who are color blind will understand shades - correct me if I'm wrong.  </s>
<s> 2. Shapes.  </s>
<s> How do I describe a classic Greecian column?  </s>
<s> Can geometic shapes be used (cylindrical, columnar, etc.)? 3. Distances.  </s>
<s> I imagine distances, either in feet or inches or miles or yards visually.  </s>
<s> I know the drive from my house to work is five miles.  </s>
<s> It takes me 30 minutes to bike it - that's the meaning of five miles to me.  </s>
<s> I can envision the lenght of creek along the route, the 1/4 mile long row of cottonwoods, and the horrible 2 mile stretch along a busy road.  </s>
<s> 4. Metaphors.  </s>
<s> Describing something visual to a sighted person who hasn't seen it is tough enough: we use other visual metaphors to make it easy, and make it work.  </s>
<s> What metaphors exist for the sighted to use when describing something to the blind?  </s>
<s> 5. Finally: sound.  </s>
<s> If we can't easily describe sound to a deaf person, how can we describe images/pictures to a blind person?  </s>
<s> Sorry for all the questions...and they may seem strange in light of my agreement to try and describe the pictures...but I think this is a huge barrier in accessible web design.  </s>
<s> In my experience, most of my fellow webmasters can easily understand accessible web design, and like the idea, with a few minor caveats.  </s>
<s> But we have a real hard time understanding how to convert a visual meaning into a verbal (written) meaning.  </s>

<s> regards, DaveP  </s>
<s> If you go to an Art Gallery exhibition you can look at pictures.  </s>
<s> At many galleries you can also get an audio "guided tour" (usually just a cassette tape, but sometimes a real and knowledgeable person).  </s>
<s> And many exhibitions also have a catalogue, which has pictures of the pictures, and an awful lot of words about the pictures.  </s>
<s> I think there is a message in that somewhere.  </s>
<s> I guess it is the same as the one Bruce is describing - Universal access is often surprisingly useful to the people who could survive without it, despite the fact tht it is critical to only a few people (and a particular aspect may equally be completely unusable for an equal number of people - an audio description helps people who cannot see just as much as it excludes people who cannot hear.  </s>
<s> The goal is to provide the redundancy to cater for both groups, and the benefit spreads to many people in neither group.  </s>

<s> Well, I am sighted, and until you put these pictures on the web, we can take one of your existing photographs.  </s>
<s> I took the liberty of picking your nice Kynn-Cam image tongue2.jpg,  </s>
<s> available from your website at and using The vOICe Learning Edition software I turned it into a slow-motion MP3 soundscape (32K MP3 audio file) Note: if your browser is not properly configured for MP3 files, it may try to show the contents of an MP3 file as text inside the window, which gives binary nonsense and no sound at all.  </s>
<s> In that case, you may have to first save the MP3 file directly to your disk and "run" the file from there.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it is recommended to set your MP3 player to autorepeat, such that you will have all the time to mentally focus on the various details in this complex soundscape.  </s>
<s> The image shows a frontal close-up of Kynn's face, with both shoulders showing in the lower part of the image to the left and right side of the face.  </s>
<s> Kynn's face is just about in the middle of the image and the upper part of the scalp touches the top edge of the image.  </s>
<s> Kynn is looking straight ahead towards the camera, mouth wide open and tongue sticking out (sorry Kynn, but I couldn't resist this one; after all, you did publish this nice photograph on the web, and your comfort here is that there is a similar very famous photograph of Albert Einstein doing the same tongue act, so I think you are in good company).  </s>
<s> Now you will hear a kind of low-pitched rhythm on the left and right side in this stereo sound.  </s>
<s> These are the vertical stripes of the shirt covering Kynn's left and right shoulder.  </s>
<s> The high-pitched tones in the middle of the soundscape are the reflection of the ceiling light on Kynn's hair and scalp.  </s>
<s> The smoother sounds on the far left and right are from the more or less uniform bright background parts.  </s>
<s> On the right side, from the viewpoint of the camera, Kynn is holding up his hand showing palm and fingers, but that is here very difficult to hear out unless you know exactly what to listen for.  </s>
<s> Now we can hear some more details of Kynn's photograph if we zoom in (pressing F4 in The vOICe Learning Edition), and the resulting MP3 sound can be downloaded from the URL Sighted readers can compare this soundscape to the corresponding zoomed-in JPEG image to judge for themselves to what extent the soundscape matches the image content.  </s>
<s> Readers who still lack an MP3 audio player can instead of downloading the above MP3 audio file, download the equivalent but much larger WAV file (176K) from the URL A fairly brief tone with a clear pitch standing out in the left (that is, first) half of the soundscape is from Kynn's white teeth in the upper jaw.  </s>
<s> If you listen carefully, you can even hear some sort of irregularity within this sound, caused by the boundaries between the individual teeth.  </s>
<s> Also, if you concentrate, you can at the very same moment that you hear the teeth, also hear a soft higher-pitched woosh, which happens to be Kynn's nose wich is of course above the teeth.  </s>
<s> On the lower right there is the low-pitched rhythm of the stripes of Kynn's shirt.  </s>
<s> Simultaneously, there is a rather loud higher pitched noise from the bright background that shows between Kynn's face on the left and his hand on the right - again as seen from the camera viewpoint.  </s>
<s> I hope you had some fun from this description.  </s>
<s> Since Kynn took the snapshot using his QuickCam PC camera, the "Kynn-Cam", he should be able to listen to live images for himself using his camera and The vOICe Learning Edition software.  </s>
<s> Also, he could import his existing image files through the "Sonify image files" option in the File menu (or use the Control O keyboard shortcut to the file requester) and play with the various controls for zoom (F4 and arrow keys, and Shift F4 for still more zoom) and slow motion (F3 or Control Alt F3 for very-slow motion) or inverse video (F5).  </s>
<s> For those who are unfamiliar with the rules of image to sound mapping: there are three simple rules in the general image to sound mapping of greyscale camera images, each rule dealing with one fundamental aspect of vision: rule 1 concerns left and right, rule 2 concerns up and down, and rule 3 concerns dark and light.  </s>
<s> The actual rules of the game are 1. Left and Right.  </s>
<s> Video is sounded in a left to right scanning order, by default at a rate of one image snapshot per second.  </s>
<s> You will hear the stereo sound pan from left to right correspondingly.  </s>
<s> Hearing some sound on your left or right thus means having a corresponding visual pattern on your left or right, respectively.  </s>
<s> 2. Up and Down.  </s>
<s> During every scan, pitch means elevation: the higher the pitch, the higher the position of the visual pattern.  </s>
<s> Consequently, if the pitch goes up or down, you have a rising or falling visual pattern, respectively.  </s>
<s> 3. Dark and Light.  </s>
<s> Loudness means brightness: the louder the brighter.  </s>
<s> Consequently, silence means black, and a loud sound means white, and anything in between is a shade of grey.  </s>
<s> All of this means, for example, that a straight bright line on a dark background, running from the bottom left to the top right, sounds as a tone steadily increasing in pitch: ooiieep.  </s>
<s> Two bright lines give two tones.  </s>
<s> Three distinct bright dots sound as three short beeps, and so on.  </s>
<s> Although the rules are simple, real-life images like the photograph of Kynn often give very complex sounds, because there is so much to be seen.  </s>
<s> The direct download URL for the evaluation version of The vOICe Learning Edition executable voice.exe, available for personal use, is while the on-line description of this software can be found at the URL link given below.  </s>

<s> Sure an approach would be very helpful to anyone, but especially to someone who has no vision.  </s>
<s> Having one or more sighted individuals validate descriptive text (audio) is ideal, but such assistance is the exception, not what generally occurs in the real world.  </s>
<s> I would like to target in on an individual who has vision problems and is attempting to access an Inter or Intra net page that uses graphics to convey information.  </s>
<s> Would we normally expect someone with full vision to be assisting the individual who has vision problems?  </s>
<s> The question is "Would this level of effort be expected by everyone who is creating descriptive text to define and explain the use of EVERY graphic image on a web site?".  </s>
<s> To be an effective tool, simple and reasonably objective text must be produced so the non visual user will achieve a level of communication equal to the benefit experienced by a sighted person viewing the same information.  </s>
<s> Is this possible to achieve 100% effective communication 100% of the time even with the best trained observer, most experienced html programer, and very creative web page designer?  </s>
<s> I have been told that the ability to visualize images from descriptive text depends on when the lack of vision occurred - at birth to some period later in life after the individual has had a chance to acquire language skills and associate actual visual images with descriptive words.  </s>
<s> How can a sighted person measure the effectiveness of their efforts to write triple A descriptive text?  </s>
<s> Claude Sweet Education Technologist "Each day provides a another opportunity to acquire new knowledge and perspectives."  </s>
<s> assume as much public media does a 3rd grade level education when writing your descriptions.  </s>
<s> There are many opinions, but the fact is that if you keep it generic and don't refer to in jokes or leave the reader hanging with coloquialisms unless pertenant, it is doable.  </s>
<s> I will dug up urls where this has been done quite well.  </s>

<s> will see to what extent we can find further common ground.  </s>
<s> I am aware that technology is not even half the story here, and we are rapidly approaching the point where we do have a powerful new accessibility option and tool from a technical perspective, but still need to find out and decide for ourselves what we can do or would want to do with it, if anything.  </s>
<s> Indeed there is a need to find better and more convincing answers to Bruce's legitimate questioning of any real world applications.  </s>
<s> Yes, to really learn to see with sound could be painful, it will be very slow, and it might be frustrating at times.  </s>
<s> Moreover, we do not know yet how good people can get at it in the end.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the process of learning a foreign language is also often painful, boring, very slow, and frustrating.  </s>
<s> I have no experience learning to read Braille, or learning to use the cane for safe travel, but I imagine that that too is by no means great fun until after you have mastered it to a certain degree.  </s>
<s> Dots of Braille do not make any sense to me, nor does the Spanish language.  </s>
<s> Somehow we or you work on mastering some of these things, because we think it pays off one way or the other.  </s>
<s> Will learning to see with sound pay off for you?  </s>
<s> I don't know, I cannot promise that.  </s>
<s> Depending on one's personal background, attitude, expectations or interests, it could also be fun for those who had no prior vision, getting an exciting "hands-on" exploration of vision by using a cheap PC camera, experiencing the effects of visual perspective, occlusion, parallax, visual texture, and so on and so forth, but it definitely won't be easy if you want to fully master the interpretation of arbitrary soundscapes.  </s>
<s> Would it be possible to view and treat it more like playing a game?  </s>
<s> The technology has only during the last two years become affordable, through the use of standard PC's and PC cameras, and with worldwide availability of software and information through the Internet.  </s>
<s> We don't have any convincing success stories from users to tell yet.  </s>
<s> The technology is there all right, it provably preserves a lot of visual information in the soundscapes while meeting several key parameters known to limit human auditory perception, it is technically reliable through the use of mass-produced hardware components, it is affordable through cheap $50 cameras and it provides unprecedented access to visual information, but all that information is certainly very dense, and presented in a way that no human being has ever had access to before in history.  </s>
<s> We don't know if the human brain, your brain, my brain, can learn to cope with that, or rather to what extent it can learn to do that, and whether it is really worth all the trouble.  </s>
<s> Now how do we proceed - if we do?  </s>
<s> Ideas are welcome.  </s>
<s> You are quite right, Steve, from the perspective of accessing structured information on the screen.  </s>
<s> This technology was actually developed and meant for accessing arbitrary (unprepared, untagged) visual information, going well beyond the screen, specifically  </s>
<s> for gaining access to the visual information from our real-life local environment by using a camera.  </s>
<s> There is no XML describing my room, my house, my neighbourhood, or XML describing the architecture and art in the city of Rome.  </s>
<s> Now if (and indeed stressing the big "if") we can learn to interpret that arbitrary visual information through sound, we will as a bonus also be able to interpret whatever shows on the screen without additional tagging, just like sighted folks interpret images on web pages.  </s>
<s> For the moment, I can only demonstrate that many things are "audible" within soundscapes, not that they are "understandable".  </s>
<s> How could I show that the Chinese language makes sense and can be learnt?  </s>
<s> Unless you already know Chinese, you probably take it for granted, because many people apparently speak that language, but without such a priori historical evidence available, how does one go about proving things?  </s>
<s> I hope that Kynn will have some nice photographs of buildings or architecture, such that I can discuss how that translates into certain rhythms and sweeps for rows of gates, pillars and such plus the effect of visual perspective on that.  </s>
<s> Again, these soundscapes of complex scenes will currently not make sense to you without my explanation, but with an explanation, the various visual items should at least appear audible, thus illustrating the principles while hopefully adding an element of plausibility to the whole soundscape approach.  </s>
<s> For specific restricted environments such as the graphical user interface of the computer, dedicated solutions will always work much better and easier, just like O C R with synthetic speech for printed text is a lot faster and a lot less painful than trying to figure out printed text from the corresponding soundscapes of printed words.  </s>
<s> So in a sense my use of screen items to illustrate the soundscape technology may be a poor or perhaps even confusing choice, because I'm not proposing to use soundscapes for that, but merely wish to illustrate the generality of visual access offered by jumping into anything visual, even while better solutions do exist for a limited number of specific domains.  </s>
<s> What products are you referring to here?  </s>
<s> GPS systems?  </s>
<s> Electronic compasses?  </s>
<s> Talking signs?  </s>
<s> Even if this became feasible, and machine vision is far away from understanding anything but the simplest of scenes in very restricted environments, there would still remain the fundamental problem of getting either machine censorship to decide for you what is relevant or interesting to mention, or else allow for five minutes to hear all items in a single scene listed.  </s>
<s> With soundscapes, you get the raw uncensored visual information of a scene in one second, today, but the big burden of interpretation is indeed on you, the user.  </s>
<s> After all this "heavy" stuff, it may be useful to note that there are some easy applications of the software as well.  </s>
<s> For instance, it can act as a cheap color identifier: pressing function key F10 lets the software speak the color name of anything in the center of the view, be it a camera image, an imported image file or an image from your TWAIN scanner.  </s>
<s> There is also a built-in accessible graphing calculator for function plotting under function key F8. Sorry for this long-winded reply.  </s>

<s> A free national library program of Braille and recorded materials for people with disabilities is administered by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress.  </s>
<s> Their website url is I believe you are referring to the "Tape Recording Manual" produced by the National Braille Association, Inc.  </s>
<s> The manual provides instruction on procedures and techniques for producing high quality recordings and is an excellent reference manual for use during recording sessions.  </s>

<s> Anything but the simplest geometric shapes was just noise to me.  </s>
<s> That is unavoidable in a general image-to-sound mapping, just like hearing a foreign language does not seem to make any sense at first.  </s>
<s> Still, I have now added a few more simple shape images to The vOICe Sonification Browser web page at These GIF images can be heard by first activating the sonification user agent dialog of The vOICe Learning Edition software by pressing Control U. Next, the above URL can be entered into the dialog, and pressing "Enter" will then parse the web page for image references and page links, which you can subsequently individually select and activate by again pressing "Enter" from another edit box within the same dialog.  </s>
<s> This procedure may take some getting-used-to, but it does allow you to hear any images on the web.  </s>
<s> If you already happen to know the exact URL of an image, you can also enter that image URL directly instead of the URL of a web page.  </s>
<s> The added example images on the above web page now include several variations of squares and circles, but also a photograph of the United States Whitehouse.  </s>
<s> The direct URL for this photograph is so you can also paste this URL directly into the sonification dialog to skip the page parsing and image selection procedure.  </s>
<s> Obviously, you will now not get the ALT-text description that you get from the user agent after it has parsed the HTML page.  </s>
<s> Can you hear out the six pillars at the center of the Whitehouse photograph?  </s>
<s> The sky is bright in this photograph, thus adding a high-pitched noise to the entire soundscape, while the pillars stand out near the center as six very brief noise bursts of somewhat lower pitch.  </s>
<s> Hardly a "real world application", I agree, just an illustration of how one can independently access visual information to at least some extent without a sighted person interpreting things for you.  </s>
