Do to some recent instability, and it being overdue anyways, the annotest server will be upgraded from Debian potato to Debian woody. 
The upgrade will occur at 2200 GMT and should take only a few minutes.

Hi Eric, I am still experiencing problems with the annotation service. 
I can download the annotation index and all the annotations fine, but all authorisation operations fail - why is that ? 
When trying to create an annotation I keep getting HTTP 401 responces ! 
Should I register again? 
(i.e. is my credentials not valid after the upgrade?) --Claus Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong error. 
I was looking for errors with a certain symptom, but they haven't occured since yesterday at 03:21 GMT. 
[Mon Aug 26 03:21:05 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: /var/www/annotations I did an upgrade to last night at 23:50 GMT. 
Could you tell me the exact time you get such an error? 
Then I can look in the error log and see if it gives me a clue. 
I'm sorry, but you seem to have gotten involved in a system bug here. 
Hopefully we'll be able to track it down quickly. 
Let's start with the exact time of a failure and see if we can work with that. 
Again, I'm sorry for the downtime.
