We have been attempting to use the suggested work-arounds and testing them with the beta that Microsoft has made available. 
Unfortunately, we are finding that the results are inconsistent. 
We are seeing the following results: 1. Workstations that never get the prompt, even when the ActiveX is embedded on the first document page 2. Workstations that always get the prompt, even when the ActiveX is contained in a second javascript file 3. Workstations that change between always getting the prompt, and working correctly, depending on how their security settings are changed. 
4. Workstations that work as expected. 
So far, we have 1 workstation that works as expected, and 4 others that do not. 
Does anyone else have similar results, and does anyone know how to get this feedback to Microsoft?

Eolas files motion to enjoin IE Last modified: October 8, 2003, 11:29 AM PDT By Paul Festa Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
Eolas Technologies on Monday filed a motion to permanently enjoin Microsoft's distribution of its Internet Explorer browser amid a flurry of court filings by both sides in the pivotal patent-infringement case. 
Eolas, the sole licensee and sublicensor of a browser plug-in patent owned by the University of California, asked the U.S. District Court in Chicago for an injunction against distributing copies of IE capable of running plug-in applications in a way covered by the Eolas patent. 
"If they're not going to pony up and take a license under the patent, then they shouldn't be using it," Martin Lueck of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi said in an interview. 
The Eolas patent-infringement victory has rattled the Web since it was handed down in August. 
In its verdict, a jury found that Microsoft's IE browser infringed on an Eolas patent that describes how a browser opens external applications of the type produced by Macromedia, Adobe Systems, RealNetworks, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and many other software providers. 
Lueck said Eolas would still permit Microsoft to distribute IE as is, as long as it's being used in conjunction with an application provider or corporate intranet that has an Eolas plug-in license. 
So far, Eolas has not granted any such licenses. 
Lueck also noted that, should the motion be granted, Microsoft still could distribute IE with the plug-in capability disabled. 
Microsoft said it is well on its way to side-stepping both the patent and a potential injunction with an IE alteration it previewed Monday, a version of which it expects to introduce early next year in its next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. 
Lueck and Eolas founder Mike Doyle said they were in the process of examining the IE preview and would not comment on its merits. 
Microsoft on Monday filed motions to set aside the $521 million judgment and to grant it a new trial. 
"As our court papers outlined (Monday), we believe we have substantial grounds for reconsideration by the judge," said Michael Wallent, a general manager in Microsoft's Windows division. 
The Redmond, Wash., software giant asked for the new trial based on several factors, including the unusual proportions of the jury's judgment and the court's refusal to allow discussion of some prior art or similar technology that Microsoft believes predated the Eolas patent and should therefore invalidate it. 
The motions Microsoft filed Monday are prerequisites for appealing the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which the company has pledged to do. 
Microsoft also said it was preparing to challenge Eolas' demands for the court to update the damages award to include the period of September 2001 to the present. 
That could raise the amount of the award by hundreds of millions of dollars, though both sides declined to give a more exact calculation. 
The $521 million award was calculated based on units Microsoft distributed between October 1998 and September 2001. 
Eolas has also calculated that Microsoft owes it about $111 million in interest on that award. 
Even as both sides escalated the post-trial battle with the Monday fillings and Microsoft's IE preview, Lueck called changes to IE unnecessary and reiterated that Eolas was willing to offer Microsoft a paid-up license in exchange for the standing jury verdict plus interest. 
"Eolas and the university are willing to resolve the case on a very reasonable basis," "In view of the amount of the verdict and the accrued prejudgment interest, we'd be willing to give them a paid-up license, if they were willing to take out a license." 
Lueck warned that the offer was not indefinite. 
"That might change in the future if they continue to refuse the deal," he said. 
"The quid pro quo would be settle it now, not force us to litigate for two, three, four years or whatever it is that they have in mind." 
Microsoft contested Lueck's characterization of the offer as "reasonable," and said the company preferred to pursue its workaround strategy than sign a deal. 
"In addition, the changes we rolled out for IE are modest and will not have significant impact on consumers or the Web community as a whole," said Microsoft's Wallent. 
"Based on that, the idea that we would pay more than $630 million to get rid of a single mouse click on a small fraction of Web pages is not something that we're entertaining." 
Wallent based the "more than $630 million" figure on the $521 million verdict and a $111 million interest claim by Eolas. 
I posted a message about this to this list about 24 hours ago; however, it does not appear in the list archives, so here it is again. 
But the short summary is "yes, it's not working right for me either." 
As you all probably know, Microsoft just released a new test version of IE which is "Eolas-compatible", along with advice as to how to modify scripts and applet calls to avoid getting the "Press OK to continue loading this page" popup. 
This method involves document.write()ing the applet or object tag from an external JS file. 
I have put together a small test page which will do this for both Flash and Java: I believe that I have followed the method given in the document released by Microsoft (and Apple, Real and Macromedia.) I have loaded this page in the version of IE downloaded from Microsoft's site. 
One would expect no popups; however, the popups continue to appear. 
I have tested it on a single Win2K machine and also a WinXP SP1 machine. 
Can anyone else confirm that my test still produces popups? 
Is it a problem with my test, or the new IE? Gerv I guess Eolas didn't like Microsoft's work-arounds to the Eolas patent.

Further validation that great patent attorneys are worth their weight in gold. 
One word can make the difference between boom and bust. 
From an information architecture perspective, this IE change is just plain poor. 
There's already too much clicking in many web sites. 
This is not an improvement. 
-Mike And their workaround could, quite possibly, push Eolas into a much lower $$ settlement and license agreement. 
I don't think MS or it's attorney's are stupid. 
My two cents, anyway. 
Jeff Handy - Sr. Digital Media Specialist Bisk Education - Technology Development Dept. Tampa, FL I don't think that the article has anything to do with Eolas' view of the MS workaround. 
It is normal practice for the winner of a patent infringement suit to see a permanent injunction. 
That is their right as the patent holder. 
We did a similar thing when I was at Stac in the Stac v. Microsoft case for infringement of our compression patents (for those who remember Stacker, the disk compression product). 
This was back in 1994. 
We were able to obtain a rather painful injunction that would've required MS and all the PC OEMs to remove their doublespace compression technology from systems on store shelves (not end users). 
We were granted the injunction and then under pressure from the OEMs, we wound up entering settlement negotiations and settled. 
There is still a lot of legal room for MS to run. 
Even if the injunction is granted, MS can request a stay, pending appeal. 
I'm not a lawyer, but have seen some of this first-hand. 
It won't be over for a while, unless Eolas really winds up in what MS considers "reasonable" license territory. 
There's a lot of negotiating going on that we're not seeing and it's happening at the court level.
