<s> Having multiple workpace 'parents' would confuse many things, including current activity, and make workspace semantics for single history selectors very time consuming to enforce.  </s>

<s> Simply that you shouldn't be allowed to create an overlap by binding a member of one workspace to a member of another workspace, or create a binding from a member of a workspace to, say, a parent of the workspace since the workspace would become a member of itself.  </s>
<s> However, since the delta-v spec cannot refer to the binding spec ("other than as work in progress") it should be sufficient to say that workspaces cannot be nested, and leave other binding issues for that work group g  </s>

<s> It is still not clear to me precisely what you are excluding.  </s>
<s> I agree there are some specific scenarios such as a workspace including itself that probably should be excluded.  </s>
<s> I would like to see this pinned down clearly though and not a vague or general precept applied on the basis of a corner case without careful consideration.  </s>
<s> I see no difficulty with workspace members being in more than one workspace and no reason to exclude this with a generic rule at the moment.  </s>
<s> This is not quite the terminology you used which means perhaps such definitions need to be elaborated a little more clearly, or the underlying rationale spelled out.  </s>
<s> I don't currently see any fundamental difficulty with nesting workspaces, and would like the issues clarified before such flattening becomes mandatory.  </s>
<s> This is a fairly significant restriction.  </s>
<s> I agree it is reasonable to leave the mechanics of sharing to a binding spec, as long as the delta-v spec treats such issues as orthogonal.  </s>
