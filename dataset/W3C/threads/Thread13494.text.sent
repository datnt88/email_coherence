Hello, At last week's meeting, William said he would like us to write an EARL abstract to send to the DIWG. 
I have been going through the DIWG archives to determine what they would be using EARL for (the immediate need). 
However, I am still not clear how you envision them using EARL, William? 
It seems that it has been suggested to use EARL instead of CC/PP or to enhance CC/PP for device independent authoring with EARL. 
EARL is intended to describe how content meets (or fails) conformance criteria. 
Are you thinking that it would be used in conjunction with CC/PP to describe conformance preferences? 
e.g., in CC/PP state that I only want content that meets WCAG Level A? Help? 
Here's the trail of interesting bits that I found: DIWG short thread where Shlomit expresses concern that EARL/RDF not general enough for them, that they should use XML. 
Appears to me that they are wanting to use XML to create a single source, not to annotate existing content in any way. 
Therefore, is EARL really a solution? 
i.e. they are talking about a combo of XForms and XHTML-Basic. 
William states: Codification of what the "system requirements" for Web content are can probably be handled by "provider assertions" through something like EARL. 
Sean chimes in with "CC/PP = EARL" Back in March, there was a discussion about XMLGL. 
Some feel that the work of DIWG is to define how to write for a UA while XMLGL/WCAG is to define how to write for the user. 
At this point, Roger Gimson says that CC/PP was built to look at both the user and the device. 
He lists all of the capabilities that the DIWG should consider. 
Seems to be that yes, this should be built on CC/PP. 
My understanding of the purpose of EARL is to record a gauge to accessibility not helping to make something more accessible. 
However, since EARL will be attached to a piece of Web content to annotate which accessibility criteria it meets, I suppose that in describing how it meets it, it could associate accessible alternatives with primary content...but I don't think it is appropriate for authors to rely on EARL to do such things. 
That sounds like a kludge for a language that does not express semantics well...but I guess that's the whole point of RDF... Shlomit and Stephane Maes argue against the overlap between Device independence and accessibility. 
Stephane says the idea of graceful transformation is a key concept, but he does "not believe that to have the document understood by different devices is equivalent to having the document appropriately presented or optimized for interaction through the channel." 
Sean responds about the aims of XMLGL. 
A while back, I wrote this to describe what EARL does. 
Perhaps this could be the basis for an abstract: EARL allows someone to describe how well Web content or a tool follows guidelines or specifications. 
For example, using EARL you can describe if a particular image is used in an accessible way on a Web page. 
Or if a user agent displays SVG images properly. 
"Properly" is defined by the SVG specification. 
"Accessible" is defined in WCAG. 
wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa Wow, neat bit of FOI going on here :-) My understanding of the purpose of EARL is to record a gauge to accessibility not helping to make something more accessible. 
Here's how I understand it:- 1) EARL can be used to rate any resource against a set, or some other brew, of conformance criteria. 
2) Because the reports are made available in RDF, they are mergable, and easily processable. 
EARL provides the standard framework, and the vocabulary; no more, and no less. 
3) These results (i.e. "the report") may be used for any purpose. 
This can include, but is not limited to repair of the resource if it "failed" to meet the conformance criteria, or recommendation of the resource if it "passed". 
As far as CC/PP vs. EARL goes, the two are not in conflict; one cannot be used for the other. 
However, the range of results which are reported by using EARL can easily be used (see points 2 and 3 above) to create some kind of CC/PP profile of the resource. 
For example, if a page passes an XHTML Basic validation test, then that resource can be sent to any browser that accepts valid XHTML Basic in its CC/PP settings. 
One critical point that I should note is that EARL is not *only* for reporting on the accessibility of a resource. 
It allows you to test *any* resource against *any* conformance criteria. 
It would be practically impossible anyway to say constrain people to only making tests about accessibility or device independence anyway, so that's a good thing.

What I am thinking (or what I think I *was* thinking) is that EARL permits authors (actually anyone, not just authors) to make assertions about anything. 
That's pretty general and also seems counter-intuitive else why didn't we have this years ago, etc. One of the classes of assertions could be about one's document/process/condition/+ so that the user's CC/PP could be matched against the EARL assertions and choices made about what to send up the line. 
I guess it's part of a tool suite for content negotiation. 
Now when I start using all those acronyms and buzzphrases I am open to embarrassment because I don't really have a clue as to what all that means, but judging by the reactions of people who do know, I'm not far off base. 
If you examine the "requirements" document it contains a whole lot of stuff that could be the basis for claims made by someone seeking to aver device independence: "You can get your (stock quotes)/(train schedule)/(weather report)/(reservations &amp; tickets) on your cell phone because I have made my site fulfill the DIWG requirement list. 
Your CC/PP indicates that you can handle this." 
Or "the display you use can be used to its limit because I have optimized the style sheet for your hi-res, giant screen system" - etc. Ultimately EARL assertions will be part of the authoring process and will be tied to a report that "indexes" the content via RDF. 
According to my reading of the people who know something about this, it should be Real Soon Now. 
The idea that Google could have an accessibility rating right along with their usual "you may want to download a text version of this if you think PDF sucks" and "you might want this to be translated on the fly if you can't read Swahili", both of which they already do. 
Imagine a Web on which sites are tagged as "508 compliant" or "WAI conformance AA"! 
The glue for this is that if someone claims (via EARL assertion) to be AA compliant, there will be independent sources for other EARL assertions that dispute it when appropriate. 
And Google can handle all this in microseconds. 
It's a Web - not a tree. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
