One of the things that 2518 didn't try to do, because it had to finish in finite time, was to specify exactly how a lock owner is shown. 
One of the problems was there was no way to identify users. 
Now that Access control exists, there is a way to identify users, and the problem can be solved much more nicely. 
I suggest we add an element "principal-URL" to the lock properties. 
The element is defined in the Access control specification, but it would appear inside the "lockinfo" element as part of the "lockdiscovery" property. 
This wouldn't interfere with the "owner" element, which already is used by some clients. 
My approach would be to add this to access control, since that will probably get this useful element standardized sooner. 
"A server MUST include the principal-URL element inside the lockinfo element of a lockdiscovery property value, if the LOCK request that created the lock successfully authenticated as a known principal." 
Lisa Agreed. 
Are there any security concerns here? 
The DAV:owner live property is a MUST property as well, so this doesn't seem to be an issue. 
Julian Interoperability problems with some clients may arise when adding an DAV:principal-URL element to the DAV:lockdiscovery property. 
In the case of Microsoft Office2000 (e.g. Word), I noticed that it depends on the *order* of the child elements inside the DAV:activelock element. 
If the DAV:principal-URL element doesn't come *last*, as in the attached sample PROPFIND response, Word doesn't seem to send correctly the Lock-Token: header. 
This occurs,for example, when creating a new resource: the PUT request following the LOCK request (which initially created a lock-null resource) sends Lock-Token:  .
