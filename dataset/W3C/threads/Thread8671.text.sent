Would anyone be interested in presenting on XML Signature? 
(I generally don't forward or encourage CFPs to the list unless they are relevant to getting information about our work product out.) Forwarded Text ---- C A L L F O R P A P E R S The Internet Society 2001 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS'01) February 7-9, 2001 Catamaran Resort, San Diego, California IMPORTANT DATES Paper Submission due: August 2, 2000 Author Notification: September 27, 2000 Camera-ready final papers due: October 31, 2000 GOAL: This symposium will foster information exchange among researchers and practioners of network and distributed system security services. 
The intended audience includes those who are interested in the practical aspects of network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design and implementation, rather than theory. 
A major goal of the symposium is to encourage and enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technology. 
The proceedings of the symposium will be published by the Internet Society. 
Submissions are solicited for, but are not limited to, the following topics: * Secure Electronic Commerce: e.g., payment, barter, EDI, notarization/timestamping, endorsement and licensing. 
* Intellectual Property Protection: protocols, schemas, implementations, metering, watermarking, other forms of rights management. 
* Implementation, deployment and management of network security policies. 
* Integrating Security in Internet protocols: routing, naming, TCP/IP, multicast, network management, and the Web. 
* Attack-resistant protocols and services. 
* Special problems and case studies: e.g., interplay and tradeoffs between security and efficiency, usability, reliability and cost. 
* Security for collaborative applications and services: tele- and video-conferencing, groupwork, etc. * Fundamental services: authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, authorization, non-repudiation, and availability. 
* Supporting mechanisms and APIs: key management and certification, revocation, audit trails and accountability. 
* Public Key Infrastructure. 
* Integrating security services with system and application security facilities and protocols: e.g., message handling, file transport/access, directories, time synchronization, database management, boot services, mobile computing. 
* Security for emerging technologies: sensor networks, specialized testbeds, wireless/mobile (and ad hoc) networks, personal communication systems, and large heterogeneous distributed systems. 
* Intrusion Avoidance, Detection, and Response: systems, experiences and architectures. 
* Network Perimeter Controls: firewalls, packet filters, application gateways. 
* Virtual Private Networks. 
BEST PAPER AWARD: There will be a best paper award again this year. 
The award will be presented at the symposium to the authors of the best overall paper as selected by the Program Committee. 
SUBMISSIONS: The Program Committee invites both technical papers and panel proposals. 
Technical papers should be at most 20 pages long. 
Panel proposals should be at most two pages and should describe the topic, identify the panel chair, explain the format of the panel, and list three to four potential panelists. 
Technical papers will appear in the proceedings. 
A description of each panel will appear in the proceedings, and may - at the discretion of the panel chair - include written position statements from the panelists. 
Each submission must contain a separate title page with the type of submission (paper or panel), the title or topic, the names of numbers, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, and must specify the contact author in case of multi-author submissions. 
The names of authors, affiliations, and other identifying information should appear only on the separate title page. 
Submissions must be received by August 2, 2000, and must be made via electronically in either PostScript or ASCII format. 
If the Committee is unable to print a PostScript submission, a hardcopy will be requested. 
Therefore, PostScript submissions must arrive well before the deadline. 
Submission information can be found at advance program, and registration information will be available soon at http://www.isoc.org/ndss01. 
Each submission will be acknowledged by e-mail. 
If acknowledgment is not received within seven days, please contact the program Co-chairs as indicated below. 
Authors and panelists will be notified of acceptance by September 27, 2000. 
Instructions for preparing camera-ready copy for the proceedings will be sent at that time. 
The camera-ready copy must be received by October 31, 2000.

As a university, we are obviously used to do such things ;-) and looking at date and location, this seems pretty interesting. 
I do believe that there is place for more than one paper (as I saw Peter already responding) but we might want to coordinate efforts then (bi- or multilateraly) Peter is Well, it's a pretty straightforward CFP (submit a paper and wait and see) that I don't have any direct involvement with; I was qualifying the forward to XML Signature because I was stressing that I only encourage such things if they pertain to getting the XML Signature word out. 
If you or anyone else submits a paper, I think it'd be good karma to ask for comments on it from the WG (or some subset thereof if you don't want it to be public yet) before you present, but that is at your discretion of course.
