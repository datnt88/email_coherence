Same page further down: illustrates the EM with a capital M (not the ?p height). 
I know, the notion of an "em" is thoroughly confused (I will not repeat the result of a web search I did some time ago, it's in Looking through those clippings, and a few more typography books often gives a slightly contradictory impression. 
None that I've found so far take condensed or expanded fonts into explicit consideration when discussing this, and often the exposition on this point is very short. 
It appears, however, that an em should be the (nominal?) width of a capital M. This is also useful for horizontal measures: em space, em dash, and the indent for the first line of paragraph is best measured in em [as width of M, also for bold, expanded, or compressed], as well as table column sizes that one wants to tie to the character width. 
The em, as width of M, is not very useful as a vertical measure. 
There are three, as I see it, vertical relative measures a font USER is interested in: the ?p height, the cap height, and the x height. 
The typeface DESIGNER may well be interested in other vertical and horizontal measures, like the descender to ascender height, but that does not appear at all interesting for the font USER. 
It is especially important to get this done correctly for the web, where for presentation one does not know the EXACT font(s) used, but a font substitution is done. 
Giving the size for a square that is not visible to the ordinary viewer is not a good idea, especially since that square (misnamed, in the confusion, an "em square") has either no fixed relation to the actual glyph sizes, or (Opentype?) focuses on a measure (descender to ascender height) that is *NOT* of major interest to the font USER. 
Let me repeat what I've suggested before on www-style (I don't think it got copied to www-font), with some added usage examples: [Swashes, or swash-like features, don't count in the descriptions below.] 
Horizontal relative measures of interest to the user: em -- width (still!) of an "M" in the current font; useful for specifying first line indent width, the widths of table columns (or even tab stops); NOT particularly useful for vertical measures. 
tmu -- em/18; for convenient (horizontal mostly) adjustment in math expressions (note that math don't use excessively condensed or expanded typefaces, so tmu can there be used vertically too, without surprises). 
Vertical relative measures of interest to the font user: ?p-height -- height from (nominal) descender to top of first level accents on top of capital letters; the recommended minimum baseline distance; NOT particularly useful for horizontal measures. 
H-height -- (nominal) cap height, useful for specifying consistent size, even under font substitution, for ideographic text as well as Latin/Greek/Cyrillic cap only headings. 
x-height -- (nominal) x-height, useful for specifying the size of lowercase dominated text, especially when font substitution is done (count on that it's done, if published on the web). 
Vertical relative measures **NOT** of interest to the font user (in my opinion at least): square size -- (misnamed: em square); no known relation to actual glyph size. 
(Why would any user be interested in this?) descender to ascender -- (square for Opentype); does not take account of accents over capital letters (unless you have a special meaning for 'ascender' in Opentype). 
Another repeat: As I have already suggested for CSS3, font-size could set either the ?p-height, the cap height, or the ex height, as given by a 'mode' parameter (as originally suggested by Ian Hickson). 
For best backwards compatibility, I've suggested that the ?p-height is what is set by default. 
Aside: setting the cap height to the inherited ex height is useful for *fake* small caps. 
Clarification: I see no point in directly setting the em width, so I'm NOT suggesting any such mode for CSS3 "font-size". 
Kind regards /kent k From: Clive Bruton [mailto:clive@typonaut.demon.co.uk] Sent: Monday, January 31, 2000 11:08 PM Subject: Re: What's an em (was RE: Units, font sizing, and zoom suggestion for CSS 3) Karlsson Kent - keka wrote at 31/01/00 17:21 An em was originally the width of an M (swashes don't count). 
Sorry, I think that is (mostly) just a coincidence, an em is a square (ie it has two dimensions, not one) and is defined by the *body* size of a piece of movable type. 
It is scalable since it relates directly to the size of type in question, an exception to this is that in general people measuring by "ems" mean "pica ems" which are 12pt ems (though this doesn't apply in the CSS model). 
In CSS an em is the "font-size", and relatively few use it as yet. 
I haven't seen any good argument for keeping it "as is", other than an unwillingness to correct a mistake and/or to align with TeX. (Call it 'wem', or 'tem' if you like, but then deprecate the current 'em'.) Correcting the definition of an em to what it 1) usually means (width of an M), and 2) what it means (width of an M) in *the* other *major* electronic typesetting context (TeX) should have little impact for most. 
If someone asks for a line-height of 1em, then they should get what they ask for, a line height the same as the width of an M, nothing else. 
This makes no sense. 
In your argument the line height would have no relationship whatsoever to the size of the type. 
Conceivably if one were setting line height for a condensed face it would have to be set in excess of 2.0em, on the other hand for an expanded face it could be as little as 0.5em. 
In both cases the perceived line height would be the same. 
And how would you specify line-height when you mixed different width fonts on a single line, this would happen even if you were setting common combinations like bold and italic styles!? 
The measurement of line-height or em size needs to be explicitly linked to a typeface's size, not its width. 
-- Clive Yes, this is an important point. 
There are at least 2 alternative solutions to your "problem": (1) Don't change the CSS spec, except perhaps to clarify that CSS's font-size and em use the TrueType definition of "em" (in the unitsPerEm field). 
This would require all font vendors to update their fonts if they want users to be able to use them on the Web, where unpredictable substitution occurs. 
Many vendors may not care about the Web, and may leave their old fonts as they are. 
Or they may come up with new designs specifically for the Web. 
Doesn't Adobe have particular fonts for the Web, even with the word "Web" in their names? 
(2) Don't change the fonts, but change the CSS spec and the CSS implementations to use a different definition of font-size and em, e.g. the ?p height. 
This way, the fonts can continue to use some ad hoc interpretation of TrueType's "unitsPerEm" field, and CSS can compensate for this randomness by specifying that the font-size is based on particular actual glyph sizes, e.g. median of x-heights if font-size is set for ex-height. 
The big disadvantage of (2) is that we would be making an incompatible change to CSS, and we already have a number of CSS implementations out there, actually used by users. 
(Unless we define font-size in a clever way, so that old implementations and new implementations use the TrueType em when font-size is specified the normal way, and new implementations use ?p, 
cap or ex when font-size is specified in one of your new ways.) What, exactly, is the OpenType "ascender" and "descender"? 
Does the ascender refer to the tops of the letters bdfhkl? 
Or does ascender refer to the accents above the capital letters? 
Ideographic text (e.g. Japanese) has lots of strokes (complexity). 
You need more pixels to display Japanese than English. 
So, linking East Asian text size to H-height doesn't seem like a good idea. 
How about linking it to ?p height? 
(This is just a question. 
It does not imply that I favor your proposal.) 
I disagree. 
The TrueType em height should be set by default, as it is now. 
Erik Erik van der Poel wrote at 02/02/00 00:41 All I said was that some people seem to believe that the x-height is important, and that's why font-size-adjust exists. 
X-height is important, but it's so dependent on the typeface chosen as to become almost meaningless as some kind of "flex" value when that typeface is unavailable. 
What would you do, adjust a large x-height sans to a smaller "point" size to fake the "perceived" size of the script it was replacing? 
Isn't it conceivable that such an adjustment might actually render text that was meant as a headline/heading at a smaller size than continuous text on the same page? 
You still need to set an appropriate line spacing to avoid collisions. 
Do you want to give an example of where you think knowing the x-height might be something useful? 
-- Clive Yes. 
But in that case, the heading would have been of a similar size to the body text before the conversion. 
Which is of course fine: blockquote cite="Bringhurst, Robert 'The Elements of Typographical Style', Second Edition" Don't permit titles to oppress the text. 
In books, spaced capitals of the text size and weight are often perfectly adequate for titles ...their problem is often that the title throws it weight around, unbalancing and discoloring the page ... One way to make heads prominent without making them large is to set them entirely in the margin. 
I have used titles which were deliberately set smaller than the text, and it seemed - judging by the comments of others - to have worked; a combination of weight, small-caps, section numbering and color (of the graphic design rather than typographic variety) serving to clearly indicate function.
