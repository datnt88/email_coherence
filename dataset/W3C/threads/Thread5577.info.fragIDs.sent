<s> I have been talking for a while about accessible Web 3D applications.  </s>
<s> One idea was to create a panel on this topic to a Web 3D conference in April as an outreach event and then use that and possible other contacts that we to create a corresponding WAI RDIG teleconference event.  </s>
<s> We also talked earlier about doing something similar for the CHI conference.  </s>
<s> Maybe this kind of format could work as an outreach format to get researchers interested and thinking about these issues in their work and then use the work already done and contacts from the conference to create an RDIG event?  </s>
<s> Naturally, not all RDIG events need to be related to conference outreach.  </s>
<s> Feedback?  </s>

<s> It's been suggested that I submit a proposal for a roundtable to GDC on Accessibility and games.  </s>
<s> It would be really helpful if we could accumulate some expertise on what makes a game accessible.  </s>
<s> I've a contact at the RNIB who has supplied some materials.  </s>
<s> This is a really fundamental problem, it is far from trivial, and merits attention.  </s>
<s> Games are about having fun, and it's more fun if everyone can join in Does anyone have any suggestions?  </s>

<s> I think this would be a good topic.  </s>
<s> It touches on a lot of issues that regular WAI guidelines groups struggle with.  </s>
<s> Along with the fun aspect is the idea of competition that is inherent to many games - and also to a lot of assessment in education, and other scenarios from everyday life.  </s>
<s> Having an idea about what work is being done strikes me as something that would be very valuable.  </s>

<s> I agree with Charles this is a good idea.  </s>
<s> The next step is to start gathering links about research and researchers related to this area (I wish we could already use Annotea shared bookmarks :-) ).  </s>
<s> Another step that can happen also parallel is to try to write the first draft for such an event.  </s>
<s> After this we might have not just one but several ideas for good events related to accessible games or some related topics.  </s>
<s> Would you be interested in taking it forward Jonathan?  </s>

<s> Marja, Whilst I am very happy to contribute and comment, documentation origination is not my strong hand, so please would others contribute?  </s>
<s> I'll try to string some ideas together in the meantime ~:" A colleague at the RNIB sent me this list of VI accessible games, which my assistant is currently reviewing:  </s>
