<s> I just noticed (in draft 14) that the Variant option does not specify any addition to the OPTIONS response, to indicate that a server supports the option.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't it?  </s>

<s> Yes, I guess it should -- at least to indicate the valid VERSION-CONTROL body elements.  </s>
<s> p.s. You're not the first person to refer to a draft -14, so how is it that I only see a -13 on the delta-v webpage?  </s>
<s> Did I miss something?  </s>
<s> Tim  </s>
<s> Yes, that was just an oversight.  </s>
<s> I'll add an OPTIONS section to the Variant option.  </s>
<s> As for draft-14, it's available in text form at the ietf internet drafts site, but you are correct that I have neglected to upload it to the deltav web site ... (sorry about that!).  </s>
<s> I will do so as soon as IT restores our internet connection (which has been down all day ...!).  </s>
