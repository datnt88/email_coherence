<s> pages that follow the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines," except in very rare cases.  </s>
<s> In fact, text-only pages are frequently counterproductive  </s>

<s> Many sites that have made a commitment to accessibility in the past have  </s>

<s> As an example from my experience, I'd reviewed several US federal agency sites whose text-only sites were unusable -- a brief series of outdated one-word links, which were supposed to be equivalent to detailed blurbs on bit-mapped links on the "real" home page, and which led right back to... very inaccessible lower-level pages in the site.  </s>
<s> I just checked back on those sites, they're cleaned up now, and so wouldn't be good "bad" examples.  </s>
<s> I get a lot of press queries about how "the additional burden of maintaining text-only sites is a reason why accessibility is too much of burden"... as well as confusion that text-only sites, or generally dull and boring sites, are what we are advocating for; so this seems important to clear up.  </s>

<s> I agree that a text-only site would be a disservice to the majority of users, and less accessible to many, if it replaced the fully-formatted site,  </s>
<s> or did not contain all the information, or was not kept up-to-date.  </s>
<s> However,  </s>
<s> it seems to me that a parallel text-only site adds considerable value when those pitfalls are avoided.  </s>
<s> The Accessibility and Disabilities Group at Microsoft has an automated system that produces each page in two formats, one fully formatted and one that is text-only.  </s>
<s> This ensures that both have the same content and neither  </s>
<s> gets out of date.  </s>
<s> The text-only page provides an accessible experience with older browsers that don't allow the user to override author colors, fonts, and font sizes, or don't show the entire ALT text when images are turned off.  </s>
<s> It also provides an accessible experience for users running combinations of browser and screen reader that fail to communicate the organization of tables and frames; that can be caused either by a limitation in either the browser or the screen reader, and this still applies to most blind users at this time.  </s>
<s> Finally, for blind users running browsers that don't understand the convention for identifying navigation bars, it moves the navigation links that are standard on every page to the end instead of the beginning.  </s>
<s> Right now I only see two ways to provide equal accessibility for users running older software, one is to provide a version that leaves out certain things as described above, and the other is to dynamically customize the pages for every user on the fly.  </s>
<s> In both cases you're creating a text-only version, it's just whether you do it when the page changes or every time the user views a page.  </s>
<s> The former greatly reduces the burden on heavily used servers.  </s>
<s> Additional details about the production of our site and why we do what we do is on http://microsoft.com/enable/about.htm.  </s>
<s> Also note that we now provide a hotkey that will switch you back and forth between the fully-formatted and text-only versions of the current page, allowing more users to rely on the formatted version and switch to text-only temporarily when they hit something that is difficult for them to read.  </s>

<s> I don't think maintenance is much of an issue in situations where production is sufficiently automated.  </s>
<s> The issue is about creating seperate classes of site - although text-and-audio only serves blind users, and text only serves deaf blind users, they do not address the needs of other groups such as people with cognitive impairments.  </s>
<s> It is indeed true that the situation is one of creating a site which has multiple formats, as Greg pointed out.  </s>
<s> The problem is that removal of some accessibility barriers in one format, and some in another, can often allow some barriers to remain unnoticed in both formats.  </s>
<s> In addition there is the very real possibility of creating a separate but inferior site for some groups of people, to a much greater extent than their needs (or state of the technology) dictate.  </s>

<s> [* My prediction...*] As XML applications which have been designed from the ground up to be accessible become more common, along with browsers which can render them appropriately for users, the idea of a "text-only" version of a site will seem more and more like an evolutionary dead end which denies the richest possible experience available to users, and we will see much more accessible sites which are written to take advantage of the various methods for user selection of suitable content types.  </s>

<s> The case in point is an interesting one.  </s>
<s> There is no real problem caused by the use of spacer gifs, so long as they are transparent (they look pretty odd if they are white, and the user has a black background for high contrast, but that's the designer's misfortune) and have appropriate equivalent content - in this case alt="".  </s>
<s> That satisfies the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The use of tables is a bit trickier.  </s>
<s> There are particular problems caused by tables because screen-reading technology is only beginning to cope, and not all users have up-to-date browser/screenreader combinations.  </s>
<s> (Not surprising, given the cost involved.)  </s>
<s> The most widely available solution is Lynx, which runs on almost every platform, and can be converted to speech or braille reliably.  </s>
<s> It simply unwraps the table, so unless there has been some extraordinary work done to make the table not linearise properly (I have seen examples of this, but it is generally easy to avoid) the user can get at the content but loses much of the structural relationship implied - in particular lynx does not provide any way to view the document by columns - the best assistive technology solutuon I know for non-visual users is W3 - the browser package for emacs, and it has problems with nested tables.  </s>
<s> The use of  </s>

<s> I am probably  </s>

<s> It is possible to write XML and XSL in such a way that information is only available in a device-specific way (for example specifying colours to convey different meanings, without providing any way of knowing what the colours mean).  </s>

<s> I am sure this has a lot to do with the fact that although it seems old hat to me, HTML4 and CSS etc... are young reccomendations.  </s>

<s> Ugh!  </s>
<s> It's always something to consider, especially when we are making certain people feel like they're not the primary users of the site.  </s>
<s> That is TERRIBLE business sense.  </s>
<s> Read my "selfish reasons for accessible web design" at http://www.kynn.com/+selfish for a quote about how much money users with disabilities have to spend, and note that they'll spend it places where they feel welcome.  </s>
<s> To me, multiple views of a site are sorta like having two doors to a store.  </s>
<s> One is at the front, under the sign, with all the signs and people to greet you.  </s>
<s> The other one says "DISABLED ENTRANCE" and is around the side, with a ramp that leads up to a plainly marked door at the back of the store.  </s>
<s> If I were designing that building, I'd just make one big attractive door in the front, with a ramp up to it, that anyone could use.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't you?  </s>
<s> Then the accomodations are being made for the sucky browsers (MSIE, Netscape) -- so why are we making it look like there's something wrong with disabled folks?  </s>
<s> If I were blind, I would say, "The disability isn't that _I_ can't see the web -- the disability we're dealing with here is _your_ inability to create a good page.  </s>
<s> My disability doesn't prevent me from getting information -- yours does."  </s>
<s> I think the same thing applies here -- why not have two views of the site, one that reads "for REAL web browsers that can handle HTML correctly and accessibly" and the other labeled "for MSIE, Netscape, and other crappy browsers"?  </s>

<s> Kynn, you are eloquent as always.  </s>
<s> The allusions to the fight for civil rights are never long in coming!  </s>
<s> They continue to be appropriate.  </s>
<s> It gets trickier.  </s>
<s> There is a large contingency of folks who believe that a "text-only" version is desirable.  </s>
<s> This belief comes both from users (some of whom who are blind) and developers (some, like Microsoft, are quite sophisticated) who sincerely believe that they are doing the "right" thing.  </s>
<s> There is also the (large) middle ground of sites that offer poor quality "text-only" versions because they think that they "have to" and they (mistakenly) believe that these (scraps of text) will save them the work of (re)designing their site correctly in the first place (it won't).  </s>
<s> It is this large middle ground that we most need to get the message to.  </s>
<s> How do we do that?  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that during the desegregation of the schools that there were pockets of resistance by blacks that wanted to keep their all-black schools (which, in many cases, were quite dear to them, and not  </s>
<s> all were of inferior quality).  </s>
<s> How were these folks convinced that universal desegregation WAS as good thing?  </s>
<s> How do we convince a blind user -- who LIKES coming across "text-only" pages that s/he is accepting a "disability ghetto"?  </s>
<s> Getting back to my initial post -- Can anyone provide URLs to hard data (or research or surveys) that supports the position that text-only parallel sites are counter productive?  </s>
<s> Short of this, can anyone provide URLs for sites that advocate for the creation of text-only parallel sites?  </s>
<s> (At least then we could point the authors of such documents to this discussion thread.) Thank you all.  </s>
<s> Bruce Bailey  </s>
<s> In this case we need to show them that graphically robust, highly interactive, bleeding edge sites can be made accessible to them just as easily -- or easier!  </s>
<s> -- as text-only sites.  </s>
<s> This relies on "converting" the high end design folks to the cause -- infecting them with the accessible web authoring meme.  </s>
<s> That can be tricky because most of them have heard the myths alluded to in http://www.kynn.com/+myths -- so we need to educate them, and then we can show the doubters in the disabled community that we _can_ make sites usable by everyone, and they don't have to be the second-class citizens of the web, entering through the plain, unmarked door at the side of the store.  </s>

<s> Hmm, I'll have to be more careful answering this than the last question in this message, but the issue is well understood by all here, and is unfortunate (Bruce Bailey's followup which just appeard as I'm writing this eloquently addresses the issue in terms of segregation).  </s>
<s> It might work well to address this in terms of minorities- perhaps a poor word choice, but effective for this illustration.  </s>

<s> Different kind of person, different kind of site.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying that this is correct- but it seems the root of the text-only idea.  </s>
<s> When we discuss accessibility with a client, text-only versions are mentioned not only for use by the blind but also for slow connections, telephone/pda browsing etc...

<s> Folks, Like Jeff, this is my first post to the list.  </s>
<s> I've been reading it about a week.  </s>
<s> I moved to this list to get a broader perspective on the accessibility issues than I was able to get from a list that I thought was discussing the full spectrum of accessibility, but turned out to be dedicated only to the needs and wants of the blind.  </s>
<s> My interest in accessibility is because I'm doing a web site for a group that is focused on accessibility for the disabled.  </s>

<s> I have tagged these images ALT="blank", but have noticed that a better way would be ALT="" ...

<s> In light of the above comments, I am confused that this would be considered "very bad for accessibility".  </s>
<s> The blanks seem to me to be helpful for "accessibility" to the disability community and wider community who are sighted and need proper spacing in order to best comprehend the information presented.  </s>
<s> I am also concerned with providing pages that work as well when printed as when viewed on a screen.  </s>
<s> As an educator, I use print outs from the web as a learning resource.  </s>
<s> In the local schools, the Internet is available at a limited number of computers in the high school, and has yet to become available in the lower schools.  </s>

<s> The graphics were too few, and the text, although abundent, was all written above his head even when I read them to him.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if its an "accessibility" issue to address the needs of youthful students, or just a matter of development of the web in the K-12 arena.  </s>
