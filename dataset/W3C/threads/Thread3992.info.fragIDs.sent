<s> Personally, I've been hesitating for close to year about whether moving from DTDs to Schemas really buys me anything.  </s>
<s> It's obviously more consistent, has some really nice mechanism for 'specialization' and a few (read that as less than 6) data types that could be useful in a minor way.  </s>
<s> But the cost is pretty steep.  </s>
<s> The language is longer and more complex.  </s>
<s> Plus, I have to use namespaces even if I don't need them.  </s>
<s> And Schemas completely ignored the issue of entity declarations for characters or strings within the local document which is a *big* deal for people on the document side.  </s>
<s> This does not add up to "the cornerstone of XML technology" in my book.  </s>
<s> So, if I don't move to schemas which is likely, what has the wait for XSLT 2.0 bought me?  </s>
<s> Over a year's worth of wait for functionality that was proposed for version 1.1, based on real implementation issues from the user community, to make 2.0 compatible with Schemas which I don't need.  </s>
<s> And a very clear addition of complexity (compare the number of pages in the specs) that again doesn't buy me much.  </s>
<s> This expresses quite succinctly my feelings.  </s>
<s> I was initially interested as a development of DTD's but I really can't find either a) A use b) the tools c) the incentive to move from DTD's to schema.  </s>
<s> The second para, asking what has been gained by the wait, is also a good summary.  </s>
<s> The support for schema in the XSLT list appears minimal on the mulberrytech list, its benefits are minimal in the world of XSLT for a large majority,  </s>
<s> I'm questioning the benefit of the increased complexity on both implementor and end user.  </s>
<s> The sense of the comments on the XSLT list appear to support a)The lack of delivery of the feature set 'demanded' by end users.  </s>
<s> b)The purpose of schema support when so little is gained.  </s>
<s> Is it a case of the WG running wild with what could be done?  </s>
<s> The goal was to quote Simplify manipulation of XML Schema-typed content and quote Improve ease of use /quote The way the document is approaching epic proportions, it would appear these goals will not be met.  </s>

<s> I agree with you that not everyone needs schemas.  </s>
<s> For most of my own ad-hoc uses of XML (including preparation of W3C specs) I don't use them myself - though the DTD's we use are becoming so elaborate that perhaps we should.  </s>
<s> But as XML becomes used more and more for information storage and as the  </s>
<s> middleware for building distributed applications, I think it's clear to a lot of people that you need to get your information models under control, and that's what schemas are for.  </s>
<s> As I explained in response to another comment, I think we're doing two things with XSLT 2.0: we're adding a lot of useful functionality in direct response to user experience with 1.0, and we're extending the range of application of the language (its scaleability, if you like) by putting in a stronger underpinning in the type system.  </s>
<s> We are conscious that for many of the existing applications of the language, this doesn't necessarily add immediate value.  </s>
<s> We are also aware that the process of bringing together two working groups has caused far more delay than we would have liked.  </s>
<s> We're not complacent, but we're all confident that the alternative, of allowing XSLT and XQuery and XML Schema to go their separate ways, would have been doing a far greater disservice to the user community.  </s>

<s> I hope this group of end users of XSLT are not forgotten in the dash to look to the future.  </s>
<s> Why this can't be done incrementally, adding features which are needed now, and adding later when the demand is there in numbers I simply don't know.  </s>
<s> Please be aware the WG output will be judged against its requirement.  </s>
