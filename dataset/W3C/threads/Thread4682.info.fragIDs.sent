<s> It seems at odds that an inline comment does not require content: XmlComment ::= " !--" Char* "-- "  </s>
<s> and yet a constructed one does: ComputedXmlComment ::= "comment" "{" Expr "}" It would make more sense as: ComputedXmlComment ::= "comment" "{" Expr?  </s>
<s> "}"  </s>
<s> Surely the only reason for using a computed comment constructor is that you want to compute the content?  </s>
<s> And anyway, you can always write: comment {""} Michael Kay  </s>
<s> By that argument it doesn't make sense to have content optional for any of the computed constructors.  </s>
<s> For example, why not write: element a {""} instead of allowing element a {}?  </s>
<s> Another reason for using computed comment constructors (or any constructor for that matter) is to avoid escaping the  or using a CDATA section when the XQuery happens to itself be embedded in an XML document.  </s>
<s> For example, if I create (or want to match) an empty comment, I (used to) have to write !---- which is entirely unreadable.  </s>
<s> I realize that it's not a big issue to write comment {""}, but it simply adds inconsistency to the language/parser which seems unnecessary.  </s>
