The following is the proposal based on everyone's ideas so far and the discussion in the GL call today. 
1) There is a WCAG Base document which provides the level 1 and Level 2 items (For the time being the three levels are being called Level 1 - Guidelines Level 2 - Checkpoints Level 3 - Checkpoint Solutions 
2) There are a series of documents which we call Technology Specific Checkpoint Solutions These documents use the Level 1 Guidelines as divisions The level 2 items are checkpoints in the document 
3) Under each Checkpoint are a series of conditionals that read like - If you use the IMG tag than you must do one of the following 
Under that conditional - you list all of the things that are acceptable checkpoint solutions (which could be a set of things) for that checkpoint and that condition. 
- The second last item in the list is always: "Alternate Equivalent Solution" ...... though if you use an equivalent method you must document it on your website.) 
- The last item is a statement that this element is not used. 
Such 
as "IMG tag is not used" For EACH conditional they MUST then do one of the items or item sets in the list (which includes "EQUIVALENT" and "NOT USED") 
4) If they are able to check one "checkpoint solution" for each conditional under a checkpoint then they can check off the Checkpoint. 
5) To be Compliant at any level, you must have checked off all the checkpoints for that level. 
(this only works NOTES: - if there is anything that MUST be part of ANY solution for a checkpoint - then that should appear in each alternative and it should also appear in the Equivalent statement.

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@trace.wisc.edu 
Seems to imply a division along "element" lines rather than "checkpoint" lines? 
So are the "solutions" thusly divided (perhaps each "element" of a "technology" must be under some checkpoint)? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE

I'm not sure what the term "element" means here. 
The example -- of the IMG HTML element -- may imply that we are talking about markup elements, or that we are talking about particular "components" of a technology. 
It might make more sense to say that the last item is a statement that the checkpoint does not apply _BECAUSE_ "no images are used on the page" or whatever.

I like this as much as I like any terminology choices. 
I acknowledge that we will always find someone who doesn't like any given term, and this seems a decent compromise with an appropriate focus. 
Very good. 
We also need a series of documents which we call "Technology 
NON-Specific Checkpoint Solutions" or the like, right? 
For things which do not, strictly speaking, fall under any given technology? 
Or are we assuming we will include those on the TSCS? 
Such a document might be worth making anyway, even if it's not released, for internal use -- in other words, something that says to us making TSCS docs, "Here's what you need to include that are solutions, but which can be used with a number of technologies." 
Or we might be assuming that those will fit into the level 2 Checkpoint hierarchy? 
Is there more than one conditional per checkpoint? 
I like this. 
I think I proposed it last year. 
;) 
Very nice.

Hynn's point is really important - at the end of the day there are a number of questions like "did you put a picture in your page? 
If so did you do it using the img element, the object element, as a background property, by using pre to construct a diagram using characters, ... If we use the term element it will be understood by people who know the languages (HTML or whatever) to mean a particular language element. 
Most of our requirements are about page components and the way they function.

GREGG: YES - THAT IS ALREADY AT LEVEL 2 
Is there more than one conditional per checkpoint? 
Gregg: THERE CAN BE -- YES 
Such 
I like this. 
I think I proposed it last year. 
;) (KYNN) GREGG: THEN IT MUST BE A GOOD IDEA
