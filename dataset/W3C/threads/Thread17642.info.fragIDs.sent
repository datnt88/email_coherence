<s> Hello, At the beginning of the Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, there is a section that discusses the different between structural and presentation elements/attributes in HTML.  </s>

<s> These things can be done, but I am not sure that tagging them is the best way to go about it - it is a repair strategy for poor design.  </s>
<s> What should be done is: Collections of anchors: use MAP TABLE: there should not be layout tables events: Events can change the DOM - either at the level of a content node or (in DOM2) changing style properties (which is the well-designed way to do rollover highlights etc so they can be reproduceed across different devices).  </s>
<s> These changes can be tested, and can probably be tested in advance as a repair strategy.  </s>
<s> Verification events are pretty meaningless unless they have some effect.  </s>
<s> If that effect is to make a specialised call to the server (eg saying what is wrong) then there is not much that can be done to track them.  </s>
<s> If they actually change the DOM (eg making a note for an input that was not well-formed) then they would look like transformation events, and teh heuristic for finding them would be based on the fact that they are attached to particular types of elements (INPUT, SUBMIT, etc) Charles McCN Is there a way we could add a general section on tagging the purpose of certain elements.  </s>
