Restricting IETF protocols to use of Unicode/3.2 is not a desirable outcome of the IETF's wide support for the Stringprep approach. 
Agreed, RFC 3454 needs an update for Unicode 4.0.

Perhaps an update is in order, but this does not change the fact that a stable reference to a specific version of Unicode that won't be changed or amended in any way is required by stringprep. 
Don't expect this requirement to change or go away.

Hi Ned, I understand the need for a stable reference ("these base tables have rules that cover the repertoire of Unicode/3.2"). 
But the proliferation of IETF application and infrastructure protocols (like 'iSCSI') using profiles of what I'll call Stringprep/3.2 (RFC 3454), means that when they exchange and compare URI, internationalized domain names, etc., they can only use the repertoire in Unicode/3.2. 
That seems self-defeating. 
Protocols should be able to use any newly assigned Unicode/x.y characters without breaking in a Stringprep environment.

Please note that IDNA effectively can use new characters, because stringprep/nameprep on the client side does not apply to unassigned characters. 
The need for an update is only on the registration side. 
I think I would advocate that we update stringprep/nameprep/idna immediately to Unicode 4.0 if it were not for the fact that this technology is just now being introduced. 
The success of 
IDNA does not depend on the few additional characters in Unicode 4.0. 
But it may be worth to wait with the update until we get a bit more actual practical experience.

You need not bundle stringprep/nameprep/idna all in one big lump. 
I think stringprep could very well (and should, IMHO) be updated right now, so that new profiles can use all of 4.0. 
But I agree that IDNA should not bite the bullet too hastily.

Hi, A quick review of the Internet-Drafts index indicates that at least the following groups are doing (one or more) Stringprep profiles: - IPS iSCSI - LDAPbis - SASL - XMPP - IDNA The SLP Project (no longer IETF chartered) is also looking at Stringprep for service URL and service attribute comparisons.

Is this the right list to discuss StringPrep?
