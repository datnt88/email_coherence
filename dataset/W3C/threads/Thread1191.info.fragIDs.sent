<s> Agreed, RFC 3454 needs an update for Unicode 4.0.  </s>

<s> Hi Ned, I understand the need for a stable reference ("these base tables have rules that cover the repertoire of Unicode/3.2").  </s>
<s> But the proliferation of IETF application and infrastructure protocols (like 'iSCSI') using profiles of what I'll call Stringprep/3.2 (RFC 3454), means that when they exchange and compare URI, internationalized domain names, etc., they can only use the repertoire in Unicode/3.2.  </s>
<s> That seems self-defeating.  </s>
<s> Protocols should be able to use any newly assigned Unicode/x.y characters without breaking in a Stringprep environment.  </s>

<s> Please note that IDNA effectively can use new characters, because stringprep/nameprep on the client side does not apply to unassigned characters.  </s>
<s> The need for an update is only on the registration side.  </s>
<s> I think I would advocate that we update stringprep/nameprep/idna immediately to Unicode 4.0 if it were not for the fact that this technology is just now being introduced.  </s>
<s> The success of  </s>
<s> IDNA does not depend on the few additional characters in Unicode 4.0.  </s>
<s> But it may be worth to wait with the update until we get a bit more actual practical experience.  </s>

<s> You need not bundle stringprep/nameprep/idna all in one big lump.  </s>
<s> I think stringprep could very well (and should, IMHO) be updated right now, so that new profiles can use all of 4.0.  </s>
<s> But I agree that IDNA should not bite the bullet too hastily.  </s>

<s> Hi, A quick review of the Internet-Drafts index indicates that at least the following groups are doing (one or more) Stringprep profiles: - IPS iSCSI - LDAPbis - SASL - XMPP - IDNA The SLP Project (no longer IETF chartered) is also looking at Stringprep for service URL and service attribute comparisons.  </s>
