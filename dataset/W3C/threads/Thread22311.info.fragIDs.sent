<s> Is there a way of detecting the positional location of a specific element?  </s>
<s> Such a feature would be of interest for certain applications, where one likes to position certain elements in relation to the position of other elements.  </s>

<s> NOTE: These methods are only valid if the document is locked from modification while you are doing the traversal.  </s>
<s> To determine the depth of a node in the tree you can traverse the nodes returned by getParentNode() until the method returns null and count how many ancestors the node has.  </s>
<s> To determine the ordinal position of a node within its siblings you can do the same thing but call getPreviousSibling() instead of getParentNode().  </s>

<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> To position a node in relation to the position of other elements, one can use the insertBefore() , getPreviousSibling() and getNextSibling() methods defined by the Node interface.  </s>
<s> As far as I know the DOM interfaces provide no method for retrieving the numerical value of the position of a node in a stucture implementing a NodeList.  </s>
