<s> Hello, I know it's not Monday, but I've been reading as much as I can in between work and life, and my mind keeps going back to this bit in the SMIL 2.0 specification: "Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages, in particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization."  </s>
<s> I've been wondering if it would be possible to come up with a better or simpler (but not /too/ simple) timing model than the folks who worked on SMIL 1.0 and 2.0, and who've probably put decades of collective man-years into thinking about this particular problem.  </s>
<s> I've nearly decided that it would be difficult (and possibly not the best use of our time) to effectively reinvent the timing wheel.  </s>
<s> What would using SMIL's well-defined timing model for TT look like?  </s>
<s> Maybe something like: "One" displays immediately, at the start of the sequence, and ends 5 seconds later.  </s>
<s> (Specifying a begin time of 0 seconds is optional, since the default begin offset is always 0 seconds.) "Two" displays 0 seconds (the default) after "First" -- i.e. 5 seconds into the sequence.  </s>
<s> It ends 10 seconds later, at 15 seconds into the sequence.  </s>
<s> "Third" has a begin offset of 1 second, so it begins 1 second after "Two", and has a duration of 5 seconds, so it ends at 21 seconds into the sequence.  </s>
<s> Visually, it is displayed in the "important" style.  </s>
<s> (If people have scenarios that they'd like me to whip up solutions for using this timing model, please let me know!)  </s>

<s> This must be catered for.  </s>
<s> I.e. the TT must be able to refer to absolute external timestamps (not 1 sec per sec 'real times').  </s>
<s> Simlarly off times need to be expressed wrt the program material, so even if specified as durations they would be re-calculated by adding the duration to the TCIn value.  </s>

<s> John,  </s>
<s> Great, this is an even simpler example.  </s>
<s> A couple of the more serious issues: -- You're using SMPTE time code, which uses an hours:minutes:seconds:frames format.  </s>
<s> Since "frame" isn't an agreed-upon unit of measurement (are we talking NTSC?  </s>
<s> PAL/SECAM?  </s>
<s> Film?  </s>
<s> Drop frame or non-drop frame?), that doesn't work.  </s>
<s> -- You've invented a new file format, which means that you have to invent everything around that.  </s>
<s> You have to evangelize tool vendors to adopt Yet Another File Format which, unlike XML, there's no OS-level support for.  </s>
<s> You have to invent methods for verifying legal files.  </s>
<s> It doesn't play well with other standards.  </s>
<s> Etc.  </s>
<s> Here's your example recast as Proposal 0.0.  </s>
<s> Since you used French, I'm assuming SECAM and that your frame units were intended to be 1/25th of a second.  </s>
<s> I've made everything relative except for the start so that it  </s>

<s> OK, I can see that you're not getting what I'm trying to explain :-( For the purposes of the following we'll assume that a 'tape' is used for video storage.  </s>
<s> Forgive me if this appears to be a dumbed down explanation.  </s>
<s> Currently subtitling works as follows.  </s>
<s> Broadcaster decides to show a program X - he prepares a master 'tape' TapeX.  </s>
<s> TapeX is sent to an external subtitling agency who prepare a subtitle 'file' FileX.  </s>
<s> FileX is indexed against the timecode that is stored as VBI data on TapeX.  </s>
<s> So unlike SMIL - the media are separate - subtitles in one - video and audio on another.  </s>
<s> Broadcaster plays TapeX on a tape machine on a number of different occasions (i.e at different wall clock times).  </s>
<s> On each occassion the tape is played - the timecode off the tape will be identical in sequence.  </s>
<s> The subtitle inserter (having had the correct FileX selected by an automation system) continuously reads the timecode from the input video signal generated by the tape machine playing tapeX.  </s>
<s> When an input timecode matches a timecode in fileX it starts inserting the matching subtitle, by modifying the video signal.  </s>
<s> When the timecode on the input matches the end time for that subtitle - it stops showing the subtitle.  </s>
<s> The inserter is not playing the video media - it is watching it and responding to it.  </s>
<s> In SMIL, the UA is orchestrating all the components of the presentation.  </s>
<s> Ok - so far you could get away with duration based subtitling - but it is much more convenient to have the absolute off air time in the subtitle file, since that is what you are matching against.  </s>
<s> In practice, the broadcaster will want to show adverts.  </s>
<s> These can occur at **any time** during the broadcast, and may differ from showing to showing, but when they occur they can be detected by the subtitle inserter by a change in the timecode it is reading (by convention adverts are timed with a different start time to programs....[typically programs are 10 hours+, ads are 1 hours+].  </s>
<s> The program may or may not be created with specific ad insert points in mind, regardless - the broadcaster often goes to air with an advert while a subtitle is still on screen (i.e. it is part way through its duration).  </s>
<s> This can occur because advert insert points are often timed to occur literally just after a significant burst of dialogue (subtitles generally have a longer duration for presentation than the corresponding audio).  </s>
<s> So you need to be able to off air the subtitle **early**.  </s>
<s> In your above example you say : "Let's say you want to show the word "foo" for 5 seconds, 10 seconds from the start of a commercial."  </s>
<s> But the point is that, when the program restarts after an advert, I want to show the subtitles at the correct point with respect to the timecode on the program material.  </s>
<s> Subtitles are frame accurate for lip synching.  </s>
<s> I can't use 10 seconds after the commercial - how does that relate to where I am in the program?  </s>
<s> What if TapeX has been advanced half a second or two while the commercial break occurred?  </s>
<s> This is what timecode on video is for - synchronisation.  </s>
<s> By using absolute tape times in the subtitle file - the subtitle inserter has a simple task.  </s>
<s> Match timecodes and insert.  </s>
<s> It doesn't need to be informed when a commercial occurs - it is resilient to changes in the timecode in the input signal.  </s>
<s> I fear this still doesn't explain adequately why a duration based, relative timing model is inappropriate for broadcast subtitling... but perhaps we are getting hung up on broadcast.  </s>
<s> I can conceive of other situations where the assumption of 1 sec per sec is invalid.  </s>
<s> Timed text implies duration - but in practice I believe timed text is better supported by an event driven model.  </s>
<s> SMIL already adequately covers duration based text presentation.  </s>
<s> SMIL has wallclock timebase - but that's no use.  </s>
<s> Sarcasm aside, timebases can always be converted into a single format.  </s>
<s> The issue is the resolution of the timebase.  </s>
<s> Anyway, in practice the standards you mention above are actually event driven.  </s>
<s> A film may be designed to be played at 1/25th of a second - but when played at 1/30th it is faster, but still self consistent, so is a stopped frame.  </s>
<s> What would happen with a subtitle under proposal 0.0 if the tape was stopped?  </s>
<s> In 'real life' the subtitle should remain until the tape restarts and moves past the off air time.  </s>
<s> In broadcast the frame is king - not the time ;-) regards John Birch The views and opinions expressed are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Screen Subtitling Systems Limited.  </s>
<s> The point I am trying to make wrt to SMIL timing models is: How do you synchronise the 'presentation' of the text with an external often  </s>
<s> Not true : SMIL is only a container with *references* to the media.  </s>
<s> SMIL contains no actual content data (images, video, audio *or* streaming text).  </s>
<s> Though it can have text segments if its constructed badly (or very brief !) Additionally, about the size of SMIL files, they are often under 1k.  </s>
<s> Streamed text (eg realtext) is usually minimal in size compared to even static images used as slides in a presentation (let alone audio or video content).  </s>
<s> Even better, this text can be compressed - most internet user agents (quicktime 4+, media player6.4+, real player 5+) will send an accept gzip header.  </s>
<s> Looking for this on the server and sending gzip deflate-encoded data will reduce the file size to well under 50% (more with an XML based format because of compression of repeated tag names).  </s>
<s> I frequently see XML zip compression to 15-25% of the original file size.  </s>
<s> So I don't think we need to be too concerned about the verbosity of XML as a wire format.  </s>
<s> Even without server side compression, most modems do a good enough job of compressing text for non-web applications.  </s>

<s> I am very happy with that.  </s>
<s> In my view, TT is something like : - a concatenation of text strings; - each text string has a start and end time; - each text string may have some dynamic behavior in time, such as scrolling, colour changes (Karaoke), etc.  </s>
<s> So what I think is needed, is to express the above in XML, while using a notion of time that needs further discussion.  </s>
