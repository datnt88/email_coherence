There is an example of a script at http://www.peepo.com that allows keyboard navigation to work like mouse-based navigation, changing an effect that is stylistic. 
(This is a cool example of how this should be done, but also shows the hassles of dealing with current browsers...) It occurs to me that the script could be generalised, so that instead of triggering a specific action, it triggers a mouseover / click / etc event. 
This could then be used in a browser as an implementation example for ensuring device-independent access to event triggers in HTML, which is important for accessibility, but as I understand it at risk for lack of implementation proof. 
Any takers for playing with this?

if you tab around the screen the letters also appear. 
however when you tab to the two visible images/link in the center of the screen the sound, that is played with a mouse over, does not play.
