<s> In the absence of minutes for our conference call I have written up my notes, attached below.  </s>
<s> Please revise or add if I missed something which you feel is pertinent.  </s>
<s> As discussed I would like to distribute the Page Author recommendations among the AU group members.  </s>
<s> For each recommendation we need to come up with guidelines for how this can be supported in the authoring tool.  </s>
<s> The structure that would be used would be the structure proposed in the agenda notes and discussed during our conference call.  </s>
<s> Thus for each recommendation we want to look at: - help file and documentation text - appropriate prompts in dialogs - when, what is the text - warnings when the prompts are not followed- when, what is the text - checker- can this be reliably checked, what are the conditions that would cause this to be flagged - tool and wizards - are there any tools or wizards that would make it easier to follow this recommendation.  </s>
<s> Could everyone please volunteer for your favorite recommendation.  </s>
<s> I have listed them below.  </s>
<s> We will then compile all the draft recommendations by March 23 and schedule a conference call to go over them for that same week.  </s>
<s> Proposed times are Wednesday March 25 3pm EST or Friday March 27 11 am EST.  </s>
<s> The recommendations we need volunteers for are (please send you choice to the list): Please feel free to volunteer for more than one) Recommendations 1. Style Sheets 2. Images and Image Maps 3. Applets and Scripts  </s>
<s> 4. Audio and Video 5. Text, Symbols, Punctuation, Phrases, and Paragraphs  </s>
<s> 6. Lists and Outlining 7. Tables (Harvey for sure)  </s>
<s> 8. Links 9. Frames (Scott has volunteered) 10.  </s>
<s> User-Input Forms 11.  </s>
<s> If All Else Fails... 12. Good Web Site Design Practices  </s>
<s> Meeting Notes: 1. Brief Introductions Mickey, Harvey, Jim, Lauren, William, Gregg, Mike, Chuck, Jan, Wendy, Scott and Jutta were present.  </s>
<s> 2. Brief review of charter (http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/AU/charter.txt) 3. WWW7 meeting, There will be an AU meeting on April the 18 at the WWW7 conference in Brisbane.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, most working group member will not be in Australia.  </s>
<s> Jutta will investigate an audioconfence bridge for the WWW7 meetings. 4. Author supports (see agenda notes) The proposed author supports were reviewed.  </s>
<s> The consensus seemed to be: - pop-up warnings should be used sparingly, - a spell checker like checker would be beneficial, although difficult to implement because of the complexities of what is checked - the more tools to make processes automatic the better 5. Recommendation structure (see agenda notes) The recommendation structure was tested using the example of framesets.  </s>
<s> It became apparent that there were still issues to resolve regarding the frames recommendation which is a task for the GL group.  </s>
<s> Several tools were proposed to support the creation of a noframes alternative.  </s>
<s> The proposed structure appeared suitable for the task.  </s>
<s> 6. Ranking priority It was suggested and agreed upon that we should follow the GL ranking of "required", "recommended" as well as "interim" and "new" (see: 7. Default alt-text (see agenda notes) It was suggested that if there was default text it should be quite clear that it was only default text with a statement such as "graph: alt-text to be added" Chuck stressed that Microsoft is presently dealing with this issue and would appreciate some timely input.  </s>
<s> I'll be at XML conference in Seattle then, so not available.  </s>
<s> Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> Harvey Bingham -- as tester and serious exploiter of Bobby ?13. Accessibility for XML/XLL/XSL?  </s>
<s> Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> I'd be willing to help with either of these.  </s>
<s> However, I would rather work with someone as my experiance with HTML is limited.  </s>
<s> Either of the days would work for me for the conference call.  </s>
<s> ******* MQ *******  </s>
<s> Great, I will try to find someone to work on these with you.  </s>
<s> It appears that neither of the originally suggested days is good for the majority of the group members.  </s>
<s> I will try to find other times when the bridge is free.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
