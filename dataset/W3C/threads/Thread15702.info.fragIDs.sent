<s> As a web developer, for me the argument is not wether not to images or text, but the accessability of the location to a text-browser as well as a graphical one.  </s>
<s> Dropping graphics to the eager-to-see graphics surfer does not acheive accessability, in fact it discourages visitation.  </s>
<s> We ought not to forget that images carry messages especially to the visual-dependant!  </s>
<s> To clarify my position, I think that text links are more usable than images are links, which in turn are more usable than image maps.  </s>
<s> This applies to users of graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> There are many reasons for that, including the ability to ditinguish between visited and unvisited links and using active and hover feedbacks.  </s>
<s> In a text browser, all three options are equivalent (if there is correct alt text) as images and image maps are upgarded to text by the browser.  </s>
<s> When in 'Text' mode, visited, unvisited, active and (IE)hover works perfectly well, with the assistance of CSS.  </s>
<s> So where is the argument.  </s>
<s> Shurel.  </s>

<s> My point on tables was that some authors write image maps that arrange the links to look like a table (usually with one column; see the notorious CNN interactive site) I said that using an HTML table with text links, gets the same look as an image map (see CNN interactive text-only bad-tables version) without loosing the advantages of text links.  </s>
<s> Clearly from the point of view of accessibility putting the links in a a list is better than in a table.  </s>

<s> Image maps - just say no.  </s>
<s> To make long stroy short, the problems with image maps are mostly usability problems in graphical media.  </s>
<s> Shurel: When in 'Text' mode, visited, unvisited, active and (IE)hover works perfectly well, with the assistance of CSS.  </s>
<s> So where is the argument.  </s>
<s> Nir: 1. W3C hover, not IE hover.  </s>
<s> Also Lynx marks the hovered link with a different color (although it has a completely different pointing device).  </s>
<s> 2. You don't need CSS for hover, both Lynx and IE4 apply user's default hover colors/styles without any stylesheet of the author.  </s>
<s> 3. The argument is that most (or all?) versions of Netscape and Explorer cannot be configured to 'Text' mode.  </s>
<s> They present "alt" text is a small size font, even if it is H1.  </s>
<s> The only graphical browser that I know that can be configured to something close to text mode is Opera.  </s>
<s> Users of Netscape and Explorer in graphical mode with images either on or off suffer a lot from websites written under the assumption that their readers are stupid people who can't read, or "visual-dependant[sic.]" as someone put it.  </s>
<s> Also in graphical media with no mouse (e.g. tv ) image maps constitute a very serious usability problem.  </s>

<s> I agree on all points except one, i.e., (3).  </s>
<s> If we stick to the topic of image maps.  </s>
<s> In an image map, we don't need headers H1 , or do we? Image maps are nothing but navigation means via points.  </s>
<s> Well if the link of the image map cannot be reach, I suppose that the normal links cannot be reached either.  </s>
