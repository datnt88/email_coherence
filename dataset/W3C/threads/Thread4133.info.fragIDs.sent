<s> *Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order* The first paragraph says that a document order is total.  </s>

<s> Is it intended that the ordering in the latter two paragraphs is total?  </s>
<s> Or could a conforming implementation simply say, "I choose not to define an ordering between nodes in different documents, or between nodes not in any document.  </s>
<s> My ordering of these things is the trivial ordering, the one which such things simply have no ordering."?  </s>
<s> Put another way, is there anything that breaks if an implementation is not able to place a collection of free-standing nodes into a stable order?  </s>
<s> Yes, for example: $someNodeSet[2] where $someNodeSet contains nodes from at least two different documents.  </s>
<s> Using a  </s>
<s> positional predicate requires that there is total order on any node-set.  </s>
<s> This order must be stable, otherwise one may get different results on two different references to the above XPath expression.  </s>
<s> Because sets are unordered by definition, it is meaningless to talk about some other order (e.g. order of nodes as they come in the node-set) except document order, which is specified in XPath with exactly the purpose of being the only order specified.  </s>
<s> Therefore, document order covers by definition all types of node-sets, including the case of node-sets comprising nodes from different documents.  </s>
<s> I also find the name "document order" confusing in this last case.  </s>
<s> Probably "canonical order" or any name which doesn't refer only to a (single) document will be better.  </s>
