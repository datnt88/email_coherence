Just a thought on this ... 
Chaals raises the issue of merging different vocabularies. 
I think that that is a different issue and raises many other complications, but as he says the extra verification or disambiguation step that I have described above applies there too. 
As the present SKOS draft doesn't cover questions of mapping between vocabularies, I think we should keep it to what is necessary and desirable for a single vocabulary. 
I think 'merging' and 'mapping' are completely different scenarios. 
In mapping, the schemes are kept separate, and linked via mapping statements. 
In merging, a new scheme is created by combining concepts from different sources. 
It's worth considering the situations where separate groups of people (part of a larger community) are responsible for contributing concepts as part of a larger scheme. 
In this scenario we may expect to find overlap of labels.

Before you merge them, you may have to undertake a mapping operation in order to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies. 
A label may be associated with different concepts in the part-thesauri being mapped together. 
Once you have merged the contributions into a whole, each label in the single resulting thesaurus should be unique. 
This should therefore be a requirement of a scheme of encoding any single thesaurus, it seems to me.

Clearly Leonard and I (and to some extent Alistair and I) are currently looking from different perspectives. 
I don't see any point in a mapping unless it is to allow use of two vocabularies as if they are merged (an artifact of RDF is that as soon as we have a mapping we can treat these things as merged). 
As I understand it one of the important features of the work is the ability to do this mapping (although it isn't kept in the same namespace, it is a requirement, and it is certainly the basis of my interest in this). 
I maintain that one of the use cases that makes the SKOS work interesting is the parallel work on mapping, and that we should ensure that we don' break this. 
I therefore think that we should separate what we consider Best Practice (for example having the same label as possibly referring to two concepts is generally a bad idea) from making something absolutely incorrect when there is reason to believe that it will arise in practice due to sensible work. 
So I would continue to suppport the idea that things are "strong usage recommendations" (but not encoded in the ontology definition frameworks), rather than seeking to outlaw them by specifying appropriate RDF/OWL constraints.

This conversation is making me nervous about the misunderstandings that arise when we use our own terminology imprecisely. 
By "mapping" I mean setting up a relationship between terms or codes that represent concepts in different vocabularies. 
By "merging" I mean taking two or more vocabularies and making them into one vocabulary. 
(For this purpose I would make use of any mappings that were available). 
But the most obvious applications of mappings do not involve merging. 
For example, you can use mappings to translate metadata descriptions from one vocabulary to another. 
Or you can use them to translate Search statements from one vocabulary to another. 
You can do either of these without building a merged vocabulary. 
Any of the applications will work much better if the people who built the vocabularies and the mappings followed the guidelines (e.g. ISO 2788) rigorously while doing it. 
Between 2 different vocabularies, you can and should expect to find one label applying to 2 different concepts. 
But within one thesaurus, it is straightforward to require each term to be unique, and not an unreasonable requirement.
