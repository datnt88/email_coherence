FYI Under Win 95, Amaya 1.1a doesn't seem to handle this tag right. 
SIZE=n seems to be interpreted as font_size := n rather than font_size := n*font_size.

Yours, Lee. 
seems to SIZE=n seems to n*font_size. 
font Well, you're right, of course, as far as HTML 3.2 is concerned. 
I should have written ... font_size := n rather than font_size := n*k*default_font_size ... where k is such that k*default_font_size corresponds to SIZE=1 However, the fact remains that I see 1pt text with SIZE=1 and 2pt with SIZE=2. 
Perhaps there's a default style setting that I haven't discovered.

75 Hampstead Road c=gb;a=attmail;p=logica; London NW1 2PL o=lg;ou1=lgwct;s=fieldhouse UK I think that Amaya is right. 
Refer to the HTML 3.2 specs: You can set size to an integer ranging from 1 to 7 for an absolute font size, or specify a relative font size with a signed integer value, e.g. size="+1" or size="-2". 
This is mapped to an absolute font size by adding the current base font size as set by the BASEFONT element.

Well, I had the wrong idea about FONT SIZE. 
But apparently Amaya is more wrong, as I discuss below.

Personally I find the text there on FONT and BASEFONT somewhat unclear, despite the examples. 
Perhaps this can be improved in 4.0 if these tags survive. 
Obviously this 'absolute font size' is not meant to be a font point size, or it would have a range of 1-70 (say). 
So the issue is, how do you compute the point size n of SIZE=m text? 
Presumably, you take the point size N of Normal text and relate it to the BASEFONT value b, if specified (default b=3 is hinted in the HTML3.2 ref): n := f( N, m, b) eg, n := N*m/b or, for some k ~ 1/b, n := N*(1+k*(m-b) ) What I see in Amaya 1.1a is n := m. 
This is different from other browsers I use and makes HTML containing FONT SIZE=m with m=1,2 unreadable (and you may say, this is what they deserve for using a stupid tag that breaks the HTML concept of tagging by intent rather than presentation, and I would have agreed, except that the thing has been so widely adopted). 
Doesn't this work sensibly in the Unix versions?
