<s> I propose the following to resolve issue 190: Current checkpoint: 5.1 Provide programmatic read and write access to content by conforming to W3C Document Object Model (DOM) specifications and exporting interfaces defined by those specifications.  </s>

<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> 5.3 Provide progammatic support for the event model and methods for form controls and links using the interfaces specified in the W3C Document Object Model (DOM level 2 CR) and exporting those interfaces to other applications .  </s>

<s> aloha, jon! while i agree with rich and charles that 5.5 should be at least a priority 2 checkpoint, isn't programmatic support for the event model key to successfully tailoring an AT to work with any UA which supports the W3C DOM Level 2 by providing access to the event model?  </s>
<s> so wouldn't that make it not just at least a priority 2, but an outright priority 1? jon, did you originally accord it a p3 because of turn-around timing issues vis a vis the implementation of DOM2 by industry?  </s>
<s> if so, perhaps we do need to consider some sort of priority level that reflects that quote this will be the best (read: required) way to do this when the following comes to pass unquote... reopening the priority issue isn't a route that i particularly want to travel, but in this instance, at least, perhaps valid... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
