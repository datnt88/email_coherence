<s> More reports from the March 8 and 12 meetings.  </s>
<s> Attendence was confusing: every member of the ERB was in attendence in part, but there was a certain amount of checking in and out based on travel plans and interruptions; my notes record no dissenting votes to any of the following, but some member who missed a particular vote may choose to record a dissent: 1.  </s>
<s> The XML-LINK attribute will get a new declared value.  </s>
<s> So far, we have (LINK|XLINK), which inconveniently doesn't provide a this-ain't-no- steenking-link value to override a defaulted value from the subset.  </s>
<s> So we'll change it to (LINK|XLINK|FALSE).  </s>
<s> 2. We discussed the idea of having a way to provide a base address; the LOCATION-SOURCE and IMPLIED-LOCATION-SOURCE stuff in the initial draft.  </s>
<s> The ERB is powerfully in favor of giving entities a way to specify the canonical address by which they'd like to be referred to, bookmarked, relative address computed, etc.  </s>
<s> But we realize this is really not XML-LINK stuff, just a very convenient convenience feature  </s>
<s> for the XML language itself.  </s>
<s> So we provisionally decided (provisionally because this hasn't had WG exposure) to create a new per-entity ?XML-BASE  </s>
<s> PI and write that into the language spec.  </s>
<s> We could not, at this time, muster support for the IMPLIED-LOCATION-SOURCE stuff.  </s>
<s> 3. We took up the questions of what subset of TEI Xpointers we're going to need.  </s>
<s> We developed consensus that: - the subset in the initial spec is reasonable, except that - even though SPAN is really useful, we are nervous that as far as we know, the world has only one implementation, namely Panorama; are there others?, and - sub-element addressing (TOKEN, character counting, patterns) are just not stable enough, particularly in the case of some Asian languages, to be worthwhile including in XML-Link release 1.0.  </s>
<s> 4. We decided that we were not going to specify support for any query language, built-in or FOREIGN, in XML-Link 1.0, beyond TEI Xpointers, which are in fact a query language.  </s>
<s> Support in some way for SDQL remains firmly on the agenda, but not in this release.  </s>
<s> 5. On the subject of Extended Link Groups, the ERB is unanimous that we must have some way of providing this function - of pointing to  </s>
<s> other documents that contain links into a current one.  </s>
<s> However, there is another standardization effort underway in the W3C called Web Collections that may well be, in parallel, cooking up a solution to this same problem.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the rumor mill says that the idea of using XML for Web Collections is in play.  </s>
<s> We have an action item to check this out - if we can outsource this job to existing web machinery, it would clearly be a good thing.  </s>
<s> 6. We discussed whether or not we should specify a process model, i.e. assert that a locator containing a '#' should be split in two, the part before the '#' being handled by the server to retrieve a resource, the part after being used by the client to track down a more specific resource within the retrieved one.  </s>
<s> This is universal Web behavior.  </s>
<s> We decided not to specify this, and leave it to the implementors; clearly we can think of cases (humungous SGML docs) where we'd like the server to help out with the after-the-# part; while it's hard to see how that could happen in the current Web architecture, we are reluctant to rule it out.  </s>

<s> Is this the work sitting behind a passworded web site and available only to dues-paying members of the W3C?  </s>
<s> If so, how does that fit into a spec being developed by this Working Group which includes consortium and non-consortium members?  </s>

<s> Well, I when I go to look at "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Submission/1997/2/Overview.html", the site certainly behves like it's passworded and not available to non-consortium members.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the abstract that I can read says: "The submission may be distributed publicly free of any fee." So...  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> Microsoft has to be a bit careful, because this is a *formal* proposal from that corporation to an industry consortium of which they're a member - they have to play by the rules, which I think say that proposals are initially available only to members.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I think that MS would agree that it would be a good thing to make this available to us - I'll ask around.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, we just create XML, we cannot, nor should we want to, control what people do with it.  </s>

<s> Yes, but the playwright sits in on rehearsals and is consulted for changes in the script.  </s>
<s> Union rules.  </s>
<s> We can't adopt or count on what we can't see.  </s>
<s> If those are the consortium rules, we are definitely building this under the wrong aegis.  </s>

<s> I'm happy to accept the ERB's conclusion, but will require some method of searching through a node once it has been reached by a TEI pointer.  </s>
<s> Is this completely application-specific, or is there a way (FOREIGN not being allowed) to apply (say) a Java method to the node contents?  </s>
<s> It could be worthwhile to converge towards a standard syntax, because this will be a common requirement and general XML applications/browsers will need to recognise it.  </s>
