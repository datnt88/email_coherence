<s> Hi. I've downloaded amaya-4.0.tgz &amp; amaya-3.2.1.tgz and tried to compile on NetBSD 1.5, but it failed because HTML.S was (and maybe other *.T *.P files were) missing.  </s>
<s> Am I supposed to write those files by ourselves?  </s>
<s> Or can I find them in the net?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> All these files are in the source tar file.  </s>
<s> I guess you just omitted to create a object subdirectory Amaya/$your-object-directory and to move into this directory to launch "../configure".  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Hello. Thanks for the advise.  </s>
<s> Sorry that I didn't read the web page precisely.  </s>
<s> And I am also found another problem with compiling HTMLedit.c.  </s>
<s> It failed with the messages something like: in function 'UpdateAtom': HTMLedit.c:  </s>
<s> 2720: called object is not a function.  </s>
<s> The problematic line is: win = XtWindow (XtParent( XtParent (XtParent (frame)))); # The build succeeded &amp; and the binary displayed the # W3C site pretty well when I commented out the line.  </s>
<s> This happened with both Amaya 3.2.1 &amp; Amaya 4.0.  </s>
<s> I use NetBSD-1.5beta  </s>
<s> (i386) and lesstif, and I have little experience in X Window programming.  </s>
<s> I hope I am not asking a silly question again.  </s>
