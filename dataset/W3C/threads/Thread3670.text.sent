FYI. Some good news :) I sent out a pointer to our planned article "Serving XHTML"[1] on a team-only horizontal list as a heads up.

Karl is co-chair of the W3C QA WG. "Very cool stuff and very cool designed. 
It's pleasant to see things like this happening. 
When you are ready, we should announce it on public-evangelist."

I've found this paper about DOCTYPEs. 
May be to be linked to from your article? 
( It also contains link to translations in many other languages.) NT Najib TOUNSI (mailto:tounsi@w3.org)

I was aware of that article, but it is quite old so I didn't add it. 
I did however, just add some more links to the article: a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html" 
List of valid DTDs you can use in your document /a And a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/reference/prolog_problems.html" whet her [xml prologs] will be an issue for you /a Btw, note that Karl sent out my www-international announcement to the public-evangelist@w3.org list.
