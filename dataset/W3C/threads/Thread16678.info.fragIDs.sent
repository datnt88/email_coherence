<s> Hi everyone  </s>
<s> I am sure most of you are already aware that Tim has been awarded the Japanese prize for the invention of the World Wide Web.  </s>
<s> For those of you who are  </s>

<s> The only problem with this is that Tim Berners-Lee did NOT invent the  </s>
<s> World Wide Web, or even a very significant part of it.  </s>
<s> What Tim did was take a few well-known ideas and give them a new twist.  </s>
<s> Then he showed his work to others and asked them what they thought.  </s>
<s> And he got plenty of response.  </s>
<s> Over the years as the WWW grew in complexity and importance, literally thousands of people contributed to its "invention."  </s>
<s> When you say "World Wide Web" to someone today, how much of what they associate with that term was actually contributed by Tim?  </s>
<s> It is a disease of our society -- perhaps caused by our worship of the individual (and particularly of "celebrities") -- that we invariably strive to give to one person the credit that truly belongs to a group of people.  </s>
<s> Tim has played a key role in the invention of the Web, and for that he richly deserves praise.  </s>
<s> But he did not "invent" it.  </s>
<s> And my guess is that if you asked him, he'd tell you this himself.  </s>
<s> He has never impressed me as a credit hog.  </s>
<s> (While I'm at it, Linus Torvalds did not "invent" Linux either.) Sincerely, Charles F. Munat Seattle, Washington  </s>
<s> World Wide Web, or even a very significant part of it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your elaboration on that point Charles.  </s>
<s> I was not expressing a personal view just citing the actual headlines of the article i.e. "Berners-Lee wins Japan Prize for invention of World Wide Web" - their words not mine.  </s>
<s> I too have a problem with the notion that one individual invented the WWW.  </s>
<s> Perhaps your are right, our society has some kind of need to single out individuals and has a problem accepting that some of the greatest achievements are the results of collaborative endeavor and evolution of the ideas of many contributors over time.  </s>
<s> Regardless of the accuracy of the article, it is a fantastic achievement for Tim Berners-Lee :-) Denise Dr Denise L Wood Lecturer: Professional Development (online teaching and learning) University of South Australia CE Campus, North Terrace, Adelaide SA 5000 Ph: (61 8) 8302 2172 / (61 8) 8302 4472 (Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays) Mob: (0413 648 260) WWW:http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/staff/homepage.asp?Name=Denise.Wood  </s>
