<s> Hi everyone, I am looking for information about the current state of the web.  </s>
<s> I have heard figures bandied about that the web is 90 to 99.9 % inaccessible, and would like to know how these were arrived at.  </s>
<s> I was particularly hoping that somebody might know of a web survey that catalogues the problems of the web.  </s>
<s> The only one I have been able to get my hands on was done in 1996, and in web time that puts it about two decades ago!  </s>
<s> ( I once heard that web years last 2.6 months) If any of you nice guys out there feel like helping out, I would be very grateful.  </s>
<s> Thanks Gareth Parkinson  </s>
<s> Please try to define your request.  </s>
<s> accessiblity is not itself defined as yet.  </s>
<s> I teach adults who are mostly non readers and have learning difficulties.  </s>

<s> I thought you might like to know the following one of my students is very keen on wordsearches, (note that the meaning of the words is not required) She found a suitable website within minutes unaided and has had minimal experience of using the www.  </s>
<s> one of her own creations will be on our homepage this weekend.  </s>
<s> another equally able and experienced student was looking for a map of the UK. after half an hour, I started to help a little harder, and we eventually found  </s>
<s> a rather useless and very small one.  </s>
<s> I realize this does not help generalise issues, however I do feel that it is important for us to discuss the means of access as well as html and indeed xml.  </s>
<s> symantics is not a suitable metaphor it is the limbic system I seek, seat of the emotions.  </s>

<s> On the other hand, in the market of educational CDs and toys you will find many contenders: computer-accessible atlases and interactive globes.  </s>
<s> Don't be surprised at this.  </s>
<s> End-user data speeds are still generally inadequate for the delivery of high quality maps.  </s>
<s> xml.  </s>
<s> I hope, as a teacher, that you are not solely concerned with emotions.  </s>
<s> The current Consumer Reports has an interesting review of educational products as possible gifts.  </s>
<s> They rated them separately on fun and "problem-solving."  </s>
<s> I would guess that you want to keep fun above some minimum and then maximize the problem-solving value of the experience, once the fun level is acceptable.  </s>
<s> I understand that for many of your clients the web just isn't enough fun yet to keep them at it.  </s>

<s> Of course emotion is not all, however the approaches currently outlined in the guidelines tend to reflect the concerns of the programmers rather than the interests of observers.  </s>
<s> People commenting on the huge success of certain sites, eg blairproject or that famous film review site, would not usually refer to point 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.  </s>
<s> recognisig that this is not inspiring fayre for the general punter.  </s>
<s> The difference, between finding maps and wordsearches has little to do with graphic image sites.  </s>
<s> rather that describing a map with words is not trivial, and that any wordsearch will do, but one is looking for a particular map.  </s>
