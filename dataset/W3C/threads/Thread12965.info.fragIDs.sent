<s> Andrew, all, the problem Sylvie is having with the summary of the table comes from the fact you are using carriage returns for formatting the attribute visually (#10 is the carriage return in ASCII or hex, I do not remember which one).  </s>

<s> 1st Table: I think there should be a "YES" in the crossing of "Device Independence" and "Low Bandwidth".  </s>
