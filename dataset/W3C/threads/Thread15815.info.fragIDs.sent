<s> Greetings, The new website for number 10 Downing street was launched recently as part of the UK government's "IT for All" initiative.  </s>
<s> It is, by a long stretch, the most astonishingly inaccessible site I have ever experienced.  </s>
<s> Below is a letter which Iain Logan has sent to the Prime Minister's Office, followed by the Observer article to which he refers.  </s>
<s> The reason I am cross-posting this is to gather some hard evidence about just how inaccessible it is, and, from the HTML experts, precisely what is wrong.  </s>
<s> I shall of course run it through Bobby but need some human intelligence too.  </s>
<s> With this evidence, I am fairly confident of some truly useful awareness raising, by which I mean national publicity, with the basic message being: "This was clearly an oversight, but look at the consequences and the potential benefits of putting it right".  </s>
<s> Compare this with the Whitehouse site which is, by contrast, astonishingly accessible.  </s>
<s> I look forward to reactions and especially analysis.  </s>
<s> Regards.  </s>

<s> Alia alia est.  </s>
<s> [The email address for No. 10 is PCartwright@pmo.gov.uk in case you missed my CIWAH posting] Dear Prime Minister, The No. 10 Downing Street Website I am writing to express my deep concern about some very serious accessibility problems affecting your website.  </s>
<s> I was alerted to this by an article by John Naughton in yesterday's 'Observer', and duly confirmed it by several personal visits to the site, and a subsequent posting to the web authoring newsgroup on the internet, which has elicited a prodigious response.  </s>
<s> Put simply, as the site now stands, it will be difficult or impossible for many blind and disadvantaged webnauts to gain access to it, and to participate in the forthcoming debate.  </s>
<s> I am sure Mr. Blunkett would be able to confirm this were he to visit using a speaking web browser.  </s>
<s> For the last eighteen months I have been active, both professionally and privately, in the cause of preserving the concept of universal access to the wonderful resource that is the web, just as was originally envisaged by its British creator.  </s>
<s> This is now actively under seige by commercial interests with a very different agenda.  </s>
<s> I am certain that it is their influence that has led directly to the accessibility problems with your website.  </s>
<s> Likewise, I am sure you will be as astonished and appalled as I was when the implications of this situation become clear to you.  </s>
<s> Few things in life are worse than bad things being done in the name of a good man.  </s>
<s> May I please ask you to look into this as a matter of urgency.  </s>
<s> To assist, I am attaching some (rather technical, I'm afraid) references which will lead to the relevant facts, and aid in putting things right.  </s>
<s> If I may be of any further assistance, I shall be delighted to help.  </s>
<s> Wishing you every success in the future, (etc., etc.) Attached: A reference to the CIWAH thread cited in the heading.  </s>

<s> All the best, Iain Iain Logan, Langholm, Dumfriesshire - Chartered Transport Consultant (From the Observer, 19 April 1998) Hello, good evening and welcome to Tony Blair.  </s>
<s> By JOHN NAUGHTON One day in December 1996, I ran into John Major, as one does.  </s>
<s> Or rather, he and his ministerial entourage ran into me.  </s>
<s> It was in the basement of the DTI building in Victoria Street.  </s>
<s> He was still Prime Minister at the time, though to read the Daily Telegraph you would never have believed it.  </s>
<s> I was there to talk about the Internet.  </s>
<s> 'Ah, the Internet,' said he. 'Norma and I were talking about interior decor at the weekend and I said: 'I bet there's a lot about that on the Internet!' 'As a matter of fact, Prime Minister, there is,' I said.  </s>
<s> 'Would you like to see for yourself?' Whereupon one of my colleagues typed 'interior decor' into a search engine while the PM turned to talk to someone else.  </s>
<s> 'Prime Minister, Prime Minister!' yelled one of his ministerial colleagues as AltaVista spewed out a million links, 'come and look at this.' 'Well, well,' said Major, staring in amazement at the wonders of modern technology.  </s>
<s> This happened at the launch of Major's 'IT for All' campaign which seems to have achieved little beyond publishing surveys showing that some Brits are keen on IT while others are not.  </s>
<s> Last Thursday, Tony Blair launched his IT for All campaign.  </s>
<s> According to the blurb it's 'the biggest IT training and investment programme ever undertaken by a British government'.  </s>
<s> The campaign has an eight-point 'strategy for the Information Age' to boost IT training and 'deliver greater access to computers in schools, libraries and hospitals (hospitals???)'.  </s>
<s> At the same time, the Prime Minister unveiled Blairweb, the new Number 10 web site (www.  </s>
<s> number-10.  </s>
<s> gov.  </s>
<s> uk/) and announced that he will take part in Europe's first live Internet interview with a Government leader.  </s>
<s> The historic 'webcast' will be conducted by Sir David Frost, no less, and will go out live on 29 April.  </s>
<s> Well, it will be kind of live: the majority of the questions will be received and vetted in advance, though Downing Street does not rule out the possibility of an unscheduled query.  </s>
<s> The revamped Number 10 site, like the Government, reeks of designer chic.  </s>
<s> Like the Government, it also needs a bit more work.  </s>
<s> There's a box labelled 'UK Today' for example, which contains a scrolling message saying '(Font face= 'Arial' size = 2)(p)Microsoft DB provider for ODBC drivers (/font)' and so on.  </s>
<s> Still, there's an interesting virtual tour of Number 10, and a nice picture of Tony's hero, Mrs Thatcher.  </s>

<s> Jolly rotten show, that, I say!  </s>
<s> :-) Well, luckily I was able to get a little farther than that with JAWS For Windows and MSIE3.02.  </s>
<s> I was able to navigate among pages using the "shortcut to" links, &amp; even filled out the registration form for the "Interactive" part of the site.  </s>
<s> However, there is very little text information anywhere.  </s>
<s> For instance, the reasons WHY I should want to register for the interactive discussions &amp; so forth are never explained.  </s>
<s> I also found a link to the Accomodations and Works Committee of Parliament, with the E-mail address of its clerk, Mr. Moon.  </s>
<s> Can any of our UK contributors tell us whether this committee is responsible for production of the Web site or would handle disability-related concerns, or does "accomodation" mean something completely different?  </s>
<s> It's possible that this committee is simply at the top of an alphabetical list-box display.  </s>
<s> The larger issue that is raised by this page is the use of Javascript.  </s>
<s> I have encountered some other sites like this recently, where (as far as I can tell) the only thing the HTML does is define frame boundaries.  </s>
<s> All the actual content is carried by Java scripts or applets or somethingorothers.  </s>
<s> Has the team at Sun or anyone else thought about how to tackle these situations?  </s>
<s> The pages I have run across where this seems to be the problem were created with GoLive Cyberstudio or Net-It, if that helps at all.  </s>
<s> In the case of the 10 Downing Street site, I suppose some of the complaints should be sent to the folks who get credit for creating the pages: Oyster Fanks, Guv, Patrick  </s>
<s> I had a look at it in Lynx and was extremely disappointed.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I thought the Kent state worked pretty well.  </s>
