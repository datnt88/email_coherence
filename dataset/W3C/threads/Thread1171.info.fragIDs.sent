<s> Neither. Tidy has an internal pull API to tokenize an input stream into tokens (start tags, end tags, processing instructions, ...) and builds a tree from these tokens.  </s>
<s> The actual conversion from HTML to XHTML involves just adding some attributes (xml:lang, xmlns) and changing the document type declaration ( !DOCTYPE ...), these are tree modifications.  </s>
<s> Finally there is a XHTML pretty printer that takes care of using proper XHTML syntax.  </s>
<s> If you are looking into using Tidy from other applications, the public API is dom-like but not really W3C DOM and also very very limited, you cannot change most of parts of the document and you cannot access the content of text and similar nodes.  </s>
<s> To create xhtml from html (I think - correct me if I'm wrong): TidyDoc tdoc=tidyCreate(); tidyOptSetBool(tdoc, TidyXhtmlOut, TRUE); tidyParseFile(tdoc, "htmldoc.html");  </s>
<s> tidyCleanAndRepair(tdoc); tidySaveFile(tdoc, "xhtmldoc.html");  </s>
