InternetWeek Online February 12, 2001 Editor's Note Making Sites Accessible Makes Sense For All Customers By ROBERT PRESTON A year ago, InternetWeek columnist Bill Frezza was blasted with hate mail after he dared question a government plan to penalize Web sites that don't provide equal access for the disabled. 
Frezza's point--one not fully appreciated by many readers--was that the ensuing regulatory, tort and special-interest quagmire would swamp the measure's societal benefits. 
What everyone may have underestimated at the time was industry's proclivity to get on board--not necessarily because companies fear government sanctions, not necessarily because helping the disabled is "the right thing to do," but because improving access for the disabled improves access for everyone, serving companies' broader interests. 
E-businesses, as well as the IT vendors that supply them, stand to score more than a handful of new customers and publicity points by redesigning their sites, applications, keyboards and other IT access points for the physically impaired. 
For one thing, 54 million Americans--who represent $1 trillion in disposable income--have some form of disability, reports associate editor L. Scott Tillett in his page 1 story on the government's accessibility requirements. 
And by making their products easier to use or their sites easier to navigate, companies cater to all of their customers, not just those with handicaps. 
For instance, onboard computers in cars may one day take data from an "accessibly designed" Web site and turn it into computer-generated speech for drivers who may want to access directions or other site information without pulling over. 
Another accessibility technique involves separating Web content from presentation so visually impaired users can change the font size or contrast of text. 
E-businesses should be moving in that direction anyway to make their sites more hospitable for users of small-screen wireless devices or to let all of their customers customize their Web experiences. 
IBM and other IT vendors call this the "trickle-down effect" of designing products that help federal agencies comply with Section 508 of the Workforce Investment Act, due to take effect this summer. 
Vendors will create only one set of products instead of a government (disabled-aware) version and a nongovernment (disabled-averse) version. 
That unified product development, in turn, will make it cost-effective for all companies to retrofit their operations with content presentation and IT accessibility improvements for customers and employees. 
It's a great opportunity to rethink how you interact with those key constituencies. 
Fidelity Investments, for one, is doing just that, independent of any federal mandate. 
Meantime, what Frezza warned about a year ago--a wave of debilitating lawsuits aimed at e-businesses and IT shops--is indeed on the horizon. 
Last year the National Federation of the Blind dropped a lawsuit against America Online after the company agreed to make version 6 of its software accessible to screen readers, but more litigation based on the 508 standards is likely come summertime. 
The carrot is always a better incentive than the stick. 
Start evaluating the accessibility of your Web and IT infrastructure now because it's a smart business move, not because of government or legal threats.

Sounds familiar, like what some are asking developers to do if they have JavaScript on their pages, or worse yet, applets. 
Last I checked [1][2] Lynx was less than 1% of browsers JavaScript was used on 37.45% of sites Sounds like a lynx problem to me.

Regards, Phill the lynx 1 percent is a bit off because if lynx hits a sight that it cannot access, it is not even logged. the intent here was to possit access solutions not to field domenance. 
Sure, it is a lynx problem, but it cannot be solved as easily as the solutions currently at hand can be implemented by authors.
