Hi, We have made an application based on Thot library. 
We would like to port it on Windows. 
We are using the library and the Makefile from Amaya's distribution to compile it. 
The application is running, but there are no windows : We can't show the main window, which allows us to open some files. 
This is the same window as the first window we show in ThotEditor. 
(We can show this window in the Linux version). 
The question is : How can we get this window to be shown? 
In general, has Thot's porting on Windows been made specifically for Amaya, or is it available for any other application based on the Thot library? 
Is there some documentation about Thot's porting on Windows? 
(I have read the page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html) 
Thank's for your answer.

Did you follow the Amaya build procedure to compile your application: build compilers, execute compilers to produce schemas files and then build the final application ? 
Ramzi.

said: Porting a Thot application on windows is not so straightforward : First, you have to define resources for dialogues windows used in the application since TtaNewSheet and cie are not handled the same way in Win code of thotlib. 
Secondly, As amaya does not show an application window like Thot editor does, the code that builds the main window has not been ported to windows. 
you should patch the TtaInitDialogueWindow fuction to map the main window when it is called with the param number set to zero (for now it simply exits the function). 
(this function is in thotlib/dialogue/dialogapi.c) 
Third, you have to write a makefile for the schemas you are using. 
And use Ramzi's compile tool to build the schemas. 
For the moment we have no plans to port Thot editor on Windows, but if you wish to help in that way let us know, it could be a great application ! 
Hope this helps.

In fact, I'm able to add some buttons with bitmap from amaya, but I don't manage to put my own bitmap : I can't find where the bitmap is loaded. 
Thank's for your answer.

Hi Eric, The person in charge of the Amaya Windows interface is traveling this week. 
I can just give you some explanations today and he will give you more next week. 
To create buttons we use the standard Windows resource editor. 
We identify each button by its order entry in the resource toolbar. 
The application gives the button indentification to create and manage that button with the Thot toolkit (TtaAddButton, etc.). 
I hope this can help. 
Irene.
