<s> Long story short: Food for thought : local communities, city hall, city library, school, university, etc. might be a good target for punctual evangelism effort.  </s>
<s> Long story not so short: Yesterday I visited my city's website: http://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp/  </s>
<s> Yes, I know, it's all in japanese, but did you see the icons?  </s>
<s> Yes, the page is actually made with valid HTML and CSS.  </s>
<s> At first I went "wow, my city's cool, I always knew it!".  </s>
<s> Then I figured out how pathetic it was to be enthusiast just because, for once, I had found a valid webpage that wasn't owned/written by a geek.  </s>
<s> Why do geeks validate their webpages?  </s>
<s> Because they're cool.  </s>
<s> Sure, sure.  </s>
<s> But certainly they did that because they know this guy who has a friend who knows someone that has been at a conference with a speaker who read a book by someone who once heard about the validator, or read an article.  </s>
<s> Or something like that.  </s>
<s> The point is, web geeks do validate because someone convinced them to do so.  </s>
<s> Of course "web geeks" are easier to convince than "web designers" (sorry if this sounds pejorative), but there are other ways to ease the evangelism work than "good will".  </s>
<s> Starting with proximity.  </s>
<s> It's always easier (sorry, this is my non-geek side speaking, won't happen again) to convince someone when you can chat with this person face-to-face, in front of a coffee.  </s>
<s> Those of us who have tried to explain "why this is the right way" by sending a 'nice, polite, informative e-mail with loads of links to comprehensive resources'(TM) know what I'm talking about.  </s>
<s> The web doesn't want to grow up, because it's not funny becoming an adult when everyone remains a child.  </s>
<s> In other words, if we want to beat the "I don't care about valid HTML, no-one does" logic, we need to find a base of sites that are likely to cooperate.  </s>
<s> "Public" sites are a good target, for two reasons : - proximity : you can actually go see the person in charge of the web and offer to help (offer a coffee too, it helps ;) - quality constraints : it may sound manichean, but where the private sector is driven by marketing (hence the "go to hell, my customer base uses IE5/NS4/your-browser-here" typical answer), the public sector has some obligations towards quality.  </s>
<s> An obvious example is section 508 for accessibility of govt-funded sites in the USA.  </s>
<s> There is space for a nice initiative where volunteers would (try to) convince local authorities to improve the quality of their websites, and possibly helping them to do so (there's no better argument to convince public authorities than benevolent work offers :).  </s>
<s> Annex project would be (yes, again) writing a little paper with key information to explain to those "people in charge".  </s>
<s> I'm confident (maybe optimistic) that it wouldn't take a full business cases kit.  </s>
<s> Thoughts, anyone?  </s>
<s> Cheers. olivier.  </s>

<s> Yes. Clean this up a bit and publish it under a title along the lines of "Think Globally, Act Locally" (which is the essence of your essay).  </s>
<s> This, along with Dom's "Business Case" paper, makes a good start at a community pool of resources for evangelism.  </s>
<s> Terje, you are a sick and twisted individual, and I think I speak for all of us when I say, "Thank you!" -- John Gruber gruber@barebones.com  </s>
<s> Why not.  </s>
<s> Here's the article : http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/08/LocalAction  </s>
<s> Still quite draft-y and tainted with the "mail" tone but that's a start.  </s>
<s> Comments on how to improve it welcome.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the title, Terje :) Regards, olivier Olivier Thereaux - W3C  </s>
