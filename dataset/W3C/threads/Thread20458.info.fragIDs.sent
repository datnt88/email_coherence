<s> Hi, Yes I get this quite often: When doing the back-one-word Command (Ctrl-LeftArrow) Amaya crashes (Version 5.3) This happens only every onece in a while.  </s>
<s> And as I recall it happens when the cursor is at the end of an element (usualy a paragraph).  </s>
<s> I also noted, that there is no Command back-one-word in the doc for keyboard shortcuts and the "Ctrl Key Left" does not apperar in the keyboard file amaya.kb.  </s>
<s> I believe I experienced a similar problem, but only once.  </s>
<s> Hi; I've noticed the same when holding the del key down...  </s>
<s> I don't know whet it happens; I can't give any reason.  </s>

<s> I guess I fixed that case of crash in the CVS version.  </s>
