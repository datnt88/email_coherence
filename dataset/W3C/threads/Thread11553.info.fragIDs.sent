<s> Dear tranlation teams,  </s>
<s> The translation of the HTML Specification represents an ideal  </s>
<s> opportunity to *specify* how to mark-up HTML with the objetive of having  </s>
<s> (aligned) *multilingual parallel texts*.  </s>
<s> Document marked in such a way  </s>
<s> will be easy to compare to check the correctness of the translation, harvesting terminology and other Language Engineering applications.  </s>
<s> Interested parties please have a look to the relevant sections of the lapsed Interned-Draft:  </s>
<s> Regards Tomas  </s>
<s> Hello Thomas,  </s>
<s> I think that most of the facilities needed for parallel text can  </s>
<s> be provided by keeping the file structure and the identifiers (HTML ID attributes) in the translations the same as in the original.  </s>
<s> Parallel traversals then become rather easy to implement on a browser (if you have the source code, or maybe with something such as Java and/or DOM).  </s>
<s> What are translators currently doing with respect to ID attributes?  </s>
<s> Do you also translate them, or do you keep them as is?  </s>
<s> As for HTML 4.0, most of these references are chapter/section numbers or tag names, so there seems to be no point in translating them.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>

<s> This is what I have in mind: nothing new from an HTML point of view, just using the existing mechanism in a certain way (it would  </s>
<s> more  </s>
<s> than the ID, but not much more).  </s>
<s> In other words, every document  </s>
<s> for parallel text must conform to HTML.  </s>
<s> One needs a specification  </s>
<s> [Carrasco Benitez Manuel]  </s>
<s> A few definitions:  </s>
<s> "Parallel Texts Texts that are translations of each other.  </s>
<s> For example, the Treaty of Rome in English and Spanish are Parallel Texts.  </s>
<s> Parallel Texts could be aligned to several levels.  </s>
<s> Alignedness It is a quality of Parallel Texts; for example, the Treaty of Rome in English and Spanish are Parallel Texts and they should be aligned.  </s>
<s> The interesting part is aligning Parallel Texts automatically.  </s>
<s> Level of Alignedness This is a metric of alignedness.  </s>
<s> According to which depth it is possible to identify the Linguistic Objects, the texts are aligned at: Document level: the trivial case; i.e., Parallel Texts.  </s>
<s> Paragraph level: not too hard to achieve.  </s>
<s> Sentence level: desirable and possible to achieve.  </s>
<s> Term level: it needs tagging for automatic alignedness.  </s>
<s> Word level: it needs tagging for automatic alignedness.  </s>
<s> In this context, sentence is a part of a text delimited by a dot, semicolon or similar; i.e., it has little grammatical meaning and the main interest is to identify Linguistic Objects."  </s>
<s> Parallel texts without any marking are parallel text.  </s>
<s> But parallel texts with marking can be *easily* aligne (without the use of more costly techiques such as linguistic, statistics, etc) and the result is *certain* (i.e., this sentece is the translation of this one because the marking around say so).  </s>
<s> [Carrasco Benitez Manuel] Without specifications there would be many different marking system (the same from a functional point of view).  </s>
<s> With a  </s>
<s> specification, there are more chances that the would be compatible products, that the main stream browsers include aligning capacities, etc.  </s>
<s> From here, other Language Engineering technique could follow; e.g, automatic harvesting of Linguistic Objetcs (terms, senteces, etc).  </s>
<s> The bottom line is to reduce the cost of translation (translation is very expensive) and to increase the quality.  </s>
<s> I think it would be very good if you could take a very small example text, translate it to another language or two, add the markers that you think you need, and make a web site out of it that you can give people to have a look at.  </s>
<s> [Carrasco Benitez Manuel] Execellent idea.  </s>
<s> I could take a small section in two languages (e.g., English and Spanish) and mark it up.  </s>

<s> Hello Tomas, Many thanks for your mail.  </s>
<s> Thanks for copying these in.  </s>
<s> I remember them very well.  </s>
<s> What is needed in addition to DIV , SPAN , and ID, in HTML?  </s>
<s> If anything more, how should it look like?  </s>
<s> What would prevent a small browser company from producing a browser  </s>
<s> with alignement capacities?  </s>
<s> What's the reason nobody seems to do it?  </s>
<s> That's very interesting.  </s>
<s> It could help search engines.  </s>
<s> The problem is that in many cases, the original authors don't know that the document will be translated (the EU in this respect may be an exception).  </s>
<s> So the original authors don't think about how to make translations easier.  </s>
<s> I'm seeing this almost weekly now, with a very small example, the W3C press releases.  </s>
<s> For the last few (XML REC, MathML PR, CSS2 PR), they were translated here into Japanese, and they are served language-negotiated, as it should be.  </s>
<s> The main problems are: - That we don't get final enough versions early enough (is getting better) - That there are too many "buzzwords", and they are extremely difficult to translate if you don't know all the technical content.  </s>
<s> - Also, that "buzzwords" may be okay for the US press, but not for the Japanese press, for various reasons.  </s>
<s> - That for the Japanese, different things may be of interest.  </s>
<s> So e.g. in the case of XML, we just did a rewrite.  </s>
<s> The document is parallel, but below that, not much of a chance for alignement.  </s>
<s> I think it would be very good if you could take a very small example text, translate it to another language or two, add the markers that you think you need, and make a web site out of it that you can give people to have a look at.  </s>
