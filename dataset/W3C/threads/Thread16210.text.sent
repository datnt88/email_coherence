Extending the Web to voice-based devices reached a milestone Monday when the World Wide Web Consortium accepted version 1.0 of the Voice Extensible Markup Language specification. 
Sounds great. 
Can anyone clarify the status? 
The latest I can find at www.w3.org/tr/voicexml as of May 5 indicates it was received but not even a proposed recommendation yet. 
Is there more recent docs on this?

Kathleen, Steven, Please look at for a clearer portrayal of what "acknowledgement of a submission" by W3C means. 
General information on work that the W3C has already been doing in the area of voice browsing is available at Any work on this topic must go through the same consensus-development process as other W3C work, including W3C working drafts, last call, candidate recommendation, proposed recommendation, etc., before becoming a W3C Recommendation. 
Information on W3C process in general is available at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process . 
Regards, - Judy a proposed recommendation yet.

It's vague enough that the VoiceXML's PR people probably didn't feed DELIBERATE lies, but they are clearly trying to play up this "accomplishment." 
The "acceptance" of a submitted paper by the W3C doesn't mean diddly squat as far as it becoming a proposed recommendation -- there have been many proposals submitted to the W3C before that have gone absolutely nowhere, or have been incorporated into further work in bits and pieces, certainly not adopted wholesale. 
Also, the quote from Jim Larson, the chair, seems to be a partial one; he specifically described VoiceXML as a "model" for how they'll built their recommendation, but this story uses the term "basis", which has a different connotation in English. 
Basically, the purpose of this story seems to be to generate more buzz for VoiceXML, and not to report on an upcoming standard; if it were an actual recommendation from the W3C, the press release would have come from the W3C offices, not from VoiceXML's. 
For reference: From: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#SubmissionYes 
The acknowledgment of a Submission request does not imply that any action will be taken by W3C. 
It does not imply an endorsement by W3C, the W3C Team, or any of the Members of W3C. 
It merely records publicly that the Submission request has been made by the submitting Member. 
The specification may not be referred to as "work in process" of the W3C.

The article uses all the right words, such as "acknowledged receipt of" and "The W3C's acceptance of VoiceXML 1.0 will accelerate and expand the reach of the Internet by ... " but as the W3C process document says, receipt and acceptance does not equate to "W3C recommendation" - at least not yet.
