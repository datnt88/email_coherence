<s> If the literal is intended to be a number, then I think yes.  </s>
<s> But a possible issue then would be that RDF engines without knowledge of XML schema datatypes would get different answers from engines that do have such knowledge.  </s>
<s> I don't know if that's a problem.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... I'd need to consult XML schema details for that.  </s>
<s> And what about: In this case I think the answer is no. (For reasons mentioned in the message Dan cited recently -- The question raised, I think, is does constructing the correct abstract graph depend on knowing about the datatypes?  </s>
<s> If so, then I think extensibility has just been comprehensively denied.  </s>
<s> (Which is not too surprising, if one considers the way programming languages typically distinguish syntactically between literal types -- the range of literal types is often prescribed by the language, though complex values may sometimes be constructed from them.) #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> First, a big "hooray" on this.  </s>
<s> It might be less glamorous than some of the other proposals, but I feel that this offers a huge advantage for the folks out there doing DB/RDF interface work, query, etc.  </s>
<s> The answer is yes.  </s>
<s> However, this raises a question I was trying to figure out a while ago.  </s>
<s> Depending on how schema datatypes are revised, this might be a problem anyway.  </s>
<s> I don't think you can promise anything from an RDF implementation on datatypes it knows nothing about except some default behaviour ("I'll use string comparison") in the absence of any other knowledge.  </s>
<s> That's the killer question I couldn't come up with only one answer to, and I think it's the most important one.  </s>
<s> Do we produce some xsd-influenced hierarchy of idealised types C, R, Q, Z, N or do we take a pragmatic RDBMS-influenced view of having "reals" and "ints" as separate datatypes that don't intersect?  </s>
<s> While I like the former, I've got a suspicion that the latter is a more realistic approach from an implementation point of view*.  </s>
<s> The only thing that makes me feel reasonably happy about the latter view is that we've got some "tradition" in RDF of making intension/extension distinctions explicit and in that vein I'd be reasonably persuaded by "it's an int, dammit, not a bloody real number" when talking about (say) cardinality, number of parents/fingers/mail addresses, etc.  </s>
<s> The other thing that we need to be sure of is the story we tell regarding all the other scenarios and requirements we collected in the (close to) first round of all this.  </s>
<s> We've got (like java) a fixed (? - can we wedge a type theory on top of literals?) set of primitive types, so what about 1. enumerations, 2. compound types, and 3. taxonomic categorisations?  </s>
<s> I'd be happy with saying, "use a uri-labelled resource" for 1 and 3, and "express the structure using nodes and arcs" for 2. jan * I've got a c. 3.5-year-old implementation that went this way; implementation language (java) had a lot to do with that, however.  </s>
