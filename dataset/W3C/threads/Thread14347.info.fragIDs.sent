On Behalf Of Katie Haritos-Shea Sent:Friday, September 08, 2000 2:47 PM Subject:My Action Item VERY LATE sorry Hi All, Jason has already made some of the points that follow, moot, with his revised text of Sept 8th, but I am sending the action item (at the end of this note) anyway. 
Wendy is certainly correct that many of the ideas expressed on this last telecon are a rehashing of what was in the last face-to-face, which was in March, I joined in April, and did not read backwards in the list as I should have. 
I apologize for being thoughtless. 
The Requirements Draft 2.0 clearly says (in 1) that we will address, at least, minimum requirements across new languages (XML), we ensure that the deliverables will be easy to use, and that we will work with EO to write to a more diverse audience. 
And, that we will ensure that it is backwards compatible. 
Now, I more completely understand Wendy's overly polite impatience with our spouting. 
We are wasting valuable time, our public awaits! 
I Like Seeman's idea to clearly state the differences for input and output devices, and how they relate to device independence. 
Wendy, in response to our request to look at The Requirements Draft 2.0, before it is sent off: should we add XSL in the parenthesis of the first bullet (Presentation) of item #1? 
Other than the final wording for backward compatability #6, it looks good to me to let it go. 
To the "usability testing": I met this morning with four collegues from my web-training days, we get together occassionally for brunch to keep up with each others families and careers. 
One will be starting in a new position in her telecom company. 
It is a large company with over 100 offices internationally. 
She is in the number three web position, over seeing a completely new web operation, (rebuilding it) fresh from the ground up, of their intranet, internet, extranet and e-commerce operations. 
Most of the work is going to be entirely outsourced. 
When I asked her if her contracts will include and ensure accessibility, she had no idea of what I was talking about ! 
She agreed, along with a content specialist, and our webmaster training professor, to be guinea pigs. 
I am sending the info off to them now. 
So, to my first action item.................. Greetings, I took on an action item to look at Jason, Wendy &amp; Greggs', "Draft Reformation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" of 23 August 2000..................from a regular Joe's (or Joeinna's, in this case) perspective. 
The approach was, an industry or government CIO, gives their underling (a Webmaster, Manager, Marketing, Training, Janitorial or other individual) the task of " Go find out what this Accessible Web Site issue is, and then do what it takes to get it implemented here on our web sites". 
One can imagine this happening all around the world, if not today then with-in the next year or so. 
First, I did a search on most of the major US search engines on "Accessible Web Design". 
I think this is where many people would start, I am assuming (oh, no!), that they have never heard of the W3C. 
(Yahoo.com, 
Google.com, 
Altavista.com, 
Dogpile.Com, Excite.com, Lycos.com, msn.com, WebCrawler.com, hotbot.com, 
Snap.com. 
Iwon.com, GoTo.com, Looksmart.com, 
FindWhat.com) 
In general, the sites were the expected ones, National Science Foundation, Trace, HTML Writers Guild, NCAM, WDG Web Design Group, WebAIM, disABILITY, useit.com, 
NADC UCLA, UsableWeb, NCSA Univ. of Illinois, WGBH, Starling, AWARE, Ohio State Univ., Univ.of Iowa, DO IT- Univ. of Washington State, Suite 101, Microsoft, Adobe, WebAble, USGA National Mapping Information (Good site!). 
The W3C came up as a link on the homepage on most of these sites. 
The majority of those links led you to the WAI home page, a few to W3C home page, and some to WCAG WG home page. 
Ohio State had a link directly to the Table of Contents of WCAG 1.0. 
Bravo! 
Only one search engine had a direct link to WCAG 1.0....................Yahoo! 
Second, I had several people I know, from various backgrounds (management, new webmasters, students, seasoned html coders, instructors) look at this page (Draft Reformation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), ALL of whom had never been to the W3C. 
I noted their FIRST impressions and then their more detailed written suggestions later. 
(Yes, there are many seasoned html folks who have not heard of the W3C, until now.) Third, I tried to view the page with my freinds perspectives in mind. 
SO.....................what follows are our responses, painful as it may be (I apologize in advance for feather ruffling)..........................here goes. 
(This is assuming that we are successful in getting the exact WCAG 2.0 page to be THE page that is directly linked from all those website home-pages I mentioned above (seems like we have the people with the pull in various organizations to get that done, and I beleive we should !)) 
A.) What is all this stuff at the top of the page? 
B.) What do I know of, or care about, which version this is and how it has changed from the last? 
This information is surely valuable, but it should be placed as a footnote, or somewhere other than the top, or have a very small breif explaination. 
I want to find out how to make my tables accessible, or give a breif to my management team, or write a homework assignment. 
Where is that stuff? 
C.) The "Status" is relevent, but, should be much shorter. 
D.) Each page needs a terse "soundbyte" at the top, telling you what you will find on this page. 
Also links at the TOP to the other pages with alt text (or not), telling exactly what you will find there. 
E.) Need to have quick clear choices when you first hit the page, on where you need to go if you are: a policy maker (non-technical page, executive summary), or, a webmaster (technology specific pages), or, an educator or student (tutorials, power-point presentations, in and out of the 3WC domain) or, a veteran web or software developer (technology specific and all other relevant 3WC documents) or, a regulator/attorney (checkpoints) or, an IT manager (executive summary, checkpoints) F.) As a freind who calls himself a "management weenie" said, " I want a one, two or three page summary, giving me all the information I need to know, to intelligently skim resumes and interview webmasters . 
I don't need or want the technical details, the web people need that, I need to know what must be done (not HOW), to breif my bosses. 
Then I need a checklist to determine if the person I hired did it all, so I can go back to those same bosses, and assure them that their rear-ends are now covered." 
(Can you say, Executive Summary?) G.) Principles 3, 4, and 5 do not have exampled explainations before the Guidelines start, as 1 and 2, do. 
H.) What is a user agent? 
I.) Do not understand those links under principle 1. (* I know that the WAI page covers many of these things but it has that same "get me out of this nightmare" un-welcoming look W3C feel about it*) Katie Haritos-Shea Webmaster, CIW Section 508 Coordinator NTIS/Fedworld Department of Commerce 5285 Port Royal Road Springfield, Virginia, 22161 mailto:kshea@fedworld.gov 
The attachment to your messages are apparently too closely tied to something I've never encountered. 
Is there a way to just send whatever they contain? 
Or put them in plain text or HTML? 
Love.

What is all this stuff at the top of the page? 
WL: I've been wondering about this since these "Recommendations" started catching my attention. 
I gather that there's some absurd bureaucratic "process" reason for it but it's gotten completely ridiculous. 
It would be nice if the boiler plate were stored in some bit bucket and referenced by anyone who became too happy with nice clean pages! 
The W3C can do it, witness the uncluttered piece at but refreshing one (oldie but goodie) at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ - now can't we have something like that? 
Love.
