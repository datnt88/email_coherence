<s> Hallo, My apologies for spamming the list, but this may be an issue while I'm desperate :-) Although I'm using methods that are supposed to be implemented in my browser (IE6) I have failed to populate an HTML document (inside an iframe but it's irrelevant) with an xml document.  </s>
<s> I have tried to replace the html's root with the root of a "DOMDocument"  </s>
<s> (implementation.createDocument is not supported in IE) using the methods cloneNode, swapNode, replaceNode clientside using JavaScript and they all produce an error.  </s>
<s> Errors are like "invalid target element" or "not implemented".  </s>
<s> Am I doing something wrong or is the implementation that causes the problem?  </s>

<s> The DOM does not currently support removing/replacing the root element.  </s>
<s> We're considering changing that in DOM Level 3, but until that gets settled the only portable option is to build a new Document.  </s>
<s> By the way, the "swapNode" method you mentioned is not part of the standard DOM API.  </s>
