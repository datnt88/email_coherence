<s> On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>
<s> A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to yes.  </s>
<s> C.11 Should XML retain SGML's prohibition on multiple attribute-list declarations for the same element (11.3.1) or on multiple declarations for the same attribute (11.3.2)?  </s>
<s> 11.3.1  </s>
<s> no.  </s>
<s> I still think that this simple mechanical DTD transform would be staggeringly useful.  </s>
<s> 11.3.2  </s>
<s> yes.  </s>
<s> I can't even tell what 2 delcarations for one attribute would mean.  </s>
<s> I wish that I could declare one model for an attribute on one element and a different model for the same attribute on another element, but the language surgery would be too intense even for me to advocate it in XML. -- David RE delenda est.  </s>

<s> Yes, both for simplicity in teaching about and reading DTDs, and for conformance with 8879.  </s>
<s> We already have some of this stuff for meta-DTDs, and it seems clear that stuff like it will be in SGML97 (named attribute lists, etc.), but this kind of complexity has no place in a simplified SGML.  </s>
