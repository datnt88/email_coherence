<s> This checkpoint is prioritized as a level 3, meaning that in itself, it does not have a critical effect on an authoring tool's likelihood of producing accessible mark-up.  </s>
<s> However, several limited extensions to this alternative content mechanism (ACM) have the potential to simultaneously meet several higher priority checkpoints and dramatically improve the usability of an access aware authoring tool .  </s>
<s> In particular: 1.  </s>
<s> The ACM should maintain a list of associations between object file names and authored responses to prompts for alternative content (as per checkpoint 2.3.1 [Priority 1]).  </s>
<s> The alternative content may take the form of short strings (i.e. "alt"-text) or pointers to descriptive files (i.e. "longdesc", transcripts, etc.).  </s>
<s> Multiple associations for the same object for different languages or contexts should also be handled.  </s>
<s> 2. The ACM would offer the associated alternative content as a default whenever the appropriate associated object is selected for insertion.  </s>
<s> If no previous association is found the field should be left empty (i.e. no purely rule-generated alternative content should be used).  </s>
<s> Note: the term "default" implies that the alternative content is offered for the author's approval.  </s>
<s> The term does not imply that the default alternative content is automatically placed without the author's approval.  </s>
<s> Such automatic placement may only occur when in situations where the function of the object is known with certainty as per checkpoint 2.3.5 [Priority 1].  </s>
<s> Such a situation might arise in the case of a "navigation bar builder" that places a navigation bar at the bottom of every page on a site.  </s>
<s> In this case, it would be appropriate to use the same "alt"-text automatically for every instance of a particular image (with the same target) on every page.  </s>
<s> 3. The alternative content mechanism should be closely integrated with the pre-written alternative content provided for all packaged multimedia files, as per checkpoint 2.3.3 [Priority 2].  </s>
<s> This would allow the alternative content to be automatically retrieved whenever the author selected one of the packaged objects for insertion.  </s>
<s> An important benefit of the system would be the ease of adding a keyword search capability that would allow efficient location of multimedia based on their alternative content.  </s>

<s> I don't do techniques (just kidding!) This "fleshing out" of the details of an "alternative content mechanism" is a good idea, particularly if the developer is confronted with a working example (a-prompt?).  </s>
