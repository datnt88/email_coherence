<s> re. issue pfps-03, I propose that we not accept it and note that the purpose of the appendix is informative (for a certain class of readers) rather than definitive.  </s>
<s> The document states: "The editor believes that both of these descriptions, and also the closure rules described in section 4, are all in exact correspondence, but only the directly described model theory in sections 1- 3 should be taken as normative."  </s>

<s> Summary: modulo a very small suggested wording change, I agree that Pat's comments do address the issues raised.  </s>
<s> I've added some links to the issues and other material in my commentary below.  </s>
<s> I suggest a minor change to emphasize what I think is the intent here: "... where sss is a built-in datatype that has well-defined lexical and value spaces and a lexical-to-value mapping, and is named sss in ..." (i.e. use "that" rather than "which", indicating that the following phrase is part of the defining expression rather than just additional informnation.)  </s>
<s> Agree. (Hopefully, in time, others will do more work that will allow developers to use this with greater confidence.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile I agree that without it an important class of readers may be excluded.)  </s>

<s> which completes the closure Peter noted was missing.  </s>
<s> I don't understand the second paragraph of Peter's comment, but from the first I think the issue is to formalize the idea that a datatype must provide a URI by which it may be referenced.  </s>
<s> I agree that the text addresses this issue.  </s>
<s> I sketched a derivation of the missing closure in a previous message to rdf-comments: and hence agree that adding closure rdfs12 provides a closure for the entailment noted.  </s>

<s> Might that be helpful?  </s>
<s> I belive that Euler has checked that all the obvious cases are in the closure, BTW.  </s>
