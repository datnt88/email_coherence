re. issue pfps-01, I propose that we accept it, and note that it has been addressed by the following text (between **-**): The datatype map which also contains the set of all pairs of the form http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#sss , sss , where sss is a built-in datatype **which has well-defined lexical and value spaces and a lexical-to-value mapping and** is named sss in XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2], eg decimal, string, is referred to here as XSD. 
re. issue pfps-03, I propose that we not accept it and note that the purpose of the appendix is informative (for a certain class of readers) rather than definitive. 
The document states: "The editor believes that both of these descriptions, and also the closure rules described in section 4, are all in exact correspondence, but only the directly described model theory in sections 1- 3 should be taken as normative." 
re. issue pfps-05, I propose that we accept it and note that it is addressed by rule rdfs1 in section 4.2 of the editor's draft. 
(Jeremy, the cases you mention rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource follow from the range constraints on subClassOf, which require rdfs:Literal and rdfs:Class both to be of type class, then rule 
rdfs7a.) 
re. issue pfps-09, I propose that we accept it and address it with the text in section 3.4 of the editor's draft, viz. 
"RDF provides for the use of externally defined datatypes identified by a particular URIref. 
Formally, let D be a set of pairs consisting of a URIref and a datatype such that no URIref appears twice in the set, so that D can be regarded as a function from a set of URIrefs to a set of datatypes: call this a datatype map." 
re. issue horst-01, I propose that we accept it and address it by reference to the rule rdfs12 in the current editor's draft, together with a note that the proof of the rdfs entailment lemma will discuss issues arising in the subsequent email trail following this comment, with details to be given in a later response.

Pat, Thanks for these. 
That's in 
Looks good to me. 
Comments folks? 
jjc - are you planning to do anything about my suggestion of a note in 
concepts about what datatypes don't work? 
Some evidence that folks find the appendix useful would settle this. 
I've asked on rdf interest. 
jjc? 
Comments? 
How is Herman on this? 
Since his comment is on the correctness of the entailment lemma, maybe we should have updated that before resolving it. 
Brian 
No. The current situation is that: RDF MT states the principles. 
OWL Semantics gives an application of the principles in a list with explanation. 
W3C owes the world a Note or similar on XSD and semantic web. 
I don't think that duplicating the list is sufficient, so propose doing nothing awaiting the Note.

[Brian, as requested...] 
Summary: modulo a very small suggested wording change, I agree that Pat's comments do address the issues raised. 
I've added some links to the issues and other material in my commentary below. 
I suggest a minor change to emphasize what I think is the intent here: "... where sss is a built-in datatype that has well-defined lexical and value spaces and a lexical-to-value mapping, and is named sss in ..." (i.e. use "that" rather than "which", indicating that the following phrase is part of the defining expression rather than just additional informnation.) 
Agree. (Hopefully, in time, others will do more work that will allow developers to use this with greater confidence. 
Meanwhile I agree that without it an important class of readers may be excluded.) 
I agree, though I had to dig to find the full closure, using: rdfs1 + rdfs3 + rdfs7a + rdfs9 rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:range rdfs:Class . 
(sect 3.3 axiom) rdf:XMLLiteral rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal . 
(sect 3.3 axiom) gives: rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class . 
(by rdfs3) gives: 
rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource . 
(by rdfs7a) then, from rdfs1, we have: _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Literal hence: _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Resource (by rdfs9) 
which completes the closure Peter noted was missing. 
I don't understand the second paragraph of Peter's comment, but from the first I think the issue is to formalize the idea that a datatype must provide a URI by which it may be referenced. 
I agree that the text addresses this issue. 
I sketched a derivation of the missing closure in a previous message to rdf-comments: and hence agree that adding closure rdfs12 provides a closure for the entailment noted.

BTW, I could insert an explicit list of the datatypes which DO work, following the list used in the OWL docs. 
Might that be helpful? 
I belive that Euler has checked that all the obvious cases are in the closure, BTW. 
I am pretty sure that the entailment lemma itself is OK, but if you want to wait on this until I finish writing up a proof of it, that would be fine. 
About 2 weeks, provided we don't change the XML literals or the lang tag decisions.
