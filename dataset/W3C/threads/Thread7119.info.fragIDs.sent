<s> For a brief, shining moment, we actually had a discussion of specification text.  </s>
<s> Could we please return to that discussion?  </s>
<s> I point out that this work on RFC2396 is going on without the full formality of an IETF WG (but with the knowledge and consent of the IETF Area Directors and the W3C Director/staff and much of the community[1,2]) on the basis that this community (Fielding as editor and the participants of uri@w3.org) could Just Do It, without need of an explicit chair, charter, and all that.  </s>
<s> But should these mechanics not produce fruit, more formal malarky may be necessary (and it's not clear whether the editing resources would remain available if that had to happen.)

<s> In general, the entities referred 5. to or identified by URIs are called "resources"; this document does 6. not in any way define, specify, or restrict the nature of "resources."  </s>

<s> You said "I refuse to leave what has been deployed in an unspecified state".  </s>
<s> I, among others, asked that you give an example of something that has been deployed and would become unspecified by removing the constraints on the term 'resource'.  </s>
<s> Whether removing constraints on the term 'resource' will increase or decrease the level of debate in the future is anybody's guess.  </s>
<s> I find it hard to believe it would get worse; for example: I have to say that I find the various RFCs on URI syntax incredibly difficult to follow, and in many places ambiguous or contradictory.  </s>
<s> Since there seems to be a belief that URIs are the foundation on which the web is built, I would be much more comfortable if the specs were rock-solid rather than shifting sand.  </s>
<s> With the escape-uri() function (and the rules for URI escaping in XSLT serialization) we've done the best we can, but it's pretty flakey stuff.  </s>

<s> I'm a bit lost here with regard to what is intended by 'Web protocols and languages'.  </s>
<s> What are they?  </s>
<s> But if 'protocol' has anything to do with Internet transport protocols, then 'modem', etc.? In short, is URI something to do with the Internet or something to do with the Web (whatever that might be)?  </s>
