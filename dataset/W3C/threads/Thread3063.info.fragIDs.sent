<s> These notes are taken off the /full/ tests for the 20040510 testsuite tests themselves XML vs XML w NS is determined solely from the "XHTML Full" test list, which says in it "UA must support namespaces for this test" if thats not there, assumed to be both XML and XML w NS.  </s>
<s> I am sure some of these tests do not belong in XML for instance (:checked as on example) though I am basing this list off the impl report itself, and what _is in_ the tests.  </s>
<s> These fixes will be part of my submitted Impl report to Hixie.  </s>
<s> XML (does not belong): 'type' ~ test 182 (listed as namespace needed) universal '*' ~ test 3 (listed as namespace needed) :not ~ test 174b (listed as namespace needed) HTML (does not belong): ~All Belong~ HTML (missing): test 39c (:first-letter with ::before) [to stick in ::before] test 68 (:not) test 69 (:not) ~~Getting Tired, will finish report later tonight or tomorrow Day~~  </s>
<s> ~Justin Wood  </s>
<s> The rest: Most of the missing XML and XMLwNS tests likely don't belong in reality, though they /are/ listed in the XML tests list, so I added them back in for this version of the impl report.  </s>
<s> If they truely do not belong, please remove them from the test-list.  </s>
<s> *NOTES* I did not check the validity of the placement of tests.  </s>
<s> I suggest /this/ implimentation report be updated to reflect this list, though the next iteration of the test-suite should be updated based on what makes sense, (IE: if the tests are there they should be here regardless of if they are correctly placed or not) Missing from XML: single class: tests 13, 155, 155a, 155b, 155c, 155d, 170b, 175a, 175b, 175c, 183 ID '#': tests 4 15 15b descendant ' ': tests 43 43b 181 :link: tests 16 :visited: tests 17 :actve link: tests 19 child ' ': tests 44 44b 44c multi-class '.': tests 14 14b 14c :focus: tests 20 :enabled: tests 23 :disabled: tests 24 :checked: tests 25 :indeterminate: tests d5 d5a d5d :before: 39c :not: tests 68 69 XML w/ NS missing: single class: tests 13, 155, 155a, 155b, 155c, 155d, 170b, 175a, 175b, 175c, 183 ID '#': tests 4 15 15b descendant ' ': tests 43 43b 181 :link: tests 16 :visited: tests 17 :actve link: tests 19 child ' ': tests 44 44b 44c [NS]86 multi-class '.': tests 14 14b 14c :focus: tests 20 :enabled: tests 23 :disabled: tests 24 :checked: tests 25 :indeterminate: tests d5 d5a d5d attribute presence: [NS]104b attribute equality: [NS]105b attribute space set: [NS]106b attribute dashed prefix: [NS]107b :before: 39c attribute prefix: [NS]108b [NS]115b attribute substring: [NS]103b :not: tests 68 69 [NS]124b [NS]126b [NS]128b XHTML (missing): child ' ': 86 attribute presence: 104b attribute equality: 105b attribute space set: 106b attribute dashed prefix: 107b attribute prefix: 108b 115b attribute substring: 103b :not: 124b 126b 128b See: for an updated Template, which I did, also added empty class attributes to every 'a' element to assist impl report creators, feel free to use mine instead of doing the work yourselves, stylesheet link changed to tantek's page rather than downloading the stylesheet locally.  </s>
