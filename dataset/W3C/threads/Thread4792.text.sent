RDF Graph Patterns:: An RDF Graph Pattern is a description of a set of RDF subgraphs. 
If an RDF graph is in the set then it is said to match the graph pattern. 
(If anyone can define 'match' further without getting into defining the expressiveity of the pattern, do suggest something). 
c.f regular expressions and strings - and we get to define the expressivity of the graph pattern expression language. 
Example: Simple case:: RDF Graphs are defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/ in terms of RDF triples. 
An RDF triple pattern is an RDF Triple with the addition that subject, predicate or object can be a named query variable as well as the items defined in "RDF Concepts". 
An RDF Graph Pattern is a set of RDF Triple Patterns. 
A match is an association of RDF graph labels and the variables, such that substituting the labels for variables yields an RDF subgraph of the source RDF graph. 
In matching, if a query variable is used in more than one triple pattern, and/or more than once in a single triple pattern, it must be bound to the same label in any one query solution. 
Discussion:: This is the conjunctive form of graph patterns : its an RDF graph with some of the subject/predicate/object replaced by query variable (not bNodes of the graph). 
If we have disjunction in any form, then just a graph-with-variables isn't enough - we need a construction to express disjunction or (maybe) reify the query pattern. 
This does not say anything about restricting labels matched by value or lexical form. 
There may well be syntactic sugar to make this easier to write but it is equivalent to putting a variable (not part of the results for the variable binding case) into the graph pattern and, separately, writing an expression limiting the range of values for the label. 
I'd like to see a building block being a conjunctive graph pattern with a set of restrictions on labels. 
Andy Sound too general to me. 
For example, one can describe RDF graphs using reification, but I wouldnt want to count that as a 'pattern'. 
Suggest instead your first example as a suitable definition of pattern. 
That would be my definition, not an example. 
That should be part of the definition of 'substitute for a variable'. 
It kind of falls out of he way that RDF graphs syntax is defined in terms of sets rather than as expressions. 
Or think of it as a set of query graph patterns. 
True, but we could accommodate that into this definition of pattern by allowing 'variables' to be more highly structured things, like describing sorted quantification as quantification over sorted variables. 
Sounds about right to me, though I think we need to be very careful to describe those restrictions appropriately. 
One kind of useful restriction might be to a datatype, to constrain literal bindings (?). Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 or (650)494 3973 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501(850)291 0667 cell phayes@ihmc.us

Date: 17 May 2004 18:37 I didn't mean that only patterns describe a set of subgraphs but I take your point. 
What about variable length paths e.g. ?x - p * - ?y (if we want to have them of course). 
A suitable defn os set membership might be OK but it seems a bit contorted. 
(A whiteboard at WWW would sort this out) Agreed. 
Just to check I understand here: we then need operators to pick out the parts of the variables: e.g. lang(?x) to get the lang tag (minor question: what is the type of a lang tag? 
String?). From: Pat Hayes mailto:phayes@ihmc.us 
Date: 17 May 2004 18:37 Well, I'd call that a special kind of variable, but I see that it doesnt fall under that definition. 
OK, here's a second try. 
An RDF graph pattern is defined relative to a set of variable types and binding mappings, and is some entity which may contain some number of variables and which yields an RDF graph when a binding mapping is applied to those variables. 
Variables of a given type may be restricted to certain kinds of binding. 
A simple example is an RDF graph in which some URIrefs have been replaced by variables, and a binding mapping takes a variable to a URIref or literal. 
Yes, except I won't be there. 
Right, or maybe we can think of the variables as having internal structure (so the operators are just selectors). 
Whatever. 
It doesnt really have a type specified. 
I guess if it did have one it would have to be xsd:string, yes. 
Or maybe some special subclass of xsd:string.
