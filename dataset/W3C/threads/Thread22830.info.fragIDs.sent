<s> Hi, It's the 19th so here are some issues and comments with regard to implementing the DOM W3C Candidate Recommendation 10 December, 1999.  </s>
<s> Apologies for the length of the post, but I wanted this material to be archived.  </s>
<s> I've been working on the CSS and Stylesheets OMs.  </s>
<s> The issues are divided into General, CSS and Stylesheets.  </s>
<s> In context, the OM implementations are concerned with accessing CSS, not with how end UA's display CSS.  </s>
<s> Happily there are no showstoppers that I've come across in either OM.  </s>
<s> A number of the issues raised can be dealt with without adjusting the interface signatures, but rather by clarifying the intended semantics and behaviours of certain methods, in the draft and interface comments.  </s>
<s> Anyway... General.  </s>
<s> issue gen-1: There should be a more user friendly way for clients to determine whether a CSSOM or Stylesheet object is read only other than forcing clients to guess and then handle NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR.  </s>
<s> A cleaner, less brittle approach is to allow a query to the objects using an isReadOnly() method prior to attempting a write call, and this could be specified as a general policy.  </s>
<s> Stylesheets.  </s>
<s> issue stylesheets-1 Remove the value 'all' from MediaList.  </s>
<s> I've posted on this subject before (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/1999OctDec/0249.html), with no response (from this list or www-style).  </s>
<s> Again.  </s>
<s> The value 'all' is logically dubious, if not absurd.  </s>
<s> It seems expedient to just eliminate 'all' from both the Stylesheets OM and the CSS specs, and assume that any CSS/stylesheet rule that is not media targeted is applicable to any available end-media that the client UA has available to it.  </s>
<s> In implementation it requires mucking about with list members, and is dependent on one's interpretation of the semantics of 'all'.  </s>
<s> CSS.  </s>
<s> issue css-1: In CSSRuleList.item() why not throw an exception (INDEX_SIZE_ERR), instead of returning null?  </s>
<s> There is a method available to determine the number of rules in the list, and thus no reason to accommodate erroneous clients in this regard.  </s>
<s> issue css-2 DOMImplementationCSS.createCSSStyleSheet() accepts a string of media as its argument, but does not specify that this list is comma delimited, whereas the MediaList object that presumably stores this list insists on a comma separated values.  </s>
<s> Specifying that createCSSStyleSheet() use a CSV string avoids the inefficiency that the string be parsed and rebuilt before sending it to the MediaList.  </s>
<s> issue css-3 In CSSStyleSheet a new rule can inserted using insertRule() but there is no corresponding insertion method available for CSSRuleList, which means you can't use the CSSRuleList interface to delegate inside an implementation of CSSStyleSheet, and thus decouple the implementations.  </s>
<s> issue css-4 CSSMediaRule rule has a deleteRule() method (that applies to a RuleList field), but there is no corresponding deletion method to order a RuleList to delete a rule.  </s>
<s> This is essentially the same problem as described in issue css-3.  </s>
<s> issue css-5 CSSPageRule and CSSStyleRule have precisely the same method signatures.  </s>
<s> This would imply refactoring to a common interface, or renaming the methods if maintaining a logical mapping between interfaces and CSS rules is highly desirable.  </s>
<s> issue css-6 Can CSSStyleDeclaration.setText(String) be used to add new properties?  </s>
<s> The method is not discussed in the draft.  </s>
<s> I think that it can, but a more explicit description would help.  </s>
<s> issue css-7 CSSStyleDeclaration.setText(String) again.  </s>
<s> Is this method essentially an iterated version of setProperty()?  </s>
<s> If so, while a result of the IDL, it's unnecessary, since a client can simply iterate on setProperty().  </s>
<s> Removing it also avoids asking the CSSOM to perform an initial parse into separate arguments for setProperty().  </s>
<s> Taking things a little further, why specify how this object stores its properties at all?  </s>
<s> That is, remove the attribute cssText and turn this interface into a list.  </s>
<s> issue css-8 The availability of a CSSProperty interface would be useful.  </s>
<s> CSSProperties would be stored by a CSSStyleDeclaration styled as a list, which simplifies the construction and adjustment of CSSStyleDeclaration greatly and eliminate issues CSS-7 and css-8.  </s>
<s> issue css-9 CSSPrimitiveValue has a convoluted way of setting its values when its a Counter, RGB or Rect instance, essentially: XX.getRGBValue().getBlue().setFloat(float);  </s>
<s> XX.getRGBValue().getRed().setFloat(float);  </s>
<s> XX.getRGBValue().getGreen().setFloat(float);  </s>
<s> What is the reason for this as opposed to supplying set methods for the three complex instances?  </s>
<s> issue css-10 CSSStyleDeclaration.removeProperty() returns the empty string if it has been given an invalid CSS2 property.  </s>
<s> It seems preferable that an exception(SYNTAX_ERR) is used to inform the client explicitly that it is passing in junk.  </s>
<s> Regards, Bill Bill de hOra : Cromwell Media : London bill@cromwellmedia.co.uk : +44 (0)20 8817 4039  </s>
<s> Hi, Somehow I managed to miss this first time around: issue-css 11 CSSPrimitive.getStringValue()  </s>
<s> says that "this method is used to get the string value in a specified unit.  </s>
<s> " Note that the method does not have such a specified unit argument, as does CSSPrimitive.getFloatValue(short).  </s>
<s> Thus there is either 1) an error in the description, and an unspecified string is returned (change the description) or 2) a missing short argument specifying the desired unit type (change the method).  </s>
<s> regards, Bill Bill de hOra : Cromwell Media : London bill@cromwellmedia.co.uk : +44 (0)20 8817 4039  </s>
<s> Hi, It's well after the deadline now, but I think that this is still worth raising.  </s>
<s> I'm coming to the conclusion that CSSValue and its subclasses need to be audited by the wg.  </s>
<s> The problem is that despite the comments in the draft, CSSValue is a standalone object, and it shouldn't be.  </s>
<s> issue css-12: CSSPrimitive.setFloatValue(short), states in its comments: 'If the property attached with this value can not accept the specified unit or the float value, the value will be unchanged and a DOMException will be raised'.  </s>
<s> There is nowhere in the CSSOM that such a property explicitly exists, other than in arguments into CSSStyleDeclaration, but more of that in a minute.  </s>
<s> The CSSValue object states: 'A CSSValue object only occurs in a context of a CSS property'.  </s>
<s> Since values cannot explicitly refer to their targets, in the object model at least, values *do* occur in the absence of a property.  </s>
<s> The main workaround as things stand is for a client to call the getPropertyValue(DOMString) or getPropertyCSSValue(DOMString) from CSSStyleDeclaration, hold a reference to the argument string and let the client check itself that the new value is sound.  </s>
<s> Apart from being a poorly encapsulated design, this beggars the question of the need for CSSPrimitiveValue's signature to demand an exception in the first place.  </s>
<s> It's also not much use when implementing CSSPrimitiveValue itself.  </s>
<s> How is it to know that the incming unit type is ok?  </s>
<s> As things stand with CSSPrimitiveValue, I can try and induce whether the incoming new value is ok *only* in term of the existing value, *not* the 'attached' property.  </s>
<s> I suggest either a) adding the method getParentProperty(): DOMString to CSSValue.  </s>
<s> A direct reference is of great advantage since a lot of CSSOM processing time is going to be spent manipulating CSSValue and its subclasses.  </s>
<s> Or b) as I have mentioned before, creating a full CSSProperty object, and making CSSStyleDeclaration a list container for such objects.  </s>
<s> Adjustments to values can be controlled from this object.  </s>

<s> Please remove me from the mailing list.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Liz  </s>
