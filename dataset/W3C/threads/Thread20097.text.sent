Hi, when I try to save a document (resulting from using the "make book" feature) with a full URL in the "Document location" field, the web server gets accessed (see server log: proxy unknown - [18/Nov/2000:04:23:23 +0100] "HEAD /prod/book.html 
HTTP/1.0" 404 0 "-" proxy unknown - [18/Nov/2000:04:23:23 +0100] "PUT /prod/book.html 
HTTP/1.0" 401 397 "-" but Amaya (version 3.2, solaris 2) doesn't ask me for a name and a password and instead complains of an error status value of -1. 
So, I installed Amaya 4.0 for solaris 2 and tried to use the "make book" feature, but Amaya crashes with "*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***" Let me know if you need me to do further tests. 
Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.

Hello Bertand, Can you give me some URL or documents for reproducing the make book crash? 
Once I fix this, we can look at the PUT problem. 
Thanks, -jose jose.kahan@w3.org

Hello Bertand, In our previous episode, Bertrand.Ibrahim@cui.unige.ch

I was able to reproduce an error condition. 
The Make book function is written to work synchronously. 
However, the images of the documents were always being requested asynchronously. 
In some cases, it was possible to get back the images after the document context was destroyed. 
This could explain your crash. 
This bug is now fixed. 
There's a second bug as the images are not being shown in the resulting make book. 
We're working on this problem and hope to fix it soon. 
-jose btw, it's a nice tutorial :)
