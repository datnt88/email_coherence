Hi all, I wanted to consult you all on this matter. 
I have agreement from the EEA to publish the GEMET environmental thesaurus in the SKOS/RDF format. 
The next step is to work out with them the URIs they wish to assign to their thesaurus and concepts. 
I'm not sure what to recommend to them on this matter. 
I thought to use an http:// based URI base (e.g. (e.g. http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET#204). 
A first question is, is it OK to use http: URIs for concepts? 
Sorry to drag this old chestnut up again, but I need some clear answer on best practices for this. 
Are we not at all concerned that the same URI may identify both a thesaurus concept and a resolveable network resource (i.e. the file containing the RDF data)? 
What do you think of info: based URIs for concepts? 
Hope to hear from you on this, Al. Alistair Miles Research Associate CCLRC - Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Building R1 Room 1.60 Fermi Avenue Chilton Didcot Oxfordshire OX11 0QX United Kingdom Hi Al, I like the approach that is outlined by the OASIS Published Subjects TC [1]. 
Although this document is a draft and omits some pieces that I would like to see, I feel that the general approach is a good one. 
To summarise, an HTTP identifier, when used to identify a concept *should* resolve to a human-readable resource that describes the concept. 
Despite coming from the topic maps community, I feel that this approach is applicable to the creation of any identifier scheme that uses HTTP for namespacing. 
The things that I would like to see the TC consider is recommendations for either embedding, linking to (e.g. using RDDL) or providing as parallel resource (via content negotiation), other machine-readable descriptions of the concept and related resource - so an RDF resource would be one example, the same information translated into XTM might be another and so on. 
It would be good to get the Published Subjects work kick started again (the committee went quiet a long time ago) - perhaps we could work on putting together a technical report to pass either to the OASIS TC or just to publish as part of the SWAD work ? 
Cheers, Kal [1] Kal Ahmed kal@techquila.com techquila Dan Brickley's Wordnet vocabulary service[1] at xmlns.com seems like a useful model. 
Essentially, each concept is given a (non-fragmentary) URI which, if dereferenced, returns a description of the concept. 
Mr Brickley's system only returns RDF/XML presently, but there's no reason it couldn't also return HTML or something else via content negotiation. 
[1] http://xmlns.com/2001/08/wordnet/ 
That works, but my preference would be for something like http://eionet.eu.int/GEMET/204 . 
In practice, using a fragment ID means that an HTTP request to a term's URI will return nothing or else a description of the entire vocabulary, which I'm guessing is pretty large. 
It would be confusing for a URI to identify a thesaurus concept and an RDF file. 
The key, as I see it, is the idea that the response to an HTTP Get is a representation of the resource, not the resource itself. 
The fact that http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog 
returns an RDF/XML document, doesn't mean that it identifies that particular document. 
If, for some reason, you wanted to talk about that RDF/XML document instead of the word "Dog", you would need to use a blank node or a different URI. 
Not everyone agrees with this position. 
less useful because it can't be dereferenced.

I think that this practice would certainly work much better with PSI/PSID constructs than the fragmentary approach - one resource per concept is probably a best practice that the Published Subjects TC should recommend. 
It is certainly true that content negotiation gives you the problem of talking about the descriptive resource as opposed to the described thing. 
That is a strong argument against content negotiation for RDF / XTM resources. 
However, there are still two other options: 1) Embed the RDF / TM markup in its XML form. 
Then use an rdf:ID attribute or XTM id attribute so that the reference to the RDF/XTM would be http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog#foo 
2) Use a profile of XLink to link to the RDF / TM resource that describes the concept, and make it completely separate. 
e.g. 
I don't think that a position can ever be established which everyone will agree with :-) I tend to agree. 
I tend to consider the use of URIs for subject identification as being divided into three categories: 1) The URI resolves to the subject being described 2) The URI resolves to a description of the subject being described 3) The URI is used as a pure, unresolvable identifier I think (2) gives the greatest possibility for interchange of semantics if the resource addressed by the URI is human-readable - at some point the processing of semantics has to be transferred from SW machinery to wet-ware. 
Cheers, Kal Kal Ahmed kal@techquila.com techquila This discussion is coming up from time to time. 
Its also called "Identity crisis" or "Uri crisis" Some interesting articles are: -rfc2396 (uri) - http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm - http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/deviant.html - http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI 
My opinion is to use Http URIs because: - they are unique - you can optionally put some content at the place the uri identifies (be it RDF or HTML) another guy behind this approach is Patrick Stickler and his URIQA. 
A good concept to think about when using Uris to identify more than one thing is to "Seperate by Ontology" You can use a single resource uri and annotate it with different triples, when you want to describe the "Web resource" aspect of the uri, use a web ontology, when you want to describethe "dog-concept" aspect, use the dog/concept ontology. 
They won't mix up, namespaces do the seperation. 
And a single resource can have more than one type. 
voila. 
Ad1: Don't use HASH identifiers if you can avoid them! 
may come to your web server as: -- whoops.

Betreff: Re: URIs for Concepts: Best Practices the EEA to publish the GEMET environmental thesaurus in format. 
The next step is to work out with them the URIs to assign to their thesaurus and concepts. 
I'm not sure what to recommend to them on this matter. 
URI which, if dereferenced, returns a description of the number of each concept (e.g. http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET#204). 
a description of the entire vocabulary, which I'm guessing to drag this old chestnut up again, but I need some clear best practices for this. 
Are we not at all concerned URI may identify both a thesaurus concept and a resource (i.e. the file containing the RDF data)? 
RDF/XTM would be  http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog#foo 
I don't think that a position can ever be established which everyone will agree with :-) I tend to agree. 
I tend to consider the use of URIs for subject identification as being divided into three categories: 1) The URI resolves to the subject being described 2) The URI resolves to a description of the subject being described 3) The URI is used as a pure, unresolvable identifier I think (2) gives the greatest possibility for interchange of semantics if the resource addressed by the URI is human-readable - at some point the processing of semantics has to be transferred from SW machinery to wet-ware. 
Cheers, Kal Kal Ahmed kal@techquila.com techquila That's the REST point of view and it's reiterated in the recent TAG publication. 
Yes; there's no generally applicable vocab currently (as far as I'm aware) in RDF to describe the relationship between a URI (as a web address rather than a resource identifier, so probably in the format of a datatyped literal) and stuff you get when dereferencing that URI, including specific content-negotiated HTTP conversations. 
But there's no reason why there shouldn't be, and it'd let you explicitly avoid confusions like "Ora Lassila's size in bytes". 
Including, I'm led to believe, some members of TAG. jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol. 
http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ "Sufficiently large"="infinite" for sufficiently large values of "sufficiently" I've always felt content negotiation was more of an opportunity than a problem. 
:-) If I'm reading you right, in the case of http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog 
, the "described thing" is the class "Dog", and the "descriptive resource" is the RDF/XML document returned if you do an HTTP Get. 
The REST view, as I understand it, is that the URI denotes the class "Dog". 
Since you can't actually transmit a class over the internet, any attempt to GET that URI will result in (1) a 404 or similar error, or (2) a representation of the class "Dog", which could be one of many possible electronic documents which is selected according to negotiation. 
All of these representations are themselves distinct resources, even if they have no explicit URI (that is, they are blank nodes). 
Some versions of HTTP include a Content-Location header, which gives a URI for the particular representation being returned. 
In that case, I would actually recommend content negotiation for RDF terms. 
If I put http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog 
into my web browser, I'd rather get a human-readable HTML document than a bunch of RDF. 
If my RDF software GETs the same URI, it should get an RDF document. 
In both of those cases, the goal is to find information about the class "Dog". 
We don't care as much (or at all) about the representation which conveys that information. 
I think we'd all agree to that.

I would prefer to say that the described thing is the abstract concept of Dog (Dog-ness ?) because the word "class" can be misinterpreted as meaning the OWL class Dog, for example. 
But I think you understood me correctly. 
In principal I agree with you that this would be a good way to go, and it fits nicely with a RESTful view of the world and I think it fits well with the distinction between resource and representation. 
However, I struggle with how to annotate the RDF/XML resource - how do I say that the author of this resource was John Smith ? 
In this case I am not interested in finding out more about Dog-ness, but I want to know more about this RDF description of Dog-ness - perhaps to establish whether or not I trust the source of information. 
While writing this, a lightbulb went on and I think I now understand something I had missed in your previous posting. 
In a prior email on this thread, you suggested that a way to refer to a representation could be: [ a Representation ; source http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog 
; date "2004-04-23T01:28:00Z" So I suggest that we might extend this model to include the content-negotiation parameters and then we can attach representation metadata to the blank node. 
I need more coffee before I can write out the RDF/XML syntax for this, but hopefully you can see what I'm getting at enough to tell me if we are on the same page or if I misunderstood. 
Cheers, Kal As I don't have all the RDF/OWL etc. syntax rules at my fingertips I can't comment on that part of the discussion, but I'd just like to slip in a mention of a long-standing issue, clarification of which might help understanding. 
When we are talking about a class or category of entities, such as "dogs", it is logical and clearer to use the plural form. 
Any definition or link is not to a specific dog, but to the attributes shared by all members of the class. 
A class may have sub-classes such as "spaniels" or "poodles", or specific instances such as "Fido", "Rover" or "Laika". 
It is important to be clear whether any URI is pointing to a category or to a specific instance. 
The convention of using the plural only applies to "count-nouns", to which the question "how many" is applicable. 
"Non-count-nouns", to which "how much" applies, like "water" or "love", are naturally expressed in the singular form.

"dog-ness"...] I'm reminded of a piece by Quine [1] - his base example is "rabbit", and he comes up with terms like "rabbithood" and "rabbiteth" to illustrate the linguistic challenges of determining what is indicated.
