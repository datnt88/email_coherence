<s> This issue is ... Some members of the XML Schema WG have expressed concern that XML Schema's rules for whitespace handling may interfere with expected behavior in other contexts.  </s>
<s> This may be the appropriate place to bring this question up.  </s>
<s> etc see part 1.2 My understanding is that RDF datatyping does *not* use XML Schema rules for whitespace processing (since they are not part of the lexical2value mapping as expressed in XSD).  </s>
<s> examples: Descibes a resource with two properties eg:p2 has an integer value (1), whereas eg:p1 does not have but is an ill-formed typed literal.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the whitespace handling of RDF is often misunderstood, e.g. today I was passed an example by a co-author which incorrectly expected whitespace trimming of values.  </s>
<s> I think we could go in either of two directions: A: accept the comment "worried that it may not be  </s>
<s> obvious that the whitespace processing is not part of the process of  </s>
<s> checking lexical forms for type validity," and add test cases to  </s>
<s> demonstrate that whitespace is significant even inside typed literals of  </s>
<s> types which in a XML Schema context would get processed away (such as the  </s>
<s> integer examples)  </s>
<s> B: accept the comment, amd moreover we think it will be less confusing to follow the XML Schema whitespace facet and the RDF L2V mapping is the mapping of: 1) apply the relevant whitepsace processing rules according to the whitespace facet 2) apply the XSD L2V mapping with corresponding changes to the lexical space.  </s>
<s> This would change the eg:p1 eg:p2 example (above) so that both properties had the same value.  </s>

<s> IMO, it's really for the XML Schema folks to say whether " 3 " is or is not an acceptable lexical representation when interpreted in terms of the datatype xsd:int.  </s>

<s> We might not be ready to close this one.  </s>
<s> The XML Schema rec is clear (sort of like the RDF working drafts :) that whitespace normalization is performed in part 1, but precisely which processing is specified in part 2. i.e. the processing chain is: input-text = entity substitution = whitespace normalization = [[Lexical Form]] = lexical-to-value mapping = value If you look at for example, the defn of lexical space does not include the leading and trailing blanks.  </s>
