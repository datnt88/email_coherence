<s> In my constant endeavour to provide my customers web services and interfaces that are easy for all to access and use - your site has got to be the worst.  </s>
<s> Navigation is terrible, there is so much jargon and gobbledegook it is almost impossible to understand, clarity - there is none, there are broken links, dead ends, no home page buttons, slow to download to mention a few of the horrors.  </s>
<s> What is level two (AA)?  </s>
<s> I have to comply with it and I have no idea how to after 1/2 an hour of searching - a summary would be helpful, simple answers would be wonderful.  </s>
<s> Where did the three click rule go?  </s>
<s> We are talking about making websites accessible and easy to use by all - not explaining the meaning of life.  </s>
<s> I would be delighted if someone would call me to help me out - on the other hand I would not be surprised if I did not hear a peep from you.  </s>
