<s> Toss a rule like this into your user style sheet, on modern browser with good CSS2 support:  </s>
<s> a[target="_new"]:after { content: "(This will open in a new window.)";  </s>
<s> }  </s>
<s> Ta da! Problem solved.  </s>
<s> Now all links that will create new windows are identified for you.  </s>
<s> No content generation support?  </s>
<s> Time to get a browser that supports  </s>
<s> Web standards better.  </s>
<s> :) Okay, just kidding on that, but really, this should be a solved problem by now.  </s>
<s> CSS2 gives us the ability to warn ourselves, and a warning from the author isn't necessary.  </s>

<s> No, but the point Kynn made is that you can do this in your user style sheet and apply it to your browser.  </s>
<s> If people had CSS2 capable browsers as a matter of course (after all, it is only about 5 years since the specification was published as a W3C Recommendation) then we could provide this user style sheet rule and not worry any more about whether the author put it in content.  </s>
<s> Where people are relying on pictures, and getting confused by new windows opening, a different approach is probably smarter - I would suggest the feature that many browsers have of forcing pages to open in the existing window, and keeping the history.  </s>
<s> (iCab does a slightly different thing - you can normally go back in the new window to the page from which you opened it, but not before.  </s>
<s> Opera gives you a more powerful history again as I recall).  </s>
