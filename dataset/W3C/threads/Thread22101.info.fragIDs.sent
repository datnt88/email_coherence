<s> FYI, Peter found a few bugs with the DOM Level 1 tests/framework: If someone can have a look at them, that would be nice, Philippe  </s>
<s> I've closed all three bugs as fixed.  </s>
<s> One was a stray attribute in the build.xml  </s>
<s> file, another was an description that was not consistent with the body of the the test.  </s>
<s> The third bug, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=261, involved hc_nodeinsertbefore.xml which was a transliteration of the XML-specific test nodeinsertnode.xml.  </s>
<s> The setup of the test depended on the preservation of the whitespace between the p and em elements in the following fragment: XML processors and Mozilla's HTML implementation would preserve the whitespace node, Konqueror and IE would eliminate the whitespace node.  </s>
<s> I've changed the test so it not affected by elimination of the whitespace node.  </s>
<s> If eliminating the whitespace node should be considered non-conformant,  </s>
<s> then a distinct test should be written to check for the behavior.  </s>
<s> However, it would appear to be a reasonable application-specific optimization of the content.  </s>
<s> Philippe I've committed the changes to the characterdata tests that didn't match their test descriptions described in Bug #343.  </s>
<s> Tests modified: characterdataindexsizeerrdeletedatacountnegative.xml characterdataindexsizeerrinsertdataoffsetgreater.xml characterdataindexsizeerrinsertdataoffsetnegative.xml characterdataindexsizeerrreplacedatacountnegative.xml characterdataindexsizeerrreplacedataoffsetgreater.xml  </s>
<s> Any problems or questions please let me know.  </s>

<s> HTML does handle whitespaces differently though.  </s>
<s> Konqueror and IE might use their HTML parser to load the XHTML.  </s>
<s> It might be a media type issue actually: if the XHTML document is parsed as "application/xhtml+xml" then the implementation must follow the rules of XML.  </s>
<s> If the document is parsed as "text/html", then HTML must followed.  </s>
<s> If the document is loaded from the disk, it does not have a media type, so Mozilla, Konqueror and IE are not wrong.  </s>
