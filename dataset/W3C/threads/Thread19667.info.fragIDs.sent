<s> I just installed Amaya and set up my server to authorise the PUT command for authoring.  </s>
<s> It works great except one thing but I see no real solution to that.  </s>
<s> My server is configured to handle all .html  </s>
<s> files as .shtml for Server Side Includes.  </s>
<s> When I take a page to edit it and then I put it again through the PUT method, the server side is lost.  </s>
<s> At the same place, the text corresponding to the include directive is present.  </s>
<s> I perfectly understand why this text is present but is there a way to change this ?  </s>
<s> I see nothing in the various documentation I read.  </s>
<s> I can't imagine that I am the only guy trying to do this.  </s>
<s> I absolutely want the include directive to be present and not the text.  </s>
<s> Any hint or tip will be welcome  </s>
<s> So, thanks in advance for your help.  </s>

<s> It seems to me that what you are trying to emulate with server side includes is really a transclusion, and should really be done on the client side.  </s>

<s> If I had fully understand the document, the TEXT tag is exactly what I want.  </s>
<s> I wish to add a common footer to all my pages but I don't want this text written on all pages.  </s>
<s> For the moment, the only way I found is the SSI mechanism.  </s>
<s> The text tag is not implemented I think.  </s>
<s> If yes, I did not succeed in making it work.  </s>
<s> Is this tag working for someone or should I wait for this tag to become a standard ?  </s>
<s> Is there another way to allow this kind of edition?  </s>
<s> Amicalement, Jean-Michel  </s>

<s> There is an embryonic answer to your problem within Amaya.  </s>
<s> You can use typed links ( a href="xxx" rel=Chapter" ) to note inclusions.  </s>
<s> The function "Makebook" in the special menu allows you to replace the typed link and the text around by the target content.  </s>
<s> You can experiement this functionality with the Amaya manual.  </s>
<s> But today, Amaya doesn't register the original context and if you save the document after "Makebook" the document will be saved with the content instead of the typed link.  </s>
<s> I think it would not too difficult to complete the "Makebook" function to do what you want.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> The text tag is currently only a proposal, though we will be implementing various kludges to make it work (initially at Keio University) and making them publically available with the hope that the W3C will eventually endorse it and browser authors will implement it.  </s>
<s> We are also working on other methods including one using the IMG tag.  </s>
