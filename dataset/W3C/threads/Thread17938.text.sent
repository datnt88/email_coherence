Hello, I urge all of you to familiarize yourselves with the proposals listed in the agenda so that we can make good progress at the meeting this week. 
I feel we have begun to stall and we need to maintain momentum to get through the rest of the minimal conformance requirements. 
Thank you, - Ian Contents of this message: 1) Information about the teleconference 2) Agenda (7 items on the agenda) 3) Open action items, completed action items.

5) GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and see whether they can be clarified to account for control of rendering of audio (and possibly other content) on load.

Since I have not done it, and it is not getting clearer, I am going to drop it for lack of time.

I'm ok with that.
