(Roland W. Sykes Mobile DIMENET Host) DIMENET Carries the dev-access discussion as dnet.dev-access within DIMENET.

We would all be very glad to help you advocate for an accessible world. 
Including the Virtual Space. 
Al, here.. Jeff, since you "shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth," let me ask: Roland, did you get permission from Jeff to create this archive? 
List subscribers, if you are interested in how our laundry looks or sounds in public, please take a minute to compare/contrast the above installation with the prototype at One difference that may not be obvious has to do with the follow-up links in the prototype at my site. 
This is part of a campaign I am on to get the work processes of the Web Access Initiative modified to make them more welcoming to internet users who move in the slow lane. 
With extended mailto: URLs such as I show in the prototype, and Lynx or Netscape as your browser, or any others that have implemented the Internet Draft redefining the mailto: URL syntax, you can be a full participant in the group discussion without subjecting yourself to a firehose of list email in your inbox. 
In the past this has mattered. 
The lynx-learners list exists because lynx-dev is too much of a firehose for the lynx-learners subscribers. 
Lynx-dev is a good model for what the working medium of the Initiative will be like if we don't do something to get some accomodations in the process model for the Initiative. 
We should be applying the lessons learned in the Lynx community to create a more accessible process infrastructure for the Initiative. 
Al Gilman First, yes, they did receive permission from Jamal, the co-sponsor of this list. 
Their response stating so got bounced, so I'm passing that answer along for them. 
I liked most of the mailto: features on your prototype and want to encourage as many subscribers to take a look for themselves as are even vaguely curious about an archive of this list. 
I will provide further feedback off-line. 
I also liked the search feature available at Roland's site. 
Check them both out. 
BTW, this link seems broken by now. 
OK, I liked the mailto extension proposal too (http://www.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-mailto-url-01.txt) but I think authors using these extensions should be made aware of the incompatibility with browsers that do not support them. 
In other word a mailto:dd@w3.org?subject:foo will either produce an error on the browser side or later bounce if my browser doesn't parse the ?header 
part correctly. 
As a rule of thumb, it is a good idea to always provide a separate "simple* mailto URL as well (much like before the time mailto itself was supported widely, people were asked to provide FORM alternative of mailto URL) From: Daniel Dardailler danield@w3.org

As a rule of thumb, it is a good idea to always provide a separate "simple* mailto URL as well (much like before the time mailto itself was supported widely, people were asked to provide FORM alternative of mailto URL) Both these suggestions are improvements, friendly amendments. 
The error modes you suggest are possible but not guaranteed. 
Extension-unaware browsers may have been programmed well and ignore the parts of the URL that they do not comprehend. 
And they should offer the user the opportunity to confirm/deny the headers picked up out of the mailto: which could reduce bounces. 
But after all that is said, it is still a good idea to offer the basic alternative.
