In looking at the topic of AT it occurs to me that we might have different levels of AT and ability to use technology Perhaps we have three levels 1 - the ability to Access using any existing tools 2 - the ability to Access using standard browsers and moderately priced AT. (less than $300 ??) 3 - the ability to Access using browsers and AT in their default settings.

Just catching up on my email! 
I think it is very important that we consider people's financial ability as well as any dis-abilities. 
This is why I test on different OS/browsers even though this isn't explicit in the guidelines. 
This is also why I have some reservations on the first set of conformance points (OTACS), because I think it requires people to have certain technologies and leads us down the garden path of "this site works best on IE 5.0" And before I initiate a flame war I would like to say that I have been sick and haven't managed to read all the emails so if this issue has been dealt with I apologise. 
See you tomorrow at OzeWAI.

I am not sure that using tools is a defining characteristic. 
But I think that if we are looking for a price barrier we should set it at zero. 
There are a lot of open-source solutions available, which rival commercial offerings. 
What money is worth is extremely varied - in the US $300 may only buy an hour or two of someone's time, but a person with the same knowledge and support will be available for less than $300 a month in another country. 
I agree that there is an issue of what is available in a default configuration.
