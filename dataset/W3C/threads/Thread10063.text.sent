[[Issue 1 - aboutEachPrefix I am told by Jeremy Carroll that this problem can be dealt with by Jena and modelled using OWL. 
The issue is why this is not something that a "basic" RDF processor should be able to deal with. 
In the aboutEachprefix case it was (theoretically) available in basic processors which did not implement other "optional" specifications.

So it is a layering question, asking why is this not (no longer) in RDF. 
I think we had good feedback that it lived badly in RDF and as such was hardly implemented. 
It broke layering by looking inside URIs rather than dealing with identity, felt mor elik a RDF/XML syntax thing than part of the RDF model and as such it mixed badly with the triples model (and bagID - ha ha). 
I also quite like what Dan Brickley said during the RDF Core WG discussion: [[I for one will never enourage people to write down useful generalisations in aboutEach syntax, because I don't want to have them come back and ask me why those rules aren't accessible via the (graph-oriented) APIs, query languages, database interfaces etc that they'll have to use to access their content. 
In my experience of talking to RDF developers _and_ content producers, there's often misunderstanding about which features of the XML syntax are carried through to the abstract graph. 
So my problem with encouraging the use of aboutEach is that it risks creating a huge legacy problem: information loss as we go from the RDF/XML into databases, APIs etc. 
Because about aboutEach mechanism _appears_ to be RDF's way of making generalised claims about members of a collection, people will likely use it as such unless we attach a health warning. 
Once it becomes clear that aboutEach is just a wierd macro mechanism, I believe it'll lose its appeal to content producers.]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0532.html 
This comment isn't a proposal to change anything, just a question. 
How do you deal with such things? 
It doesn't fit into accept/reject/postpone. 
Picking one: reject, the reasons it was thrown out of RDF remain valid. 
Brian: please add this to the agenda for Friday Dave Chas expresses the issue two ways: [[The first is the lack of a standardised "abouteachprefix" in RDF.]] and [[The issue is why this is not something that a "basic" RDF processor should be able to deal with.]] 
Processwise, I suggest we clarify this issue (as you have done) as: request that aboutEachPrefix be reinstated. 
Sure; please can we have proposed resolution text to consider. 
Brian Brian McBride said: I propose that the WG reject chas-01 "request to add aboutEachPrefix" on the grounds that the original reasons for removal remain valid: * We had good feedback that it lived badly in RDF and as such was little implemented or used. 
* It broke layering by looking inside URIs rather than dealing with them as identifiers. 
* Felt more like a RDF/XML syntax thing than part of the RDF model and as such it mixed badly with triples. 
* Worked badly with rdf:bagID - the interactions were never well understood. 
* Experienced practitioners recommended against using it.
