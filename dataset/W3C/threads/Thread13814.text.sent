There is a new version of the GL guidelines up You can get to both the Table and linear versions at for convenience the table version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19980825.html and the linear version is There is a techniques document under preparation which is attached to the both of the guidelines. 
The GUIDELINES (which has the major techniques listed in it) is close to being ready to send out. 
SO PLEASE look it over carefully and give us any feedback. 
This document needs to be cleared by GL and we are trying to do it in the next 7 days. 
It will then be sent to IG for review --- After covering comments from both GL and IG and making any adjustments it will be headed for a public release. 
We want this one to be a good one? 
and one that can lead us to a recommendation in the near future. 
So once again, please take the time to look it over carefully. 
THE TECHNIQUES document (which gives more detail on the techniques along with examples, is not done. 
But we have posted it for your comments and input. 
We would like input both on content and organization. 
(NOTE all of the links from the Guidelines doc to the Techniques Doc will take you to the top of the Techniques doc. 
Later we will link them in to the specific place they belong. 
Thanks much The editors and chairs.

I like the new version, especially in the table form :-). 
One thing that bothers me still is that HTML does not use alt-text long-desc and maybe also the other attributes consistently. 
It would be so easy to say that with every object with an image or a video or animation use alt-text for purpose X and long-desc for purpose Y. Now we need to have separate techniques for OBJECTS that are not explained in guideline 2 techniques and with FRAME we need to explain that you have to use a HTML file just because src attribute does not take alt-text (guideline 5). 
And a FRAME does take a long-desc attribute. 
I think it is important to try to make these more consistent. 
Now these are harder to explain and there is more chance that different authoring tools interprete the attributes differently. 
If we later have other similar attributes things just become more and more complicated. 
As there are probably some things we cannot change right now, should we have an additional column in the table that explains how be wish these things would be done in the future versions of HTML? 
Marja Guideline A.7 - What are the presentation elements? 
We need a link to a definition. 
- I didn't quite understand the rationale behind banning image maps in the techniques column item 3. Especially as in some other places, we just ask to provide alternative text for links in the image maps (A.12). 
Isn't a set of buttons also a structure? 
If just separate buttons are used, how then tell that they belong together? 
What is actually meant by buttons? 
Marja In the new techniques document, all of the structural elements and the presentation elements are separated into two lists. 
We can link to this definition from the guidelines document. 
good point. 
This seems to fit better in A.1 where we discuss image maps. 
Particularly with A.1.5 For all graphical buttons (INPUT type="image") provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute) Yes, it seems a set of buttons creates a "what to do next" structure, i.e., here are the possibilities of what you can do once you've filled out a form. 
The separate buttons would hopefully be identified by both a group label and individual labels that would make their purpose and grouping clear. 
"Buttons" refers to or --wendy Thank you, Marja-Riita! 
I want to re-affirm some of the things that you have said. 
It is hard for authors to follow the thread of what they need to do when the text backup for an image goes in different syntactic locations for images that arise in different places in the syntax. 
For the future we want to better capture the essence of the requirement into the formalism that defines web documents so that the casewise variation between different HTML elements (and yet more XML elements) is hidden from the people who have the natural language understanding to supply appropriate text. 
In the WAI-CG we are discussing with the rest of the W3C management how to build sensitivity to access drivers into the future Web Document development process. 
One approach that I can see for doing this is to define abstract relationships (image to ALT-equivalent, image to LONGDESC-equivalent) and have some form of binding of this abstract semantic relationships to multiple 'concrete' relationships as defined in the syntax of diverse DTDs. 
One open question is whether architectural forms are the right formalism for capturing abstract relationships and binding them to XML or SGML DTDs. 
Another idea is that RDF assertions may suffice. 
It is going to take more work to figure this out. 
We are trying to make this this work as integral to the W3C development of future formats as possible. 
But do keep our feet to the flames. 
Thank you for the good summary.
