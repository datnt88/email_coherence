A key point that I've found on Open Source - you place the license on REDISTRIBUTION, not use. 
Remember that, under standard Copyright, the user has the right to use the software, but not redistribute new or modified copies. 
The Open Source licenses are what enable that. 
Thus, by only specifying redistribution, you can mimic the GPL, and say, in effect "You don't have to agree with this license, but nothing else gives you the rights included. 
Use of these rights indicates acceptance of this license." 
I've noted this distinction between an acceptance of a license (unilateral?) and contract (bilateral?) before [1]; it's an interesting (and perhaps) important distinction that I don't completely understand yet. 
However, based on this thread I went and had a look and most of the OSI license *do* restrict use: Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work etc. [1] http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html 5. 
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

Although I would argue they don't need the "use" word in there, all of the ones you quote actually grant unlimited use (as in running the program). 
Except the GPL, which explicitly does not cover use (because copyright covers it). 
jeff Joseph Reagle scripsit: Contracts are bilateral in the sense that they are founded on an offer and an acceptance. 
Open source licenses generally tell you that you may do certain things (otherwise forbidden by statute) on certain conditions. 
If you don't do the things, the license doesn't accept you. 
These licenses allow, rather than restricting, use. 
IMHO (IANAL) allowing use is mere excess, having no effect.

--sign in Paris hotel | --Miles Vorkosigan To state my (no doubt flawed) understanding then: In ProCD v. Zeidenberg [1] the court found that while Zeidenberg was *not* restricted by copyright law from posting the factual information from the CD on the Web, he had entered into an orthogonal contract when he obtained that information that restricted his use of this material to that end. 
So he had volunteered (given the upholding of the legitimacy of shrinkwrap) something he had (the ability to post factual information) via contract in order to access it in the first place: But whether a particular license is gen- erous or restrictive, a simple two-party contract is not "equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the gen- eral scope of copyright" and therefore may be enforced. 
[1] (There's a number of cases that differ with respect to where on the page, or how prominent the notice of contract is [2], including Specht v. Netscape, but they don't seem to mitigate the trend of "shrinwrap" authority.) 
With the GPL, I have no right to make a copy regardless, and the license grants me that right given certain terms and conditions. 
So it's the inverse of the shrinkwrap scenario in that I am a "complete stranger" to the FSF (or whomever) and there is no actual contract...? [1] http://www.law.emory.edu/7circuit/june96/96-1139.html [2] http://www.phillipsnizer.com/int-click.htm 
BTW: Interesting reading: Whether there are legal differences between "contracts" and "licenses" (which may matter under the copyright doctrine of first sale) is a subject for another day. 
See Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 
208 (E.D. N.Y. 1994). 
Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 
208 (E.D. N.Y. 1994). 
Defendants argue, however, that because the Products they sold were purchased from Microsoft licensees, they are immune from liability for copyright infringement under the first sale doctrine. 
In response, plaintiff argues that the first sale doctrine does not apply to the present case because Microsoft never sells but rather only licenses its Products. 
To the extent that defendants bought their ?[**15]? 
Microsoft Products from authorized Microsoft licensees, they were subject to the same licensing restrictions under which those licensees operated. 
Finally, plaintiff's claim that defendants exceeded the scope of its license ?[**19]? agreements states a claim for copyright infringement rather than breach of contract. 
Not being parties to any license agreement with Microsoft, defendants are "complete strangers" to Microsoft, and their violations of the licensing restrictions must of necessity be seen as claims arising under the copyright laws rather than the law of contracts. 
See Marshall v. New Kids on the Block Partnership, 780 F. Supp. 
1005, 1008 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). 
Even if defendants were seen as parties to Microsoft's license agreements, their undisputed distribution of Products outside the scope of the license agreements puts them in the same position as an infringer having no contractual relationship with the copyright holder and again makes them "strangers" to Microsoft. 
Id. at 1009; Kanakos v. MX Trading Corp., 1981 WL 1377, *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 1981). 
Accordingly, plaintiff's allegation that defendants exceeded the scope of the license agreement states a claim for copyright infringement. 
Be careful here. 
A license is a type of contractual arrangement. 
John's description of open source licensing is correct except for his last sentence about acceptance. 
For purposes of setting forth distinctions between open source licensing and other forms of software licenses, you are headed in the wrong direction by reference to acceptance. 
Ostensibly, a licensee must consent to the terms of the license in order to be bound - - as is true of any contract. 
How that consent manifests itself is a different question. 
John was also correct that the important factor distinguishing open source licenses from other software licenses has much more to do with the grant clause (i.e. users may copy, modify, distribute...). 
Sorry, Joseph, I am not convinced formalisms such as whether the license permits acceptance by unilateral performance or bilateral promise is anything more than a dead-end as far as open source is concerned.
