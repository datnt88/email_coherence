Greetings, Andy Quick was kind enough to provide me the latest version of the Java HTML Tidy. 
You can find the package at Please read the message on the page and let me know if you are interested in participating in maintenance of the Java port of HTML Tidy. 
Yours, -Sami lempinen@iki.fi 
http://www.iki.fi/lempinen/ apt-get a life Sami -- I would definitely be interested in taking a very active role in maintaining the Java port of HTML tidy. 
If you could provide the infrastructure, that would be great. 
I think we need to decide if we'd like JTidy to be a faithful reproduction of the official Tidy version, bugs and all, or if we'd like to repair bugs on our own, somehow coordinating with the official version. 
I vote for the faithful reproduction approach. 
BTW, you might want to include a link to your email address on your web page so that others who visit the web page but missed your email to this list could give you the requested feedback. 
Gary Greetings, No problem at all. 
Would you require CVS access (a la SourceForge) or is it enough if I act as a patch and release coordinator? 
I second this. 
Does anyone (Mr. Raggett?) know how the versions were synced in the past? 
Does the official release mechanism offer changelogs that are detailed enough, or do the Java maintainers perform diffs themselves? 
Good idea. 
It's there now.

http://www.iki.fi/lempinen/ apt-get a life Whatever is easiest for you is fine with me. 
If we decide go with the faithful reproduction approach, we should only need to release when the official Tidy releases which has been every few months and shouldn't need much interim updating. 
Not sure how things were done but I have no problem doing the diffs myself. 
Gary I'm "fooling" around with the source code for HTML tidy for my own pleasure/education. 
To ensure I don't break anything I use a regression test based on an html file and diffing the output from the original version with the output from the one I am fooling with. 
I just wondered if anyone had some "better" input html files that were chosen to really excercise the various features of the HTMLTidy, as these would provide a more thorough regression test. 
And if so, if I could have access to them. 
Thanks for any assistance. 
I do limited regression testing when porting Tidy to Mac OS. Most of my testing comes from real-world HTML that users send to me or the mailing list when they discover what they believe is a bug. 
I keep those files around, to make sure the bugs have been fixed, and haven't re-appeared (sometimes they have), but I don't exhaustively test things (as I have found out grin ). 
There is some pretty horrible real-world HTML out there grin . 
I too would be interested in regression suites - perhaps you could make your own available. 
Regards, Terry Could I be so bold as to ask you to send them to me :-) (as I have Yes, haven't we all. 
Mine is pretty simplistic ;-) to say the least, it goes something like this: tidy input.html  
original.html 
tidymod input.html  
output.html 
windiff output.html 
original.html 
with more files I would probably make two output folders, original and output and diff the contents of these instead. 
Not very sophisticated I admit but if I have a resonable collection of HTML files to feed it, it should be quite useful.
