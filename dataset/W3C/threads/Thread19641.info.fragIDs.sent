This is present in Amaya 1.0a, but has been present in earlier releases. 
If Amaya reads in the following HTML: It doesn't complain about the link, but it does complain that "&amp;y=" is an invalid entity in the img . 
Another interesting feature is that "&amp;ft;" is turned into a " " symbol, but I don't recognise that as a valid entity.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Greetings, 
AFAIK, Amaya is right in doing so. 
RFC 1866 says: NOTE - The URI from a query form submission can be used in a normal anchor style hyperlink. 
Unfortunately, the use of the `&amp;' character to separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML attribute values as an entity reference delimiter. 
For example, the URI `http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2' must be written ` a href="http://host/?x=1&amp;#38;y=2"' or ` a href="http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;y=2" 
'. HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI implementors are encouraged to support the use of `;' in place of `&amp;' to save users the trouble of escaping `&amp;' characters this way. 
I came across the same issue when I was working on my HTML validator (http://www.snowman.sci.fi/lehtori/ - it's not ROT13'd, it's in Finnish ;-) and received angry messages from people who were getting errors when referring to CGI scripts. 
That looks like an error to me. 
BTW - did my bug reports concerning the Save As dialog and Amaya losing the NOWRAP attribute ever make it to the list? 
I do not think I ever saw any replies.

Yes, Amaya complains because, according to RFC 1866, this is not correct (refer to a previous message by Sami Lempinen). 
Amaya complains, but it accepts "&amp;y=" and saves it as is. 
This is clearly a bug. 
It has been fixed. 
The next release will contain the fix. 
Tanks for the bug report.

The nowrap bug has been fixed. 
Version 1.0a does not lose the NOWRAP attribute. 
We are about to fix the Save As bug. 
Thanks for your patience.

I can live with it being incorrect, and that you should use "x=1&amp;amp;y=2" as the value for the "src" tag. 
In which case, my bug report is that if I read in a file containing: When this is saved, Amaya turns this into: On a related note, should Amaya take your location for inserted images, and take the "&amp;" as "&amp;amp;", or should it be the responsibility of the user to enter it correctly?
