To whom it may concern: I was told that the W3C has been considering changes to the new CSS2 spec that would incorporate aural stylesheets (audio rendering of HTML content). 
Can anyone point me in that direction? 
I think tags that would aid in presenting content audibly (as opposed to visually) would greatly improve access for people who are driving but need to access web content now, or people with Palm Pilots, or people with visual impairments. 
Hope to hear from you! 
Thanks.

CSS2 Recommendation has already incorporated aural style sheets. 
See: W3C is very much interested in the future of voice interaction for browsing the Web. 
We will hold a workshop on this issue to help catalyze the development of voice browsing for the Web.
