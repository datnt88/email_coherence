Thinking about it, I am tempted to suggest that as we use synchronous and asynchronous for communication, we should do the same for authoring but with the explanation that this means 'real-time' or 'live' authoring... 
I am assuming that the two cases we are talking about are "live production" - such as webcasting an event as it happens - and synchronous collaborative authoring, where two or more people are engaged in working on the same document interactively. 
In many cases this is the same thing we are already talking about, with a timing constraint of sorts. 
It is no good to go back afterwards and fix everything, but it is possible in both kinds of cases that one person is specifically responsible for a given type of content. 
For example, the people who provide voice commentary for TV coverage of an event are rarely the people who provide the real-time captioning, nor is their voice commentary used as radio commentary - since the needs of the audiences are different, there are different commentators. 
On often of radio commentary as well (and sometimes even of video with commentary!). 
In the case of synchronous collaborative work, it might be helpful to think of a meeting. 
Many of us in this group have been at meetings where there were people simultaneously providing sign language or text interpretation of voice, voice descriptions of images, etc. 
So I guess one of the things we need to look for is tools that support generating content in formats that can handle a variety of concurrent forms (things like SMIL and SVG spring to mind), and techniques that tools can apply to enable the joint or solo production of those forms concurrently. 
Lots of shortcuts for things people need, or use often.

yes In the WG meeting this am we were wondering what to call this kind of thing. 
Carlos said that 'real-time' authoring did not work very well for him. 
We tried synchronous, instantaneous, etc .. and it is still open, i think. 
I think that Charles' ideas here are going to be useful to explain what we are talking about, whatever word/s we choose. 
And we are in need of techniques, so this input is helpful. 
Liddy.........I like 'live', that is a instance/context specific word that works in my mind (from a US point of view).........so.......though they seem a mouthful.............. 
In general use: 'live' authoring Or Real-time/live authoring Or Live real-time authoring For Synchronous and Asynchronous specific use: Synchronous 'live' authoring or Synchronous Real-time/live authoring Or Live real-time synchronous authoring AND Asynchronous 'live' authoring or Asynchronous Real-time/live authoring Or Live real-time asynchronous authoring Katie Haritos-Shea Internet/Software/Device Accessibility and Standards Strategist/Developer/Evangelist #571-220-7777 "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.
