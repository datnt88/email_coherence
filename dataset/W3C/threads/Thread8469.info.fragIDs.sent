<s> The use of the dash is problematic for those who want to use the tag name as an indication that the char data of the given tag should be used in a mathematical expression of some kind.  </s>
<s> max-size could mean get the value binding for the element max-size or it could mean subtract the value bindings for the elements max and size.  </s>
