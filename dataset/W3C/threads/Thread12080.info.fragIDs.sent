<s> I think these icons are very nice, well done graphically, nice to look at.  </s>
<s> One little problem I see though: they're so similar in overall shape that you have to look at tiny details to see their difference (and semantics) - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an icon in the first place, I think.  </s>
<s> (Sorry Matthias!) I'm attaching my "programming" icon in two sizes.  </s>
<s> BMP format, but they can easily be converted to PNG or GIF.  </s>
<s> These were designed (together with a set of other icons) to be easily recognizable and discernable even at the small 16x16 icon size (as used in trees and "small icons" displays on Windows).  </s>

<s> I've tried to add some redundant cues to tell them apart.  </s>
<s> They are also small enough to not change the spacing.  </s>

<s> no problem - its just a sketch.  </s>
<s> My pen and the hand are pretty much redundant.  </s>
<s> In this sense your icon is much better.  </s>
<s> It focuses on the distinguishing aspects.  </s>
<s> I?ve also tried to eliminate the bright colors to make the icons less dominant.  </s>
<s> I?d like to stick with the shape.  </s>
<s> Because this conveys "application".  </s>
<s> A lot of constraints need to be evaluated if you design icons.  </s>
<s> I will give it another try.  </s>

<s> Hi everyone, Here's another shot at the checkpoints for Guideline 7. I have changed the wording for most of the checkpoints and their subtexts.  </s>
<s> Guideline 7. Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to authors with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: 7.1 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool follows all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and conventions.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1 for standards and conventions essential to accessibility; Priority 2 for those important to accessibility; Priority 3 for those beneficial to accessibility] The techniques for this checkpoint include references to platform-specific checklists and guidelines and to general guidelines for accessible applications.  </s>
<s> 7.2 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool enables authors to change the presentation of editing views without affecting the document markup.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint requires that the author be able to view the content they are authoring in a way that differs from the presumed appearance of the rendered content.  </s>
<s> At minimum, this means supporting the user's system-wide display preferences and providing alternate textual representations for non-text elements during editing.  </s>
<s> 7.3 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool enables authors to navigation via the document structure within editing views in an accesible fashion.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> At minimum, this means allowing the author to search or move focus between elements of the same type using UI mechanisms that comply with Checkpoint 7.1.  </s>
<s> More useful implementations, might allow greater flexibility to traverse the document tree.  </s>
<s> 7.4 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool enables the user to edit the document structure and all available properties of each element of the document in an accessible fashion.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> At minimum, this means ensuring that there is at least one means, that complies with Checkpoint 7.1, of editing or changing every property (that is available to be changed and edited by the tool).  </s>
<s> More useful implementations might ensure that all means for editing or changing propeties be accessible.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) University of Toronto jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
<s> I agree with the proposals for 7.2 and 7.3.  </s>
<s> I think we should still have the search functionality as a requirement.  </s>
<s> Although this is a common enough feature of text document and markup editors it is not as common in multimedia editors, and it is useful to provide techniques for it.  </s>
<s> Admittedly, it is a subset of navigation methods - as well as navigating by the structure it is useful to be able to navigate to points known or presumed to exist.  </s>
<s> This is not a P1 requirement, but it is still something that should be done at some level of conformance.  </s>
<s> My comments on Jan's proposals for 7.1 and 7.4 are below after each proposal - look for "CMN" chaals 7.1 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool follows all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and conventions.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1 for standards and conventions essential to accessibility; Priority 2 for those important to accessibility; Priority 3 for those beneficial to accessibility] The techniques for this checkpoint include references to platform-specific checklists and guidelines and to general guidelines for accessible applications.  </s>
<s> CMN Agree.  </s>
<s> I would add to the note "In many cases several sets of standards will be applicable".  </s>
<s> 7.4 Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool enables the user to edit the document structure and all available properties of each element of the document in an accessible fashion.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> At minimum, this means ensuring that there is at least one means, that complies with Checkpoint 7.1, of editing or changing every property (that is available to be changed and edited by the tool).  </s>
<s> More useful implementations might ensure that all means for editing or changing propeties be accessible.  </s>
<s> CMN disagree.  </s>
<s> This porposal seems to have lost the "edit the structure" requirement that it has absorbed in its minimum requirements.  </s>
<s> I would instead keep it as two checkpoints, the first having "edit propoerties" and the minimum requirement as expressed, and the second as follows: Ensure that the user interface enables the author to edit the structure of the document in an accessible fashion At minimum, allow the user to copy, cut or paste an element and its content at any level of the document tree hierarchy.  </s>
<s> More useful implementations may provide advanced features for modifying the stucture.  </s>

<s> I would like to suggest breaking 7.1 down into 3 guidelines.  </s>
<s> Reason being that earlier today I had to explain to a group of people what the ATAG meant by "Relative Priority" and this was the one guideline that they pointed out as not following the definition of "depending on the corresponding priority in the WCAG." Break down would look something like... 7.1.1  </s>
<s> Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool follows all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and conventions that are essential to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Priority 1 7.1.2  </s>
<s> Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool follows all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and conventions that are important to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Priority 2 7.1.3  </s>
<s> Ensure that the user interface of the authoring tool follows all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and conventions that are beneficial to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Priority 3 Hi everyone, Here's another shot at the checkpoints for Guideline 7. I have changed the wording for most of the checkpoints and their subtexts.  </s>
<s> Guideline 7. Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to authors with disabilities.  </s>

<s> Hello all, Here's my next stab at Guideline 7. I have tried to incorporate (as much as possible) all the comments from the calls and list.  </s>
<s> Here are the highlights: 1. Restored the searching checkpoint (7.6) 2. Restored the separate property and structure editing.  </s>
<s> 3. Introduced the term "Authoring interface" 4. Tried to make the three priority levels on 7.1 more clear 5. Tried to make the "at minimum" text more general (since the checkpoints range in generality, getting less general subtext that is still more general techniques is sometimes easier said than done) 6. Made quite a few changes to all of the subtext.  </s>
<s> 7. Borrowed the phrase "operating environment conventions that benefit accessibility" from UA. Guideline 7. Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to authors with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Note: the guideline explanatory text has not been changed and so is not included Checkpoints: 7.1 Ensure that the authoring interface follows all operating environment conventions that benefit accessibility.  </s>
<s> [Three priority levels: Priority 1 for standards and conventions essential to accessibility; Priority 2 for those important to accessibility; Priority 3 for those beneficial to accessibility] This checkpoint requires all aspects of the authoring interface to be accessible to the author.  </s>
<s> This wide scope means that the checkpoint applies to the implementation of all the other checkpoints in this guidelines document.  </s>
<s> The techniques for meeting this checkpoint include references to platform-specific checklists and guidelines and to general guidelines for accessible applications.  </s>
<s> In many cases several sets of standards will be applicable.  </s>
<s> 7.2 Ensure that the authoring interface enables accessible editing of all element and object properties.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint is a special case of checkpoint 7.1 that is especially important to authoring tools.  </s>
<s> At minimum, the checkpoint requires at least one accessible way to edit every element and object property supported by the tool.  </s>
<s> More advanced implementations might ensure that all of the ways in which the tool allows element and object properties to be edited should be accessible.  </s>
<s> 7.3 Ensure that the authoring interface enables the author to edit the structure of the document.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] This checkpoint is a special case of checkpoint 7.1 that is especially important to authoring tools.  </s>
<s> At minimum, the checkpoint requires that the author be able to copy, cut or paste an element and its content at any level of the document tree hierarchy.  </s>
<s> More advanced implementations might provide more powerful ways to edit elements or groups of elements in the structure.  </s>
<s> 7.4 Allow the display preferences of the authoring interface to be changed without affecting the document markup.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint requires that the author be able to view the content, as it is being authored, in a way that differs from the presumed default appearance of the rendered content.  </s>
<s> At minimum, the tool should support any system-wide display preferences as well as allowing textual alternatives to be displayed in place of non-text elements.  </s>
<s> More advance implementations might allow the author to select an editing style sheet that is different from the document style sheet.  </s>
<s> 7.5 Ensure that the authoring interface enables accessible navigation of editing views via the document structure.  </s>
<s> [Priority?2]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint requires that tools make use of the structure of the documents being edited, in order to simplify navigation for the author.  </s>
<s> At minimum, the author should be able to move from element to element.  </s>
<s> More advanced implementations might provide highly flexible mechanisms that take advantage of the hierarchical nature of the document tree.  </s>
<s> 7.6 Ensure the authoring interface allows the author to search within the editing views.  </s>
<s> [Priority?2]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint requires that tools provide a search facility.  </s>
<s> While this is a common feature in most text markup editing tools, it is less common for other authoring tools (i.e. SVG and editors).  </s>
<s> At minimum, the tool should allow basic text search.  </s>
<s> More advance implementations might have more powerful mechanisms that, for example, might search on the basis of structure or similarity.  </s>

<s> Hello all, The following is an updated version of checkpoint 7.4.  </s>
<s> The "at minimum" statement has been modified and a WSIWYG note has been added as per the conversation on Monday.  </s>
<s> 7.4 Allow the display preferences of the authoring tool user interface to be changed without affecting the document markup.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> This checkpoint applies primarily to WYSIWYG markup editing tools and requires that the author be able to view the content, as it is being authored, in a way that differs from the presumed default appearance of the rendered content.  </s>
<s> At minimum there must be some mechanism for changing the document display independently of the document markup.  </s>
<s> There are a number of ways that this can be achieved, including supporting operating environment display preferences and allowing the author to specify an editing style sheet that is different from those included with the end document.  </s>
<s> In addition, there must be some means by which textual alternatives can be displayed to the author in place of non-text elements.  </s>
