<s> Yes, the same thing happened to me just now with JTidy 4aug2000r4.  </s>
<s> Sami, can we rebuild this zip file (perhaps omitting all of the classes) and re-release?  </s>

<s> I'll try to make a release tonight once I'm back from docking my boat for the winter.  </s>
<s> I should be able to roll a package by tomorrow at the latest.  </s>

<s> Can those of you who had trouble unzipping r4 please verify that r5 works ok? BTW: r4 unzipped fine on my Debian box.  </s>
<s> This seems like a really weird problem in that it only affected some people.  </s>
<s> Release notes for r5 are at Comments welcome.  </s>
