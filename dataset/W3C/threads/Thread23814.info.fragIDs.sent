<s> Speaking as a designer, producer and user of type, I have some concerns about a technology such as TrueDoc.  </s>
<s> As I understand it (and no doubt someone will  </s>
<s> correct me if I'm wrong) TrueDoc converts each font into a new proprietary format which allows for easy compression and transmition.  </s>
<s> At the other end, the font is reconstituted and "autohinted" thus reestablishing some level of screen quality.  </s>
<s> While this scenario may produce satisfactory bitmaps in many cases, it will certainly fail for a significant portion of the fonts in the marketplace today.  </s>
<s> In particular, any TrueType font which has been extensively tuned to provide optimal screen bitmaps will be in jeopardy when TrueDoc is used to convert and compress it for use on the Web.  </s>
<s> How confident can a Web publisher be that the reader will see the same thing as he/she is designing on the Mac or PC which is on their desktop.  </s>
<s> Thomas Rickner Monotype Typography Inc Disclaimer- The thoughts expressed here are my own, and do not represent those of my employer.  </s>
<s> I also have some reservations.  </s>
<s> One problem is that the TrueDoc scheme is based on blowing up characters to a large size on the source platform, and then re-digitizing them.  </s>
<s> Many Japanese fonts come with some builtin limit for enlargement (means you have to pay extra if you want to use these fonts for characters in display sizes).  </s>
<s> With such fonts, it may happen that what TrueDoc wants to do is not possible, or only at restricted quality.  </s>
<s> Also, one has to be aware of the fact that while in the US, only the imple- mentation of a font (i.e. the font program) is copyright-protected, and thus TrueDoc fonts most probably can be passed around freely, many other countries have more strict (and more reasonable) copyright protection of fonts, protecting also the design.  </s>
<s> Therefore, if TrueDoc fonts are not strictly linked to the documents that they have been generated for (this may be the case; I don't know the details), this scheme may not be feasible worldwide.  </s>
<s> Well, apart from the problems of screen resolution, color lookup table congestion, white temperature of the display, and other details of illumination and such, there is a very failproof way already to be sure your reader sees the same as you do: Use bitmaps :-! Regards,Martin.  </s>
<s> TrueDoc is a font transport mechanism which preserves font fidelity.  </s>
<s> We have had several font designers try to distiguish between printed and screen output for Type 1, TrueType, and TrueDoc.  </s>
<s> They were correct about 1/3 of the time.  </s>
<s> Because of TrueDoc's high quality, multiplatform support, and professional SDK, TrueDoc won the Seybold 96 Technology Trailblazer award.  </s>
<s> Also, both FutureTense's Texture product, and Tumbleweed's Envoy Publishing Essentials were Seybold Hot Picks (both rely on TrueDoc).  </s>
<s> As for bitmaps - when they are moved from device to device with different resolutions, they just don't work.  </s>
