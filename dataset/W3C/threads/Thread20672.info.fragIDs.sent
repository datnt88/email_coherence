<s> I have compiled and installed amaya-4.3.2 on top of Solaris 2.7 with lesstif-0.92.26.  </s>
<s> Works fine, as usual.  </s>
<s> Between amaya-4.3 and this new version, we have now &amp;times; and &amp;divide; working, but &amp;oelig; and &amp;OElig; don't work any more (on printed paper).  </s>
<s> How can we make these 2 characters work again?  </s>
<s> If we respect the ISO-latin standard, these characters don't exist.  </s>
<s> To solve the problem we patched ISO-latin-1 fonts, but &amp;times; and &amp;divide; didn't work.  </s>
<s> The right solution is to use oe and OE or to wait for the support of Unicode.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> &amp;inodot; should be not working either.  </s>
<s> However, &amp;#144; can catch it.  </s>
<s> For those who still want &amp;oelig; and &amp;OElig; on paper, modify thotlib/editing/print.c: - replace all "ISOLatin1Encoding" by "ISOLatin1Encodinh" - replace two /.notdef in front of /dotlessi by /OE and /oe &amp;OElig; and &amp;oelig; get printed if you use &amp;#142; and &amp;#143; (it works on paper only)  </s>
