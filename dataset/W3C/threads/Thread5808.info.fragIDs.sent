<s> All, I have a possible additional use case for you: content negotiation.  </s>
<s> Some time ago, I did some work for an IETF specification using logical expressions to describe sets of features, in a fashion having similarities with Description Logics.  </s>
<s> In particular, the feature matching (i.e. matching content origination capabilities with receiver capabilities) was, I think, a form of subsumption calculation.  </s>
<s> See RFC 2533 [1] for more details.  </s>
<s> Now we have CC/PP using RDF to describe client capabilities, but without any framework for matching them with origination capabilities.  </s>
<s> E.g. the sort of missing capability one could imagine is a number of content generation stylesheets, each associated with a description of required media features, from which a selection could be made by matching with the client CC/PP profile.  </s>
<s> Preferably, this stylesheet would have a form very similar to the CC/PP profile.  </s>
<s> This could provide a basis for protocol- and application-independent content negotiation [2].  </s>
<s> A long-term goal of mine is to work to converge the CC/PP and IETF RFC2533 frameworks to the point that the semantics, if not the syntax, are readily exchangeable.  </s>
<s> Some work on converging vocabularies is underway.  </s>
<s> I had been looking to the DAML/OWL work to provide a basis for implementing feature matching of descriptions using logical expressions.  </s>
<s> There may be some difficulties with the RFC 2533 form, as it uses negation and disjunction, and keeps the computation tractable by limiting the expressions in other ways.  </s>
<s> (I don't fully grok the constraints on DL expressions that are used to ensure tractability.)  </s>
<s> I have one other comment on the requirements document, concerning procedural attachments.  </s>
<s> While I can understand that there will be new applications that will need some kind of extension to OWL to fulfill their requirements, I think it would be a great shame if the language cannot satisfy its original use-case goals without such extension (particularly given that string and arithmetic primitives are also noted in the objectives).  </s>
<s> Also, the term "procedural" makes me nervous.  </s>
<s> I strongly feel that such attachments, where used, should not be used to allow an OWL expression to have side-effects, as that would introduce all sorts of evaluation-scheduling constraints (e.g. would effectively prohibit caching of already-evaluated results).  </s>
<s> Related to this, I think that where external evaluations are used, the OWL processor should be able to know if they depend upon volatile conditions -- i.e. can the result be evaluated once and then cached for use as-needed?  </s>
<s> (Specifically, I would like to be able to perform OWL evaluations in the framework of a functional programming environment using lazy evaluation.) #g [1] ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2533.txt  </s>

<s> These comments may have already been fed into the process via Jeremy Carroll so apologies if these are just repetition ... 1.  </s>
<s> The multimedia-collections use case is not completely convincing.  </s>
<s> There are domains where purely symbolic descriptions are very appropriate but others, such as this, which also demand subsymbolic descriptions.  </s>
<s> Certainly symbolic metadata annotations can be, and are being, used for multimedia data, However, this domain raises issues about representation of uncertainty, about statistical rather than logical classifications and relations, about representation of non-rigid qualifiers (e.g. the "late" in the example) and so forth - none of which I see being addressed in the requirements sections.  </s>
<s> Personally I am comfortable that Webont should not address such issues but this use case is potentially misleading.  </s>
<s> 2. Can I suggest a requirement (or objective) that ontologies can be annotated with additional meta information at a fine grain.  </s>
<s> There is a requirement already for overall ontology annotation and a more specialized "procedural attachment" objective.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer a general mechanism, as is currently possible which DAML-in-RDF, which could be applied to more than just procedural attachment.  </s>
<s> For example, I can see uses for an application annotating a class with non-logical information such as display hints or inference hints which don't affect the semantics but affect the nature and performance of the application.  </s>
<s> If you do not build on top of RDF (where it comes for free) then a similarly open-ended method of annotation or extension would be useful.  </s>
<s> 3. It is implicit in the whole document but I didn't see an explicit goal/requirement/objective that OWL should be usable to describe the ontology of terms used in RDF fact bases.  </s>
<s> I take it that this is a given (that RDF is the "Abox" for OWL's "Tbox") but a more explicit statement of the relationship between RDF and OWL might be helpful.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Graham, Thank you for your comments.  </s>
<s> As for use cases, we did not try to provide an exhaustive set, we only wanted to find very distinct, representative use cases.  </s>
<s> The use case you mention is a good one, but unless it generates some new requirements, there is no real need to add it to the document.  </s>
<s> I want to clarify that the objectives section of the document lists things that some members of the group thought would be useful, but there was no consensus on.  </s>
<s> Sometimes this was because the objective was not well-defined, other times it was because it was considered too hard for the first version of the language.  </s>
<s> There was no effort to keep these objectives orthoganal, and thus some may overlap with each other (as you point out, procedural attachments could be used to perform arithmetic or string comparisons).  </s>
<s> Your concerns about procedural attachments are duly noted, and should be mentioned in the description of the objective.  </s>
<s> It is highly unlikely that this objective will be addressed in this version of the language, but if it is, we'll take your suggestions into consideration.  </s>
