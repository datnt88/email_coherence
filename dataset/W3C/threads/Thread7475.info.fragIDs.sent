<s> If you have not already made your arrangements for lodging for the WebDAV meeting here's some information I gathered that may be helpful.  </s>
<s> The listing of hotels in the Microsoft page seems accurate except that some hotels have changed their names.  </s>
<s> The hotel prices range from $99 to $225 a night.  </s>
<s> I personally prefer to stay at bed and breakfast inns.  </s>
<s> They are often more comfortable, less anonymous (which can be good or bad) usually have great breakfasts, and are often cheaper too.  </s>
<s> Here's the phones of six in the area.  </s>
<s> None are known to me.  </s>
<s> (Each B&amp;B is different, whereas hotels are consistent, but I have never been disappointed.)  </s>
<s> For what it's worth, I know the Cascade B&amp;B is sold out for the nights of June 15 and 16.  </s>
<s> I also know it's cheaper ($75/night) than the cheapest hotel I called (Best Western, at $99) and even cheaper when you consider it includes breakfast.  </s>
<s> I hope this information is useful but I provide it with no warrantee expressed or implied.  </s>
<s> it would be great if Microsoft could add it to their Web page.  </s>
