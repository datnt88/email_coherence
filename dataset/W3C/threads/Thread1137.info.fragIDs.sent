<s> I'm having trouble getting tidy to correct URL's with ampersand (&amp;) character.  </s>
<s> The page below contains one URL with part "...05B8&amp;displaylang=en". For some reason tidy doesn't want to convert the &amp; mark correctly.  </s>
<s> Could someone advice if the cause is my config below?  </s>
<s> Here's a link to the sample page: Here's my tidy configuration: char-encoding: latin1 doctype: strict tidy-mark: no clean: yes drop-font-tags: yes logical-emphasis: yes output-xml: yes output-xhtml: yes numeric-entities: yes show-warnings: no show-body-only: yes hide-comments: yes drop-proprietary-attributes: yes word-2000: yes quote-marks: yes quote-ampersand: yes force-output: yes Thanks, Tommi  </s>
<s> Works for me.  </s>
<s> What behavior did you expect?  </s>
<s> What did Tidy instead?  </s>
<s> Which version (`tidy -v`)?  </s>
<s> I have a .NET  </s>
<s> wrapper that is using the tidylib.dll  </s>
<s> from tidy-040318-dll-fast.zip.  </s>
<s> Could it be that the win32 dll doesn't working properly correctly?  </s>
<s> The wrapper I'm using does LoadConfig and then tidyCleanAndRepair.  </s>

<s> You haven't answered the first two questions.  </s>
<s> I doubt that.  </s>
<s> Could you try the command line application instead?  </s>
<s> You can find it from http://htmltrim.sourceforge.net/tidy.html .  </s>
<s> Solved it.. a bit silly :) There was a wysiwyg editor that showed the content after it was processed by tidy.  </s>
<s> When the data was reloaded onto the page and displayed in the editor, the editor (HTMLArea 3) apparently translated the &amp;amp; values back into &amp;.  </s>
<s> I changed the page so it performs tidy after data has been submitted from page and stores the pure tidy processed data into the database.  </s>
<s> This solved the problem.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your help!  </s>
