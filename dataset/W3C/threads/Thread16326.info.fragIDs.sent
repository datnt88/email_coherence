<s> v.. AMERICA ONLINE, INC.,. Defendant.. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, the National Federation of the Blind, Inc. ("NFB"), the National Federation of the Blind of Massachusetts, Inc. ("NFB-MA"), Robert Baran, Steven Booth, Debra Delorey, Richard Downs, Priscilla Ferris, Michael Kosior, Theresa Jeraldi, Mary Ann Lareau, and Brandy Rose, by their undersigned counsel, complain against America Online, Inc. ("AOL") as follows: NATURE OF THE CASE Plaintiffs, blind advocacy organizations and several blind persons who wish to purchase and use Defendant's services, bring this action for injunctive and declaratory relief to require Defendant, the country's largest internet service provider, to bring its America Online internet service (the "AOL service") into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. ??12101, et seq.  </s>
<s> The individual Plaintiffs and members of the organizational Plaintiffs are blind, and therefore can only independently use computers, including internet services, by concurrently running screen access software programs for the blind that convert visual information into synthesized speech or braille.  </s>
<s> However, Defendant AOL has particularly designed its AOL service so that it is incompatible with screen access software programs for the blind.  </s>
<s> Despite its self-description as "the world's leader in interactive services, Web brands, Internet technologies, and electronic commerce services," AOL, in designing its AOL service, has failed to remove communications barriers presented by its designs thus denying the blind independent access to this service, in violation of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ??12181, et seq.  </s>
<s> JURISDICTION AND VENUE This action is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ?? 2201-02 and 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12188.  </s>
<s> This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 1331.  </s>
<s> Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 1391(b), in that the Defendant, a corporation, is subject to personal jurisdiction in this District and in that a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred and continue to occur in this District.  </s>
<s> THE PARTIES The National Federation of the Blind, the leading national organization of blind persons, is a not-for-profit corporation duly organized under the laws of the District of Columbia with its principal place of business in Baltimore, Maryland.  </s>
<s> It has affiliates in all 50 states, including Massachusetts.  </s>
<s> The vast majority of the Federation's approximately 50,000 members are blind and are therefore individuals with disabilities as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12102(2).  </s>
<s> The Federation is widely recognized by the public, the Congress, executive agencies of government, and the courts as a collective and representative voice on behalf of blind Americans and their families.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the NFB is to promote the general welfare of the blind by (1) assisting the blind in their efforts to integrate themselves into society on terms of equality and (2) removing barriers and changing social attitudes, stereotypes and mistaken beliefs held by sighted and blind persons concerning the limitations created by blindness that result in the denial of opportunity to blind persons in virtually every sphere of life, including education, employment, family and community life, transportation and recreation.  </s>
<s> The NFB and many of its members have long been actively involved in promoting adaptive technology for the blind, so that blind persons can live and work independently in today's technology-dependent world.  </s>
<s> The NFB runs the International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind in Baltimore, Maryland.  </s>
<s> This Center is the world's most extensive demonstration and evaluation center for computer-related technology serving the needs of blind persons, housing more than two million dollars worth of hardware and software designed specifically for the blind.  </s>
<s> Thousands of blind persons come to the Center each year for training in the use of adaptive equipment and software.  </s>
<s> Plaintiff NFB-Massachusetts, the Massachusetts state affiliate of the NFB, is a not- for-profit corporation duly organized under the laws of Massachusetts with its principal place of business in Massachusetts.  </s>
<s> The NFB-Massachusetts currently has seven local chapters and approximately 250 members, all of whom are residents of Massachusetts and many of whom are individuals with disabilities as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12102(2).  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Robert Baran, a blind resident of Chicopee, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> Mr. Baran is an adaptive technology specialist at Holyoke Community College, who works with blind and disabled students and is also a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  </s>
<s> Mr. Baran has computers on which he has installed screen access software and on which he utilizes e-mail and the internet.  </s>
<s> He has been repeatedly advised that the AOL service is inaccessible to blind people.  </s>
<s> He would like to be able to use the AOL service for its "buddy" feature and chat rooms.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Steven Booth, a blind resident of Salem, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12102(2).  </s>
<s> Mr. Booth is the Assistant Operations Manager at the National Braille Press and utilizes e-mail and the internet at home and at the office.  </s>
<s> If the AOL service were accessible to blind people, he would use it at home for surfing the web and for its various custom features, such as chat rooms and the "buddy" feature.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Debra Delorey, a blind resident of Holbrook, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> A recent college graduate who is currently applying to graduate school, Ms. Delorey received free AOL service with the computer she purchased with her scholarship money.  </s>
<s> Although she had purchased a combined screen enlarger/screen access program with a voice synthesizer, she was unable to use the AOL service because of her blindness.  </s>
<s> Her attempts to resolve the difficulties by calling the help line for the AOL service were unavailing and she gave it up.  </s>
<s> Ms. Delorey would subscribe to the AOL service if it were accessible for research over the internet and for e-mail.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Richard Downs, a blind resident of Stoughton, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> Mr. Downs has a home computer with a screen reader and voice synthesizer that he uses to access his computer.  </s>
<s> Four months ago, he was solicited by AOL to subscribe to its AOL service and advised AOL that he would like to subscribe, but that because of his blindness he cannot access its service.  </s>
<s> He was urged to subscribe anyway, because, he was told, AOL will eventually have a blind-accessible text screen alternative.  </s>
<s> Mr. Downs would like to subscribe to the AOL service because he believes that it provides access to a great number of web sites, would give him greater independence from the person whom he employs as a reader and would allow him to surf for electronics that assist the blind and to follow the activities of the National Federation of the Blind.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Priscilla Ferris, a blind resident of Somerset, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> She is the President of the NFB of Massachusetts, works as a consultant, and volunteers for the Girl Scouts.  </s>
<s> Her two daughters are AOL subscribers and two of her four grandchildren use the AOL service.  </s>
<s> She has a home computer with a screen access program and would like to be able to use the "buddy" feature of the AOL service with her family, visit chat rooms and, among other uses, employ it to get information from the District Councils and National Office of the Girl Scouts.  </s>
<s> She also is interested in being able to activate child safety features to block inappropriate content from her home computer, so that her grandchildren could surf the web for educational purposes without being exposed to inappropriate content.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important to her as a blind grandparent, as she cannot simply look over the shoulders of her grandchildren to monitor their internet use in her home.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Theresa Jeraldi, a blind resident of Watertown, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> She is a retired employee of the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education and has a computer with a voice activated screen reader, internet service and the capability of surfing the web through Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, she would subscribe to AOL's service if it were accessible, because she has many sighted relatives, including her grandchildren, who have the AOL service, and she could then utilize AOL's "buddy" feature to chat with them when they are on-line.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Michael Kosior, a blind resident of Allston, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> Mr. Kosior is a computer systems engineer for a $700 million direct marketing agency in Boston.  </s>
<s> He has a Bachelor of Science degree in computer information systems from Bryant College and worked as a computer programmer for the United States Navy while he was in high school.  </s>
<s> Mr. Kosior is an experienced user of the internet and communicates frequently by email.  </s>
<s> He utilizes several screen access programs for the blind, including DECtalk Express External Synthesizer and Henter-Joyce's Jaws for Windows Build 3.31.  </s>
<s> Mr. Kosior has made several attempts to utilize the AOL service without success.  </s>
<s> With the assistance of a sighted person he was able to label some of the graphics with the Jaws graphic labeler, but not enough to make the AOL service accessible.  </s>
<s> Mr. Kosior understands that AOL is easy for sighted people to use and is interested in evaluating whether the AOL service, once it is accessible to the blind, is superior to other internet access platforms that he currently uses.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Mary Ann Lareau, a blind resident of Waltham, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> As the Secretary of NFB-MA, it is her responsibility to handle all of the e-mail to the state affiliate; in connection with the lobbying and other work that she does for the affiliate, she has a constant need to surf the web for relevant information.  </s>
<s> While she currently uses another, accessible, internet service provider, she would like to subscribe to the AOL service, because of the additional features that it provides.  </s>
<s> The plaintiff, Brandy Rose, a blind resident of Taunton, Massachusetts, is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?12102(2).  </s>
<s> Ms. Rose has a home computer with screen reader software installed.  </s>
<s> Through another, accessible, internet service provider, she currently has e-mail.  </s>
<s> Ms. Rose, however, is aware that AOL advertises that its service has many features not available from other companies offering similar services and would, if it were accessible, subscribe to the AOL service for use in connection with her college classes and to chat with her sighted friends who subscribe to AOL's services, through use of the services "buddy" feature.. Defendant AOL is a for-profit corporation duly organized under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of business in Dulles, Virginia.  </s>
<s> It describes itself as "the world's leader in interactive services, Web brands, Internet technologies, and electronic commerce services," having revenues in excess of 4.7 billion dollars and total assets in excess of 5.3 billion dollars in fiscal year 1999.  </s>
<s> AOL's main internet service, the AOL service, has approximately 17.6 million customers ("members") worldwide.  </s>
<s> AOL purposely avails itself of, and persistently directs its commercial activities to, residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and has many members in Massachusetts from whom it derives substantial revenue.  </s>
<s> The AOL service includes, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, the following: simple access to the world wide web with search functionality; an "online interactive community" through electronic mail services, alerts when fellow members are on-line (the "buddy list"), public bulletin boards, public and private interactive conversations ("chat rooms"), guest interviews at live "auditorium" events; nineteen "channels" providing informational content and commerce and community opportunities pertaining to news, sports, games, finance, shopping, health, travel, kids, and the like; as well as personalization and control features that permit AOL members to, for example, automatically update their stock portfolios and block their children's access to inappropriate web sites.  </s>
<s> On information and belief, the AOL service has achieved over 1.14 million simultaneous users and the exchange of over 534 million electronic mail messages a day.  </s>
<s> The AOL service is a public accommodation as defined by Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12181(7), in that it is a place of exhibition and entertainment, a place of public gathering, a sales and rental establishment, a service establishment, a place of public display, a place of education, and a place of recreation.  </s>
<s> FACTS People who are blind, including the individual Plaintiffs and members of the organizational Plaintiffs, can and do use computer programs, including commercial applications designed to run under both the DOS operating system and the Windows operating system.  </s>
<s> The information that is displayed on the screen by the computer programs is made available non-visually to blind computer users by means of a class of software referred to as screen access programs.  </s>
<s> Screen access programs monitor the computer screen and convert the textual information displayed into synthesized speech or Braille on a device known as a refreshable Braille display.  </s>
<s> For screen access programs to function effectively in the Windows operating system environment, it is necessary for commercial applications to function in a standard way.  </s>
<s> Among other things, the commercial application must provide textual labels for all graphics, permit keyboard access to all functions, move the focus whenever the keyboard is used, and rely upon standard Windows controls (e.g., dialog boxes, combination boxes, list boxes, edit boxes, and push buttons).  </s>
<s> Screen access programs cannot read an unlabeled graphic, generally cannot provide an effective way to manipulate a mouse pointer, and generally cannot read or activate non-standard, custom controls that are painted on the screen.  </s>
<s> Unlike some other internet service providers, AOL requires the user to run proprietary AOL software in order to access and use the AOL internet service.  </s>
<s> This software can operate only under the Windows operating system or on the Macintosh platform.  </s>
<s> AOL's proprietary software for the AOL internet service does not function in the standard way required for screen access programs to effectively monitor the computer screen and to fully convert the information into synthesized speech or a refreshable Braille display.  </s>
<s> Among other things, AOL's proprietary software employs (a) unlabeled graphics, (b) commands that cannot be activated by using the keyboard but which instead can only be activated by using the mouse, and (c) custom controls painted on the screen.  </s>
<s> Indeed, what often appears to be text-such as the listing of channels-are in fact unlabeled graphics.  </s>
<s> As a result, by way of illustration and not by limitation, the following features of the AOL service are inaccessible to the blind: a.  </s>
<s> To sign up for the AOL service, the user must fill out a sign-up form containing blank fields to be filled in with name, billing address, credit card number, and similar information.  </s>
<s> Although text describing each field is displayed on the computer screen, the method AOL has used to display the text does not provide screen access programs with sufficient information to tell the blind user which piece of data is being requested in each blank field.  </s>
<s> Therefore, blind users are denied the independent ability even to sign up for the AOL internet service.  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> Once logged on, the user is faced with the "Welcome" screen, a very unwelcoming place for blind users.  </s>
<s> There is some text on the screen that screen access programs can read; however, most of what appears as text are actually graphics that cannot be read by a screen access program and the icon labels on the "Welcome" screen do not use standard Windows formatting for labels, but are themselves graphics as well.  </s>
<s> This includes such features as "favorites," "parental controls," and chat rooms.  </s>
<s> c. Locating the space for entering a keyword search or a web address cannot be directly accomplished by a blind user, but with trial and error and a great deal of difficulty, a blind user can bring up the browser and give it an instruction.  </s>
<s> However, unlike other web browsing software, AOL's browser operates in such a way that screen access software does not register that a browser is running.  </s>
<s> Thus, when the result of the search appears on the screen, the screen access program-and the blind user-is unaware that anything new is on the screen to be read.  </s>
<s> The screen access software feature for tabbing through hypertext links, a common way for blind users to explore a web page, can also fail to activate because the screen access software can fail to register that the user is running a browser.  </s>
<s> Because the AOL service is not independently accessible to the individual Plaintiffs and to members of the organizational Plaintiffs, they have been denied the opportunity to use the AOL service's many features, including AOL's "online interactive community" (electronic mail services, "buddy list" feature, public bulletin boards, public and private "chat rooms,"and "auditorium" events), AOL's nineteen "channels" providing informational content and commerce and community opportunities pertaining to news, sports, games, finance, shopping, health, travel, kids, and other subjects, as well as AOL's personalization and control features that permit members to automatically update their stock portfolios, for example, or block their children's access to inappropriate web sites.  </s>
<s> Without injunctive relief, individual Plaintiffs and members of the organizational Plaintiffs will continue to be unable to independently access and use Defendant's AOL service in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the ADA.  </s>
<s> Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  </s>
<s> CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT I Violation of the ADA's Communication Barriers Removal Mandate The allegations of fact contained in the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  </s>
<s> Defendant's failure to redesign its AOL internet service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs violates the communication barriers removal provision of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12182 (b)(2)(A)(iv), because it constitutes a failure to remove existing communication barriers from the service.  </s>
<s> Redesigning the AOL service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs is readily achievable.  </s>
<s> COUNT II Violation of the ADA's Auxiliary Aids and Services Mandate The allegations of fact contained in the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  </s>
<s> Defendant's failure to redesign its AOL internet service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs violates the auxiliary aids and services provision of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), because it constitutes a failure to take steps to ensure that individuals who are blind are not denied access to the service.  </s>
<s> Providing auxiliary aids and services that would make Defendant's AOL service accessible to and independently usable by persons who are blind would neither fundamentally alter the nature of Defendant's service, nor unduly burden Defendant.  </s>
<s> COUNT III Violation of ADA's Reasonable Modification Mandate The allegations of fact contained in the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  </s>
<s> Defendant's failure to redesign its AOL internet service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs violates the reasonable modifications provisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), in that it constitutes a failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices and procedures necessary to afford access to the service to persons who are blind.  </s>
<s> Modifying its policies, practices and procedures to afford access to its AOL service to persons who are blind by redesigning the service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs would not fundamentally alter the nature of Defendant's AOL service.  </s>
<s> COUNT IV Violation of the ADA's Full and Equal Enjoyment of Services Mandate The allegations of fact contained in the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  </s>
<s> Defendant's failure to redesign its AOL internet service to permit the blind to use it through screen access programs violates the full and equal enjoyment and participation provisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?? 12182(a), 12182(b)(1)(A)(i), and 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii), in that it constitutes a failure to make the service fully accessible and independently usable by individuals who are blind.  </s>
<s> PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Honorable Court grant the following relief: (a) Declare that Defendant's actions and inactions with respect to its AOL internet service violate Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
<s> 12182; (b)Enjoin Defendant from continuing to violate the ADA and order Defendant to redesign its AOL service and take such other and further steps as are necessary to allow independent access through screen access programs by persons who are blind; and (c)Grant Plaintiffs such other relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate, including an award of Plaintiffs' reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses and costs under 42 U.S.C. ?  </s>
