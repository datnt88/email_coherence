Based on our discussion last week, here is a draft of an alternate proposal for a new "our-host" extension element (renamed to distinguish from the previous proposal's "known-host") with a different semantic meaning. 
Also included is an extension to the compact policy P3P header to support the same mechanism for compact policies. 
Please review this new proposal and compare to the previous proposal. 
Is it more straightforward? 
Might it be less confusing for implementers and user agent developers? 
Thanks. 
I will probably be late to the call and may have some trouble participating verbally, as I will be coming from a dental appointment.

There seems to be something wrong with the initial argument: The existing P3P spec says: 
"A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to URIs on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references it. 
Thus, for example, a policy reference file at the well-known location of host www.example.com 
can apply policies only to resources on www.example.com." 
So when you say "forinstance.com is configured to return the HTTP header P3P: policyref="http://www.example.com/w3c/p3p.xml" 
This policyref can only apply to files on www.example.com 
Have I missed something in this discussion?

I think the problem is the ambiguity of the word "it" in the sentence: 
We have been interpreting this sentence to mean: 
A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to URIs on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references the policy 
reference file. 
Thus in Jack's example, if forinstance.com 
returns a P3P header, the policy reference file it references gets applied to forinstance.com. 
I am pretty sure that is how it has been implemented in IE6, Netscape7, and PrivacyBird.

Do you think this was the intention of the WG? 
I think in our discussion last week we talked about something even simpler. 
We suggested that there was not a need to have a two-way handshake. 
A site should be able to use our-host even if the host it is referring to does not point to its PRF. 
So... an our-host tag in a POLICY-REF would mean that for any URIs covered by this policy, any embedded content (anything that would be 
covered by a HINT element) that is served from a URI covered by the our-host tag should be considered as coming from the entity or its agents (or entities for whom it is acting as an agent). 
[not very well said, but hopefully, you can tell what I mean] And, an our-host token in a CP would mean that any cookies served with the current page that domain match the our-host tag should be considered as coming from the entity or its agents (or entities for whom it is acting as an agent).

Yes, I'm sure that was the intention of the WG.... we spent many, many hours discussing this point. 
(And you would think we would have managed to come up with a non-ambiguous way of saying it...) Lorrie 
Assuming Lorrie's reading of "it" overcomes Giles' point, I see this answering a number of problems, but leaving a number of folks with pre-existing arcitechtures out in the cold. 
I am speaking specifically of ad servers like ourselves and content delivery networks. 
If a CDN has hierarchically structured their tag from left to right and can dynamically generate P3P: policyref headers than all things are perfect, but practically speaking a CDN may host images as follows: This presents a world more difficulty than had the set up been: But in practice the former is quite common. 
Adding to this the list is HUGE and highly dynamic. 
In the ad serving world there is also the complication that a single URL and cookie replay would need to refer to multiple our hosts. 
Because the data collected by discreet tag may in fact belong to the advertiser and the publisher. 
Another difficulty here is the CP OHO mechanism. 
If CPs are only issued on cookie set, the vast majority of replays will likely be to hosts specifying other policies thru the dynamic P3P: policyref mechanism, with other policies - which essentially defeats the use of CPs??? Am I missing something here?

On Behalf Of Lorrie Cranor I think the problem is the ambiguity of the word "it" in the sentence:
