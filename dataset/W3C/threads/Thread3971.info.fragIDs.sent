<s> Based on our discussion last week, here is a draft of an alternate proposal for a new "our-host" extension element (renamed to distinguish from the previous proposal's "known-host") with a different semantic meaning.  </s>
<s> Also included is an extension to the compact policy P3P header to support the same mechanism for compact policies.  </s>
<s> Please review this new proposal and compare to the previous proposal.  </s>
<s> Is it more straightforward?  </s>
<s> Might it be less confusing for implementers and user agent developers?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I will probably be late to the call and may have some trouble participating verbally, as I will be coming from a dental appointment.  </s>
<s> ++Jack++  </s>
<s> There seems to be something wrong with the initial argument: The existing P3P spec says:  </s>
<s> "A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to URIs on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references it.  </s>
<s> Thus, for example, a policy reference file at the well-known location of host www.example.com  </s>
<s> can apply policies only to resources on www.example.com."  </s>
<s> So when you say "forinstance.com is configured to return the HTTP header P3P: policyref="http://www.example.com/w3c/p3p.xml"  </s>
<s> This policyref can only apply to files on www.example.com  </s>

<s> A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to URIs on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references the policy  </s>
<s> reference file.  </s>
<s> Thus in Jack's example, if forinstance.com  </s>
<s> returns a P3P header, the policy reference file it references gets applied to forinstance.com.  </s>
<s> I am pretty sure that is how it has been implemented in IE6, Netscape7, and PrivacyBird.  </s>

<s> Do you think this was the intention of the WG?  </s>
<s> I think in our discussion last week we talked about something even simpler.  </s>
<s> We suggested that there was not a need to have a two-way handshake.  </s>
<s> A site should be able to use our-host even if the host it is referring to does not point to its PRF.  </s>
<s> So... an our-host tag in a POLICY-REF would mean that for any URIs covered by this policy, any embedded content (anything that would be  </s>
<s> covered by a HINT element) that is served from a URI covered by the our-host tag should be considered as coming from the entity or its agents (or entities for whom it is acting as an agent).  </s>
<s> [not very well said, but hopefully, you can tell what I mean] And, an our-host token in a CP would mean that any cookies served with the current page that domain match the our-host tag should be considered as coming from the entity or its agents (or entities for whom it is acting as an agent).  </s>
<s> Lorrie  </s>
<s> Yes, I'm sure that was the intention of the WG.... we spent many, many hours discussing this point.  </s>
<s> (And you would think we would have managed to come up with a non-ambiguous way of saying it...) Lorrie  </s>
<s> Assuming Lorrie's reading of "it" overcomes Giles' point, I see this answering a number of problems, but leaving a number of folks with pre-existing arcitechtures out in the cold.  </s>
<s> I am speaking specifically of ad servers like ourselves and content delivery networks.  </s>
<s> If a CDN has hierarchically structured their tag from left to right and can dynamically generate P3P: policyref headers than all things are perfect, but practically speaking a CDN may host images as follows: This presents a world more difficulty than had the set up been: But in practice the former is quite common.  </s>
<s> Adding to this the list is HUGE and highly dynamic.  </s>
<s> In the ad serving world there is also the complication that a single URL and cookie replay would need to refer to multiple our hosts.  </s>
<s> Because the data collected by discreet tag may in fact belong to the advertiser and the publisher.  </s>
<s> Another difficulty here is the CP OHO mechanism.  </s>
<s> If CPs are only issued on cookie set, the vast majority of replays will likely be to hosts specifying other policies thru the dynamic P3P: policyref mechanism, with other policies - which essentially defeats the use of CPs??? Am I missing something here?  </s>
