<s> "A path is always defined for a URI, though the defined path may be empty (zero length) or opaque (not containing any "/" delimiters)" The production for net-path says that abs-path is optional, so for a URI like http://ABCD?query, we have both abs-path and rel-path undefined and not empty and therefore path would be undefined.  </s>
<s> Do we still have to assume  </s>
<s> that path is empty even when both abs-path and rel-path are undefined ?  </s>

<s> Bummer.  </s>
<s> The statement is correct, but I'll need to fix the ABNF so that it always ends up with a matching production.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the report, ....Roy  </s>
<s> I've been playing with an experimental grammar modification that addresses this problem and also addresses the following additional wrinkle: http://ABCD+y is a legal URI according to the ABNF (as translated to regexps by abnf2re).  </s>
<s> parseURI('http://ABCD+y')  </s>
<s> ('http', None, '//ABCD+y', None, None) That is, because ABCD+y is not a legal authority, the regular expression matching rules for http://ABCD+y backtrack to accept //ABCD+y as a path.  </s>
<s> To address both the problem reported by Mark and the problem above, I have found that there may be merit to simplifying the URI production to directly reflect the opening statement of section 3: "The generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of components referred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment."  </s>
<s> URI = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]  </s>
<s> This rule reflects the five-component structure and the statement that a path always exists, even if it is empty.  </s>
<s> It can be made to work with either of the two following definitions of path: path = abs-path / rel-path path = segment *( "/" segment )  </s>
<s> Running a parser based on either of these changes with all the test cases listed in section 5.4 (both normal and abnormal examples) gives precisely the same results as with the grammar of bis-02 or bis-03.  </s>
<s> (By the way, it might be good to have some IPv6 literals in the test examples.)  </s>
<s> On the problem case of http://ABCD+y, the following results.  </s>
<s> parseURI('http://ABCD+y')  </s>
<s> ('http', 'ABCD', '+y', None, None) Arguably, this is a better parse if http://ABCD+y is to be accepted as a URI.  </s>
<s> It is also a better parse if http://ABCD+y is to be ruled out by the extra-grammatical restriction: "when an authority exists, the path must either be empty or an abs-path."  </s>
<s> (Alternatively, "when an authority exists, the first segment of the path must be empty.")  </s>
<s> Overall, I think the theme of grammar simplification reflected in the change from bis02 to bis03 is a good idea.  </s>
<s> One other area that could use some attention is the grammar of IPv6 literals.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> This was a great suggestion -- it vastly simplifies the grammar and associated text.  </s>
<s> I chose the latter and removed abs-path, net-path, and rel-path.  </s>
