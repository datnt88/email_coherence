8: Mime type registration 9: TAG Architecture Doc review We have Graham's Jan - were you the other reviewer? 
snip In response to this, I've done another check of the Primer Editor's Draft (the pre-publication Recommendation version) and have found a few glitches (or possible glitches): 1. 
The boilerplate just before the Abstract says "The English version of this specification is the only normative version." 
But the Primer isn't normative. 
Is this a problem? 
2. Similarly, under "Status of this Document", the second para says "It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document". 
I know this is boilerplate, but once again, the Primer isn't normative. 
3. Under "Status of this Document", the URLs in the "set of six" cited are not the staged URIs, and so the global replace presumably won't find these. 
NB: This also seems to be true of the other documents where this boilerplate is used (so far, I've seen it in Concepts and Syntax). 
4. "Status of this Document" only cites changes since the PR working draft. 
(a) Are the other change log entries to be deleted? 
(b) If so, there are anchors in the text that some of these entries point to (to highlight where the changes were made). 
Should those anchors be removed or left in place (IOW, how clean do you want the source to be)? 5. In Section 2.1 (and also in Appendix B) the URL that "Extensible Markup Language" points to is a dated version of the XML spec, but not the dated version cited in the references. 
So the URL will have to either be updated or removed (leaving just the pointer to the [XML] reference). 
6. 
In the Normative References, the "cite" URL for RDF Concepts points to the 12/15 WD rather than being a staged URI, so the global replace won't find this.
