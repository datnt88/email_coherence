<s> (sorry for the slow reply, I am slowly catching up with email after returning from vacation)  </s>
<s> I believe so.  </s>
<s> There is an extra option on the form that says: ... [ ] This permission applies to any messages I send to any W3C list in the future.  </s>
<s> No need to ask me again.  </s>
<s> Do you recall if you selected that option or not?  </s>

<s> Hi, I suspect not.  </s>
<s> Is it obvious that it requires selection?  </s>
<s> I might have thought it was information telling me I won't be asked again.  </s>
<s> It has been a while.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to see the screen without sendingmail again to the group?  </s>

<s> Sorry, no, but the next time you post to a list that uses this system you will have another chance to choose that option when submitting the form.  </s>
<s> I attached a sample of the form.  </s>

<s> Apparently posting to this list asked me the question.  </s>
<s> I don't recall if i checked the box or not.  </s>
<s> The way it's laid out I could have missed it.  </s>
<s> Having a checkbox within a radio set is a bit odd, no?  </s>
<s> I'll be careful to check it and see what happens.  </s>
