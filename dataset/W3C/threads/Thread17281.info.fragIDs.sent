<s> I'm looking at making accessible an educational website for an FE college and while looking at inclusiveness of people with learning difficulties, Something struck me.  </s>
<s> I think, maybe a potential standardisation missing which may help many people.  </s>
<s> What I'm interested in is the use of icons on web pages as the main meaning representation for links (see Jonathan Chetwynd's web site at  </s>
<s> Is there any development of a global standard for meanings of icons / pictograms so that meanings become standard like text?  </s>
<s> I ask this because the constant replies I get, is to work with students to  </s>
<s> invent our own - this is reasonable for our Intranet where support is easily given but potential future students (our web sites target audience) may not perceive them with the same meaning, which could cause confusion.  </s>
<s> These could be developed in the same way different people require (and can choose) use of different fonts (for languages / families locales).  </s>
<s> They could also be defined WAI?  </s>
<s> I'd be interested to hear comments on this.  </s>

<s> Hi David, yes there is quite a lot of work in this area.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately it has almost no profile at all in WAI discussions at the moment.  </s>
<s> There are several  </s>
<s> symbol sets that are implemente in a range of software (chat, email, document composition, etc) - Bliss, PCS, Widgit, and a couple of others whose names aren't at the tip of my tongue.  </s>
<s> If you follow Jonathan's work closer you might find references to the WWAAC group, and the CCF or Concept Coding Framework which they are developing [1].  </s>
<s> This is a semantic-web based approach to identifying  </s>
<s> concepts, and then things that represent them - which turns out to work quite well for symbol-based systems, and in addition allows for easy customisation - for example I can use a photo of me instead of a symbol for "me".  </s>
<s> I can use SVG symbols so I can style things appropriately.  </s>
<s> Jonathan often talks about the red-bus/green-bus problem, where if people see a symbol for bus and it is red they interpret that as important, and ignore all the passing buses because they happen to be green.  </s>
<s> I did some mock-ups of how to do this in SVG, and hope to get a simple SVG-based demo quality authoring system running soon.  </s>
<s> You might like to look at an example (note that the RDF included uses a whole lot of undeclared dummy properties - it has the rough shape of the real thing, but has been "greeked" - dummy text used) [2].  </s>
<s> One of the big issues is copyright - none of these symbol sets are freely available in the way that words and letters are - you have to pay for them.  </s>
<s> This has been a barrier to interoperability and communication.  </s>
<s> Again, interesting developments include the fact that the Unicode consortium are looking at including bliss symbols in Unicode, which would actually mean the specific concepts encoded by bliss, since the images that represent them are just like different fonts.  </s>
<s> So I think it isn't such a bad idea to develop symbols if you're going to give them away, but if you are not it would be cheaper, and probably more interoperable, to just buy a license for some software that includes a decent sized symbol set.  </s>

<s> With our Special Education students, we use the symbols contained in the Mayer-Johnson (http://www.mayer-johnson.com/)  </s>
<s> product called Boardmaker.  </s>
<s> It contains numerous images that represent people, places, things, emotions, and much more.  </s>
<s> Teachers and speech therapists create "boards" with these images that students can use to communicate.  </s>
<s> In some instances, the student points to a series of pictures to tell the teacher something.  </s>
<s> In other cases, the teacher points to a picture to tell the student something.  </s>
<s> These pictures are also placed on objects around the room so the student can learn to associate the picture with the object.  </s>
<s> Boardmaker is a very popular software used in the Special Education world (at least in the U.S.) and would be very recognizable to a specific audience.  </s>
<s> The other nice feature about this product, is that each picture also comes with standard text that is also customizable.  </s>
<s> By including the text, individuals that are not familiar with the symbols can still understand the meaning, and once individuals become accustomed to seeing the symbols and text, they no longer need the text to recognize the symbol and it's meaning.  </s>
<s> I think that if the ALT attribute is used to provide the meaning for each symbol used, it would accomplish the same type of goal.  </s>
<s> Those that cannot "see" the symbol, still know what it's function is.  </s>
<s> Those that can "see" the symbol, can mouseover it to read the ALT text and still will know what it's function is.  </s>

<s> David Choosing standardized icons was one of the issues we faced when building ATutor.  </s>
<s> Though we found a few that seem relatively standard, such as a house for a home icon, and a magnifying glass for a search tool, many of the icons we used were picked because there was no better choice.  </s>
<s> One thing to keep in mind is that users learn to make the association between icons and the tools they represent relatively quick,despite the lack of standardization for these visual representations outside the application.  </s>
<s> While I think a small set of icons can be standardized, in a complex application like ATutor, there are many tools that will not be found on most sites, so representing them graphically in a standard way would be difficult.  </s>
<s> How to represent a course enrollment utility for example?  </s>
<s> ATutor was built for the primary purpose of accomodating students with learning difficulties.  </s>
<s> It uses a variety of strategies for presenting the interface as well as structuring the content.  </s>
<s> It's also fully accessible, and free.  </s>

<s> But over the next few days we're going to meeting internally to discuss how we can continue this work etc.  </s>
<s> I won't go into the project too much here as everything is on the website [1].  </s>

<s> Also, in response to Janet the PCS symbol set from mayer-johnson is a licensed set, so it is not likely you can just post them on your websites.  </s>

<s> Unicode is about the only place for this, and is where any open standard should get reflected.  </s>
<s> There are various "dingbat" and other pictorial icons in Unicode.  </s>
<s> There are also 10,000s of CJK icons, but these have become very abstracted (you could also say that the floppy disk icon for save is becoming a pure abstraction, because people don't use floppy disks any longer).  </s>
<s> A new iconic language ought to be considered as valid as Chinese (and risks becoming as complex).  </s>
<s> Representation of non-concrete objects is likely to very difficult to achieve because they will have to be represented indirectly and those representations are likely to be subject to cultural considerations (e.g. black for mourning is wrong in South Asia, where the mourning colour is white).  </s>
<s> In reality, in user interface design, apart from a few de facto standards, the remaining icons get invented by the designers, and may reflect an imagery theme for the product that has no relation to what the product actually does.  </s>
<s> They are normally there for frequent users.  </s>
<s> Occasional users typically have to hover the icon to find out what it means from the tool-tip.  </s>
