<s> I suggest that as we move toward XHTML or XML, we should use lower-case element type names and attribute names.  </s>
<s> We certainly should avoid a mixture.  </s>
<s> 6. Attribute Name Quoting XML and XHTML require that all attribute values must be quoted, either by matching "..." or '...'.  </s>
<s> That has not been consistently used in the WAI html documents.  </s>
