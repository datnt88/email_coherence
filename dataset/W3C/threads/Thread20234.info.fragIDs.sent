On WinNT, the Ctrl-Enter key sequence does not put a BR in. 
It appears to have no effect at all.

If you have the line Ctrl key Return: CreateBreak("\212") in the file amaya.kb 
wherever it installs your profiles, then there is a bug. 
Oterwise you just need to add this line ot hte file and restart Amaya. 
The Windows shortcut keys are way behind the linux ones unfortunately. 
Hopefully I will work on the windows version a little and have a better keyboard file available soon.

I checked the amaya.kb 
file and the line you propose is already there.

That means it is a bug, or there is a different mechanism for adding a break in Windows.

It's a bug in the Windows version. 
The function works but not the shortcut.
