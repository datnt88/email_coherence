<s> Ok, I have a problem with what I understand to be the display model for IDNA and IRI (and presumably by extension IMA).  </s>
<s> I'm assuming that the display model is 'render using bidi in an LTR context'.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the IRI draft says: When rendered, bidirectional IRIs MUST be rendered using the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [UNIV4], [UNI9].  </s>
<s> Bidirectional IRIs MUST be rendered with an overall left-to-right (ltr) direction.  </s>
<s> The latter requirement isn't specified in bidi-speak, but is presumably to be interpreted as saying they must be rendered at an even embedding level.  </s>
<s> Actually, this isn't quite enough in the general case, since what comes before the string may affect weak type resolution, but since IRIs generally start with a latin letter (generally 'h' :) this isn't really much of a problem.  </s>
<s> So lets for the moment assume that the display model is that IDNs, IRIs, IMAs are rendered at an even embedding level, such that the IDN/IRI/IMA constitutes the sole text in the level run.  </s>
<s> (This can easily be achieved by bracketing the string with LRE and PDF prior to rendering.) Consider the domain: 123.ARAB.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) 123.BARA.com  </s>
<s> (display order) now consider the domain: ARAB.123.com (logical order) 123.BARA.com  </s>
<s> (display order)  </s>
<s> Ergo, we need another display model; this one doesn't work, at least  </s>
<s> not if we don't want two completely different domains to display identically.  </s>
<s> I recall that there was a proposal on the IDN list that domains should always be rendered with the labels appearing in order, least significant to the left and top-level domain on the right.  </s>
<s> (This can be trivially achieved by bracketing each label with LRE/PDF, separating the labels with dots, and then bracketing the whole domain with LRE/PDF.) This would solve the above problem, but potentially might be less friendly to users of RTL languages in other ways.  </s>
<s> It also clearly is not what the authors of stringprep had in mind, since the bidi restrictions in stringprep are much stronger than would be necessary if this was the model.  </s>
<s> -roy  </s>
<s> There are also other real nasties with this display model:  </s>
<s> ARABIC.3com.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) 3.CIBARAcom.com  </s>
<s> (display order) ARABIC.3-com.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) 3.CIBARA-com.com  </s>
<s> (display order) HEBREW.3-com.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) 3-.WERBEHcom.com  </s>
<s> (display order) -roy  </s>
<s> Worse than that, I think the bidi restrictions in stringprep don't actually achieve their goal of ensuring that you can't have two different labels that render the same.  </s>
<s> Consider the labels: A-123,456B and A456,-123B Here, A is HEBREW LETTER ALEF, B is HEBREW LETTER BET (or any characters of bidi class R that you like, but *not* arabic letters, which are class AL) and the comma is actually ARABIC COMMA U+060C (or any character of class CS or ES).  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell these both pass nameprep with UseSTD13ASCIIRules set, and they both render identically under bidi as: B-123,456A If you don't care about UseSTD13ASCIIRules, you can replace ARABIC COMMA with COMMA, SOLIDUS or COLON.  </s>
<s> I fully expect someone to reply explaining why I'm mistaken, but I've checked the above as best I can... -roy  </s>
<s> According to my understanding, and to testing against the Unicode C reference implementation, you are correct in stating that the 2 strings ("A-123,456B" and "A456,-123B") will give the same display according to the Unicode algorithm for Bidirectional text.  </s>
<s> It proves that you have a more creative mind than the people who proposed the limitations for Bidi names in IRIs, at least more than mine.  </s>
<s> You will admit that your example is more than a little contrived.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> limitations set on IRIs intend to avoid ambiguity when converting from the display order to the logical order (which in this case is not achieved, although the vast majority of users would assume form A-123,456B, because the other form with the comma adjacent to a minus sign makes little sense in a domain name).  </s>
<s> But those limitations were also designed not to restrict too much the potential of creating interesting domain names, so a compromise had to be achieved.  </s>
<s> I can find other examples of names allowed by the rules which can mislead users trying to induce the logical order based on the display order.  </s>
<s> All of these examples are quite bizarre.  </s>
<s> By the way, can you give a reference to "UseSTD13ASCIIRules", for an ignoramus like myself?  </s>

<s> Thanks for verifying it.  </s>
<s> Though it's still possible that I'm mistaken about it passing nameprep.  </s>
<s> Yes, and it's probably unlikely ever to be registerable, since it involves punctuation (and not only that, but punctuation associated with the wrong script).  </s>

<s> Hence my use of ARABIC COMMA; I needed a character that was a number separator, was non-ASCII, and didn't have a compatibility decomposition (since IDNA uses NFKC).  </s>

<s> Hello Roy,  </s>
<s> I think that in general, you are right about your analysis.  </s>
<s> Having labels (or other components) with numbers only may lead to ambiguous displays.  </s>
<s> I seem to remember that we were actually aware of that fact, but there was not much to do about it:  </s>
<s> - There currently are labels with only digits in the DNS, outlawing them is not an option.  </s>
<s> (it would have been nice if we could have said that the same restrictions apply for digits and LTR letters as they do for digits and RTL letters) - Very explicitly for IDN, but also in many ways for IRIs, it is highly undesirable to have inforced restrictions on two or more labels/components.  </s>
<s> (note that this may be somewhat different for the LHS side) I have created an issue for this for the IRI draft, at  </s>
<s> I propose to address this by adding text that points out such cases and warns against them (without going as far as actually prohibiting them).  </s>
<s> I hope that this is acceptable for you.  </s>
<s> By the way, the alternative of having components displayed strictly LTR was what we had for a long time.  </s>
<s> The two problems with this approach are: - It does not seem to correspond with what Arabic and Hebrew writers do naturally, in particular for freestanding domain names.  </s>
<s> - It would require much more control over the contexts of IRI display than we think will be available (if we get an overall context of LTR reasonably widely implemented, I think we already have achieved something).  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> More specifically, assuming labels (or syntactic components) obey the stringprep bidi rules (as IDNA requires, and IRI has as a 'SHOULD') then I think the problematic case is when a label contains one or more digits, and no strong characters.  </s>
<s> These are just quick examples off the top of my head; I haven't checked them carefully against the bidi algorithm.  </s>
<s> 1-2.HEBREW.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) 1-2.WERBEH.com  </s>
<s> (display order) HEBREW.1-2.com (logical order) 1-2.WERBEH.com  </s>
<s> (display order) And another.  </s>
<s> N is a neutral character (presumably non-ASCII, since there are no ASCII neutrals allowed by hostname rules).  </s>
<s> 1N2.ABC.com (logical order) 1N2.CBA.com (display order) ABC.2N1.com (logical order) 1N2.CBA.com (display order) Of course, this may need to be restated somewhat for IMA because the LHS doesn't formally have structure.  </s>
<s> If we can't change the display model (and I see why that may not be desirable and/or practiable) then I guess that's all that can realistically be done.  </s>
<s> I'm tempted to say it ought to be a 'SHOULD NOT', and not just a recommendation (in line with the other 'SHOULD NOTs' about bidi IRIs).  </s>
<s> I think that IMA will need to contain a similar 'SHOULD NOT'.  </s>
<s> In the case of IMA we need to warn people (at least) against addresses such as: 123@ABC.com  </s>
<s> (logical order) ABC@123.com (logical order) both of which display as 123@CBA.com  </s>
<s> (display order) but I think there are other cases as well.  </s>

<s> Hello Roy, others, As proposed, I have added an additional example (example 10) in (and also in http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/BidiExamples).  </s>
