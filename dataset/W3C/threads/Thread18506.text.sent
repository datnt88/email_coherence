Hi Jon, Please consider the following items for discussion at the face-to-face meeting (this email for documentation purposes) in addition to what's on the issues list [0]: - Comments from Aaron Cohen on animation classes (issue 430). 
- Can checkpoints 3.5 and 3.6 (of 24 Feb draft [1]) be merged? 
Refer to comments from Al and Ian: - Definition of active element? 
- Are there any other formats than SMIL that allow caption positioning? 
- Reorder Guidelines (editorial)? 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/ [0] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html 
Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 I consider the order of guidelines and checkpoints to be editorial. 
Charles Hi Jon, Please consider the following items for discussion at the face-to-face meeting (this email for documentation purposes) in addition to what's on the issues list [0]: [snip] - Reorder Guidelines (editorial)? 
Thank you, - Ian Charles, While I see reordering the checkpoints as mostly an editorial issue, I think the group should discuss if the proposed reordering reflects the groups consensus of what the most important guidelines are. 
I don't think it will take that much time and I would encourage people to post their opinions to the list.
