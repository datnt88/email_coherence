We are trying to convert Word 2000 docs to XML. 
Our converter worked fine for W97 documents, but W2000 has a much different RTF format (tables especially). 
Does anyone know where I can get a hold of a spec for this version of RTF? thanks Kerri Golden kgolden@hynet.com 
Does anyone know how practical it would be to write an export filter using Word Basic? 
By the time Word exports the page to html, too much information has been lost. 
This is an especial problem for Word2000.
