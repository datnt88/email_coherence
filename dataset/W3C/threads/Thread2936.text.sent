hello, How can we get new HTTP headers created? 
Does such headers created, turn out to be vendor specific, to be used only by the vendors who registers it? 
Or once regsitered, any one can use it? 
And what are extended headers? 
Any info or pointers will be greatly appreciated TIA raj Currently, there is no official way to register HTTP header field-names. 
However, you may be interested in [1] a proposal on how such a registry would be run. 
Regards, 1. http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-msghdr-registry-05.txt hi, Thanks a lot for the reply. 
I am new to HTTP headers and its issues. 
I have one more doubt. 
I need to define a new HTTP header for communciation between my Server application, and other client application which connect to my Server application. 
If there is no official way to register HTTP header names, is it enough that I decide on the header name, and its value, etc? 
And let know my client applications about this new header through documentation? 
I need not register it anywhere now, isn't it? 
And if the proposed registry is up, probably I can get it registered there. 
Is this the way to do it? 
Thanks once again for your time.

Yes. 
You may want to name your header field starting with "X-" to avoid possible but unlikely collisions with [future] "official" header field names and to follow a tradition. 
For example: X-Rajmahendra: foo=bar You probably want to keep the value syntax simple so that intermediaries do not have trouble parsing or forwarding the values. 
If possible, avoid things like quoted strings with special delimiters inside, etc. 
If you header has a hop-by-hop semantics (see RFC 2616), you must list it in the Connection: header field. 
You do not need to register it.
