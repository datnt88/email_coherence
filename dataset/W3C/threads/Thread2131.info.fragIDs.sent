I have had several comments sent to me (most off the list) along the lines of "how can we keep changing 1.0 when there are deployed apps?" and "how can I know whether a server supports the standard or not if we continue to use the same version number?", etc. 
As we mentioned back in San Jose, we have a choice as to whether we try to standardize 1.0, or release a current-practice document on 1.0 and move our standard to HTTP/1.1 (which in turn would mean that what we are currently calling 1.1 features would be in HTTP/1.2). 
Since the IETF recently created the BCP ("Best Current Practice") series, we can actually do this now within a reasonable framework. 
The action required would be for Henrik and I to create a stripped-down HTTP/1.0 document and release it along with the current draft renamed as HTTP/1.1. 
This will take three days for us to accomplish, but may be worth the saving in confusion and aggravation. 
Does the WG want to do this?

I like it -- it would be nice to have a good spec for what to do to interoperate with the current deployed browsers/servers (warts and all...). 
I'd have second thoughts if you said it would take a long time, but if it can really be accomplished in a few days, and you're willing to do the work, I'd concur.

Roy Fielding: 
I see a number of advantages to this approach, and almost no disadvantages, except that it may take rather more than 2 times 3 person-days, if the BCP document is really meant to reflect the amount of http functionality that can be relied upon to be present today. 
In one area I am familiar with, redirection codes, best current practice would be `only 301 and 302 can be expected to work as specified, and only in responses to GET requests' (at least, that is my observation on doing experiments with browsers). 
Current support for redirection is rather less than what is specified in the 1.0-01 draft, so this points to the need for a BCP document. 
On the other hand, the redirection case shows that, to write a good BCP, a lot of information about the behavior of current web software will be needed, and this information may take a long time to get (either by doing experiments yourselves or by asking for information on www-talk). 
And of course, as soon as the BCP is released for review, you will get flamewars (i.e. large amounts of wasted time) on www-talk and http-wg along the lines of `well, I know that browsers X, Y, and Z do not support protocol feature P, but I call X, Y, and Z broken browsers because of this, so P needs to be in the BCP document nevertheless'.

YES! 6 man*days effort is worth for benefits. 
I'm sorry, but with my english knowledge I can't help in doing that.
