Hi, Amaya. 
This is a bug report in the UI. 
The steps to reproduce it are the following: 1- create new document 2- create a pre tag 3- paste some text, several lines 4- select all text and change color with Style = Colors 5- make a single selection including some characters of the end of a line and some characters at the beginning of the following line 6- change color of the selection using Style = Colors Color change operates right, but the second line is appended to the previous one The outcome is two tags, one with the ending chars of the first line and the other with the starting chars of the second line. 
The end-of-line between those two parts is lost. 
Saludos!
