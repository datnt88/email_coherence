Hi Team I was assigned Bug #506 in which Kansas Web Accessibility Subcommittee "Checkpoint 1.3: Clarify the definition of "structure" more. 
There should be a clear understanding of the difference between structure of code and layout of information. 
Example: Developers use xml to semantically mark up content but the output uses html/css to render screen layout." 
I had a good conversation with Frances Grenier, Public Service Administrator for the Kansas Rehabilitation Services, SRS, who wrote this. 
I send a summary of our entire conversation soon. 
She feels that there will be confusion among web masters as to whether we are speaking about layout of information or whether we are talking about code such as server side stuff (i.e., PHP) The answer, as I understand it, is that we are referring to both the layout and the code **as it is perceived by the user agent**. 
In other words we are not referring to programming on the back end except to the degree to which it is being sent to the client. 
Frances suggested the following rewording: Current: Guideline 1.3 "Ensure that information, functionality, and structure are separable from presentation" Frances' recommendation: "Ensure that information, functionality, and structure of the code and layout are separable from presentation" My recommendation is that it would perhaps be better to fix this in the appendix under the definition of "structure". 
Also our technical documents would give specific coding examples that would help clarify the guideline. 
I've added a sentence to the definition of "Structure" in the appendix. 
(I also fixed a typo and a spelling error that were in this definition) structure Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references, or the correspondence between header and data cells in a table. 
The hierarchical structure of content represents changes in context. 
For example, 1.A book is divided into chapters, paragraphs, lists, etc. Chapter titles help the reader anticipate the meaning of the following paragraphs. 
Lists clearly indicate separate, yet related ideas. 
All of these divisions help the reader anticipate changes in context. 
2.A bicycle is divided into wheels and a frame. 
Further, a wheel is divided into a tire and a rim. 
In an image of the bicycle, one group of circles and lines becomes "wheel" while another group becomes "frame." 
new We refer to structure as it is perceived by a User Agent such as a browser on the client side. 
/new I think putting the details in the definitions is a good idea. 
Two concerns with the definition below though. 
1 - tables are listed as non-hierarchical which is not really best. 
Would suggest tables be moved out from the 'non-hierarchical" category and put by themselves in the same sentence. 
2 - the picture example may imply that we are requiring that all pictures be done in SVG and be fully marked up in hierarchical fashion. 
I think that example might be better in techniques where it can be explained better and looked at as where we want to go someday - not what is required for level 1 conformance - which is implied by making part of the definition of the term used in level 1 Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Ind.

/new Hi David, Yes - I know that you didn't edit that part - but when you reposted them - the other bugs showed up. 
So I thought we should clean them up as we do this. 
I think a table is hierarchical (though it is also two (or more) dimensional). 
What if we just drop the "table" sentence since I don't think we need it - and no use getting into a bunch of discussion about whether it is hierarchical or not. 
That would leave: structure Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references.

/new I'm concerned that we're defining "structure" in a way that's still very HTML-specific. 
In the proposal below, I've tried to begin finding ways of talking about structure for other languages/technologies such as MathML and SVG. 
I very much doubt that I've got it right, but I'm hoping this will help expand the discussion. 
I'll begin with a proposal, and follow that with a dictionary definition of "structure" from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary. 
I've taken a look at the way the SVG spec [1] defines "document structure," and also at the way the MathML spec [2] talks about what presentation elements present. 
structure Structure refers to the set of elements and relationships that make up a Web resource. 
Elements may contain text, graphics, mathematical equations, etc. 
Some elements may contain other elements, and may also define relationships between two or more elements. 
We User agents, including Web browsers and some assistive technologies, make the structure of Web resources evident to the user. 
Some relationships are hierarchical. 
For example, an HTML document may contain multiple sections. 
Each section begins with an HTML heading element ( h1 ... h6 ) that contains the title of the section or sub-section. 
The heading element may also show the logical relationship of one section or sub-section to the sections and sub-sections before and after it. 
In MathML, certain elements are used to show the syntactic structure of mathematical notation-for example, to make it clear that calculations have to be performed in a specific order. 
In SVG, certain elements (such as the g element) are used to define groups of related graphical objects and to provide information about the document's structure. 
Some relationships are non-hierarchical. 
For example, non-hierarchical relationships may be created by links between one part of the document and another part, or between the document and another resource.
