I channel surfed into the middle of a TV news report describing a new windows software for the net that claims it can digest the Internet environment more successfully than any previous screen reader, including tables and such. 
The wonderful news reporters (on our local station in Birmingham) didn't bother to repeat the name of the software so I never heard it but I believe the author is someone named Ted Hinton (he has a vision disability and owns the software company). 
I'm trying to check back with the station to see if I can find any additional info, but I'm wondering if anyone on the list has heard of this? 
his name is ted henter and the screenreader is jfw or jaws for windows and well, it's not new. 
it does work in the pending release fabulously for those using ie 4.01 Hands-On-Technolog(eye)s touching the internet voice: 1-(301) 949-7599 poehlman@clark.net

Hi, The program you are talking about is called Jaws for Windows made by Henter-Joyce. 
You can get full details on the program at In terms of being new, well the program has actually been around for quite sometime. 
They are currently testing a new release that works with IE 4 to create web pages that display more like the Lynx web browser has done for a long time, i.e. pages that use tables to create multiple columns are displayed sequentially rather than side-by-side. 
JFW is one of several Windows screen reading packages on the market. 
All have different techniques for making the web more readable. 
To my knowledge JFW is the first to finally work with IE 4 but other companies are testing their strategies. 
Sounds like Ted Henter, the owner and President of Henter-Joyce, makers of the JAWS for Windows screen reader. 
For more information, go to They were recently featured on the American television news magazine, "60 Minutes."
