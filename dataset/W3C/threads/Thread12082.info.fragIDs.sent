With regard to the proposed changes for ATAG v2. 
I have now talked with several Product Groups here at MS, and the general feeling is that they do not like the idea of including "at a minimum" within any of the guidelines or sub text. 
Some examples of their concerns: *Including text like "at a minimum could lower the bar, to allow product groups to only do that minimum level of work. 
As apposed to allowing individual companies to define their own minimum, or standard, that they want product groups to follow. 
*ATAG should not be telling product groups how to implement guidelines. 
The techniques document should be used to show examples of how a range of products met a given guideline. 
*"The minimum" for one product could be something totally different than the WAIs suggestion as the minimum, does that mean it's wrong? 
Even if ATAG doesn't think so, others may. 
*Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution?

Interesting... In fact I've just started to adopt the pair "at minimum - ideally" for specifications and similar I write (or add commnets to) for Macromedia. 
And pointed this out to my colleagues as a nice, "human-readable" way to distinguish priority levels... 
I think it's important to make a difference between WAI guidelines and techniques. 
Guidelines, if well formulated, do *not* tell anyone "how" to implement something, just a minimal requirement for functionality. 
"At minimum" in this context should indicate that such functionality should -somehow- be provided; if not, there is no conformance. 
If you're talking about a "more advanced solution", then "solution" means technique to me. 
As long as that implementation technique meets the functional requirement of the "at minimum" in the guideline, it conforms. 
As I see it, "at minimum" would not lower the bar in any way. 
It just tells you what you have to conform to - not how. 
We still have P1. P2 and P3. Well formulated, "at minimum" would be the same for all products, not something totally different for different products. 
Example: If we say that "at minimum" you have to provide a way to navigate the structure of the document being edited, that does not tell anyone how to do that. 
A structure view would be a nice solution, but find-find again would work, too (just not as nice). 
Short comments below. 
A minimum is just that. 
You are always free to have a "higher" standard. 
Yes. Techniques give only suggestions for how something could be implemented. 
Only guidelines should use "at minimum". 
Well-formulated guidelines apply to all technologies they say they apply to. 
An advanced solution would implement the minimum.

aloha, heather! 
i am in philosophical agreement with the points outlined in your post, in particular the first bulleted point, quote Including text like "at a minimum could lower the bar, to allow product groups to only do that minimum level of work. 
As apposed to allowing individual companies to define their own minimum, or standard, that they want product groups to follow. 
unquote this is a very real danger inherent in the concept of explicitly stating a minimal satisfactory implementation of a checkpoint, and yet, when WAI guidelines (such as the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) do not contain explicit requirements for minimally satisfying a checkpoint, the working groups have received requests from developers, claiming that the affiliated Techniques documents, due to their informative/non-normative status, cannot sufficiently address what is minimally required to satisfy a particular checkpoint... so, while i share your concern about the potential straitjacketing effect normative minimal requirements may have upon developers, there is also a clear need to define normatively what exactly constitutes minimal satisfaction of the checkpoint in question... for example, what use would it be to simply state that a user agent MUST offer a search facility, if the basic parameters for a search facility aren't explicitly stated? the ability to search is the absolute minimum, but the ability to search is quite an amorphous concept, so the base functionality necessary for a UAAG conformance claim is spelled out explictly in the User Agent Guidelines [reference 1] as for your last point, quote Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution? 
unquote, while the answer is, "yes", the reply is not as onerous as one might assume... i know from my experience as a member of the User Agent working group that what the UA WG intends by expressing minimal requirements for checkpoints is to express the functionality necessary to minimally satisfy the checkpoint, and NOT the mechanism whereby the functionality is achieved -- that, as you correctly point out, is fodder for the Techniques document... granted, in order to express the minimal functionality required by a checkpoint, it may be necessary to more explicitly reference specific markup languages, but where the User Agent WG found it necessary to explicitly state base functionality with reference to a specific markup language or modality, the minimal requirements are References 1. http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/

aloha, all! 
please ignore my previous post, which somehow escaped the bonds of my system autonomously, due to a virtual device driver freeze that caused all input via the keyboard to be input as if depressed in conjunction with the ALT key, with the result that, when i typed an "s", the message was unexpectedly sent in an unfinished state, and i apparently wasn't able to "stop" transmission, even though outlook express told me that i had been successful in stopping the send... in any event, what follows is my completed post... --- RESENT MESSAGE --- From: "gregory j. rosmaita" oedipus@hicom.net

unquote i am loathe to let my (and others') cynical opinion of human nature lead me to the ironclad conclusion that the "default" reaction to minimal requirements will be to use them as a lazyman's loophole... so, while i agree that there is a very real danger inherent in the concept of explicitly stating a minimal satisfactory implementation of a checkpoint, that isn't what is under discussion... what the "at a minimum" clauses are intended to provide is a description of the absolute base functionality required by the checkpoint, and realpolitik dictates that the dangers of not explictly outlining base functionality for a checkpoint far outweigh the dangers of either providing a loophole for lazy developers by forcing them, at the very least, to provide well-defined functionality... minimal requirements don't dictate the implementation details of the required functionality -- they merely define what base functionality MUST be available to the user... moreover, when WAI guidelines (such as the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) do not contain explicit requirements for minimally satisfying a checkpoint, the working groups have received requests from developers, claiming that the affiliated Techniques documents, due to their informative/non-normative status, cannot sufficiently address what is minimally required to satisfy a particular checkpoint... so, while i share your concern about the potential straitjacketing effect normative minimal requirements may have upon developers, there is also a clear need to define normatively what exactly constitutes minimal satisfaction of the checkpoint in question, as well as the need for providing context for the checkpoint... for example, what use would it be to simply state that a user agent MUST offer a search facility, if the basic parameters for a search facility aren't explicitly stated? the ability to search is the absolute minimum, but the ability to search is quite an amorphous concept, so the base functionality necessary for a UAAG conformance claim is spelled out explictly in the User Agent Guidelines [reference 1] as for your last point, quote Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution?

implemented. 
Only guidelines should  use "at minimum". 
When you said "guidelines or sub text" Heather, did you mean to say ATAG or the techniques or both? 
I've found at IBM that I do in fact have to suggest "at a minimum" also for techniques, using phrases like: at a minimum one or more of the following techniques need to be implemented to meet the accessibility standard for x y z. 
Please see examples in the IBM Hardware Accessibility checklist at software and web will be up on the site soon as well. 
I do NOT recommend this for ATAG, it's IBM, 508, and others that get to decide what part of the W3C standard that they want to "at a minimum" implement. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins IBM Research Division - Accessibility Center 
I think that the Working group does need to specify what "at a minimum" can satisfy the requirements of a checkpoint. 
The interpretation done by other organisations to meet further needs of theirs is additional to the requirements which this working group addresses in our own work.

I have added responses to each of the issues raised, becuase I think this is an important discussion. 
I am still in favour of including some statement of minimum requirements in most checkpoints, although I think there are valid concerns raised about what those should contain and say... cheers (my comments interspersed - all paras start "CMN") Charles With regard to the proposed changes for ATAG v2.

CMN There are two issues here. 
One is lowering the bar - I like the way that some of these proposed texts have "...more useful tools will..." stuff as well. 
CMN The second issue is about interpretation of the guidelines. 
There is no company or product group that knows better than the working group what the working group was trying to achieve in a particular part of the specification. 
It is our job to make it as clear as possible what we meant, and specifying what needs to be done, and what is just something that better products might offer. 
A product group, or policy group, or whoever, then have the best information we can give them, along with the other information they use which is their own expertise. 
*ATAG should not be telling product groups how to implement guidelines. 
The techniques document should be used to show examples of how a range of products met a given guideline. 
CMN Correct. 
*"The minimum" for one product could be something totally different than the WAIs suggestion as the minimum, does that mean it's wrong? 
Even if ATAG doesn't think so, others may. 
CMN I am not so convinced. 
Are you suggesting that in fact there is some it? 
There may be faillings in teh way that we express them - this is why we produce drafts, and ask for review. 
*Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution? 
CMN The minimum requirements should be functional requirements, not particular implementation strategies. 
Any solution that provides teh appropriate functionality meets the "minimum", possibly as well as doing other things.
