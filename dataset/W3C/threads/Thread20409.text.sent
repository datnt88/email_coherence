I downloaded 6.1 a couple of days ago and am just getting to grips with it, however when I select View Source from the menu bar the new window contains an advertisement for Contempt.Productions superimposed on my code, and when I close the window it transfers to the main editing window. 
Can anyone advise what's going on? 
patrick brennan www.patrick-brennan.com - Family History, Javascripts, VBScripts and more Hello Patrick, This behaviour is very surprising because Amaya doesn't interpret any script language. 
I suppose you downloaded a Windows version. 
Could you use an antivirus and try again. 
Thank you Laurent Carcone Amaya Team I use Sophos anti-virus and it is up to date as of today. 
It doesn't report any viruses.
