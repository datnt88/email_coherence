<s> "feedback.gif" width="74" height="28" border="0" alt="[ Feedback ]" vspace= "3" /a /div It seems to break the lines after the = character forcing us to manually or search and replace all the broken sections.  </s>
<s> We have quite a few REAL old documents that have to be converted into html 4.0 standards hence the question here.. G It's allot of work...  </s>

<s> HTML allows you to place line breaks before or after the "=" sign that separates attribute names from values.  </s>
<s> Tidy takes advantage of this to flow the markup within the window width since this reduces the need for horizontal scrolling when editing the markup.  </s>
<s> Tidy has lots of options  </s>
<s> for controlling the formatting, but it can't do everything.  </s>
<s> Tidy works by creating a clean markup tree then pretty  </s>
<s> printing it.  </s>

<s> Yes, but when using older Unix tools like grep or sed, it makes things a LOT easier to have the entire marker, including all its attributes, on one line.  </s>
<s> There are also plenty of editors that will wrap the line for you without actually inserting a line-break (Emacs for example).  </s>
<s> I asked for this option a few weeks ago and it is gratifying to see that I am not the only one who would find it useful.  </s>

<s> Originally, this was done in effect by "slide%d.html";  </s>
<s> now it is done by "slide%0*d.html", slide_min_digits, because it is more convenient for wild-card file naming if all the file names have the same length.  </s>
<s> The original behaviour can be restored by setting slide_min_digits to 1. Most unfortunately, the naming convention is not encapsulated in a single function.  </s>
<s> Next time this is visted, refactor.  </s>

<s> From the HTML Tidy manual: wrap: number Sets the right margin for line wrapping.  </s>
<s> Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length.  </s>
<s> The default is 66. Set wrap to zero if you do not want line wrapping.  </s>

<s> Hey Erik, not sure if it helps you or not, but I just set the line wrap to 1000 and it does leave the text alone, at least those under 1000.. G  </s>
<s> Yeah, I've done that too, but it can be a bit of a pain if you have paragraphs that are of a reasonable size, i.e. larger than screen width.  </s>
<s> All I want is for my IMG , A , and META tags to stay on one line (so I can CTRL-K a tag in one go) and everything else to break at 80 columns or so.  </s>
<s> It just seems so logical to me to have the option to treat tags as un-breakable units... Erik Rossen ^ rossen@freesurf.ch  </s>
