E&amp;R TELECONFERENCE Date: 9 August 1999 MIT Bridge +1 617 258 7910 Chris Ridpath, chair Gregory J. Rosmaita, scribe present: Michael Cooper, CAST (MC) Brian Matheny, CAST (BM) Chris Ridpath, U Toronto (CR) Gregory Rosmaita, VICUG NYC (GJR) scribe's note: CR was first on the call; GJR then joined, after calling the wrong bridge; a few minutes later, both BM &amp; MC joined; after a five minute wait, during which there was some general discussion of work-in-progress, it was mutually decided that a more formal discussion of the work that CR, BM, and MC have been performing should be fully documented by GJR, in the hope that minutes posted to the ER list(s) would spur others into commenting upon the revised document, as well as specific techniques; MC: CAST is currently renaming and re-editing Bobby's language CR: is the language carved in stone? 
MC: (laughs) no-it is an XML file! 
GJR: could you post current language to list? 
MC: I was going to post to the list, but didn't know if it was ripe enough yet for discussion; I have a shortened version--just the hierarchy-but am getting closer to an implementation document, which I will post to the list if others want me to do so CR: I think it would be helpful to have a look at it BM: is there an agenda for this meeting? 
GJR: not that I am aware of, but since MC began detailing his work, I've been taking notes, so why don't we just continue this discussion, see what issues we can resolve and what plans of action we can come up with, and then see what reaction the other members have CR: sounds fine to me. 
let me comment upon the status of my document-I have updated the implementation document with a new structure that breaks the process into evaluation, suggested language, and repair techniques; overall, it makes it much easier to read; maybe could start off with a couple of issues that could be easily resolved MC: don't remember which CR: there are 2 in particular: 1) notify user that complex images need LONGDESC; 2) notify user that it is necessary to identify the primary natural language of the document MC: second shouldn't be contentious; make sure there is a LANG attribute in the HTML tag; there is the possibility of addressing the extra stuff that might be obtained via content negotiation, but I'm not sure if that process is within our scope - an ER program may not be able to detect it; perhaps we could add something in the techniques about checking it as a manual item: "if possible, use content negotiation" GJR: CR, has anyone contacted you about hosting your work-in- progress in W3C webspace? 
there was some discussion of it during the 28 July AU WG telecon CR: well, I thought I'd keep at UToronto until it gets farther along, but I wouldn't mind at all if it was hosted, or at least mirrored, in W3C space GJR: will send minutes from 28 July AU telecon to CR - should talk to Len, Daniel, or Charles McCathieNevile about moving document to W3C space CR: ok-I'd like to take a look at the AU minutes // scribe's note: minutes of the 28 July AU telecon can be found at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-28jul99 CR: getting back to the LANG attribute, should we post to list, stating that this is what we want to do? 
MC: should make post as filled-out as we can CR: let's discuss prompting the user to add LONGDESC MC: how do we determine whether the image needs a LONGDESC? 
CR: I think we need to prompt for a LONGDESC for every image that isn't a bullet or rule MC: would it be possible to have user input size info to program-for example, this is an icon that doesn't need a LONGDESC CR: well, the ER tool should only ask the first time it encounters the image, then ignore-it's only a nuisance once, then! 
if image has already been found and user has chosen not to add LONGDESC, would not be prompted again BM: same for a lot of other options CR: so, need an automated check of the document--if uses LONGDESC once, should recycle it? 
GJR: depends upon the use of the image and the implementation of LONGDESC by UAs-it may be necessary or desirable to have a LONGDESC associated with an image once, say to describe the seal of a university, and then not again, although that is dependent upon the action of the UA-I may not want a lot of excess verbiage being thrown at me if I don't care what the image is, and merely hearing the word "LONGDESC" or "Long Description of Graphic" over and over most definitely falls into the "annoying" category-need to ensure have that I as the user have control over the timing and nature of the LONGDESC display, which points out dependencies to both the UA and AU GLs. 
I can also conceptualize situations in which an author might use different LONGDESCs for the same image-for example, if the image recurs on a page which has a different natural language declaration, LONGDESC URI should point to a long description in the second language, etc. CR: seems to me that ALT text could be different, but description of image itself should be unvarying MC: at CAST believe that the description of an image is dependent upon the context in which it is being used; don't necessarily want same description for every instance of image-shouldn't always force to same URI CR: well, an automatic tool would automatically link to one LONGDESC, unless told otherwise MC: reminds me discussion of ABBR element-HTML4 spec says should only be used first time abbreviation occurs; not sure about LONGDESC; as GJR pointed out, depends upon UA; would default to prompting CR: ok, I can do that CR: next item I want to discuss is whether or not we can come up with a list of criteria that automatically informs the ER tool what images are being used as a bullet and what images are being used as rule; haven't done any studies of it, but figure if larger than 20x20, then I would argue that the ER tool should not consider it a bullet MC: good general rule; if bigger than 20 pixels, starting to get to icon size; windows standard for an icon is 36 pixels square; 20 is over half that-actually, pretty big CR: should we start at 20 pix and see who complains MC, BM, and GJR: agree CR: what about images being used as substitutes for HR? MC: I'd propose that 10 pixels be the max height for a rule; what do others think? 
BM: seen a few over 10 pix high CR: we have a student intern who could go out, look at sites, and see how large they are BM: make sure he looks at a lot of images, and not just rules and bullets-the more data we can gather, the better the document and the resultant tools MC: yes, and we can then come to the ER group and say "this rule will apply to images of a certain size" - can consider it part of ALT text discussion - put size info in an appendix; bullet, rule, and icon size is a good starting point CR: old Mac size for an icon, I believe, was 32 square MC: 32 and 36 square an icon, anything smaller probably a bullet or HR; buttons also tend to be a standard size CR: wonder if it is our role to figure these things out-if these are standard sizes, couldn't the browser figure it out? 
if comes across a 36x36 couldn't it tell the user "this is an icon" GJR: but then the user still wouldn't know what the icon symbolizes, what information it contains CR: needs to be done during authoring process, then BM: trying to detect images and say what they are is good, but want to avoid nuisance prompts-only ask the user when necessary CR: does anyone know if this is being addressed by AU WG? // unminuted discussion of AU working group led by GJR, who was too busy flapping his gums to take notes; GJR offered to be liaison between ER and AU groups; will post URI of minutes and working draft to ER list // BM: some of our document's checkpoints are very close to being ready for approval; if a small group of us work on them, we can get them pushed through and jump-start the process of finalizing the document MC: how long a period do we leave for comment after we post something to the list? 
BM: isn't there a legal term for approval by default? 
CR: people are going to be the final test; will ultimately have to revise ER tools based on user feedback BM: yes, but want to minimize amount of revision necessary, both to the tool and the document CR: would like the document to be authoritative BM: hoping that if get things done well, will be easier to modify software based on feedback; document is definitely crystallizing and getting much clearer; overall, I think it is in pretty good shape MC: well, we have 2 items to bring to list; don't see any more offhand that could go, but do see a couple that might be able to get there quickly; should ID those to bring to list CR: OK - I was thinking BLINK or MARQUEE should not be used is ready MC: should be a separate technique for each; think checkpoints that fall under each - avoid BLINK under 7.2 Marquee under 7.3 with note that need supplemental technique to cover movement ; 7.1.A would be split and moved to 7.2 and 7.3 CR: will you email me your comments? 
MC: yes CR: I'm concerned about the passivity of the suggested language - "if missing ALT text." 
rather than "ALT text is required for this image." 
- only implies that is missing, is that better than - "You need ALT text-put some in" GJR: get better response if you tell them "you need" or "you must", rather than "something is missing" or "you should" CR: who is going to figure out best way of doing it? 
MC: the ER tool developers will have to be the lead on that; we have a couple of other people at CAST, such as Sonja, who could give feedback; want to make wording consistent over techniques; passive voice approach not good anyway; would it be helpful if we take another pass at it and pass along comments to you? 
CR: yes, definitely! 
MC: agreed that approach want to take is geared towards maximum user-friendliness and clarity CR: yeah; also want to bring up something based on a comment made at the last meeting about having more than one mode-advanced and beginner; should the suggested language be different for each? 
MC: basic language and error messages should be the same; extended explanation would be different-more detailed for advanced; if even some of these things are truly only understandable in expert mode (someone who understands HTML source), how should we approach explanation; for example, using lists to create indent-if someone doesn't know HTML they won't have any basis for understanding the explanation; this is going to be the problem with the higher level checkpoints-they are problematic from an explanatory point- of-view CR: we could prepare a list; should also address device independent functions, etc. BM: need to be more in touch with AU tool users to find out what would work for them-after all, that's why most of them use an AU tool--so that they don't have to learn the markup languages MC: on BOBBY list get email all the time about ALT text-have standard responses; one of the commonest questions is: "FrontPage strips ALT text from my imagemap, and so I can't get my page/site BOBBY approved--what do I do? 
we suggest they contact Microsoft, and, if they feel confident doing it, editing the document source by hand in a plain text editor GJR: this is an issue that is addressed in AU GLs under such checkpoints as: use W3C recs, don't remove any markup known to promote accessibility; when encountering markup that the AU tool doesn't recognize, do not remove without first prompting the author; etc. - would recommend that the ER group check the AU GL working draft // unminuted discussion of developer participation in AU WG and receptiveness of developers to AU working drafts; again, reason for no minutes is that scribe was leading discussion and responding to questions posed by others on the call // MC: that gives us some guidance in what we are doing; we should all keep up on the AU's work CR: before next call, should we go to list with MARQUEE and BLINK? 
GJR: yes; with posting of minutes and specifics to list, we are providing ER members with the opportunity to approach the document from 2 levels-the meta level and the detailed level, and hopefully, we can get feedback on both MC: if posting to list, how can we demarcate what is a request for review, and what is a request for approval? 
BM: could vary subject line-APPROVAL REQUEST and REVIEW REQUEST in caps MC: will anyone respect them-or, rather, know what they mean and respond accordingly? 
GJR: if they read the minutes, they will! 
and, we'll have the added benefit of discovering who actually reads the minutes! 
MC: ok-CR, lets you and BM and me work offline to get a short list of things that can be addressed quickly together CR: when come up with short list, put it out on mailing list MC: will do CR: are we finished? 
BM: well, we're pretty much through our non-existent agenda!

Sorry formissing the call. 
I'm in vacation this week, and I should have sent regrets to the list. 
I've placed an updated version of the 'techniques' document at: This document includes the intro by William and the new format suggested by Daniel. 
I hope it's now a bit easier to read. 
As we discussed in the Aug. 9 teleconference, I'm proposing 2 techniques for discussion that we should be able to all reach agreement on. 
The first technique, 1.1.B, deals with LONGDESC for images. 
The second technique, 4.3.A, 
deals with the primary language of the document. 
If you have any comments or suggestions on these techniques, please voice them soon. 
I'm hoping that we can reach agreement within a week on these 2 techniques. 
I'll start up a discussion on the BLINK/MARQUEE techniques in a couple of days. 
Chris
