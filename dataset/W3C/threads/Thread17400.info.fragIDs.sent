<s> What about opening a help window?  </s>
<s> Is it possible for a browser to detect the use of a screen reader?  </s>
<s> Or other assistive technology?  </s>
<s> If it could, wouldn't it make life easier for designers?  </s>
<s> An alternative text description of such things as help windows (or complex images like maps) could be sent to the screen reader in place of the object.  </s>
<s> Could Javascript be used to open a help window, or, alternatively, send some text to the screen reader if one is detected?  </s>

<s> PS :: Coincidence?  </s>
<s> Have been looking at Atutor today and forwarded information to a friend.  </s>
<s> Not that we are aware of (except maybe HPR).  </s>
<s> We generally avoid using browser detectors, and make sites universal to begin with.  </s>
<s> An AT detector would be nice though.  </s>
<s> greg  </s>
<s> Greg it should not be necessary, the whole point is that AT users get the same information as a sighted/'normal' user, which can be accomplished using the existing guidelines.  </s>
<s> Out of curiosity I have noticed netscape mentioned a few times, does anyone actually still use that?  </s>
<s> Personally I only check pages in IE (yeuch) Opera (bleh) and Mozilla Firebird (yay) - ok I am a little biased :-P David  </s>
<s> I totally agree that both AT user and others should receive the same information.  </s>
<s> But that does not mean I can't present that information in two different interfaces.  </s>
<s> An AT detector would be great for this purpose.  </s>
<s> There is no reason why I can not present my information to you in an all text format, with text navigation etc, if you are using a screen reader, and present it in a graphic rich format if you are a person who prefers a visual display.  </s>
<s> I'm not talking browser detector BTW.  </s>
<s> We never browser detect, but AT detecting could be very useful, for applying preference settings for example.  </s>
<s> See the IMS ACCLIP specifications, or the preset accessibility settings in ATutor, for example .  </s>
<s> Same information, different interface element depending on how the reader prefers information to be presented.  </s>
<s> greg  </s>
<s> Uhmm... how about this thing called CSS?  </s>
<s> Separate function/information from display... Re: AT detecting.  </s>
<s> Most "generalized" AT applications operate at the OS level.  </s>
<s> JAWS (and I believe Window Eyes) use Internet Explorer for web access, even Homepage Reader uses the IE rendering agent.  </s>
<s> How would you detect somebody using a braille output device?  </s>
<s> Then there is the whole mobility impairment side... how exactly do you propose "testing" for somebody using "sip and puff" tools, or voice recognition software?  </s>
<s> (I know of a quadriplegic who exclusively uses Dragon Dictate/Dragon Naturally Speaking).  </s>
<s> Nope, Universal Accessibility should not depend on alternate streams... you're heading into a mess of tangled pages when you go down that road... JF John Foliot foliot@wats.ca  </s>

<s> Are you suggesting that CSS should be used to determine the UA behaviour when certain links are activated ?  </s>
