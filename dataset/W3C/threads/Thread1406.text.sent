This is probably just a nitpick, but the ASCII version of the current draft at ietf.org has an expiration date of January 3, 2001, even though it wasn't written until July 3 2001. 
-Mark Thanks Mark, that should be "January 3, 2002". 
Geoff's mail auto responder tells me that he is on vacation this week (and he took the editor's token with him g ); so keep these corrections coming and expect to see a refresh draft sometime shortly after his return. 
Regards, Tim Thanks! 
No error is too minor or nitpicky to be worth fixing.
