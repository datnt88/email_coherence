<s> Digest of Response (September 9, 1996) ADA Accessibility Requirements Apply to Internet Web Pages Entities to Title II or III of the ADA must provide effective communication to individuals with disabilities, and covered entities that use the Internet to provide information regarding their programs, goods or services must be prepared to offer those communications through accessible means.  </s>
<s> Such entities may provide web page information in text format that is accessible to screen reading devices that are used by people with visual impairments, and they may also offer alternative accessible formats that are identified in a screen-readable format on a web page.  </s>
<s> Text of Inquiry I have recently been contacted by one of my constituents who has a concern over the administration's policy on making Web pages compatible for the disabled.  </s>
<s> I respectfully ask you to review the administration's policy on this issue and send me a clarification so that I might be able to respond to my constituent's questions.  </s>
<s> It would be helpful if you could mark your correspondence with my office to the attention of Laura Stuber.  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your assistance on this matter.  </s>
<s> Text of Response I am responding to your letter on behalf of your constituent, [], regarding accessibility of "web pages" on the Internet to people with visual disabilities.  </s>
<s> The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and local governments and places of public accommodation to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effect communication with individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the program or service or in an undue burden.  </s>
<s> 28 C.F.R. Sec.  </s>
<s> 36.303; 28 C.F.R. Sec.  </s>
<s> 35.160.  </s>
<s> Auxiliary aids include taped texts, Brailled materials, large print materials, and other methods of making visually delivered material available to people with visual impairments.  </s>
<s> Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide effective communication, regardless of whether they generally communicate through print media, audio media, or computerized media such as the Internet.  </s>
<s> Covered entities that use the Internet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or services must be prepared to offer those communications through accessible means as well.  </s>
<s> Mr. [] suggests compatibility with the Lynx browser as a means of assuring accessibility of the Internet.  </s>
<s> Lynx is, however, only one of many available options.  </s>
<s> Other examples include providing the web page information in text format, rather then exclusively in graphic format.  </s>
<s> Such text is accessible to screen reading devices used by people with visual impairments.  </s>
<s> Instead of providing full accessibility through the Internet directly, covered entities may also offer other alternate accessible formats, such as Braille, large print, and/or audio materials, to communicate the information contained in web pages to people with visual impairments.  </s>
<s> The availability of such materials should be noted in a text (i.e., screen-readable) format on the web page, along with instructions for obtaining the materials, so that people with disabilities using the Internet will know how to obtain the accessible formats.  </s>

<s> sc. young-parran The Internet is an excellent source of information and, of course, people with disabilities should have access to it as effectively as people without disabilities.  </s>
<s> A number of web sites provide information about accessibility of web pages, including information about new developments and guidelines for development of accessible web pages.  </s>
<s> Examples include: Center for Information Technology Accommodation General Services Administration Trace Center, University of Wisconsin These sites may be useful to you or your constituent in exploring the accessibility options on the Internet.  </s>
<s> In addition, the Department of Justice has established an ADA home page to educate people about their rights and responsibilities under the ADA and about the Department's efforts to implement the ADA.  </s>
<s> The address of the ADA home page is I hope this information is helpful to you in responding to your constituent.  </s>

<s> All, I think both need to be done.  </s>
<s> If everyone was ethical and responsible there would be no need for the ADA in the first place, and people with disabilities would not have the horrendous unemployment rate that they do.  </s>
<s> Such a site with the laws would be useful.  </s>
<s> It will also be difficult to put  </s>

<s> Hi, Can WAI establish a web site for legal information concerning web accessibility?  </s>
<s> It be great to have a one-stop shopping center.  </s>
<s> It would need to be broken down by country.  </s>
<s> JW:: I understand that in the early stages of the WAI, a project of this kind was attempted, but that reliable information was not readily obtainable.  </s>
<s> I think there is definitely scope for such a site.  </s>
<s> However, the primary task of the WAI educational effort should be to persuade authors and software developers to adopt universal design strategies out of a sense of justice and responsibility, rather than to raise the threat of legal liability.  </s>
<s> It is preferable to appeal to the high ethical standards and integrity of web content providers and software developers than to base one's argument on the provisions of antidiscrimination law.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, it may be useful to provide information concerning the relevance of anti-discrimination laws in different countries to the provision of web-based documents and services.  </s>
<s> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia has already done so by releasing a discussion paper, a reference to which is included in the WAI page author guidelines.  </s>
<s> For those in the United States, I also agree that it would be helpful to compile US civil rights laws and regulations that impact the evolution of the internet.  </s>
<s> Technology is rapidly redefining the way we work and play in our world and so I believe the public policy of equal access will continue to play a significant role.  </s>
<s> Laws, however, can be restrictive and that is why I support the application of Universal Design principles for web design since they bring broad economic and social benefits beyond those just for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Some of our laws of interest include: Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Sections 501, 503, 504 &amp; 508) Telecommunications Act of 1996 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act State Laws &amp; Policies It also has been interested to follow case law developments and various settlement agreements that are not published.  </s>
<s> One area of particular interest has been how the Office of Civil Rights, United States Department of Education, has been enforcing equivalent access to the internet at our colleges and universities statewide.  </s>
<s> I briefly discuss this development in my article entitled "Electronic Curbcuts: How to Build an Accessible Web Site" posted at http://www.prodworks.com/ilf/w5bcw.htm  </s>
<s> As legal issues present themselves, I would be glad to post to this list.  </s>
<s> In fact, I am preparing my lecture for a Telecommunications and Technology Law class at Santa Clara University School of Law, and will share any questions/insights raised by these budding attorneys.  </s>
<s> Lastly, I received a request from someone on this list for my bio and it is posted at Webgrrls "Top 25 Women on the Web" of my office in implementing web accessibility at the City of San Jose can be found in an article published by the Silicon Valley Business Journal at Cynthia D.

<s> Hi, I think that such a web site is important.  </s>
<s> Part of my believe is that disabled people need to be self-advocates and such a site would give them some of the necessary tools.  </s>

<s> If still no response, then I go to the stick bin.  </s>

<s> While I agree it is preferable to motivate web developers to voluntarily "do the right thing," I think a multi-pronged strategy is needed in this area as in others.  </s>
