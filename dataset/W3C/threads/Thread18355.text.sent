This is a proposed revision of checkpoint 4.2 based on discussions on the 19 July teleconference[1]. 
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families offered by the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment. 
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families offered by the conventional font dialog box resource supported by the operating environment. 
If the operating environment does not offer a conventional font dialog box resource, allow the user to choose any font family supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.

isn't a quote conventional font dialog box unquote a technique? 
i don't think that the proposal is any clearer; nor, upon reflection, do i think that much tweaking is necessary, provided that the 2-step cascade worked out and notated by ian in the minutes from the 19 july 2001 telecon is addressed... the current 4.2 says precisely what you restated, only in a non-techniquey manner -- what i would, then counter-propose is the following: Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families offered by the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment. 
If the operating environment does not include a conventional/direct font dialog selection mechanism, allow the user to choose any font family supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.

families offered  by the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment.  
/CURRENT   NEW  Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families offered  by the conventional font dialog box resource supported by the operating  environment. 
If the operating environment does not offer a conventional  font dialog box resource, allow the user to choose any font family  supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.  
/NEW Gregory, On the call yesterday people seemed to want to use the phrase dialog box in the requirements, since that is terminology that is more familiar to developers. 
I add the word "resource" to emphasize the part of the operating system environment user interface a user would expect from an application for font and or color selection. 
The proposed wording doesn't require you to use the font dialog box resource, but only that you provide the same capabilities as found in the operating system resource. 
Maybe that needs to be made clearer. 
What do people think about "font/color dialog box resource" or "conventional font/color selection mechanism"?
