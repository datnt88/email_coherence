Liz has a design for the SWAD-Europe tshirts and will be on irc 
(irc.freenode.net 
#rdfig) at 11 GMT today to present it and chat about 
it, if you're interested. 
cheers Libby 
sorry I missed that :( I had a look to the #rdfig weblog - the design looks cool and nice color too :) well done! 
just a small comment on the back side of the t-shirt: 
the Italian phrasing should more correctly be instead: "e tutto quello che abbiamo ottenuto e' questa stupida maglietta" or you can use t-shirt instead of "maglietta" which is fine too cheers Alberto 
I want two. 
no matter what is printed on the back. 
I wasn't there but we (SemWeb guys) are desperate to "show flag" about SemWeb brains here in vienna ! 
hope you can get them to us somehow :-) greetings Leo &amp; Michi we paypal
