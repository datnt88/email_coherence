I have now worked through the last call issue resolutions and the editors draft of concepts should be up-to-date. 
I need to review it, and I hope Graham will join me in so doing at this stage. 
I will prepare a further resolution concerning XMLLiterals for Friday: since the text in the editors draft does not correspond with WG resolutions. 
Jeremy I have now completed my own review, and updated the document accordingly. 
The most significant omission was williams-02 Jeremy Oh bl**dy marvelous!!! 
This is very encouraging. 
Brian I have now republished with changes from Graham and Pat. 
I think the current version is ready for WG review, although if Graham gets me any further changes before the telecon tomorrow I will include them. 
I list the latest changes below (the very last one is possibly the most interesting, concerning synonyms for XMLLiteral). 
Patrick: "The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes..." Pat on datatypes: That reads OK to me also as a first sentence, although you might want to qualify it pretty quickly since we explicitly rule out some of the XMLS datatypes as being incompatible. 
I now have " ... is compatible with the abstraction used in XML Schema ..." I also explicitly say at end "[RDF-SEMANTICS] contains a more detailed discussion of specific XML Schema built-in datatypes." 
If Pat could provide an anchor on the table of XSD datatypes then I would link directly to that. 
gk: I agree. 
But I think the following: A URI reference or literal used as a node identifies what that node represents. 
A URI reference used as a predicate identifies the relationship between the nodes it connects. 
A predicate URI reference may also be a node in the graph. 
should be revised to say something like "... identifies the relationship between the things represented by the nodes it connects" I did this and also changed from "the relationship" to "a relationship" jeremy concerning semantics: The new text is: "A datatype is identified by one or more URI references" which excludes a free floating datatype with no URI but makes no unique names assumption. 
I beleive this agrees with semantics. 
The new text reads: "A URI reference for identifying this datatype is ..." Brian reminds me: 2002-11-22#5 jjc check that RDF Concepts does not allow a synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral The text above is intended to allow a synonym, without actually saying so explicitly. 
If the WG believes this detail does need explicit text I have a weak preference for it to go in semantics. 
Jeremy Heads-up... 
I'm about 2/3 through my detailed review. 
Generally I think it's looking very good. 
I do have a number of comments, mostly minor and many purely minor editorial, which I plan to submit before the telecon. 
However, I suggest that we treat the 19 June 2003 editors' draft as the basis for any discussions today, rather than chasing a moving target.
