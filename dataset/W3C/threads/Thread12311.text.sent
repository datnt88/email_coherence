A question: Are there any tools available to web authors that will take web page code and make it "accessible" to those with disabilites, such that it meets the W3C requirements? 
Meaning, are there any tools that automate the process of meeting these guidelines? 
Thanks, rich cardillo Rick, The process of converting inaccessible HTML to accessible HTML can't be 100% automated. 
It will require some human intervention to make decisions. 
"A-Prompt" is a tool under development that tries to automate the process as much as possible. 
For more info, check out the A-Prompt site: Regards, Chris and meeting Rich, as well as Aprompt there are other tools which will help an author meet the requirements. 
Some of the requirements are things which cannot be fully automated (for example, a computer is generaly bad at describing the function of an image within a page, or describing a complex image). 
There are authoring tools such as HoTMetaL and HotDog 6.0 that provide support for authors to make content accessible. 
The working group would like to hear of any that you find particularly good, and if possible have reviews of them. 
There sare also a number of authoring tools where it is possible to make content acessible so long as you are aware of the requirements. 
There are unfortunately some where even this is very difficult or impossible.
