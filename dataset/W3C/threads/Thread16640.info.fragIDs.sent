<s> Can anyone on the list help with this discussion?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> No..actually this still doesn't clarify it for me..I read that info  </s>
<s> online, too...which at least helped me to guess that 1.4 referred to syncying.  </s>
<s> But what I still don't understand..text equivalents INCLUDE  </s>
<s> auditory descriptions...SO how does including auditory descriptions help when the priority states that some user agents can't read them automatically?  </s>
<s> And what are they referring to when they talk about text equivalents if not auditory descriptions?  </s>
<s> And if user agents don't automatically read them, how does adding additional text equivalents solve anything?  </s>
<s> And Why would you need an additional priority to tell you that these auditory descriptions need to be in sync?  </s>
<s> In my mind, 1.3 is still trying to say something different..and I don't really know what... snip  </s>
<s> 1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a visual track, provide an auditory description of the important information of the visual track of a multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Synchronize the auditory description with the audio track as per checkpoint 1.4.  </s>
<s> Refer to checkpoint 1.1 for information about textual equivalents for visual information.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 1.3 1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 1.4 this helped clarify for me.  </s>
<s> as you mentioned, why wouldn't you synchronize...seems like some browsers/screen readers may not be able to automatically read these synchronized descriptions.  </s>

<s> Dear Alice, Your message prompted me to notice that the WCAG glossary does not define either "auditory description" nor "textual equivalents".  </s>
<s> Clearly this is an oversight.  </s>
<s> Textual equivalent (in the context of this discussion) means the transcript of an audio (or video) presentation.  </s>
<s> In many cases, especially dramatic presentations, textual equivalence is more than just the words which are spoken, and does need to be fairly descriptive.  </s>
<s> The term "audio description" is something quite different, has nothing to do with text, and has a specific meaning.  </s>
<s> Audio description is a technique of incorporating additional spoken narrative on a movie's sound track.  </s>
<s> By definition then, audio description IS in time with the presentation, so keeping it synchronized is NOT an  </s>
<s> issue.  </s>
<s> For a web example, you might take a look at URL: http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/access/dvs/dvsclip.html (which also includes the  </s>
<s> textual equivalent).  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.3 reads as it does because there is still no technology would allow text (in any form) to be exposed to a screen reader in time with a multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> Since there is not a way for an end user to create dynamic audio description (using speech synthesis and a textual equivalent), 1.3 is basically a requirement for content providers to offer a sound track incorporating audio description whenever they post multimedia.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.4 refers really just to captioning -- since audio description is synced.  </s>
<s> (Although, I guess, it would be theoretically possible NOT to be synchronized -- but that would be MORE work!  </s>
<s> There are plenty of examples of bad or poorly done audio description.  </s>
<s> But, just as there are plenty of example of badly done web pages, that is not a WCAG checkpoint violation!) Cheers, Bruce Bailey  </s>
