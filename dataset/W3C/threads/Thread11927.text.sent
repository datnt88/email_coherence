I believe I can participate. 
That would be 5:00 my time here. 
I have a faculty meeting that may still be running at that time. 
If so I will have to join late. 
How long will the meeting run?

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@tracecenter.org We have scheduled an AU conference call to occur 8:00am Saturday morning Australia time, or 6:00 pm Friday evening EST. 
Unfortunately I have not been able to access my email box remotely since Thursday of last week because it is too big. 
Could those of you who are able to join us by phone for the conference call post a confirmation to the au list. 
I will post the phone number to call (it will be a Boston number) to the list well before the call. 
Please send your confirmations prior to noon Friday EST. 
Thanks and we hope you can join us virtually here in Australia. 
The conference is going well, there is a large turnout for all the WAI events, and some fairly lively debates. 
The weather however has been either 90 degrees with 95% humidity or raining. 
Jutta A little short of two hours.
