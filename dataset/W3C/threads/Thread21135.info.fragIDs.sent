Hi, I am not sure what causes this crash, but it consistently happens as soon as the page has finished loading (Amaya 7.1 on Mac OS 10.2) There are a few "nobr" elements in the page but that is the only validity error I could find.

Chaals, 
as I owe you a few, and i had a moment there is a line: which is not in a table , it is roughly one third of the way down, line 69 according to validator.w3.org. 
remove this line and the page opens OK, it no longer looks great however. 
best wishes Jonathan 
Chaals, 
This may be a separate issue, who knows, but I've set up a crash test here: http://www.peepo.com/w3/crash.html can't seem to get it any smaller, without it displaying :-? 
This validates fine at W3, however I am getting 500 messages on any ideas?

This crash is now fixed in the CVS version. 
It will be available in the next 7.2 public release by end of the week.
