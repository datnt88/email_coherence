All the best Lisa Seeman Visit us at the UB Access website UB Access - Moving internet accessibility Lisa, At last week's teleconference, Gregg said that the meeting will be Saturday afternoon and Sunday after the conference. 
I'm not sure exactly what time things will end on Sunday.

Loretta I already bought my ticket based on dates we've discussed. 
But, my trip cannot be approved by my employer until I receive a formal notification from WAI - I assume that's coming based on prior information. 
I will be out of town until I see you all in LA as of this coming Monday. 
If I have no internet access (which may be the case) in the next few weeks, can someone else from my office check my e-mail and sign up for me?

I will fill in the agenda, link to registration page, and meeting room information once I have those details. 
Will this count for "formal notification" for your employer or do you need something else?
