Could the tabbing among different kind of elements be defined similar to a "find" and "find next" dialog box (in accessible way). 
In addition to the text string, the user could select which element types are searched e.g. header, table, paragraph, table cell, a named element. 
The user could then define some of the most useful searches to be in a separate list easily available to users e.g. when alt tab is pressed. 
Can this be done in an easily accessible way? 
Marja What you describe is the systematic, structured programming way to describe the capability. 
Find [next] instance matching pattern . 
Where pattern includes both content and context qualifiers (context includes HTML element names and attribute values, c.f. selectors in CSS). 
Have you played with the Lynx functions? 
They are pretty simple but there is some adjustment of what class of elements is numbered, and then there is both incremental and absolute motion within that class. 
[Incremental motion over a default class even when nothing is numbered] This is of enough interest so that this functionality is still growing. 
Al Given the dubious success in making forms slick for all, access to query formulation is a research topic IMHO. 
Doable, but we don't know how to articulate how to do it. 
Al To be as intuitive as possible, you might have a generic "Find the next like this" command that worked for all types of markup. 
If the point-of-regard were on a Header1, it would find the next Header1, if on a form control, it would find the next form control, if on a table, it would find the next table. 
This is an implementation question, but could be a fairly cool feature to have in a browser!

Marja This could be done by extending the number of options available in a search. 
DIfferent UA's have different interface techniques, but for most of them it should be fairly obvious how to do it accessibly.
