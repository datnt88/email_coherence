<s> I think that the rules for RS/RE processing in SGML are confusing.  </s>
<s> I prefer Dan Connolly's "phase-of-the-moon" characterisation, myself:-)  </s>
<s> I'd like to make sure that they are _never_ invoked.  </s>
<s> Aside the (religious) issue of 8879-compliance, can anybody explain why they are necessary?  </s>
<s> For instance, exactly what are RS and RE in a byte stream over TCP?  </s>
<s> Sorry, RS/RE has "fuddy-duddy" written all over it (can you say "punch card is all I grok"?)  </s>
<s> The basic problem has always been to allow relatively "free-form" markup, mainly for neatness and readability.  </s>
<s> If RS/RE had really been an issue (as opposed to grandfathering ante-diluvian kludgery) the solution was to allow only *one tag per record*, at the beginning (modulo leading WS?): this would have given relevant if not functional meaning to the term "record".  </s>
<s> But all we have now is a bunch of rules just getting in the way.  </s>
<s> May I propose a focus on relevant concepts rather than rules.  </s>
<s> In the context of essentially free-form text and markup, exactly what does a record-end/end-of-line/whatchamacallit mean?  </s>
<s> 1. Is it part of the instance text?  </s>
<s> 2. Is it (processable) markup?  </s>
<s> 3. Is it an artifact of the storage strategy the environment was too brain-dead not to have encapsulated?  </s>
<s> In some ways, #3 is a special case of (in the sense of imposition on) #2.  </s>
<s> And #1 is clearly unworkable.  </s>
<s> So, if we want simple and strong rules (the kind that establish a two-way relation between ease of programming and ease of understanding) the rational approach IMHO is to treat these animals as markup always.  </s>
<s> When needed as instance text, an inline escape mechanism should suffice (how about '\' as MSSCHAR?).  </s>
<s> The problem is reduced to one  </s>
<s> of lexical tokenization, which is where I believe it always belonged.  </s>
<s> Regards, Arjun My thought  </s>
<s> for SGML is that we could assign them codes (in the delcaration) that the entity manager would _never_ see or produce.  </s>
<s> For instance an 8-bit entity manager would assing RS to code 256 and RE to code 257.  </s>
<s> The codes for CR and LF would be declared to be the same class as TAB and SPACE.  </s>
<s> For SGML this fits the letter of the standard, but parsers will currently choke, or assume that a wider character set is in use.  </s>
<s> For XML we can simplify things by just treating LF and CR (well, actually their 10646 equivalents) as whitespace.  </s>
<s> We can simply skip the entire notion of non-significant and significant RS/RE entirely.  </s>

<s> I'd like to make sure that they are _never_ invoked.  </s>
<s> Well, if you want to be SGML-parsable, you want the content of your elements to be the same whether the document is interpreted as SGML or XML.  </s>
<s> You therefore need either to preserve the RS/RE rules, or find a way that they not be invoked.  </s>
<s> Fuddy-duddy or not, the definition in 8879 is a real issue, and gratuitous incompatibility, especially in the matter of what is element content, is a problem we should avoid.  </s>
<s> Funny, I think #1 is clearly correct.  </s>
<s> Treat CR, LF, and their kin as SGML has always treated tab and space (ignored in element content, parsed as data elsewhere).  </s>
<s> We may need to amend stylesheets to allow a stylesheet to  </s>
<s> recognize CR, LF, or CRLF as special formatting in some contexts.  </s>
<s> This would simplify entity management and parsing both.  </s>
<s> It would mean that line-ending convention transformations would no longer be no-ops, as they change the byte stream, but this is not such a bad idea.  </s>
<s> The worst problem would be dealing with old IBM iron.  </s>
<s> You could do OK by a couple of methods, but none of them would be completely natural with the standard tools (as far as my old mainframe memories go, at any rate).  </s>
<s> And you gain character-stream address stability.  </s>
<s> I think that the byte-stream file has won, and we should just treat CR and LF as more whitespace bytes.  </s>
<s> People who are creating "example" or  </s>
<s> "verbatim" tags, just need to use the stylesheet to declare what's up, or leave it to the application to decide which whitespace differences are significant.  </s>
<s> Note that this is how tabs are already treated, and despite a little pain, the world manages to muddle on.  </s>

<s> There's no elsewhere without a DTD: something that tells the parser what "mode" to be in.  </s>
<s> The issue here is lexical tokenization per se.  </s>
<s> Treating these as data will require a lexer to *report* a different sequence of tokens for foo bar blah as opposed to bar blah which would defeat the purpose of freeform in markup entirely.  </s>
<s> OTOH, my intuitive view of what "freeform" means is that all whitespace between tags should not be significant *unless explicitly indicated*.  </s>
<s> (There's also an issue of leading and trailing ws in data that I elide just now.) Since most of the time such whitespace will be a &amp;newline-indicator;, it makes sense to treat them as markup, apply a canonical rule that transforms it to ws, and then apply some commonsense rules regarding whitespace.  </s>
<s> Agreed, whole-heartedly.  </s>
<s> So the point is to have simple and strong treatment of "free-standing" whitespace -- between tags, before and after text data.  </s>
<s> (I'm sorta coming around to the view that all whitespace is better viewed as markup rather than data:-)) But how all this interacts with RS/RE gotchas and the mixed content problem I confess I'm still confused.  </s>
<s> (SGML is the only system I've seen where innocent cosmetic whitespace could lead one off the Path of Sufficient Virtue.) Regards, Arjun  </s>
