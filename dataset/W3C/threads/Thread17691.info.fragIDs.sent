Here's 7.6 7.6 If a technology allows for more than one caption or description track (e.g., 
caption, auditory description, video of sign language, etc.), allow the user to 
choose from among the tracks. 
What technologies allow for more than one closed caption or video description track?

This was included primarily for Internationalization. Captioning, description languages and signing often times need to be in many languages, so if the document (i.e. a SMIL document) provides choices for captioning langauge, etc... the user agent should support the user being able to 
select the track of their choice. 
I don't know if there are any current players that support multiple captioning tracks, but SMIL specification does support the markup to provide multiple tracks. 
This checkpoint therefore is designed to encourage developers to consider internationalization issues and the effects on disability. 
Supporting multiple languages is an important topic not only within WAI (see 
discussions in the Web Content Group), but an important issues throughout the W3C.

SMIL, longdesc using content-negotiation in HTTP, and I imagine some of the proprietary multimedia technologies too.

Reply to: RE Checkpoint 7.6 The G2 player from Real Networks allows users to specify which language they prefer, which can be evaluated in a SMIL document to choose among text or audio tracks. 
Currently only one language can be indicated which does not permit choosing, for example, English spoken audio with Spanish captions. 
The Quicktime player permits turning on and off any number of tracks individually, which can include audio, video, and text. 
Examples are available from the Web Access Project at NCAM.
