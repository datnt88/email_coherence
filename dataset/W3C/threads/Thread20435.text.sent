When a broken link is right-clicked or double-clicked, could Amaya ask whether you wish to create the document, change the link to the appropriate document, or do nothing.

A 404 Page not found response is a real page (it is only IE that provides its own page for this, removing the possibility for Web servers to provide some site-specific useful information). 
So you can edit this page and save it. 
Alternatively, you can already fix the link - there is no need to have an extra dialogue getting in the way before you do that. 
So I would prefer that this is not changed.

As far as I know, no file system serves a web page. 
It could still show the 404 message in online/browser mode. 
Thanks for replying.

Yes, this is true that there is nothing when working on a file: URI. 
I think in the specific case iof not being able to load a file that it would make sense to either provide, or have an option to provide, a page that says so and can be editied, the same way as a 404 page can be edited.
