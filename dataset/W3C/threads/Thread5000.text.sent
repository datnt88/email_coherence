om FredCo sells a variety of products to consumers and maintains an order tracking database to track customer orders. 
The database is a conventional relational database with a schema normalized for their application Each day, the invoicing program queries the database for orders from the previous day. 
This query is expressed in DAWG-QL (motivating use cases for this choice will follow) and, due to the normalization of the database, joins several tables. 
This use case calls for a mechanism providing RDF access to the bulk of the machine-processable data in use today. 
It bears on the question "how can we match what people use today?" 
Following messages with address "how can we improve corporation's infrastructure?" and "how can we improve consumer experience?" 
It would, of course, be nice if there were no performance sacrifice inherent in using DAWG-QL to perform this query. 
OrderTracking1-alg.sh [1] demonstrates a test case for an application that transforms this somewhat complex graph query into a single somewhat complex SQL query. 
See also, the example tables [2].

Each day, the shipping department packages and address the previous day's orders. 
The address used comes from the shipping address provided with this order but defaults to the customer's billing address if none was provided. 
This use case demonstrates a use of optional arcs in DAWG-QL. 
The implementation, OrderTracking4-alg.sh [1], demonstrates translating these to outer joins in SQL.

The sales department can store additional data not currently allowed for in the relational schema. 
This out-of-relation data is stored in a generic triple store next to the normalized relations. 
Because this is stored with more structure than a "notes" field, queries can be constructed to make good use of this data (imagine if google stored triples). 
This allows the organization to fluidly adapt to needs to express different kinds of data. 
This use case demonstrates joining a conventional relational store against a generic triple store to resolve a query expressed in DAWG-QL [1]. 
Another exmaple [2] demonstrates out-of-relation data being stored in the generic triple store. 
The latter would count as update but it is useful to see that the data could come from somewhere without sales people entering triples into the database by hand.

A consumer, Chip Thompson, wants to check on the status of his order. 
His money-minding application, QuickWeb, supports a widely adopted schema to track pending orders. 
It communicates a query to The endpoint trivially translates this query into a query that maps to its internal structure (either a graph that corresponds to the actual schema of their database, or a layer on top that is used to insulate the enterprise programs from the implementation details). 
The endpoint executes the query, re-maps the results to the outside schema before giving them back to QuickWeb. 
Chip plans to attend a party to show off the item which has just been shippedq. 
Sorry, no specific implementation on this one.
