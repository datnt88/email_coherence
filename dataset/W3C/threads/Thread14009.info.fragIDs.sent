A technique for ensuring that multimedia embedded in a page degrades gracefully. 
Use the EMBED proprietary element within the content of an OBJECT, and associated with aprropriate descriptive text. 
Note that EMBED is not a W3C-recognised element, and that there is no mechanism to associate ALT text with it directly (CMcCN:: Can someone with NS3 or IE or something check this?). 
Therefore this technique is only useful to solve a legacy problem. 
Use of EMBED in other manners actually creates an accessibility problem.

Thus, Charles' proposed kludge amounts to the following: object data="symphony.au" 
Mahler's first symphony embed [attribute referring to symphony.au] 
/object Whereas, a standard-compliant solution would use an anchor element instead of EMBED: a href="symphony.au" 
Listen to Mahler's first symphony /a within the content of OBJECT. 
Of course, some functionality is lost, but the result is not overly inconvenient for the reader and maintains conformity with the HTML specification. 
The legacy will, of course, disappear as users upgrade their software. 
That's about the size of it. 
I think it will be used a lot (EMBED is used a lot) for movies and audio to be included within a page instead of seperately - it's one of those things that I suspect designers are VERY reluctant to give up. 
So I think that offering a good kludge which provides an accessible result is better than leaving people to do as they will. 
Actually it would be worth suggesting that they also include a link to the object in the standard (A HREF) way.
