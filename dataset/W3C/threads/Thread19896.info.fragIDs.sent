<s> Hi, it might be obvious, however, it seems that the menu "special / make book" is not available when the  </s>
<s> documentation has been loaded via the "help"-menu.  </s>
<s> (which seems to be a feature)  </s>
<s> so to make a book from the documentation I had first to load the file via the open dialogue ...  </s>
<s> Maybe this could be mentioned in the docs ;-)  </s>
<s> BTW: "make book" is a very useful :-) roland roland.bauer@fff.at  </s>

<s> Help documents are by default displayed in browser mode (ReadOnly), and you must change the mode if you want to make a book.  </s>
<s> If you select the entry "Show Button Bar" you will have access to the button "Editor/Browser" and could change the mode and make the book.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should open Help documents with the button bar displayed.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> There are many interesting features in Amaya that need to be documented.  </s>
<s> We will very happy is someone could help us to complete the in line documentation.  </s>
<s> Thanks to Charles McCathieNevile who is documenting WAI aspects of Amaya.  </s>

<s> [ Snip make book problem ]  </s>
<s> I assume that "make book" creates a new document based upon the current document's contents, rather than actually modifying the current document.  </s>
<s> In this case, "make book" is a read-only operation, with respect to the current document, and there is no reason for the "make book" operation not to be available in the read-only mode.  </s>
<s> (If it is not the case that a new document is created with this operation, perhaps it should be so).  </s>
<s> Perhaps also the "Edit" menu ought to have a "Toggle write status" option, available at all times.  </s>

<s> I personally would prefer this.  </s>
<s> BTW: It seems to be a little ;-) bug that (in help-files) this button is NOT dimmed when the button bar is set to display=yes: 1) Switching to "display button bar": Edit-Button is active (!), Page is locked (as expected) 2) First click: Edit-Button stays active, Page is editable 3) Second click: Edit-Button gets dimmed, File is read-only However, do you think this behaviour (help files are shown with or without buttonbar etc.) should be configurable?  </s>
<s> Maybe with default = "help files are shown with button bars"?  </s>
<s> I personally like systems where 500 (or more ;-) properties can (!) be configured but (!) the default behaviour is as the "average user" would expect it ;-) Maybe some people will think this to be overkill ... At this point I come to another question: In order not to flood this list with wishes which do not conform to the "philosophy of Amaya", I'd be happy to read such a concept before asking for new features.  </s>
<s> Or have I missed it?  </s>
<s> So I'd first suggest a section in the docs like ...##### TITLE: Feedback If you have suggestions concerning the documentation of Amaya, please send the suggested text-snippets (or wishes/suggestions) to Charles McCathieNevile charles@amaya... .  </s>
<s> Is this the way you like it?  </s>

<s> "make book" changes the current document.  </s>
<s> It's why that command cannot be executed in Read-Only mode.  </s>
<s> One interest is to generate the book to print it.  </s>
<s> Do you suggest to add an entry in the menu "Edit"?  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Yes, that's what I meant.  </s>
<s> One that simply calls the same function as does the Browse/Edit button on the toolbar.  </s>
