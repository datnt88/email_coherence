<s> The latest version of the requirements document is available at: This version looks much different from other versions as Ian was able to boil the requirements down to 5 major sections.  </s>
<s> I believe the structure that Ian created is much easier to read and understand.  </s>
<s> Please think about the following questions as you review: 1. Are all of the ideas from the face2face covered in these documents?  </s>
<s> If not, should they be or is it better to leave some issues out of the requirements document?  </s>
<s> [refer to the minutes: 2. Is there anything that we are describing that is not possible?  </s>
<s> 3. Is anything out of scope?  </s>

<s> Wendy, There was no mention of scripting in the revised requirements document.  </s>
<s> Is scripting considered part of other specifications or is it not going to be in the scope of what the working group is going to work on?  </s>

<s> Jon, I believe the statement "Clearly specify how content that is tailored according to client or user capabilities may conform (dynamic content or database driven)."  </s>
<s> applies to scripting issues.  </s>
<s> This is found in the second section called "Ensure that the minimal conformance requirements are clear" If this does not cover your needs please be more specific.  </s>

<s> The DOM, and its usage in client-side scripts, are explicitly within the working group's scope.  </s>
<s> However, it should be noted that the DOM is intended to be neutral in respect of the script language which is used; our guidelines will probably be the same, as what maters for access purposes is not so much which script langauge is used, but whether the author has taken advantage of the capabilities provided by the DOM.  </s>
<s> Indeed, scripts and applets are equivalent from this perspective (we should perhaps refer to "programmatic objects", as is already done in the guidelines).  </s>
