Given the announcement that W3C has ceased the development of libwww and is transferring all future server work to java based software, what is the position of the amaya developers? 
This information will give an idea of the expected development work with Amaya? 
Thanks Sinclair 
Good question, since we have a good answer :-) The Amaya-1.0 release will occurs today for W3C Members, they will be abble to find the new Amaya version by following the http://www.w3.org/pub/member/Amaya/ URL ... 
This new version is twofold : - it can be conpiled with libWWW as usual. 
This is the estimated "stable" release. 
- it can be compiled with the Kaffe Java interpreter on a subset of the platforms (Linux, solaris, sunOs, linux-sparc) and then uses the Jigsaw client HTTP classes for network accesses. 
This provides a supported HTTP/1.1 network stack, and the long awaited user cache. 
The new Amaya-Java also provides an easy way to extend or cusomize Amaya without requiring a recompilation of the C source code. 
This helps a lot especially for those without Motif libraries. 
Most ot the Thot API is available from the Java language, providing means for "enhanced developements". 
I will present this work at the WWW6 conference next week during the Developer's Day. 
We expect the Kaffe interpreter (in fact it's a JIT compiler) to stabilize on not yet supported platforms. 
Hence the Java based version will become the standard one in the future releases.

Daniel BTW: Thot-2.1 is now available on http://opera.inrialpes.fr/thot/
