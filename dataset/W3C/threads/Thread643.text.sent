Hi. Tidy is reporting and changing, &amp;, in a file name, as an error. 
Regards Robert P. Nederpelt "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master." -- George Washington, speech of January 7, 1790 It's probably correct to do so, but as you haven't provided any details ... What do you mean by "in a file name"? 
In a URL? 
If so, this should be expanded to &amp;amp; in order to conform to HTML spec.
