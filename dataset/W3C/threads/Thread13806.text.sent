There is a new version of the Guidelines Working Draft up on the GL website as before there is a table version and a linear version of the guidelines. 
Table version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806.htm The linear version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806txt.htm This set has incorporated as many of the following as we could (compatibly) cover -comments on the lists -comments made at Peterborough -the results of coordination talks between the chairs of all the guidelines and tool groups We still have a few to work on but wanted to get this out to the list for use, study and comment. 
We will be using this document as a reference document from here forward. 
That is, we will begin logging changes that are made to make it easier to follow. 
So much has happened though that we haven't been able to do that in the past while. 
So give this one a thorough read and we'll reference discussions back to this one. 
Thanks everyone for all the input and hard work.

broken link in http://www.w3.org/wai/gl : instead of (this file also has some bug in it: an missing /A or something, it appears all blue to me) The current issue list doesn't seem up-to-date with the recent thread on reorg of the sections, that's fine, but it would help if the date of "issues gathering" on the list was indicated. 
Hello, I think the guidelines are looking great. 
Here are a few comments. 
The ones marked [Editorial.] 
do not refer to the guidelines as such but rather the prose or organization of the final easier-to-read document. 
0) [Editorial.] 
Some words should be defined, such as: a) "equivalent" (as in what makes two forms of information roughly equivalent) b) "modality" (B.1, Rationale) c) "collate" (A.4, Technique 3) d) "link phrases" (D.5) 1) Rating and Classification - Instead of "implementing" a guideline (presumably with one or more techniques), I suggest using a different expression, including "follow a guidline", "observe a guideline", "respect a guideline", or even "comply with a guideline". 
I like the latter, but realize that it's much stronger language that may scare off some readers. 
- In the paragraph following the priorities: "For Techniques, there may be a number of techniques..." This should be fixed. 
[Editoria.] 
I think that the differences between a guideline and a technique should be more clearly spelled out. 
- [Editorial.] 
In the introduction to the guidelines, a statement should be made that authors should keep in mind that some of their audience is required to override and ignore the intended layout and design of the page. 
Many of the guidelines (those for sense-independence and device-independence) are motivated by that fact. 
2) Section A. - "Provide alternative representations of all non-text information so that a page may be perceived and used without needing to be seen and without needing to be heard." 
[Editorial.] 
Perhaps some explanation should be given about when alternative represenations are and aren't helpful. 
For instance: 1) Text is almost always useful as it may be read or spoken. 
However, even text may confuse a user when it is presented improperly by a UA. 
For instance, tabular text, spaces between words, or ascii art read by a screen reader may lead to confusion. 
2) Sound is useful to describe visual information (images, video, scripts). 
However, sound must be complemented by text. 
3) Images are useful, however (1) they must be complemented by text and possibly sound (2) some people may have difficulty seeing them in some contexts. 
...and so on. 
I'm not sure whether saying something like this steals the thunder of the guidelines or whether it complements them by comparing the alternatives in one place. 
Maybe this could appear instead in a central reference document. 
- Guideline 5. "Use HTML in a way that allows you to provide alternative presentations easily." 
My first reaction to this was "This belongs in the techniques section." 
After a good night's sleep, I have changed my mind (for now!). 
Perhaps what struck me was the word "HTML" in the guideline. 
I think it's the only guideline to refer to HTML explicitly (although some refer to some HTML features). 
I propose removing HTML from the guideline and saying something like: "Design documents that readily lend themselves to alternative presentations." 3) Section B. - Guideline 2: "Use elements and attributes appropriately." 
Define appropriately (e.g., "as specified"). 
4) Section C. - Guideline 2. "Enable keyboard operation of all page elements." 
Why all? 
Does this mean active (links, controls) elements? 
Should be defined. 
- Guideline 3. "Provide interim solutions to facilitate operation ..." "Solutions" strikes me wrong here. 
Instead, I propose echoing the language of A.5 (minus the "HTML" part): "Design documents that are accessible to users with older browsers and assistive technologies." 
5) Section D. - Guidelines D.1 and D.3 are similar. 
Perhaps a more abstract guideline would be: "Group document components into semantic units and clearly label those units." 
Under this guideline, techniques would refer to form controls, lists, and frames. 
I realize that frames may be an important enough subtopic to merit its own guideline. 
- Guideline 5. "Create link phrases that strike a balance between being an accurate description of the link, even when read out of context while at the same time, not being too long." Proposed: "Create link phrases that (1) do not repeat on a page and (2) are meaningful when read out of context and (3) are terse." 
Note: Since the technique for this guideline is the same as the guideline, perhaps the technique should be changed. 
For example, one technique might be to avoid phrases such as "Click here." 6) Section E. - I think E.1 should say more specifically : "Do not use elements or attributes unless they are defined in a W3C Recommendation (HTML 2.0, 3.2, or 4.0)." 
Note the addition of "W3C" and "Recommendation". 
- Proposed guideline: "Avoid deprecated features of a language." 
The HTML 4.0 spec says that authors should avoid deprecated features (as they are likely to be dropped in future versions and with the advent of new technologies). 
That's all for now! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)
