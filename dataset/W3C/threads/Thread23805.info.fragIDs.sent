<s> For text fonts I think Bill is right.  </s>
<s> You need to have a scalable format so that the type works in print as well as on screen.  </s>
<s> The font files are bloated as they have to include either hinting information or bitmap screen fonts.  </s>
<s> I can't see a problem with a format such as TrueType for text, (except getting the same font file to work on multiple platforms) But for display text (anything over HTML font size=7) perhaps a different approach would be more suitable.  </s>
<s> The great thing about using bitmaps for display typography, such as titles and logos, is that you can perform all manner of digital jiggery-pokery on them using Photoshop etc.  </s>
<s> The bad thing is that they don't print out very well.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a vector format like eps should be used... Display typography which is resolution independent, scalable, can be multi coloured and with no complicated copyright issues associated with distributing fonts that can be downloaded and reused elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Adobe could be persuaded to release the rasterizing/ antialiasing routines from PhotoShop for inclusion in browsers.  </s>
<s> Simon Daniels (i-simond@microsoft.com) these views are my own and no not necessarily reflect those of my employer etc.  </s>

<s> Simon Daniels (i-simond@microsoft.com) these views are my own and no not necessarily reflect those of my employer etc.  </s>
<s> I only mentioned Photoshop rasterizing/antialiasing because it's multi-platform and seems to work the same way on all the platforms I've seen (Mac and Windows and SGI).  </s>
<s> Anyway I can't imagine a situation where Adobe would give it away, as it would certainly undermine their Acrobat product.  </s>
<s> Antialiasing in Win95 is far better than Photoshop especially at small sizes.  </s>
<s> But I'm only recommending the approach for display typography, not text set at small sizes, which Photoshop has never been able to deal with (although people still seem to use it.) Searching would still be possible using text included in the ALT tag.  </s>
<s> Although having a comprehensive library of free text faces ( which can also be used for display) seems like a workable idea, designers have an unending appetite for display faces, and I can't see type designers giving thousands of display fonts away for free.  </s>
<s> Using a vector format rendered by the browser seems to sidestep the licensing issues associated with distributing display fonts, because the font can not be extracted and used elsewhere.  </s>

<s> Future versions of Apple's operating system and printers will further integrate and tweak Quickdraw GX. Upcoming OS's will also use Ares Software's Chameleon technology.  </s>
<s> Used in the FontChameleon application, Chameleon automatically generates TrueType and Postscript Type 1 fonts from master outlines and preset descriptor files.  </s>
<s> Combined with Quickdraw GX, Chameleon should offer enhanced document portability, and better font selections and type effects, requiring minimal RAM and disk space.  </s>
<s> The font descriptor files are very small (2-3K).  </s>
<s> Ares is best known for their "FontMonger" PS/TT converter.  </s>
