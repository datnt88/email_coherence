<s> There is a need for (all kinds of )browers to interpret Math language generated by Amaya, but is it now possible to do this?  </s>
<s> Can Amaya browse effects of animated gif or java like other browsers do?  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, Amaya does not currently display animated GIFs - instead it shows only the first frame.  </s>
<s> We could do with someone to add that functionality.  </s>
<s> There does seem to be Java support with Amaya, but I have not tried it  </s>

<s> It is turned off by default and seems to require extra downloads.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I cannot find the amaya-java-src-1.4a.tar.gz on either the EU or US FTP sites.  </s>
<s> There is a file ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/old/amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz available, but I doubt that that will work with the current version of Amaya.  </s>
<s> Perhaps someone other than myself could comment on the Java support in Amaya.  </s>

<s> Not exactly, Amaya-Java is not Java applet support for amaya.  </s>
<s> It's actually an experimental version embedding the Kaffe Java interpreter to extend the capabilities of amaya using Java scripting.  </s>
<s> It also uses the Jigsaw Java HTTP library for network accesses.  </s>
<s> I plan to rebuild a version of Amaya-Java, Kaffe has changed a lot since the last working version of Amaya-Java and it's difficult to guarantee a precise timeframe for the availability of the next Amaya-Java.  </s>

<s> I agree with Ewan answers.  </s>
<s> Just a complement: the amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz is a very old version and is incompatible with the current 1.4a version.  </s>
<s> The integration of a new version of the Kaffe Java virtual machine in Amaya is in progress.  </s>
<s> We hope to be able to release it with a DOM Java interface by the end of the next six months.  </s>
