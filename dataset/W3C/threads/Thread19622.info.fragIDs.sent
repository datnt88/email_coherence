I'm a maths teacher from Hong Kong. 
There is a need for (all kinds of )browers to interpret Math language generated by Amaya, but is it now possible to do this? 
Can Amaya browse effects of animated gif or java like other browsers do? 
Unfortunately, Amaya does not currently display animated GIFs - instead it shows only the first frame. 
We could do with someone to add that functionality. 
There does seem to be Java support with Amaya, but I have not tried it 
yet myself. 
It is turned off by default and seems to require extra downloads. 
Unfortunately, I cannot find the amaya-java-src-1.4a.tar.gz on either the EU or US FTP sites. 
There is a file ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/old/amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz available, but I doubt that that will work with the current version of Amaya. 
Perhaps someone other than myself could comment on the Java support in Amaya. 
Ewan. 
Not exactly, Amaya-Java is not Java applet support for amaya. 
It's actually an experimental version embedding the Kaffe Java interpreter to extend the capabilities of amaya using Java scripting. 
It also uses the Jigsaw Java HTTP library for network accesses. 
I plan to rebuild a version of Amaya-Java, Kaffe has changed a lot since the last working version of Amaya-Java and it's difficult to guarantee a precise timeframe for the availability of the next Amaya-Java. 
I will attempt to rebuild it in the following weeks though, Daniel [Yes, I have moved back to France !] Daniel.Veillard@w3.org | W3C INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Tel : +33 476 615 257 | 655, avenue de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, rpmfind, 
I agree with Ewan answers. 
Just a complement: the amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz is a very old version and is incompatible with the current 1.4a version. 
The integration of a new version of the Kaffe Java virtual machine in Amaya is in progress. 
We hope to be able to release it with a DOM Java interface by the end of the next six months.
