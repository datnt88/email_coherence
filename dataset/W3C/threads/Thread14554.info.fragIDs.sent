<s> Dear Wendy: I can gather some information about Spain and Latin America.  </s>
<s> But for what I have seen the diversity on the use of navigators it is very wide (some names I had never heard them) and I am also certain that in some places and school centers are used old computers with old operative systems.  </s>
<s> So, if what we want is to promote the accessibility for "all", although most uses navigators and potent computers there will always be less favored people for the fortune that we cannot discriminate against.  </s>
<s> As for if the old computers are recycled, the answer is yes, in Spain there are several organizations that recycle and they send the computers to places in those that are very appreciated.  </s>

<s> Asunto: "until user agents?" - revisiting baseline capabilities Message summary: This message grew more the longer I thought about it.  </s>
<s> Reading an article about Netscape 6 from WebReview.com [1] inspired me to compile some statistics on browser usage [3].  </s>
<s> One of the stickiest WCAG 1.0 issues we have is the "until user agents" clause.  </s>
<s> We don't have a clear answer to apply to the WCAG 2.0 working draft yet.  </s>
<s> Here's an attempt to gather some information that might help.  </s>
<s> I have sent this e-mail specifically to several people on the GL list since I've included a list of questions about usage in people's regions or work environments.  </s>
<s> Answers to these questions might help us form a clearer picture of the technology that people with disabilities use and if it is significantly different than the rest of the population.  </s>
<s> --w WebReview published an article last week called, "Why Netscape 6 Woes Are Your Best Friends" [1] by Makiko Itoh.  </s>
<s> In it, he discusses some of the bugs in Netscape 6 but also its conformance to W3C standards (DOM Level 1, part of DOM Level 2, CSS1).  </s>
<s> Many previous Netscape proprietary document objects are no longer supported, e.g. the layer and ilayer objects.  </s>
<s> Refer to WebReview's comparison chart (updated 14 January 2001) for more info on CSS1 support [2].  </s>
<s> He says, "Despite the frustrations of having to change the way we work, the strict nature of a browser's adherence to standards makes sense.  </s>
<s> If there's a certain level of core standards support in all major browsers, it makes our jobs as Web designers and developers much easier, much less time consuming, and more cost effective."  </s>
<s> Netscape 6 is much less forgiving of invalid markup which should hopefully force designers/developers to validate their code.  </s>
<s> That push should help accessibility quite a lot.  </s>
<s> Perhaps one of our primary activities should be working to help people worldwide to upgrade to IE5.5 on Windows, IE5 on the Mac, or Netscape 6 on Linux/Unix/Win/Mac.  </s>
<s> At least that might help solve some of the baseline capabilities problems.  </s>
<s> It's a dream but perhaps not so far off.  </s>
<s> I talked with someone who recycles old computers to give to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> I had assumed that this was his primary business and that people with disabilities were spending money out of their own pockets to buy assistive technology and computers.  </s>
<s> Instead, he says most of the people he works with here in Wisconsin (please don't generalize this too much), get money for technology from the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation.  </s>
<s> Since they often spend $1000 or more for assistive technology they are also getting brand new computers off the shelf.  </s>
<s> He receives more offers than he can handle for donations of old computers and turns a lot of people away - the computers are too old and worthless (a 386 with a black and white monitor for example).  </s>
<s> He says most of the people he works with, if not all, will be using the computer to communicate (e-mail, web, messaging, etc.).  </s>
<s> I want to know what it is like elsewhere.  </s>
<s> What are other people experiencing in their part of the world?  </s>
<s> Anne (school environment for children with learning disabilities - U.S.), Jim (school environment for children with visual disabilities - U.S.), Claus (Denmark), Lisa (Israel), Max (Japan), and Jason (Australia), Chuck (Canada) - as well as everyone else - What is happening to older computers?  </s>

<s> One approach to the "user agent capability" problem, which I don't think has been clearly enunciated thus far, would be as follows: 1.  </s>
<s> To make it clear that socio-economic factors, which may be a direct or indirect result of various forms of discrimination, can affect access to computing resources and may thus preclude certain individuals and groups from taking full or immediate advantage of recent developments in user agent software and/or assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> 2. To acknowledge openly that any firm criterion as to when a particular technology or feature has become so widespread as to be available, for practical purposes, to everyone who uses the web, is bound to be somewhat arbitrary and to exclude certain individuals who, for whatever reason, have not upgraded their hardware and/or software.  </s>
<s> 3. To state that, for the purpose of defininng conformance to the guidelines, such socio-economic considerations will not be taken into account, but that implementors of the guidelines should bear them in mind in deciding to what extent their content should be backward compatible.  </s>
<s> Thus, implementors would be free, within certain limits, to weigh the advantages of backward compatibility against other factors, such as the added convenience, improved features and reduced development costs which may be associated with newer technologies.  </s>
<s> 4. To prescribe, for purposes of conformance to the guidelines, that a particular format, protocol or feature of any given technology may be utilized or relied upon in web content when the following conditions have been met: (1) there exist one or more implementations thereof, available under major operating systems (E.G. MacOS, MS-Windows and Unix); (2) these implementations are compatible with assistive technologies; and (3) the implementations are interoperable.  </s>
<s> For this purpose, only the latest versions of user agents and/or assistive technologies will be considered; if user agents/assistve technologies vary across platforms, only the common features thereof (available on all platforms for which development is ongoing) will be taken into account.  </s>
<s> Bravo! It is a bit like making our assumtion list, and linking these ussumtions to our checkpoints (wich assumtions are relevent to wich checkpiont).  </s>
<s> Wendy pointed out that we need to specifie our assumtions anyway.  </s>
<s> Futher we should note that by global stardardes, both Spain and Israel have relivltivy high standards of living (both rated between 15 20 top contries).  </s>
<s> No were near the US, but still high.  </s>
<s> (I belive Riussue is rated in the late thirties.)  </s>
<s> That impies that global baseline critiera, may well be almost non exixtent.  </s>
<s> However baseline cfrytieria are truely site specific.  </s>
<s> Information sites can be made to conform to global crytiera, However a Minosate law firm, need not worry about about global criteria.  </s>
<s> A federal or US GOV site, also can afford some leniency.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, one of the most gratifying part of working with special need, was providing on line support to parents of LD children in rural India, were the school teacher had not heard of any forms of LD.  </s>
<s> It would have been a shame to have lost that opportunity by inappropriate site design.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it should help to see our job as to provide the information.  </s>
<s> Let us worry less about how to legislate its implementation.  </s>
<s> We can provide the information, so that web designers legislators and others can make informed discussion.  </s>
<s> It would seem that conformance is a multi dimensional concept.  </s>
<s> With issues like user groups, extent of ease of access and baselines all existing in separate planes.  </s>
<s> We could have fun with the implication of this, by attributing to each checkpoint relative x,y,z functions (Kynn, Sean - something you would like to do one night when you can not sleep) so that people can select their criteria, and get their relative guidelines, or conformance level ;) May be not.  </s>
<s> But still calling it like it is is a good direction to take.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> I think the main problem is that we can only look at how many rotary dial phones are in use, learn that it is less than the number of cell phones thrown into the dumpster on the TV ad and conclude that obsolescence will run past us before we can collate the survey.  </s>
<s> The Web's the thing and the underlayment recedes in importance with each passing moment.  </s>
<s> Do you think it is, therefore, unsolvable?  </s>
<s> Because we, the experts on accessibility, many of us full time "web gods" in the eyes of the average user, can't figure it out -- what hope do they have?  </s>
<s> If we can't even collate a survey with the W3C's resources, knowledge, and influence, how on earth can the typical corporate web monkey hope to make the decisions -themselves-, which is what the current "until user agents" phrasing demands?  </s>
<s> I think we have to do -something-, clearly, and I think that "something" consists of either making the decision for the WCAG reader or giving them enough information to make the decision themselves.  </s>
<s> The burden has to be on -us-, not on -them-.  </s>
<s> Maybe it -is- insoluble.  </s>
<s> In which case we need to work around the  </s>
<s> problem in some way.  </s>
<s> I don't know what that is.  </s>

<s> The "until user agent" conundrum is a classic "moving target" riddle.  </s>
<s> For one thing part of the "when" of it is self-proclaimed herein!  </s>
<s> When we mighty "lords of ivory" so decree, then someone who was perfectly happy with stuff has to scream/kick while being dragged into an imperial notion of what her future should be like.  </s>
<s> Just the pressure on Lynx exemplifies the dilemma.  </s>
<s> I had a severe problem with the then "new" interface that *required* a mouse to use.  </s>
<s> I was (still am!) much more comfortable with keyboard interactions but was left no choice.  </s>
<s> The same mind-set that proclaims "let them eat cake" as to such seemingly trivial acts as downloading/learning/de-bugging a new version of a browser (however much "improved" it claims to be) must be guarded against in the "legacy maintenance" area.  </s>
<s> In some sense of how Kynn used "insoluble", I believe it is outside our capability/scope/power to decree that "thou shalt not hover/mouseover/blink" even though we try to do much of that.  </s>
<s> And as to proscribing, we'd best think long/hard about for whom we exist.  </s>
<s> Our clients have a long history of being ignored/overlooked/demeaned/+ and the last thing we should do is decide that some are "more equal".  </s>
<s> This doesn't pretend to offer much for specificity in "conformance objectivity" but just like the laws in Oz, the decisions as to whether something is accessible will be decided by "the people" (at least their repressentatives) and the guidelines are just that.  </s>
<s> They make the rules, we just provide what we think are baseline criteria to the best of our ability.  </s>
<s> With levels of "importance".  </s>
<s> If we re-examine every instance of "until user agents" in WCAG 1.0 it might be instructive from the viewpoint of how "general/abstract" impacts on "what must I do?".  </s>
<s> We just can't tell users they have to work around systems that require a mouse nor the designers that they can't use mouse features.  </s>
<s> Hence "conundrum".  </s>
<s> Functions (interactivity, etc.) as well as content must persevere despite transformation.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
