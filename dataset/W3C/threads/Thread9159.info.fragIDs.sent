<s> Logically, names and top-level existentially quantified variables are effectively identical.  </s>
<s> If they are not effectively identical in RDF, the difference must depend on some aspect of RDF that goes beyond the usual model theory.  </s>
<s> No objection to that, but I would like to know what that aspect is so that we have some chance of capturing it in a formal semantics.  </s>
<s> The issue over whether Person1 and Person2 are the same person is really not to do with anonymity as such, but with equality (identity).  </s>
<s> If the language has some way to say that two different names denote the same entity, ie some way to say a = b, then this issue is relevant and needs to be got clear.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't have any way to say that, however, then there really isnt any point in haggling over this matter.  </s>
<s> It will make no real difference to the language, since any interpretation that satisfies a set of RDF assertions could be extended to a similar one with a unique names assumption that also satisfies it.  </s>
