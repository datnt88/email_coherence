I'd like to propose a couple of meetings. 1. one to talk about the possible vocabularies for images and parts of images 2. to decide which vocabularies to use and come up with a sample piece of RDF that represents the sort of annotation we want (1) is one of the purposes of the new W3C proposed image description list, but obviously we need a quick decision - we need to pick one that does what we want, and we have a couple of examples. 
(2) is also becoming urgent, as it impacts on everthing else, including the UI and getting on with annotating. 
Somewhere we might also talk about what things we need to identify (images, people, parts of images, places etc), and how we might go about it. 
Any takers? 
I can do (almost) any time - any prefered?

I can do basically any time, though the later it is, the better.

Subscribe Instructions Body: subscribe Unsubscribe Instructions Body: unsubscribe Help Body: help How about a meeting tomorrow about parts of images (1) and one on Wednesday to decide on a sample piece of RDF (2)? 
I suggest 1600 GMT for both. 
This could change - please let me know (offlist?) if you can't make it and you want to be there, and we'll try and come to some sort of compromise. 
Alternatively, if you have a strong view and can't make either meeting, send a message here describing your position on either topic. 
I think there will be much more discussion in the future about how best to describe parts of images in the RDF community, so tomorrow's meeting would only be a discussion with a view to setting out a proposal for this project to use.

Subscribe Instructions Body: subscribe Unsubscribe Instructions Body: unsubscribe Help Body: help hi Greg The reason I put them that way around was because the sample RDF has a dependency on the way we represent parts of an image. 
I'll see who turns up and we'll make the best use of the time we can. 
If we use the times to come up with proposals to send to this list, then people can comment further on them here.

Many thanks for your comments. 
I will make sure they are taken account of in the meeting. 
Libby Hi all, 1600 GMT is midnight here (Tokyo) and I'm not sure to be able to join, so I would put some comments here.

Date: Tue Jan 20, 2004 8:43:51 AM America/New_York To: Subject: It would be better for me if we could have the meeting regarding parts of images on Wed and discuss the sample RDF today at 1600 GMT. 
I am in some meetings today and don't know if I can make the 1600 GMT. 
If that is the best for image discussion...go for it. 
I'd like to suggest as strongly as possible that we make decisions for a first cut at things by Wed/Thursday. 
This first cut will be just that...what we use to assemble a first iteration of the repository. 
I think the elements of this first cut are: - 100+ images or so from our own collections - one CC license - Fotonotes interface to annotate parts with revised fields (3-4) to enter some structured information - An advanced interface for adding RDF (etc) information to the image overall - AKTive space viewing for browsing all images - Jim Hendler's stuff as the first "alternative" interface. 
I see this first cut lasting between 2 and 4 weeks. 
So we can all live with it a bit and then see what we need to change/improve. 
But let's pull together a "first draft" version of everything this week. 
That gives us until Feb 5 to play with before having the repository live. 
(This project is going great, everyone! 
Thanks!) best, Greg This is the TEMPORARY discussion list for the W3 Semantic-Photo History Project.
