<s> On 16 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>
<s> A straw poll indicates the question needs further discussion in the work group.  </s>
<s> B.13 Should XML remove SGML's prohibition on ENTITY attributes for notations (11.4.1)?  </s>
<s> This would make XML incompatible with SGML systems.  </s>
<s> We need a consistent view on whether or not we are seeking to achieve compatibility.  </s>

<s> It's funny -- I came across this yesterday, as SoftQuad Panorama actually uses ENTITY notation attributes in its style sheet DTD (oops).  </s>
<s> They're used to specify a mask for an icon.  </s>

<s> When we stumbled upon this silly restriction, I asked Charles about it, and he wrote me as follows:  </s>
<s> The restrictions on data attribute declared values is on the list to be examined during the revision of SGML.  </s>
<s> I introduced data attributes late in the game so I did it conservatively (I was concerned about long chains of entities that had data attributes among which were entities that had data attributes, etc.)  </s>
<s> Soooo, we have kept the entity attribute in the style sheet DTD--which is proprietary anyway--and look forward to the day when, hopefully, entity attributes for notations are allowed in both SGML and XML.  </s>
