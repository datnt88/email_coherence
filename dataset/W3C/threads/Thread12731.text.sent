Looks good to me. 
I will keep my eye open for Canadian discussion documents to add to the list.

Keep this hush-hush until it's announced tommorrow. 
Well, the Web development community is not going to be happy with IE5, due out tommorrow. 
The Steering Committee of the Web Standards Project, (http://www.webstandards.org) received all of our review copies of the IE5 release last week and have started testing their implementations of HTML 4.0, CSS-1, DOM Level 1, XML and other recommendations that have come out since IE4. 
I'm sorry to say that their effort has been less than satisfactory. 
I've been the member working on examining the HTML 4.0 implementation and speaking for myself, there are STILL problems in it. 
CSS-1 has few improvements but not enough to really let Webmasters make full use of it and DOM Level 1 and XML support is reportedly horrendous. 
I've created a partial HTML Test Suite to examine the HTML 4.0 rec. 
and will have more detailed information to tell you tommorrow. 
For now, don't let this e-mail leave the group. 
Thanks.
