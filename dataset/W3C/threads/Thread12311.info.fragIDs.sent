<s> Rick, The process of converting inaccessible HTML to accessible HTML can't be 100% automated.  </s>
<s> It will require some human intervention to make decisions.  </s>
<s> "A-Prompt" is a tool under development that tries to automate the process as much as possible.  </s>

<s> Rich, as well as Aprompt there are other tools which will help an author meet the requirements.  </s>
<s> Some of the requirements are things which cannot be fully automated (for example, a computer is generaly bad at describing the function of an image within a page, or describing a complex image).  </s>
<s> There are authoring tools such as HoTMetaL and HotDog 6.0 that provide support for authors to make content accessible.  </s>
<s> The working group would like to hear of any that you find particularly good, and if possible have reviews of them.  </s>
<s> There sare also a number of authoring tools where it is possible to make content acessible so long as you are aware of the requirements.  </s>
<s> There are unfortunately some where even this is very difficult or impossible.  </s>
