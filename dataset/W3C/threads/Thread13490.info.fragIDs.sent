Possible Agenda Items - presenting EARL to humans (RDF to XHTML via XSLT) - EARL Primer - Existing tools - redesign of page, new tools to add? - AERT open issues, look for msgs from me - next f2f Participants: Katie, William, Wendy, Sean, Summary of discussion (detailed minutes follow): - F2F in September sounds good. 
One option is to look for a place in Brighton. 
Suggested that if people attending by phone that minutes be taken in IRC. 
Need a better phone system as well. 
- It is not clear where this group is headed. 
After we finish EARL, there was discussion of merging with WCAG and AU, or providing support for those groups in developing tools to help them get through CR with respective advanced versions of their documents. 
- Not clear how developers will include or refer to EARL since there isn't 
a MIME type. 
There is a possibility of using http headers with RIDL, but 
that is not yet a standard and not clear if it will be implemented. 
Therefore, we talked about using comments within headers like CSS and scripting use for backwards compatibility. 
- SP talked about XWeb a new language he and Aaron Swartz are working 
on. 
The group is very interested in learning more, since it includes a switch-like statement to associate multiple alternatives with a piece of content. 
SP needs to check with Aaron before releasing the URI to everyone. 
Also discussed an article written with Murray Altheim. 
SP needs to send URI to article to the list. 
See summary below. 
- WL wants an abstract of EARL to take to the DIWG. 
He will summarize the issues of the DIWG so someone can write an abstract that shows how EARL can help with those issues. 
- We briefly discussed if WCAG 2.0 would require machine-readable assertions of the accessibility of the content. 
So far the WCAG WG has discussed granular assertions but have not gotten into detailed conformance discussions as of yet. 
***Detailed minutes Next F2F WL Seattle in September WC However, SP couldn't make it. 
Therefore, what if we went to SP? (SP is in Brighton Sussex) WL Make sure that minutes are in irc. 
Need a better phone system - everyone should be wearing headsets. 
WC Focus of next F2F? 
KHS Where is this group going? 
Purpose of ER? WC Working on tools to help ATAG and WCAG get through CR. Implementations of EARL. 
Need to do WART to show that it is "real." 
SP Link EARL from XWeb. 
EARL doesn't have a MIME type. 
WC Do annotations have MIME types? 
SP RDF, not officially listed MIME type. 
WCAG should be labeled for what it is. 
Namespaces help, if not XML rely on MIME types. 
KHS possible to register? 
SP Yes, need RDF registered first. 
SVG uses the +xml, we would need to use +xml and +rdf. 
WL What can we do to enable author to enable EARL declaration? 
SP Http headers using RIDL. 
Could define new types of content w/URIs. 
WL what if you had a comment and code at beginning that made it something you could use. 
SP Like P3P labels and PICs. 
OR http-equiv attribute. 
WL Kludges are perjorative, but the whole thing is a kludge. 
Legacy is non-existent. 
SP That's what they did for CSS in HTML, a comment. 
WL I think there is some way to do it. 
Put meta anywhere. 
SP Serialze EARL in augmented meta data. 
Perhaps by qualifying some of the types. 
WL Idea of authors to make assertions is needed. 
Everything presumes a certain set of baseline capabilities/system requirements. 
One assertion that an author makes are the presumptions, e.g. you need IE7 to use this. 
/* SP describes XWeb, a language that he and Aaron are writing. 
It's a modularization of HTML, true separation of presentation from 
content. 
Allows multiple alternatives for content. 
Looked at using switch 
statements to determine which alternative to use. 
Packaging for reuse 
between documents. 
SP has URI, but not sure Aaron wants to publish to people yet. 
We all encouraged SP to prod Aaron to publish URI. 
SP said it had only been in development for about a week. 
Also talked about a note with Murray Altheim re: modularization of XHTML, augmeta. 
*/ 
Action SP: send URI to list re: modularization of XHTML - augmeta. 
WL Need an abstract of EARL to take to DIWG. 
Action WL: summarize issues of DIWG and send to group so someone can write abstract of EARL for DIWG. 
WL Highlight things that make use or potentially make use of EARL. 
SP Machine-readable assertions required in WCAG 2.0? 
WC Not yet, have talked about granular assertions.

RDDL - http://www.rddl.org/ 
xWeb - http://purl.org/net/xweb 
It's more of a replacement (well... "alternative") to HTML; it will have a similar scope, but it's a kind of HTML for the new millennium. 
HTML still has many odd features, and remnants of its pre-Web history. 
xWebL will of course be modularized (that's a design "requirement"). 
Yes, and yes. 
I've looked carefully at the design, and gone through a lot of material trying to work on this, and it's going really well; but we need some of the key UI players on board, and they're all busy. 
Very much a grass-roots personal thing at the moment, although it could spark off some amount of interest. 
It has a cool name, so it can't fail (that has indeed been the most difficult thing to come up with)! 
We currently have an " alt " element which has the same definition as in RDF - i.e. "choose one from any of the following to render". 
But the association information should be kept by the parser. 
I found it really fun to go through the different ways of associating alternatives with text and markup, and after a lot of debating, I arrived at the current method, which sorts out the external links to multimedia objects into a particular container, and then references that from the content either as an explicit link, or as an annotation. 
I learned a lot in the process, and still have a lot to think about. 
See also my rationale for separating the annotation mechanisms out in [1] (which is well worth a read). 
Aaron is using a different method, but his way does not *require* textual content to be associated with the multimedia. 
Is currently in low circulation (just XTM and here, I think).

Monday July 1 is a holiday here in Canada so I won't be able to make the call.

Here's the reference:- It's part of the HTTP extension framework, so it can be implemented now.
