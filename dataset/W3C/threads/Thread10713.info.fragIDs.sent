I've just updated the disposition of lc2 comments document [1] There is a bit of tidying up to be done: - I've posted an attempt to close comments arising from Herman's review of semantics - DanC has the action to respond to I18N comments 
However, that still leaves 5 comments on TestCases and one on primer needing a response. 
Brian [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20031010-comments/ 
I have still to agree the text of the possible note concerning not using %-escapes with Peter. 
Such a note also appears in the recently published namespaces 1.1 PR. Jeremy 
One (more than one?) of those comments is Dave R's question on the test cases whose correctness depends on Pat's Semantics draft - that JJC has also raised with the list. 
I can't divine exactly what the situation is with that, so I was holding off from commenting. 
Sandro's raised a couple of points which might be boiled down to one comment, that the test case manifest format enshrines a "closed world" view. 
This comment would apply to the declarations of: entailmentRules, supportedDatatype (I think, WebOnt's test cases have the same issue 
with datatypes), and the premise documents for entialment tests. 
The options are basically to - either fix this with a small change to the manifest syntax and the test case document describing that syntax. 
However, that small change would mean that the manifest format changes at quite a late stage. 
(Jos 
amongst others is in favour of doing it "right" here.) 
This change is substantive but does not affect any of the actual test cases, only their descriptions. 
- introduce the entailmentRules marker for simple entailment. 
This does not address all of Sandro's comments. 
- reject the closed world comment. 
Such a rejection would be on the basis that it's just too late in the game to alter the test format. 
In support of this, the test case document has always claimed: The test cases have been created to illustrate the resolution of particular issues on the RDF Issue Tracking list. 
Consequently, test case results should always be interpreted in conjunction with the resolution of the associated issue and the description (if any) attached to the test case in the manifest. 
In other words, although we make effort to enable running the test cases automatically, if your harness "fails" a test then inspection "by hand" may be required. 
This would include the failure of a test case due to the open/closed world issue. 
So "where we're at" is that there are several options. 
Were time not an 
issue I'd fix the test case format - I believe the number of test harness authors is small and "doing it right" is worthwhile. 
However I appreciate that this is effectively a substantive change to the test case document (since harnesses will be broken) so I'm unprepared to make that call without the approval of the chairs and/or WG. 
Of course, if semantics has had substantive changes (which I think are to the good) post-LC2 then making a substantive change to the test format seems like less of an issue.

I shave with Occam's Razor. 
Please pick one and propose it. 
i.e. draft a response to Sandro; then the chair will let you know if it needs WG input. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
In order to address all of Sandro's comments on the closed-world assumptions in the test case manifest, the following changes will be made to the manifest format: 
For parser tests, exactly one each of the test:inputDocument and test:outputDocument elements must be present. 
The test case document will be updated with words to ensure exactly this. 
For entailment tests, the test:conclusionDocument is mandatory and must be present exactly once for each test case. 
Since entailment tests exist which take multiple premise documents, the test:premiseDocument is renamed and becomes list-valued, and is represented as follows: This form is used regardless of the number of premise documents (there may be one or more). 
The list of entailmentRules is replaced by a single-valued element which must be present once and is mandatory. 
It takes the following form: test:entailmentRules rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/testSchema#Simple"/ and can take values in the test: namespace: test:Simpleto indicate simple entailment test:RDFto indicate rdf entailment test:RDFSto indicate rdfs entailment test:Datatypesto indicate rdfs with additional datatypes No value is present for "RDF + datatypes(...)" because semantics builds on RDFS to describe datatyped interpretations. 
If the "Datatypes" entailment rules are chosen, then a list-valued test:datatypeSupport declaration MUST be present. 
Its form is as follows, with zero or more datatypes declared. 
There is no declaration necessary for the rdf:XMLLiteral datatype since it is required by RDFS. 
Finally, the test:document element in the miscellaneous test cases is replaced with a collection-valued test:documents. 
The test case document will be amended with an updated description of the format; the manifest descriptions of all test cases will similarly be updated. 
[OPTION, which MAY be added to the proposal if WG considers necessary, is to change the URL of the large manifest file to something like .../ManifestV2.rdf]

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ ...You're visualising the _duck_ taped over my _mouth_..? 
First, the entailmentRules marker for "Simple" entailment is added; that's the first of Sandro's comments, and Brian has indicated that this is editorial. 
Secondly, a simpler approach to Sandro's closed-world comment is: The working group accept this comment that the test case manifest format currently has some closed-world assumptions. 
However, it is felt that a change to the manifest format at this stage would be potentially counter-productive, requiring effort from all maintainers of test case harnesses in order to run the same set of tests. 
Therefore a postponed issue, [test-case-format-closed-world], has been created, to track this concern. 
It's not an outright rejection and meets the time constraints of PR, so I think this might be the better middle ground - ?

If we OK this then the final version of the test case document (with any last withdrawn test cases removed and the test case table regenerated) is here: ...and with agreement from Brian and/or DanC, I'll send the response to Sandro.
