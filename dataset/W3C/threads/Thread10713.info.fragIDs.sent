<s> I've just updated the disposition of lc2 comments document [1] There is a bit of tidying up to be done: - I've posted an attempt to close comments arising from Herman's review of semantics - DanC has the action to respond to I18N comments  </s>
<s> However, that still leaves 5 comments on TestCases and one on primer needing a response.  </s>
<s> Brian [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20031010-comments/  </s>
<s> I have still to agree the text of the possible note concerning not using %-escapes with Peter.  </s>
<s> Such a note also appears in the recently published namespaces 1.1 PR. Jeremy  </s>
<s> One (more than one?) of those comments is Dave R's question on the test cases whose correctness depends on Pat's Semantics draft - that JJC has also raised with the list.  </s>
<s> I can't divine exactly what the situation is with that, so I was holding off from commenting.  </s>
<s> Sandro's raised a couple of points which might be boiled down to one comment, that the test case manifest format enshrines a "closed world" view.  </s>
<s> This comment would apply to the declarations of: entailmentRules, supportedDatatype (I think, WebOnt's test cases have the same issue  </s>
<s> with datatypes), and the premise documents for entialment tests.  </s>
<s> The options are basically to - either fix this with a small change to the manifest syntax and the test case document describing that syntax.  </s>
<s> However, that small change would mean that the manifest format changes at quite a late stage.  </s>
<s> (Jos  </s>
<s> amongst others is in favour of doing it "right" here.)  </s>
<s> This change is substantive but does not affect any of the actual test cases, only their descriptions.  </s>
<s> - introduce the entailmentRules marker for simple entailment.  </s>
<s> This does not address all of Sandro's comments.  </s>
<s> - reject the closed world comment.  </s>
<s> Such a rejection would be on the basis that it's just too late in the game to alter the test format.  </s>
<s> In support of this, the test case document has always claimed: The test cases have been created to illustrate the resolution of particular issues on the RDF Issue Tracking list.  </s>
<s> Consequently, test case results should always be interpreted in conjunction with the resolution of the associated issue and the description (if any) attached to the test case in the manifest.  </s>
<s> In other words, although we make effort to enable running the test cases automatically, if your harness "fails" a test then inspection "by hand" may be required.  </s>
<s> This would include the failure of a test case due to the open/closed world issue.  </s>
<s> So "where we're at" is that there are several options.  </s>
<s> Were time not an  </s>
<s> issue I'd fix the test case format - I believe the number of test harness authors is small and "doing it right" is worthwhile.  </s>
<s> However I appreciate that this is effectively a substantive change to the test case document (since harnesses will be broken) so I'm unprepared to make that call without the approval of the chairs and/or WG.  </s>
<s> Of course, if semantics has had substantive changes (which I think are to the good) post-LC2 then making a substantive change to the test format seems like less of an issue.  </s>

<s> Please pick one and propose it.  </s>
<s> i.e. draft a response to Sandro; then the chair will let you know if it needs WG input.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> In order to address all of Sandro's comments on the closed-world assumptions in the test case manifest, the following changes will be made to the manifest format:  </s>
<s> For parser tests, exactly one each of the test:inputDocument and test:outputDocument elements must be present.  </s>
<s> The test case document will be updated with words to ensure exactly this.  </s>
<s> For entailment tests, the test:conclusionDocument is mandatory and must be present exactly once for each test case.  </s>
<s> Since entailment tests exist which take multiple premise documents, the test:premiseDocument is renamed and becomes list-valued, and is represented as follows: This form is used regardless of the number of premise documents (there may be one or more).  </s>
<s> The list of entailmentRules is replaced by a single-valued element which must be present once and is mandatory.  </s>
<s> It takes the following form: test:entailmentRules rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/testSchema#Simple"/ and can take values in the test: namespace: test:Simpleto indicate simple entailment test:RDFto indicate rdf entailment test:RDFSto indicate rdfs entailment test:Datatypesto indicate rdfs with additional datatypes No value is present for "RDF + datatypes(...)" because semantics builds on RDFS to describe datatyped interpretations.  </s>
<s> If the "Datatypes" entailment rules are chosen, then a list-valued test:datatypeSupport declaration MUST be present.  </s>
<s> Its form is as follows, with zero or more datatypes declared.  </s>
<s> There is no declaration necessary for the rdf:XMLLiteral datatype since it is required by RDFS.  </s>
<s> Finally, the test:document element in the miscellaneous test cases is replaced with a collection-valued test:documents.  </s>
<s> The test case document will be amended with an updated description of the format; the manifest descriptions of all test cases will similarly be updated.  </s>
<s> [OPTION, which MAY be added to the proposal if WG considers necessary, is to change the URL of the large manifest file to something like .../ManifestV2.rdf]  </s>

<s> http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ ...You're visualising the _duck_ taped over my _mouth_..?  </s>
<s> First, the entailmentRules marker for "Simple" entailment is added; that's the first of Sandro's comments, and Brian has indicated that this is editorial.  </s>
<s> Secondly, a simpler approach to Sandro's closed-world comment is: The working group accept this comment that the test case manifest format currently has some closed-world assumptions.  </s>
<s> However, it is felt that a change to the manifest format at this stage would be potentially counter-productive, requiring effort from all maintainers of test case harnesses in order to run the same set of tests.  </s>
<s> Therefore a postponed issue, [test-case-format-closed-world], has been created, to track this concern.  </s>
<s> It's not an outright rejection and meets the time constraints of PR, so I think this might be the better middle ground - ?  </s>
