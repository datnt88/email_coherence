<s> There are some attributes that have been deprecated and will fail strict validation and pass transitional validation.  </s>

<s> document isn't valid XHTML as the bgcolor element has been deprecated.  </s>
<s> The HTML DOM spec isn't clear if the bgcolor should reflect the color as implied by a stylesheet or only an explicit bgcolor attribute.  </s>

<s> when the transition is past, using strict should produce the most widely applicable tests.  </s>
<s> The tests that use HTMLFormElement.name to check that the appropriate form was returned should be changed to use HTMLElement.id and/or assertSame() instead of forcing the test document to be transitional just to put a name attribute in.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if the spec provides any guidance to whether a strict (only) implementation could throw an exception or map an deprecated attribute to another attribute.  </s>
<s> We'll have to look at where this is occurring, and see if this is the only reason the test input file is transitional.  </s>
<s> I only see 8 tests that use name interface="HTMLFormElement" ...we'll take a look at them.  </s>
<s> The bigger problem we are having at the moment is the number of DOM constructs that refer to items that are deprecated in HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> Testing these forces the HTML documents to be transitional.  </s>
<s> I would think that since they are in the DOM spec, we would be interested in having tests for them in the test suite.  </s>
<s> If someone has an implemention that doesn't support transitional HTML, these tests would be problematic for them.  </s>
<s> I'm not seeing anything in the spec that addresses what should be done if a deprecated feature is not supported.  </s>
