<s> Here is a proposed plan for our switch to WSDL 2.0: 1- Editors to the necessary changes within the files (s/WSDL 1.2/WSDL 2.0/) until the group decide to publish them.  </s>
<s> 2- Once the group decided to publish, I will copy the files in the directory 2002/ws/desc/wsdl20 _in the CVS database itself_.  </s>
<s> Editors are guaranteed to loose their changes on the old files in the meantime.  </s>
<s> I will change the name of the files as well.  </s>
<s> Copying the files in the CVS database will preserve the log history on them.  </s>
<s> The latest URIs of the document will become: As soon as I'm sure that I didn't mess up with the files, I will cvs remove the files in wsdl12, except for the files that are not related with the specifications (such as wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/*).  </s>
<s> It would be good to put the files that are not related part of the specifications in a separate directory.  </s>
<s> Feel free to create a new directory under 2002/ws/desc for other documents (task force documents, ...).  </s>
<s> 3- As soon as I am done, I will send an email.  </s>
