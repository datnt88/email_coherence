Hi, When using "Make Book", it is very easy to edit the output (eg to remove extra headers and footers), and click the save button before realising that this is an aggregate document which should not be saved, as that overwrites the original Table of Contents page. 
Would it be possible for the "Make Book" function to rename the "current" document, so that if the user clicks save, the book document gets saved to docBook.html instead of overwriting the doc.html that it was dericed from?

That's a good suggestion. 
We could automatically set the document in Read-only mode at the end of the "Make Book". 
So the user shouldn't save the document by error with the same name. 
He/she has to explicitly change the mode to continue to work on this generated document.

I prefer the original proposal of renaming the file resulting from"Make book". 
Saving the resulting file with a different name is usefull, for example for reading or printing with another browser. 
For the moment, I use IE5 to print because it is the only browser I could find that manages CSS page-break. 
Editing the resulting file if is indeed not a good idea, so switching to Read-only could also be done, providing that it is possible to save the renamed file.

It's dangerous to automatically generate a new name when making the book. 
I guess it's better to let the user define that name with the Save As command. 
Agreed. Irene.
