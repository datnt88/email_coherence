<s> I was skimming the minutes of the IPng WG from the Washington, DC IETF meeting, and found this: [Start of excerpt]  </s>
<s> IPv6 Addresses in URL's / B. Carpenter Design team meet in the bar a few nights ago.  </s>
<s> Need numeric address in URL's for emergency operations (or robotic apps).  </s>
<s> Colons break URL parsers "hostname" syntax Proposals: Issue: Should IPng w.g. reopen the "colon" notation?  </s>
<s> Heated discussion.  </s>
<s> Most comments that this is stupid, we should not reopen IPv6 text notation.  </s>
<s> Long discussion.  </s>
<s> Issue seems to be that many parsers that take URL's are very limited.  </s>
<s> No one was in favor of changing current text representation.  </s>
<s> Extremely strong consensus!  </s>
<s> It was noted that the issue is probably only relevant for complete web browsers (e.g., Netscape, Microsoft, etc.), not all other applications that use URL's.  </s>
<s> If the complete web browsers can be  </s>
<s> changed it is very likely to be sufficient.  </s>
<s> Recommend that the primary preferred syntax for IPv6 addresses in URL's be: The IPv6 address should be enclosed in brackets.  </s>
<s> URL parsers that can not support this notation can either support the proposed alternative syntax: or not allow IPv6 addresses to be entered directly.  </s>
<s> [End of excerpt] I'm not sure if this is really an "issue" for HTTP/1.1, but I suspect that the IESG will want to be sure that HTTP/1.1 syntax is compatible with IPv6, and if there are conflicts, we should probably make sure they are addressed.  </s>
<s> Or make an explicit statement that we are not going to address them in this version of the protocol (and why not).  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> A quick check of our search engine software shows that most of our spidering will also break with these URLs.  </s>
<s> That's not as big a deal as the "complete browsers" breaking, from our perspective, but I do think it indicates that these parsers are built into a lot more than they thought.  </s>
<s> I would bet, for example, that it would complete break some of the firmware "browsers" being built into phones by the pocketnet people.  </s>

<s> It was noted in that thread that [ and ] were illegal in URLs.  </s>
<s> We did not really reach a consensus, but one intermediate conclusion was that a notation like with the .  </s>
<s> separating the address from the port number, would do the trick.  </s>
<s> I see however that you quoted some ipv6 addresses which have a .  </s>
<s> in them above, I think we assumed at the time that the ipv6 notation would use : only.  </s>
<s> Anyway, this is probably an issue between the ipv6 people and whoever feels responsible for maintaining URLs (Larry(?)).  </s>
<s> I am just providing some pointers.  </s>
<s> I think we should at least add a note to the 1.1 spec to warn implementers of this issue.  </s>

<s> This whole issue is really one for the URI documents, rather than HTTP... Of course, we'd like them to get to draft standard soon as well, so that we can reference them rather than incorporating duplication.  </s>
<s> Yet another headache of mine of last week... At the IETF, a number of us (quite interesting collection of people), talked through this issue (over beer in the bar, of course; was the most fun conversation of the IETF I had...)...  </s>
<s> This was alluded to in the minutes (the "design team").  </s>
<s> Attending included: Brian Carpenter, (IAB chair) Larry Masinter myself Henrik Frystyk Steve Deering (Cisco, and IPNG heavyweight).  </s>
<s> probably one or two more I forget.  </s>
<s> Bottom line was that the browsers were the least of the problem; we almost certainly could get the big players to change the browsers... But... The browser is the tip of the iceberg...  </s>
<s> The first proposal (things like brackets or other syntactic changes to URI's) would break a large number of tools that know about HTML, XML and the like, and that therefore something like the .ipv6  </s>
<s> domain hack proposal was the only viable approach.  </s>
<s> These tools vastly outnumber the browsers in the world.  </s>
<s> Steve was going to take the []less proposal back to the working group meeting.  </s>
<s> Sounds like the proposal got taken back, but not everyone understood the issue (in particular that the browsers were the least of the problem) and think that URI syntax changes are feasible.... (wish they were, as URI syntax is far from ideal, but reality can be very hard...).  </s>
<s> Looks like some further education of the IPV6 community may be in order, if Steve Deering or Brian Carpenter thinks that things may go wrong... - Jim  </s>

<s> This is an interoperation issue.  </s>
<s> The strength of consensus inside the IP-NG group is frankly not very relevant.  </s>
<s> Their proposal will break a substantial piece of existing infrastructure.  </s>
<s> At the very least we deserve some form of argument for the IP-NG group's preference.  </s>
<s> Until one is provided I don't think we can have much of an argument here.  </s>
<s> I am not even sure where the colon notation was intended to be used.  </s>
<s> If they intend it to be used within URIs then the question is defacto reopened.  </s>
<s> If they don't want to reopen the discussion it is likely that the URI group will address the issue by creating a new (and incompatible) text representation.  </s>
<s> It is acceptable for a group to introduce a notation that has limited utility, it is also acceptable for a group to negotiate with others to achieve a consensus about a solution that will meet the needs of a wider constituency.  </s>
<s> It is not acceptable for a group to declare that they want a notation to be general but they don't want to talk about it As Jim points out the question is not one for the IP-NG group to make, it is within the URI group's remit and ultimately is the type of matter where the IESG may have to rule.  </s>

<s> Perhaps we can get it right in HTTP-NG?  </s>

<s> This is correct.  </s>
<s> IPV6 can "contain" IPV4 addresses and this can be done by concatenating IPV6 syntax and IPV4 syntax so that an IP address can contain both : and .  </s>
