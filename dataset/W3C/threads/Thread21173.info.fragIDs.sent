<s> Hi, Amaya 7.2 (Spanish dialogues) crashes when the Timeline button is cliked.  </s>
<s> The reason is that the Spanish translation "Planificaci?n"  </s>
<s> has an accent.  </s>
<s> If I change the es-amayamsg file 308th item from "Planificaci?n" to "Planificacion", Amaya does not crash.  </s>
<s> But other buttons, like "Graphics" have accents in their Spanish translation ("Gr?ficos") and Amaya does not crash when they are clicked.  </s>
<s> Can you fix this crash or shall we change the Spanish es-amayamsg file?  </s>
<s> By the way, is Timelime or SVG Library or other new 7.X features documented somewhere?  </s>
<s> Best regards, Bartolom?  </s>

<s> I found the cause of the crash: the string was in ISO-8859-1and the function was supposed to manage UTF-8 strings.  </s>
<s> I'll fix the problem as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> SVG library is documented (see the entry Graphics in the help page), but the timeline not yet.  </s>
