<s> I successfully compiled amaya-2.1 on my linux system (libc5,XFree).  </s>
<s> However, it would not properly display the www.altavista.com  </s>
<s> page.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the search entry line was not correct.  </s>
<s> I also tried to compile amaya with --enable-plugin.  </s>
<s> It failed because the file "editplugin.c"  </s>
<s> tries to include the file "app.h", but that file does not exist in the include directory.  </s>
<s> There is a file called "application.h"  </s>
<s> there but substituting "application.h"  </s>
<s> for "app.h" did not work either.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your efforts.  </s>

<s> The Altavista home page has many HTML errors, one of which confuses the Amaya parser as to where is the end of the form.  </s>
<s> You can check them out with http://validator.w3.org/.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, you're right.  </s>
<s> It's been over one year since we last touched/tested the plugin code.  </s>
<s> We need to upgrade it so that it conforms to the current state of the Amaya code.  </s>

<s> We needed to rename the file app.h due to conflicts on Windows platforms and we forgot to update the file "editplugin.c".  </s>
<s> The new name is appstruct.h.  </s>
<s> This is the patch for the file "editplugin.c": - #include "struct.h"  </s>
<s> + #include "appstruct.h"  </s>
