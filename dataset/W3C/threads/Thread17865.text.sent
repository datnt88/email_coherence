WAI UA Telecon for April 19th, 2000 Chair: Jon Gunderson Date: Wednesday, April 19th Time: 2:00 pm to 3:30 pm Eastern Standard Time, USA Call-in:Longfellow Bridge (+1) (617) 252-1038 Agenda Review Action Items (see details at end of message) Announcements 1.April 27th, WCAG Telecon will be discussing markup to provide navigation information to user agents 2.Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standardsby the United States ARCHITECTURAL AND TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS COMPLIANCE BOARD. 
Comments will be accepted until May 30th Discussion 1.Update on proposed recommendation process 2.Issue #PR207: Interpretation checkpoint 2.1 Notes: A. Consensus on access to all human readible content through the user interface B. Consensus on access to all alternative equivalents through the user interface C. Currently the group has identified the primary use for access to machine readible content through the user interface is for repair purposes. 
The following items summarize the chairs view of the issue: C.1 We have previously removed other repair related checkpoints (linearization of tables, etc..). 
The only one left is Checkpoint 2.3. 
C.2 Examples sited affect people with disabilities the same as people without disabilities. 
Markup that does not conform to WCAG. 
C.3 Examples sited require an expert knowledge of markup for repair (small number of people with skill and motivation) C.4 Examples sited do not guarantee access to content only potential C.5 This would be a new requirement and may require stepping back to a previous stage in the recommendation process 3.PR#224: Checkpoint 4.16: Minimal conformance requirement unclear 4.PR#244: Checkpoint 4.5: Change to P2 since no reference implementation. 
5.PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed. 
6.PR#262: Checkpoint 5.9: Change Priority since non-standard approaches may be better. 
7.PR#264: Checkpoint 3.9: Raise priority since may cause CD problems. 
Open Action Items 1.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers. 
(No deadline.) 2.IJ: Propose three terms to the list: Document Source, Document Object and Rendered Content 3.IJ: The content/ui division in G1 needs to be fixed 4.IJ: Resolutions from FTF meeting 5.IJ: Adopt new wording of proposal for checkpoint 9.2 6.IJ: Propose split to the list. 
Identify why and issue of priority. 
7.CMN: Find out from I18N how to generalize the accessibility provided by sans-serif fonts. 
8.CMN: Propose a technique that explains how serialization plus navigation would suffice for Checkpoint 8.1. 
9.DA: Send name of new organization to list that was mentioned by some from the US Census Bureau 10.DA: Review techniques for Guidelines 7 and 8 11.DB: Get Tim Lacy to review G+ 12.DB: Review techniques for Guidelines 3, 4, and 11 13.DP: Review techniques for Guidelines 1 and 2 14.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples in the techniques document. 
15.GR: Review techniques for Sections 3.7 and 3.8 16.GR: Send to list screen shot of JFW Window list. 
17.JG: Write email to the list asking for information about which user groups require the ability to slow down presentations othewise access it impossible. 
18.JG: Take conformance grandulatity issue to the WAI CG. 19.JG: Identify the minimal requirement for each checkpoint. 
20.HB: Take scoping issue of the current guidelines to the EO working group 21.MQ: Review techniques for Guidelines 9 and 10 22.RS: Take notification of focus and view changes to PF as possible DOM 3 requirement.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Jon, Please add to the agenda an item about the UA Guidelines dependency on DOM Level 2. The DOM Working Group has been held up in their process of different interpretations of the XML namespaces Recommendation [1] by various XML Working Groups. 
Since it might be a while before DOM Level 2 advances to Proposed Recommendation, we might want to change our DOM requirements to DOM 1 so that we can move forward. 
Please note that if we make this change (which is significant, even if it's motived by a process issue, not a consensus issue), we may not be able to move directly to Recommendation. 
This would be the subject of the agenda item. 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 OK. 
I will add it to the agenda.

The problem with this analysis is simply this: The formats don't give you a machine-implemetable way to separate case A from case C. The only way the user agent can give access to all human-comprehensible information is to give structured (not all at once) access to the text values of all attributes. 
It's easier to do that than to try to filter on attribute. 
I realize that my view is colored by working most intensively with the talking book and supercomputing applications, but basic tree walking and property inspection is one small body of code for all nodes in the DOM tree. 
It takes more code to restrict it than to do it all. 
In order to minimize the burden on the User Agent, we need to lose the distinction between A and C which is not supported in the formats. 
Al I think to minimise the burden we should point out in the techniqeus that in general it is easier to implement this by making available everything through the user interface. 
It does also depend on the languages supported by the user agent - in some cases the range of information is so strictly tied that it may be simpler not ot.
