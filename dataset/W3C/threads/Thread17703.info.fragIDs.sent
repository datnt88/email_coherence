<s> They want to go to next list or to a sub list DA: The document tree structure is not what the user thinks about.  </s>
<s> SL: How does the user make choices about sub lists and next list items DA: Use a modified arrow option to go down a sub list SL: Notion of level may be a difficult concept for some users Changing levels is confusing KB: Seems like we are getting to a implementation model SL: One of the things I though use full, would be a system that would jump from block of text to block of text.  </s>

<s> KH: When you are creating pages I could use BR to make blocks.  </s>
<s> JG: What about an expanded a search function SL: Can their be a more abstract concepts, people do not understand structural elements We could caterize headers and elements in to units that people could understand DA: It does sort of makes sense, but people don't know element names SL: A more general concept DA: Move a page of text KH: The easiest way is use a page down to move a screen at a time, there may be a way to use page down to move an element at a time SL: A sighted person may look a pages, but they are looking a paragraphs KB: There are two issues: Speeding up moving through the pages and reading functional units.  </s>
