Keyboard group includes Denis Anson, Scott Luebking, Kathy Hewitt Next telecon will discuss table rendering and navigation. 
Kitch Barnicle: Requested future telecon topic on frames access Minutes 
JG: Announce the F2F after CTG conference Announced the weekly telecons DA: Navigating documents via the keyboard Concerned about third Document can be modeled as a tree, but most don't understand Arrow keys as navigation keys Meta keys used to define levels of document structure navigation People would JG: Selection and focus definitions Part of we is to define selection and focus DD: I don't think there is a need to provide more detail We all ready have keyboard Documentation should describe the model Plateform issues makes it difficult to specify certain keys JG: Hieracherical navigation DD: I think we should go beyond what we have SL: One of the things to focus on characters and words may conflict with screen readers. 
Users may want to use th DA: How can you navigate eefficiently using screen reader KB: We still have a blur between assistive technology and the browser SL: Additional aspect with the arrrow keys when navigating nested list. 
They want to go to next list or to a sub list DA: The document tree structure is not what the user thinks about. 
SL: How does the user make choices about sub lists and next list items DA: Use a modified arrow option to go down a sub list SL: Notion of level may be a difficult concept for some users Changing levels is confusing KB: Seems like we are getting to a implementation model SL: One of the things I though use full, would be a system that would jump from block of text to block of text. 
The screen reader has difficulty reading from block to block, but good at reading with in a block DA: Who defines what a block JG: There are block structure within HTML DD: There are in-line and block level elements. 
DA: What I would like to see, what is a block. 
If you had a large document, 
you may want to move through in big chunks. 
Move at the the level of interest, but all of the elements are visible. 
SL: Would people create such large document KB: We have a block level specification. 
DA: When you say expose the entire document If you display all the information there is context SL: A header followed by text that there would be greater context. 
KB: Concerned about consistancy KH: We are working on IE 5.0 we will have similar model as the current IE 4.0. 
I am looking a IE 6.0 keyboard model, using the Web TV model. 
Authors do not use HTML correctly. 
DA: Do we want to encourage correct design? 
KH: We need to encourage correct design, but also look at what people are actually doing SL: One way to look at it to see how people can access what is there. 
KH: When you are creating pages I could use BR to make blocks. 
JG: What about an expanded a search function SL: Can their be a more abstract concepts, people do not understand structural elements We could caterize headers and elements in to units that people could understand DA: It does sort of makes sense, but people don't know element names SL: A more general concept DA: Move a page of text KH: The easiest way is use a page down to move a screen at a time, there may be a way to use page down to move an element at a time SL: A sighted person may look a pages, but they are looking a paragraphs KB: There are two issues: Speeding up moving through the pages and reading functional units. 
When you jump, you lose context. 
DA: Need access not to just links, but also content SL: Some people just want to jump through the links, JG: Keyboard navigation Heircarchally Block by block Poor design DD: We have keyboard access, moving beyond to implementation SL: Keyboard access DA: I was not intending a specific implementation HB: Would like users to not need to learn a new navigation strategy for each ne browser SL: There may be no way around that.... HB: I would hate to navigate JG: We do not want to impose knowledge of HTML DA: Able bodied persons would use keyboard commands SL: Usability studies that keyboard is more efficient DA: Agree, we are not working on just a disability issue. 
We want to be transparent User agent be able to interpret commands from 3rd party assitive technology If the UA by passes standard operating system JG: We look see if have language I/O APIs Web TV interface Move block by block Search functions DA: we should pursue SL: As there any research on Web TV research KH: There probably is, I can followup SL: Count, moving by a count HB: If a list of 17 items, skip or move to? 
SL: I was thinking of relative KB: A user adjustable jump value JG: Action items Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign 1207 S.

Looking over the minutes, it seems as though we may have to come up with a model browser design to demonstrate the guidelines feasability.

Many of the features in the working draft have been implemented in one or more browsers, but there are some items that have not that would be good to demonstrate and test. 
Are you talking about a paper model or a working model.

correct, a paper. is there a development group within the w3c that could possibly produce a prototype something like amaya?

W3C WAI resources to my understanding are pretty thin for development work. 
We have in the past talked to the Amyia people about accessibility, that may be an avenue to explore.
