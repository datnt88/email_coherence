<s> My standard response to everyone who suggests that it is too complicated for a client to make sense of multiple source fields is: adopt the convention that the first link is the most important one, and just show that one.  </s>
<s> Some of the points made in the WebDAV thread against using headers to control what GET does:  </s>
<s> One very common mechanism for doing Web-based access control is to base the access control on the URL (i.e. what you can do to a resource depends on what the URL is).  </s>
<s> Using any header  </s>
<s> (such as the Translate header) breaks any scheme like this.  </s>
<s> When you do a COPY, should it go against the raw form or the processed form of the resource?  </s>
<s> Probably need the Translate header for that then too.  </s>
<s> Similarly for any other method that could reasonably be applied to both the raw and the processed form.  </s>
<s> So all that is needed is for the server to be able to dummy up some URL that means "the raw form of this resource" to avoid all these issues.  </s>
<s> That does not seem like an unreasonable burden on  </s>
<s> the server implementor.  </s>
<s> Similarly, I don't think it is an unreasonable burden on a client writer to do one extra roundtrip to retrieve a tree of source images (i.e. one Depth:infinity PROPFIND to retrieve all the links for a tree).  </s>

<s> Everthing else is nice-to-have, and may be very powerfull for some uses, but is obviously wrong for a simple: give me _this_ resource, untranslated.  </s>
<s> As for SimpleCMS, we could well use the both approaches for different reasons (we do not right now).  </s>
<s> Situation: every page is transformed on-the-fly, using a menu-module, and possible background, logo etc. resources.  </s>
<s> So, where should the source link(s) point to?  </s>
<s> The complete solution: - a raw version of the url in question and probably - a menu vonfig page, where the current menu style is choosen (or the menu program module??) - the background gif - the logo, if used - any sub-dir logos, if used - possible many more resources.  </s>
<s> - if it's a database generated pag: possible pointers to the raw table data, too.  </s>
<s> Very powerfull, potentially very usefull, but tell me: how should a network redirector like WebIFS show this mess to the user??  </s>
<s> Instead, the translate header would just say: give me _this_ url, untranslated.  </s>
<s> No questions what this means.  </s>
<s> One resource.  </s>
<s> No choice (no power, too :). Easy to realize, consistent with the file system model, and easy to explain to the user.  </s>
<s> So: source link are nice and powerfull and may be used for advanced purposes, but are simply not the same as translate.  </s>
<s> Use both.  </s>

<s> Our server currently supports the Translate header (because it's supported by Microsoft).  </s>
<s> However, experience shows that the way it's defined (or not defined, lacking any official documentation) I really problematic.  </s>
<s> For instance, PROPFIND currently will behave differently depending on the Translate header -- in the default case, the server will (try to) report the properties of the dynamic content (and in many case will fail to do so, for instance for the content length).  </s>
<s> This basically means that we're forcing clients to supply a proprietary and under-specified header to get at the 'real' (static) information.  </s>
<s> It seems that having different URLs for different things is the way to go, however, the DAV:source property should a) have better documentation, b) be easier to act upon by a user client (see proposal in [1]) Julian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001OctDec/0119.html  </s>
