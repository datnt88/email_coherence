Some weeks ago, I sent a question regarding the registration of charset "ISO_8859-15" to www-international@w3.org because I was (then) unable to find the address for this mailing list. 
Martin J. Du"rst has forwarded it to ietf-charsets@iana.org (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2000JanMar/0002.html). 
Did it ever reach this place? 
IANA's character set registry (http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets) still says: 
Name: ISO_8859-15 MIBenum: 
All the best, Paul Paul Langer e-mail Paul.Langer@softwareag.com 64297 Darmstadt 
Yes. AFAIK there was no followup, however. 
Name: ISO_8859-15 MIBenum: 
This is but one of many mistakes in the current database. 
I'm informed that work is underway to correct this and numerous other problems.

I was the guy who register that charset and was approved by IANA and the reviewer. 
So, it should be there.
