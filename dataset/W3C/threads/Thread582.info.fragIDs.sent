<s> Hi Tidyers, I need some help / advice please.  </s>
<s> TidyCom is a COM wrapper for HTML Tidy (this just means you can use Tidy  </s>
<s> from within programming languages for Windows) and it's based on the  </s>
<s> 2000-08-04 version of HTML Tidy.  </s>
<s> TidyCom is no longer being developed or maintained.  </s>
<s> I'm using TidyCom from dotnet's C# programming language and generally it works fine.  </s>
<s> However the 2000-08-04 version of Tidy does not implement the "repeated-attributes" option and this is something I now need as certain pages that my software must dynamically Tidy have several elements with repeated attributes in them.  </s>
<s> Is there another way of getting rid of these repeated attributes or getting rid of any section / element that contains them; it would be fine if -say- the entire element, that contains a repeated attribute, were to be just completely left out of the Tidied document?  </s>
<s> Is there an alternative to TidyCom?  </s>
<s> In other words some way of Tidying a html file from a programming language that allows me to output in xml.  </s>
<s> Why does the 2000-08-04 version of Tidy not output proper XML when you set "output-xml" to be true?  </s>
<s> Anyone who's interested can find TidyCom @ TidyCom: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyCOM/  </s>
<s> Many thanks and regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> My only thought is that it might not be much work to update TidyCOM with the current CVS at http://sf.net/projects/tidy/.  </s>
<s> I believe the diffs of the source files for the tidylib component of TidyCOM are small (diffs to 2000-08-04, that is).  </s>
<s> I would save those diffs in a separate file.  </s>
<s> Replace the tidylib sources from SourceForge and re-apply the changes.  </s>
<s> I think there are just a couple.  </s>
<s> At any rate, I did this once and it took an hour.  </s>
<s> hope this helps, Charlie  </s>
<s> Julian,  </s>
<s> You are welcome to my code but -at present- it just uses TidyCom.  </s>
<s> I now need Tidy options not implemented in TidyCom and so, over the next few days, I am going to try and sort this out, probably by converting JTidy source to C# using one of the utilities.  </s>
<s> You would be welcome to the code for this too.  </s>
<s> IMPORTANT: Are you running Visual Studio dotnet?  </s>
<s> Or just dotnet?  </s>
<s> Regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> Hi Matthew, Sorry to bother you, but I have just spotted your posting on the HtmlTidy mailing list.  </s>
<s> I need to use Tidy within a C# ASP.net app that I am creating and was wondering if you were willing to share your implementation code?  </s>
<s> I have looked briefly at TidyCom, but was concerned that it was an old build and that the developer was no longer developing it.  </s>
<s> If you are feeling generous...... Cheers, Julian Voelcker The Virtual World (UK) Limited Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> Wow. If you convert Tidy to C#, you would be my hero forever.  </s>
<s> :) But looking at the JTidy page, it *looks* like it's a port of the Aug. 2000 code.  </s>
<s> I also want the recent options.  </s>
<s> Does JTidy keep current with the ongoing tidy.sf.net development?  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Hi Matthew,  </s>
<s> I'm using VS.net - does that matter?  </s>
<s> That would be excellent if you did provide a copy of the code - have you thought about putting it on the sourceforge site for others to work on?  </s>
<s> My background is with ASP.old, but have been working with C# non stop since the beginning of the year and would be happy to help out if necessary.  </s>
<s> I also have a friend who co-authored some of the Wrox ASP.net books and is currently working on a book on developing server controls - he is very keen to use Tidy for an editor component he has written so may also be a valuable source of info.  </s>
<s> Do let me know what I can do to help.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker The Virtual World (UK) Limited Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> Because I'm not, I just have dotnet installed no VS.net.  </s>
<s> There is a VS.net utility called JUMP, still in beta, for VS.net (URL below) which converts Java to C#. I have no idea if it works well or not.  </s>
<s> If you'd be prepared to convert the JTidy source using JUMP I'll take the C# Jtidy code (lets call it CSTidy) and try to get it working.  </s>
<s> When it works I'll email you the code and we can make it publicly available via the Tidy/JTidy web pages.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> JUMP is @ Regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> No problem doing the conversion.  </s>
<s> I have downloaded the Addin for VS.net and the JTidy code, but cannot access the readme for the addin to work out how to use it.  </s>
<s> Can you get it from your end?  </s>
<s> I'll have a look, but what exactly do you want me to find.  </s>
<s> Just to warn you, I'm trying to merge the TidyCOM source with the latest Tidy source to get the latest options working from TidyCOM.  </s>
<s> If I succeed then the JTidy to C# will have to take the back burner till I have more time available - unless it's easy in which case I'll sort it out immediately.  </s>
<s> I am worried by Jelks's email to the mailing list, to refresh your memory Wow.  </s>
<s> If you convert Tidy to C#, you would be my hero forever.  </s>
<s> :) But looking at the JTidy page, it *looks* like it's a port of the Aug. 2000 code.  </s>
<s> I also want the recent options.  </s>
<s> Does JTidy keep current with the ongoing tidy.sf.net development?  </s>
<s> /Jelks If JTidy is not based on a later version of Tidy than TidyCom then there's little point in going ahead from my point of view.  </s>
<s> I need the latest options.  </s>
<s> Can you (or anyone) shed some light on this.  </s>
<s> BTW - Where are you?  </s>
<s> London.  </s>
<s> I haven't been to Cirencester in 10 years, but a good friend grew up near there and I used to stay with him and his family for weekends in the country, so I used to know the area a bit - I grew up in Oxford, not a 1,000,000 miles away.  </s>
<s> Thanks and regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> Julian, Many thanks for using JUMP to do the conversion of JTidy java source to C# and emailing me the files.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately JUMP does not seem capable of handling 'complex' Java programs.  </s>
<s> I compiled the C# code and got lots of errors, I was expecting this though.  </s>
<s> However the following message appeared 165 times in the converted code: "//UPGRADE_TODO: The equivalent in .NET for ... will be considered in a future release."  </s>
<s> This informs you that methods, expressions, classes, etc. have different behaviour in .net  </s>
<s> from Java or simply have no equivalent (EG.  </s>
<s> Java Beans) and that they may sort this out in a future release.  </s>
<s> On the up-side 142 of the errors are the same error and refer to a specific GetString() method.  </s>
<s> I will investigate how easily these 'errors' can be manually fixed and if I think I can do it, I'll give it a go.  </s>
<s> I'm also trying to update TidyCOM but have a few unresolved external symbol linking errors (the worst error as it doesn't show you very well where the problem occurs).  </s>
<s> At the moment updating TidyCOM seems the simplest option.  </s>
<s> By the way although I have no idea which version of Tidy JTidy is based on it seems to handle post TidyCOM options (EG.  </s>
<s> 'repeated_attribute', 'doctype').  </s>
<s> Which version of the JTidy source did you convert?  </s>
<s> You will be kept informed of my progress.  </s>
<s> I got back from a meeting to see both your request for my phone number and the source code, so assumed it was too late for the phone call.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for doing the JUMP conversion, I appreciate it.  </s>
<s> Regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> Thanks Matthew.  </s>
<s> One of things that came up in the conversion was that I had to setup the java files in a J++ project and then convert - I set it up as COM dll - I assume that was right.  </s>
<s> The JTidy source I used was based on the Aug 2000 version of Tidy, which should be the same as TidyCom.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you need me to do any more.  </s>
