I'd encourage all, but particularly those participating in the conference call this afternoon, to take a look at: This is a prototype of why and how one would create a dynamic set of accessibility guidelines in order to deal with the creation of both a practical present-day guidelines and optimistic guidelines for the future on which to base authoring tool and browser manufacturer specs. 
The implementation fleshes out many of the ideas I've mentioned in recent postings to this list (Subj: Re: Murky ratings). 
Josh Krieger CAST Hello Josh I think it's a very useful tool for people that have a special deliverable in mind as in "doing an accessible web site that is compliant with html3.2 and NS3". 
I've met people with this kind of deliverable, that's just web design shop market reality, but I'm not sure that's something I'd like to see W3C endorsing in a markup guideline normative document. 
For one thing, I wouldn't know which combination to choose for my own pages... 
I'm more in favor of W3C "raising the bar" and recommending guidelines based on standard, even if this means some of them will only take their full effect in the future. 
I am not sure the a goal of the page authoring guidelines should be creating a set of dynamic guidelines for public consumption. 
I think this will be vary confusing to novices. 
Is this tool intend just for internal WAI usage?

I think the idea of creating guidelines for Netscape 3.0 EM OR /EM Opera 3.2 or something else is a bit antithetical to the whole WAI. 
But the idea ofd a set of guidelines which can be dynamically interpreted is not a bad thing- especially for AT - for example it should be an AT thing not to have a BLINK or MARQUEE option available. 
In fact if UA's also failed to recognise the element then it would not be a problem any more. 
Charles McCathieNevile One of my goals in writing this tool was to try and begin viewing the guidelines as something more than a flat HTML file. 
There can be a great deal of data stored in each guideline that can help us to harness our work in creative ways. 
Maybe the interface I wrote obscures this. 
If so, I apologize. 
In the limiting case, by choosing "HTML 4.0" and "All ATs" the example would generate the current guidelines minus all interim issues. 
So in fact, if we so desired, we could generated a static document from a more general purpose mechanism for use as the formal WAI recommendation while still keeping very specific information about the ways in which each guideline is relevant. 
What if a person wants to see all the guidelines that are relevant to a hearing impaired audience first, or have the guidelines alternatively ranked based on how easy it is to fix them. 
All of these are needs which we currently have and unless we try and conceive of the guidelines as more than a flat document, I think we will have a hard time meeting our more fundamental goal of providing useful accessibility information to the varying needs of different authors.
