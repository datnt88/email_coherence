<s> Hi, I'm trying to add an annotation, and I always recieve this error, (or a variation on it it's always on the first Namespace mentioned.)  </s>
<s> p http://annotest.w3.org/annotations was unable to interpret parameter RDF xmlns: "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#" xmlns:d="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"  </s>
<s> Note the "xmlns: ", in the sent XML, I send "xmlns=" - The full RDF I send can be seen at http://jibbering.com/2002/2/annotea.rdf the only complaints of the RDF validator are the deprecated warnings that all annotea RDF seems to produce.  </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jim.  </s>
<s> Is the following supposed to be RDF/XML?  </s>
<s> earl:Assertor xmlns:earl="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" rdf:about="http://valet.webthing.com/page/"  </s>
<s> If so, note that the rdf:about attribute is not permitted on the root element - [6.1] of RDF/XML:  </s>

<s> Ah, a good point (I seem to have lost the root element of the RDF) however this shouldn't effect the Annotea, as this isn't being parsed by annotea, it's just being stored?  </s>
<s> Thanks for the heads up though.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> Just confirmed that correcting this oversight doesn't change the error from the Annotea server.  </s>
<s> correct submission.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jim.  </s>
<s> I previously reported [1] that, contrary to the Protocols page, an XML header appears to be needed on some messages.  </s>
<s> (I think the script sniffs for it before deciding what to do).  </s>
<s> As for weird errors, wait till you see "509 Protocol Vaguery"!  </s>

<s> Okay, with the help of Matthew Wilson, I've corrected that problem (it needs a PI) However I now have a new problem: If I add a Creator using the 1.1 DC namespace CHUMP- Annotea script at http://www.w3.org/2001/09/chump/ ) Annotea goes wrong generating a namespace prefix of 1.1 1.1:Creator  which my XML tools certainly can't deal with and don't appear to be valid.  </s>
<s> If I use the 1.0 namespace which Annotea uses internally (shouldn't it being using 1.1 anyway?) it all works okay.  </s>
<s> At a guess Annotea generates the namespace from the uri, which then goes wrong 'cos of the numbers.  </s>
<s> On a side note, here's a gentle reminder about the "application/xml+rdf" content type bug losing the + when returning it.  </s>
<s> (all of this is to do with Storing EARL in Annotea once again, this time from an IRC bot - which means I also have an IRC client for Annotations.) Cheers, Jim.  </s>
<s> Following a message from Jim's FillyJonk bot, I tried to open a URL to an annotation body.  </s>
<s> After entering my username and password, the server returns an entirely bogus redirection, to a pseudo-URL of a kind browsers will decode when encountered in HTML, but not in a Location: header.  </s>
<s> What is going on?  </s>
