On Monday's Teleconference we ran short of time before getting a chance to discuss the new draft of the Wombat Techniques. 
Please review the new draft, Jan and Matt have prepared at the following URI and send any feedback to the list by Tuesday, September 3. This way we can get a new draft prepared for the next meeting and continue the momentum the group has gained into the Face-to-Face in Vancouver: As you review the draft, please pay special attention to the following: - the splitting of the document by tier rather than by guideline - the placement of the "access to the tool" guideline first. 
- the comments throughout marked by red text with "@@" before and after. 
Thanks Jutta 
Hi, I am wondering if we need to renumber the guidelines and checkpoints for the tiers. 
I think there is some value in having continuity between the ATAG 1 guidelines and the Wombat ones, even if they are presented in a slightly different order. 
(The numbering is really a way to refer to them, and they don't necessarily have to be in order. 
It depends how easily confused tool developers are).

Hi, I agree that having to re-number the checkpoints from one version to another is a negative. 
But, the purpose of the re-numbering is really to help developers see how the different guidelines build on one another, which I believe is a positive. 
Anyhow, the group's decision to move the guideline on making the tool itself accessible to the front of the document already necessitates re-numbering, since starting the document with guideline 7 would be quite odd. 
Cheers, Jan
