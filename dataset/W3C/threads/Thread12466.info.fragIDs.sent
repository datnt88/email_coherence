<s> On Monday's Teleconference we ran short of time before getting a chance to discuss the new draft of the Wombat Techniques.  </s>
<s> Please review the new draft, Jan and Matt have prepared at the following URI and send any feedback to the list by Tuesday, September 3. This way we can get a new draft prepared for the next meeting and continue the momentum the group has gained into the Face-to-Face in Vancouver: As you review the draft, please pay special attention to the following: - the splitting of the document by tier rather than by guideline - the placement of the "access to the tool" guideline first.  </s>

<s> Hi, I am wondering if we need to renumber the guidelines and checkpoints for the tiers.  </s>
<s> I think there is some value in having continuity between the ATAG 1 guidelines and the Wombat ones, even if they are presented in a slightly different order.  </s>
<s> (The numbering is really a way to refer to them, and they don't necessarily have to be in order.  </s>
<s> It depends how easily confused tool developers are).  </s>

<s> Hi, I agree that having to re-number the checkpoints from one version to another is a negative.  </s>
<s> But, the purpose of the re-numbering is really to help developers see how the different guidelines build on one another, which I believe is a positive.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, the group's decision to move the guideline on making the tool itself accessible to the front of the document already necessitates re-numbering, since starting the document with guideline 7 would be quite odd.  </s>
