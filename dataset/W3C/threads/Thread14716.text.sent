If we organized our checkpoints into a database, we could provide multiple views of them. 
Here are some examples: 1. 
The current presentation | interaction | comprehension | technology view. 
2. An access | navigation | comprehension view. 
3. A content | structure | presentation view. 
4. A view organized by difficulty: difficult - easy. 5. A view organized by affected group: visual | aural | cognitive | motor | etc. 6. 
A view organized by priorities: P1 | P2 | P3 7. By sequence: first - last (assuming some build upon others) 8. By skill necessary to conform: textual | musical | visual art | etc. 9. By relationship to WCAG 1.0 guidelines. 
And so on. 
Maybe users could make up their own. 
We could, if W3C insists, make one of these the "normative" (default) view. 
As Gregg points out, it would have to include all checkpoints in some sort of linear fashion. 
Frankly, I'm leaning toward the idea that the guidelines are different from other specifications and that perhaps one of the problems with WCAG 1.0 is that it is a bit too specification-like. 
For one thing, I think that making the guidelines too much like regulations leads people to think about them in regulatory terms (including the government). 
I'm not sure that that worked so well. 
Section 508 might have been better if they'd started from scratch. 
I guess we'd have to change the WG charter if we wanted to drop the normative view entirely. 
Still, I'm open to anything. 
I want effective guidelines. 
If our charter has become a straightjacket, I'd rather modify it than produce mediocre guidelines.

Munat Hence the mantra "author proposes, user disposes". 
If the user of the GL isn't as empowered by their presentation as the output we call upon authors to provide, I'll need another entry in the sig line below! 
As in "each checkpoint that flaunts its own requirements..." Perhaps CP 3.4 could be "prepare textual manifestations with irreducibly transparentized obfuscation methodologies and maximize their lack of extraneous containments by means of minimilizations"? 
Love. 
EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY Perhaps WCAG could include something like the following guide to writing "proper" English:- Now you know where I get my little idioms from :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .
