Two questions: 1. 
When I start a new document, it does something like HOME_PAGE\New.html. 
First, why does it have a \ instead of / since most web protocols use \? 
Second, is there a way to change the New.html to something like UserName.html? 
2. When I open a new document, it opens another window, the same with Help selections, is there a way to have this all come in the same window. 
I tried changing IN_NEW_WINDOW in New ()to false but it didn't seem to have any effect. 
Thanks for the help, David Where is this \ generated? 
It seems like it would be easy to change, no? David Behalf Of Irene.Vatton@inrialpes.fr

HOME_PAGE\New.html. 
There was a bug in the Windows 2.4 version. 
Amaya generated always a \ even if the URI was a Web address. 
Help If you call InitDocView (CurrentDocument, ....) instead of InitDocView (0, in the function InitializeNewDoc, it should display the new document in the same window.

New.html comes from the global variable DocumentName. 
This variable is intialized in Amaya\amaya\init.c and you can change its intial value by whatever you want. 
I'm not sure that I understood well your question but you may have a new window if you asked for or if the current document is modified. 
Otherwise and exept for Help, new docs are displyed in the same window.
