<s> According to BearHeart / Bill Weinman:  </s>
<s> These are just a couple of instances of a whole class of potential problems associated with a design decision for some server implementations.  </s>
<s> Most (but not all) server implementations treat the path part of a requested URL as a file system path and make the default action to serve that file unless it is somehow explicitly forbidden.  </s>
<s> This is the reason that /../ is problematic and that it is necessary to pay so much attention keeping the server restricted to its data hierarchy.  </s>
<s> It is also the reason that minor bugs so often turn into security problems (e.g. the NCSA bug that caused a "cgi-bin//" in a URL to be treated as a path but not to a cgi-bin and hence to allow the serving of script sources).  </s>
<s> It is also the reason that .htaccess files get served.  </s>
<s> They seem especially problematic since you can't set permissions on .htaccess  </s>
<s> files to make them unreadable by the server.  </s>
<s> There are still more examples, like viewing CGI sources by requesting foo.cgi~ in a directory where foo.cgi lives.  </s>
<s> And there are almost surely other problems we aren't yet aware of.  </s>
<s> In my view these all stem from taking a (potentially hostile) request from a user and by default serving it unless it is somehow explicitly forbidden.  </s>
<s> I am  </s>
<s> all for warnings it the HTTP specification, but it is not very realistic to think that any collection of warnings will really remedy the situation.  </s>
<s> You simply can't warn against all the possible risks associated with this design.  </s>

<s> As an addition, it should go to the mailing list first (also, I think it applies equally to 1.0).  </s>
<s> I would suggest a few changes (in the latter half):  </s>
<s> On such a system, an HTTP server must disallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server.  </s>
<s> Similarly, files intended for reference only internally to the server (such as access control files, configuration files, and script code) must be protected from inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive information.  </s>
<s> Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server implementations have turned into security risks.  </s>
<s> ...Roy T. Fielding Department of Information &amp; Computer Science (fielding@ics.uci.edu)  </s>
<s> That's why I suggested language that would suggest that the server have a configuration option for the sysadmin to specify wild-cards that would protect against classes of files:  </s>
<s> That way, I could have entries like this in my access.conf  </s>
<s> file: order allow,deny allow from all deny files "..*" deny files ".*" deny files "*.cgi" deny files "nph-*" Currently, I have a server that I'm planning to put on the net.  </s>
<s> I am the only user on the system so I didn't see any particular risk in having local ACFs in the filesystem until I realized that they could be retrieved by a GET.  </s>
<s> If I could restrict them as I've shown here, I would be able to use them.  </s>

<s> For the 'security considerations' portion of the 1.1 draft, with your concurrence:  </s>
<s> I like the wording here "outside those intended to be accessible", as that is more general than what I had suggested.  </s>
<s> I would also like to see some suggestion that the sysadmin be able to specify what is and is not "intended to be accessible".  </s>
<s> Unix, in particlar, is flexible enough that a sysadmin may have non-standard filenames for sensitive files.  </s>
<s> Some do this as an added security precaution.  </s>
<s> This language was in the paragraph that I had suggested earlier: + A server should + make a configuration option available to the system administrator to + ensure that this protection is made sufficiently flexible for + site-specific security considerations.  </s>
