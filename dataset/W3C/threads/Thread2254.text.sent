Those arguing for the IETF enacting social policy have said that one of the problem with cookies as they exist now is that, sure, browsers allow you to selectively not receive cookies but you get pounded by warnings for every single cookie you don't receive. 
The social engineers don't like this behavior so they have decided to use their IETF stick to beat browser makers into acting the way they want. 
I won't even sideline into the question of what happened to the free market and the right to use other products. 
I suppose we can all look forward to a small group of academics using standards to force products to work the way they want from now on. 
Say goodbye to GUI and hello to command lines! 
I can't wait until the requirement "Your product must not crash, EVER, ohh and yeah, it has to run on LINUX." 
Is it just me or is this all getting way to close to a Dilbert cartoon? 
So, now, with the mighty standard bashing into the heads of browser makers, exactly what sort of dialog do the social engineers think will go up to the average user the first time they hit an "unverified" transaction? 
What response do you think 99% of the users out there will click? 
Oh yeah, gee, I forget, we all win because the user has a choice. 
After all users are clearly being brainwashed by the Evil Media (TM) and therefore must be saved from their own product choices. 
I figure I should just relax and let it ride. 
After all, the reality of the spec was decided before the last call was ever taken. 
Of course, that is just my opinion, I could be wrong, Yaron PS The reason I let this rant get posted to the list is because I strongly believe that it accurately reflects the feelings of a significant number of people. 
If the IETF would continue being relevant it had better at least consider what those people are feeling and why. 
That doesn't necessarily mean that it has to change what it has done w/the cookie spec but it does mean that there is a problem and it is in everybody's interest that it be addressed.

Despite what is implied above, many ad delivery implementations currently "require" cookies to function correctly (e.g., sequence, impression link). 
If the major browser vendors support this new standard as well as they support the old standard we don't have to worry about cookie support going away for a very long time ;- thank you drive through Gregory A.

Hendrix Yaron, Please save your ranting for alt.bash.evil-empire. 
If we weren't engaged in social engineering, we wouldn't have a requirement for a "security considerations" section. 
You are completely free to implement whatever the market lets you get away with implementing, and the IETF has no way to control it. 
It's only if you want the IETF as whole to endorse the protocol that you want to implement as an "internet standard" that you have to put up with the pain of actually considering those things which are established as IETF priorities. 
This does not include "Your product must not crash, EVER, ohh and yeah, it has to run on LINUX" (although neither of those would be bad ideas), but it does include being careful to consider the issues of security, privacy, effect on the overall operation of the internet, internationalization, even when those are not clearly within your current short-term market horizin. 
No one has anything with which to bash the head of any browser maker. 
This is a consensus process. 
If the browser makers don't go along, well, then we can have either a different standard or no standard. 
It's really up to you. 
But this is not a free-market economy model, winner-take-all. 
This is a consensus model. 
Convince us that you're right. 
Ranting is not a useful method of convincing anyone. 
The WG *does* make every *reasonable* attempt to hear all sides. 
That is what is meant when the phrase 'rough consensus' is used. 
The wg meetings and mailing lists are well known. 
Interested parties are obligated to put forth their opinions. 
The wg cannot seek out every individual or organization who 'might' have an opinion. 
The fact that up until right now, it seemed that the draft might move forward with a consensus. 
Why is it that right at the wire ( no pun intended ) this has blown up again. 
Its the same issues that have been discussed at length before, many times. 
Obviously the rough in 'rough consensus' leads one to beleive that not everyone will be happy with everything, thats not possible. 
But the draft should move forward on consensus, not based on who shouts the loudest. 
In any event, time would be better spent writing a specific alternative proposal for review, then a self proclaimed rant. 
If so many people feel that way, they should write a draft that expresses their views. 
The chair has graciously invited you to create one for consideration. 
BTW, I would like to make it clear that I speak for myself, not Microsoft. 
The opinions I express are mine and mine alone. 
The postings I have been putting out are strictly a reflection of my deep concern about the damage I believe the cookie spec is doing to the IETF. 
Ill avoid restating my disclamer, but it applies equally. 
On 'what the cookie spec is doing to the IETF', I dont see it as being quite so dramatic. 
The wg's charter is to generate and propose standards based on a consensus of opinion from a wide base of representation. 
It has done so with many drafts. 
In this case, IMHO, a few (though quite big), organizations have misinterpreted the spirit of the draft. 
Now the wg is modifying the draft to better express the spirit of that consensus. 
I dont see that as damaging to the IETF. 
I beleive that the spirit or intent of the wg consensus is more important than the words on paper in a spec.
