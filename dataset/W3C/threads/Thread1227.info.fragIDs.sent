<s> Hi, I sent a request to register iso-8859-14 about a year ago.  </s>
<s> What happened with it?  </s>
<s> Kind regards Keld Simonsen  </s>
<s> And I thought I'd approved it, but can't find the original request at the moment.  </s>
<s> could you resend the registration data?  </s>

<s> When did the address for this mailing list change?  </s>
<s> --Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium  </s>
<s> It hasn't changed in many years.  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
<s> It appears to have.  </s>
<s> The recent messages are from ietf-charsets@innosoft.com; earlier ones were to ietf-charsets@iana.org.  </s>
<s> The IANA address is no longer valid, and Majordomo at IANA says no such list for subscription requests.  </s>
<s> --Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium  </s>
<s> Again, the list has always been ietf-charsets@innosoft.com.  </s>
<s> IANA has in the past maintained a forwarding address that redirects mail to the real list.  </s>
<s> AFAIK IANA has never maintained a charsets list.  </s>
<s> The former should be taken up with IANA; the latter is expected since the list is not and never has been a Majordomo list run by IANA.  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
