I had wanted to have a reasonably quick read of all of it - but the sheer length has defeated me. 
This is of course a very useful document, but it would be better if it were a lot shorter. 
Minimally I think there should be some clear way to print out 10 or 15 pages that is enough to get started with RDF. 
I think however much pruning the editors do, I believe the primer will benefit from being a multi-page document. 
One of the pages should be Quick Start. 
(This point above is not critical to this release). 
Some more detailed comments: (I have not looked at anyone else reviews yet, so there will be duplicates). 
Abstract: much too long. 
An abstract is a summary of the entire document, not a repeat of the introduction. 
Suggest: 1st sentence. 
"RDF can be used to represent information both about things that can be retrieved from the Web, and about things that can be identified on the Web but not retrieved. 
RDF provides a common framework for expressing information so it can be excahnged between applications without loss of meaning." 
Last two sentences.

(note use of 2nd person is hard to translate consider phrasing) [[strongly-suggest-delete: While nearly every other part ... the Web together.]] 
[[suggest-delete: Since the URI is such a ... anything, it should not be surprising that]] ... has no physical [[suggest-replace:virtual]] existence on the ... ... how RDF statements can be [[suggest-delete: physically]] represented and exchanged. 
2.2 suggest move into appendix, in multi-document ... So additional mechanisms [[strongly-suggest-replace: must be // are ]] provided ... Last para 2.2, keep in main body of doc. 
2.4 a way after figure 5 ... renaming their node identifiers [[suggest-delete: are considered to]] represent ... 2.5 after Figure 9 [[strongly-suggest-delete-a-large-chunk: RDF datatype concepts borrow a ...

hope this helps. 
We (the WG) have a serious problem with too much material. 
I suspect that Brian will be the only one of us sufficiently dedicated to read every page this time round. 
We do the community a disservice if we do not select the best material, and either downgrade or ditch the rest. 
One possible downgrade path would be to produce a book (RDF: the definitive guide - a load of WG names) after having produced a shorter set of specs - we might even make a buck or two. 
Jeremy Jeremy (and Steve, and Dan, and Dave, and Patrick, and most of all, Brian; did I leave anyone out?)-- 
Thanks for the comments. 
As you might imagine, I have not actually implemented changes responding to everyone's comments yet. 
I've been mostly working through Brian's comments, plus some additional work I'd been doing already (like synching the names of documents and the references). 
In the process, I have addressed a number of other folk's comments as well. 
I have, in particular, already made changes corresponding to the "critical" comments I've received, in particular: * changes to the typed literal section (2.6) as requested by Patrick and Brian * removing section 4.3.3 (RDF in HTML) as requested by DanC * removing section 6.4 (intelligent routing) as requested by Brian and DanC * removing some material in the section on containers as requested by Brian I will have to get to the other comments (particularly the more extensive ones like making separate pages or Appendices of sections 2.1 and 2.2) later. 
I do have one specific question right now for Jeremy: Do you mean the reference to RDF/XML, or the material on QNames?
