<s> People have reacted quite positively to the contents of the XML-link draft.  </s>
<s> However, the work is *very* far from finished, and July 1st is galloping toward us.  </s>
<s> This is a first response, and written from the point of view of an implementer.  </s>
<s> (Much of XML-LINK is already in JUMBO, but rather kludgy in places, because when you don't know where you're going, it's tricky to plan :-).  </s>
<s> However I'm doing a rewrite and things should be a lot simpler.  </s>
<s> There is no intention to have a fully compliant JUMBO by July 1, but I hope it's possible to make fairly accurate pronouncements on the likelihood of the spec (a) being interpreted identically by implementers and (b) being implemntable at a few weeks of MCSG97.) As a baseline I am even more convinced that we need an application-independent post-parser (pre-application).  </s>
<s> There are a lot of implied semantics in XML-LINK and a considerable amount of syntax which (IMO) requires validation.  </s>
<s> I've posted this before so won't elaborate, but an example is that an EXTENDED element can only contain #PCDATA and LOCATOR.  </s>
<s> (Agreed, the DTD can be written to require this, BUT we have to cater for WF documents as well - do they have to obey this syntactic requirement).  </s>
<s> My opinion is that there are some tricky issues about how WF documents should/may/must behave under XML-LINK and these need addressing.  </s>
<s> The first decision is whether they require the same level of syntactic and semantic validation as validatable documents - I have no strong opinion (yet).  </s>
<s> I also feel that XML-LINK is so powerful that it opens up a wealth of new applications.  </s>
<s> Therefore I think it's important that (say) the design of XLG allows for a 'document' to be a generic node in any data structure and that limiting its use by analogy with printed documents is too restrictive.  </s>
<s> The next few messages describe a bunch of open issues in XML-Link that we need input on if we are to make our deadline.  </s>
<s> I have no views on the syntax of L1 (HERE).  </s>
<s> JUMBO can be hacked to accommodate it whatever the solution.  </s>
<s> However I suspect that XML-LINK will start to generate a set of KEYWORDs, reserved words or whatever, and that this will have to be addressed soonish.  </s>
<s> I shall comment on how JUMBO sees issues L2-6 in separate postings.  </s>
<s> Most are paryially implemented.  </s>
<s> In general I think XML-LINK is implementable.  </s>
<s> Until we start to see implementations widely I suspect there may be hidden problems - I've flagged the ones I can see, of course.  </s>
<s> That may mean another iteration and I suspect we have to face up to that possibility.  </s>

<s> I am the co-editor with Martin Bryan of the Topic Navigation Map ISO standard (ISO 13250), which is the continuation of an effort of modeling done under the auspices of the CApH (Conventions for the Application of HyTime) and the Davenport Group.  </s>
<s> Topic Navigation Maps give to the users the possibility to structure and control navigation strategies, and they can be used to emulate (and simplify) the traditional paper-based navigational tools, such as indexes, glossaries, thesauri and cross-references.  </s>
<s> Topic Navigation Maps are views on information that are intended to be interchanged and merged for Web-based information publishing and retrieval.  </s>
<s> The extended link definition, as proposed for XML, contains the mechanism that we need for Topic Navigation Maps, i.e. the possibility to address information from outside.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it will be possible to describe a significant subset of the Topic Map Architecture using XML links.  </s>
<s> This will hopefully be an important application for XML links.  </s>
<s> Topic Maps are formally described as an application of HyTime, and we are now working on the syntax necessary to make XML links and HyTime links (1997 version, to be published soon) work together.  </s>
