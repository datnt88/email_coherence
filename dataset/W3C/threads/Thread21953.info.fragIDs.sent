Are really WWW collaboration and WWW annotation two different work items? 
The natural way to add annotations to a web page seems to me to be to add a discussion to the web page (or to a place inside the web page). 
In that way, other people can comment on your 
annotation. 
Thus, annotations should use WWW collaboration tools, and one important application of WWW collaboration tolls is annotations!

Hello Jacob, 
In this case, annotation refers to a more specific type of collaboration. 
The annotation working group has been discussing annotations as documents or objects which reference or annotate other documents or objects (including other annotations). 
You can learn more about annotations in this context through the annotation working group web page at 
The www-annotation mailing list is intended for the discussion of annotations as originally put forth by the annotation working group, while the www-collaboration mailing list is intended as a more general discussion to cover all other kinds of collaboration technology and tools.

I've been thinking that annotation is but a special case of metadata. 
Just another object containing data that describe an object. 
If we were to wave a 
magic wand to whisk away the problems of addressing annotations to a version and/or partial-object (byte ranges, etc), an annotation server could use the same interface to list annotations as it would for more general forms of metadata on objects it served.

Well during last year's W3C meeting on the subject, annotation was a form of collaboration. 
Annotation is not necesarily shared. 
Private annotations have some value external to the more general issues of collaboration. 
I think in the original discussion, annotations were viewed as commentary on content not owned or controlled by the annotator. 
The technical issues I see are the correlation between arbitrary content in all its various complex forms. 
Once the annotation is created in the context of a collaboration support system, I would expect a bit more structure and control which would leave annotations as just one form of collaborative comment which should have the full power of the Collab system to support general discussion. 
Of course, since we are at the instant talking about a web deployed collaboration support system, it could also be the target of annotations of arbitrary material. 
I believe this one way connection to arbitrary material is what distinguishes annotations from general discussion. 
The arbitrary connection is probably not the most effective way to comment within a collaborative support system. 
Two examples of private annotation in current products may be found in the Quarterdeck WWW browser and in ZooWorks. 
Both allow users to make private notes to themselves. 
Useful and necessary in a group support context and also not sufficient for the full power of group collaboration.

I still do not see the difference. 
Why cannot a discussion be an annotation, with reference to another document or to some specific word, sentence, paragraph or section of another document? 
Why cannot an annotation be extended into a discussion between several people, if more than one person has something to contribute to the annotation?

There are personal annotations and group annotations. 
In general there are several types of annotations. 
During the life cycle of an information resource, the type of an annotation will likely change. 
You can adopt the content model (if you feel comfortable with it) where every piece of displayable, consumable media is a form of annotation. 
Then you've got atomic anotations (eg HTML pages) and composite annotation sets. 
Either way, the topic of annotation and collaboration are bound together, yet are independant of each other in several important ways. 
There is no more inherant a binding between annotations and collaboration then there is between collaboration and images. 
Some times the collaborative work group may want to discuss either. 
There may be a collaborative annotation type as the interface between the models.

Jacob, Just a caution....instead of getting in to the negative cycle of definitions why don't you propose what you want to work on. 
The working groups were setup not as debating circles, but to see if we could do some "work" together. 
So, want to propose a definition for annotation (or whatever it is you want to work on) that you like and talk about reference implementations, and how to get there.
