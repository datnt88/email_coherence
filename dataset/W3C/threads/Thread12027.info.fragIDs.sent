<s> I am against the change.  </s>
<s> The goal is that authors will create accessible content.  </s>
<s> That could be broken into several pieces, such as authors can create accessible content (there are plenty of tools which have yet to meet that goal), authors are assisted to make accesible content (there are lots of tools that need to achieve that goal), authors are encouraged to make accessible content (There are a couple of tools that have approached this one), authors are assisted, encouraged and helped to repair accessibility problems in existing content, etc.  </s>
<s> I think that splitting this out sends us back to the complexity that we are trying to avoid in the definitions of priority.  </s>
<s> At a more fundamental level, if authors are not more likely to create accessible content than inaccessible content then it would seem to me that the tool does not help the accessibility of the web.  </s>

<s> To avoid this "issue", the two goals might be worded as follows: GOALS: 1) Creating accessible authoring tools 2) Ensuring that authors produce accessible content Or something that avoids "can" or "will".  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I would be happy with "The authoring tool creates accesible content".  </s>
<s> The goal is that all content produced by authoring tools is accessible.  </s>
<s> Control  </s>
<s> over the user in order to acheive this is something the group has explicitly rejected.  </s>
<s> The teleconference following the face to face meeting made a  </s>
<s> resolution to that effect.  </s>
<s> This means that a tool can allow the creation of inaccessible content and still be conformant (even to triple-A) so long as it doesn't encourage the user to make inaccessible content instead of accessible content.  </s>
<s> I assume that allowing saves to inaccessible formats, and documenting how to do that, does not contravene a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> 2.3.4 in the new draft (which I will announce in a moment) is the checkpoint that needs to be considered most carefuly in relation to this issue I suspect.  </s>
<s> (So I think you are reading to much into the meaning of a goal.  </s>
<s> It is something less than an absolute requirement.) cheers Charles McCN I take the word "will" to mean the tool must ALWAYS create accessible content.  </s>

<s> If  </s>
<s> I want to create inaccessible pages now I just get one of the existing products that does it (I can give a few good recommendations if you are really keen *grin*).  </s>
<s> I have a problem with requiring that it is impossible, since that would be a restriction that also served to stifle innovation for the better.  </s>
<s> Besides, the goal is to put your accessible design classes into a new league, where you don't have to deal with code examples and can spend the time on the more complex aspects of equivalent alternatives, choices of accessible and more accessible techniques.  </s>
<s> (And eventually to put us out of jobs, because accessibility is simply part of everyday design.  </s>
<s> One day...) So I think the goal is that authors will create accessible content.  </s>
<s> There are things that are critical to meeting that goal.  </s>
<s> But even with all the pieces in place, it is possible to create inaccessible content if you want to.  </s>

<s> I prefer Ian's wording to the use of "can."  </s>
<s> Can implies that if there is any way the author can create accessible content then we have met our goal.  </s>
<s> I do not like goal statements that only refer to what the tool produces.  </s>
<s> The goal statement needs to address both what the tool produces automatically or without explicit intervention by the author and the process of persuading and helping the author to practice accessible authoring.  </s>
<s> The benefits of the second part go beyond the single document produced.  </s>
<s> If the second part is done properly it will both educate and produce accessible authoring habits in the author.  </s>
