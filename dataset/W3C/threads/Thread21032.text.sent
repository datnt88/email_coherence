I'd like to start collecting material for the W3C collaboration/annotation web site. 
If people send me pointers to their research, perhaps with a short abstract, I'll start putting them together and forward it to Dan LaLiberte at W3C. We've had some good discussions on this list, and it would be great to be able to point people to the web site for a broad survey of what everyone's been working on. 
Thank you for your contributions! 
Cheers, Karen MacArthur I personally think letting people update the page is a good idea, but it is up to the current contact for w3c collaboration and annotation projects, Daniel LaLiberte. 
He can be reached as laliberte@w3.org . 
-rolf But we should really need to put the work in on updating the annotations web page. 
(http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/ -- though there is much overlap, do these two areas still go together?) Yes, http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/ is severely out of date; unfortunately, i can't tell who maintains it nowadays, as the original author, Karen MacArthur, no longer seems to have an account at the W3C. 
Does anyone know who we should talk to? 
This is Karen MacArthur, and yes, I haven't worked at W3C since 1996 and so no longer maintain that page. 
I still follow the annotation list, however, and would be glad to contribute if W3C provides access or a new home is found. 
I can't find a current policy on collaboration and annotation on the W3C site. 
Can someone from W3C enlighten us on current activity, and on whom we should contact? 
Cheers, Karen Hi Karen My colleague Philip Rutherford and I have been working on implementing annotation systems for several years, originally in education but now through our company Weborganic. 
We have just released a beta version of PageSeeder which uses a method of dropping annotation points (seeds) into pages which can then receive and display messages. 
We have combined this with a list for groups which can be created of people interested in new comments on a page, so that they can keep up to date with new annotations through email. 
We have written various papers and they are accessible at our site as well as full information about our approach and a downloadable beta version. 
We are using our own system to manage our site, and especially the mailout that we are doing at present to let people know about us. 
Anyone who wishes can register on one of our groups to receive the updates. 
It's great that you are taking on this job, we have been working in isolation for some time, and we are more than ready to get some feedback on our approach to this.

Sydney, Australia Hello, Karen. 
Thanks very much for doing this. 
I guess i'll contribute the reference to the Crit project. 
CritLink is an open-source project that permits annotations to be made on any phrase in any web page by any user using any browser. 
The service and the source code have been available since July 1997. 
No software needs to be installed in order to use Crit; rather, Crit applies a mediator architecture to make this annotation capability accessible to any form-capable client. 
Anybody can use the public service at http://crit.org/; the software is provided just so that anyone wanting to run their own private Crit service can do so (for example, on a company intranet). 
Annotations in CritLink are first-class web documents that can be themselves annotated, permitting discussion threads to spring up anywhere. 
This also means that annotations can be stored publicly or privately on any website and password-protected if necessary, using exactly the same mechanisms as for any web page. 
In addition, as a side benefit of the way annotations are connected to their target with normal HTML links, CritLink permits the discovery of existing backward links from pages it has seen. 
Users can ask CritLink to monitor pages for new links and get notification in e-mail when a new backward link is found, whether it is a normal "coarse-grained" link or an annotation on the page being monitored. 
To use Crit, simply visit http://crit.org. 
The documentation and source code are also available at that site.
