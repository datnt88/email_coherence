From the HTML4 dtd Thus, the only element that can occur inside an ol /ol or ul /ul pair is an li . 
Fortunately, an ol /ol or ul /ul can appear inside an li . 
So all you need to do to nest lists you need to rearrange your end tags a bit: Kent Kent E. Holsinger Kent@Darwin.EEB.UConn.Edu -- Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology -- University of Connecticut, U-43 -- Storrs, CT 06269-3043 
Tidy is correct as OL and UL only permit LI as direct children. 
Tidy corrects: to li The basics which is fine.
