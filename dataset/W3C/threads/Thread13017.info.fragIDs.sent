<s> EOWG: Reminder, meeting today 19 October 2001: Time: 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.  </s>
<s> US Eastern Daylight Time Bridge: +1 617 252 7000 Minutes from last week are available at Agenda: 1. Outreach updates  </s>
<s> 2. Merged implementation plan outline  </s>
<s> I was not sure I would be able to put out a merged draft before today's meeting, but here it is, in incomplete draft form.  </s>
<s> Much detail for specific contexts to be added still.  </s>
<s> This incorporates some but not all of our requested changes, and  </s>
<s> visually it needs lots of work.  </s>
<s> We should discuss: - how effective is the merged outline approach?  </s>
<s> - what level of additional detail is essential to supplement this list?  </s>
<s> - is the split (away from the business case umbrella page) effective?  </s>
<s> - what specifics should be added to illustrate specific contexts?  </s>
<s> - how much more work is needed on this before sending it around for review?  </s>
<s> Note that this rolls together information, though not completely yet, from previous drafts In addition please recall our discussion of splitting the business and implementation sides, from August 3. Review &amp; discussion of replies on wai-eo-editors archive.  </s>
<s> Note again: Upcoming meeting dates/times are posted on EOWG home page including a link to Daylight Saving Time change-overs in different countries since there are often a few weeks at the end of October when we get out of sync with each other, given that DST change-overs occur at different times in different countries.  </s>

<s> Outreach update: Gave a presentation to the British Computer Society's Data Management subgroup, primarily on the Semantic Web, but also looking at accessibility applications of it.  </s>
<s> A general note about the implementation plan.  </s>
<s> It would benefit greatly  </s>
<s> (IMO) from a narrative about how MicroSoft went about it plus one from a much smaller place (a school in the Netherlands, perhaps) did its implementation.  </s>
<s> You've been fairly close to the process as MS went from a "commitment" by its leader through the present and maybe one of our Dutch pals has something from there?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> The last two H2s might be combined ("monitor" and "followup") I still don't think that setting a policy belongs herein - i.e. it's not "implementation" of such a policy, but the creation thereof.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
