Thanks for your message, Joseph. 
Here are my comments. 
"I'll note this as more evidence that p3p:PURPOSE is likely to be a part of the vocabularly most likely to change. 
However, I'm thinking it will be useful to distinguish the meta "purpose" of "current" and "other" from the other terms. 
I expect you'd want to user both of those terms independent of the others...?" Yes, I do. 
In such a loosely coupled Web services execution environment, I am thinking whether we should have a general dictationary for p3p:PURPOSE (e.g., "current" and "other") and also some application-specific dictationaries (e.g., financial applications) for p3p:PURPOSE in different scenarios? 
"I haven't made an attempt at it yet -- has anyone else? -- but I hope to soon. 
However, even without doing so, I ask myself if: 1. 
Does the privacy statement belong at the SOAP level, or HTTP? 
In the majority of cases SOAP will be transported over HTTP, what happens if both of a HTTP statement?" 
I would expect that we may have to have P3P statements at both the HTTP (if applicable) and SOAP level. 
At the HTTP level, the P3P statements should work and behave the same as described in the original P3P Specification for the Web sites. 
At the SOAP level, the P3P statements should be on both general and application-oriented semantics (it may be hard). 
What do you think? 
"This is an interesting point, if the web service client isn't a web browser, it might not support cookies anyway. 
However, I don't think we can presume this just yet. 
Might be worth a few setences on the point." 
For your information, you can even send a SOAP message by a plain text e-mail message as long as the Web service can interpret e-mail message like those mailing list server (e.g., subscribe). 
"  2. Does the privacy statement belong at the WSDL level? 
Not every service must have a service description. 
And if they did for the purposes of privacy then *have* to fetch the WSDL before proceeding with the interaction? 
My sense here is that SOAP would trump the OPTIONAL WSDL definition. 
Referring to the first question, do we need separate P3P (privacy) policies for each operation (web method) in a Web service? 
Then, for the second question, it may be closely related to the matchmaking process between Web service requestors and providers. 
Oh, good point. 
I'll add this as an issue to the outline I'm working on." 
As WS-Policy is mainly for specifying the security requirements, I guess that there may have a flag to identify the privacy requirement in WS-Policy such as "require" or "not require." 
Then if the "require" flag is set to true, Web services must retrieve their WS-Privacy document (like P3P Policy) for validation by using APPEL? 
OR something like that. 
Do we have a meeting call on April 30? 
BTW: without the " " I have a hard time distinguishing your comments from your context.. My inclination is that an application will specify which bindings its SOAP is supported with. 
*If* this is the case, then I would RECOMMEND that it define the SOAP statement as being inclusive of the SOAP interaction and the binding. 
Yep, though I expect HTTP will be very common. 
(In fact, it was recently reported that of Amazon's SOAP and REST (HTTP) interfaces, 85% of their usage is of the REST interface.)

Let's talk about an application and a Web service. 
An application is trying to call an operation (e.g., Webmethod in .Net 
Web Sevices) in a Web service. 
Thus, the Web service have toy the SOAP bindings for its oerations. 
I will be there.

Thus, the Web service have to specify the SOAP bindings for its operations. 
The application has to follow those SOAP bindings in order to call a particular operation in the Web service. 
Now, our question is *if* both application and Web service have their own privacy policies. 
Let's call them as WS-Policies. 
I still try to guess what is WS-Policy :-). 
What should be the scenario in this situation? 
When do they exchange/match their WS-Policies before an interaction is taken? 
Yes, I agree with you. 
I will be there.
