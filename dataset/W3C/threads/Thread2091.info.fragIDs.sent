<s> WHERE is this thought to occur?  </s>
<s> If a Digest is being digested then it is the digest value that is digested.  </s>
<s> Not the digest converted to base 16, 64 or any other form.  </s>
<s> This is essential since otherwise it introduces unnecessary transformations when gating HTTP-NG.  </s>
<s> The Digest is the 128 bits of information.  </s>
<s> The hexadecimal is nothing other than a means of transporting the digest.  </s>
<s> If this is unclear in the spec it should be made so.  </s>
<s> Specifying use of upper or lowercase should be irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Phill.  </s>
<s> HTTP already uses MIME-64 encoding for converting octects to characters; I'd suggest that re-using the same encoding scheme would make sense (since servers are likely to include the code already, and it's also more compact that 4bits- 1octect encoding).  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> (and not just because its only a single line change in my code :-) MD5s are recognisable as base64 objects.  </s>
<s> Base16 is still appropriate for the likes of timestamps and such though since they are genuinely numbers rather than blocks of random bits.  </s>

<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> I think the choice of base64 vs. base16 is purely arbitrary, since the space savings is hardly significant.  </s>

<s> My understanding is that Netscape has implemented Digest using base16 for a future release of their server.  </s>

<s> Phillip is right that MD5 is 128 bits, and nothing need be said about encodings, except for transport.  </s>
<s> Ah well thats OK then.  </s>
<s> so long as everyone realises I'm right we can put whatever people like in the spec so long as it is clear.  </s>
<s> In my original equations I think I simply assumed that the base-16 encoding was orthogonal to the hash function, the last thing to be done.  </s>
<s> That said we should rewrite the spec using the functions D for digest and H for hex (uppercase).  </s>
<s> And make it explicit that we use H(D( x )) each time H appears presently.  </s>
<s> My implementation will then be slightly non standard in using the uppercase for generation etc but accepting a digest passed using lowercase hex characters :-)  </s>
<s> 2) If 16 binary bytes should be used for each of H(A1) and H(A2) in digest , or for H(A1) in message-digest , why bother with the ':'s?  </s>
<s> I have never understood that one.  </s>
<s> My original scheme didn't use them.  </s>
<s> Same with the usernames.  </s>
<s> I could never understand the argument on : vs @ since the only reason its there is to stop the fields running together in a possibly ambiguous fashion.  </s>
