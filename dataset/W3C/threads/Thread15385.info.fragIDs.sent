<s> In our techniques call today we reached a resolution for layout table summaries: Layout tables must not have a summary (not even a NULL summary).  </s>
<s> This reverses our earlier decision that layout tables may have a summary.  </s>
<s> The rationale behind the no summary rule is: - layout tables should not be used (use CSS)  </s>
<s> - it appears that layout tables will be deprecated in XHTML2  </s>
<s> - the function of the layout table summary can be better expressed elsewhere  </s>
<s> - we should not require a NULL summary just to make the author "jump through hoops" Data tables must have a valid summary.  </s>
<s> Proposed description of a valid summary: The summary must describe the relationship between cells.  </s>
<s> The summary does not have a maximum length.  </s>
<s> The summary must not contain placeholder text.  </s>
<s> If the summary is less than 20 characters then it is suspicious.  </s>
<s> Discussion: Can the summary just link to another document (kinda like a longdesc)?  </s>
<s> What if the table is summarized in the document - do you still require a summary attribute?  </s>

<s> I disagree with this proposal.  </s>
<s> A null summary is more indicative of an author having decided that a table is a layout table.  </s>
<s> It is the only way people have agreed on to date that we can point out layout tables in code.  </s>
<s> I'm doubtful here.  </s>
<s> Given that there is no means of semantically marking up a table as a layout table (which is why we're in this mess in the first place), deprecating its use as such is, shall we say, quixotic, since all they can specify is an element's presence, not its abstract use case.  </s>
<s> That's the compromise we were, until now, willing to make.  </s>
<s> In testing pages for accessibility, I would not consider either summary="" or no summary to be a fail.  </s>
<s> Rather, I would consider summary="" to be a pass, and no summary to be a case for triggering user checking (in EARL 1.0, a "cannotTell").  </s>
<s> Given that less user checking equals better for most authors, I would indicate the former as a success case in the techniques document (and thus indicate the same to the E&amp;R tool vendors), but I would accept the latter, with author verification.  </s>

<s> I would suggest that the presence of the TH element is a better indicator of an author's decision about whether a table is a layout table or not.  </s>
<s> Assuming that we require that (a) all data tables have TH elements and (b)  </s>
<s> layout tables do not have TH elements, I think that also requiring summary on layout tables is an unnecessary requirement.  </s>
<s> The existence of TH (or lack thereof) could just as easily be used for triggering user checks and prompting the author to classify the table type.  </s>
<s> Defining table type based on the TH element also allows us to put forth a clear and simple rule about the use of the summary attribute on layout tables rather than suggest that they may or may not be used in certain ways (null vs. absent) or on certain types of layout tables.  </s>
<s> Also, if both the use of layout tables and the use of CSS are legitimate strategies for adjusting layout, then it seems to me that these strategies should have comparable mechanisms/requirements for including summary information.  </s>
<s> Since the CSS approach (which is at least in theory preferable to using tables for layout) does not include a mechanism for summarizing layout, I see no reason to require the presence of the summary attribute on layout tables.  </s>
<s> -Ben  </s>
<s> That's right.  </s>
<s> I forgot about that decision.  </s>
<s> I still believe that evaluation tools should not consider a null summary as a fail, and I think that should be lined out somewhere.  </s>
<s> It is still a technique that's in use, so dropping it outright would harm backward compatibility.  </s>
