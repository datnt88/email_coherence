Hi, I am just wondering whether Amaya already supports UTF-8 character encoding or whether it is planned to support it in the near future. 
I checked the documentation and the mailing list archive, and UTF-8 doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere. 
Thanks for the info.

THis work is in progress and we hope to have the UTF-8 support by the end of this year.

Hi, We undertake to support _Unicode_ not UTF-8. 
Actually, UTF-8 is used to store data in files. 
To process any kind of data (UTF-8, ISO-Latin*, ...) we need another internal encoding and procedures to convert, for instance, from UTF-8 to our internal representation of characters and vice-versa. 
I can't bet you that everything will be ready by the end of this year because we plan to support Unicode in the perspective of the software globalization. 
This needs more than the character encoding. 
In my opnion, even if everything is ready, we cannot release Amaya without a serious testing especially if 95% of the source code changes, nevertheless, we will try to do as soon as possible and as well as we can.
