<s> This new draft is an updated version of the DOM Level 3 Validation draft and takes into account the issues raised during the last call period.  </s>
<s> The current intention of the Working Group is to ask the Director to  </s>
<s> move the document to Candidate Recommendation soon.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> Are there any experimental implementations of DOM 3 Validation?  </s>
<s> Are there any there any conformance tests in the pipeline?  </s>
<s> Comments: continuousValidityChecking:  </s>
<s> In the description of continuousValidityChecking, "the implementation if free" should read "the implementation is free".  </s>
<s> In addition several parts of that description are awkward.  </s>
<s> "continuous checking ... is enforced" might be better as "the validity of the  </s>
<s> document is continuously enforced".  </s>
<s> "If the document is invalid" seems  </s>
<s> to have gotten separated from the sentence on setting the attribute.  </s>
<s> getDefinedElementTypes: In the description of DocumentVAL.getDefinedElementTypes, "element's namespace" appears repeatedly, but no clear definition of what element might be involved.  </s>
<s> There is an explicit namespaceURI parameter and there might be a document element that has a namespace, but not quite sure what element's namespace would be.  </s>
<s> validateDocument: How would warnings be issued?  </s>
<s> There appears to be an interface name missing between "[DOM Level 3 Core]" and "interface"  </s>
<s> isNodeValid:  </s>
<s> Determines if the Node is valid relative to the grammar.  </s>
<s> It doesn't normalize before checking if the document is valid.  </s>
<s> "document" in the second sentence looks like a typo.  </s>
<s> allowedChildren:  </s>
<s> Note that if no context of this element exists, then this is NULL; it  </s>
<s> is an empty list if the element is not in the document tree.  </s>
<s> Not clear on the distinction between "no context" and "not in the document tree".  </s>
<s> canSetAttributeNS: Uses a qualifiedName parameter when similar methods use localName.  </s>
<s> canSetAttributeNode: "with respect to the validity check level" is unique to this method.  </s>
<s> contentType: The values for EMPTY_CONTENTTYPE etc are not defined.  </s>
<s> An underscore between EMPTY_CONTENT_TYPE would be more readable.  </s>
<s> isElementDefined and isElementDefinedNS: Neither method depends on the target element.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't these be better on NodeVAL?  </s>
<s> allowedNextSiblings, allowedPreviousSiblings: There aren't parallel methods that would determine if a character node could be a previous or next sibling unless there is a special element name for character nodes.  </s>
<s> canDeleteData, canReplaceData, canInsertData: Would assume that this could throw the same exceptions as deleteData, replaceData and insertData if the offset or count parameters are out of range.  </s>
<s> NameList: I could not locate a definition for NameList.  </s>
<s> If it is defined in another DOM spec, it should have a reference.  </s>
<s> If not, then it is underdefined.  </s>
<s> How do you represent a namespace qualified name in a namelist?  </s>
<s> The 2 questions that you are asking are related to the Candidate Recommendation phase of the draft, not the current one.  </s>
<s> If the answers were yes, we would move directly to Proposed Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Briefly, 1) it's in progress 2) there are plans.  </s>
<s> As soon as we have tests, they'll be submitted to the TS repository.  </s>
<s> As for DOM Level 2 HTML, we will do an implementation report.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> Responses are below.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ben  </s>
<s> Yes, there will be two implementations written in Java.  </s>
<s> Tests in the W3C test framework will also be submitted.  </s>
<s> Changed.  </s>
<s> Changed to read: "AN ATTRIBUTE SPECIFYING WHETHER THE VALIDITY OF THE DOCUMENT IS CONTINUOUSLY ENFORCED.  </s>
<s> WHEN THE ATTRIBUTE IS SET TO TRUE, THE IMPLEMENTATION MAY RAISE CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION (SEE THE FOLLOWING).  </s>
<s> THIS ATTRIBUTE IS FALSE BY DEFAULT."  </s>
<s> A listing of the exceptions on setting follows the description.  </s>
<s> The description for getDefinedElements now reads: "RETURNS LIST OF ALL ELEMENT INFORMATION ITEM NAMES OF GLOBAL DECLARATION BELONGING TO THE SPECIFIED NAMESPACE".  </s>
<s> The method makes use of the passed-in error handler, as described in the DOM L3 CORE DOMConfiguration interface; warnings are handled through this exception handler.  </s>
<s> There is a link to this interface now.  </s>
<s> Determines if the Node is valid relative to the grammar.  </s>
<s> It doesn't normalize before checking if the document is valid.  </s>
<s> Corrected.  </s>
<s> Note that if no context of this element exists, then this is NULL; it  </s>
<s> They are the same; only "no context" is now referred to.  </s>
<s> This is modeled after setAttributeNS, so it will remain "qualifiedName".  </s>
<s> This phrase was deleted.  </s>
<s> A definition group ContentTypeVAL with all the defined constants was added.  </s>
<s> VAL_EMPTY_CONTENTTYPE is one of them; we decided not to add the extra underscore.  </s>
<s> No, an example of such a dependency would be the root element of a document.  </s>
<s> These could be done for character nodes via the canInsertBefore operation.  </s>
<s> Yes, they throw the same DOMException; this is listed now.  </s>
<s> Yes, a link to DOM L3 has been added.  </s>

<s> A return value from the validation would be useful when the only interest was if the document was schema or DTD valid.  </s>
<s> Without an explicit return value, it might be inferred that validation could be asynchronous.  </s>

<s> I guess they could depend on the target element for locally scoped element names.  </s>
<s> However, I don't see an obvious reason these could not be implemented on Node.  </s>
<s> Calling Document.isElementDefinedNS(ns, "foo") would be slightly different that doc.documentElement.isElementDefinedNS(ns,  </s>
<s> "foo") as the later would include elements defined in the scope of the document element.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, maybe a methods on the NameList's returned from allowableChildren et al would be better.  </s>
<s> Would it be useful to determine if an element was defined in the grammar but not a potential child of the element?  </s>
<s> Would isElementDefined[NS] return true if the name was defined as a locally scoped child element of some potential descendant of the current element?  </s>
<s> I'm uneasy about this one.  </s>

<s> As previously mentioned, there is not yet a public definition of NameList and it is not possible to fully review or implement this spec without a provisional definition.  </s>
<s> "Passed-in error handler" suggests that an instance of DOMErrorHandler  </s>
<s> is a parameter on the call to validateDocument.  </s>
<s> If it were then there would be no need to reference the definition of DOMConfiguration.  </s>
<s> If the intention to cast the document to DOMConfiguration and call the  </s>
<s> setParameter("error-handler", errorHandler), then you would need to define what would occur if setParameter("schema-location",...) was called after loading but before calling validateDocument.  </s>
<s> Changing the schema locations after document construction could be so disruptive that you may want to prevent it and use importNode when you want to recreate a document with a different schema.  </s>
<s> If DOMConfiguration was then only used as part of document loading, it might be moved from Core to Load/Save.  </s>
<s> My current preference is to define validateDocument as: boolean validateDocument(DOMErrorHandler errorHandler)  </s>
<s> The "passed-in" adjective was deleted.  </s>
<s> A config attribute of type DOMConfiguration has been added to the DocumentEditVAL interface to allow the setting of the error handler.  </s>
<s> The validateDocument method returns a validation state constant.  </s>
