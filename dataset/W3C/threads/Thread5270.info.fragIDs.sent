I was trying to catch up on the status of the wordnet task force and noticed that that task force description on the group page Links to Aldo's first message on the subject. 
Are there any plans to update this in the light of subsequent discussion. 
Is there a task force web page? 
Brian 
I am also very much interested in participating in this task force, so any digest in order to bring me up to date would be appreciated and/or a link to all the discussions in which case I could try to make the digest myself. 
Regards, Benjamin 
I am working on a digest, to be delivered before next telecon (next week).
