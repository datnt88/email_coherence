When should you use the link element (in the head section) to describe document navigation? 
Is this only necessary when the document already contains a formal structure like previous/next chapters in a book?

In general I would say book-like structures are the most useful use of this. 
But in principle I would say it could be useful for all pages (except the homepage) to have a link rel="Start" pointing to the homepage. 
And in non book-like structures like newspaper articles split among a few URIs, "Next" and "Prev" could be useful. 
I don't know as I'd go so far as to _require_ it but I think it's a good suggestion.

Where there is a book-like structure - i.e. there is a clearly identified next page or previous page, where there is a glossary or table of contents, I would suggest that the page fails checkpoint 13.2 if it doesn't have link elements of the appropriate type, no? Cheers Chaals
