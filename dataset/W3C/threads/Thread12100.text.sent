It is probable that we can arrange a telephone connection, to call in via a US bridge. 
Are there people who are unable to make the face to face meeting, but would like us to have this facility? 
Please respond as soon as possible - the decision will be made early next week. 
cheers Charles McCN Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) At least one "people" would. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE And at least on "people" would like you te be present - even at the end of a phone line (though in person would be better, of course!) Are there people who are unable to make the face to face meeting, but would like us to have this facility?

cheers Charles McCN Since it will be Mountain time where I'll be, 9am - 5pm Amsterdam time is 1am - 9am, so I would participate the second half of the day.
