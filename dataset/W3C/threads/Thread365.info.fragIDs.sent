Hi Dav, Unfortunately I have a problem with your Tidy on the ultimate test for any program - being able to decode/interpret a Microsoft data file. 
I have been attempting to 'decode' a large microsoft doc file and fortunately have been able to duplicate the problem in a small test file. 
While I use xml and xsl as the basis for my work writing requirements specifications I do not have a strong insight into all aspects of these concepts. 
However, it seems to me that the o:p - which usually appears in o:p /o:p pairs - should be passed by Tidy. 
As always with Microsoft data files the percentage of 'junk' is large! 
I would consider the Microsoft files legitimate candidates for your program - they display correctly in IE5 - and the detection of errors by 
Tidy seems to be context sensitive. 
Pragmatically I think that Tidy should be able to detect and 'fix' these errors. 
If you have a fix I would be pleased to test it for you - that is, I could you it as soon as you produce it. 
Kind regards David Goudie 
You may want to try the newer version of Microsofts HTML export filter which can be downloaded from the following address: I will look into adding support for o:p /o:p but this may take me a while due to the pressure of other work. 
Thanks for sending me the test file.

I just tried your test file and discovered that when you save the file to "Web page" (not using the HTML export filter), all of the o:p elements are empty. 
I am therefore curious as to why you want these preserved. 
For instance, at the end of the file there is: p class=MsoNormal b span lang=EN-AU ![if !supportEmptyParas] &amp;nbsp; ![endif] o:p /o:p /span /b /p Which is essentially an empty paragraph and a pretty poor way to add vertical whitespace.
