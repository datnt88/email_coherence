<s> Hi Dav, Unfortunately I have a problem with your Tidy on the ultimate test for any program - being able to decode/interpret a Microsoft data file.  </s>
<s> I have been attempting to 'decode' a large microsoft doc file and fortunately have been able to duplicate the problem in a small test file.  </s>
<s> While I use xml and xsl as the basis for my work writing requirements specifications I do not have a strong insight into all aspects of these concepts.  </s>
<s> However, it seems to me that the o:p - which usually appears in o:p /o:p pairs - should be passed by Tidy.  </s>
<s> As always with Microsoft data files the percentage of 'junk' is large!  </s>
<s> I would consider the Microsoft files legitimate candidates for your program - they display correctly in IE5 - and the detection of errors by  </s>
<s> Tidy seems to be context sensitive.  </s>
<s> Pragmatically I think that Tidy should be able to detect and 'fix' these errors.  </s>
<s> If you have a fix I would be pleased to test it for you - that is, I could you it as soon as you produce it.  </s>
<s> Kind regards David Goudie  </s>
<s> You may want to try the newer version of Microsofts HTML export filter which can be downloaded from the following address: I will look into adding support for o:p /o:p but this may take me a while due to the pressure of other work.  </s>
<s> Thanks for sending me the test file.  </s>

<s> I just tried your test file and discovered that when you save the file to "Web page" (not using the HTML export filter), all of the o:p elements are empty.  </s>
<s> I am therefore curious as to why you want these preserved.  </s>
<s> For instance, at the end of the file there is: p class=MsoNormal b span lang=EN-AU ![if !supportEmptyParas] &amp;nbsp; ![endif] o:p /o:p /span /b /p Which is essentially an empty paragraph and a pretty poor way to add vertical whitespace.  </s>
