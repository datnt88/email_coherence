<s> Eric's revision of the text of the checkpoint undoubtedly clarifies it.  </s>
<s> However, as Gregg has argued, consistently and persuasively, until such time as multimedia players (that is to say, user agents) can synchronize a spoken rendering of the text equivalent with the audio track of a multimedia presentation, there is no other means available of providing a synchronized equivalent to the video.  </s>
<s> He therefore maintained that this item must have a priority 1 rating, as failure to include a description renders the content inaccessible.  </s>
<s> However, it could be maintained, to the contrary, that even if checkpoint 1.3 were not followed, there would still be a textual equivalent available (checkpoint 1.1) which, at present, could not be synchronized with the multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> The lack of synchronization might make such a description somewhat superfluous however; perhaps this would depend on the length and nature of the video.  </s>
<s> My own preference would be to opt for a conservative solution by adopting substance of Eric's wording in so far as it clarifies the checkpoint, and retaining the priority 1 classification.  </s>
<s> Gregg has also maintained, with equal persuasiveness, that auditory descriptions will be used by individuals who are vision impaired, not just those who are legally blind.  </s>
<s> I would therefore suggest broadening (or omitting) the reference to blindness contained in Eric's proposed revision.  </s>
<s> Eric's clarification of the "until" clause, and his effort to distinguish between auditory descriptions as audio streams supplied by the content developer, and as spoken renderings of text equivalents as generated by the user agent/multimedia player, are reasonable amendments.  </s>
<s> I still feel that the way in which the auditory description is produced belongs in techniques.  </s>
<s> At the moment, the effective method is to use a data file (typically in a dedicated audio format) and an audio player on the client side.  </s>
<s> In a few years the most effective method will be to use a data file with a different format (namely text, which happens to compress well, and be useful for a number of other tasks) with an audio player (a text to speech synthesiser, to be precise).  </s>
<s> My personal feeling is that the additions are unnecessary complication.  </s>
<s> But I don't think it's a show-stopper.  </s>
