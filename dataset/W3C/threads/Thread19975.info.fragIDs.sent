<s> Hello Hugh, Thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> Already I see that a bug is that the libwww that was put in the tar file wasn't checked out from CVS using the Amaya tag.  </s>
<s> Besides making the tar file a bit bigger, you're also missing three files which I have changed on the libwww/amaya tree, but not yet committed to the public libwww one, as I'm still testing them.  </s>
<s> I'll continue looking at the problem as I think that something else is missing and I'll mail the results to the list later on (or more likely, tomorrow morning :).  </s>
