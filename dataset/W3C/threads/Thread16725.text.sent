As we've interpreted it, June 21st, 2001 is the deadline to be in compliance with the new 508 standards. 
This being Feb 15th means that 56 days have already gone by. 
Or, 31% to save everyone from doing that calculation. 
It is disconcerting to see so many posts (mine included) that are still attempting to define some of the standards. 
It appears that there are many things that are still not clear as far as implementation goes. 
Confusion on the proper way to approach this or that. 
The Final Rule of the 508 was not nearly detailed enough to simply implement. 
Seems to me that they took a conceptual approach to accessibility and left the details to the development community to figure out. 
The development folks are forced to learn quite a bit about assistive technologies before even starting on 508 compliance. 
Some might argue that there were proposed rules prior to the final. 
True, but, proposed rules are not final rules and to develop to them could have meant having to redo some percentage of our effort based on differences between the two. 
Perhaps six months to bring the all of the federal government web sites into compliance is a bit optimistic. 
Six months to learn what we need to learn, the "can do's" and "cannot do's" would have worked with another six months alloted for the actual implementation. 
Jim Fitzgerald [ posted back to original lists ] Len has been kind enough to reprimand me privately for the tone of my posting. 
I hereby apologise unconditionally for the confrontational tone, and will avoid it in future in these lists. 
I do, however, stand by the substance of my posting, which seems to me an important issue. 
I should add that I raised it here precisely because it seemed to me less damaging to do so in a forum that is relatively small and broadly sympathetic than in the Newsgroups, where it might serve to support those individuals who are openly opposed to accessibility. 
Nick Kew Jim, Let me make a correction to your comment about the deadline. 
The actual deadline is 180 days from the date of the final standards. 
180 days is actually June 19, 2001. 
I also feel your pain about the time constraints. 
It would be nice to have some time to learn.
