<s> I have a question about all of the Document.create... methods in the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> My current (mis)understanding is that when an element is created using Document.createElement that it is not yet part of the document hierarchy.  </s>
<s> If I have an empty Document object (where hasChildNodes() returns false) and I use createElement() to create a new Element object, does hasChildNodes() still return false?  </s>
<s> If so, this would have an interesting implication: these newly created nodes can node be found by any of the methods used to traverse the document tree, like Node.getChildNodes() in the Java implementation.  </s>
<s> And  </s>
<s> a Document object that is used to create an Attribute object with Document.createAttribute() would not return that Attribute when  </s>
<s> Node.getAttributes() is called in the Java implementation.  </s>
<s> My understanding is this: An Element node can be created using a Document and that Document would be the Element's ownerDocument (but not parent).  </s>
<s> Once an Element object is placed in the Document tree using a method like Node.appendNode(), then and only then would it appear as a child object of any other object.  </s>

<s> Yes, Alan, you've read it correctly.  </s>
<s> True.  </s>
<s> It has an ownerDocument (the Document whose factory you used to produce it), but has no parent or siblings; you've created an "orphan" node.  </s>

<s> I presume you meant "can not be found" -- which is entirely correct.  </s>
<s> Also correct.  </s>
<s> It isn't an attribute of the Document -- in fact, Documents can't have Attributes -- and it isn't an attribute of any Element until you assign it to one.  </s>
