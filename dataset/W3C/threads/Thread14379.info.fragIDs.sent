From a meeting too long ago [15 June]: "Resolution: to provide author with information and let them decide to use "" or " " for decorational images." 
I think that means "decorative" but never one to avoid coining new words. 
In summary: Authors must decide: 1) if a particular image is purely decorational; 2) it's an image not worth writing any descriptive or replacement text for; 3) which of the permissible predicates to put in the 
attribute ALT=. 
Is it to be the emphatic null "", or the wishy-washy white space " "? 
The considerations are: 1) one or both may trigger the dreaded PROMPT "you've neglected to insert alt-text for the image foo.jpg - enter here or sacrifice your Single-A Logo (and any thought of achieving Double- or Triple-A!); 2) the viewer's screen reader may do anything from nothing through a pause all the way to saying "space"; 3) The viewer may place a curse on you for alt-text denial. 
The choice is the authors' and my only recommendation is that they heed the advice of their favorite assistive technology user. 
The important thing is that no semantics be lost. 
There is an essay at http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#structure in which it is pointed out that hr (horizontal rule) isn't a structural element EXCEPT FOR BLINDLESS READERS. 
Yet it could be if it had structural markup associated with it. 
Many of an author's eye-candy conceits are used structurally - without her even knowing she's doing that! 
Structure shouldn't be denied to people with disabilities or to machines. 
Structure should be device-independent. 
Having said all that, there are purely decorative that need not be dealt with as if they conveyed meaning or structure and for those elements alt="" or alt=" " are equally lame copouts. 
Love.

Considerations... 4) In Internet Explorer 4+, the alt-text is displayed as a tool-tip when a mouse-using user hovers over the image. 
alt=" " causes a tooltip with a single blank character in it, or to the uninitiated, a weird little yellow box. 
The tooltip feature ignores alt="".

Thanks for that one. 
I'm sure we'll rekindle some of the old points and if we can collect them into one "here's the pros &amp; cons, you decide" thing it will be useful as a note in the techniques. 
Love.

I've maintained the view that ALT text is meant to be a functional alternative for the image, not "descriptive". 
If something descriptive is required, you have the TITLE and LONGDESC attributes available. 
The unfortunate spot in the HTML4 specification where ALT is described as "short description" in my opinion is an editorial blunder, and is incompatible with the better-informed description at says: "alternate text to serve as content when the element cannot be rendered normally". 
"To serve as content" and "to describe the content" are two quite different concepts, which are in general incompatible with each other, which fits very well with the fact that HTML has different attributes for these purposes. 
The TITLE attribute is available for a short description of the content; the ALT attribute is meant to "serve as content" i.e to be a functional replacement for the image, not to be a description of it. 
Sometimes the correct functional replacement for an image seems indeed to be a null string, or some kind of separator. 
There have been detailed arguments (some at the level of HTML technicalities, some based on the actual behaviour of current browsers) as to whether the use of nothing more than "white space" in the ALT attribute is acceptable. 
Maybe non-white space should be used, but I don't want to stall the discussion on that kind of detail. 
I have to express my dislike of your phrase "not worth writing". 
There are times, in my view, when the correct functional replacement is indeed null, and writing it is the correct thing to do, rather than mere laziness as you seem to imply. 
I don't see any objection to having null or only-space ALT attribute with a meaningful descriptive TITLE, in appropriate situations. 
It closely fits the principles of the (better-informed) parts of the HTML4 specification, for example. 
The only practical objection for that is the lack of support for it in certain popular browser versions. 
But it would be a pity to ruin the documented solution based only on the inadequacy of some currently-available client software. 
best regards 
Duly noted. 
I thought you'd object more to "copout" but that's life, I guess g . 
Your preferred language from the html tech doc also says "Several non-textual elements (IMG, AREA, APPLET, and INPUT) let authors specify alternate text..." The word "let" in there raises my hackles a bit. 
In my "them's fightin' words, pardner" lexicon it's a questionable verb and should be "require". 
If we require alt attribute with every instance of img element (and I believe we do and should) then some decision regarding what constitutes acceptable content must ensue. 
Because there is clearly no chance of agreement, at least between " " or "", we decided in essence not to decide - to leave it up to the author. 
The problem that a tool has in deciding if one or the other indicates an action to licitly include alt, but no meaningful content is still with us. 
My aim in writing about where the issue stands is to inform authors about the various "alt alternatives" so they have awareness of: 1) the importance of alt; 2) reasons/excuses for making the choice to disinclude useful information therefrom. 
The admonition to "ask your favorite accessible technology user" for an opinion is serious and so, IMHO is "copout". 
I don't think there are entries made in a document that have zero semantic content, even if it's as trivial as "I had too much space over on this side and decided to put in a little rosette thingie." 
In fact the argument about hr not being "structure" is specious and based on retinal meanness. 
Blindless people clearly use these lines as structural benchmarks. 
I could (and probably will) go on... Love.
