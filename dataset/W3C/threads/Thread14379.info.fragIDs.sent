<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I've maintained the view that ALT text is meant to be a functional alternative for the image, not "descriptive".  </s>
<s> If something descriptive is required, you have the TITLE and LONGDESC attributes available.  </s>
<s> The unfortunate spot in the HTML4 specification where ALT is described as "short description" in my opinion is an editorial blunder, and is incompatible with the better-informed description at says: "alternate text to serve as content when the element cannot be rendered normally".  </s>
<s> "To serve as content" and "to describe the content" are two quite different concepts, which are in general incompatible with each other, which fits very well with the fact that HTML has different attributes for these purposes.  </s>
<s> The TITLE attribute is available for a short description of the content; the ALT attribute is meant to "serve as content" i.e to be a functional replacement for the image, not to be a description of it.  </s>
<s> Sometimes the correct functional replacement for an image seems indeed to be a null string, or some kind of separator.  </s>
<s> There have been detailed arguments (some at the level of HTML technicalities, some based on the actual behaviour of current browsers) as to whether the use of nothing more than "white space" in the ALT attribute is acceptable.  </s>
<s> Maybe non-white space should be used, but I don't want to stall the discussion on that kind of detail.  </s>
<s> I have to express my dislike of your phrase "not worth writing".  </s>
<s> There are times, in my view, when the correct functional replacement is indeed null, and writing it is the correct thing to do, rather than mere laziness as you seem to imply.  </s>
<s> I don't see any objection to having null or only-space ALT attribute with a meaningful descriptive TITLE, in appropriate situations.  </s>
<s> It closely fits the principles of the (better-informed) parts of the HTML4 specification, for example.  </s>
<s> The only practical objection for that is the lack of support for it in certain popular browser versions.  </s>
<s> But it would be a pity to ruin the documented solution based only on the inadequacy of some currently-available client software.  </s>
<s> best regards  </s>
<s> Duly noted.  </s>
<s> I thought you'd object more to "copout" but that's life, I guess g .  </s>
<s> Your preferred language from the html tech doc also says "Several non-textual elements (IMG, AREA, APPLET, and INPUT) let authors specify alternate text..." The word "let" in there raises my hackles a bit.  </s>
<s> In my "them's fightin' words, pardner" lexicon it's a questionable verb and should be "require".  </s>
<s> If we require alt attribute with every instance of img element (and I believe we do and should) then some decision regarding what constitutes acceptable content must ensue.  </s>
<s> Because there is clearly no chance of agreement, at least between " " or "", we decided in essence not to decide - to leave it up to the author.  </s>
<s> The problem that a tool has in deciding if one or the other indicates an action to licitly include alt, but no meaningful content is still with us.  </s>
<s> My aim in writing about where the issue stands is to inform authors about the various "alt alternatives" so they have awareness of: 1) the importance of alt; 2) reasons/excuses for making the choice to disinclude useful information therefrom.  </s>
<s> The admonition to "ask your favorite accessible technology user" for an opinion is serious and so, IMHO is "copout".  </s>
<s> I don't think there are entries made in a document that have zero semantic content, even if it's as trivial as "I had too much space over on this side and decided to put in a little rosette thingie."  </s>
<s> In fact the argument about hr not being "structure" is specious and based on retinal meanness.  </s>
<s> Blindless people clearly use these lines as structural benchmarks.  </s>
<s> I could (and probably will) go on... Love.  </s>
