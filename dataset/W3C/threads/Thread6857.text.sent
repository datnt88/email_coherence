Hello, For consideration as an agenda item at the spec-prod BOF (will there be one?) I would like to propose we look at the possibility of a CSS user style sheet that reverses TR colors to light on a dark background. 
A www-style thread [1] about TR readability started today. 
Also, a tangent for spec-prod, a message from Cem Karan on www-talk [2] asked for consistent W3C syntax conventions and terminology definitions, pointing to XML as a model.

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - http://www.w3.org/ / Susan Lesch lesch@w3.org was heard to say: Are we having a BOF? 
When? 
My schedule's getting pretty full... Be seeing you, norm Norman.Walsh@East.Sun.COM | Yeah, we could do that, but it would Technology Development Group | open Pandora's can of worms.--Terry 
Allen Sun Microsystems, Inc. | Since I hadn't thought I would be around at all, I haven't been paying too much attention to talk of a BOF. 
But I *could* make it into Cambridge one evening, and if a time hasn't been settled, perhaps we could meet over drinks or dinner. 
What about 6pm Tuesday 27 Feb or Wednesday 28 Feb? (I fear everyone's booked up for dinner already...) Eve Eve Maler +1 781 442 3190 Sun Microsystems XML Technology Center eve.maler @ east.sun.com

What about 6pm Tuesday 27 Feb or Wednesday 28 Feb? (I fear everyone's booked up for dinner already...) I vote for Tuesday. 
Be seeing you, norm Norman.Walsh@East.Sun.COM | The offhand decision of some commonplace Technology Development Group | mind high in office at a critical moment Sun Microsystems, Inc. | influences the course of events for a hundred years.--Thomas
