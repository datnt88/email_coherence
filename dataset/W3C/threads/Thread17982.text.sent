JT: I heartily agree with Jon's assertion about use terms. 
JG: The current labels ("inter-operable and non-interoperable) in Ian's proposal do not mean anything to anybody outside our working group and therefore people are worried that they will be miss used (I agree with that concern). 
JT: I just asked to members of the team here if they knew what those terms meant and, no! 
I like the idea of saying what we mean as in Jon's suggestion: JG: Category 1: Desktop Graphical User Agent Category 2: Non-Graphical Assistive Technology User Agent Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns

thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 Jon Gunderson jongund@staff.uiuc.edu on 09/29/99 11:25:08 AM Subject: Proposal for conformance categories I think that the labels we use for the conformance categories need to be clear and much our problem I thnk center on not having clear labels with the conformance issue. 
The current categoies used in our document are not also not entirely clear (Desktop Graphical User Agent and Dependent User Agent). 
The conformance categories should be clear to our intended audiences. 
I propose that we use terminology similar to: Category 1: Desktop Graphical User Agent Category 2: Non-Graphical Assistive Technology User Agent I think these categories are clear in their meaning and who is intended to conform to them. 
I think the main difference between the two is the issue of using accessibility APIs and exporting internal document representations to assistive technologies. 
DGUA need to do this. 
The other issue on the bubble between the two is device indepdendence. 
It is clear that we want it for DGUA. 
These are the two categories of user agents we know about right now and want to provide solutions. 
In general the checkpints should ask people to do whta ever they do in an accessible way. 
If I do graphics, keyboard and mouse: I should do it in an accessible way. 
If I do speech and keyboard, I do it in an acessible way. 
I think claiming conformance is an issue WAI as a whole needs to deal with and I will bring it up to Judy Brewer as a issue for the coordination group.

After sending my last note, I realized that Jon's category 2: "Non-Graphical Assistive Technology User Agent," Should just be: "Assistive Technology User Agent" An AT UA may be graphical, whatever graphical is.

thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 MN: I really wish there was some way, or some term, that would pull in more than "just" Assistive Technology User Agent(s) as part of Category 2. Obviously, other software developers can do as they wish, but I can't tell you how many times we've come across a great piece of software, commercial and/or shareware, that if it did this "one other little thing", that the developer probably would have done had they "understood the need", it would be the solution for an individual's access problem. 
It just seems to me, that our "Categry 2" label, is just one more chance for us to educate, and get more developer's to "understand the needs", but if we title it "Assistive Technology User Agent", we only send the message to those already in the church. 
The dificulty is that if I do speech, keyboard, mouse, and graphics, is it OK to do speech and keyboard in an accessible way, but not graphics and mouse, and furthermore not to provide any way for an assistive technology to be used to improve the accessibility of the graphics and mouse bit that I do. 
It seems to me that without device independence (and we allow a fair amount of this to be achieved through APIs rather than natively in the current draft) and exporting information to assitive technologies there is the possibility for produing a good tool for a particular market group. 
Consider for a moment the EIAD browser, which is designed for people with brain injuries or cognitive disabilities (as I understand it). 
This relies on a touch screen interface. 
However a number of people with acquired brain injuries also suffer sever mobility impairments, and may need an assistive technology to use the interface (perhaps a foot-driven mouse, or a head switch), and therefore the tool. 
If this is not possible then is the tool accessible, or just a useful tool for a particular market niche? 
In the same way, a tool which is designed for the group of web users who are interested in a largely graphic, primarily point and click interface with the use of the keyboard for some advance functions may or may not export interfaces. 
While Internet explorer matches that definition, it is a rough attempt at summarising the needs of a large number of deaf users, as well as perhaps a small majority of web users in general. 
I think there is a big problem with saying that a brwser which meets the needs of 80% of the people, incluing a significant disability community, does not conform, while one which meets the needs of 8% of the people including a significant disability community does, unless we define conformance in terms of specific sets of needs - blindness, low vision, hard of hearing, mobility impairment plus blindness, hard of hearing, low vision and cognitive impairment, ... The difficulty with that approach is the sheer number of individual needs sets that must be catered for. 
The impact matrix is a tool that could be used to make those various subsets clear, but defining overall conformance on the basis of conformance to a subset means that there is no reason why a "desktop graphical user agent" can't simply count up the number of subsets it matches and say "we conform to more subsets than anyone else, and therefore we have done more than is required..." Charles McCN I think that the labels we use for the conformance categories need to be clear and much our problem I thnk center on not having clear labels with the conformance issue. 
The current labels ("inter-operable and non-interoperable) in Ian's proposal do not mean anything to anybody outside our working group and therefore people are worried that they will be miss used (I agree with that concenr).
