I find the person on this list with the signature that says accessibility is a right is being totally commercially naive. 
That's me, Bro. 
Naive. 
However, the bill hasn't been presented yet for the current transgressions. 
The legal advice that Dow and Philip Morris had in the 30s came back to haunt them when the payouts almost bankrupted the former and are a huge nudge on the latter. 
IBM will experience similar problems if they continue failing to heed that "naive" signature when such things as the Bruce Maguire matter evolve further. 
Programmers are cheaper than lawyers and the SOCOG spent more on legal "expertise" in cross-examining Jutta than would have been spent making the Olympics site accessible. 
The "business case" is not a simplistic "last 20%" of the potential clients' issue. 
The probability of an "accessibility impact study" similar to the "environmental impact study" that was almost surely the result of a book by Rachel Carson about 60 years ago is very real and to pretend that there is some "market force" that isn't made entirely possible only because of "rule of law" issues is what's really "naive". 
I have been watching the world for a very long time and I'm more amused than offended by the notion that I'm "totally commerciallly naive" simply because my objectivity is still with me. 
The objections to providing accessibility are based almost entirely on bigotry and fear of disabilities (which are inevitable for all of us), not on pragmatics. 
Most of the mainstream culture wants to retain blind folks as pity objects and it shows.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
In my experience creating web sites for companies and organizations, I have found that most people are ignorant (by no fault of thier own) to the needs of many useres of the web. 
People picture it as a visual medium. 
I do believe however that the future will be brighter because of several factors. 
One is that creating accessible content is something that can be sold as a product, and that web design firms (like my employer) will begin to push. 
This isn't a purely selfless act, as it will add another product to the package, and more money to the price tag. 
It can also be an easy sell to clients, because who doesn't have a friend or loved one with some sort of disability. 
The other factor is that most large scale sites are template driven, especially those made by my company. 
The beauty there is that you can make several versions of the site by changing just one template page. 
So with one set of content, you can have versions of the site for slow modems, screen readers, large print, or printer-friendly pages.

I don't mean this sarcastically but "Duh!" This has been what Universal Design advocates have been trying to get across for a very long time. 
The idea that "retrofitting's a bitch" and its corollary "programmers are cheaper than lawyers" are beginning to take hold and I hope your firm has the good sense to in fact charge extra if accessibility concerns are not addressed as a defense against future complicity negligence lawsuits. 
There is a legal theory that if you know you're likely to be advising (or agreeing to) breaking the law, you are liable for whatever occurs. 
Since most everybody in this trade can be shown to either know about these issues or should know, this could become a big factor. 
At next week's "Device Independent Authoring Workshop" in Bristol we will be studying these issues in (I hope) great depth. 
We don't need a bunch of "separate but equal" Webs or Web pages. 
I hope we can reach agreement on the basic principles to achieve device independence - starting with the idea that a human user is a "device" in the sense we are speaking of. 
Love.
