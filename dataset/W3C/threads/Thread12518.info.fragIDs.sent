Hi all, For logistical reasons it appears that the best time and place to meet is in Austin at IBM in February. 
We need to avoid the first week of February and the weekend of the 15th. 
The proposed dates are: February 19th and 20th, or February 26th and 27th. 
How do these dates suit you? 
Will you be able to attend? 
Thanks Jutta 
Grande!! Have you notified the w3c-translator's list?
