<s> Changes I still want to see in the new document (assuming the other accepted things are folded in, such as title change etc.) I didn't get closure with Graham on changes to the following two things (Jeremy - what are your comments?) 2.2.4 XML-based syntax RDF has an XML-based serialization form which, if used appropriately, allows a wide range of "ordinary" XML data to be interpreted as RDF [STRIPEDRDF].  </s>
<s> -- http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/Current/Overview.htm#xtocid48012  </s>
<s> Revision 1.27 2002/07/29 13:21:36 graham Still bogus - 'appropriately', 'ordinary' and citing the wrong thing.  </s>
<s> If you want to have give some personal design advice or experience on creating RDF/XML syntax profiles, put that a document of your own, not a 'concepts and abstract data model' WG document.  </s>
<s> The striped syntax document does not describe the XML syntax in a normative way.  </s>
<s> Remove this.  </s>
<s> I suggest: RDF has a recommended XML serialization form which can be used to encode the data model[RDF-SYNTAX].  </s>
<s> which doesn't include the IMHO too value-laden words you had.  </s>
<s> 2.4.3 XML serialization syntax RDF has a specific serialization syntax based on XML.  </s>
<s> There are several ways in which a given RDF graph can be represented in XML: these various forms allow RDF to be represented in ways that are amenable to specific XML applications.  </s>
<s> In this way, XML application data can easily be designed to be accessible to generic RDF processors [XML-AS-RDF].  </s>

<s> Revision 1.27 2002/07/29 13:21:36 graham Here we go again with promoting profiles of the XML syntax and citing a draft ID document you wrote instead of the recommended syntax and WD which isn't cited until 5 paragraphs later in 2.5 I want to see just syntax wd cited here since, again, that's what this section is about.  </s>
<s> Your personal work may be interesting, but promoting the latter above the recommended syntax isn't useful to people looking for definitive pointers.  </s>
<s> If such design advice is needed, put some more complete paragraphs together to the group and we can see where it may live - in the primer (as design advice, or an RDF in the field section) or the syntax WD. Dave  </s>
<s> Dave, Short response: (a) you are picking up on points I've already agreed to change but which aren't reflected in the document.  </s>
<s> (The document revision you cite is not intended to be a candidate for review since it can change at any time, and as such is not a version that has been lodged in www-archive.  </s>
<s> Apart from a slip in the initial announcement, I've tried to cite only stable document revisions.)  </s>
<s> (b) There is an issue in contention concerning which I've already asked for wider WG input.  </s>
<s> Details below...  </s>
<s> I've already accepted the principle of changing this text, which isn't currently reflected in the document revision you cite, and asked for wider WG input on the matter of mentioning the striped syntax.  </s>
<s> -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0196.html  </s>
<s> My case is this: I think the striped syntax and RDF-as-XML are worth mentioning, because in my perception and experience they represent a strong rationale for the XML serialization syntax being the way it is.  </s>
<s> This is based on my RDF learning experience with CC/PP: simply stating the various allowed forms of RDF syntax left me confused, but recognizing the way they reflect some common XML usage it was much easier to understand.  </s>
<s> If others don't agree with my perception then I'll pull the material, but currently this is running at the level of a personal disagreement which I don't think is grounds to make the change.  </s>
<s> Again, I've already agreed to add the syntax citation here and look for an alternative more widely recognized example to cite, which isn't currently reflected in the document version you are referencing.  </s>
<s> Here's the alternative reference I propose: RDF Site Summary (RSS) 1.0 (In many ways, I think that's a superior example, because it illustrates the evolution of an XML-based format to the wider, more expressive world of RDF metadata - illustrates very simply that adopting RDF need not be a painful exercise.)  </s>
<s> This appears in a sub-section headed "Concepts", and I think this is a useful concept to mention.  </s>
<s> Again, if the group thinks it's inappropriate, I'll pull the material.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> I've not yet done my review, though I did read through an earlier doc.  </s>
<s> Can you remind me which version is the review target?  </s>
<s> (and archive a new snapshot at www-archive if appropriate).  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> The current review target, released Monday and also lodged in www-archive, is: (See: for the www-archive URI.) (There is an accessible editors' working copy, which Dave cited in his recent message.) #g Graham Klyne  </s>
