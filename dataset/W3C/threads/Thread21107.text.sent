does Amayz support MathML 2.0? 
I'm having trouble using things like apply and  matrix !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" 
It says that things like matrixrow are unsupported. 
and also it says sin and ci "Invalid or unsupported MathML element cn " On Tue, 17 Jun 2003 12:27:31 -0400 (EDT) Yes Amaya supports MathML 2.0. 
But only the presentation part of MathML. 
Regards Irene. 
Ir?ne Vatton INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes INRIA ZIRST e-mail: Irene.Vatton@inria.fr 655 avenue de l'Europe Yes, but only the presentation part of MathML, not the content part. 
The issue is that your document is using content MathML. 
Please refer to the "Known Issues" section of the obline documentation (Help/Math) Vincent.
