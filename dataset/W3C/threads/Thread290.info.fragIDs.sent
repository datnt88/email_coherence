<s> First, congrats on a great piece of software.  </s>
<s> I use it through HTML-Kit and am extremely impressed with Tidy's power and ease of use (one click on their interface).  </s>
<s> Here are a couple suggestions:  </s>
<s> + It would be nice for Tidy to verify that the charset being used is the correct canonical name (e.g., ISO-8859-1 not ISO_8859-1) both in the XML processing instruction ?xml  </s>
<s> version="1.0"  </s>
<s> encoding="UTF-8"?  </s>
<s> and META tags such as: meta http-equiv="Content-Type"  </s>
<s> + I assume you are aware that Tidy reports an error when shown the new XHTML namespace of http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml and incorrectly changes it to http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1 .  </s>
<s> And, Tidy incorrectly reports a bug for xml:lang="en".  </s>
<s> + Finally, I think you should consider having an option for Tidy to add a Dave Raggett at the W3C, version 30th November 1999" href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/" .  </s>
<s> The point would be for anyone viewing the HTML source to say, "Wow, I wish my source looked this nice!" and immediately know what to do about it.  </s>
<s> Of course, you would want to allow people to turn this off, but I would suggest that the default should be on.  </s>
<s> Thanks again for the great utility.  </s>

<s> Sounds straightforward.  </s>
<s> I will put this in the queue for work on enhancements.  </s>
<s> This will be fixed in the December release.  </s>
<s> I would be interested in what other folk think of this idea.  </s>
<s> It would need to be modified slightly, since href is not an allowed attribute for meta.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for your input.  </s>

<s> I approve!  </s>
<s> I think you should allow us the option to give you some credit for your hard work.  </s>
<s> I *regularly* use HTML Tidy to clean up ugly markup and it is one of my favorite tools (in its HTML-Kit incarnation, particularly).  </s>
<s> A META tag wouldn't hurt anything and making it an option should remove any possible objection.  </s>
<s> John Tobler  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> HTML Tidy is my program of choice when working with HTML, both to keep my own code in order and make the appallingly markup produced by some other programs readable.  </s>
<s> A META tag would serve as a recognition of the work done on HTML Tidy and  </s>
<s> as a pointer to the program for people looking at the HTML source for a page.  </s>
<s> TTFN, Philip Riebold  </s>
<s> Basically I am in favour of the suggestion.  </s>
<s> I would not necessarily consider tidy a "generator" of the HTML, but I can't think of a better expression right now.  </s>
<s> Since href is not an allowed attribute within meta one could opt for the solution content="...,http://..." this is similar to the http-equiv="refresh" syntax in meta .  </s>

<s> Hi Dave,  </s>
<s> The HTML spec allows for machine-readable META data lines in the header, one variant of which specifies the last update date and time of the file: I believe this and the other META statements are valuable indicators on HTML files.  </s>
<s> The FTP program I use stamps the current date and time on the file's hard-disc catalogue information when they are transferred, rather than that from the source disc.  </s>
<s> Having the actual update time encoded in the file itself allows it to be quickly checked to see if it is the current version.  </s>
<s> I was wondering if it would be possible for Tidy to recognise this Meta statement and update it, or even (optionally?) to add one in the same way as it adds a Generator statement?  </s>
