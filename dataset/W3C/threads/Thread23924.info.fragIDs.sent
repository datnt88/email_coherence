<s> This is an inappropriate forum for font piracy.  </s>
<s> How stunningly appropriate.  </s>

<s> I am glad that no-one resonded by sending you the fonts.  </s>

<s> Well, purchasing is easy, just go to the Adobe website.  </s>
<s> Since the original posted said already that they were Adobe fonts well, clearly they know whwre to get them.  </s>

<s> I have never heard of that.  </s>
<s> This is probably a good thing.  </s>
<s> If so you owe me an apology for insulting me in a public forum.  </s>
<s> Sure, if you clarify that you are not looking fro stolen fonts in a public forum.  </s>
<s> The question then arises, why were you sending such messages toa forum which deals with the creation of specifications and standards for font technologies on the Web?  </s>
<s> What, in fact, did it have to do with that topic at all?  </s>

<s> I, Franchesca Havas, clarify that I was not looking for stolen fonts in a public forum.  </s>
<s> I am guilty of looking for the most competitive offering of the font from fellow developers on a consistant basis over the years.  </s>
<s> Of the 5 emails I recieved from this request the one from the UK was the most competitve in price and offerning of developemental tools with the font.  </s>
<s> We were not looking for the bundle package of many unusable fonts that Adobe offered at the time to be purchased online.  </s>
<s> There are other less expensive bundles that others are authorized to sell with developement tools.  </s>
<s> The world is not black and white Chris.  </s>
<s> There are shades of many colors.  </s>
<s> I will now contact individuals for those needs and post to this list when it is more appropiate to the forum.  </s>
