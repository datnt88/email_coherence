Last I liiked, this was www-font not wareZ.FoNt 
This is an inappropriate forum for font piracy. 
How stunningly appropriate. 
You may like to consult the license on these 
two fonts, assuming you have one. 
That way, you would get bot education and 
experience. 
Ches@io.com, this is the last posting to www-font that you will see; you 
are unsubscribed as of now, and also added to the blocking filter list.

Excuse me? 
Did I ask for someone to give it to me for free? 
NO. Read the email. 
It was a plea for help. 
And help this list provided. 
Every response was private and pointed to where it could be purchased. 
I am glad that no-one resonded by sending you the fonts. 
It was purchased. 
Well, purchasing is easy, just go to the Adobe website. 
Since the original posted said already that they were Adobe fonts well, clearly they know whwre to get them. 
Fonts On Call, or buy with a credit card. 
But "searching 
on the internet" sure sounds like font piracy to me. 
And what the heck is warez.Font? 
I have never heard of that. 
This is probably a good thing. 
If so you owe me an apology for insulting me in a public forum. 
Sure, if you clarify that you are not looking fro stolen fonts in a public forum. 
The question then arises, why were you sending such messages toa forum which deals with the creation of specifications and standards for font technologies on the Web? 
What, in fact, did it have to do with that topic at all?

I, Franchesca Havas, clarify that I was not looking for stolen fonts in a public forum. 
I am guilty of looking for the most competitive offering of the font from fellow developers on a consistant basis over the years. 
Of the 5 emails I recieved from this request the one from the UK was the most competitve in price and offerning of developemental tools with the font. 
We were not looking for the bundle package of many unusable fonts that Adobe offered at the time to be purchased online. 
There are other less expensive bundles that others are authorized to sell with developement tools. 
The world is not black and white Chris. 
There are shades of many colors. 
I will now contact individuals for those needs and post to this list when it is more appropiate to the forum.
