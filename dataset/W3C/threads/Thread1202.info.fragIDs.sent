<s> The Unicode Consortium Technical Committee (UTC) has asked me to look into what would be involved in deprecating the character set titled  </s>
<s> "unicode-1-1".  </s>
<s> This character set was registered in conjunction with RFC 1641, "Using Unicode with MIME".  </s>
<s> This 16-bit character set is obsolete because it is based on an older  </s>
<s> version of Unicode which the UTC would prefer people not use.  </s>
<s> The preferred charsets that applications should use are UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE.  </s>
<s> Their definition and usage recommendations are in the Internet Draft draft-hoffman-utf16-02.txt.  </s>
<s> Is it possible to deprecate or invalidate an existing, registered character set?  </s>
<s> What process would be involved?  </s>
<s> Should we be looking at some other process to discourage use of "unicode-1-1"?  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance,  </s>

<s> You have to identify what RFCs reference this version which is to be deprecated, and ideally update those RFCs by writing one new RFC which updates all of these, identifying what they should do.  </s>
<s> I.e. an RFC can update (not replace) a whole bunch of other RFCs.  </s>
<s> That happens now and then for clearifications etc.  </s>
<s> I see this as one of these situations when an update is ok.  </s>
<s> The process is because of that: + Someone checks the RFCs existing for references that will be wrong + Check more carefully if the change have impact on the RFC itself + Write one Internet-Draft about the two above things.  </s>
<s> I.e. about how and what version of UNICODE to use at the moment -- and clearify what impact it had on old protocols.  </s>
<s> + Let me know that the Internet-Draft is published, and I'll see that it become an RFC, via the normal process.  </s>
<s> If the impact on a certain RFC is "not negliable", the RFC itself might have to be replaced by a new one, but this descision have to be made in step 2 above.  </s>

<s> Based on my search of the RFC database, the following RFCs refer to "unicode-1-1": RFC 1945: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0 It's one of the listed character sets for HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 Ditto.  </s>
<s> RFC 1700: ASSIGNED NUMBERS The charset database.  </s>
<s> RFC 1641: Using Unicode with MIME The original registration.  </s>
<s> None of these seem like they would cause a problem by being obsoleted.  </s>
<s> Deborah Goldsmith Manager, International Toolbox Group Apple Computer, Inc. goldsmith@apple.com  </s>
<s> Yes, but RFC 1945 is an "Informational" RFC that noted the current practice of HTTP/1.0 at the time it was written.  </s>
<s> There is no process for "updating" it, and no need.  </s>
<s> Actually, no. "unicode-1-1" appears in RFC 2068 only in an example, and the example is used to demonstrate the use of "q" factors to indicate preference.  </s>
<s> In the example in RFC 2068, "unicode-1-1" is demonstrated as having a lower preference: Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8 so I don't think there's anything wrong with RFC 2068.  </s>
<s> It appeared in RFC 1945 in a list of enumerated values, but that was changed when we went to Proposed Standard.  </s>
<s> Even obsoleted charset designations should retain their assigned numbers, so that updated software can know when it receives data that uses the obsoleted charset.  </s>
<s> RFC 1700 notes clearly that it is a "snapshot" of the online documentation, and does not need any updating.  </s>
<s> Actually, it seems that none of these require any updating at all.  </s>
<s> All that's necessary is to note in the charset registration itself that "Unicode-1-1" is obsoleted.  </s>
<s> At the moment IANA doesn't register anything about the state of a character set, unlike the MIME type registry, where it can be marked as COMMON, DEPRECATED or LIMITED USE.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should introduce the same labels in the charset registry?  </s>

<s> I am in favour of that.  </s>

<s> So am I; I'll make sure it is added to the document the next time it is revised (hopefully soon).  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
<s> Very much in favor, too.  </s>
<s> Would help a lot!  </s>
