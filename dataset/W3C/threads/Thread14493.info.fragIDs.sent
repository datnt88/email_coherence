<s> It's an example of a form with error messages.  </s>
<s> The trick is that there are links between the errors.  </s>
<s> It actually is an example of an "electronic curb cut" where the design was originally to help blind users to more quickly correct errors on a form, but sighted users have also found it helpful too.  </s>

<s> Hi. I found the link that was a question mark confusing - I expected it to provide some kind of help but it just sent me to the top of the page.  </s>
<s> Since I suffer from an over-use injury I would prefer not to have so many links included that do not do anything obviously useful.  </s>
<s> I could not submit the form so don't know what happens if you do.  </s>
<s> This is a case where dynamically generating a response (and having a client side script perform the validation where they are supported) could be a good answer.  </s>
<s> As a separate comment, the table of availability was quite difficult to use.  </s>

<s> Hi, Charles I'm sorry.  </s>
<s> You may have missed the point of the example.  </s>
<s> The page just shows how fields on a form which have errors can be linked together as a way to more quickly navigate through them.  </s>
<s> The ?  </s>
<s> link was only to show help for each table entry.  </s>
<s> (I believe it should have displayed a message about not finding something.) The form submission was turned off since I only wanted to show the pagge itself.  </s>
