Hi, I can't remember if I ever sent this out. 
It's an example of a form with error messages. 
The trick is that there are links between the errors. 
It actually is an example of an "electronic curb cut" where the design was originally to help blind users to more quickly correct errors on a form, but sighted users have also found it helpful too.

Hi. I found the link that was a question mark confusing - I expected it to provide some kind of help but it just sent me to the top of the page. 
Since I suffer from an over-use injury I would prefer not to have so many links included that do not do anything obviously useful. 
I could not submit the form so don't know what happens if you do. 
This is a case where dynamically generating a response (and having a client side script perform the validation where they are supported) could be a good answer. 
As a separate comment, the table of availability was quite difficult to use.

Hi, Charles I'm sorry. 
You may have missed the point of the example. 
The page just shows how fields on a form which have errors can be linked together as a way to more quickly navigate through them. 
The ? 
link was only to show help for each table entry. 
(I believe it should have displayed a message about not finding something.) The form submission was turned off since I only wanted to show the pagge itself.
