This has the potential to cause some problems because such information in an ALT attribute would be useless to the visually impared user and would just frustrate the text-only browsing user. 
I'd like to suggest that something stating that ALT attributes should contain meaningful content and not filename or image size or it should have nothing in it (i.e. ALT=""). 
Thoughts?? B.K. DeLong 360 Huntington Ave.

That would be advisable. 
The default Alt="" tag in Microsoft Frontpage is the file name and file size. 
A requirement to include a substantive description of the image would be much more beneficial. 
Scott Lay University of California, Davis School of Law scottlay@davis.com 
Current Project: "The Application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the World Wide Web" The current techniques document says: Alternative text (Alt-text) Alternative text represents the function of the content. 
Alternative text should not describe visual appearance or how something sounds. 
For example, if an image of a magnifying glass is used for a search button, the alt-text would be "Search" rather than "Magnifying glass". 
Quicktest! 
A good test to determine if alternative text is useful is to imagine reading the document aloud over the telephone. 
What would you say upon encountering this image to make the page comprehensible to the listener? 
Does this do what you ask for?

To a degree....I still believe this should be an item on the checklist rather than a technique. 
The corresponding checklist item to the technique you psted is basically "all images should contain alternative text." 
The guidelines already contain a checklist point stating that links need to be tearse but meaningful....I don't see why the ALT attribute cannot be included. 
Besides, the techniques section is for people who aren't well-versed in HTML. 
After I read that all of my images, client-side imagemaps, image buttons, and applets/objects need alternative text, I'm going to go and add it...not look at the techniques....or I'm going to e-mail the company who produces my authoring tool and ask why they default to the image filename and size when this is not the purpose of the ALT attribute. 
Good ideas, though Kynn :) Thanks for your response.

OK, here's my two cents worth (going for five cents)! 
I'm blind, and find it very frustrating to here "picture" or "foo.jpg" or "bullet" or any such nonsense. 
The "bullet" doesn't work because its too verbose; the other examples don't work because they are functionally inappropriate. 
In short, authoring tools might support two modes: strict accessibility checking, and relaxed accessibility checking. 
Strict would *always prompt* for an alt-text string; relaxed might use a default (null might be preferable here). 
Note that if the image is an anchore (clickable), relaxed mode and strict mode may be equivalent, basically forcing the designer to put some description on the anchor.

If you give the author an option to leave these blank (null) then the links may not be visible at to a blind user No...my reasoning for adding an option to leave the ALT attribute blank is because many Web developers and Authoring Tools use invisible "spacer" graphics for the purpose of layout. 
Perhaps when the user chooses a null option, a prompt will say "Are you sure? 
People who use text-browsers, have images turned off, or visually impared users using screen readers will not be able to see this image." 
I don't want to belabor this point... 
I think null tags are fine, but I think the authoring tool should know when the image in question is a link, and if it is, refuse to put a null tag on it. 
Maybe I'm missing something here, but do designers use these spacer graphics as links? 
I think null is the best alt string for many many situations, just not for links!

UNSUBSCRIBE PLEASE THANK YOU MIKE F. P.S. I can't replicate any errors viewing glassdog in Netscape 4.5 (and, for the record, no, it was designed to work in all current browser releases) - What error does it report? 
Lance I am using MSIE 4.01 and this is the message I get when I call up your site and subsequent pages on it. 
line: 16 char: 1 error: 'parent.ad.document' is not an object code: 0 On Netscape 4.05 this message comes up: JavaScript Error: http://www.alistapart.com/stories/lance.html 
line 16: parent.ad 
has no properties. 
I couldn't get the page to open in Opera 3.05. 
On Lynx it came up okay. 
Joyce Read the Story. 
Personally, I loved it. 
Lemme explain. 
Most of the stuff I produce is extremely dull. 
I don't use stylesheets in my own work because I don't care what it looks like. 
I don't use TABLE formatting and Font tagging and stuff (much) because I don't care what it looks like and that is like using a bottle opener as a monkey wrench - it works, a bit, but it is a silly thing to do unless it is really important. 
Innovation is a fantastic thing. 
Without it there would be no screen readers, no speech input systems, and no web to use them on. 
What I got out of Lance's article was the suggestion that in our own space we should play. 
Innovate. 
Try things out. 
That was explicit. 
What seemed implicit was that the purpose of a working website is to transmit information, and that it is important that all users can get that information. 
Seems to sum up a lot of what WAI is trying to achieve. 
After all, unless people play with accessible Java, SMIL, CSS, labelling bureaus for undescribed images, rating schemes for accessibility, and the myriad other things that may help to make the web a better place, they will not happen. 
What I did not get out of the article was the suggestion that accessibility is not important. 
If that is the real message, which I missed, then I am foolish and Lance is a complete goose. 
Charles PS I read the article with Lynx. 
I guess by the time Lynx gets a Javascript interpreter people will be writing more stable scripts, having played with stuff that doesn't really work for long enough to get the real thing right. 
I hope so - I am very fond of Lynx, but I am going to need to be able to interpret more varieties of active content at some stage. 
Maybe I'll need to learn a bit more programming and wor out how to add a Java interpreter as well. 
Now that I have figured out how to get Lynx to display images when I really need it to.
