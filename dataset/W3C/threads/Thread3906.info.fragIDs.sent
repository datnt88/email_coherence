<s> Lorrie, late but hopefully not too late: my 2 cents after re-reading the draft.  </s>
<s> On Element opturi (attribute of POLICY element)  </s>
<s> It currently says: Find out how to opt-out at [with link to opturi] But the opturi can also be a uri to opt-in.  </s>
<s> By standardizing the text above, we prevent the expression of opturi as opt-in  </s>
<s> It says: We give you access to all of our information that identifies you  </s>
<s> I'm a bit reluctant with my pigeon-english to comment here, but there might be data attached to a record of a natural person that does not identify this person but just enhances the profile.  </s>
<s> What about:  </s>
<s> We give you access to all of our information about you  </s>
<s> Hmm.. reading further in ACCESS, there is a mixture of "identifies you" and "information about you".  </s>
<s> This could be canonicalized for better understanding.  </s>
<s> it says often "[display long description and short description, if provided, with hyperlink to service URI]" shouldn't we provide a default in the absence of such a description?  </s>
<s> This could resolve some of the concerns of David Stampley, as we might say: If other dispute resolutions have failed, you could ultimately go to court with your case (which is always true ;) This makes more sense for law / .  </s>
<s> Your rights are ultimately protected by law.  </s>
<s> I agree with the concerns of David Stampley concerning the law / element.  </s>
<s> it says: "We do not keep any information that could be used to identify you personally" But in fact, this is a question of retention.  </s>
<s> Non-identifiable means:  </s>
<s> We do not collect any information that could be used to identify you  </s>
<s> personally The rest is okay.  </s>
<s> I did not find any further thing that would merit a  </s>
<s> comment.  </s>
<s> So I consider this already very good.  </s>
<s> Rigo  </s>
<s> Lorrie posted a revised matrix and has invited public comments by 13 August.  </s>
<s> This will allow us to make another pass at revisions by the end of August so they can be incorporated in the next browser releases.  </s>
<s> Nope, not too late.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments!  </s>
<s> Maybe we should change to "Find out how to opt-in or opt-out at"  </s>
<s> The definition of all/ is restricted to "identified data" so "about you" seems to broad?  </s>
<s> The service URL is always required, so maybe that should be the default  </s>
<s> The definition of this element includes both the case that the info is not collected and the case that it is collected but anonymized before being stored.  </s>
<s> That's why we use the term "keep" rather than "collect."  </s>
<s> What about opt-in/out (shorter ;)  </s>
<s> But I find the 'identifies' a bit difficult because they have that  </s>
<s> profile and now it identifies me ;). 'about you' is much more natural  </s>
<s> and semantically works well with what we want to express.  </s>
<s> What you mean is more of 'might be able to find out about you', which would work with 'identifiable'.  </s>
<s> DISPUTES  </s>
<s> What text?  </s>
<s> A URI has no meaning here..  </s>
<s> Just say 'for disputes click here'?  </s>
<s> ;)  </s>
<s> NON-IDENTIFIABLE  </s>
<s> In this case, non-identifiable and non-ident are semantically equal expressions in the user-interface.  </s>
<s> That's what I want to prevent as non-identifiable is really much stronger as non-ident in retention.  </s>
<s> Remember, non-ident is only about  </s>
<s> identified data and not identifiable data.  </s>
<s> Best, Rigo  </s>
<s> But not very meaningful.  </s>
<s> I agree that "about you" sounds better.  </s>
<s> But semantically it is wrong.  </s>
<s> You have it backwards.  </s>
<s> What I mean is information that we have identified with you (identified, not identifiable).  </s>
<s> NON-IDENTIFIABLE  </s>
<s> Well the semantic difference should be that non-ident is about "identified" data  </s>
<s> and non-identifiable is about "identifiable" data.  </s>
<s> I think the user  </s>
<s> interface expressions we are proposing make the correct distinction.  </s>
<s> If you want to change "keep" somewhere, arguably it would be better to change the "keep" in "nonident" to "collect" since that's the word used in the definition -- but I think its ok the way it is.  </s>
<s> Lorrie  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> ACCESS all /  </s>
<s> I think we are on the same side in what we want to express :) 'Identified with you' sounds more like what I meant, but doesn't it look like too much of data protection talk if we say 'identified with you'?  </s>
<s> NON-IDENTIFIABLE  </s>
<s> I've re-read the sections and I think it is ok the way it is.  </s>
<s> But still the only distinction between 'could identify you' and identified information (we might have identifiable information) is a bit weak.  </s>
<s> Best, Rigo  </s>
