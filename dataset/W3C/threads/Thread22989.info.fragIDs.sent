<s> The DOM Level 2 spec has this to say about Document.getElementById():  </s>
<s> "Note: The DOM implementation must have information that says which attributes are of type ID. Attributes with the name "ID" are not of type ID unless so defined.  </s>
<s> Implementations that do not know whether attributes are of type ID or not are expected to return null."  </s>
<s> I'm surprised by that last sentence, and I'd like to know whether that is actually how things are implemented in practice.  </s>

<s> I doubt that those browsers are actually going out and parsing a DTD to determine the type of each attribute, but I'd also really be surprised if they don't just make getElementById() work with attributes named "ID".  </s>
<s> In practice, this seems like too important a method to break over a technicality like this.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested to hear from anyone who can comment on how this issue is actually being handled in practice.  </s>

<s> How do you express the term 'ID' in non-english languages?  </s>
<s> Obviously the answer depends on that language, and we shouldn't make any assumptions or enforce a language-specific identifier.  </s>
<s> This is why DTDs (or whatever) allow for an attribute to be defined as an identifying attribute, rather than some special 'ID' named attribute.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, someone may define a document where they're using the name ID for something other than a unique identifier, and the case may be that the ID value is duplicated in the same document, this would break the behavior of getElementById.  </s>

<s> For document.getElementById() to work in Mozilla/Netscape6+ when document is an XML document you do indeed need to tell mozilla what attributes are ID's (and due to bugs in mozilla you need to do this in the internal subset).  </s>
