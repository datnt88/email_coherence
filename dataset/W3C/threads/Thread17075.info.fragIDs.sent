<s> Would you prefer your news read by a newscaster you know or a machine?  </s>
<s> Many of our users have a visual impairment, and may also have a cognitive one.  </s>
<s> Our students undoubtedly prefer recorded audio at the present time, as do children.  </s>
<s> Ours have experience of listening and understanding human speech impediments.  </s>
<s> Children don't, in the main.  </s>
<s> It remains true that screen readers may appear to offer convenience, if you have the funds available, the ability to configure and use one, and the intelligence to understand what is being read.  </s>
<s> In any other case an alternative solution may be preferable.  </s>

<s> I can elaborate on the customers' belief, only in so far as I understand it (and yes, I've asked).  </s>
<s> Here's what I know: A Deputy Director heard about text-to-speech, and thought that meant "recorded audio," and directed her staff to investigate the idea of pushing all her department's content in both written and recorded audio formats.  </s>
<s> Those staff then directed their research on the subject of her literal request (rather than focusing on the spirit of her intent).  </s>
<s> I've never heard of anyone anywhere ever using recorded audio versions of written content in an effort to improve accessibility for the visually impaired community.  </s>
<s> Was wondering if anyone else has.  </s>
<s> sb  </s>
<s> Can you explain more about why your customers believe there is value in recorded audio?  </s>
<s> It may be that I am missing something particular to your case.  </s>

<s> Just an FYI: On my site www.accessibleware.org  </s>
<s> I use a plug-in from BrowseAloud.  </s>
<s> Once the  </s>
<s> site is enabled, and you have downloaded the plug-in, you can "hear" the site.  </s>
<s> It requires you to move the mouse or I assume tab, to get over the sentence/line of text, and then you can "hear" it.  </s>
<s> The person to reach at BrowseAloud is Garry Morrison g.morrison@texthelp.com .  </s>
<s> Let me know how that works out.  </s>

<s> the  </s>
<s> In most cases, providing the unedited audio is the cheap option for these stations, and it is producing the transcript that is expensive.++  </s>
<s> For most businesses, producing audio of acceptable standard is expensive, because it normally requires that they hire an actor or professional radio presenter to do the recording, and possibly the services of a recording studio.  </s>
<s> These are capital expenditure items, so require business cases and high level approval.  </s>
<s> Using an amateur recording on an otherwise glossy web site would not be considered acceptable, even for a minority audience.  </s>
<s> In the commercial world, in the absence of legislation, if you spend more on one feature, you spend less on others.  </s>
<s> In most cases, the ability to navigate the audio from an internet radio station would be considered commercially undesirable, for reasons that are a long way from the ideals of the internet.  </s>
<s> I think that is one of the reasons why streaming audio is so much preferred, even for audio on demand material.  </s>
<s> If you look at the documentation for Microsoft Media Server, you will discover what the product is really about is the delivery of commercial breaks, not the entertainment content.  </s>
<s> I was trying to watch a foreign TV station that had inband subtitles (their language), and I wondered if it was possible for them to tweak the video encoder to give priority to the subtitles, but that sort of thing is just not what Media Server is about.  </s>
<s> Of course, even if the tools existed, their priorities might not allow for paying someone to hint the encoding.  </s>
<s> I suspect that is when they are using it for entertainment, not when  </s>
<s> seeking information.  </s>
<s> At least in the original web concept, such material is a leaf resource, and it is the pages used to get to it that require the real accessibility features.  </s>
<s> For a commercial developer, even continuous speech recording is expensive, but the short segments, needed to construct a navigations structure, are even more difficult to do well and not sound like an automated attendant at a call centre.  </s>
<s> For charities and public services, bandwidth tends to be the expensive item for speech.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, coming back to the real reasons for internet radio (the BBC  </s>
<s> is probably strange in this respect) it's generally reccommended that one use music recordings for the elderly with congnitive disabilities, because the commercial breaks, on live radio, confuse them; how well do your clients cope with commercials?  </s>
<s> ++ Transcripts of broadcasts are useful for language learners, as well as the deaf and those accessing from their office, where there are no sound cards and the firewall blocks the streaming audio.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately I don't know of a radio station that produces content for  </s>
<s> the deaf community, although I hope some do.  </s>
<s> It has been seriously suggested in the WCAG group that Internet radio should be allowed to claim that they conform to accessibility guidelines despite completely failing to serve the needs of the Deaf community.  </s>
<s> I hope this doesn't happen - there may be grounds for exempting them from legal requirements in some policy frameworks, but to say they are accessible is simply wrong.  </s>
<s> I prefer my news read by a newscaster I know, but I also prefer to have a drink with him, and that reduces the amount of time he has for recording all the material I want to listen to.  </s>
<s> In that case I prefer  </s>
<s> to listen to a high-quality voice on my machine.  </s>
<s> Living on a modem connection as I do, recorded audio of equivalent quality takes too long to download and the bandwidth doesn't allow for reliable and comprehensible streaming.  </s>
<s> Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe all your students prefer recorded audio to generated audio, and that they all have a cognitive disability.  </s>
<s> I realise that there are other users of your site in the wide world who have a visual disability and no known cognitive disability.  </s>
<s> For people who use screen readers, recorded audio is often an inconvenience.  </s>
<s> For people who find high-quality audio helpful, screen readers are often too expensive or too difficult to set up (there are four or five available in linux, and you can get distributions of linux that come preconfigured with screenreaders, free, but they currently tend to work in line-mode.  </s>
<s> The work on GNOME and Mozilla accessibility (largely funded by Sun, I believe) holds a lot of promise for free graphical and speaking systems.  </s>
<s> WebSound, which has been hidden for some time but I believe is about to reappear, was a very good step towards a better solution.  </s>
<s> Currently we have a genuine conflict in the needs of people.  </s>
<s> A possibility in the short term is to use a system like Annotea that provides pointers to audio versions of content for people who want them, and can be installed as a plugin to browsers (there are annotea clients available for IE, Mozilla, Amaya, command-line systems, and servers available for virtually any system).  </s>
<s> I believe the answer lies in better development of technology, not in recording everything.  </s>
<s> One of the areas that is not currently easy, but should be in a few years, is to have better control over whether you use your local speech synthesis or get a high-quality version from somewhere else, and another is the ability to sythesise a particular person's voice (more or less...).  </s>

<s> I had a look at your website using a speech-enabled browser (the majority of browsers on the Macintosh are speech enabled already, but this is not good enough for serious work if someone has a visual disability).  </s>
<s> I went to the browsealoud site to look at the plugin, and it appears to only work on windows.  </s>
<s> I wasn't prepared to hand over my email address without any reference to a privacy policy, and with a promise that I would get advertising email, so I didn't download the plugin.  </s>
<s> Reading the documentation it also appears to rely heavily on people seeing various cues, and then using the mouse to control various features.  </s>
<s> Neither of these are things that people who are blind can do effectively except with the aid of a very powerful and carefully configured screen reader - at which point they have no need for the browsealoud plugin.  </s>
<s> I think this is not a very effective approach - there are numerous free speaking browsers for multiple systems, and people who want one should get one for themselves that works with all web content.  </s>
<s> Expecting people to download each required plugin for the system that each site developer chose leads to mass confusion for users, incompatibility problems for site developers, and a lot of time wasted all around - if this approach was the best one I would recommend using Flash objects, since at least there is a widely installed user base.  </s>
<s> Given that this approach is most helpful to people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities one of the most important things is making sure there aren't complex download and configuration requirements placed on users.  </s>
<s> (By the way, I currently don't recommend using flash - except as a possible format for an audio file that is not necessary and that the user can choose to play or not.  </s>
<s> I think there are other formats for audio that are as well suited to the task - mp3, wav, etc).  </s>
