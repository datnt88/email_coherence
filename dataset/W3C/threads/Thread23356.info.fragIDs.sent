<s> Why does this method, when no second argument is specified, append the child?  </s>

<s> Opportunity for added functionality aside, consider that a loop to add elements to the end of a list is simple:  </s>
<s> for( i = 0; i  len; i++ ) node.appendChild( list[ i ] ); Whether the node begins empty or not.  </s>

<s> list[ i ] ); else node.insertBefore( list[ i ], last ); While I realize the for loop could be optimized, that's not the point.  </s>
<s> There are many varied cases where objects must be repeatedly added to any number of lists, which may or may not be empty at the time.  </s>
<s> The call may not happen directly inside of a for loop, but several methods down, the top-most being called in such a loop, etc.  </s>
<s> Why not make this call as simple as: node.insertBefore( list[ i ] );  </s>

<s> node.insertBefore(list[i], node.firstChild());  </s>
<s> ok there are two method calls instead of only one but I think this is acceptable (and inserting at the beginning of the list is IMHO less common than appending) -- luca  </s>
<s> child?  </s>
<s> The next-sibling of the last sibling is null.  </s>
<s> Hence, insert-before null is taken as a request to insert at that point.  </s>
<s> Did we have to support that behavior?  </s>
<s> No. But it's cheap and easy to implement, it makes sense when you understand the rationalle, and it makes some kinds of code a trifle easier to write.  </s>
<s> Would you really have preferred that we throw a null pointer exception?  </s>
<s> (It's far too late to change it, in any case.)  </s>
<s> We have something like that.  </s>
<s> Rather than using a list to hold your nodes, make them children of a DocumentFragment node, which has the magic property that inserting/appending it actually inserts/appends its children.  </s>
