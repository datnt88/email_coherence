Hi, As I've been looking at dynamically generated web pages and what would be helpful for screen readers, I've been basically following these steps: 1. gather information by observing screen reader users work with web pages and interviewing them 2. extract key aspects from the information gathered 3. develop a prototype 4. have people use the prototype and get feed back. 
5. refine prototype and get more feedback. 
repeat as needed. 
6. demonstrate technical feasibility Software / product development generally follow steps similar to this. 
I'm wondering if there is something about these steps which are not compatible with developing the guidelines? 
Scott The focus on only testing with screenreaders leads to a potential for following a dead-end path too easily, since the guidelines are required to provide solutions tht work for people with all disabilities. 
The prototype development should take account of other accessibility requirements. 
Otherwise, this is indeed a sensible approach.

Scott W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Hi, Charles One of the current problems is that there has been very little research into identifying what features screen reader users need to use a web without any concern about other disabilities. 
Since my focus has been on dynamically generated web pages, the technology supports creating individualized web pages so there is no need to worry about other disabilities. 
Various people have indicated that choosing a particular format from a set of choices is acceptable. 
For example, I believe that Gregory has indicated he prefers the text version of the New York Times because it better meets his needs and he can get the same information as is made available in the other format. 
Scott Scott, I would think that the problem with your solution is that a single prototype isn't going to include ALL members of the addressed group. 
When developing a product, somewhere along the line, a decision is made as to the people who will and will not be served by the product, and the prototype follows this mission. 
Guidelines cannot be restricted to a small definition of the prototype of a disabled person, no matter which, or how many disabilities they are affected by. "Common wisdom" of what the visually impaired folks, those with limited vision "need", yet I know some online "visually impaired" folks who would be bored if the web were limited to their presumed "needs". 
Another presumption is that "learning disabled" folks are accommodated by including more white space and omitting animations, yet despite the fact that I've a career full and family full of LD folks, not a one of them is drawn to web pages with "more white space"... yuck!.. and several seek out the animations as the reason the web is worth $20 a month! 
If a prototype is clearly impossible for the learning disabled and the visually impaired, is there a group of disabled persons for which is IS possible? 
Even tho there are many blind folks who use screen readers with synthesized speech, how many more blind folks would come online if they could access natural human speech instead of synthesized??? Anne Anne pages Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation Hi, Ann I didn't mean to convey the idea that a single prototype will include all members of an addressed group. 
The strategies can vary and depend on the purpose of protyping. 
Prototyping can be helpful to point out holes in guidelines. 
I believe that you are jumping to conclusions. 
There is a difference between "Common wisdom" and asking blind users what they need.
