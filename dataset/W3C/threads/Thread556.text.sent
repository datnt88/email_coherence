I would like to be able to hide optional end tags (e.g. /p ), but preserve the html , head , and body tags. 
This is what I thought "hide-endtags" meant. 
Eric Eric, if you specify the --hide-endtag option and not select XHTML output, optional end tags are obmitted. 
Which options did you use? 
Out of curiousity, why would you want to suppress the optional end tags? 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Good point, the option name is a misnomer, it doesn't hide end tags, it hides optional tags and the p end tag is as optional as the html, head, body and tbody start and end tags. 
I am sorry, but Tidy is not able to do what you wish.
