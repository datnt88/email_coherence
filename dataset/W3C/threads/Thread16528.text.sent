FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Nuala Forde NEW ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS ADOPTED FOR STATE WEB SITE Rock Regan, Chief Information Officer of the State Department of Information Technology (DOIT), announced an initiative to improve the accessibility of the state web site (www.state.ct.us) to people with disabilities, including more than 100,000 state residents with visual impairment. 
Under the initiative, state agencies having a presence on the state's website, ConneCT, will incorporate the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0, which are among the most stringent accessibility standards available today. 
The new policy takes effect July 26, 2000, the tenth anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
"When the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law ten years ago, the internet as we know it today did not exist," Regan said. 
"Today it is an everyday tool for delivery of information and government services." 
The ConneCT web site was established in 1996 and receives more than 11,500 visits per day, or 29 million per year. 
On the site, citizens can download over 240 forms to apply for licenses, permits and registrations through Connecticut's Licensing Information Center. 
The site offers thousands of pages of useful information, from state park locations to public health reports. 
"The internet will be increasing in importance as we continue to lay the groundwork for statewide e-government," Regan said. 
"We must work to ensure people with visual impairment and other populations with disabilities have access to this important resource." 
Under the initiative, planned by the ConneCT Management Advisory Committee (CMAC), agency webmasters will work to ensure web site content adheres to these new standards and that existing content be upgraded by January 1, 2002. 
DOIT, in conjunction with CMAC, is organizing training for state webmasters in the use of the W3C standards. 
Regan commended the work of CMAC'S Accessibility Subcommittee, chaired by Kathleen Anderson of the Office of State Comptroller Nancy Wyman. 
The subcommittee worked with the Board of Education and Services for the Blind (BESB), the Office of Protection and Advocacy, the Connecticut State Library, and other agency representatives in formulating the new standards. 
The state web site is managed by the CMAC, a unique collaborative effort between agencies and organizations across all three branches of Connecticut state government. 
"Since 1995, accessibility standards have been in place and continuously refined," said John Forbes, Chairman of CMAC. 
"This is the next step to ensure Connecticut is being vigilant in opening up the web to all populations."

Hello Kathleen, I'm curious about one particular aspect of the policy mentioned in the press release you forwarded. 
The press release talked about more than 240 forms people can download to apply for licenses, registrations and permits. 
What formats will these forms have to be in under this policy? 
If PDF or some other graphical form, how will people with disabilities complete these forms under the policy? 
Thanks, Kelly Hi Kelly: It's too soon to tell; the policy was the 'what' - implementation is the 'how' and 'when' - that's our next step. 
I believe there is a pilot program going on here at the state using a product called OmniForm - it allows you to save forms in HTML format and you can add JavaScript for validation. 
That might be an option. 
Do you have any suggestions for us to pursue?
