<s> Hello Addison, I hope your flight situation clears up soon.  </s>
<s> I propose that we hold a short meeting.  </s>
<s> I can chair if nobody else wants to do it.  </s>
<s> I also propose that we slide our bi-weekly schedule to have a meeting next week, and then again in three weeks, and so on.  </s>
<s> This will avoid collisions with the various WG meetings around the W3C Technical Plenary in two weeks.  </s>

<s> Sorry I missed it.  </s>
<s> I was shoveling snow and lost track of time.  </s>
<s> Martin's suggestion is a good one.  </s>
