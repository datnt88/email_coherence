<s> Well, you're between a rock and a hard place.  </s>
<s> If you can get the number from the counter people (some counters will do this) then you could include it using a text object, or some kind of server-side script, as alternative content.  </s>
<s> If not, the information cannot be accessed except through an image.  </s>
<s> Which is a pretty good solid reason declaring it to be inaccessible.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is a shame.  </s>
<s> Technologically it is fairly easy to put couting into your own page.  </s>
<s> But it requires cooperation between the page author and the service provider, which is not always forthcoming.  </s>
