<s> Without getting into the use case behind this, I read both the latest public working draft and the current working draft as saying that in the following: and $foo will be assigned equivalent nodes from the source document (in particular, if the result is some descendant of the root, then I can apply parent or ancestor axes and get the same results).  </s>

<s> No: the latter case constructs a temporary tree.  </s>
<s> To return a value from the source document, you need an "as" attribute, thus: If that's the case, is it further the case (here's the real interesting part) that I can put the xsl:sequence in a template, i.e., and, once again, get back an equivalent node?  </s>
<s> Yes, you can do this.  </s>
<s> Again, you need the "as" attribute on xsl:variable.  </s>

<s> Michael, Thank you for responding to quickly.  </s>
<s> I am please as punch that this is possible.  </s>
<s> The logic behind using "as", though, is completely opaque to me.  </s>
