<s> In section 12.2 of the WD, the last paragraph says that NaNs are less than any other value (including -INF).  </s>
<s> This conflicts with the XML Schema Data Model description (sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5), with which XSLT is supposed to conform, that says that NaNs are greater than all other values (including +INF).  </s>
<s> So, we have two incompatible specs (3 if you count the IEEE 754 spec, which says a third thing about NaNs).  </s>

<s> In the XPath 2.0 WD, in the Appendix, Section A.2 Precedence Order, the precedence of various comparisons are all listed with equal values (4).  </s>
<s> This seems different from XPath 1.0 (Section 3.4), which has Relational Expressions at higher priority than Equality Expressions.  </s>
<s> Is this intentional?  </s>
<s> If so, it has been left out of Appendix F, which lists known incompatibilities between 1.0 and 2.0.  </s>

<s> Thanks for pointing this out.  </s>
<s> This is still true in the August drafts.  </s>
<s> I don't know of any particular reason why this has changed from 1.0, and at the very least, it should be documented as an incompatibility.  </s>
<s> By copying this message to the XPath TF, I am requesting that we register this as an issue.  </s>

<s> Yes, the discrepancy is unfortunate.  </s>
<s> The XSLT rule that NaN precedes other values (note that this only applies to xsl:sort) was introduced as an erratum to XSLT 1.0 (see E20 in publication of XML Schema, which adopted the opposite convention.  </s>
<s> It's not obvious whether the problem is serious enough to be worth fixing, and if so, how it should be fixed: as far as I can see it is untidy that the two specs should adopt different conventions but it does not make anything actually break.  </s>
