Hi, this report concerns Amaya 8.4 (GTK) on Debian 3.0 on an x86 machine. 
In fact, I downloaded the debian package from chokes when reading a 'font-family' statement when the font name contains whitespace and is not quoted. 
If I read the CSS spec correctly, not quoting such a font name is correct. 
To reproduce, open regards, Daniel Skorka 
The following is from the TR for CSS 2.1... If an unquoted font family name contains parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, they must still be either balanced or escaped per CSS grammar rules. 
Similarly, quote marks, semicolons, exclamation marks and commas within unquoted font family names must be escaped. 
Font names containing any such characters or whitespace should be quoted: Since one of the families used is Courier New it must be quoted due to the whitespace character !!!
