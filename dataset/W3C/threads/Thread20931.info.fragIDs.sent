<s> Hi, this report concerns Amaya 8.4 (GTK) on Debian 3.0 on an x86 machine.  </s>
<s> In fact, I downloaded the debian package from chokes when reading a 'font-family' statement when the font name contains whitespace and is not quoted.  </s>
<s> If I read the CSS spec correctly, not quoting such a font name is correct.  </s>
<s> To reproduce, open regards, Daniel Skorka  </s>
<s> The following is from the TR for CSS 2.1... If an unquoted font family name contains parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, they must still be either balanced or escaped per CSS grammar rules.  </s>
<s> Similarly, quote marks, semicolons, exclamation marks and commas within unquoted font family names must be escaped.  </s>
<s> Font names containing any such characters or whitespace should be quoted: Since one of the families used is Courier New it must be quoted due to the whitespace character !!!  </s>
