<s> The regular annual wake for: "Client-side Scripting Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0" is fast approaching.  </s>
<s> Please can anyone advise me in what sense is WCAG fulfilling it scope with respect to scripting?  </s>
<s> other W3C technologies?  </s>
<s> thanks Jonathan enabling people with a severe learning difficulty to browse the web independently Congratulations on the working group logo 'b-10-family1.png' though this is perhaps not ideal as a name, how about 'working group logo.png'.  </s>
<s> Sorry not to have contributed more, perhaps its time I rejoined as an active participant.  </s>
<s> If you would like the WCAG WG to discuss a specific issue, 1. check if the issue is already in the issues list links to condensed bug report lists: we have 4 open issues related to client-side scripting: 2. If your issue is not on the issues list create a new issue in the WCAG Bugzilla database 3. Propose a solution to the issue and send it to the mailing list For example, refer to this message from Michael Cooper about using the summary attribute on Table elements.  </s>
<s> He summarizes the possibilities and proposes a solution.  </s>
<s> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0294.html  </s>
<s> Another good example: summarize the issue and raise questions that we need to answer about a particular technique: While scripting issues have not been the core of our discussions, we have been making progress.  </s>
<s> Here is an overview of what's been happening with Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs).  </s>
<s> 1. updating issues lists.  </s>
<s> all previous HTML issues have been moved to bugzilla 2. discussing open issues on Wednesday telecons and mailing list primarily addressing HTML issues, summary of those discussed in the last few weeks: - tables - alt/title/longdesc - abbr/acronym 3. designing schema and tools for techniques 4. converting old html techniques to new dtd Loretta is doing this.  </s>

<s> FWIW, server-side scripting techniques would seem to fall somewhere between both the WCAG working group and the ATAG working group.  </s>
<s> There is a fuzzy border between "a server-side process that promotes accessibility" and "an application on the server which is generating accessible content."  </s>
<s> I think this is a case where both groups need to have input and understanding, if just to know where the borders begin and end.  </s>
<s> (For example, to what degree do server-side techniques to satisfy WCAG have to comply with ATAG?  </s>
<s> At some point, this will be true -- say, a content management system a la Edapta [RIP] but it's not always true for something like mod_accessibility.  </s>
<s> This is a good topic for cross-group perspectives.) --Kynn  </s>

<s> Kynn, Yes, the border between server-side techniues and how WCAG and ATAG apply to them is fuzzy.  </s>
<s> Content Management Systems (Matt's favorite topic :) is a good, concrete example to begin the discussion between AUWG and WCAG WG.  </s>
<s> It will be interesting to hear if the AUWG talked about this relationship (between CMS, ATAG and WCAG) at their F2F meeting last week.  </s>
<s> If it hasn't been done yet, it would be interesting to list all of the issues related to CMS, accessibility, WCAG and ATAG as a starting point for a discussion.  </s>
<s> Are you interested in taking a first pass or digging up what has already been written?  </s>
<s> (Matt?) Perhaps server-side techniques could be a shared Techniques document between ATAG and WCAG or at least have entry points for each set of guidelines.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how that would work, but it could be something to consider.  </s>
<s> We've discussed joint telecons between AUWG and WCAG WG, although a particular date and time for a discussion has not been scheduled.  </s>
<s> Once we do schedule a discussion, this topic ought to be on the agenda.  </s>
<s> I've created issue #309 as a placeholder for this topic [1].  </s>

<s> Wendy, thanks for your fairly comprehensive reply, to a different question.  </s>
<s> On the positive side, The bugzilla interface looks great.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem that appropriate for shifting the whole document across though.  </s>
<s> I also have a life.  </s>
<s> Accessible scripting does need a large document the 4 open issues listed are only a few of the ones we covered, should they be dated, to give some idea of progress?  </s>
<s> Beneath each open issue there appears the following: Techniques for WCAG 2.0 | Client Side Scripting Techniques | proposal | 2003-02-12 15:29:54 | NEW | WCAG Bugzilla Issue #197 What is its purpose?  </s>
<s> they look like links but aren't, at least the last one is but when I tried to add a comment, by clicking on "WCAG Bugzilla Issue #197" I repeatedly get an 'Internal Server Error' am awaiting password(20 minutes later), to add a new topic, tried again, and this time received email changing password?? now however I get the Internal Server Error when trying to log in.  </s>
<s> tried alternate email address, new password, Internal Server Error Gave Up for today!  </s>
<s> 4 open issues, does not look like a whole lot of effort for 12 months.  </s>
<s> Is WCAG planning to contribute significant effort in the next 12 months?  </s>
<s> NB:The SVG condensed report has no open issues, shurely shome mishtake?  </s>
<s> Do you consider that WCAG is on track with regard to techniques?  </s>
<s> SVG and Scripting?  </s>
<s> Who is the lead on these?  </s>
<s> Please remember that I offered to manage development of the Scripting document, but you demurred, insisting that you were in control.  </s>
<s> Where is the evidence that you are progressing this?  </s>
<s> My apologies if this seems forceful, I only wish to see progress, and this is not readily apparent.  </s>
