In the May 5 XML Link draft, section 5.2, location source: I don't understand "referrer". 
I don't know how to interpret "the non-link element that refers to the link element." 
I assume "link element" should read "linking element" (ref. 
section 1.3), but I didn't know the linking element was necessarily referred to by anything. 
Can someone please explain this to me?

Consider this HyTime (TC) example: link href=foo a /a b b /link treeloc id=foo naimpsrc=referrer 1 2 /treeloc The treeloc addresses the second child of its location source, which is the referrer element (the Link), thus it addresses the element B. In this case there is exactly one step in the location path from the Link element to its ultimate target, so the element that refers directly to the treeloc is also the element that makes the initial reference to the location path the treeloc is in (because there is only one step in the path, the treeloc). 
Which is the location source for treeloc in the following?

In HyTime, the "referrer" is the non-*location address* element that refers to a location address. 
The distinction is necessary because the location source for a location address element may either be the referrer or defined by the referrer. 
However, only the top rung of a location ladder can have a default location source, and since the top rung will be referred to by the rung below it (unless the ladder consists of exactly one location address), we can't talk about any element referring to the location address. 
Consider this HyTime (TC) example: The treeloc addresses the second child of its location source, which is the referrer element (the Link), thus it addresses the element B. In this case there is exactly one step in the location path from the Link element to its ultimate target, so the element that refers directly to the treeloc is also the element that makes the initial reference to the location path the treeloc is in (because there is only one step in the path, the treeloc). 
If we interpose another step in the location path, we see the nomencature problem: nmsploc id=bar nmspace=elements foo /bar !-- Default locsrc is current doc -- The link points to the name-space loc, which then addresses the treeloc, forming a two-step location path, with the treeloc at the end. 
The Link element doesn't refer directly to the treeloc but is still the treeloc's referrer for the purposes of determing the implied location source of the treeloc because the Link pointed to the location path of which the treeloc is a member. 
Intermediate location addresses can't be referrers because otherwise you'd never be able to form this example. 
Cheers, E. 
After reading this a haf dozen times, I think I understand it, though I still don't see the utility of "referrer" (so a link can refer to a treeloc that can point back into the link itself?). 
But in any case, I submit that we need to do something to the XML-link spec to make this section clearer. 
(And I'm also still awaiting a respone to Terry's message on this.)
