I still don't like the fact that this document is a superset of pubrules, as this kind of duplication may lead to inconsistencies and two different standards to end up with. 
I think this manual should become the reference, with a clear indication of what is MUST, what is SHOULD and what is MAY, and I encourage you to use a checkpoint style with level of priorities like the WAI guidelines (P1 for MUST, level AA, etc). 
Pubrules would just become the LevelA. 
This would make the conformance requirement much clearer. 
I found the statement in 2. "Conformance to this manual is optional and unlike in previous versions, there are no conformance requirements." 
followed by a bunch of must quite confusing. 
The rest is less important: I think it'd be better to put all the copyright/ipr in one section instead of two as now. 
You should refer to this doc instead of the odoriferous css as a good example (and maybe making it a note). 
You should add a direct link to a list of authoring tools that support XMLspec (free or commercial). 
Where is the Manual Of Style linked from ? 
Your timing is great. 
Susan Lesch and I discussed this yesterday. 
Here is our plan, to be executed as soon as we have time: - No rules in pubrules will appear in the manual of style. 
There will be links from the m.o.s. to pubrules. 
- There will be no notion of conformance to the m.o.s. 
We will replace things like "You must have correct spelling" with "Spell-check your document." 
Why no notion of conformance? 
There's no prize or penalty for conforming! 
We'll just say what good things to do are.

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs er... pubrules is, ironically, not available to the public. 
I suggest a link to /manaul/ from Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
