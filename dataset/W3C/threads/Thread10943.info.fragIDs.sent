<s> Section 2.8: This section is really quite distasteful.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> The statement In elment content, all white space (S) is ignored seems a little odd to me!  </s>
<s> P This is odd /P P Thisisodd /P are the same?  </s>
<s> Or is "element content" being used in the SGML sense?  </s>
<s> It is defined in 3.2.2.  </s>
<s> There is one spot where it seems to be used in a different sense though, 3.1.  </s>
<s> You are right, there should probably be a forward reference to the definition in 2.8.  </s>
<s> In COLLAPSE mode, P !--* this is a comment *-- E is the same as P E but if there is an SGML parser, we get P E (right?) I don't think this will help interoperability.  </s>
<s> I don't think that there is a system that is simpler than SGML which is also 100% interoperable with SGML tools.  </s>
<s> Making all REs significant certainly wouldn't.  </s>
<s> Some SGML tools use them to format output to make it more human readable (and I like that!!!).  </s>
<s> All white space should be retained at the parser level in XML, at least ouside of a DTD.  </s>
<s> Inside a DTD I'd really hate it if a parser included the S nonterminal in parse trees!  </s>
<s> What if you are using XML documents to create DTDs (as has been agreed is  </s>
<s> reasonable)?  </s>
<s> The exact same problem afflicts people creating instance  </s>
<s> parsers as it does those working with DTDs.  </s>
<s> Some whitespace is only meant to format.  </s>
<s> If I were XML tagging this document, I would put LEE and PAUL tags around our respective content, but I would still leave a blank line between your contributions and mine for readability.  </s>

<s> Do NOT say RE when you mean newline.  </s>
<s> That is the whole source of confusion here (the fact that people look upon them as one and the same).  </s>
<s> I think have all data be significant in all cases to be a great win: especially for identity tranforms and parser validation (ie.  </s>
<s> validation of parsers).  </s>
<s> Okay.  </s>
<s> I think that the SGML spec intended for newlines to be REs (as people have attested here), but I can use a different terminology.  </s>
<s> "I don't think that there is a system that is simpler than SGML which is also 100% interoperable with SGML tools.  </s>
<s> Making all newlines significant certainly wouldn't be.  </s>
<s> Some SGML tools use them to format output to make it more human readable (and I like that!!!)." Changing the terminology does not change the facts about current tools.  </s>
<s> EBT uses these meaningless spaces and newlines all over their Website, both in content that is obviously generated by DynaWeb and content which I presume is created by hand.  </s>
<s> It is an entirely aestethic argument, but it seems to be a pervasive aestethic.  </s>
