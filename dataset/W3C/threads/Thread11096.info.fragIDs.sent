[Tim Bray:] 
In recent news, Netscape has submitted to W3C a general metadata framework for distributed information resources. 
The data model is the interesting part, but the syntax is XML. 
Allow me to belabor the obvious and point out that this Netscape proposal, taken in conjunction with similar proposals from Microsoft, means that XML is going to be the language upon which Web management will be based. 
We're in.

In recent news, Netscape has submitted to W3C a general metadata framework for distributed information resources. 
The data model is the interesting part, but the syntax is XML. 
The name is "Meta Content Framework Using XML", 
and the paper is co-authored by R.V. Guha of Netscape and by me. 
It needs namespaces, and the current draft uses the Layman syntax. 
Also it uses 
XML-link to link meta to data... gosh it's going to be nice when all these things stop moving so much and settles down. 
Anyone can look at the cover doc at w3.org; you need to be a W3C member to read the paper itself. 
If you're not, Guha tells me that it's up at home.netscape.com 
somewhere, and I've also mirrored a copy at Behind the HTML is of course an XML document, which needs a bit of cleanup but will of course be available in due course. 
Anyhow this is a first draft that doubtless will improve with input from the W3C community. 
Uh, there will be feedback, but I genuinely at the moment have no idea what the appropriate venue is - that I think is a problem for Br'er Dan Connolly.

Oh? why couldn't it use architectural forms or other processing attributes. 
I'm still waiting to see _any_ actual need for namespaces (as opposed to desire for them), and I still don't see any notion of what validity means when we can import elements into the middle of DTDs. 
We certainly don't need namespaces to make working cross-DTD markup, or else XML-link wouldn't work. 
I'm glad to see XML in use by Netscape, but I'm still waiting to see a case for inventing and standardizing a whole bunch of new practice without practical experience, or even an underlying theory of what is going on (and with less than a month to go!) . 
In addition, throwing out the notion of document validity seems a high price to pay for this
