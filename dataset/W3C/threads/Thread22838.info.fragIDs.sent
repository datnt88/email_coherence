As per the subject line: are there any WYSIWYG XML/HTML/CSS editors with a DOM based plugin API (binding language not that important, but preferably java)? 
If not, are there any vendors 
planning such a thing?

I think XMetaL fits this description. 
It uses CSS for styling and claims to expose a DOM API to scripts (I haven't checked). 
However, it is highly Windows-specific in that it uses MSIE. 
One good thing: it uses Windows Scripting Host for scripting, which means that any WSH language can be used for scripting (or so I am told). 
Personally I would use Python for this and quite simply forget about the other alternatives.

SoftQuad Software has both an HTML and an XML editor with close-to-WYSIWYG capabilities using CSS which have a DOM interface (not yet 100% Level 1, but we're getting there!) The DOM is reachable via COM, so you can use any scripting language that works with the Windows Scripting Host. 
More details at www.hotmetalpro.com, 
or www.xmetal.com.

The Emil? XML editor http://www.in-progress.com 
has a DOM1 based plugin API. 
DOM can also be used when writing scripts for the application. 
The next release of Emil? is likely to support DOM2 (I am working on it right this instance). 
The same DOM interface can also be used with our other web software, included the Interaction web server companion and XPublish XML website publishing system. 
All these applications are implemented in Common LISP and can be extended using scripts or compiled code in the same language. 
The DOM binding for Common LISP is documented at: Emil? and our other XML software are deliberately not WYSIWYG. 
I am a firm believer in separating content from presentation.

Take advantage of XML with Emile, the first XML editor for Mac! 
Arbortext also has an XML editor, Epic 3.0, that has DOM Level 1 support. 
The editor can run as a COM server to provide Windows applications access to the DOM. 
As with the others it is not WYSIWYG, but is close to WYSIWYG. 
Details are at www.arbortext.com
