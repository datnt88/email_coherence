Hi, I just downloaded the latest version of tidy and while trying to use it I got: 
"This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
You may need to move one or both of the form and /form tags. 
HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements are no exception. 
For instance you should not place the form in one table cell and the /form in another. 
If the form is placed before a table, the /form cannot be placed inside the table! 
Note that one form can't be nested inside another" First, I must point out that I used to use an older version (really old) of tidy on that same page without any pbs. 
Second, I know it's broken and that's exactly why I want to use tidy!! 
I'm not sure what led to changing tidy to behave as it does now but this defeats the whole purpose...

Using the latest version, you can use the '--force-output yes' configuration option to get a pretty printed version of the document. 
Tidy does not output anything in some cases because it is not sure how to fix the errors it encountered. 
It would be helpful to have a sample document to reproduce this behaivour and probably fix Tidy. 
regards.
