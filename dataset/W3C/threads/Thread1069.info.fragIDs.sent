<s> Hi, I just downloaded the latest version of tidy and while trying to use it I got:  </s>
<s> "This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.  </s>
<s> You may need to move one or both of the form and /form tags.  </s>
<s> HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements are no exception.  </s>
<s> For instance you should not place the form in one table cell and the /form in another.  </s>
<s> If the form is placed before a table, the /form cannot be placed inside the table!  </s>
<s> Note that one form can't be nested inside another" First, I must point out that I used to use an older version (really old) of tidy on that same page without any pbs.  </s>
<s> Second, I know it's broken and that's exactly why I want to use tidy!!  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what led to changing tidy to behave as it does now but this defeats the whole purpose...  </s>

<s> Using the latest version, you can use the '--force-output yes' configuration option to get a pretty printed version of the document.  </s>
<s> Tidy does not output anything in some cases because it is not sure how to fix the errors it encountered.  </s>
<s> It would be helpful to have a sample document to reproduce this behaivour and probably fix Tidy.  </s>
<s> regards.  </s>
