<s> [Bcc'ed to EuroAccessibility technical groups] Hi folks, one of the issues that is going to come up for the EuroAccessibility Task Force on testing tools is how to check the performance of tools for dynamic pages - for example, can a particular piece of sooftware test the 4-step process of registering for a W3C meeting, or the process of applying for a credit card online?  </s>
<s> Thre are lots of open questions about the best methodology to apply here, and particularly about how to classify the results, but I am wondering if anyone has a tool that can actually walk through the process, and how this is done.  </s>
<s> The EuroAccessibility task force is likely to look seriously at how to do this in the second half of this year (at least it is this year in Europe now :-) and having some idea now about any tools that are designed to handle this problem would be helpful.  </s>
<s> Some preliminary thoughts: javascript extensions to something that functions as a browser, or tools that have access to pprocessing back-ends, seem to me likely to have an easier time of this.  </s>
<s> Although in principle it is possible to save each page through the process and run it through a local test, it might not be that simple in practice to get all the scripts, styles, multimedia, etc. Testing this manually (without tools) should be largely possible, but it is a complex job, and it would be nice to be supported by software.  </s>

<s> Interestingly my best suggestion for this is also my oldest surviving tool, cg-eye (1997).  </s>
<s> If you go to (e.g.) offers you the opportunity to load a page containing a Form.  </s>
<s> Look at what happens when you submit the form, and we have the basis for an approach to this.  </s>
<s> Building this approach into other tools is a longstanding item on my to-do list.  </s>
<s> Just my ?0.02:-) Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Charles, I agree that supporting tests of pages that are generated on the basis of user-given data is important and complex.  </s>
<s> As you will see, LIFT Machine has some capability of specifying how forms should be filled in and therefore testing (for accessibility) the resulting pages.  </s>
<s> At the moment we don't promote it a lot since its GUI is rudimental (you have to specify in XML which form, fields and value you want to use).  </s>
<s> In the future there will be a better interface.  </s>
<s> Also, in the user's manual we say that the mechanism can be used to automate testing of login forms only.  </s>
<s> But the mechanism is more general than that.  </s>
