Dear all, I spoke at the WebxTutti (Web for All) conference in Italy last week, and thought I would send my trip report here. 
This is a personal impression, not a formal report. 
The event was well-organised - instead of the anticipated 100 people there were over 200 in the audience. 
The event was hosted by the Ministry for Communication in Rome, was free, and was advertised as providing a full day of presentations on accessibility. 
The conference was in Italian, as is the Web site launched there - http://www.webxtutti.it - which is good news for the Italian speakers of the world... 
The presentations were of a high quality, covering a good range of important topics. 
Particular personal highlights included: "No Accessibilty without Usability" Because that seems to me such an important idea. 
I don't believe that accessibility guidelines can be replaced by user testing for most people, because most developers cannot afford the time or money to find a test audience covering the huge range of users they are trying to cater for, and then do their own interpretation of their results. 
A presentation on (among other things) the XML Accessibility Guidelines - draft of shortly. 
Several presentations on assessing accessibility of different sites using a combination of methods including automatic testing and user testing. 
The announcement of "Torquemada" - http://www.webxtutti.it/testa.htm 
-an online accessibility testing tool (downloadable version promised soon) in Italian. 
Presentations are available from the site - http://www.webxtutti.it/convegno.htm - although mostly in Powerpoint or Word format. 
Thanks to the organisers of the conference. 
Cheers Charles McCN Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hello Charles, I was particularly interested in your comment about "no accessibility without usability"... 
It is exactly our philosophy ! 
We try to prove to the whole earth (lol) that accessibility and particularly technical accessibility is clearly not enough to make a good experience for the impaired users. 
If one conceive a web site keeping in mind (and use experts for) accessibility and usability, the web experience will improve for everyone ! 
What do you think about it ? 
Where can i find informations about the author of this part of the conference ? 
(in english or in french). 
Thank you J?r?me ERNU.

It is small enough so we can handle the text, I hope. 
But, it is still in Italian, so I can't get too much from it. 
Any volunteer translators?

This is an accessibility issue too. 
Think about the time and cost needed to load an attachment when your E-mail works over a GSM connection, for example, and the E-mail program has been set to download all new messages. 
Well, the first question is whether we have the original author's permission to distribute and translate the document. 
The document appears to contain interesting points, but it would probably be much more useful if expanded from lists of items to somewhat longer running text with explanations. 
Anyway, when I fed the HTML document (which has apparently been created by saving a Word document in "HTML" or "Web" format) to the Systranet translator I noticed, in addition to some other problems, that the translator was unable to translate simple words like "Sulla" in some contexts - because they were immediately preceded by bullet characters in Windows encoding, assumably confusing the translator. 
I think this illustrates how seemingly innocent tricks in markup or in the use of characters may have impact on accessibility. 
(Automatic translatability is an accessibility issue too, since it helps to get over language barriers to some extent.) Jukka Korpela, senior adviser TIEKE Finnish Information Society Development Centre I will write to the guy and ask for permission to translate (and ask that WebXTutti host the translation) to an HTML version in english. 
Chaals I think people generally prefer URLs to attachments.

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) All, You do raise some interesting points. 
I agree that I did not get permission to distribute. 
I apologize to anyone offended or concerned. 
I might have put it on a web site, but my company does not allow people like me to put anything on the web (perhaps with the indirect exception that I can create support documents that can be accessed by authorized users of our support system). 
To get things on a public web site takes a review by "Corporate Identity", and this would have included the check for authorization, as well as formatting and other reviews/requirements, one of which it probably would have failed (like, business need). 
As for the size of attachments, yes, I agree. 
This was about 24K bytes, a very small attachment in my current experience. 
I routinely have to deal with megabyte PowerPoint Slides that convey the same information content as a 1000 byte text file would. 
When I ran on a slow connection, my email tool allowed me to select not downloading attachments except explicitly. 
But, not all people run that way. 
But, in any case, if the user is to see the document, either it needs to be sent across the line as an email or as a web page. 
And, I also have the habit of not removing the text of the document to which I am replying, so these messages get increasingly long. 
And, yes, I just asked Microsoft Word 2000 to Save As HTML what was in the original Web page. 
I don't know to what HTML standard Word 2000 conforms or to what standard systranet built it's translator. 
All issues that do affect accessibility. 
Anybody following the IETF efforts to facilitate language translation? 
Dan Nissen Here is the referenced document in html. 
It is small enough so we can handle the text, I hope. 
But, it is still in Italian, so I can't get too much from it. 
Any volunteer translators? 
CMN: I have translated the document into english. 
Thanks to Michele for his permission to publish this, and for helping me clarify difficult parts of the translation. 
I have attached the HTML version and hope that it will be made available from the WebXTutti site. 
The text is below for easy reading. 
As I said I found this an interesting presentation. 
I will make a few comments on the content in a reply to this email... Chaals It isn't Accessible without Usability: For a synergy between technology and design by Michele Visciola, Etnoteam Three topics 1. 
On the relation between Accessibility and Usability 2. On the role of automatic evaluation tools and evaluation of Usability 3. On the relation between providing technology and a culture of Accessibility and Usability 1: On the relation between Accessibility and Usability + Developing for assistive technology does not resolve design problems + In particular, does not resolve Usability problems + In solving access problems technology can enable, but ultimately design determines the outcome Typical usability problems when using assistive technology + Auditory overload + Loss of context during navigation + Short-term memory overload + repetitive browsing patterns to avoid frustration and underutilization of important features and/or contents in the site Some typical factors encountered in good design with usability methodology (testing with real users above all) + Organisation of the page and of HTML attributes (e.g. ALT, LONGDESC) + Navigation method (e.g. Organisation of the links in a page) + How and when to enable skipping links or navigation bars + Optimisation of time taken for navigating to find information + Presentation of search results + Use of tables; automatically inserted data; space between links; use of acronyms and abbreviations; length of text; use of special characters (punctuation, parentheses, mathematical functions) Brief navigation demos with a screen reader + Government "gateway": www.governo.it 
+ Site designed for accessibility: http://Wai.inps.it 
+ Newspaper site: www.corriere.it 
+ Another newspaper: www.republica.it 
2: The role of Automatic Accessibility evaluation tools. 
+ Tools available today are more or less useful for identifying things that are *not accessible* + The automatic tools seem mostly oriented towards functioning with screen readers. 
They don' pay much attention to other technology - not even screen magnifiers Example of things that automatic tools can't test + Organisation of the page + Presentation of the text + Navigation methods 3: On the relation between providing technology and a culture of Accessiblity and Usability + Why are there always so many problems with interaction and problems in the interface, as if there were no guidelines? 
+ Is it really enough to rely on the goodwill of webmasters and on voluntary or special-interest groups to signal basic problems? 
Conclusions + There needs to be a real adherence to a culture of development based on user testing + It isn't enough to declare a site accessible: it has to be tested in practice and documented with empirical evidence
