Please add to this item the issue of limiting ourself to mainstream browser guidelines as a first deliverable. 
Please define "mainstream" browser for me, so I can put the definition on the issues list.

My thoughts and the group discussion has been centered on user requirements. 
Is there anyone else that supports adding Daniel's 
suggestion to the issues list for discussion?

A generic definition would be a Web UA targeted for use on a standard desktop platform with: graphical screen, keyboard, mouse, audio (I'm sure the PC industry has a definition of a standard desktop somewhere, we don't need to redefine that), primarily by non disabled users. 
A specific definition is: one of - Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer - any other that compete with these two (Opera, IBM WebExplorer, etc) A corrolary of these definitions is that a mainstream browser, as Chuck Opperman said on the list,"is often times forced on students and employees." who would otherwise use more specialized user agents best suited to their needs. 
I'm puzzled by this definition -- are you sure that you want to say "PC Platform"? 
How do you deal with WebTV? 
That's one example of a popular user agent that is not PC based, right?

That's the point: excluse things like WebTV, Web Kiosk, Voice Browser, etc from the "mainstream browser" set. 
I wouldn't want to bet that WebTV is not becoming mainstream browser -- the operative word being "becoming". 
MS and WebTV Networks are doing a huge push in that market. 
Technology convergence studies prove that the more you can move an operating environment (web/internet) to a common user interface (tv, telephone), the better the opportunities are to reach the "average" user (consumer). 
But we all know that. 
I guess you just want to deal with today -- I'd still never "pigeon-hole" myself with a narrow definition. 
But what do I know :-) - Mike 
In response to "mainstream" browser definition: I think the main problem here is determining the scope fo the guidelines. 
My impression of the consensus of the group is to define the guidelines and checkpoints based on user centered accessibility issues, rather than a mainstream browser centered problem document. 
The techniques document would be the place to talk about implementation ideas for different types of user agents (i.e. main stream, Web TV, assistive technologies, specialized browsers). 
Therefore talking about a mainstream browser does not make sense to me give the recent discussions of the group. 
If you did not participate or review the discussion on conformance and user types, please do so before responding to this discussion. 
We need to bring this "scoping" issue to a close and I propose that the next telecon we revisit this topic and try to bring it to resolution once and for all.
