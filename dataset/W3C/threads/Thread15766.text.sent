There is no such thing as universal sign language. 
Each community's sign language is a naturally formed language with it's own phonology, morphology, and syntax. 
If a Deaf American and a Deaf German meet on the street, they *won't* understand each other. 
Thank you Jess, I think I mentioned that it was the closest, LOL - how do you sign "Chicken Fried Steak" in German? 
I am more familiar with Word Order Signed English, ALS is a language in it's own - I have trouble understanding it, people from California use "SEES" and it thows me for a loop. 
I thought basic signs such as "stop", "go", "me", "eat", numbers etc were the same signs in all languages. 
But, Jess, isn't *Word-Order-Signed-English* more transferable? 
Please correct me if I am wrong, one can never know too much about such things. 
It would be an interesting experiment to use graphic images of Signs for naviagtion etc on a website except some would have to be animated gifs. 
("Home" is a 2 motion sign) or require more than one image to represent each image. 
(?) I have seen animated gifs finger-spelling words on websites, a bit too much bytes. 
But surely using these would alienate those who do not read Sign or have trouble processing Signing. 
Back to graphic symbols!! Check out Bliss Symbolics (thanks Bruce) they are very easy to learn and use: KPR, (= Kindest personal regards) LK I forgot - check out University Lyon's Sign Server: KPR, LK Yes, in agreement with Alex and Jess and Chris - each of you explained the difference between word order, ASL (and BSL), and the pros and cons of using them as "symbols" in HTML documents much more eloquectly than I could have! 
Thank you for your input. 
I agree it is getting off topic for this list - as for using Sign graphic symbols as tools on the internet it would be akin to reinventing the wheel - but is still intriging. 
I would like to continue discussing these ideas off list or if any of you can refer me to further info on or off line. 
commication difficulties (dyslexia and TMD), and to have a lively conversation with my son (who has Downs and is hearing Impaired) using 'Total Communication" is such a thrill! 
I find all methods of communication facinating, particularly in my situation. 
And am amazed as to how much "intutition" is involved when face to face with a person - The one thing, alas, that will ever be lacking on the internet. 
(Not disregarding M.O.N.A. the Signing Avatar - but she's pretty scary looking!) It is also interesting (and exasperating) how easily ideas can be misinterpeted regardless if spoken or written - two can write the same idea yet sound opposing simply by their choice of structure and semantics.... Thansk for the insight and input. 
Back to work writing descriptions for D- Links!

The accessibility issues for Web standards and tools: What is a "language?" 
What are the possible means of communication? 
Current standards - such as the HTML LANG attribute - presume textual/legible or verbal/audible communication. 
Sign languages are communicated through visual, spatial and haptic (touch) means. 
As the speed of communications and image/graphics processing increase and prices decrease, visual communication and other mediums become more feasible. 
Literatures of sign languages - recorded speech - can be stored and communicated over the Web. 
Eventually, and soon, real-time sign language communication will become possible. 
Improvements in adaptive technologies also expand the options and responsibilities for authors and user agents (browsers). 
For example, I can think of no technological reason why someone who is both deaf and blind should not be able to use a haptic device, communicating by touch and force-feedback, to browse the Web. 
However, for this to work: - Authors must be able to identify the source language, including sign languages - User agents must recognize and support users' language preferences, including sign languages - User agents must support transcription of the message through enabling technologies. 
Standards must not preclude these possibilities. 
Ideally, they should support and encourage their development. 
P.S.: Agreed, "Mona" is scary-looking!
