Hi, 
Could someone explain why free/open source would have to use different packages. 
This would defeat the portability in Java once the DOM can support full portability(version 3?). 
Thanks, Eric BTW, the explanation of changes / public comments is very nice and appreciated

There are actually two copyright notices for use with W3C specifications; one for documents and the other for software and DTDs/schemas. 
The software notice is at One possibility is to use this, with the proviso that Java bindings not use the org.w3c.* package, and that (as John Cowan proposed) a comment is added that the modified binding does not conform to any W3C standard. 
Would this satisfy the needs of the open source community?

It's just that as written, the Java/JavaScript/IDL code in the DOM is under the W3C document copyright rather than the W3C software copyright. 
The document copyright (rightly) forbids changing anything, but software that contains unchangeable components is not Open Source (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html). 
Making the DOM code available under the software copyright, extended to say "If you modify this you can't use w3c.* packages or claim DOM compliance any more", does the trick.

Lauren Wood and the W3C worked on the copyright, read the new copyright notice in the CR document: 
The open source organization is on the W3C agenda. 
I'll forward the decision in this mailing list.

I have done so. 
Well done, everyone. 
Excellent. Schlingt dreifach einen Kreis vom dies!

Thanks everyone, for all the explanations so that I could understand the issues. 
Eric :-)
