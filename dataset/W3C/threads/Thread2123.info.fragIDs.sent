<s> yep, I caught that one before submitting to IETF (I just edited the PS version, so no need to get a new copy).  </s>
<s> p.8 under implied *LWS: (tspecials) should be Helvetica font  </s>
<s> yep.  </s>
<s> I do hope that the font changes help in reading the text, since they sure are a pain to keep consistent.  </s>

<s> wow, you must be reading it with a magnifying glass.  </s>
<s> ;-) I think I'll just delete "it having a".  </s>
<s> p.42 Sect.  </s>
<s> 8.12 Shouldn't the date format be rfc1123-date, not HTTP-date (which would allow the deprecated asctime-date).  </s>
<s> No. RFC 1123 accepts a much larger set of formats -- the HTTP one is simply a fixed and unambiguous format that is acceptable by RFC 1123.  </s>

<s> 8.12 Shouldn't the date format be rfc1123-date, not HTTP-date (which would allow the deprecated asctime-date).  </s>
<s> I'm confused.  </s>
<s> I wasn't talking about RFC 1123, but about the token rfc1123-date (p.13), which defines a specific date format.  </s>
<s> The token HTTP-date allows one of three different date formats, one of which is rfc1123-date.  </s>
<s> I assumed you wanted to specify just one of those formats.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Ah, sorry, I misunderstood.  </s>
<s> The answer is still no, since all three dates are still valid in HTTP/1.0 messages.  </s>
<s> The requirement that one not be generated is separate from the field syntax.  </s>
<s> I also forgot to include that all three formats are only required to be understood by those applications which parse the contents of the date field.  </s>
