p.1 Expires date has wrong year! 
yep, I caught that one before submitting to IETF (I just edited the PS version, so no need to get a new copy). 
p.8 under implied *LWS: (tspecials) should be Helvetica font 
yep. 
I do hope that the font changes help in reading the text, since they sure are a pain to keep consistent. 
p.17, Sect. 
3.8: ... all tags are not case-sensitive ... - ... all tags are case-insensitive ... 
I'm not sure which is "better" English for a spec. 
MIME uses both. 
p.31 400 Bad Request ... due to it having ... - ... due to its having ... 
wow, you must be reading it with a magnifying glass. 
;-) I think I'll just delete "it having a". 
p.42 Sect. 
8.12 Shouldn't the date format be rfc1123-date, not HTTP-date (which would allow the deprecated asctime-date). 
No. RFC 1123 accepts a much larger set of formats -- the HTTP one is simply a fixed and unambiguous format that is acceptable by RFC 1123. 
p.55 Sect. 
11.2 ... over the net ... - ... over the network ... 
... over the Internet ... 
p.55 Sect. 
11.4 ... nor is there any apriori method ... ... nor is there any a priori method ... -------- ital 
yep. 
p.61 C.1.2 Also need to recalculate Content-Length if line breaks change.

8.12 Shouldn't the date format be rfc1123-date, not HTTP-date (which would allow the deprecated asctime-date). 
I'm confused. 
I wasn't talking about RFC 1123, but about the token rfc1123-date (p.13), which defines a specific date format. 
The token HTTP-date allows one of three different date formats, one of which is rfc1123-date. 
I assumed you wanted to specify just one of those formats.

Ah, sorry, I misunderstood. 
The answer is still no, since all three dates are still valid in HTTP/1.0 messages. 
The requirement that one not be generated is separate from the field syntax. 
I also forgot to include that all three formats are only required to be understood by those applications which parse the contents of the date field.
