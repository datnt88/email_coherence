Using version 3.1 for Windows NT to edit the links view, each time I have mad an edit and then try to use the arrow keys the focus returns to the top of the window. 
It should just stay where it is.

The problem occurs when you're editing an attribute. 
I'll see how to fix it.

The bug is fixed in the CVS base.
