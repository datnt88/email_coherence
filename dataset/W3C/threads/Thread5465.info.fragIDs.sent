<s> This is in response to a request for comments on "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" Working Draft 9 December 2003 http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/ .  </s>
<s> The document could be split into a smaller one which just describes the architecture and a larger one which gives the explanation and justification.  </s>
<s> The language used could be simplified up to make the document shorter and  </s>
<s> easier to understand.  </s>
<s> For example it is not necessary to refer to "this travel scenario" within the example used, as the reader will see that from the context.  </s>
<s> There is no reason to detail more than once that a request will return a "representation of the resource".  </s>
<s> Much of the justification for the architecture in the document is difficult to understand on its own.  </s>
<s> It appears to be a byproduct of an internal W3C debate over where the web should go.  </s>
<s> It would be better if that debate happened outside the standards-type document.  </s>
<s> However, the real test of such a document is how useful it is in practice.  </s>
<s> As an example in 2003 I taught students at the Australian National University how to design iMode web pages http://www.tomw.net.au/2004/wd.html#L1198 .  </s>
<s> In 2004 I was thinking of showing them how to do XHTML-MP web pages.  </s>
<s> Will the "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" help decide if XHTML-MP is a useful technology?  </s>
<s> Will it help in designing better wireless web technology?  </s>

<s> Thanks for the careful review and comments... Sorry for the delay in responding.  </s>
<s> Please stand by for a reply in substance.  </s>
<s> I hope it won't take more than a few more weeks.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003?  </s>
<s> Thank you for your comment: on the TAG's "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" Working Draft 9 December 2003.  </s>
<s> The TAG discussed your comment at a recent meeting and I am answering on behalf of the TAG.  </s>
<s> The TAG has worked hard to find the correct balance on how large the "Architecture of the World Wide Web" WD should be.  </s>
<s> This WD and several previous versions have followed the principle that the document should not be just a point-form architecture specification but that it should contain sufficient motivating examples that the reader has no trouble understanding the rational for the architectural principals in the document.  </s>
<s> The TAG has been very careful to NOT include all the text from its various Findings that are referenced by the WD.  </s>
<s> In fact the TAG has followed the practice of effectively writing a pr?cis of any Finding and then including only that shorter write up in the WD.  </s>
<s> In summary the TAG continues to feel that it has found the correct balance on the material that is in the WD versus that which is in the Findings.  </s>
<s> As such we are not going to change the document as you have requested.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if you are satisfied by this response to the issue that you raised.  </s>

<s> Thanks, I am satisfied that you have given my comment serious consideration.  </s>
<s> But as is I don't see the document as being workable, so I will not be recommending use of the Architecture to my students, colleagues or clients.  </s>
