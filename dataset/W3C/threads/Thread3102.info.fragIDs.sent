<s> Maybe if you have any sort of discussion comments or ideas, post to the list.  </s>
<s> If you have any more concrete ideas or alternative solutions, edit the wiki.  </s>
<s> Or just do both, I don't mind!  </s>

<s> I think the list is a good permanent record of thoughts, issues, changes.  </s>
<s> While the wiki does keep a version history, it isn't quite the same.  </s>
<s> A brief mail message can capture a snapshot of someone's thinking at a given point, which hopefully will also be reflected (eventually) in the wiki view.  </s>
<s> We should btw be very clear that we are making this up as we are going along!  </s>
<s> One of the reasons I was originally excited to do this whole SWAD-E project was as a way of finding out the pros and cons of various ways of collaborating on SW vocab development.  </s>
<s> Whether IRC, wiki, email, Web can be somehow hoooked together to support lightweight collaboration on RDF vocabs, and to use this experience to figure out how/whether/etc other W3C-related efforts might attempt similar things.  </s>
<s> Long way of saying: I don't know what will work, let's find out ;) I would support trying the experiment of subscribing this list to one or more of the thesaurus wiki pages.  </s>
<s> If it gets annoying we can always back off... Interesting idea, let's see how it works out.  </s>
<s> Alistair, others, would that be OK by you?  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Fine by me.  </s>
