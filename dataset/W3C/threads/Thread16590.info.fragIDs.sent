Kynn, Thank you for getting us back on track with this post. 
I realize that mainstream web authors are not about to give up textual images. 
That's fine. 
They don't claim AA conformance -- and so long as they have the requisite ALT tags behind the textual images -- I am not going to make a stink about their site. 
Author aren't going to give up using tables for layout either -- but they don't claim AAA conformance -- so few of us complain about that. 
Kynn, your post below very lucidly highlights the significant accessibiltiy problems with textual images. 
Yet I read your earlier messages on this thread as being something we should not worry about too much. 
Len is not 
saying the WCAG "forbids" textual images (that word is reserved for P1 issues). 
He is arguing that it _is_ a P2 violation, and so should be avoided by those that care. 
I, and others too I'll bet, am still waiting to hear from some of the folks who claim AA (or AAA) compliance, but still employ this technique. 
What is the rational? 
Kynn, what is wrong with acknowledging that the bar for level AA compliance is, in fact, just as high as Len suggests? 
P.S.: One other reason for avoiding textual images (and for using CSS) is that they look terrible in print. 
Is your website useful? 
Then people are 
probably referring to printed hard copies. 
Textual images print at the resolution of the screen (e.g., 72 dpi) and not the resolution of the printer (e.g. 300 dpi). 
Those beautiful 24 bit color anti-aliased menu folder tabs that look so good on the screen often look incredibly amateurish in black and white! 
Cheers, Bruce 
WL: The reason I'm sure that I do need to make the point "forcefully" is that somehow it has been allowed to slip by that images of text are a special case of images. 
They are not. 
Actually, I disagree, there _is_ a special case of textual images (and it's what Len identified when he started this discussion). 
When images are used to represent text, that text is no longer affected by the user's controls over text size/font/color. 
This is also true when images are representing non-textual information as well (such as a picture of my dog). 
In the dog picture scenario, the user has no expectation that her text settings will apply to the size of the image of the dog. 
However, in the textual image scenario, the user has every reason to expect that her text settings _will_ apply to the buttons and headings which were made as graphics. 
Why? 
Because the user is not expected to have to differentiate between "text" and "images as text" -- they appear the same to the end user, they're "words on the screen." 
Len is correct in identifying this as a special case that needs to be dealt with, because it can introduce problems which are unique to textual images -- most obviously, "how can you allow the user to scale up images where the text is too small for her to read?" (There is a similar problem with images which are too small to view -- you may not be able to discern my dog if the picture is tiny -- but there is no user expectation that her "increase font size" button will work.) Textual images obviously do introduce an accessibility hurdle because they break the "change font size" function in the browser, which may be essential for many users with low vision. 
The only question now is "what should be done about that and who should do something about it?" Len proposes that WCAG 1.0 forbids the use of textual images, because HTML+CSS can be used; I maintain that it is not an acceptable solution and that we need to look a little harder. 
There is no obvious, easy solution and it's not simply a case of declaring that "images are images". 
I think on at least some of those message I noted that I was arguing from a devil's advocacy position. 
When the bar is "stop using something useful and instead use something that doesn't work", then the bar is not just "high", it is misplaced entirely. 
That _may_ be appropriate for a priority 3 checkpoint, but as a priority 2 checkpoint it indicates that we (WAI) have to go back and do some work to figure these things out better. 
Unless you are arguing that "double-AA accessibility is an undue burden on web designers?" 
Keep in mind the implication of _that_ is that you're giving various companies and organizations a "free pass" out of having to implement any double-AA considerations, at least under US law as I understand it. 
:) That's what it means if you say "double-AA is hard and _should_ be hard to achieve" -- it means that you are arguing the same as the IBM consultants who testified in the Olympics hearing (and against Jutta). 
I don't believe that the current WCAG checkpoint disallows images-as-text. 
I feel that as written, the requirements ("appropriate markup" to replace images) are not met, as current styled text is not sufficient to replace image text. 
Therefore 
I feel that the bar for double-AA accessibility is at a correct level, and I resist attempts to artificially raise that bar based on the faulty assumption (which I have yet to be held by any graphic artist) that styled text _is_ a replacement for textual images. 
--Kynn PS: 
This is a design issue and not an accessibility issue. 
If a designer is willing to have their graphics look poor when printed, hey, more power to 'em.

[DJW:] My impression from this discussion is that, pending clarification from the author of the document, the requirement is so unclear as to be contractually useless. 
This is a problem with contracts; contractors generally won't accept contracts that require subjective interpretation, as that makes it easy for the purchaser to indefinitely delay acceptance and final payment. 
That's why passing Bobby with no errors is a good test, and A, AA or AAA is a bad test. 
Personally, I consider single A to be a realistic limit for commercial sites with a will for accessibility, but who are not prepared to compromise "the experience" for the primary audience. 
Other problems you will get at AA are compliance with published DTDs, as most commercial sites do not comply## and even those that want to may find it too difficult to eliminate proprietory elements and attributes (the most recent IE DTD seems to be an incorrect one for IE3 - as an example, one cannot have both BGSOUND and LANG++ attributes on the same page and use a published$$ DTD (unless you publish one yourself!). (OBJECT is an unsatisfactory alternative on IE5, as you get lots of ActiveX warnings and a visible media player, and, in the case in question, it broke the formatting on NS 4.5. 
This was on a hobbyist page I was trying to make valid, out of hours.) HTML was not designed to support house styles in documents, in fact the original spec said there was no place for colour. 
It's almost inevitable that one uses lots of non-standard and implementation dependent features to make it work the way the commercial web wants it to work. 
++ I wanted LANG because the page was in both English and German forms, and, in particular, contained English and German proper names. 
However, any HTML 4 feature would have done; personally I would have removed the sound! 
## I really mean cannot comply, as many violate basic SGML rules. 
$$ I'm assuming that the set of DTDs that is used by validator.w3.org represents the published HTML DTDs.
