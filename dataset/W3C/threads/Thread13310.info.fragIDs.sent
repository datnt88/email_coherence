<s> Please notice how the graphical bullets created by FrontPage on index.html  </s>

<s> A modulare table-linearizer etc. as Daniel (or Leonard?) mentioned would fit in very well, one only needs to change the HTMLTable::newTextOnly() method... (see report) Below is some blurb (my opinion) about two questions that seemed to be in  </s>

<s> Talk to you tomorrow on the phone conference, Michael  </s>
<s> 1) Separate/Alternative accessible version: I think realistically this is the way the go, even though in theory it would be nicer to have just one version, with different CSS etc. - but the web and webmasters are just not  </s>
<s> at that point yet.  </s>
<s> -- I must admit that I don't really understand the  </s>
<s> problem people seem to have with an alternative version: Provided that each non-perfectly-accessible page contains LINK title="Text-only version" rel="alternate" href="text_only.html"  </s>
<s> media="aural, braille, tty" to the alternative accessible page, braille UAs and Lynx could just fetch that one instead, transparently for the end-user!  </s>
<s> 2) Interactive vs. automated/batch transforms: I strongly defend fully automated tools for TRANSFORMATION, maybe less so for Evaluation.  </s>
<s> "General public webmasters" don't want to spend time looking at details, but they might be willing to provide an accessible site if it can be done automatically by a tool, with a simple click.  </s>

<s> It's not just "nicer" to have just one version, it's the only method  </s>
<s> that scales for the Web.  </s>
<s> but the web and webmasters are just not at that point yet.  </s>
<s> Our job is to help them reach that point faster.  </s>
<s> You're giving up too soon :-)  </s>
<s> The issue is not the mechanism to find the alternate page, it's the duplication process involved, which leads to - more work for the author (which mean they are likely to drop this part) - likely divergence/out-of-date pages in the alternate site - more complex site management (mess of links from alternate pages going to graphical pages and the other way around) - each new media potentially needs a different alternate version Making a page accessibly also involve more work for the author, of course, but it doesn't carry the other problems and as a bonus, the end-user ends up controling the presentation.  </s>
<s> Text-only links are bad to the extent where they teach people that the only way to make their site accessible is by doubling their number of pages.  </s>
<s> But they are a viable solution for some people, so they are addressed in the PA guidelines.  </s>
<s> If it can be done automatically, why bother the author/webmaster, we just need to integrate the tool in the user agent or in some user proxy.  </s>
<s> Hi Michael,  </s>
<s> The index.html seems accessible to me.  </s>
<s> So why translate it into text-only version.  </s>
<s> To make two versions of a website, graphical and text-only, cost to much time and money on maintanance.  </s>
<s> So I think this is not the way to go.  </s>
<s> Maybe you are right, they are willing to make their website accessible if the only thing they have to do is ONE click, but this doesn't work in  </s>
<s> practice.  </s>
<s> The major problem with accessibility of webpages at this moment is NOT there are graphics, but there are no ALT tags include with these graphics.  </s>
<s> I think a tool that let webmasters interactively enter ALT tags has the highest priority.  </s>
<s> If all graphics on the Internet has a good ALT tag and image map were handled well, I think the Internet is more accessible and there is no need for an alternative text-only version.  </s>

<s> (The Screen Magnifiers Homepage)  </s>
<s> THIS one does, yes, at least kind of.  </s>
<s> Others less.  </s>
<s> If you look at index.html in lynx, you will see [IMAGE] for the bullets etc.  </s>
<s> Other pages, for example using frames, are not at all and a TextOnly (text-equiv) Filter could do something about that and other things.  </s>
<s> Another idea I had recently, is including a link to pdf2txt@adobe.com for PDF links.  </s>
<s> Or a warning before binary links.  </s>
<s> -- Plus, TextOnly (text-equiv) page also loads faster, and displays in EVERY browser, including hand-held small display thingies, not just most recent 4.x.  </s>
<s> That's accessibility as well, isn't it?  </s>
<s> If the tool is fully automatical, it does not cost any time.  </s>
<s> If the tool is completely free, it does not cost any time.  </s>
<s> So I think this is the way to go.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Interesting point, please read next msg to the list where I suggest two study projects.  </s>
