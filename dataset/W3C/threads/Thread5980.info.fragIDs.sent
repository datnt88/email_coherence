<s> However I DO think we need the two parts.  </s>
<s> Here's why ... BUSINESS DON'T JUST USE WEB SERVICES Choreography languages will be used to define how businesses interact with each other so that the definition can be shared with the businesses taking part so that each business can make sure they are following their role in the choreography correctly.  </s>
<s> Depending on the implementation, the ways business carry out their "interactions" will vary.  </s>
<s> For example, one of the interactions might involve "delivery confirmation" by the shipper of goods that were ordered.  </s>
<s> In one implementation this might require a cell phone call from the cycle courier who delivered the goods.  </s>
<s> However, perhaps the contract says that the payment is not made until delivery is confirmed, so "delivery confirmation" is an important part of the overall choreography being followed.  </s>
<s> So, in the middle of this particular implementation of the choreography, there is, in this instance, a non-Web Services interaction, i.e. the phone call.  </s>
<s> However the same choreography, in a different implementation, might be entirely based on web services.  </s>
<s> I think that a CDL that ONLY worked with web services would HAVE to be artificially split in two at this point to handle the cycle courier's cell phone call.  </s>
<s> Whereas for the "all web services" solution it would not be necessary.  </s>
<s> n the other hand if you separate the choreography definition, from the binding of that definition to an implementation, then the problem goes away as you can have multiple implementations of the same choreography using different technologies.  </s>
<s> THE STRUCTURE OF MESSAGES CAN VARY The content of business documents can vary.  </s>
<s> For example RosettaNet, UBL, OAG and hundreds of other ogranizations have all invented their own versions of orders, invoices, delivery notes, etc. Worse than this some of the groups, specifically UBL, have developed fairly simple "core" versions of these documents with the plan for them to be extended to take account of the additional data needs of different industries and countries.  </s>
<s> This means, that, even if everything else (e.g Security, Reliable Messaging) etc is the same, there will be variations in the message content to account for the regional and industry requirements.  </s>
<s> However all these documents will probably exchanged in a fairly limited set of sequences or choreographies.  </s>
<s> If each sequence definition has to be repeated because of changes in the message format, then you will be repeating choreography definitions that are semantically identical and only differ in the detail of the message content.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if you have a separate definition of the sequence, that is defined in a way that is independent of the message format, and then combine that with a binding which shows how the choreography definition works with particular message formats then, again, the problem goes away as the same choreography definition can be used by different industries and regions.  </s>
<s> Like you, I want to reuse whatever specs make sense, but I think that suport for the above two requirements is important and the only "efficient" way I can think of doing this is by having an "abstract" choreography definition language and a "choreography definition binding" that turns the abstract into concrete.  </s>

<s> If you take the three-role choreography described at [1] where the buyer contracts with a shipper to collect and deliver goods from the seller, then you could imagine this being composed out of three lower level choreographies which could exist in their own right, i.e.:a) Order placement: buyer places order with seller and seller confirms; correlation - order nob) Transport booking: Buyer places transport booking with shipper, shipper confirms; correlation - booking refc) Shipment: Shipper collects goods from seller and delivers to buyer, correlation - shipping refSo you could have three different numbers used for correlation.  </s>

<s> FredI think we are basically violently agreeing.  </s>
<s> But let's try and nail this in terms of what we need to define.  </s>
<s> Here's my thoughts.1.  </s>
<s> CHOREOGRAPHY DEFINITION LANGUAGEThis spec will describe how to create a "choreography definition" in a way that is:a) Independent of any message format, i.e. a message is defined in terms of its semantics rather than its structureb) Independent of any service implementation, i.e. the roles that take part in an implementation are defined abstractly (e.g. using WSDL definitions without any bindings)b) Independent of implementation specifics, e.g. how you do corellation, security, reliability etc.c) Composable, i.e. you can build new a choreography out of existing choreographies in a hierachical wayd) Multi-role, i.e. you can involve more than two roles in a choreography, e.g. buyer, seller and shippere) ... some extra things I'm probably missingThe problem with a Choreography Definition Language like this, is that is not directly implementable as it does not relate to any real implementation.  </s>
<s> As it stands it would not be much more than something that is (hopefully) rigorous but can only be used by humans!So what we need is a spec that describes how to use a "choreography definition" defined using the Choreography Definition Language so that it can be used:a) At design time to speed the building of a business process that supports the choreography, andb) At run time to validate that a choreography is being "performed" correctly, i.e. checking that the sequence in which the interactions between the roles occur is in agreement with the rules defined in the choreography definition.So what we need is a ...2.  </s>
<s> CHOREOGRAPHY BINDING SPECIFICATIONThis spec will describe how to bind a "choreography definition" to an implementation.  </s>
<s> This spec will need to specify, or refence specs that specify:a) How to map the message semantics to actual messages including: the payload, the message binding (e.g. SOAP, ebXML, etc), and the use of such things as security and reliabilityb) How to map roles to actual service instances, e.g to map the "seller role" to the a WSDL definition that specifies a concrete bindingc) How to identify the actual choreography definition being used and the instance of the choreography being performed when a choreography is being followedIf we don't specify HOW to do this last point (2c), then we won't get interoperable implementations.  </s>
<s> Note that "how" does not mean we have to write the spec, but if we don't write the spec, we need to specify which spec to follow or we won't have a spec that results in interoperable implementations ... isn't interoperabilitry what standards is all about?  </s>

<s> Keith,I agree with David, but I would also consider the issue to be a matterof separation of concerns.  </s>
<s> The choreography relies on correlationbut it should not define how it is implemented.  </s>
<s> There is another aspect of correlation when a composite choreographyconsistes of a relationship between binary exchanges as for theseller who interacts with the customer and the bank.  </s>
<s> Here thereis correlation between the choreographies, but no message beingpassed, per se.  </s>

<s> I think you have two use cases:1.  </s>
<s> Where there is *no* data inside the "payload" that can be used for corellation purposes, and2.  </s>
<s> Where there *is* data inside the "payload" that can be used for corellationNow, since the first case will sometimes exist, when there is a need for corellation, then you really have no option but to put some type of "choreography instance identifier" in data that is carried with the message, or what, for the purposes of this email, I am calling message "metadata" (Note, for SOAP this would be almost be data in a SOAP header).However if you always insist that the "choreography instance identifier" is present in the message metadata, then, in the second case, there is a risk that the data inside the payload might be inconsistent with choreography instance identifier in the messsage metadata.  </s>
<s> This inconsistency is almost certainly incorret and so there is an error which would should be flagged.You can avoid this inconsistency, if, message metadata, you reference the data in the payload instead with a "choreography instance reference", but at the expense of more complexity in how the correllation is done since it will be impossible, for example to restrict the type of the correlation which could include a combination of different data of different types.  </s>
<s> For example you might need to do correllation based on a combination of "supplier identifier, year and order no".My *personal* $0.02c, would be to always have a "choreography instance identifier" in the data carried with the message, e.g. the SOAP header, as:a) There is always just one way to do correlation at "messaging middleware" level, i.e. in the software layer between the transport protocol software and the applicaitonb) The probability of inconsistency between the messagec) It is *much* simpler!Now, before anyone says anything, I know this is talking about a design, but I think that sometimes thinking about design problems actually helps clarify the problems ... with the proviso that you a) record your design decisions (i.e. in emails like this) and b) you are prepared to revisit the problem in the light of a better understanding of the problems/issues.  </s>

<s> It clearly would be a benefit to the entire industry if we could stick with your requirements 1 &amp; 2, except change 2 to specify exactly which header field MUST contain the choreography instance id.  </s>
<s> Why is it that "you don't want to have to be forced to use an identifier in the header."?

<s> Monica The reason I included requirements 2 and 3 is that they reflect two use cases ... If we assume that there has to be some data in the message that can be used for correlation when the message is taking part in a choreography then requirement 2 arises becaus it is possible that there is no data in the payload (or anywhere else) that can be used for correlation purposes.  </s>
<s> Requirement 3 arises because there maybe data that can be used in the payload and therefore you don't want to have to be forced to use an identifier in the header.  </s>
<s> However, I can also see your point that the existing requirement definitions could be a bit too presrcriptive, so how about these as alternatives, I've added a fourth requirement which hopefully makes it clearer.  </s>
<s> The complete set is as follows ... Requirement 1 (not changed) If a message is being sent between roles as part of the "performance" of a choreography, then that message MUST identify the "choreography instance" to which it belongs.  </s>
<s> Requirement 2 (changed) A choreography instance MUST be identified by specifying a separate identifier associated with the payloads in the message where there is no combination of data in the "payload(s)" that can be used to uniquely identify the choreography instance that is being performed.  </s>
<s> Requirement 3 (changed) A choreography instance MAY be identified by referencing a combination of one or more items of data in the "payload(s)" of the message where that combination of data can be used to uniquely identify the choreography instance that is being performed.  </s>
