What keystroke or menu choice advances to the next item in a list? 
I haven't been able to find this in the help file. 
TIA, Paul Scott 
I just discovered that pressing Enter again seems to do the trick. 
Are there any other answers. 
TIA, Paul Scott 
No you found the right way to add a new item to a list.
