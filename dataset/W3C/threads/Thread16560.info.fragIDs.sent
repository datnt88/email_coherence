<s> Hi! I work for a consulting group which offeres a web usability service.  </s>
<s> Part of our service is of course we check to see if a web site is meeting W3C standards and whether a text-to-speech reader can navigate the site (sadly which i must say always seems to be no).  </s>
<s> I currently have the lab set-up using IBM homepage reader for our text-to-speech test - we also use Bobby, test i.e., netscape, opera, use Lynx, etc.  </s>
<s> Is the IBM product the most representative product for this type of test?  </s>
<s> Is there a product more people use or one that would be a more universal test of what most visually-impaired users rely on?  </s>

<s> I don't think anyone has statistics on this, but a very common scenario for blind people is to use Internet Explorer 5 or 5.5 with Jaws for Windows, Window-Eyes, or another screen reader supporting Microsoft Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> Also, the next version of HPR will be based on IE5 rather than Netscape.  </s>
<s> These screen readers function somewhat like Lynx, in that they capture HTML from the browser, usually decolumnize any tables they find, and in the case of Jaws give you some information about the rows and columns of a table.  </s>
<s> The latest versions of Lynx, by the way, can take a really simple data table and display its rows in a nice way, which I think is an improvement for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> Lynx will not do this new table rendering if a table row cannot fit across the current display width, so it never does a table rendering when tables are being used for layout.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> [sent to Cassandra Thomas; here's a copy for the list, finally... -Al]  </s>
<s> As I understand it, running a screen reader to reproduce the actual interface experienced by a screen reader user is a non-trivial skill.  </s>
<s> It takes some significant investment in learning the tool, and it doesn't always give visual feedback on what the screen reader is doing.  </s>
<s> A significant virtue of HomePage Reader is that it is an easy way to present what is going on with coordinated sight and sound.  </s>
<s> pwWebSpeak is also good in this regard.  </s>
<s> Lynx only gives you the sight, but using it is often enough to grasp the issues underlying a potential screen-reader usability failure.  </s>
<s> What is important about all of these is that they show you the effect within the rapid-fire interactive process of read a little, follow a link, read a little, follow a link, etc.  </s>
<s> It may make more sense to get evaluation services applied to a sample of your pages or questionable issues from people who are customary screen reader drivers, than to try to make competent screen reader drivers out of all the people engaged in evaluation.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there is no magic wand that, by one quick technique, gets to everything you want to catch and explains what was wrong with what was caught.  </s>
<s> Someone in your organization should be systematically comparing your methods against the Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools (AERT) published as a working draft on 22 August 2000.  </s>
<s> Also refer to the change log.  </s>
<s> Start at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/#new to find both of these.  </s>
<s> This will give you a more fine-grained checklist you can run through and ask "in our process, how are we providing an equivalent check?"  </s>
<s> It makes good sense to make Bobby and HPR, for example, the workhorses at the center of your process; but you should understand when other tools might be necessary and how to use them.  </s>
<s> By the way, the Evaluation and Repair group needs feedback from people like you who are doing evaluations in a production environment, to see how practical their suggested methods are.  </s>
<s> What do others think?  </s>
