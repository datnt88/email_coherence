this is an interesting piece of software. 
Not sure it helps much with testing for accessibility. 
What do others think? 
is this worth mentioning in the validation section of the techniues doc as a reference? 
BrowserMaster Use this program to see how your Web page will look at different window sizes, including 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768. 
BrowserMaster takes into account the Windows Taskbar, and you can choose whether it should assume the user places the Taskbar horizontally or vertically on the screen or minimizes it altogether. 
--wendy I don't think this is a good approach. 
The most that this can do is pont up a design that fails one of the most basic rendering tests. 
My experience with multi-browser testing is that it generally gives false-positives for accessibility, so I am much less enamoured of it than I was. 
It seems to me that as a technique it actually requires a fair degree of skill to interpret the results. 
So If we were to specify a minimum set of tests I think we should also point out what these tests do and do not show.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA My problem with BrowserMaster is its consetration on a rather limited set of viewing situations. 
Namly only on computer screens, as well assuming that users are using their full screen space (up to Windows95's task bar). 
The vast majority of designers do take into account these considerations. 
Another program which is in my view is worthwhile mentioning in the Techniques doc is WebTV's simulator. 
Not only that the screen is of low resolution, it also has large fonts, limited scrolling, no way to choose font-family, among other features. 
Although it is limited to simulating a particular browsers, it gives a user familiar only with graphical computer screens more understaning of alternative viewing situations. 
You can get it at http://developer.webtv.net/ 
Another simulator is W3C's Amaya that has a text mode view (that does not attempt to simulate a particular existing browser).
