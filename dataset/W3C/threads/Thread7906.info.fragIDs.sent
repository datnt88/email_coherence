<s> I think this is embodied in a few things we take for granted: - DELETE a resource, and its lock goes away.  </s>
<s> - LOCK a URI that doesn't have a resource, and DAV requires you to create one (a LNR).  </s>
<s> However, there's a statement in the spec that flies in the face of that: "A successful MOVE request on a write locked resource MUST NOT move the write lock with the resource.  </s>
<s> " You could justify that exception by saying yes, in general, locks are tied to resources but do not survive moves.  </s>

<s> What if you MOVE (or rename!) a collection that has locked or lock-null resources inside it?  </s>
<s> If you follow the logic that locks do not survive moves, then you must: - remove all the locks of all the children, including LNRs - remove the LNRs, now that their locks are gone Does any server follow that behaviour?  </s>

<s> The best way to explain the defined MOVE semantics for a LOCK is to say that a LOCK is on a URL, but that it is deleted when the resource mapped to that  </s>
<s> URL is deleted.  </s>
<s> So a MOVE of a collection will delete all locks on URL's for that collection, but that doesn't necessarily remove all locks on the resources in that collection.  </s>
<s> For example, suppose the URL /x/foo.html and /y/bar.html are mapped to the same resource.  </s>
<s> If you LOCK /x/foo.html, and then MOVE /x/foo.html to /z/foo.html, the resource mapped to /z/foo.html is no longer locked.  </s>
<s> If on the other hand,  </s>

<s> On Behalf Of Clemm, Geoff  </s>
<s> So far I can follow; it's not a bad model.  </s>
<s> I'd append "or moved" to the end; most people will consider this different than "deleted" because we have different methods for MOVE and DELETE.  </s>
<s> I don't follow your example as well (reproduced below) because WebDAV doesn't specifically allow for one resource to be mapped by several URLs.  </s>
<s> Let's keep it simple and assume that a WebDAV system only maps URLs to resources 1:1.  </s>
<s> That means that when a collection containing null resources is moved or is renamed, all the locks in the collection disappear, and the null resources must be cleaned up.  </s>
<s> That seems contrary to what the users would like to see happen; that's the scenario that made me rethink the way this works.  </s>

<s> I'd append "or moved" to the end; most people will consider this different than "deleted" because we have different methods for MOVE and DELETE.  </s>
<s> I agree that is worth making explicit to avoid any confusion.  </s>
<s> I don't follow your example as well (reproduced below) because WebDAV doesn't specifically allow for one resource to be mapped by several URLs.  </s>
<s> WebDAV allows for one resource to be mapped to multiple URL's because HTTP specifically allows for one resource to be mapped to multiple URL's.  </s>
<s> In particular, section 9.6 of RFC 2616: "A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs.  </s>
<s> For example, an article might have a URI for identifying "the current version" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular version."  </s>
<s> Therefore the locking protocol (and the rest of WebDAV) must have well defined behavior in those cases where multiple URL's do identify the same resource.  </s>
<s> Let's keep it simple and assume that a WebDAV system only maps URLs to resources 1:1.  </s>
<s> That's fine, but it is good to keep the multiple mapping scenario in mind for when someone suggests a "simpler" model that does not handle the multiple mapping scenario.  </s>
<s> That means that when a collection containing null resources is  </s>
<s> moved or is renamed, all the locks in the collection disappear, and the null resources must be cleaned up.  </s>
<s> That seems contrary to what the users would like to see happen; that's the scenario that made me rethink the way this works.  </s>
<s> The loss of the locks is inherent in a "lock is on the URL" model.  </s>
<s> The reason the "lock is on the URL" model is superior to the "lock is on the resource" model can be seen by looking at the two cases for moving a locked resource.  </s>
<s> - If the client holding the lock does the move, it can easily lock the destination collection with a new depth lock, and then perform the move (the resources will be captured by the new depth lock).  </s>
<s> - If some other client not holding that lock does the move (if it is a shared lock, for example), there often is no good way for for the client to "find" the resource after it has been moved (since all the client has is a URL and a lock token).  </s>
<s> While we were debating this a while back, several vendors objected to the proposal that we require a server to allow a client to easily find a locked resource by using the lock token (PROPFIND Depth:Infinity on "/" is not considered a good way :-).  </s>
<s> Also, note that the current proposal for LOCK'ing an unmapped resource (i.e. creating a real resource there) would leave those empty resources in place to be captured by the depth lock at the destination.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Well, RFC 2518 Ch. 6 says: "The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing access to that resource.  </s>
<s> Using a lock, an authoring client can provide a reasonable guarantuee that another principal will not modify a resource while it is being edited..." This gave me the impression that locks are on a resource and not on one particular URL of that resource.  </s>
<s> I agree that multiple URL and deep locks on collections provide some interesting challenges to define consistent behaviour.  </s>
<s> But I find it a little bit hard to give up the assumption locking resource == locking resource content + properties So, maybe I have misunderstood this thread?  </s>
