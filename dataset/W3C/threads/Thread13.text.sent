I'm new to this list today, so I can not follow up on the previous message by Brad Simpson on May 11 reporting this (bug?). 
The URI output by tidy is The correct URI should probably be At least, there is a DTD for XHTML 1.0 at this URI. 
Documents cleaned and translated into XHTML by tidy fail to pass the validating services at validator.w3.org because of this bad URI. 
It is trivial to correct this in the lexer.c 
file in the tidy distribution though. 
The same goes for the namespace URI, which probably should be My guess is that these URIs changed as of the release of the newest WD of May 5th?

InfoStream AS Yes. 
See Dave Raggett's recent response to this issue in the archives: /Jelks How do I unsubscribe? 
I suggest putting an unsub message in the footer, for future reference! 
Thanks, Mark Wilson Replying to message of Sat, 22 May 1999 16:00:55 +1200 from Mark Wilson mark_tracey@xtra.co.nz regarding ``Re: URI for XHTML DTD output by tidy'' I recommed keeping the message you got when you subscribed, for future reference, rather than making everyone look at an unsubscribe message on each message from the list, taking up space on everyone's drives. 
That message gives all the vitals you need, and it's only a one-time 5.8kb message try 'echo unsubscribe | Mail html-tidy-request@w3.org' TjL That would be great, but I am quite active on the net, so if I kept every little bit of info... welll, you can imagine what happens. 
Eventually I get overwhelmed and then trash the lot. 
If your list uses the "standard" that's great, but I and others am not phsychic and my own XML list for example does not use the "standard" - so you see, placing the "standard" in the sig is nevertheless a good idea. 
Cheers and thanks! 
Mark. 
From the W3C mailing lists page, there is this link: which tells you how to subscribe and unsubscribe to W3C lists.
