<s> I'm most likely missing something here, but in looking over the checklist, I found an item that puzzles me? it is number seven in the forms section which states in paraphrase that elements have keyboard short cuts?  </s>
<s> If I'm using lynx, does this apply?  </s>
<s> and If I'm using annother browser say netscape and ie, how is this passed?  </s>

<s> Gregg, Guidelines are looking good!  </s>
<s> I'd suggest for the ALT text section some examples of images and suggested ALT text.  </s>
<s> That's what we did in the ALT text standards that are now mandatory here for the AT&amp;T corporate site; i.e. the requirements AT&amp;T applies to itself and the design houses that do work for us.  </s>
<s> The standards are publicly available at Another thing we did there was distinguish between mandatory standards and recommended guidelines.  </s>
<s> It's tough to come up with requirements that always apply, but in the interests of having something more readily enforced we made them absolute as possible.  </s>
<s> In particular, ALT text is absolutely required for IMG and AREA except for the following specific exceptions: 1.blank images used as spacers; 2.images which are simply pieces of a larger picture, when one of the other pieces already has ALT text to describe the whole (the pieces may or may not be connected to each other); 3.ornamental images which serve no purpose whatsoever: e.g. they do not highlight or organize, do not convey information or help set a mood, and do not represent anything of interest to anyone.  </s>
<s> As you can see, the first two are unambiguous.  </s>
<s> The third leaves room for judgment, but hopefully the examples in guidelines part will inform that judgment.  </s>
<s> We also require that all text in an image must be in the ALT text.  </s>
<s> Not everyone agrees with this in all cases: for example some other people in these groups have pages with logos that don't follow this.  </s>
<s> However, at least within a context where one wants enforce standards in a simple way, I'd rather err on the side of simplicity, even dogmatism, at least for now Len kasday@att.com phone 732 949 2693 Leonard R.
