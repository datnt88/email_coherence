Hi there, In your DOM specifications' glossaries, you've mention about DOM 0, eg this URL: -0 http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/glossary.html#dt-DOM-Leve l-0 However, why you didn't just call it BOM (Browser Object Model) or NOM (Navigator Object Model) instead of using this slang of DOM-0 ? 
Actually, my request is based on two points: 1) it's confusing because DOM-0 would mislead us to think about Document whereas it's actually Navigator that we're talking about. 
2) as a consortium, your every decision has a very big impact and infuence on others. 
And right now, many people are taking DOM-0 as _standard_ and they would state your glossary as reference, but in fact, you _did_not_ define such a term as DOM-0. 
You just borrowed it (as stated at the beginning of the glossary but visibly few people had noticed that paragraph). 
So I hope that you could do something to rectify this confusion. 
Respectfully yours, SEAK Teng-Fong FuturMaster Tel : +33 (0) 1.46.08.05.96 
The usage of "level 0" to refer to the pre-standardization DHTML APIs has been colloquial usage for years now -- note the date on the document you cite. 
Nobody else has seemed to be offended by the term, or to read it as implying endorsement for any particular product. 
If anyone is really "taking DOM-0 as standard", then they haven't read the DOM Recommendations and changing the DOM's glossary probably isn't going to change their minds. 
I agree that the term is slightly unfortunate, but I don't think changing it at this late date is either necessary or sufficient.
