1 I have read that providing links to original material held on others servers does not infringe copyright . 
This does not seem right, but can anyone point me to a definitive statement? 
ie img src ="http:/www.... 
I would like to implement this but have not done so yet. 2 Where could the WAI recommend that sites which use ASP's and the like either provide accessible sites for non readers, and others, or leave their db's accessible for responsible users? 
The work around involves caching the site and then stripping it, again something I have done, but it is slow. 
3 word counts in meta tags. 
Please could we implement this somewhere? 
I was just writing to a friend about his db searching problems explaining that I had spontaneously abandoned my similiar project, (searching for text free sites) because the results were so thin ~1% and that is the gross and these would need severe weeding. 
You would be amazed at the number of sites with more than 300 words I estimate ~~10% But my vb spider had to stop counting somewhere because looking and counting takes an amazingly long time compared with other more relevant activities.

I've heard some sites say don't do it (it's not linking, but inlining). 
Others are only too keen. 
Best thing is to write to them or see if they have a policy on their web page I suppose. 
NB copyright is a tricky thing on the Internet because it's international. 
For example, there are differences between Britain and America. 
Do you mean word counts in links? 
If you've got the page (and you need the page to have the meta tags), you can run a wordcount anyway. 
I can also just imagine that these things will suffer from "bit rot" - people might put the word counts in but fail to keep them up-to-date. 
my vb spider had to stop counting somewhere You wrote your own web crawler in VB to find text-free sites? 
I'm not surprised it went wrong - the web is *very* big and it's not within the resources of most of us to run a crawler. 
InfoSeek, AltaVista and Lycos tell you the document size (without images) with the search results; this isn't a good indicator but it might help (eg. 
a page that's 100k long will probably contain too much text). 
You could write to AltaVista [1] and ask if they could add a feature that tells you the word count of fetched documents (or indeed search for documents with less than a certain word count [2]) - they seem pretty keen to implement all kinds of things (CJK, translation etc). 
[1] Do it as an organisation not an individual. 
Large companies often pay attention to organisations with important-looking acronyms, but don't pay attention to individuals. 
Writing on paper will probably help too. 
[2] but you'll probably have problems with frames - you might get quite a few hits to frames that just say "Back to home page".... Regards -- Silas S Brown, St John's College Cambridge UK http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/ 
"Anyone inexperienced puts faith in every word, but the shrewd one considers his steps" - Proverbs 13:16 I think you are right to be suspicious of that statement. 
Even if you link to the original site, you are visually incorporating their artwork into your page. 
What's specific about ASP's? 
I believe an ASP can output any type of page, including one with images. 
Does a site have to be pictures only to be accessible to non-readers? 
What if they have access to a program that reads the text on the screen? 
Also, I don't understand what you mean by your workaround. 
What do you mean by stripping the site?
