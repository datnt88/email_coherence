Al asked: Did I hear there is a screen reader already out there that has implemented some sort of skip-navigation heuristic algorithm? 
Window Eyes has skip to next non-active element. 
That often helps, but not when authors put normal "[", "]" and "|" around links! 
To my knowledge that is the only skip navigation technque in the screen reader world. 
Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 That's unfortunate, because I had been going to extra trouble to separate active links with non-active non-blank characters just like that, as a result of an earlier accessibility recommendation :-} While I guess we'll all agree that this business is built on compromise, I'm now wondering whether the optimal compromise may have shifted...? best regards I am note sure, but I think there were dependent agents (screen readers) that didn't separate links lacking normal text between them. 
I don't know of any that have that problem today. 
So if the recommendation to separate links with normal text is still there, it probably should be removed.

Lynx allows the user to move from link to link, whether or not they are separated by anything. 
It also allows the user to view the links, one per line. 
This should enable pretty much anything to cope. 
Explorer and Netscape (on most platforms) allow you to tab through links, again regardless of whether they have separating characters. 
So I would suggest that in the future we should ask for sepaaration of links, since it is important, but that the separation only needs to be clear. 
For example, visually they should be seperated, for example by ckear space. 
At a techniques level, it can be argued that clear space can in fact be a part of the link, so long as there is an obvious part that is a link. 
For example in an image map it may be the case that an image is entirely divided into a dozen links. 
If the image is a series of words, spaced as if a phrase, and which make sense as a phrase, it is not immediately clear how to separate the links. 
This is worse if some of the links are larger than others. 
But if each link has extra space around it they are separated. 
The issue applies to motor and cognitive disabilities. 
Sadly, I don't have any usability data on the seriousness of the effect, which makes it difficult to determine the priority of the requirement.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Hi Charles, Below you argue that the mainline two browsers and lynx each allow you navigate individual links, independent of having normal text between the links. 
Same is true, therefore, for screen readers and its true for HPR and other talking browsers. 
So why do you conclude: quote So I would suggest that in the future we should ask for sepaaration of links, since it is important endquote . 
This discussion may be academic, since when I responded to a Alan's question, I was not aware of the status of the guideline to separate links with normal (non-link) text.

And as I suggest I think it is something that can be easily clarified.
