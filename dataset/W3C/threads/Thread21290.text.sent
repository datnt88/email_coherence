(Taken to www-archive so as not to clutter the list with philosophy.) -- have you ever opened up an HTML page in your browser without a URL? 
Actually yes, I do it all the time with pages I have saved as files and given private file names to. 
Exactly, and those file names created a URL for the document! 
No, they did not conform to the W3C rules for URLs, They don't? 
I don't know of any "W3C rules" for URLs, but they are most certainly in the IETF's URL spec. 
To my knowledge, they are perfectly good URLs. and the files are not accessible on the Web. 
They aren't? 
But I thought you were accessing them! 
You must recognize the definition of Web we are using. 
The Web is the set of all things that have URIs, not the set of things you can type into your web browser and get bits back. 
(They are on a Zip disc in my desk drawer.) 
Not all file names are URLs. 
File names have been used long before anyone thought of URLs. 
I don't see how that's relevant. 
I was around long before they thought of naming me Aaron, but that's still my name, isn't it? 
Obviously you are not a bibliophile. 
What is the URI for my copy of 'Plays Pleasant' by George Bernard Shaw, published by Penguin in 1951, price 1 shilling? 
For the 1815 5th edition of Encyclopedia Brittannica (one volume missing), or the mid-19th century collections of political oratory, or the single precious page from the Nurenberg Chronicles? 
How about the URI for the hand-written diaries and notebooks, and the files of typed correspondence? 
How about the URIs of the stuff written in those diaries and letters? 
Maybe you live in a vision of a future world where all this, and everything else, will be scanned into a kind of global matrix. 
I guess the best thing I can say to that is, over my dead body. 
And for once, I'm not joking. 
I'd certainly agree with you. 
But please understand there is a difference between scanning in the content of something, and simply using a term to refer to it. 
Just giving it a URI would "put it on the Web" so to speak, although this disagrees with common usage. 
And it would never be scanned in to some sort of global matrix. 
I know we've gone over this before so either you just aren't getting this, or you want to stir up trouble. 
Either way, I think this conversation is over.

| weaving the two-way web Fair enough, though y'all need to acknowledge that claims about any kind of naming convention being 'universal' , or anything about 'all documents', IS philosophy. 
If you don't want to start a philosophical argument, don't make philosophical claims (especially highly contentious ones) in front of philosophers. 
-- have you ever opened up an HTML page in your browser without a URL? 
Actually yes, I do it all the time with pages I have saved as files and given private file names to. 
Exactly, and those file names created a URL for the document! 
No, they did not conform to the W3C rules for URLs, I wonder how you are able to know about my file name conventions, but they do not conform to www.imc.org/rfc2017. 
and the files are not accessible on the Web. 
But not through the world wide web. 
I regularly read files while completely disconnected from any kind of Web, eg while flying. 
I have two computers in fact that are not connected to any other computer filing system and have no IP address, so I think that the files on them definitely have no URL. 
You must recognize the definition of Web we are using. 
Maybe it would help if you could tell me what that definition is. 
As far as I can tell (see previous message), the Web in your sense is the entire universe; in fact, since (I am told by our chairman) even imaginary things (unicorns) are resources and so can have URI's , the Web would have to be actually larger than the universe. 
Is that impression correct? 
If so, Tim B-L should be given rather more credit than he is getting, since He apparently invented the entire cosmos. 
The Web is the set of all things that have URIs, not the set of things you can type into your web browser and get bits back. 
Im not sure how to interpret that, since I am not sure how to judge if anything has a URI. 
I know there are many things that do not have names, and many things (most things) do not have URLs. 
Maybe you could enlighten me about this; how can I tell if something has a URI and is therefore Webbified (what does one say? 
On the Web? 
In the Web? 
Part of the Web? 
Referred to by the Web? 
Potentially referred to by the Web?) (They are on a Zip disc in my desk drawer.) 
Not all file names are URLs. 
File names have been used long before anyone thought of URLs. 
Yes, but it isn't your URI. 
My point was that URI's were only invented a while ago; the term is new. 
Names (including file names) have been around much longer. 
If by "URI" you just mean "name", then why not just say "name" ? 
(Why are y'all using this pseudo-technical terminology, if you just mean a plain old idea?) Obviously you are not a bibliophile.

I guess the best thing I can say to that is, over my dead body. 
And for once, I'm not joking. 
Of course I understand that difference. 
But referring to something does not incorporate that thing into the referring sign in any way. 
If a book describes Venice, it would be misleading, to put it mildly, to say that Venice was somehow 'in' the book, or that the book 'contained' Venice. 
It *refers* to Venice. 
If your point is that anything, including a document, might have a URI because anything might be referred to by a URI (much as I might give a name to a speck of dust by simply declaring that I am going to call it 'speck17'), then of course in that sense anything nameable is what might be called web-refer-to-able. 
But to say that anything that is web-refer-to-able *is* on the Web, or *is* included in the Web, seems to me to be simply a misuse of terminology. 
On the face of it, it is obviously wrong, since many things are not in fact referred to at all, on the web or off it, and at any given time far more things are referred to off the web than on it; it ignores the presence of many other sources of reference (all of human spoken language, for a start); and, in the case of documents, it seems to confuse reference with containment, since there is an obvious sense in which an HTML file with a URL *is* 'on the web' in a way that something merely referred to by a document is not on the Web. 
But I thought that your position was that it already has a URI; *everything* has a URI, right? 
(Or did you mean giving it a *new* URI?) would "put it on the Web" so to speak, That is a very bad way to speak, however, since it really doesn't mean what it seems to say. 
Just referring to something doesn't PUT it anywhere. 
At best, it creates a reference, but the referent of most references is quite unaffected by being referred to. 
I don't think you and I have had this conversation before (have we? When?) , though I have had similar discussions with Dan Connolly. 
so either you just aren't getting this, or you want to stir up trouble. 
Either way, I think this conversation is over. 
Indeed, I am not getting it. 
When people say things that seem obviously silly, I tend to assume as a default that I am not getting something. 
I find that the best way to find out what they really mean is often to take what they say at face value and point out how silly it seems to be. 
If pointing out apparent sillinesses is 'stirring up trouble', then I plead guilty; but in fact, I think it actually avoids more trouble than it causes, in the long run. 
However, I do know a fair bit about names, references, meanings and semiotics, so maybe a little further dialog might be mutually useful, if you feel up to it.

I fail to see how this is relevant. 
The relevant RFC seems to be: in which case it doesn't seem to matter what you name your files (we can always escape it). 
You must recognize the definition of Web we are using. 
;-) I'm not sure if you've read TimBL's book, "Weaving the Web", but I recall a quote along the lines of: "At W3C meetings, we have a rule: if it isn't on the Web, it doesn't exist and you can't mention it." 
I agree that we are not at all clear about what it means for something to be "on the Web." 
It seems to have several: - The set of all resources (the domain of discourse, includes things like unicorns) - someplace murky here that I think DanC was referring to with no clear definition - Everything that has a URI scheme meant to identify it (currently files on computers, books with ISBNs, etc.) - Everything available over the Internet. 
- Everything over HTTP I'd also quickly admit that we need better systems for giving things URIs and defining resources. 
I'd like to know if you have any suggestions on how to make this clearer, stemming from your background in semiotics, etc. 
My understanding is that a URI is a special type of name -- one that follows the rules in: It's an attempt to create a naming system that helps prevent name collisions. 
Combined with a resolution system, it seems to have been very useful over the past ten years. 
Of course. 
There is no argument here. 
I continue to agree. 
I suppose it all depends on what the Web means, which I'm no longer sure of. 
Historically, it seems to be: The World Wide Web (known as "WWW', "Web" or "W3") is the universe of network-accessible information, the embodiment of human knowledge. 
- http://www.w3.org/WWW/ $Date: 2001/01/24 18:09:35 $ You seem to be assuming a definition of Web while providing one which makes this long sentence very hard for me to understand. 
However, I agree that the things are very confusing this way and would appreciate suggestions in fixing it. 
I'm not certain that this is true. 
While I may have argued this position, I do not personally believe it strongly. 
I recall having a conversation a month or two bag which talked about grains of sand on the beach, although I'm not inclined to go dig it up. 
Thank you for the offer. 
In this message I've tried to take a different approach -- instead of trying hard to argue the URI "dogma" (and trying to convince you of its truth) instead I hope that my background in the Web and your background in semiotics can help us find some sort of compromise to sort out the difficult bits of the terminology we (the RDF/Semantic Web Community) use. 
I do ask that you bear with me if I say things that are silly, but please continue to point them out. 
I am often an optimist, but I do think we might actually get somewhere on this.
