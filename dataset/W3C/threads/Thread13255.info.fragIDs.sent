Here's a title which is meant to suggest a concept, not actually be the title: "Techniques for automatic implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines". 
It identifies that we're specifically talking accessibility, talking about tools that automatically evaluate/repair, but does not presume either an evaluation or repair orientation.
