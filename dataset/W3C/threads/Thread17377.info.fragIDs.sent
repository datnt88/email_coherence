Dear all 
Quite a wide question but are there any major issues or pitfalls that I need to keep in mind when creating an accessible web site discussion board?

Jerome, You'll find information and pointers to other resources in the "IMS Guidelines for Developing Accessible Learning Applications" which are available at: See especially the sections on sychronous and asynchronous communication and collaboration tools.

The accessifyforum http://www.accessifyforum.com/ 
hit this problem pretty hard on its launch. 
There's a group specifically dedicated just to making the accessifyforum WCAG compliant. 
Here's the relevant link: One particularly incisive comment (and anonymous) very early on that caught my attention is: http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=79
