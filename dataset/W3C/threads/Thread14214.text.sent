"For what it's worth, at the time this conformance schema was discussed, I suggested A, AA and AAA." Daniel's suggestion has couple of advantages. 
It seems very intuitive. 
(This kind of grading or rating system is well-known in North America. 
I don't know how well it would communicate in other parts of the world.) It also recognizes the significance and value of addressing merely the Priority 1 issues by assigning an "A." It would be important to set consistent ways of referring to the levels. 
For example: A-level (or "single-A") accessibility rating AA-level (or "double-A") accessibility rating AAA-level (or "triple-A") accessibility rating It might be helpful to generally attach the word "level," especially for the single-A level, since "A" can refer to other things (Anchor element and the word "A"). 
Perhaps what are now referred to as "conformance levels" should simply be called "accessibility ratings" or, more specifically, "W3C Web content accessibility ratings."

Just want to let you know that I am watching how this plays out with great interest. 
I am envisioning Bobby Approved A, Bobby Approved AA and Bobby Approved AAA. 
Or perhaps Bobby Approved C1, C12 and C123. 
I'm not sure which I prefer but CAST will surely want to align Bobby with the conformance recommendations in a near future release. 
On the other hand, you might consider using Conforms (C1), Conforms Very Well (C12), and Conforms Extremely Well (C123) or something of this sort so that there is a natural language way of describing levels of conformance. 
Can't imagine how we will squeeze all of that onto a Bobby approved icon - but ya never know. 
For some odd reason, I can't imaging standing on stage and actually saying P - 1 - 2 - 3. Chuck Chuck Hitchcock, Director Universal Design Lab (UDL)and Product Development, CAST, Inc., 39 Cross Street, Peabody, MA 01960 Voice 978 531-8555 TTY 978 531-3110 How about "P12. 
P1. P12. 
P12. 
Check check. 
P1. P12. 
P12. 
Check check P12..." Which is what sound engineers say on stage all the time.
