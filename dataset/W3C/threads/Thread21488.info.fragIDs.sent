<s> ".com" was supposed to be for companies, and this site is not a commercial site.  </s>
<s> Ooh, that's a good one!  </s>
<s> Luckily for me RFC 1591 is only informative, not standards-track, so I don't need to meet this requirement.  </s>
<s> The HTML files contain no encoding information  </s>
<s> Did you look at the headers?  </s>
<s> They're sent as:  </s>
<s> purely for stylistic reasons and doesn't seem to add anything to the structore of the document.  </s>
<s> As such, it should be removed.  </s>
<s> I consider span and div as base classes, to be subclassed (using class="...") when no more specific class will do.  </s>
<s> (If we had a decent  </s>
<s> format, we could use namespaces instead.)  </s>
<s> Using well-known-classes for the banner allows tools like screen  </s>
<s> readers to skip over it.  </s>
<s> I think this is important information to provide.  </s>
<s> At least one of those div s is redundant, if not both.  </s>
<s> content indicates the portion of the document that is relatively unique (not part of the banner/head or the footer).  </s>
<s> I can imagine screen  </s>
<s> readers and other tools that might want to jump straight to the  </s>
<s> the sidebar.  </s>
<s> Similarly, I see important structural uses for these.  </s>
<s> A much better alternate text would be [...]  </s>
<s> Added (with some corrections).  </s>
<s> table class="invisible" default background colour h2 class="title" First, why a div ?  </s>
<s> This is a paragraph, not a section.  </s>
<s> Next, the br element.  </s>
<s> the caption [...] should be marked up using a cite element.  </s>
<s> class="calendarhead" Lists that don't use list markup In any case, the copyright notice in the footer should be in a paragraph.  </s>
<s> All fixed.  </s>
<s> The image is purely decorative as far as I can tell: if I was reading this story to someone, the image would not convey any additional information.  </s>
<s> Huh? Did you read the title or the last paragraph?  </s>
<s> In the "What I'm Doing" section  </s>
<s> Removed.  </s>
<s> alt="spread the dot"  </s>
<s> Changed to alt="&amp;#x2022;" - BULLET.  </s>
<s> A bullet is a type of dot, so I think I'm OK.  </s>
<s> According to Dan Conolly, the address element is a general footer element  </s>
<s> It's "Connolly".  </s>
<s> No, that's what I said[1].  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly corrected me,  </s>

<s> I await my fate, Aaron Swartz [http://www.aaronsw.com]  </s>
<s> ".com" was supposed to be for companies, and this site is not a commercial site.  </s>
<s> Yeah.  </s>
<s> Like I said, it's a minor problem.  </s>
<s> In any case the "correct" domain (.name, I guess) wasn't available when you started your site.  </s>
<s> The HTML files contain no encoding information  </s>
<s> I did look at the headers, but apparently not well enough.  </s>
<s> I'm a little confused here.  </s>
<s> I may have been looking at your xhtml.aaronsw.com  </s>
<s> site, which doesn't have a charset header, altough of course it doesn't need one since it unambiguously gets treated as UTF-8.  </s>
<s> My bad.  </s>
<s> purely for stylistic reasons and doesn't seem to add anything to the structore of the document.  </s>
<s> As such, it should be removed.  </s>
<s> This is not what XHTML says, though.  </s>
<s> The DIV and SPAN elements, in conjunction with the id and class attributes, offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents.  </s>
<s> These elements define content to be inline (SPAN) or block-level (DIV) but impose no other presentational idioms on the content.  </s>
<s> They also impose no semantic information.  </s>
<s> Classes and IDs are also free of any defined semantics.  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as a well known class.  </s>
<s> Any tool that makes assumptions about classes is broken.  </s>
<s> To quote from a recent blog of mine:  </s>
<s> Don't use class attributes, unless the XHTML working group define a set of normative classes (which wouldn't be a bad idea, actually).  </s>
<s> A key aspect of class attributes is that they are totally semantic-free: they mean nothing.  </s>
<s> A "rose main" class in a document could mean that the element is the most important aspect of the document as well as being one which has risen above the rest, or it could mean that it is the central part of Rose's speech, or it could mean that it is the part of the document representing the pink hand.  </s>
<s> All that you can assume is that it is a space separated list of author-defined tokens.  </s>
<s> is redundant, if not both.  </s>
<s> Says who?  </s>
<s> It could equally well delimit a span containing the protein content of a recipe.  </s>
<s> Says who?  </s>
<s> It could equally mean the "hand" part of a document.  </s>
<s> Nope, I didn't read the final paragraph (hey, when you're reading a site by its source sometimes you miss stuff... :-) ).  </s>
<s> Ok, so the image does need reasonably alternate text.  </s>
<s> I would suggest: alt="There was an illustration in the Times today, depicting the corner of a building with a single vertically sliding window, open, with two hands having apparently just thrust a two-drawer file cabinet out of the building.  </s>
<s> The file cabinet is upside down and its bottom drawer is open, with papers and files falling out."  </s>
<s> The important thing to note is that the image is conveying the delightful illustration in this case, it is not conveying simply "a file cabinet being thrown out the window".  </s>
<s> Note how now it is definitely a paragraph ( p ) and not a section ( div ).  </s>
<s> Also, be careful where you (don't) put spaces -- currently,  </s>
<s> your first paragraph looks like: "A file cabinet being thrown out the windowJon Keegan, New York Times".  </s>
<s> (Yes, that's "windowJon".)  </s>
<s> The "(left)" part of the paragraph should probably be changed, too, as there is little chance that the image will be on the left unless the UA is a modern graphical Web browser with no user stylesheet (on speech browsers, there is no left).  </s>
<s> As TBL would say, "don't talk  </s>
<s> about the mechanics".  </s>
<s> Possibly a better solution would be to make the text "delightful illustration" link to the image using a fragment identifier.  </s>
<s> alt="spread the dot"  </s>
<s> That seems reasonable.  </s>
<s> According to Dan Conolly, the address element is a general footer element  </s>
<s> Oops, typo.  </s>
<s> Ah, yes, that's the one.  </s>
<s> I don't think signatures usually include copyright notices.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> I think the clearest thing to take from this discussion, by the way, is that XHTML needs to take some ideas from DocBook.  </s>
<s> We need a "subtitle" element, we need a "footer" element, we need a "sidenote" element and a "body" element.  </s>
<s> (Oh wait, we have that.) We need some normative classes.  </s>
<s> Basically, we need more semantics.  </s>
<s> Ian Hickson )\._.,--....,'``.  </s>
<s> fL "meow" /, _.. \ _\ ;`._ ,.  </s>
<s> Not if there's a profile attribute on the head it recognizes.  </s>
<s> is redundant, if not both.  </s>
<s> Says my profile (to be written).  </s>
<s> The alternative text is supposed to convey the same information as the picture, no?  </s>
<s> I don't see how people seeing the picture would be able to tell it was an illustration in the Times.  </s>
