Hi, I used Amaya 0.95 to create my web pages (link in signature). 
Now I have Amaya 1.0, and when I changed the content in one page and stored it, I noticed, that it had removed the border=0 attribute from IMG tags. 
I was not able to add them back using Amaya, I had to resort to vim to correct the pages. 
claudio Claudio Nieder - Kanalweg 1 - CH-8610 Uster - Switzerland I have tried to do the same and I did not notice any problem with the border attribute: if it is in the HTML file, Amaya parses it OK and saves it. 
And you can always add a border attribute to an image by selecting the image (just click on it with the left mouse button) and choosing border from the Attribute menu. 
What version are you running? 
on what platform? 
Could you send me a (short) HTML file that shows the problem? 
Does anyone else noticed that problem?

655 avenue de l'Europe Hi, This is one of my files shortened down to what is needed to show the bug. 
I stored that as t.html. 
I call amaya t.html and in Amaya I just press the Save Icon. 
When I do a cat t.html in another xterm I see: If I select the image and open the attribute menu, I see that the border item "checkbox" is selected. 
The attributes window opened shows me value 0. I change this to say 3, press apply then done, and then press the save button again. 
Then I look at the file again, no border in the img tag. 
I then tried to create a new document, and I just added the image and then added the border attribute wth value 3 and saved the file. 
This is what got saved: No title /title I then tried to add width and height attributes. 
The same problem there. 
I use Amaya 1.0a Beta on an SGI Indy with IRIX 5.3. 
claudio PS: I like it, that you now write out the tags in all lowercase and not uppercase as Amaya 0.95 did! 
Claudio Nieder - Kanalweg 1 - CH-8610 Uster - Switzerland Thanks for your detailed bug report. 
The bug is fixed now. 
We plan to release a new version of Amaya shortly, probably next week. 
You are encouraged to download this new version when it becomes available.
