<s> We have a number of questions about the application of RFC 2978 that  </s>

<s> Hello Mark,  </s>
<s> 'a question' is a very big understatement.  </s>
<s> It was a long list of questions, with additional material outside your mail.  </s>
<s> Also, please be aware of the fact that 'the registrar' is just a secretarial function, they don't have the necessary  </s>
<s> technical knowledge to answer such questions.  </s>
<s> I had a look at the questions, and the outside material, and I think that all your questions make sense, and should be answered by this list.  </s>
<s> But I was just overwhelmed by the number of questions, and had no idea where to start.  </s>
<s> (also, I was on a trip) So I gave up.  </s>
<s> While I think that most of the questions you ask make sense, I think  </s>
<s> you should be aware that the answers may not be straightforward.  </s>
<s> Many of these questions just haven't been considered up to now.  </s>
<s> Also, you should be aware that, at least between updates to the relevant registration documents (RFC), this list (and similar ones) work in some sense similar to (UK or US) case law.  </s>
<s> I.e. if you want an answer to a question, you have to bring a case that exhibits this question (i.e. an actual registration).  </s>
<s> While this is not a hard-and-  </s>
<s> fast condition for discussion on this list, it clearly makes discussion easier.  </s>
<s> Sorry about that.  </s>
<s> I thought this had been dealt with, apparently it hasn't.  </s>
<s> I'll try to have it fixed.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> You're right, I should have written "some questions".  </s>
<s> The situation is that we have some 700ish mapping tables in ICU, and many others in CDRA.  </s>
<s> While we do not need to register all of them,  </s>
<s> there is a substantial number that we will need to register.  </s>
<s> The problem is that many of them differ only to a small degree, in a fashion that may or may not be permitted as a single registration according to the RFC.  </s>
<s> So we need to get some clarity on what the RFC requires before registering any of them.  </s>
<s> A tight definition of a 'charset' would have *every* difference in mappings count, including roundtrips, fallbacks, reverse fallbacks, and extensions.  </s>
<s> A loose definition might only count roundtrip mappings, and allow extensions (e.g. windows-1252 before and after the Euro addition counting as the same registration, even though different results are returned in mapping).  </s>
<s> There would be a very different set of registrations resulting from which definition we should use (or something inbetween).  </s>
<s> Despite your recommendation, I am still rather reluctant to bombard  </s>
<s> the list with all the different possible registrations.  </s>
<s> For everyone's sake, it would really help to get some clarity first!  </s>
<s> That is why we boiled down the questions to very simple examples.  </s>
<s> Each of those examples actually illustrates a known problem, but is *much* easier to comprehend than a multipage mapping table.  </s>
<s> If you think it would facilitate matters, I could put out a separate email for each of the questions.  </s>

<s> Hello Mark,  </s>
<s> I did not want to suggest that.  </s>
<s> I wanted to suggest that you send a very limited number of registrations that each exhibit one of the questions you wanted to ask.  </s>
<s> Sorry if I didn't make myself clear.  </s>
<s> I think that would help focus the discussion, in particular if you have a specific example of a potential registration.  </s>
<s> And maybe not send all the questions at the same time.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
