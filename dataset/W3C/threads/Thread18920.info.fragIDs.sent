<s> In HTML 4.0, application-level event attributes are "onfocus", "onblur" (the opposite of "onfocus"), and "onselect".  </s>
<s> Note that these attributes are designed to be device-independent, but are implemented as keyboard specific events in current browsers.  </s>

<s> There is also the problem that the formal specifications allows the use of onMouseOver MUCH more liberally than onFocus...  </s>

<s> From section 18.2.3 of HTML 4.01 [1]: "The onfocus event occurs when an element receives focus either by the pointing device or by tabbing navigation."  </s>
<s> I don't believe that "tabbing navigation" is required to be accomplished by any particular device such as the keyboard.  </s>
