Hi all! 
First, is there a mailing list/newsgroup devoted to http *questions*, as opposed to protocol issues? 
At the moment, I am trying to understand what does it mean to have multiple language versions of a document, as hinted at in section 7.6 of the draft HTTP document. 
The question (hopefully) directly related to this group is another, however. 
In a distributed environment like WWW it is conceivable that a document is present in many copies scattered throughout the world; for most of these documents it is not mandatory that the copies are *always* verbatim the same, but a slight delay in propagation can be allowed. 
Would it be useful to add a Request Header Field to ask for possible duplicates of the URL, and a corresponding Response Header? 
This way, the client could implement some Internet metric and choose the "nearest" document. 
ciao, .mau. 
Yes, it's www-talk@info.cern.ch 
that section just last week. 
7.6 Content-Language The Content-Language field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. 
Note that this may not be equivalent to all the languages used within the entity. 
Content-Language= "Content-Language" ":" 1#language-tag The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a selective consumer to identify and differentiate resources according to the consumer's own preferred language. 
Thus, if the body content is intended only for a Danish audience, the appropriate field is Content-Language: dk If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the content is intended for all language audiences. 
This may mean that the sender does not consider it to be specific to any natural language, or that the sender does not know for which language it is intended. 
Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. 
For example, a rendition of the "Treaty of Waitangi," presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English versions, would call for Content-Language: mi, en However, just because multiple languages are present within an entity does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences. 
An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as "A First Lesson in Latin," which is clearly intended to be used by an English audience. 
In this case, the Content-Language should only include "en". 
Content-Language may be applied to any media type -- it should not be considered limited to textual documents. 
That would be the same as returning a URC (or URM) in response to a request instead of the document itself. 
Yes, that has been under consideration for a while now, but not directly as part of this WG, and independently of HTTP (though I am one of those working on the issues).

VERY interesting question. 
Caching, replication, and high availability are pretty hot topics, if you ask me. 
HTTP's design isn't optimal for this sort of thing, but HTTP is quickly becoming the proxy-to-everyting protocol, so this functionality needs to be visible through HTTP somehow. 
As query routing and hierarchical caching get deployed, I think it needs to go both ways: the server should be able to give back some variation on the "404 redirected" response that says "4?? redirected to multiple replicas" Also, the client needs to be able to request "GET any of these replicas..." 
I got the idea for GETting replicas from the The Propero Data Access Protocol[1]. 
Have a look at the Harvest[2] project if you're interested in cool resource discovery and high availability techniques.

Topics that aren't the business of any particular working group should probably be addressed to www-talk@info.cern.ch, or to one of the comp.infosystems.www.* newsgroups. 
But you're clearly in the domain of this mailing list when you start here: 
Funny that...I just added a "305 Multiple Choices" to the 1.1 spec last night for the same purpose, but for handling redirection with URC sets. 
The response would be a document, either text/html or urc/*, from which the choice can be selected manually or automatically. 
Possible media subtypes for urc would include urc/http HTTP headers urc/usmarc US-MARC data set urc/iafa IAFA template urc/tei TEI SGML header elements I can think of many possiblities (some good, some bad), but this way the URC can be protocol-independent and we can let the market decide which is the "best" format.
