Hi all 
I've had a nosey in the archives but can't find a definitive answer. 
I know that JAWS and HAL can read in a number of languages but they seem to be Euro-centric. 
Does anyone know if there is support for Asian languages. 
I want to put some pages up in the community languages of our city (Somali, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese and Bengali) and want to put them up as text but I'm wondering whether a screen reader will be able to read the text out in a language that the user can understand.

Hi Julian, Currently, IBM HPR supports the following languages: American English, British English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish. 
JAWs screen reading software supports: American English, British English, Castilian Spanish, Latin American Spanish, French, French Canadian, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Finnish. 
Not sure if there are plans for introducing other language modules to these apps, nor if there are other applications which extend screen reading to other languages (I would think off hand that there would be Russian and Chinese applications at a minimum...)

I believe there are Japanese versions of Jaws &amp; Home Page Reader available in Japan. 
It's difficult to get information in the US (in English) about local versions of screen readers. 
HAL supports nine languages (the usual European suspects). 
The Dolphin speech synthesizers support(ed) 40 languages under DOS. 
Not sure what the current status is. 
Keep in mind the difference between a screen reader that can read text in another language (but with menus, prompts, etc. in its native language), vs. a screen reader written for a particular language.

I believe there is an arabic screen reader available, released about a year ago. 
(Maybe it is only a text to speech engine, but they can be hooked up to various linux-based screen readers and possibly to windows ones as well). 
There's a whole audio-based operating system in brazilian portuguese, there are definitely screen readers able to read "major european languages" (although I have heard finns laughing about the sound of things they use, I have also seen there a system that auto-detected for finnish or english and changed languages on the fly). 
I'd be surprised to find any definitive information on a monolingual list such as this one. 
Any results you do come up with would be useful though, and I suspect interesting to a number of people. 
Certainly there are japanese screenreaders. 
To find out about things like Urdu and Somali you might have to go beyond the subscribers of this list (do you know a Somali who might be interested in researching this a bit?). 
I'll ask around, too. 
But can't hold out many promises.

Charles, While you are looking around, I am also trying to find out what screenreader support there may be for three other languages- Chinese, Vietnamese and Tagalog. 
If anyone on this list knows, please pass it on.

Again not terribly helpful for the original question, but a Google tangent led me to these pages: Compu-Arabica listserv: (Discussing computer access for blind Arabic speakers. 
I'm not sure of the date on this one or if it is still accurate. 
According to a message on one of the Jaws listservs the Arabic screen reader Sakhr is priced at $3000.) UB Access - Hebrew and Arabic Accessibility (Info mainly on Hebrew accessible web markup, but explains difficulties screen readers will have with any language where vowels are inferred from context.) Patrick 
Melingo in Israel has developed a text to speech program called Kolan ambiguity (the omission vowels) and the rich morphology in semantic languages this tool is excellent, claiming 97% correct vocalization. 
Right now it's only in Hebrew but they intend to duplicate this program to Arabic as well. 
Jael
