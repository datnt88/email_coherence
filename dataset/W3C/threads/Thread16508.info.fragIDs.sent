<s> Actually this is a big deal.  </s>
<s> Depending on the punctuation setting you have, the screen reader may not say anything for these punctuation characters.  </s>
<s> If you are using these on links, there's a way to get JAWS to read the title text in some navigation modes.  </s>
<s> If they are on input elements, Window-Eyes will read the title text.  </s>
<s> However with the current state of assistive technology, I believe the solution that's going to give you the widest support from many different products is to either use more descriptive text in the first place, or turn the controls into images and then use the expanded text (next page) as the alt tag.  </s>
<s> " means go back to the first page " means go back to the previous page  </s>
<s> unfortunately, greater than characters in particular are often used to indicate that something is quoted in email.  </s>
<s> A very typical scenario is to turn off the speaking of pronunciation (since it interrupts the flow of reading).  </s>
<s> title is an attribute not an element in HTML (to be pedantic) and many but not all assistive technologies or even good browsers will give access to that, particularly if the attribute is on the a element (the link) rather than on the text itself.  </s>
<s> As a person who does not use a screen reader, I do not find these very recognisable in many contexts - I am used to them in some applications as buttons.  </s>

<s> It can be done in several ways depending on the screen reader of choice.  </s>

<s> If so, there is a way to change the characters on the buttons to text that is read out loud by JAWS when using the tab key for navigation: Look in the _fpclass folder for the file called fbdbrgn1.inc  </s>
<s> If you don't see the _fpclass folder, go to Tools | Web Settings | Advanced | Options - the checkbox for 'Show documents in hidden directories' needs to be checked.  </s>
<s> Here's an example of some changes you can make: fp_sFirstLabel = "First 5 Records " fp_sPrevLabel = "Previous 5 Records " fp_sNextLabel = "Next 5 Records " fp_sLastLabel = "Last 5 Records " fp_sDashLabel = " -- " Here's where it's being used: If you're not referring to FrontPage, hopefully this post may help someone else who is :-) Kathleen Anderson, Webmaster Office of the State Comptroller Hartford, Connecticut 06106 e-mail: kathleen.anderson@po.state.ct.us URL: http://www.osc.state.ct.us/  </s>

<s> Here is an excerpt from one of their emails to me: It looks like using "&amp;#139;", "&amp;#171;", etc. instead of " ", "  " would give us a better screen reading using JAWS.  </s>

<s> These are both illegal in HTML.  </s>
<s> &amp;#127; through &amp;#159; are all illegal.  </s>
<s> They result from poor authoring tools which assume that the reference character set for HTML is Microsoft CP-1252, when it is actually Unicode (or its ISO 8859/1 subset, in earlier versions), with the C1 control set excluded.  </s>
<s> The correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 139 is &amp;#x2039; and the correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 155 is &amp;#x203A;.  </s>
<s> These are SINGLE RIGHT/LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARKs, but I doubt if the screen readers would know this.  </s>
<s> There are proper arrow characters but they are all presentational.  </s>
<s> There's actually another good reason to use some sort of explicit text, although I haven't tested this with the presence of title tags.  </s>
<s> But people using voice input to browse would certainly need text to be able to say the name of the item they wanted to click.  </s>
<s> As I say I haven't tested voice input browsing in a bit so don't know if programs would act on the text in the title tag or not.  </s>
<s> you have to use  rather than trying to put an actual character in for " " (this is only relevant to people who code by hand - tools do this automatically and you don't need to worry).  </s>
<s> The point is that what you provide for the end user should be real text, perhaps associated with a graphic icon.  </s>
<s> Using characters to construct graphics (sometime called ASCII art) is often very difficult for screenreaders and braille readers in particular, and is not recommended in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - see checkpoint 1.1 of the guidelines for details cheers Charles Does it behave the same if you use &amp;gt and &amp;lt vice the actual characters and  ?  </s>
