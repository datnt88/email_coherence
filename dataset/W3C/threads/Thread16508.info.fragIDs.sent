Apologies if this has been covered, but I couldn't find it in the archives. 
Some of our web applications use the following characters as navigation links for large tables (or as button labels, depending on the application). 
I'm sure you're all familiar with them: 
" means go back to the first page " means go back to the previous page 
" " means go to the next page "  " means go to the last page The screen readers we have tested with (IBM Home Page, JAWS) read these characters as "greater than" and "less than" (as they should, since this is what these characters really mean). 
Now this might not be a big deal if vision-impaired users are already accustomed to hearing "greater than" and knowing that it means "go to the previous page". 
Does anyone know if this is the case? 
We put more descriptive information in the title tag, but the screen readers don't seem to read that info at all. 
TIA for any insight you can provide.

Actually this is a big deal. 
Depending on the punctuation setting you have, the screen reader may not say anything for these punctuation characters. 
If you are using these on links, there's a way to get JAWS to read the title text in some navigation modes. 
If they are on input elements, Window-Eyes will read the title text. 
However with the current state of assistive technology, I believe the solution that's going to give you the widest support from many different products is to either use more descriptive text in the first place, or turn the controls into images and then use the expanded text (next page) as the alt tag. 
" means go back to the first page " means go back to the previous page 
unfortunately, greater than characters in particular are often used to indicate that something is quoted in email. 
A very typical scenario is to turn off the speaking of pronunciation (since it interrupts the flow of reading). 
title is an attribute not an element in HTML (to be pedantic) and many but not all assistive technologies or even good browsers will give access to that, particularly if the attribute is on the a element (the link) rather than on the text itself. 
As a person who does not use a screen reader, I do not find these very recognisable in many contexts - I am used to them in some applications as buttons. 
Hope that is helpful.

Does it behave the same if you use &amp;gt and &amp;lt vice the actual characters and  ?

please use functional text here.  
and  mean different things depending on context and if I have my screen reader set to ignore  and 
, I won't even know that they are there.  
for instance is often 
inserted in an email message for each quoted line of a message that is being replied to. 
Lots of us turn this off because it can become quite annoying. 
It is also present in messages that are forwarded and often, that means that for instance if an article that is several thousand lines is forwarded, we hear it repeated with every line so we turn it off. 
When we turn it off, it is usually done across the board. 
It can be done in several ways depending on the screen reader of choice. 
One favorite way is to tell the screen reader that whenever you see  , speak nothing. 
A good rule of thumb when marking up links is to convey in text what the link will do for many reasons.

Martha: It occurs to me after reading the follow up posts to your question that the buttons you are asking about may have been created by the FrontPage 2000 Database Results Wizard. 
If so, there is a way to change the characters on the buttons to text that is read out loud by JAWS when using the tab key for navigation: Look in the _fpclass folder for the file called fbdbrgn1.inc 
If you don't see the _fpclass folder, go to Tools | Web Settings | Advanced | Options - the checkbox for 'Show documents in hidden directories' needs to be checked. 
Here's an example of some changes you can make: fp_sFirstLabel = "First 5 Records " fp_sPrevLabel = "Previous 5 Records " fp_sNextLabel = "Next 5 Records " fp_sLastLabel = "Last 5 Records " fp_sDashLabel = " -- " Here's where it's being used: If you're not referring to FrontPage, hopefully this post may help someone else who is :-) Kathleen Anderson, Webmaster Office of the State Comptroller Hartford, Connecticut 06106 e-mail: kathleen.anderson@po.state.ct.us URL: http://www.osc.state.ct.us/

I believe it does behave the same way. 
Actually, our developers also tested with the numerical characters. 
Here is an excerpt from one of their emails to me: It looks like using "&amp;#139;", "&amp;#171;", etc. instead of " ", "  " would give us a better screen reading using JAWS. 
It reads "&amp;171;" and "&amp;187;" as double left and right bracket respectively. 
However, it does not recognize "&amp;#139;" and "&amp;#155;". 
Does it behave the same if you use &amp;gt and &amp;lt vice the actual characters and  ?

These are both illegal in HTML. 
&amp;#127; through &amp;#159; are all illegal. 
They result from poor authoring tools which assume that the reference character set for HTML is Microsoft CP-1252, when it is actually Unicode (or its ISO 8859/1 subset, in earlier versions), with the C1 control set excluded. 
The correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 139 is &amp;#x2039; and the correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 155 is &amp;#x203A;. 
These are SINGLE RIGHT/LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARKs, but I doubt if the screen readers would know this. 
There are proper arrow characters but they are all presentational. 
There's actually another good reason to use some sort of explicit text, although I haven't tested this with the presence of title tags. 
But people using voice input to browse would certainly need text to be able to say the name of the item they wanted to click. 
As I say I haven't tested voice input browsing in a bit so don't know if programs would act on the text in the title tag or not. 
you have to use  rather than trying to put an actual character in for " " (this is only relevant to people who code by hand - tools do this automatically and you don't need to worry). 
The point is that what you provide for the end user should be real text, perhaps associated with a graphic icon. 
Using characters to construct graphics (sometime called ASCII art) is often very difficult for screenreaders and braille readers in particular, and is not recommended in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - see checkpoint 1.1 of the guidelines for details cheers Charles Does it behave the same if you use &amp;gt and &amp;lt vice the actual characters and  ?
