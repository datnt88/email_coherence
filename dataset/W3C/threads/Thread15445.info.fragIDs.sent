<s> John Regardless of the realtime issue, I don't think you can give a description of a satellite image that conveys all the information of the image.  </s>

<s> This would mean reprogramming the website so they do not open raw JPEG files but use server-side scripting to generate an HTML page.  </s>
<s> It wouldn't require a great effort since they already have to determine server-side what JPG to open based on the selected parameters.  </s>

<s> Naturally enough, by only publishing content that conforms to them :-) Seriously, the real issue for a content aggregator is how to know whether something conforms.  </s>
<s> Here, EARL is designed to help.  </s>
<s> The obvious way is by providing detailed machine-processable conformance statements, so you can make decisions automatically, based on pre-determined criteria (a bit like PICS is used for content selection, but more powerful for this particular problem).  </s>
<s> For example, you may simply publish the information along with references to the EARL, declaring the conformance status for each piece of content rather than the entire content necessarily conforming to a particular level.  </s>
<s> On the positive side, this includes noting that some content far exceeds your usual minimum requirement...  </s>
<s> Or you may decide only to publish stuff that has a minimal conformance profile - and this may or may not be restricted to accessibility.  </s>
<s> (For example, it is easy to rewrite PICS services to RDF, and you might use one tool to then select on several types of criteria, including accessibility).  </s>
<s> Another feature of EARL is that by design it includes information on who made the conformance statement, giving you a base to do quality control on your information, by determining whose statements you trust, mistrust, or distrust.  </s>
<s> Cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> This is an interesting approach for this example.  </s>
<s> But I think I see some problems.  </s>

<s> It is a slippery slope I agree this isn't a sensory experience, I just felt that for purposes of providing a text description, they fell in the same category.  </s>
<s> At the moment, we have only allowed exceptions for art ("when the sole purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific sensory experience"), not for other types of non-text content that is hard to describe into words.  </s>
<s> I think this is too narrow a viewpoint.  </s>
<s> Even without the problems of realtime imaging and aggregate content, satellite images are hard to describe.  </s>
<s> Most descriptions of a satellite image I can think of will not be a real text equivalent, in the meaning that they convey the same information as the original.  </s>
<s> I think we need to reformulate this guideline.  </s>
<s> What we seem to want to say is this: For non-text content, provide text alternatives.  </s>
<s> Whenever possible the text alternative should be equivalent to the non-text content, meaning it serves the same function or conveys the same information as the non-text content.  </s>
<s> If a text equivalent is not possible due to the nature of the non-text content (for example: music and visual art), provide a text label or a description.  </s>
<s> Is this too slippery a definition?  </s>
<s> Personally, I think many people will disagree about the function of certain images so the original definition was slippery anyway (I know several developers who argue that most illustrations have no real function and deserve null alt text).  </s>
<s> What constitutes a good text alternative will be addressed in the gateway techniques so maybe this suggested definition can suffice... Yvette Hoitink Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands E-mail: y.p.hoitink@heritas.nl  </s>

<s> Gregg, I agree that the example we've been discussing-- a real-time feed of satellite photos, in this case of Texas-- aren't really intended to create a "specific sensory experience" as per the wording of 1.1.  </s>
<s> As I noted, the solution Yvette proposed was to treat such content *as if* it fit that description-- she didn't say that it *does* fit the description, and I didn't say that either.  </s>
<s> I also agree that we can't set standards just by presenting examples, and shouldn't have suggested it.  </s>
<s> I also suggested that we might need to add additional language to 1.1 and/or address this type of content under 1.2 (another scary thought).  </s>
<s> To clarify further, I didn't really mean to propose that a "text description" should be provided.  </s>
<s> I was really thinking in terms of a "text label."  </s>
<s> The label might say, for example, "Satellite photo of Harris County, Texas: 2004-05-05 10:23:34 CDT" or something like that-- it would probably include information identifying specific parts of Harris County if the user had requested a more detailed view.  </s>
<s> Providing such a text label is feasible because the necessary information is already available in the data stream-- otherwise it would be impossible to let users specify the parameters of what they want to see.  </s>
<s> So my suggestion was that the script that collects user input and finds the image that matches what the user wants could be modified to (a) write the image to a new HTML page, and (b) write the existing text information to an alt attribute or to the screen (if the text is written to the screen, the script would set alt="").  </s>

<s> Subject: RE: Example: Real-time feed of satellite photos Gregg, I agree that the example we've been discussing-- a real-time feed of satellite photos, in this case of Texas-- aren't really intended to create a "specific sensory experience" as per the wording of 1.1.  </s>
<s> As I noted, the solution Yvette proposed was to treat such content *as if* it fit that description-- she didn't say that it *does* fit the description, and I didn't say that either.  </s>
<s> I also agree that we can't set standards just by presenting examples, and shouldn't have suggested it.  </s>
<s> I also suggested that we might need to add additional language to 1.1 and/or address this type of content under 1.2 (another scary thought).  </s>
<s> To clarify further, I didn't really mean to propose that a "text description" should be provided.  </s>
<s> I was really thinking in terms of a "text label."  </s>
<s> The label might say, for example, "Satellite photo of Harris County, Texas: 2004-05-05 10:23:34 CDT" or something like that-- it would probably include information identifying specific parts of Harris County if the user had requested a more detailed view.  </s>
<s> Providing such a text label is feasible because the necessary information is already available in the data stream-- otherwise it would be impossible to let users specify the parameters of what they want to see.  </s>
<s> So my suggestion was that the script that collects user input and finds the image that matches what the user wants could be modified to (a) write the image to a new HTML page, and (b) write the existing text information to an alt attribute or to the screen (if the text is written to the screen, the script would set alt="").  </s>

<s> Of Gregg Vanderheiden This is an interesting approach for this example.  </s>
<s> But I think I see some problems.  </s>
<s> And we would need to find out how to do this with specification.  </s>
<s> We can't have specification by example.  </s>
<s> I don't think this one actually is a sensory experience.  </s>
<s> It is the presentation of specific information.  </s>
<s> The "big blue marble" picture of the earth may be-but not these.  </s>
<s> They just fall in the category of hard to describe in a reasonable number of words.  </s>
<s> (someone want to poke their head up into live fire and suggest what 'reasonable number of words" would be?) Hence the problem.  </s>
<s> This also doesn't deal with the issue of aggregated content in general.  </s>
<s> But we need to figure out a way to describe this or people could claim that other images are just sensory experiences too.  </s>

<s> Director - Trace R &amp; D Center University of Wisconsin-Madison Of John M Slatin Actually, I think the approach Yvette suggested yesterday would work better than just declaring such pages to be beyond the scope of conformance.  </s>
<s> Yvette suggested that such images-- real-time feeds of satellite imagery-- could be treated *as if* they were content whose purpose is to create a specific sensory experience (i.e., like music or painting): the requirement would be to provide a brief text label or description.  </s>
<s> That text label or description could be built automatically by a script, using the identifying information that accompanies the image in the satellite feed.  </s>
<s> The text label could be coded as an alt attribute, or the alt attribute could be null (alt="") and the identifying text could be written to the screen of an HTML page which would be used to display the image.  </s>
<s> (It would be necessary to place the image on a page in order to provide the text label; this would have the added benefit of allowing a meaningful title element for the page as well).  </s>
<s> We may want to consider adding a phrase about real-time feeds to 1.1, or we may just want to handle this through examples.  </s>
<s> (This one might make a good example because it involves several technologies and their techniques: XHTML and scripting at the very least, with no room for direct human intervention to write alt text, etc.) Or maybe this one really belongs under 1.2? -- On a more theoretical (or at least more abstract) note, isn't there a sense in which most Web content is aggregated content?  </s>
<s> It's been true for years now that Web pages may include content that resides at multiple URIs on multiple machines.  </s>
<s> It's the magic of the rendering agent that makes it all appear to be on the same page.  </s>
<s> (I'm thinking even of very simple pages where text from one file is combined with images in other files on other servers that may be halfway around the world.)  </s>
<s> This has been part of the concept of hypertext from the very beginning: Ted Nelson called it "transclusion" back in the '80s, and I believe there was a similar notion in Engelbart's NLS/Augment system back in the '70s.  </s>
