-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I just want to point out something that would be good in an implementation of a TT format... Something like this should be possible to do on a TT-compatible player: This would be my TT configuration: Translate [_Japanese_] [_data_] to [_English_] [_subtitles_] Display karaoke for [_all_] [_songs_] in [_English_] [_characters_] Display karaoke for [_all_] [_songs_] in [_native_] [_characters_] Other options for the "data" field would be "audio", "images", or "songs" (or any combination). 
Other options for "subtitles" would be "toptitles", "midtitles", or "audio" (tho this last one wouldn't apply to TT, obviously). 
Would a configuration like this be possible with the current TT plans?

I'm afraid I don't follow you. 
What do you mean by "Translate"? 
What do you mean by "data"? 
What do you mean by "_native_"? 
etc.

Basicly, those settings would cause English subtitles to be displayed for all 
Japanese audio, songs, or images. 
In addition, it would enable karaoke for 
all songs in the English/Roman characters and also in their native characters (if Japanese, it would use Japanese characters; if Korean, it would use Korean, etc)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Oh, and a part I forgot... 
It should also be configurable at the level so one can choose whether or not to translate proper nouns (names, places, etc) and to include untranslatable stuff (For example, the Japanese -kun, -san, -chan, - -sama, etc).

I'm afraid I'm still not following you. 
What does translation have to do with timed text?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 That is just an example of what the format would need to support as far as disabling/enabling specific portions of the timed text. 
It's not really translating-specific, but I couldn't think of any other use for timed text.
