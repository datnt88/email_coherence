Dear Editor, May I make a suggestion concerning the page-conformance descriptions, linked to by pages of A, AA, and AAA conformance? 
Readers of a conforming page will see the image link and wonder what it means. 
Yet, in the linked-to page, there is no brief layman's description of, e.g., "conformance level Triple-A of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0." 
You might, for example, have a paragraph along the lines of: "This standard is an attempt to ensure that Web pages are usable by those with disabilities, user-interface restrictions, or who are using unusual browsers. 
Level Triple-A is the most stringent form of the standard." 
One might call this an "informal summary" of the standard's purpose. 
Specification-speak is fine for those who are so inclined (I made my way through the spec for Algol68, after all), but it's neither inviting nor accessible to the casual reader. 
In fact, I would respectfully assert that the conformance specification is (unavoidably) hard for those with limited knowledge of English to understand; hence, pages like http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AAA-Conformance are, themselves, not in compliance with Guideline 14.1, for they refer only to a complex document, offering no brief, easily-understood summary of what conformance means.

Thank you for your suggestions! 
I'm on the road at the moment, but at the first opportunity will review the text in question.

For each of the conformance pages, I added the following miniature description: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 explain how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities. 
Conformance to these Guidelines will help make the Web more accessible to users with disabilities and will benefit all users.
