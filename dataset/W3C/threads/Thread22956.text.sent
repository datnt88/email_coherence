Instructions are at http://www.w3.org/DOM (I'd copy them, but my connection to that server is being flaky at the moment.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research this type is used to extend the current CSSOM. 
valueType contains CSS_CUSTOM when the value is neither a CSS_PRIMITIVE or a CSS_VALUE_LIST or CSS_INHERIT. 
See the SVG spec for an example of an unknown CSS value: Regards, Philippe Philippe Le Hegaret - http://www.w3.org/People/LeHegaret/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DOM Activity Lead
