Ned and myself are happy receiving suggestions on what main topic to have on the agenda (part from the walkthrough of wg's and bof's).

Discussion of application "support" activities, like OPES, might be useful. 
(Useful, that is, if we can refrain from religious overtones.) d/

Hello Patrik. 
I know you typically have a meeting on Thursday for the WG 
chairs. 
Do you know what time that will be yet? 
I will be attending this 
one (finally) and then taking a train out afterwards. 
Since I'm checking train schedules, I thought I would find out what time you thought you might hold the meeting. 
Thanks. 
Dear group. 
I apologize that everyone got a copy of my note to Patrik. 
I thought my email app had left them off (especially since I said reply to sender only).

To the audience: This is about a closed meeting for BOF and WG chairs in the applications area. 
Last year we had a meeting 7-8PM if I remember correctly. 
I don't mind having it earlier, but that will mean that dinner will be delayed. 
I am happy to hear what you think. 
I am happy to have the meeting directly after the sessions end. 
One hour should be enough, and we do have things to talk about this time.
