But neither traversal or action is at the right level of generality. 
[See next message about traversal] Both you and Martin are too focussed, in my view, on browsers and mouse clicks. 
As a possibly useful example, consider the case of external, non-participating 2-ended links to annotate the translation relationship between the sentences of french and english versions of a bilingual document. 
A terminology extraction tool will exploit the semantics of such a link (i.e. behave in a certain way) completely differently to a translation tutorial program. 
Thank you... 
Those of us in the business of being broken records appreciate another voice joining us in... 
I realise this is dragging us back towards the whole link {semantics/type/behaviour} debate, which I have done my best to follow, but it leaves me feeling that although we need to clearly distinguish between 1) intrinsic XML semantics for links, i.e. termini, participation, etc.; 2) XML Application (in the strict SGML sense of 'application') semantics, e.g. the bilingual alignment example above; 3) Implemented application behaviour we are only in the business of specifying (1). 
And we need to specify clearly what is involved in binding 1 - 2 and 3. That is the effort currently called stylesheet that needs a different name, desperately. 
Just for kicks how about using "Display and processing spec" to replace the linking +formatting language I keep referring to as a style sheet?

Agreed. 
Particularly what properties of links are available to rendering and processing (small 'a') applications. 
Jon mentioned history a few days ago -- the thin end of a long wedge. 
How about "rendering and processing spec", although my guess is that processing beyond rendering is too open-ended to be much more than a name for a problem. 
ht Oh yes, a further point that arises in response to David's response: although we need to clearly distinguish between 1) intrinsic XML semantics for links, i.e. termini, participation, etc.; 2) XML Application (in the strict SGML sense of 'application') semantics, e.g. the bilingual alignment example above; 3) Implemented application behaviour we are only in the business of specifying (1). 
David replied: But note that historically by far and away the most common language for defining large-A Applications is NATURAL language---English, German, Japanese, whatever. 
I expect somewhere someone has used, for instance, Z to formally specify an SGML Application, but that's the exception rather than the rule. 
So (2) is really Not Our Problem. 
As for what aspects of (3) ARE our problem, see my reply to Jon on the 'There Are No Metadocuments' thread.
