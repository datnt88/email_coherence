<s> WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and their respective Techniques and only found a mention in the HTML 4.01 spec: and the HTML 4 Accessibility Note.  </s>
<s> "The new "title" attribute gives a short description of an image, etc. Graphical browsers frequently pop-up this information when a user pauses over an element with the mouse (tool-tips), but it is equally useful to non-visual browsers" PJ: neither reference recommends a preference order of TITLE over ALT.  </s>
<s> The UA guideline 2 Ensure that users have access to all content, but not the order.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this should be made explicit in the UA guidelines?  </s>
<s> It may make sense in a visual browser that the title= be render as a tool tip since the user may have access to the visual image.  </s>
<s> But I would recommend a screen reader and text browser to render the alt=text first by default and provide access to the title= some other way.  </s>
<s> After all, in HTML title= attribute is not a WCAG P1 except for FRAME [WCAG 12.1], is a P2 for navigation [WCAG 13.1], and a P3 for ABBR [WCAG 4.2].  </s>
<s> Bruce continued:  </s>
<s> PJ: It is also important to note that the visual image only has the text "MD TAP" on it, so I was confused with the alt="Jump to MD TAP".  </s>

<s> As a general rule of thumb, scripts within the BODY produce content ( document.write() ) or set up event handlers (BODY onLoad="onLoadHandler();").  </s>

<s> Hmm... the dropdown thing "if you're interested in..." looks like a dropdown menu but doesn't seem to be?  </s>
<s> Looks like it needs fixing even _with_ scripts; I find it very confusing.  </s>
<s> A NOSCRIPT would display the whole text instead of the dropdown, I guess.  </s>
<s> (If it's not intended as a menu, why not have plain text, without the need for a script?) The links on the composite image in the middle would need ALT attributes at the least, probably echoing all of the text that is visible with a mousover.  </s>
<s> Without a script they would still function as links (if I understand the code correctly) so a NOSCRIPT is not needed for those.  </s>

<s> Dear Marjolein et al., Thanks for addressing both my question and my problem -- even though the two turned out not to be terribly related!  </s>
<s> Apologies to all about the missing Subject line!  </s>
<s> Getting back to http://www.dohistory.org, from an access point of view, the main problem is the missing ALT content.  </s>
<s> These are the folks who were deliberately removing ALT tags because it distracted from their desired JavaScript mouse-over behavior.  </s>
<s> Is there JavaScript code that suppresses this default "tool-top/pop-up" behavior of IE?  </s>
<s> I was hoping that TITLE="" would do it, but that doesn't sound like it would be the case.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I am continuing to educate (a.k.a. pester) the lead administrator about the importance of ALT text.  </s>
<s> They really are interested in keeping the site accessible (as well they should be, they ARE spending tax payer dollars after all) but, like many we deal with, are not willing to sacrifice their artistic vision.  </s>
<s> Is the DoHistory home page interesting (a.k.a. challenging) enough for someone to accept it for "taking the Kynn challenge"?  </s>
<s> Fixing it is beyond my skills -- I just don't know enough JavaScript.  </s>
<s> Can all the eye candy stay, meet the P1 checkpoints, and satisfy the original site authors?  </s>
<s> I know the last release of Java has some accessibility features built in.  </s>
<s> Please take a look at the kewl-but-totally-inaccessible "Magic Lens" Java applet at URL: The "lens" is the rectangular box that initially appears at the top left of the page image.  </s>
<s> You click-drag it over rest of the page.  </s>
<s> How could this kind of thing be made accessible?  </s>
<s> BTW, the NOSCRIPT question was left over from something I saw on the AdvHtml list the DoHistory situation, but I guess not!  </s>
<s> The question came up as to how to send script-free browsers to a parallel site via something like: HEAD blah, blah, blah Forgiving the WCAG prohibition on automatically redirection, this is not legal HTML syntax either.  </s>
<s> I have no idea how widely supported such code would be, but it doesn't seem like such a terrible approach to me.  </s>

<s> Bruce,  </s>
<s> Ah!  </s>
<s> I should hope not!  </s>
<s> I *use* the tooltips.  </s>
<s> If I came across a page that had ALT attributes and managed to use JavaScript to suppress the tooltips, I'd immediately construct a filter for my trusted Proxomitron (an HTML/JavaScript filter program that functions as a local proxy) to suppress that suppressing JavaScript so no other site could do that to me again.  </s>

<s> I think the phenomenon of authors removing (or not using) ALT because of MS IE ToolTip pop-up behavior may be more widespread than we might care to admit.  </s>
<s> Here's the work around: 1)Use good ALT text tag content (of course)!  </s>
<s> 2)Specify TITLE="" -- this is important -- as part of the same (IMG) element that contains the ALT text.  </s>
<s> The result (with IE 5, I expect 4 also) is suppression of the tool-tip pop-up.  </s>
<s> Visual users get nothing (JavaScript swap-outs excepted) when they pause their mouse pointer over a graphic.  </s>
<s> ALT content IS still accessible to screen reader and text browsers.  </s>
<s> Check out http://www.dors.state.md.us/index2.html as an example (compare to original home page at http://www.dors.state.md.us./index.html -- this demo page will not live for long).  </s>
<s> My problem from before is that I was trying: This works on IE 4.5 on a Mac, but not with Windows.  </s>

<s> Using an empty TITLE attribute in the IMG tag to suppress tooltips does indeed work with MSIE, which suits my wife's client for the moment.  </s>
