<s> Hi I?m trying to send an email containing a url link to a testing usergroup using screen readers.  </s>

<s> links are only useable in email if the function to activate them is available.  </s>
<s> I have not seen outlook express not be able to activate links even as I do have html turned off.  </s>

<s> Are you sending the email as HTML or as text?  </s>
<s> Many programs will convert http addresses in text emails to links.  </s>
<s> Outlook Express does this.  </s>
<s> So if you send: then I can click on or tab to that link even though it's not encoded using HTML.  </s>
<s> Curiously, how did she turn off HTML in Outlook Express?  </s>
<s> I'm sending as text but, because she can only use cursor keys to navigate, it seems she can't "click" but then, I suppose how does she navigate the  </s>

<s> I think her carer turned the html off...  </s>
<s> She cannot tab?  </s>
<s> How did she turn of HTML in Outlook Express, and do you know if it would work on Outlook (the non-Express version)?  </s>
<s> I'd love to get rid of it.  </s>
<s> Is the problem with selecting the URL (I.e. is she unable to use a mouse), does the URL not render as such, or does the URL always fail?  </s>
<s> She can tab, but the url link is just not active and tabbable to, as alink in a web page is.  </s>
<s> If I mouse click on it on her machine, it does work.  </s>
<s> I think it might be her speech browser set up?  </s>
<s> Very likely.  </s>
<s> Normally, you can tab to links in text emails using Outlook Express.  </s>
<s> But I know that speech browsers will often override normal keyboard and cursor functions.  </s>
<s> There must be a way, though.  </s>
<s> what screen reader, version, oe, version is being used here?  </s>
<s> I have never seen a message I cannot tab through as far back as jaws 3.7.  </s>
