Hi, I sent a request to register iso-8859-14 about a year ago. 
What happened with it? 
Kind regards Keld Simonsen And I thought I'd approved it, but can't find the original request at the moment. 
could you resend the registration data?

When did the address for this mailing list change? 
--Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium It hasn't changed in many years. 
Ned It appears to have. 
The recent messages are from ietf-charsets@innosoft.com; earlier ones were to ietf-charsets@iana.org. 
The IANA address is no longer valid, and Majordomo at IANA says no such list for subscription requests. 
--Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium Again, the list has always been ietf-charsets@innosoft.com. 
IANA has in the past maintained a forwarding address that redirects mail to the real list. 
AFAIK IANA has never maintained a charsets list. 
The former should be taken up with IANA; the latter is expected since the list is not and never has been a Majordomo list run by IANA.
