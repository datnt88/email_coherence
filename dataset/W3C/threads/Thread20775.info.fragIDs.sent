<s> Hi I thought I had the same problem but I checked with the Amaya new version I'm using (5.1 for windows) and it works: Open the source window, Resize it to your will, Go in the main window, Special menu and save the current geometry.  </s>
<s> Close the source window or exit amaya and start it again, the source window has now the customized size.  </s>
<s> True, the command "Save current geometry" (see Special/Preferences/Window geometry) saves the geometry of all open views for the current document.  </s>
<s> This command is only available in the main view of the document but it works on all views.  </s>
<s> What is not 'customable' is the size of the font in the source window.  </s>
<s> I always have to 'alt' + '-' several times in order to have a workable source window.  </s>
<s> You can customize the default font size in Special/General/General by changing the value of "Font zoom".  </s>
<s> This applies for the Amaya running on windows only.  </s>
<s> The amaya I use on unix has a suitable font size in the source window (and I just checked the 'Special menu\save geometry' in the main window works as well for source window).  </s>
<s> Shall I send a mail to amaya-dev or whichever list it is?  </s>
<s> This answer is sent to www-amaya@w3.org.  </s>
<s> Thanks Coralie.  </s>

<s> [continuing a private thread with Irene] Using amaya 5.1 on linux, the Special menu of the view source window is always inactive (so I cannot save the current geometry of this window).  </s>
<s> I know at least Max has the same problem.  </s>
<s> Anybody else ?  </s>

<s> What is not 'customable' is the size of the font in the source window.  </s>
<s> I always have to 'alt' + '-' several times in order to have a workable source window.  </s>
<s> '-1' is OK, '-2' makes the font too small.  </s>
<s> '-1.5' would be just fine if it worked...  </s>
<s> I've never loaded fonts with a font-size equal to 10.5pt.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid I don't understand your point.  </s>
<s> Do you mean that the font-zoom I would like to set ('-1.5') is equal to 10.5 pt in font-size, and that it is impossible to get it?  </s>
<s> I'm a bit confused here as 'font-size' is a concept I'm aware of (it is expressed in ponits) whereas 'font-zoom' is a concept I would be tempted to express in percent.  </s>
<s> Of course font-zoom is a percentage.  </s>
<s> As Amaya uses integer values for font sizes we considered that a minimum percentage step of 1% was okay.  </s>
<s> The main problem remains the use of integer values for font sizes, but current APIs used by Amaya on Windows and X-Window platforms require integer values.  </s>
<s> When we'll change to OpenGL we could reconsider this choice.  </s>
<s> Could you confirm that font zoom -1.5 equals font-size 10.5 pt and that it isn't possible to set it?  </s>
<s> The font zoom is an integer value so today you cannot choose a decimal value.  </s>
<s> If the initial font size is 12pt and the font zoom is 1 the loaded font-size will be 11pt.  </s>
<s> If the initial font-size is 12pt and suppose you can give a font zoom 1.5 the loaded font-size would be be 11pt too.  </s>
