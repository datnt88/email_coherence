<s> hello all, The latest version of the guidelines is available for your perusal.  </s>
<s> Note that there have been quite a few changes since the last release (September 18).  </s>
<s> Most of them should be fairly obvious, but for a list see the history of changes at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-wd-changes.html http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wa i-gl-wd-changes.html  </s>
<s> The techniques document has not changed much since the last release.  </s>
<s> There are many links from the guidelines to the techniques document that don't have anchors on the techniques side (so you end up at the top of the document).  </s>
<s> Once we get a feel for the acceptance of this release, we will pound the techniques document into shape and create the content for the anchors.  </s>
<s> We look forward to your comments.  </s>
<s> See y'all on the call tomorrow, --the editors  </s>
<s> Is this the 11 November draft, or is there a later one?  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> it's http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19981117  </s>
<s> Don't be misled by the link text on the referring page which offers you the version from the 11th.  </s>
<s> There is a 17th version at the end of the link.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> whoops!  </s>
<s> The link from the home page has been corrected.  </s>
