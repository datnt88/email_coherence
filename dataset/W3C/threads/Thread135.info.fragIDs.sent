Hi 
Where do i modify tidy so that the program strips everything between Vipul 
Tidy doesn't do that. 
You'll have to do some pre or post-processing yourself. 
It might be nice if Tidy had an option like ... delete-elements: marquee, blink but it opens up a can of worms. 
For example, if you say ... delete-elements: p does it delete the *contents* of all the paragraphs, or just "strip the tags"? 
(In the script example, you wanted the contents removed, but that wouldn't necessarily always be the case). 
And to make it useful, you'd also have to be able to select by attribute ... delete-elements: div[class="foo"], span[class="bar"] You can see that adding this option wouldn't quite be a 15-minute hack. 
:) You can get what you want today by just piping Tidy's output to an XSLT stylesheet, a Perl script, etc. PS. 
A "transform-elements" option would be awful nice too: transform-elements: p[class="foo"]/p[class="bar"], ... Would save writing an awful lot of XSLT stylesheets, scripts, etc. ... /Jelks 
In Perl5 [http://www.cpan.org/ports/], 
$foo =~ s/ SCRIPT[^ ]* .*? \/SCRIPT[^ ]* //gsi; ... would strip all script tags (including content), $foo =~ s/( SCRIPT[^ ]* ).*?( \/SCRIPT[^ ]* )/$1$2/gsi; ... should remove the content of all script tags but leave the tags untouched. 
cheers, sebastian
