<s> Thanks for the suggestions in the meeting last week, and on the list since then, for a new slide in the online overview, describing "What is Web Accessibility." I'd also mentioned that I was going to ask the WAI team for comments on the slides, and Ian pointed out that the slides in the online overview mainly focus on accessibility of Web sites, and that we need to also emphasize the need for accessibility of the software used to access and produce Web content.  </s>
<s> Throwing some of these thoughts together, how about something like the following?  </s>
<s> This could become slide 3, right at the beginning of the slide  </s>
<s> set.  </s>
<s> It needs to be cut down in length.  </s>
<s> Comments welcome.  </s>
<s> What is Web Accessibility?  </s>
<s> Web accessibility includes: - making Web sites accessible to people with disabilities, by making them: -- more perceivable, operable, navigable, understandable and robust -- for people with disabilities that can encounter barriers on the Web. - making software used to access Web sites more accessible to people with disabilities, by making: -- browsers, multimedia players, and other software more usable by people with disabilities, and -- by making this software work better with technologies that some people with disabilities use.  </s>
<s> - making the authoring tools used to produce Web sites -- better support production of accessible Web sites; and -- more usable by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility also: -- benefits many other users of the Web; and -- is a requirement for some Web sites and some Web applications in certain countries.  </s>

<s> Hello Judy and all, I find this slide clear as a whole.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I have problems with the second sub-bullet of the first list.  </s>
<s> If you ignore the first sub-bullet, it sounds as follows: Web accessibility includes: - making Web sites accessible to people with disabilities, by making them: -- for people with disabilities that can encounter barriers on the Web.  </s>
<s> I suggest: Web accessibility includes: - making Web sites accessible to people with disabilities, that can encounter barriers on the Web. -- by making Web sites more perceivable, operable, navigable, understandable and robust.  </s>

<s> For your consideration: Web accessibility: - removing barriers that limit the ability of an individual with a disability or a user of alternative computer access methods to use Web content and Web applications or to participate in their development in a manner one chooses, thereby enhancing ones effectiveness, efficiency and the satisfaction experienced.  </s>
<s> The benefits tend to be more universal facilitating: - the needs of even non-disabled users and developers of websites, and - adherence toorganizational or statutory requirements that might be mandated.  </s>
<s> If this is the first slide,it must define Web accessibility in conceptual terms and relegate words like operable, perceivable, navigable, authoring tools etc to later slides that explain the definition.  </s>
<s> The slides that follow do a splendid job there.  </s>
<s> Also it may be a good idea not to use words like "accessible" (or usable)that are in fact being defined.  </s>
<s> There is no trace of duplication of language and phrases within the above definition nor in relation to the slides that follow.... And it is not very longish!  </s>
