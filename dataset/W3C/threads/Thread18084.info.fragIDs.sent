<s> Section 17.11 of the HTML 4 [1] specification describes accesskey and tabindex.  </s>

<s> Mickey, One of the problems of the W3C HTML 4.0 specification is that it only describes the syntax of how to markup an element to attach an accesskey.  </s>
<s> There is no specification of behavior.  </s>
<s> The only implementation that I know of is for IE 4.0 and IE 5.0.  </s>
<s> Basically it uses the ALT key in combination with the accessksy specified to move the focus to a link or control.  </s>
