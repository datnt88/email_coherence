Its time to revise the charter for the HTTP working group, to bring it into line with the group's planned activities. 
The following reflects my understanding, as HTTP-WG chairman, of our current work commitments. 
To avoid us slipping into bottomless discussions about life, the universe and everything, can you please limit your comments on the charter revisions to things that the group has already discussed. 
The existing (and sadly out of date) charter is at: Now that HTTP 1.0 is done, We are currently focussed on two major areas: HTTP 1.x and HTTPng. 
HTTP 1.x is work on extending the current MIME based protocol, while HTTPng seeks to replace this with a much more efficient protocol, with a smooth transition between the two. 
Current Milestones: o HTTP 1.1 Internet Draft during November 1995 o HTTPng Internet Draft + code and test data for March 1996 Additional milestones are needed for revising the Digest Access Authentication proposal, and for work on HTTP 1.2 (see below). 
The HTTP 1.1 work is limited to: 1) Persistent, stateless connections when client asks and server agrees o Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, valid Content-Length 2) Cache control and a consistent caching algorithm o Cache-Control, URI, better descriptions 3) Preemptive content negotiation o Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Accept-Charset 4) Reactive content negotiation o 300, 406 responses 5) Protocol switch header o Upgrade 6) Methods to support client-server capability negotiation 7) Methods to support user agent authoring and collaboration o PUT, DELETE, LINK, UNLINK, LOCK, GETLOCK, UNLOCK, PATCH 8) A method to support message encapsulation o WRAPPED 9) Digest Authentication - the Digest Access Authentication proposal will be revised for submission as a candidate for an experimental RFC. 
Third party digest authentication will be deferred to future work 10) Proxy improvements o Forwarded, Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization o 407 response, and a new response for "Use Proxy" 11) Defined semantics for metainformation o Title, Link, Base, Content-MD5, Content-Language, etc. 12) Support for resource versioning o Lock, Version, Derived-From, Unless (a general-purpose IMS) HTTP 1.1 is intended as a fast track specification. 
Any features that fail to make the cut for 1.1 will be considered for an HTTP 1.2 specification. 
This is likely to include work on standard mechanisms for extending and upgrading HTTP transactions. 
The HTTPng work is initially limited to: 1) Fixing HTTP's poor performance over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections 2) Providing greater control over delivery of information between clients and servers, including out of order delivery of data and much more efficient content negotiation facilities. 
HTTPng achieves this aim by a compact binary encoding and by encoding of header information into contexts that are preserved across requests, and a design which allows for streaming of requests and responses. 
Out of order delivery and priority control is enabled by using a multiplexing transport, with an initial implementation of the protocol over TCP.

I'd rather not tie MD5 particular *algorithm* to the general 'checksum' *functionality*, (just in case MD6 pops out in few monthes for instance...) {Though I currently use MD5 as the algorithm currently} *** "a la draft" definition: Content-Checksum = "Content-Checksum" ":" 1#(checksum) checksum = checksum-algorithm "=" checksum-value checksum-algorithm = "MD5" | extension-algo (you can define new checksums, like MD4, MD6 (!) unix sum,...) for algorithm MD5 : checksum-value = 32 characters hex ascii coded MD5 checksum for instance for a message content of "this is a test\n" you get : HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows Server: datasrv/dl2.6d99

Using separate header fields for different algorithms is just as applicable (and easier to parse) as any parameterized generic header field.

Why didn't you bring it up on the IETF list or with the IESG? 
Because this is a revision of 1544 which is basically two years old. 
While I think per-protocol headers are the wrong way to do things, it makes sense to me that current practice should be standardized. 
As I said before, the IETF generally doesn't standardize two different ways to do the same thing. 
This is only partially true. 
The IETF has a fairly firm policy of not duplicating work whenever it can be avoided. 
As such, given the existance of a standardized, workable scheme that can already be used to perform this function, it is going to be difficult to obtain approval for another, duplicate mechanism. 
I for one would object to it in my capacity as a member of the applications area directorate. 
The IETF also has a fairly strong history of accepting duplication and letting the market decide. 
If someone can put forward a draft for a header that shows two hash mechanisms, and running code I can't imagine the IETF rejecting it. 
I regard it as axiomatic that the IETF "accepts duplication". 
The networking world duplicates functionality all the time, and as such the IETF has no choice but to accept this practice. 
However, this attitude does not extend to work done within the IETF itself. 
Duplication of work within the IETF is actually quite rare, and when it happens its usually the result of duplication having occurred elsewhere or as a result of work having been done outside the IETF that the IETF isn't entirely comfortable with. 
The acceptance of both ongoing work on Whois++ and on X.500 is a good example of the latter, while acceptance of work on MIME -- X.400 interoperation is a good example of the former. 
You need to examine the record a lot more carefully if you think the IETF actually condones development and standardization of overlapping protocols. 
Look at the SNMPv2 mess, for example -- a possible solution is to have two different security mechanisms available. 
This would break the deadlock and would allow SNMPv2 to progress. 
Yet this alternative is not even being considered -- even when failure may in fact lead to the demise of SNMPv2 completely. 
There is even abundant evidence of this position in the work that's been done on MIME. 
Proposals have been made to also standardize some alternatives to MIME. 
These were rejected out of hand on the basis that they duplicated standards-track work. 
In addition, not many people are aware of the fact that MIME actually supercedes an extant, *standard* protocol -- RFC1049. 
This was in fact a substantive issue at one point, and will require taking action to retire RFC1049 before MIME progresses to standard. 
I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that objections to protocols on the basis of duplication of function are taken very, very seriously, and such objections are going to be made should an attempt be made to standardize some alternative to content-md5 without a clear understanding of how it interacts with content-md5. 
I will object myself in my capacity as a member of the Applications Area Directorate if it comes down to it. 
My position at the present time is that the relative speed issues are more This is what I disagree with. 
I think it is (heck, they) both good enough, and it doesn't matter anyway since most use will be off-line. 
If it doesn't matter then what are your objections to content-md5?
