<s> Hello Alan, What you're looking for is in in the libwww directory: Library/src/HTReqMan.h I suggest you send libwww related questions (everything under that directory or the calls that start with HT...) to the libwww mailing list: www-lib@w3.org  </s>
<s> Could you tell us what kind of tinkering are you doing with Amaya, just for curiosity's sake?  </s>
<s> :) Thanks, -jose  </s>
<s> Hi! THanks for the answer.... it seems odd but somehow or rather, each after i post a question, i'll seem to find the answer after that but i really appreciate you guys answering them:) The purpose why i ask so many libwww questions is simply becoz i'm trying to implement CC/PP Exchange protocol in Amaya.  </s>
<s> Currently, it's the best custom browser available for me to tinker with its request headers.  </s>
<s> Any pointers.  </s>
<s> So far, i havent succeeded yet.  </s>
<s> Seems that after i added the extra CC/PP info into the request header, each time i key in a URL in Amaya and enter, Amaya will just close by itself.  </s>
<s> Guess there's still some bug i havent figured out.  </s>
<s> regards, Alan p.s Thanks again, Jose!  </s>
