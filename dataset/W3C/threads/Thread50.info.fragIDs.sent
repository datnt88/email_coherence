This report is for the Tidy version of 13th January 2000. 
When given a legal HTML 3.2 file, Tidy reports the content to be "HTML proprietary." 
For example, this text, which validates at the W3C site: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN" html head title Valid HTML 3.2 /title /head body /body /html ...is reported as "HTML proprietary". 
The cause is the definition of the HTML 3.2 doctype string at line 60 of lexer.c: 
{"HTML 3.2", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32}, However, the proper doctype string should be: {"HTML 3.2 Final", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32}, ...according to the HTML 3.2 specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC- html32.html. 
This is probably related to my post of 21st January where I posted that valid XHTML 1.0 files are not recognized by Tidy as such. 
Since then I have also found that valid HTML 4.01 are not recognized either. 
All my files validate with the W3C and WDG validators but not with this version of Tidy. 
Older versions of Tidy report HTML versions correctly. 
Maybe there are other errors in that table that you refer to as well? 
Unfortunately I don't have an older version of the source code to check what was there previously.

Thanks for the report. 
I will do some research and ensure that Tidy is better informed for its next release.
