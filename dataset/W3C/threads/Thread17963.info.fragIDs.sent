<s> This could also be done as a javascript - in PERL the action you want to do is s/onmouseover="([^"]+)"/onmouseover="$1" onfocus="$1"/ I used to have a WordBasic script that did something similar.  </s>
<s> Basically yu search for onmouseover=", get to the quotation mark, put everything up to the next quotation mark in a buffer, and then add an onfocus="(whatevris in the buffer)" attribute.  </s>
<s> Or you could work through the DOM - for those who have one, such as IE, that helps interoperability...  </s>
<s> This is based on the fact that there are not pages which use onfocus and onmouseover to do different things.  </s>
<s> Since that would represent a very wierd appraoch to user interface design, I think it is a safe assumption.  </s>
<s> similar process can be applied to onmouseout/onblur, which i think is justified for the same reason.  </s>

<s> AG: Caveat: I haven't read others' responses to this, yet.  </s>
<s> Before I get into specific solutions scenarios, I want to review a few things I think me may know about a solution if there is one.  </s>
<s> There is a concept of severity or weight of consequences that us useful in  </s>
<s> understanding how different events are used.  </s>
<s> The main idea I have at the moment is that OnMouseOver is a light touch, OnHover is a slightly heavier touch, OnClick is a heavier touch yet and OnDoubleClick is the heaviest touch of all these.  </s>
<s> What we really want is the ability to classify the actual consequences of running the even-handler script, and extract severity grading appropriate to the class of change and the current operational profile of user interface couplings.  </s>
<s> But lacking adequate visibility into the transaction associated with a given event, we can guess based on the conventional severity grading of the events used to trigger changes.  </s>
<s> So mapping OnScreenEvent events to some  </s>
<s> other form of screen-free activation method is something of a hack and a guessing game, but it is still worth doing.  </s>
<s> The basic or universal method is the context menu.  </s>
<s> This is familiar as the right mouse button in Microsoft Windows.  </s>
<s> There is also a dedicated Context Menu key in the Windows 95 keyboard.  </s>
<s> In the absense of a viable screen medium of exchange with graphic display and continuously varying pointing, one wants to create an interaction world of abstract, named objects.  </s>
<s> Anything that has an event handler defined for it is an object with methods.  </s>
<s> Anything that has text content has a speak method in the presence of TTS capability (which is regarded as readily available and is a system capability all services delivering information in text form should be prepared to interoperate with).  </s>
<s> The key to the most  </s>
<s> generic method of accessing screen-oriented event handlers is the ability to make any object bearing such a method capable of being the current context in the sense of what is exposed by the current context menu.  </s>
<s> The all event handlers should be action opportunities exposed through this menu.  </s>
<s> In addition, there are quite likely other modes of triggering that are useful in specific scenarios.  </s>
<s> One is the machine to teach reading.  </s>
<s> In that case there is a reading cursor which is moving through the speakable content.  </s>
<s> It is quite likely that the OnMouseOver response should be stimulated when the reading process arrives at the leading edge of the reading stream for an entity with an OnMouseOver response defined.  </s>
<s> This may need to be configurable in terms of whether the OnMouseOver response is simply executed in its native terms, or whether any textual content in a transient display is fed to the speaking process as well, and if spoken is it spoken first or last, or does the reading pause at the end of the prime content for the user to elect to read the annotation or press on.  </s>
<s> That's my buffer contents on how to operate with behaviors that the author conceived of as OnMouseOver responses but in user interface contexts where the screen metaphor is not something that is maintainable as a shared two-dimensional graphic frame of reference shared by application and user.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> aloha, chris!  </s>
<s> this is something that concerns me greatly as well, but more from the perspective of obtaining any information derived from javascripted events that are exposed by on mouseover ... to take an example close to home, consider the main Microsoft home page as i noted in a UA teleconference some time in june or july, the toolbar slash nav bar at the top of the page offers the following options: Home Events/Training Subscribe About Microsoft US/Worldwide Downloads MSN.com all of which are voiced when one navigates the page sequentially using the tab key... however, on mouseover, each of the items in the tool/nav bar spawn a pop-down submenu of options that are not available to me as a speech user -- even if i traverse the nav/tool bar with JFW's mouse emulation cursor, despite the fact that a sighted colleague can see the extended options appear on the screen... the drop-menus that are spawned on mouseover are not automatically voiced, nor can they be considered navigatable as: 1. without sighted assistance, there is no way for a blind user to know that they have been painted to the screen 2. even if one has such foreknowledge, it is difficult to navigate the drop-down menu using speech, as the entire line of text (i.e. everything on the screen, including the text which is partially obscured by the drop-down menu) is read, making it difficult to ascertain what text belongs where -- a difficulty which is exacerbated by the fact that when one queries JFW for font and attribute information, it returns the font and attribute information for the text behind slash beneath the mouseover invoked drop-down menu...  </s>

<s> Frames is a good metaphor.  </s>
<s> Take for example the New Yorker readerlink page http://www.newyorkerreaderlink.com/index2.html .  </s>
<s> Here there is a set of blurbs which occupy the central display space depending on which subtitle arrayed around the main title one has the mouse over.  </s>
<s> Clearly this linearizes to a hierarchical tree structure with a major head, a list of subhead, blurb modules, and then on to the rest of the page.  </s>
<s> But the bodies of the subsections are buried in the scripts.  </s>
<s> This is where the polyglot page-definition medium really bites us.  </s>
<s> The key is that there is a simple information structure, but it takes coordinated changes in display and behavior to map it into the audio environment in a constructive fashion.  </s>
<s> Without scavenging HTML-equivalent content out of the scripts and just managing how they are run, one can still make this structure accessible by making the subtitles readable and attaching to each subtitile a "doOnMouseOver response" action opportunity and trap the mutation event when the page content is changed by running the script.  </s>
<s> Then the user would automatically or on election hear what had changed on the page.  </s>
<s> This would provide a usable if not optimal way to navigate the information contained in the HTML and script, both.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Chris, One way the group has discussed is to make elements that can respond to events (like mouse over) part of the list of active elements that the user can sequentially move to with the TAB key of IE.  </s>
<s> The user could then use a keyboard command to get a list of events an element can respond to and simulate the event by selecting it from the list.  </s>
<s> This should be a user configurable option, due to the potential impact on the number of elements the user would need to navigate (for example if their was an event on the BODY element every element in the document would be associated with that event).  </s>
<s> The number of elements could potentially be more managable if only elements with explicit event handlers were added to the list of active elements.  </s>
