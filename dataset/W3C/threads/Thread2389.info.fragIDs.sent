<s> Is this a different model for 'alternates'?  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> No. It is limited to media types and the syntax isn't even capable of handling media types with quoted parameters (which is why I introduced the braces notation).  </s>
<s> Even if it didn't have those limitations, the overhead of multipart/alternative is an order of magnitude greater than an Alternates with the same expressive power.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> I really meant it the other way around: could the proposed 'Alternates' header be useful for email delivery, or even for a HTTP delivery of multipart/alternatives?  </s>
<s> I think the answer hinges mainly on the use of "absolute URIs" in the 'alternates' draft, which seems (at best) rather awkward when trying to refer to body parts within the same MIME entity.  </s>
<s> But I am not well qualified in this matter.  </s>
<s> The 'cid:' URI is used just for this purpose: to refer to body parts within the same MIME entity.  </s>

<s> I think so.  </s>
<s> Since my first response to this draft, I have thought a little more...  </s>
<s> The main point I would make is that the "types:" proposal (per Lundblade) lists *only* the MIME content-types which are present.  </s>
<s> OTOH, the "alternates:" proposal also allows other negotiable features to be incorporated into the list of options through the extension mechanism.  </s>
<s> Specifically, it reserves "features" for the kind of negotiable feature described in Koen's TCN draft and its progeny.  </s>
<s> Which leads me to the question: Can the 'alternates' proposal be used as a MIME 'multipart/alternate' header in the fashion suggested by Lundblade?  </s>
<s> I think the answer hinges mainly on the use of "absolute URIs" in the 'alternates' draft, which seems (at best) rather awkward when trying to refer to body parts within the same MIME entity.  </s>
<s> But I am not well qualified in this matter.  </s>
<s> (As an aside, for the 'alternates' header it might be worth making an explicit reference to the Freed/Moore RFC 2231 (?) describing multiline MIME headers.  </s>
<s> It seems to be a good match.) GK. Graham Klyne  </s>
