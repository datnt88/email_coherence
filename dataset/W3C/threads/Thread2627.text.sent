Are there plans for http-wg to meet at the next IETF? 
If so, I'd like to request that discussion about draft-nottingham-http-roles-00.txt be considered (I plan to have 01 available before the draft deadline). 
I'm of the opinion that it's most appropriate here, but I'm open to discussing alternate forums. 
Thanks, Mark Nottingham The HTTP working group is expected to close as soon as the last of the existing drafts are moved to RFC. 
While there is value in documenting some implementation concerns for HTTP, your draft is not appropriate for the IETF standards track. 
The reason is because IETF standards specify the protocol, not the means by which servers are implemented to conform to that protocol. 
Phrasing a bunch of implementation concerns as if they were protocol requirements is not appropriate, however well intentioned and useful the document may be. 
....Roy OK. 
I was thinking that it may have qualified as an Applicability Statement, as in section 3.2 of RFC 2026. 
Looking back, I see how that's probably taking too much license with what's there, at least for http-wg. 
In any case, I'm happy if people just start thinking and discussing this stuff, irregardless of the status of the doc. 
If there is another more appropriate place that this sort of thing could live, please tell me. 
Thanks, Mark Nottingham I think that the HTTP working group mailing list is an appropriate forum for discussion of Mark Nottingham's document "Server-Side Roles in the HTTP". 
Even after the working group officially closes, the mailing list remains open for discussion of evolution of the protocol, errata, and progression to 'Standard' status. 
Please note that 'http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com' is preferable to 'http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com'. 
I've seen, for other protocols, an "Implementation Guide" released as an Informational document. 
Larry Only if it isn't talking about issues of compliance and using the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in as described in RFC-2119. 
That is not what an implementation guide does, and I doubt that the IESG would want that in an Informational document. 
I have no objection to discussions on how to best implement HTTP, or further rationale to back up the HTTP requirements. 
What I object to is implementation advice for general-purpose server technology that is made-over to look like protocol requirements. 
The W3C does that sort of thing, but the IETF does not (at least not without clearly distinguishing between informational content and protocol requirements). 
....Roy Quoting "Roy T. Fielding" fielding@kiwi.ICS.UCI.EDU : Roy, I didn't intend to 'make over' the advice to look like protocol requirements, but I freely admit that they can be interpreted that way; I chose to do it that way because it seemed the most natural and clear way to do so. 
My logic was that the requirements set forth in it were only in the scope of the document, so that a product could be referred to as compliant with it, over and above protocol compliance. 
This will hopefully be more clear in a future draft of the document (if there is indeed any point in further revision). 
I apologize if it's not politic to submit this to the IETF, but it seemed the best place to start (as I don't have the cash to join the W3C). 
I am (or at least I was during the writing of this draft) very much an outsider. 
If someone has a suggestion about where this document would best reside (whether that place is in the http-wg or not, as there does seem to be some dissention), I'll be more than happy to talk about it (as I've stated before). 
Mark Nottingham Sorry, that wasn't intended as a criticism of you -- just the current format of your draft. 
If it were actually a protocol spec, I'd be congratulating you on following the proper form and making it easier on the reader. 
What I am worried about is misinterpreting implementation guidance as protocol requirements. 
I think it is a worthwhile document, provided that it emphasizes rationale and not requirements. 
For example, there is very good rationale for having the server constrain the i/o interface to conform to the protocol, and there are many examples you might use to explain the rationale, but the protocol requirements do not change as a result. 
However, phrasing that rationale as "a server MUST do ..." is stating a protocol requirement even if the scope of the document excludes protocol requirements. 
I'm not a W3C member, so I wouldn't encourage that path either. 
What I meant is that W3C does theoretically include implementation conformance among its members as part of its spec writing scope. 
Larry is the one who decides what is or is not appropriate for this forum, and it seems that he wants to discuss the document here regardless of its eventual publication status. 
I agree with his reasons, though again I would prefer that the format be changed so that it won't be misinterpreted.
