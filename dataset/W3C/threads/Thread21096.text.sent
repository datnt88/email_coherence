I have had a regular problem with Amaya 8.0 - perhaps someone can have a look? 
Imagine a page where the markup ends up like this: If I try to hit a carriage return between the H2s, either in source view or the regular view, Amaya crashes. 
I have had other crashes, but this is the one I can most easily repeat.

As We didn't succeed in reproducing the bug, could you send us a sample document and give us some infos about you computer, and the Amaya version you're using ?

Do you have a specific CSS style sheet? 
Could you try to reproduce this bug on another Windows box just to see if it's specific to your environment?
