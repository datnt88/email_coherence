What makes you think that you can just send addresemoval notices to an entire list? 
You need to ubsubscribe by sending an unsubscribe command to the same address that you sent to subscribe to the list. 
Date: June 18, 1998 If you would like to unsubscribe from the w3c-wai-ig@w3.org 
mailing list, send mail to: w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org and put "unsubscribe" in your subject line, rather than sending a message to the mailing list itself. 
You don't need to put anything in the body of the message. 
If you have a question or comment to the list managers, please mail to jbrewer@w3.org or danield@w3.org directly, rather than to the list. 
Thank you, Judy Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org 617-258-9741 Director, Web Accessibility Initiative International Program Office World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE43-355 545 Technology Square, Cambridge MA 02139 USA
