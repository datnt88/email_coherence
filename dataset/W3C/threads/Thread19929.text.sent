I have just tried out the Amaya editor for the first time, primarily to investigate whether we can recommend it to our users for updating their parts of the web site. 
It is the first tool which can be trusted not to rewrite the HTML incorrectly! 
However there is one small glitch, which is manifested with code such as for a table cell: which gets written out after editing the document as: This has added extra blank space following the IMG, which causes the table to render differently in both Netscape and Internet xplorer. 
The effect of this extra space is to misalign the carefully-aligned parts of the table. 
The author of "HTML Tidy" is aware of this problem, which deals with it carefully, but Amaya does not. 
Can anyone suggest a workaround? 
And it would be wonderful if this was fixed in the next release.. 
I know this is on the borderline of the markup/layout and browser-dependent rendering issue, but I don't see any harm in a fix which is entirely an HTML indentation and layout matter.

Parks Road, -- Mervyn King, Deputy Governor, Bank of England Oxford OX1 3PR, UK If you refer to the HTML specification, you will read: SGML (see [ISO8879], section 7.6.1) 
specifies that a line break immediately following a start tag must be ignored, as must a line break immediately before an end tag. 
This applies to all HTML elements without exception. 
The line breaks added by Amaya should not change anything in the way a bowser renders the table. 
IE and NN are wrong. 
Anyway, if this is felt as an annoyance, we can remove these linebreaks in the next release, as the HTML will still be valid.

The closing td, th, and tr's are optional as well according to HTML 4.0, correct? 
So much for standards conformance I guess.
