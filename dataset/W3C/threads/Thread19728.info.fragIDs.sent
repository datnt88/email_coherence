Hi, I just downloaded Amaya to my Windows 95-machine but I'm unable to get it working. 
When I dubble- click, nothing happens! 
I read de readme-files, but they're only talking about UNIX-stuff. 
And in one of the files I saw this strange line: "The first version of this testbed should be available by the end of 1996...". 
Strange program... Bye, Edwin Martin. 
The world is moving so fast these days that the person who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.

We have updated the Windows release (amaya-Windows-1.1a.ZIP) on the W3C server. 
We hope that that version will solve your problem: 
And sorry for the inconvenience. 
Irene. 
Contrary to the new Windows installation instructions, there is no Windows 95 executable provided in the Thot/Win95/bin directory in the distribution. 
The Windows NT executable does execute but with the bugs I reported previously.

On my machine, I have the same problem on 256 colors mode, I'm working on it. 
But if you change the configuration of your display (16 bits true colors/65536 colors), it sould work normally.
