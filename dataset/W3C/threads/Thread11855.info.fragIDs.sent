<s> Plagiarizing heavily from the Web Content guidelines I propose we add the following definition:  </s>
<s> Web Content, Information, Structure and Presentation Web content is content to be viewed by a Web browser and published on the Web or an Intranet.  </s>
<s> Web content consists of the information to be communicated, the structure of the information and the presentation of the information.  </s>
<s> The Web content information refers to the message to be communicated to the reader through natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc.  </s>
<s> The Web content structure refers to how it is organized logically (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of contents, etc.).  </s>
<s> The Web content presentation refers to how it is rendered (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional graphical presentation, as a text-only presentation, as synthesized speech, as Braille, etc.).  </s>

<s> Hi Jutta,  </s>
<s> 1) I am uncomfortable with a definition that begins "Web content is content..." 2) Also, "Web content consists of the information" is followed by "Web content information refers to the message".  </s>
<s> So, by transitivity, is content the message?  </s>
<s> 3) I don't think you need to consider the message of information as part of content.  </s>
<s> I find these definitions a bit unwieldly.  </s>
<s> Can we tweak yours and the WCAG 1.0 definitions as follows: a) Web content is information published on the Web or an Intranet and viewed by a Web browser.  </s>
<s> Authors represent information in a variety of ways on the Web, including through natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc. b) The structure of Web content refers to its logical organization (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of contents, etc.).  </s>
<s> c) The presentation of Web content refers to the way it is output to the user (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional graphical presentation, as an text-only presentation, as synthesized speech, as braille, etc.) - Ian  </s>

<s> Ian, I'm eager to tweak and would appreciate your wordsmithing skills.  </s>
<s> Your proposed revision does not communicate the fact that, in this document, content is comprised of information, structure and presentation.  </s>
<s> If you can add that relational clarification to your revision, I like it.  </s>
