Hello, In the 14 October draft [1], G4 reads: "Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content" I propose changing this to: "Provide ways to check for and correct inaccessible content" A couple of reasons: - I don't like "methods" here. 
Method implies for me some methodology. 
I believe what is meant here is "service" or "tool" or "feature" or something similar. 
I propose "way" since it's a little less specific than "service". 
- I think "check" should be "check for" anyway. 
- None of the other guidelines use gerunds (not important, but still) - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19991014 Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 makes better sense and grammar to me. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins, I like it too. 
Charles makes better sense and grammar to me.
