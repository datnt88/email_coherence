<s> Hello I tried to post annotations to the annotea test server with following two RDF/XML posts, the first one works the second one results in annotation with an invalid body.  </s>
<s> I think the two RDF/XML snippets serializes the identical RDF-graph and thus should cause the same result.  </s>

<s> Hello I investigated a bit further with the problem I described in my mail "protocol question" quoted below (the quote is not exact, it fixes an incorrect termination in the second rdf).  </s>
<s> Annotea does not seem to support "Blank Node Identifier"  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-blank-nodes).  </s>
<s> This can cause annotea to return invalid RDF/XML, e.g. the RDF/XML at  </s>
<s> an "Error: {E201} Syntax error when processing attribute rdf:nodeID.  </s>
<s> In this context, the following attributes are not allowed together: rdf:about, rdf:nodeID[Line = 14, Column = 22]" by the RDF-validator at For compatibility with RDF generated by other RDF-libraries (I'm using jena) support of Blank Node Identifiers would be important.  </s>

<s> Are you suggesting that people not implement the RDF Core specs until they get to REC? :(  </s>
<s> The more implementation feedback we get the better.  </s>
<s> Don't wait til it's a REC before figuring out whether it works for you... Annotea being a "Live Early Adoption and Demonstration" project would suggest early implementation of RDF Core WDs is very appropriate for the project.  </s>

<s> Not suggesting anything, we just have a very limited amount of resources and need to select what we do.  </s>
<s> Something that already is a spec.  </s>
<s> we have less choice than something that isn't.  </s>
<s> But as you know English is my second language and reading between the lines is hard anyway.  </s>
<s> And that's what I was trying to say as we are examining it right now and I did tell that.  </s>
<s> But cannot promise anything until we know a bit more of what is needed.  </s>
