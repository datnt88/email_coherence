The Institute on Independent Living has certain sections of the site translated to Swedish. 
My question: In writing meta-tags; table summaries; image ALT descriptions, etc. do I need to use the ISO-8859 entity for the Swedish characters (i.e. &amp;auml;) or can I just write the character as it appears (? - "a" with an umlaut)? 
Also, where can I get a complete list of LANG attribute codes - without having to pay for a list from ISO? Thanks Kris Walmsley Institute on Independent Living

Interesting one for the guidelines. 
If the character set is clearly specified (I think the best way to do this is to use HTTP-EQUIV) then it 
EM should /EM be fine to use the characters directly. 
When I am at home I use a system which uses 7-bit ASCII, and does not cope with the characters very well. 
This is a legacy problem, and I don't know how widespread it is. 
I know that when I am communicating with Scandinavians (I have an interest in Medieval Scandinavian History), especially Icelanders, I have problems. 
(So do they - hooked-o is not in ISO 8859-1, which is the most common character set I think). 
In general I would come down on the side of using the characters, but this is related to the 'ASCII art' guideline, because there are times when I would suggest using 'quoted-printable' techniques - for example the vietnamese character made of a letter a, with a circumflex or caret character (^) and an acute accent (') is represented in VNI (the common standard in Vietnam itself, although not outside it) as ? 
(A capital E with a circumflex/caret) in ISO 8859-1. 
If I were at home I would get something else again. 
It was common to use a^' or a+^' to represent this character on 7-bti ASCII based systems. 
I don't know if this is a good or bad thing for blind users - one problem may be a lack of appropriate software to map the characters properly. 
This is where the i18n activity seems to cross over the WAI. 
Also, In an ideal world, authoring tools would allow switching between characters and entitiy representations. 
But we don't live in one. 
just some thoughts Charles McCathieNevile 
No, the best way is to use HTTP "charset" parameter in "Content-Type" field. 
See "5.2.2 Specifying the character encoding" in HTML 4.0 Specification [1] for more detail.

then it EM should /EM be fine to use the characters directly. 
Agreed. Masayasu Ishikawa / mimasa@w3.org

What I had in mind is something like the following: 
(which is a cyrillic character set) 
Is this what you meant? 
Charles McCN 
then it EM should /EM be fine to use the characters directly. 
I mean, something like the following in HTTP header, not inside the HTML document. 
HTTP/1.1 spec requires that the character sets other than "ISO-8859-1" or its subsets MUST be labeled with an appropriate charset value.

If I put an HTTP-EQUIV Content-type into a web page then (as I understand it) I don't need to rely on the person who runs the server setting it up to give the correct content-type for all my pages. 
In addition, I produce HTML material to be run from a CD-ROM as files - there is no server to program, so the HTTP-EQUIV is the only mechanism available. 
A related question is how to specify the Language of a document - as I understand it it is possible to use an HTTP-EQUIV to 'fake' a server response, but I can't recall what it is (Content-language: en ???) Does anybody know? 
Charles McCathieNevile 
I wouldn't think that was true. 
The average server defaults to sending files as plain text for any resource it doesn't understand. 
I don't believe that setting an HTTP-EQUIV would work if the file is binary (program/audio/video) and the server sends that as text. 
New MIME types should be easy to add to any server. 
I know that it only takes a couple of minutes on Netscape Enterprise Servers.

Well, kind of. 
They might get double hits for every one of your files. 
(Browser bug or feature? 
Hmmm. 
I can only guess that the browser switches accept languages on the second request. 
I am not really clear on why there is a second request. 
IE does this, I know. 
I am not sure how Nav handles other charsets.) 
Once to read the file and realize the server sent the wrong header, and, the second to retrieve it using the equivalent header. 
Should be no different in effect. 
But, it may cause unwanted problems. 
I feel that having the server send the proper headers is desirable. 
One can give users limited control over the server headers quite easily. 
Busy, lazy, or ignorant sysadmins often just don't bother to properly configure the server, though. 
I would suggest you ask the sysadmin to allow you to use an access (often .htaccess) 
file or similar construct. 
You could then tell the server what content-type to send for those files, among other useful things. 
Also, some servers (Such as Apache) support multilingual webs. 
With this configuration, index.html 
would be the server's default language page (often English), index.html.fr would be the default page for browsers with FR (French) as the primary accept language, index.html.es would be the default for browsers with ES (Spanish) set as the primary accept language, etc. This, of course, depends on proper configuration of the server. 
In effect, a French browser that requests http://someserver/index.html would seamlessly be served http://someserver/index.html.fr with a properly configured server. 
Pages without translations would use the default language version of the page. 
Uh, how would you set an HTTP-EQUIV in a non-html file? 
The default MIME type on most web servers is text/plain. 
However this doesn't effect how the server transfers the file to the client. 
HTTP servers send all streams in binary mode. 
The only difference, to the server, between a text file and image, for example, is the Content-Type header. 
In HTML, you have to use the proper Content-Type to tell the browser how to interpret the binary codes as text when you go above 7-bit US ASCII characters.

In some servers, it might be possible. 
But (as I understand it) most servers don't do so, and as Lynn pointed out, it's not a general solution. 
For example, if the resource is plain text, where to put an HTTP-EQUIV Content-type? 
I have heard (and done) this kind of discussion quite number of times - I know both have advantages and disadvantages. 
That's why XML has introduced encoding declaration. 
But putting the HTTP-EQUIV into your HTML document doesn't mean that you don't have to label your HTTP header correctly. 
To display the document correctly, browsers have to know the character encoding of the document. 
If the proper character encoding information is provided via HTTP header, browsers are able to know how to display the document *before* parsing the document. 
But if the character encoding information is only available via HTTP-EQUIV, browsers have to parse the document to know that information, then try to display the document again. 
That's one of the disadvantages of HTTP-EQUIV. 
Charles: 
In HTTP, you're right, you can use the "Content-Language" header. 
In HTML, you may use the LANG attribute, something like the following: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd" David: 
W3C's Web server is configured to do so. 
For example, try the press release of XSL 1.0 Working Draft [1]. 
Our server will send the document either in English, Dutch, German, Swedish or Japanese, depends on your language request. 
[1] http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/XSL-WD 
In Apache, this language negotiation can be used to label the document correctly. 
The following example shows how to associate the specific charset parameter with the specific language.

I understand this much. 
But, I am not really sure why it must retrieve the document twice from the server. 
I would think that once it parses the EQUIV it could just parse the same file over again. 
The data shouldn't have changed. 
But, that is where I am unsure. 
Maybe the data is changed somehow before it is written to the cache. 
In any case, correct headers are most definitely preferable. 
I have never looked inside a browser. 
I have been inside Apache quite a bit, though. 
The language negotiation is a bit baffling, though. 
It is so simple, yet, so complex.

Oh, I forgot to point out one thing ... 
ISO-8859-7 is "Greek" character set; cyrillic character set is ISO-8859-5.
