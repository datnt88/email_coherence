I've seen in this document : http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt 
some exemples of DAV request and responses. 
But there are still some things I'm not sure about... 
When you see that : What does "multistatus" mean ? 
The line xmlns="DAV:" means that DAV is the default namespace ? 
And since xmlns:R=... defines the URL of the resource, is R:bigbox a live property ? 
Thanx in advance "multistatus" in the DAV: namespace is the top level XML node in the response body to PROPFIND (and various other methods). 
It just groups the "propstat" elements, in case there are more than one resources affected by the request). 
Yes, the xmlns="DAV:" makes "DAV:" the default namespace for the multistatus node and its children. 
And no, the fact that there is a namespace declaration for the it a live property. 
The DeltaV extension to WebDAV defines a "supported-live-property" report, which tells you which properties are live. 
Several of us planning on making sure this report gets "promoted" into the next rev of the WebDAV protocol.

Thanx in advance The URL of the resource is not "http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/" -- that's a namespace for two of the properties. 
Although namespaces can look like URLs, there may or may not be a document at the URL. 
You can think of it as a string of unique characters, no different than "DAV:", even though it looks different. 
The URL of the resource is in fact "http://www.foo.bar/container/". 
The URL of the resource always appears in the href /href tags inside multistatus bodies. 
I think Geoff answered your other questions... Lisa [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On
