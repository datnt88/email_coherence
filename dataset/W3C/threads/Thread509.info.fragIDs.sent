<s> If I run the input at the bottom of this e-mail through Tidy, the ul tag is converted to a div tag.  </s>
<s> I presume this is being done because the ul element does not have any direct li child elements.  </s>
<s> That's probably OK, but the problem we are having is with the following generated div tag: Why are there two style attributes?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the generated div tag only  </s>
<s> have one style tag, with the contents of the ul style tag appended?  </s>
<s> Is this a bug?  </s>

<s> clean.c:BQ2Div(), check before AddAttribute(...) (line 1629) whether the node already has a style attribute.  </s>
<s> If so, insert indent_buf at the very beginning of the attribute value plus ';', otherwise AddAttribute(...).  </s>
<s> This is not a perfect solution, but a reasonable one.  </s>
