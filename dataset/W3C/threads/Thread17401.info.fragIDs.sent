<s> What about opening a help window?  </s>
<s> Is it possible for a browser to detect the use of a screen reader?  </s>
<s> Or other assistive technology?  </s>
<s> If it could, wouldn't it make life easier for designers?  </s>
<s> An alternative text description of such things as help windows (or complex images like maps) could be sent to the screen reader in place of the object.  </s>
<s> Could Javascript be used to open a help window, or, alternatively, send some text to the screen reader if one is detected?  </s>

<s> Have been looking at Atutor today and forwarded information to a friend.  </s>
<s> Not that we are aware of (except maybe HPR).  </s>
<s> We generally avoid using browser detectors, and make sites universal to begin with.  </s>
<s> An AT detector would be nice though.  </s>
<s> greg  </s>
<s> no an AT detector would not be nice, it would stigmatize a person with a disability and open the web site up to a host of legal problems if there was percieved discrimination based on the belief that the visitor was treated differently because of disability, true or not.. I think the concept of AT detector is really a bad road to go down for any reason.  </s>

<s> I'll transform the content so it works better for you.  </s>

<s> nice one, Tomas....agreed.  </s>
<s> Somewhere in this thread I have read things like "It's up to the author" "personal choice" "this is where accessibility is going" and worse "it has yet to be decided" This debate was just as vociferous last time in '99 or whenever and opening a new window was found guilty.  </s>
