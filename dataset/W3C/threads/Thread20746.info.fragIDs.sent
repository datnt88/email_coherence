Hi everybody! 
I have a simple question about the SVG support in Amaya : Is Amaya implementing the Rotate operation from SVG? 
I have some friends that were trying to use ROTATE operation in the TRANSFORM attribute, but they don't succeed.. They even tried some examples from the SVG manual.... May it be a configuration problem? 
Thanks a lot!

In other words, al you have to do to reconfigure Amaya correctly is: 1. Get the source code 2. implement the rotate transformation 3. submit the modifications back 4. recomplile amaya (...well, I admit that might be a bit of work the first time, but it would make a lot of other people happy ;-) cheers chaals Look at my previous answer : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/2001OctDec/0001.html
