Dear Editors, Could You explain to me, what do You want to signify, when You said: ---------[start of cut]---------- "Characters include the Latin letter "A", the Cyrillic letter "I", the Chinese character meaning "water", etc." ---------[end of cut]---------- I would like to know, what words "Cyrillic letter 'I'" mean? 
There are two letters in Russian that can match to this description: the letter "I" or "Simple I"(outline is: "|/|") and the letter "Short I"(it is a letter "Simple I"("|/|") with small dash above it). 
Which of these letters You mention in specification? 
Sincerely yours Aleksey.

The letter referred to is described by a Unicode reference later on: "Here are some examples of numeric character references: ..." * &amp;#1048; (in decimal) represents the Cyrillic capital letter "I". 
So, in effect, you are correct that "Cyrillic letter 'I'" by itself is confusing, but the Unicode reference should tell you exactly which character we're referring to. 
Thank you, Ian
