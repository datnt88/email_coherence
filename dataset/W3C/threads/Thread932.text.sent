Hi, When I use HTML-tidy to clean an html file, all the table s contained in such a file get moved to the end, after the /body tag. 
Example: td col_1 td col_2 p Text br Text Would become something like: p Text br Text td col_1 td col_2 As you see, my layout gets completely messed up like this. 
What am I doing wrong? 
I am using a clean installation of HTML-kit, with the HTML-tidy plugin installed from scratch, with the default options. 
If you wish, I can send you a file that doesn't parse correctly when run through tidy. 
By the way, the "bug tracker" links on the Tidy FAQ page on scourceforge are void: they point to nothing (http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html). 
I'm not subscribed to the html-tidy@w3.org 
mailing list: is this necessary to read the answers to my question? 
I just clicked on the "mailing list" link on the above mentioned page. 
If I need to subscrobe, can someone please tell me how to do so? 
Thanks in advance fior any help, Boudewijn Waijers (bwaijers at tiscali.nl).

I am unable to reproduce this behaivour using current sources. 
If there was such a bug I believe it is fixed now or your test case is incomplete. 
Could you try a more recent version of HTML Tidy? 
Actually, the Tidy output of the above code is: 1 !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 1 html 1 head 1 title /title 1 /head 1 body 1 h1 header /h1 1 1 p Text br 1 Text /p 1 1 table summary="sum" 1 tr 1 td col_1 /td 1 td col_2 /td 1 /tr 1 /table 1 /body 1 /html I noticed that when I add a /tr line, most things work as expected, and the outcome is: 2 !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 2 html 2 head 2 title /title 2 /head 2 body 2 table summary="sum" 2 tr 2 td col_1 /td 2 td col_2 /td 2 /tr 2 /table 2 2 h1 header /h1 2 2 p Text br 2 Text /p 2 /body 2 /html Now, the table stays in place, where it should be. 
The /td 's are added automatically. 
Why not the /tr 's? 
I seem to recall that in earlier versions, these were added correctly. 
If I use the "hide-endtags" option, the following input: 1 !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 1 title /title 1 1 table summary="sum" 1 tr 1 td col_1 1 td col_2 1 /tr 1 /table 1 h1 header /h1 1 p Text br 1 Text results in the /tr tag being removed, while running it again on that output would result in the table being placed at the end of the output: 2 !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 2 title /title 2 2 h1 header /h1 2 p Text br 2 Text 2 table summary="sum" 2 tr 2 td col_1 2 td col_2 2 2 /table The /tr tag is once again removed.

I am using HTML Tidy as a plug-in in the most recent version of HTML-kit. 
Version information HTML-Tidy: 22-Oct-2002, HTMLTidy.dll 
Version information HTML-Kit : build 292, October 2002 As I mentioned in a follow-up mail, adding a /tr to the input (just before the /table solves the problem.

The TR is optional in HTML 4, so it shouldn't matter. 
A long time ago, I also found that Tidy messed up tables when you set (as Boudewijn did, or HTML-Kit did it for him): hide-endtags=yes ... and then ran Tidy on HTML code that was already missing the optional end-tags. 
But I can't replicate that in a recent build.
