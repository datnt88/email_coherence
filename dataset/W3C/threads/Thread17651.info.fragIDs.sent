<s> After reviewing the documents Jon referenced, I believe that there are some  </s>
<s> issues we need to consider based on an action item I am working on with Mark Novak for the PF group: We have to be careful of what we put in the DOM and do not put in the DOM.  </s>
<s> What I feel is needed is an interface that extends the DOM for a user agent.  </s>
<s> This way we can preserve the existing DOM for some of its intended purposes such as servlet processing of HTML pages where user interface issues are not of consideration.  </s>
<s> We need to create an AccessibleObjectModel which extends the DOM to application components.  </s>
<s> The DOM provides some key features that we can  </s>
<s> reuse namely an architected event model, a range model, an iterator, CSS  </s>
<s> to node mapping, and a tree structure.  </s>
<s> The new AccessibleObjectModel needs to be designed such that each document node can be constructed by a mapping of XML semantic schemas into each individual node.  </s>
<s> Position information is not important for all assistive technologies if  </s>
<s> we can provide accessible action sets for specific node types as specified by its schema.  </s>
<s> Screen reader technology may be interested in  </s>
<s> position information when it needs to determine where line breaks in text occur or if they need to map objects to an OSM representation.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> need for mapping to an OSM representation should be less important with  </s>
<s> true object model technology.  </s>
<s> Position information is very relevant to  </s>
<s> screen magnifiers that will use the caret or selector position to pan the magnification point to the users point of focus.  </s>
<s> Position information should not be stored in the core DOM because there it has no  </s>
<s> meaning in a non-visual orientation.  </s>
<s> This again is why we need to create  </s>
<s> a new AccessibleObjectModel that inherits from the DOM to provide this  </s>
<s> feature.  </s>
<s> Keyboard bindings could be specified for specify node types based on the  </s>
<s> schema.  </s>
<s> Although it would be up to the authoring tool and/or browser to  </s>
<s> define these, we will need to establish a set of key binding for specific node types that will not conflict with different operating system specific key bindings for obvious reasons.  </s>
<s> This is something we  </s>
<s> had to deal with for Java.  </s>
<s> On the issue of using standard rather than custom controls when designing user agents, the accessible object model should define an interface that can be applied to application object model components.  </s>
<s> The interface will provide the necessary information to access a particular object model component based on the specified XML schema.  </s>
<s> On  </s>
<s> some systems like UNIX with the X Windows System, these components may  </s>
<s> be part of someone's widget set.  </s>
<s> Allowing the browser (one user agent example) to map the proper semantic information to that component or node allows the user agent to use whatever widget set they like and still be accessible.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: The restriction to use standard controls is an unnecessary restriction if we design the Accessibility interface properly.  </s>
<s> Regarding the issue of "Allowing the user to turn on and off support for  </s>
<s> spawned windows" We need to develop and AccessibleApplication interface  </s>
<s> that can be implemented by a user agent so that an assistive technology  </s>
<s> can be notified when a spawned document has focus.  </s>
<s> This is again separate from the DOM.  </s>

<s> hi Jon Still reading about W3C DOM/DOM2, so..... Position information in terms of "relationship" (e.g., sibling, parent, etc.), yes.  </s>
<s> Position information in terms of X Y coordinates, no.  </s>
<s> However, having said that, in the DOM 2 draft 19990304, the UIEvent interface has 4 attributes, one for screenX, one for screenY, one for clientX, and finlly one for clientY., which according to their definitions refer to the x/y coordinate at which the event occurred in relative to the origin of the screen system, and likewise in relative to the DOM's implementation.?  </s>
<s> Also, many of the UI events (e.g., click, mouseup, etc.) have these attributes as context information.  </s>
<s> I'm guessing you are asking about what an element's position is, in a visual format, I think that would be its screen location, which is why I said "no" above.  </s>
<s> However, I believe you can figure this out from DOM2 support for stylesheets, perhaps someone can help here?  </s>
<s> This is not necessarily the case for current browser implemantations of a "DOM".  </s>
<s> For example, in the headerlist power toy clone script I developed, after I've found the string of text I was searching for, and verified that it is indeed a header, I can obtain the Y postion of this string, in relationship to the current scrolled (or not scrolled) "dynamic" position of the page, and then adjust the page accordingly such that if possible (if enough page still exists to scroll it) I can place the found header string at the top of view .  </s>
