<s> The source HTML documents use all upper-case tag  </s>
<s> names  </s>
<s> (the XHTML documents are valid XHTML so they use  </s>
<s> upper  </s>
<s> case tag names).  </s>
<s> Shouldn't that be lower case?  </s>
<s> That was a typo, tag names in XHTML are lower case.  </s>
<s> Microsoft IE does do this, so if I ask for getElementsByTagName("a"), I'll also get any A elements in the document.  </s>
<s> Mozilla 0.9.8 will not.  </s>
<s> Mozilla is correct (for XHTML) since 'a' and 'A' is not the same element; 'xhtml:A' does not exist.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer and Mozilla are both correctly case sensitive for XML (and XHTML).  </s>
<s> Their behavior differs  </s>
<s> for HTML documents.  </s>
<s> IE appears either to perform a  </s>
<s> case-insensitive match on the tag name, Mozilla performs a case-sensitive match.  </s>
<s> The statements on case sensitivity on HTML implementations in various documents appear to be inconsistant: Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM L2 Working Draft says that: The other thing is that when calling methods that are case insensitive when used on a HTML document (such as getElementsByTagName() and namedItem()) the string that is passed in should be lower case to work on both HTML and XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> Section 1.1.7 of the DOM L2 Core states that string comparisions are strictly binary and hence case-sensitive.  </s>
<s> Section C.11 of the XHTML 1.0 says that the HTML DOM that tagnames and attributes are returned uppercase.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer appears to conform to the behavior alluded to in Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM 2 WD. Mozilla appears to be conforming to the behavior implied by the other two sections.  </s>

<s> An element name is the string that appears in the start tag and end tag (not the NAME attribute).  </s>
<s> I really think that getElementsByTagName should be case-insensitive, too, for HTML documents.  </s>

<s> Absolutely.  </s>
<s> However, the problem is mostly focused on DOM *HTML* getElementsByTagName().  </s>
<s> Spec inconsistencies have spanned interpretation differences between Mozilla and IE implementations.  </s>
<s> I have to agree with Thomas Much that (as far as DOM Level 1 HTML), the best solution is to be case INsensitive to tag names and keep backwards compatibility with existing code and markup.  </s>
