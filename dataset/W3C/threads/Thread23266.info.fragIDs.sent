The source HTML documents use all upper-case tag 
names 
(the XHTML documents are valid XHTML so they use 
upper 
case tag names). 
Shouldn't that be lower case? 
That was a typo, tag names in XHTML are lower case. 
Microsoft IE does do this, so if I ask for getElementsByTagName("a"), I'll also get any A elements in the document. 
Mozilla 0.9.8 will not. 
Mozilla is correct (for XHTML) since 'a' and 'A' is not the same element; 'xhtml:A' does not exist. 
Internet Explorer and Mozilla are both correctly case sensitive for XML (and XHTML). 
Their behavior differs 
for HTML documents. 
IE appears either to perform a 
case-insensitive match on the tag name, Mozilla performs a case-sensitive match. 
The statements on case sensitivity on HTML implementations in various documents appear to be inconsistant: Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM L2 Working Draft says that: The other thing is that when calling methods that are case insensitive when used on a HTML document (such as getElementsByTagName() and namedItem()) the string that is passed in should be lower case to work on both HTML and XHTML documents. 
Section 1.1.7 of the DOM L2 Core states that string comparisions are strictly binary and hence case-sensitive. 
Section C.11 of the XHTML 1.0 says that the HTML DOM that tagnames and attributes are returned uppercase. 
Internet Explorer appears to conform to the behavior alluded to in Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM 2 WD. Mozilla appears to be conforming to the behavior implied by the other two sections.

You'd break existing code if you demand HTML to be case-sensitive. 
HTML has 
always been case-*in*sensitive. 
So, Mozilla should change it's behaviour for 
HTML documents.

According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-id the id attribute *is* case-sensitive in HTML 4.01, and in that respect, I'd say that the Gecko implementation is correct.

IDs and tag names are two different things - we're not talking about getElementById()! 
According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.1 "Element names are always case-insensitive". 
An element name is the string that appears in the start tag and end tag (not the NAME attribute). 
I really think that getElementsByTagName should be case-insensitive, too, for HTML documents.

Absolutely. 
However, the problem is mostly focused on DOM *HTML* getElementsByTagName(). 
Spec inconsistencies have spanned interpretation differences between Mozilla and IE implementations. 
I have to agree with Thomas Much that (as far as DOM Level 1 HTML), the best solution is to be case INsensitive to tag names and keep backwards compatibility with existing code and markup. 
Kindest regards, Manos 
Mozilla performs a case-sensitive match. 
It hasn't done that since October 30, 2000 [1]. 
Testing with current builds on an HTML document (including XHTML served as text/html) shows getElementsByTagName to be case-insensitive in Mozilla Boris [1] http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57495#c17 617-864-9910 Economists state their GNP growth projections to the nearest tenth of a percentage point to prove they have a sense of humor.
