<s> # 1. Introduction # "This is an update to the forms features found in HTML 4.01's forms chapter, ..." This is an update, though it is not a comprehensive replacement for the original.  </s>
<s> Perhaps add a second sentence at the end of the first  </s>
<s> paragraph, e.g.: "This specification does not describe the complete  </s>
<s> behaviour of an HTML or XHTML user agent, merely the differences from the original specification."  </s>
<s> # 1.2.  </s>
<s> Relationship to XForms Insert a new paragraph before the diagram along the lines of: "This diagram shows how a Web Forms 2.0-capable browser could provide the presentation layer for an XForms system:", if that's not too confusing a way to describe it.  </s>
<s> In the diagram, the 'HTML' document icon should indicate that it can either be an HTML or XHTML document, and (more importantly) that it refers to the modified 'Web Forms 2.0' dialect described in this document.  </s>
<s> # 1.3 Conformance requirements  </s>
<s> In RFC 2119, and many of the other documents that reference it, the key words ('MUST', etc.) are capitalised, while in this document, they are not.  </s>
<s> Append the sentence (from CSS 2.1): "However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification."  </s>
<s> # 2.1 Extensions to the input element I think that you should stress in the introductory paragraphs that the new input fields must all be able to accept a blank value in addition to their strongly-typed value.  </s>
<s> You also infer throughout the document that UAs may decide to allow arbitrary user input into a strongly-typed field.  </s>
<s> I assume that it is neither a requirement that UAs constrain entry only to valid input, nor a requirement that UAs not do this.  </s>
<s> In other words, a datetime field represented as an unconstrained input box in one UA, and as a datepicker control in another, are both equally conforming.  </s>
<s> A note to that effect would be useful.  </s>
<s> Could you provide guidance as to whether UAs will be expected to provide feedback to the user about what makes up the valid contents of an input field, or whether page authors should provide that information to the users?  </s>
<s> # datetime input type  </s>
<s> As you're trying to illustrate that the UA is expected to show an 'appropriate widget' (rather than force the user to use ISO8601), perhaps you could change the example to one that does *not* use the ISO8601 input format?  </s>
<s> # integer and numeric types As well as being compatible with scanf's format, is this format also compatible with ECMAScript's parseInt and parseFloat?  </s>
<s> If so, it would probably be worth mentioning that.  </s>
<s> # integer type The suggestion that a (visual) UA might display an integer input field in one of several presentation forms is well-meaning, but applies equally to all input types.  </s>
<s> Additionally, a UA would be unlikely to use a track bar control for an input control that might contain any value.  </s>
<s> # min and max As you specifically state that min and max apply to file upload controls, you should also explain what the meaning of min and max for these controls is in this section, as you do in section 2.4.  </s>
<s> # 2.2.  </s>
<s> Extensions to the select element # editable is ugly I don't know that there's anything that can be done to supress the uglyness of editable="editable".  </s>
<s> In any case, the same problem exists for disabled, multiple, readonly, required, ... # 2.5.  </s>
<s> Extensions to existing attributes # "some existing attributes from [HTML4] are clarified below."  </s>
<s> Nit: they're also being extended, not merely clarified.  </s>
<s> # name attribute, predefined meanings from RFC 3106.  </s>
<s> Is it worth noting that the reserved names in RFC 3106 are all prefixed 'Ecom_'?  </s>
<s> # 2.6.  </s>
<s> The pattern attribute You might want to note that you need to bind the pattern to the start and end of the line if you want to validate the entire field.  </s>
<s> i.e., that a pattern of '[0-9]{10}' will merely ensure that the field *contains* ten consecutive numbers, not that that is all it contains.  </s>
<s> This is a clear result of using regular expressions, but is different to many other environments, which do not allow patterns of this type, and so many people may not expect this behaviour.  </s>
<s> # 2.8.  </s>
<s> The form attribute What is the expected behaviour for a form control with a form attribute that does not refer to a valid form?  </s>
<s> I assume it should be ignored, per 2.15.  </s>
<s> # 2.12.  </s>
<s> The output element This section should probably appear with the rest of the elements, before section 2.5.  </s>
<s> # 2.14.  </s>
<s> Guidelines for using radio, checkbox, and select controls # "Using stylesheets it is possible to make select elements look like radio # buttons or check boxes."  </s>
<s> This may be possible with CSS3's 'appearance' property, but it is not possible in any current user agents, AFAIK.  </s>
<s> You should at least mention that this is a feature of CSS3, or risk confusing authors who might expect it to be possible in current user agents.  </s>
<s> # 4.1.  </s>
<s> Bubbling semantics I found this section easier to read if I mentally substituted 'document root node' for 'document node' in the last two paragraphs, and likewise, 'document root' for 'document' in the second-to-last paragraph.  </s>
<s> # 4.4.1.  </s>
<s> Declarative dependency tracking This section seems completely out of place.  </s>
<s> You specify the grammar of a declarative subset of ECMAScript, then go on to say that it doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> Better might be to mention that it is possible, give the example, then provide the grammar in an appendix.  </s>
<s> # 4.5.  </s>
<s> Form validation I take it that the formerror event is a new event.  </s>
<s> That's not clear from the introduction.  </s>
<s> Change: "The formerror event bubbles, as described in an earlier section."  </s>
<s> (it's the manner of bubbling that was described earlier, and not the fact that it bubbles).  </s>
<s> # 5. Form submission # "When the user agent submits a form (e.g., in response to the user ..." Remove the parenthetical clause?  </s>
<s> It's fairly obvious.  </s>
<s> # Steps Zero-based lists aren't cool, as list item two is now step numbered one.  </s>
<s> # 2. Step one: Identify all form controls This step is surely a pre-requisite for control validation (step zero)?  </s>
<s> # 3. Step two: Build a form data set The index used here is not related to the repetition index used in templates.  </s>
<s> It might be worth including a note to that effect to allay confusion.  </s>
<s> # 5.2.  </s>
<s> application/x-www-form-urlencoded # Step 4. Should the hexadecimal encoding be in upper- or lower-case?  </s>
<s> (probably upper case, per http://www.textuality.com/tag/uri-comp-4#good).  </s>
<s> Should *all* non [a-zA-Z0-9] characters be encoded in hex, save space?  </s>
<s> # 5.3.  </s>
<s> application/x-www-form+xml: XML submission The first paragraph should also be in 5.2 and 5.4, and not just in 5.3.  </s>
<s> # 5.4.  </s>
<s> text/plain Again, presumable the chosen encoding should be a superset of US-ASCII, similar to 5.2.  </s>
<s> # 5.5.  </s>
<s> Semantics of method and enctype attributes  </s>
<s> In the action tables, remove the 'Handle as if enctype was application/x-www-form-urlencoded.' and span the above text down, as is done for the 'delete' case, unless there is a difference.  </s>
<s> As it happens, you could also simplify the tables into two rows: 'enctype not specified, one file upload control' and 'otherwise'.  </s>
<s> In tables, I found it easier to read the cells if I did s/Drop the form data/Ignore the form data/, and s/Drop action/Ignore action/.  </s>
<s> # 5.5.2.  </s>
<s> For ftp: actions Span the 'post' and 'put' columns, removing the redundant text in the 'post' column.  </s>
<s> # 5.5.4.  </s>
<s> For file: actions Remove '(DELE)' from the delete column, copied from the ftp section above.  </s>
<s> # 5.5.6.  </s>
<s> For smsto: and sms: actions Remove this section for the moment - it is useless without a specification for the sms: and smsto: schemes.  </s>
<s> # 6. Fetching data from external resources As sections 6.1 and 6.2 are expected to occur in the opposite order (6.2 first), it would make sense to reverse them in the document.  </s>
<s> Could you provide a complete example form data file for one of the previously provided form examples?  </s>
<s> # 6.1.  </s>
<s> Seeding a form with initial values s/UAs must process this file if/UAs may only process this file if/  </s>
<s> # 7.2.1.  </s>
<s> The DOMMutableStringList interface FWIW, I read 'DOMMutableStringList' as 'a list of mutable strings'.  </s>
<s> How about 'DOMStringListMutable' (as in, 'DOM string-list, mutable')?  </s>
<s> # 7.2.2.  </s>
<s> The HTMLCollection interface s/ECMASCript/ECMAScript/ # 7.9.  </s>
<s> Loading remote documents # "These method is asynchronous, and are guarenteed to not finish loading the document # or signal an error before the running script either completes or yields to the user..." s/method is/methods are/ s/guarenteed/guaranteed/  </s>
<s> I've not mentioned editorial comments that I simply fixed or that became irrelevant due to larger changes.  </s>
<s> "What diagram?"  </s>
<s> It's only a diagram in graphical UAs.  </s>
<s> Actually, the diagram is redundant with the following paragraphs, so it's alt text is "", which would thus cause confusion if it was captioned.  </s>
<s> I guess.  </s>
<s> I've noted this down, but I am unlikely to update the diagram in the near future.  </s>
<s> I'll be marking up the RFC2119 terms at some point, styling them with small caps in an alternate stylesheet or some such.  </s>
<s> I've added notes like this in various places.  </s>
<s> I am awaiting implementation experience before commenting on this in the spec.  </s>
<s> Yeah, I'd like other widget examples.  </s>
<s> Again, noted, I'll see what I can do at some point.  </s>
<s> I think it is, note added.  </s>
<s> This is for parity with the numbering in HTML4.  </s>
<s> I've changed the list numbering to match the step numbering so they match.  </s>
<s> Again, parity with HTML4 is what is keeping this strange order.  </s>
<s> Actually it's not really a pre-req because of the (strange) way I've defined everything, but I see your point.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> It's what HTML4 says.  </s>
<s> Actually no, there's nothing wrong with UTF-16 or EBCDIC in this case as far as I know.  </s>
<s> The difference is the semantics -- the "Handle as" cases are "errors", the others are the actual cases.  </s>
<s> I want to keep the tables the same throughout that section.  </s>
<s> Again, the point here is that "post" is "wrong" and is being treated as "put".  </s>
<s> I don't know if maybe I should mention that (I don't know how to mention that).  </s>
<s> Political reasons.  </s>
<s> It'll be removed eventually unless a spec appears.  </s>
<s> Added to TODO list.  </s>
<s> No. RFC2119 terminology.  </s>
<s> Again, thank you very much for your input.  </s>
<s> It has been incredibly useful.  </s>
<s> I look forward to further comments at a later date, if you have the time!  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ian Hickson )\._.,--....,'``.  </s>
<s> fL U+1047E /, _.. \ _\ ;`._ ,.  </s>
<s> Ian,  </s>
<s> Point taken.  </s>
<s> However, I still think that the diagram needs a paragraph to introduce it.  </s>
<s> It's not until the paragraph *after* the diagram that you start to describe the transformation model, so when you hit the diagram, you've no idea what it's illustrating.  </s>
<s> If you move the diagram down by one paragraph, you'll get the 'overview' paragraph and then the diagram, which makes more sense (to me, anyway).  </s>
<s> Incidentally, is there any way you can make the diagram more compact?  </s>
<s> It really needs to be looked at while reading the text, but that's impossible given its current size.  </s>
<s> You, of all people, using presentation to imply semantics?  </s>
<s> I'm shocked!  </s>
<s> shocked!  </s>
<s> Sorry, couldn't resist.  </s>
<s> I guess that's ok, I'll just have to make sure I don't read the spec on my phone :)  </s>
<s> I've made two alternate examples for the datetime type (attached, I hope).  </s>
<s> Let me know if they're ok, and I might see if I can make some more.  </s>
<s> How should the receiver decode the character set in these cases?  </s>
<s> If a BOM is used, I could see that that would work, though you don't mention that (should you?).  </s>
<s> Is this just a case that the receiver should have some idea what it's being sent?  </s>
<s> # This algorithm does not directly parallel the algorithm for # application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  </s>
<s> This is mostly due to backwards # compatibility concerns.  </s>
<s> Those concerns are with the x-www-form-urlencoded algorithm, not this one, right?  </s>
<s> Oh, that's interesting: I hadn't realised that.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a note to that effect would be useful?  </s>
