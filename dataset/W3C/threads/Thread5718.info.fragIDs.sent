<s> Are there any official statemnts roadmaps, etc.? Buggy THe development of a W3C Recommendation for the OWL langauge has stopped - the group accomplished its mission - OWL became a recommendation in February (See http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL) as a result, the Working Group has achieved what it was chartered to do, and by W3C process it will end its work completely in the near future.  </s>
<s> That said, work in OWL and the Semantic Web certainly continues!  </s>
<s> The W3C now hosts a semantic web interest group and two new working groups - one to look at distributed access to RDF stores and one to develop semantic web best practices -- information about these can be found at the W3C Semantic Web page -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw and ruleML continues, just not as a W3C effort - they and other rule efforts can be found via a web search.  </s>
<s> So the work continues, just not here... -Jim Hendler Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler  </s>
