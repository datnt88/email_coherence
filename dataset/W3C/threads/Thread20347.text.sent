Dear Jose Kahan I have installed Amaya 2.2 and already downloaded Amaya 2.4. 
I rember reading on the website that one must uninstall any previous version befor updating. 
So I searched the Amaya website. 
But nowhere does it explain how to uninstall ?? Sorry if I seem dumb but I just dont know how. 
I have previous been exclusively a Windows user but now have a muliti-boot Win-Linux machine. 
I have no idea how to do the uninstall in Linux. 
can you please get this infor put onto the Amaya webpages as I am sure others may want to know. 
Any hints - advice - links - on how to do the uninstall for a Linux version much appreciated Yours John John Coombes (miesanz) Melbourne Victoria Australia Using Mandrake Linux v.7.0 + Netscape Comunicator 4.7 My Website :- http://www.users.bigpond.com/johncoom/

Hello John, In our previous episode, john coombes said: The comment is ambiguous. 
I just edited the doc to make it clearer. 
You need to uninstall any previous Amaya in the Windows platforms. 
Unix boxes don't have this problem. 
If you're using rpm, you can just do an rpm -U name_of_the_amaya_rpm and everything will be taken into account :) If you want to uninstall the previous version, you can do a "make uninstall" in the Amaya directory. 
I haven't tried it, but it should work. 
Sorry for the confusion. 
-Jose If you installed a .tgz 
version on a Unix system then removing it is simply a matter of deleting the directory where you put it. 
For example, I install Amaya in /usr/local/share/Amaya, but I also ahve a one line shell script at /usr/local/bin/Amaya that calls the binary from where it is installed. 
When I update my version of Amaya I usually put the new version into wherever I had the old version, so the shell command works fine. 
I also have a ~/.amaya directory where I keep preferences, a keyboard file, etc. 
That is only updated if I specifically do it - usually I manually copy the profiles and sometimes an ew amaya.keyboard 
file manually.

Perhaps I'm missing something obvious too ... I still can't see any instructions as to how to uninstall from Windows95. 
I could run my uninstaller of course, but the BinDist page clearly implies that there is an uninstall mechanism/procedure that will preserve user preferences. 
My present installation is 2.1 and I can't see anything in that version's manual about uninstalling and there is nothing titled "UnIns*" in the directories. 
I appear to still have v1.4a left lying in \program Files\Thot too ... can I safely dump everything in that directory tree? 
regards, Malcolm.

We do need an Uninstall doc page. 
In the meantime, I modified the text, trying to make it clearer: NOTE: You MUST first uninstall any previous version of Amaya from your system before installing this one. 
To do so, use a tool in the Windows control panel tool which allows to "install/remove programs" (the exact name depends on your Windows versions... mine is in French!). 
This is a standard Windows tool. 
You don't have to copy your Amaya user preferences as they won't be affected by this operation. 
Well, preferences are stored in that tree (see the Configuring Amaya doc page). 
If you scratch it, you'll loose them. 
And there will be some traces left in the Windows history of installed program. 
We'll try to improve the doc. 
If anyone has time and inspiration to give it a shot, feel free to do so. 
Hope this helps you out Malcolm, Cheers, -Jose + You're right.

In the meantime, I modified + the text, trying to make it clearer: Thanks, I didn't think the "Windows install/remove" facility would preserve preferences. 
I rarely use that, I generally use the uninstaller I have installed - because that gives me an un-uninstall facility!

Ah, yes, but only for v1.4a ... I see now where thot.rc is for 2.1, it's in the Program Files\Amaya hierarchy as I had hoped.

Don't look at me 8-) ... I struggle to find time to (properly) read the documentation that's already there! 
+ Hope this helps you out Malcolm, Yes thanks, I think I have it sorted in my mind now. 
better do some uninstalling and load up the current version ... regards, Malcolm.
