I need to evaluate for accessibility and am having trouble with the HTML. 
Sincle I'm blind, I also am not sure what the intention of the author is (vissually speaking). 
Here's a couple of mysteries I need help with: Note: I'm using IE4.x and Jaws for Windows as my screen reader. 
1) When first displaying the page, I see an MAP, which seems to be an image with hotspots to click on. 
When I clicked on one, it took me to a page with pointers back to the homepage and seemingly nothing else. 
When I used the tab key to move link to link, I started hearing what appeared to be section numbers. 
Sure enough, clicking on these numbers got me to some text. 
What is the intention here? 
2) NextLink, a blurb saying see page 30. 
Using the screen-reader functions to read the page by line, this link seems to be imbeded in some text describing the cover. 
The text, however, is not read when the page first displays. 
It does *sometimes* appear when I use the "format page" jaws function. 
I think this goes through the internet explorer internal objective discription of the document and changes the layout to allow easier reading. 
It creates single columns out of multiple ones and changes the position of frames to make them more readable. 
However, this document appears to make no use of frames, so why isn't the text spoken when the page is loaded? 
3) There is text (which is spoken on loading) which says "choose a section... No section numbers are spoken on loading but when using the tab key to navigate from link to link, they are spoken. 
Why? 
I hope at least some of this makes sense. 
I'm not real sure how to describe this stuff. 
Again, any help is much much appreciated. 
Rich Caloggero Hi, Rich, what you're encountering here is that you go from a main page *CLICK!* to a page with a map on it. 
That map shows the route of how to walk from somewhere to another. 
Dashed lines in various colors and patterns outline how to walk around. 
You then choose which part of the map to look at and *CLICK* go to a "zoomed in" version of that part of the map; in other words, blown up at a bigger scale. 
Then you can *CLICK* choose which building by clicking on it. 
There are "paths" that lead between the various building, which are numbered (the key appears on the side of the map, as an image -- you may be completely unaware of that! the map key lists numbers which correspond to numbers on the map, and the names of the building. 
Also, the numbers are color coded to correspond to the "paths" of the walking tours.) I don't know why it's loading or not loading, per se. 
These are formatted using tables; in fact the whole page heavily uses to tables to make a two-column arrangement. 
On the left column you have: * The cover graphic * A description of it On the right side: * directions link * the "key" to the map, described above * a message from the director * a special thanks link There's more stuff below this, but it's not in the column format. 
This looks like it's the imagemap. 
The image itself has an ALT attribute, but the various areas do NOT. 
You are read a number because that is what the links are named, 24.htm and 6.htm and so forth -- those are the names of the files linked to. 
What I can see tells me that 24, for example, should have ALT text that says "Oviatt Building" and 6 should be "Grand Market Central". 
This information is contained on the graphical map key. 
However, the map key itself has no need to be graphical in nature. 
It really should be presented as text beside numbers, which would be so much more accessible to everyone. 
In fact, the key is a low quality jpg image, which means it is blurry and hard to read when I, someone with (corrected by glasses) 20/20 vision, try to read it. 
The map key is a bad idea as an image overall. 
I hope I described enough for you to be able to identify what you are not able "see" (hear) from this. 
This page needs lots of work to make it usable, I think. 
You are losing too much information because of the way they have put it together; ideally, your description and my description should be the same in content even if the presentation is wrong, but I am seeing lots of things from this site that you have no access to. 
Hope this helps, --Kynn It's not accessible. 
For starters, they need ALT text for the image map hot spots. 
Using lynx, a person gets rather unhelpful links to URLS like: Which can only be navigated by trial and error. 
Most of the hot-spots are not available via textual links so you may be better off for this page with browsers other than IE or Netscape. 
This is all stuff that Bobby will tell you. 
The bigger challenge is how to adopt the walking tour directions so that they are usable to someone who is not sited. 
My impression is that the material would be very interesting to most people, including the blind. 
Many of the stopping points have obvious aural and tactile elements to them. 
Of course, you are being contracted by people who are basing a web site on a printed publication (hence the ridiculous link to page thirty) so you may have a great deal of work a head! 
Good luck!
