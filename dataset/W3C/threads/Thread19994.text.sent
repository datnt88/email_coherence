Another behaviour of Amaya that I find really annoying is that when it finishes loading a page into a window, this window puts itself in the foreground, i.e. rotates up to the top of the window hierarchy (I'm running under Unix/X11). 
This should be subject to the choice of the user in some configuration menu. 
Thanks, Karl-Michael In many cases, when you download a page you plan to read it? 
So I guess it's interesting to see the result when the download is finished. 
Isn't it? 
In the same way if you follow a link and the target page is already on your screen Amaya pops up the target page instead of doing nothing. 
Irene. 
Usually I have several applications running at the same time. 
So while Amaya is taking some time to load a page, I am typing input into another application. 
Then suddendly, Amaya pops up in the foreground and my typed characters go into the Amaya window instead into the other application where they should go. 
This is very annoying. 
What's the problem with making another menu entry to configure whether Amaya should go in the foreground when finished loading or not? 
I want to focus my attention to Amaya when I decide that it's time to do so, not when Amaya decides that I should pay attention to it. 
Karl-Michael I think this popup feature is annoying as well. 
Who is in charge in this situation, the user or the computer? 
If my manager asks me for some kind of report I will provide it, but I won't interrupt his meeting to give it to him, unless he tells me to. 
If the browser is not on the top of the window stack it is because the user doesn't want it there right now.
