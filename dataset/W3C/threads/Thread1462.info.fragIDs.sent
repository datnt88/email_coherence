<s> Hi, I just wanted to check that my understanding of Configurations and Components is correct....if the group agrees I could add this to the deltaV FAQ because I think the text in the specification can be easily misunderstood.  </s>
<s> The statement in section 12 says: "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all members of that root collection that are not members of another configuration."  </s>
<s> So given the collection structure: build +----- include  </s>
<s> +----- src +----- gui You cannot have a configuration rooted at build and another configuration rooted at build/src.  </s>
<s> But later in section 12 it says: "the root collection of a configuration can have a member that is the root collection of one of its components" So you can have a configuration rooted at build and a component rooted at build/src.  </s>
<s> Is my understanding of this correct?  </s>

<s> Hi, It was the text in section 12 where it says "... that are not members of another configuration" that leads to the confusion.  </s>
<s> Lets imagine you have the structure in the e-mail below and you put the build collection under baseline control by issuing a BASELINE-CONTROL request.  </s>
<s> Can you now issue another BASELINE-CONTROL request on build/src?  </s>
<s> I guess not since the resulting configuration would contain members of the configuration defined by the initial BASELINE-CONTROL request.  </s>
<s> Also the pre-condition (DAV:version-controlled-configuration-must-not-exist) would be triggered because build/src already has a version-controlled configuration property.  </s>
<s> BUT...I guess you could have done that in the reverse order...eg... If I issue a BASELINE-CONTROL method on build/src first I would then be able to later put the build collection itself under BASELINE-CONTROL.  </s>
<s> Is that right?  </s>
<s> Would the second baseline contain members from build and build/include but no members from build/src?  </s>
<s> Because the second configuration can not contain members from the first configuration?  </s>

<s> Maybe change to: "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all members of that root collection except those resources which are members of another configuration."  </s>
<s> IMO, that is a bit clearer that the resources *can* be in another configuration, and that they are excluded from the parent collection.  </s>
