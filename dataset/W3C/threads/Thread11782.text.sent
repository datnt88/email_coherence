In assigning checkpoints and techniques we came upon a decision that was not obvious: Should the point about "Including professionally written descriptions for all multimedia files (e.g., clip art) packaged with the software" be a checkpoint and therefore something that must or should be done or should it be a technique and therefore a suggested way of fulfilling the guideline 2.6? 
Jutta This sounds like a technique to me. 
The principle is: "Make it easy for users to suply alternative text." 
The technique is: "...by including default descriptions for things you give them." 
Anyone have suggested working for the checkpoint, though?

Actually, it sounds like a checkpoint to me - a thing which Authoring Tools "should" do to significantly increase the accesibility of the end product. 
It is certainly not a priority 1. Techniques for this include supporting the use of standards which allow information to be encoded with it (such as GIF), as well as asking User Agent Guidelines to consider providing access to that information.

Okay, I can see it that way.

The checkpoint would be a general urge to do something; the techniue should be to (among other things?) include canned (profesionally written?) descriptions. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Why I think it is a checkpoint: Including pre-written descripitions, which are generated by professionals, will provide a high-quality text ready-made. 
This significantly reduces the energy required of the author to improve the accessibility of the page by adding the description, and is likely to result in high-quality descriptions becoming standard. 
It doesn't stop people from writing better ones, merely provides a high 'clearing-floor level'. 
There are various ways that the information could be included, for example having a searchable database of images and descriptions, including them as 'summary information' in the format of the data itself, (GIF allows this - it is generally only used for making animated gifs, or providing image libraryies which came with a URL for each image that was a description of the image in some central registry. 
(This doesn't work offline, but does allow online users of the image to have the description cached, and therefore promotes the use of the image. 
Good for marketing, bad for people who like indivduality). 
Those methods are what I would consider techniques.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA I would argue that it is almost a checkpoint. 
Checkpoints should be in the approximate form of "provide this functionality." 
It should be obvious from the checkpoint what abilities the checkpoint provides. 
Hence, this isn't quite there yet. 
It is an arbitrary statement that you should "do this," without any explanation of why or to what extent. 
It also doesn't define what a "professionally written" description is: what profession? 
How detailed should the description be? 
The statement might be rephrased along the lines of: Provide a text-based means for the end user to determine the content of multimedia files (e.g. clip art). 
This phrasing would state the intent of the checkpoint, and be based on functionality. 
The technique associated with this checkpoint might be something like "Provide grammatically correct and descriptively accurate text documents and/or meaningful filenames that describe multimedia files. 
Now, on the other hand, is this the responsibility of the user agent? 
Do user *agents* include clip art and other multimedia files, or do they just render them? 
It seems pointless to require an agent to generate a description of files that come from elsewhere.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Denis, I did not include the entire text in my message. 
I was hoping people would refer to the present draft which has more of an explanation, justification and description of what needs to be done. 
The primary points here is that we are talking about the prepackaged media including clip art that are shipped with the authoring tool. 
The action we want is that they come with professionally written alt text and descriptions. 
This is an authoring tool developer action. 
Anyways, please refer to the present draft for clarification. 
Jutta Like at least one other person who's spoken up about this, I'm wondering about the term "professionals." 
I sense a new line of my sig coming on.

Actually I see this referring more to text used as longdesc than as alt. 
Using 'search', 'home', 'site index' etc should be a no-brainer. 
Appropriately describing my wife's painting of our apartment, which doesn't actually look quite like our apartment, is a whole different kettle of fish. 
Similarly for video description and such. 
I will happily write alt text, and descriptions for reasonably simple technical drawings, but interpreting artworks is something I find very challenging (and also lots of fun - in my spare time I love it).
