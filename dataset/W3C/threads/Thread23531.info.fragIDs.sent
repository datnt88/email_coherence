<s> Hello, These are comments for your DOM 3 Load and Save Proposed Recommendation [1] to use as you see fit.  </s>
<s> The document would benefit from adherence to a markup plan.  </s>
<s> Why for example is "read only node" a link twice in one paragraph?  </s>
<s> Why in LSParserFilter are Document and DOMImplementation not links (or marked up) in "the owner Document and DOMImplementation objects exist"?  </s>
<s> Why is Node marked up and capitalized sometimes and plain text others?  </s>
<s> Why is External XML Entity capitalized and not marked up?  </s>
<s> Load and Save section 1.3 says "The interface within this section is considered fundamental, and must be fully implemented by all conforming implementations of the DOM Load and Save module."  </s>
<s> Do you mean all of the "interfaces" (a typo) within section 1.3?  </s>
<s> If you do,  </s>
<s> then why does the introduction to section 1 say, "The functionality specified in this section (the Load and Save functionality) is sufficient to allow software developers and web script authors to load and save XML content inside conforming products."  </s>
<s> Do you mean all of the functionality specified in all of section 1?  </s>
<s> Section 1.3 says a DOM application may or must do some things.  </s>
<s> If the words may and must are meant in the RFC 2119 sense, then the document should state so.  </s>
<s> Further, it should credit the RFC and make it a normative reference.  </s>
<s> The Manual of Style has example markup [2].  </s>
<s> If may and must aren't used this way, then I would write an explanation of what you do mean by them.  </s>
<s> Statements like the following state requirements in different ways: "is," "will be," "are expected to."  </s>
<s> So, I can't search for conformance keywords (and really shouldn't have to).  </s>
<s> Maybe no one else would notice but I think this is worth mentioning to see what you think.  </s>
<s> - For all other types of nodes the serialized form is implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> - any occurrence of a character that cannot be represented in the output character encoding is reported as a DOMError fatal error - If inconsistencies are found, the serialized form of the document will be altered to remove them.  </s>
<s> - implementations are expected to raise implementation specific errors and warnings  </s>
<s> Maybe a section named "Conformance" would help Load and Save?  </s>
<s> The rest of this note is minor editorial.  </s>

<s> These sentences were pretty long and could be shortened something like: This specification does not attempt to define exactly when progress events should be dispatched.  </s>
<s> That is intentionally left as implementation-dependent.  </s>
<s> Here is one example of how an application might dispatch progress events: Once the parser starts receiving data, a progress event is dispatched to indicate that the parsing starts.  </s>
<s> From there on, a progress event is dispatched for every 4096 bytes of data that is received and processed.  </s>
<s> Same here: This DOMConfiguration is specific to the parse operation.  </s>
<s> No parameter values from this DOMConfiguration object are passed automatically to the DOMConfiguration object on the Document that is created, or used, by the parse operation.  </s>
<s> The source document must be an XML fragment.  </s>
<s> A fragment is anything except a complete XML document, a DOCTYPE (internal subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or text declaration(s).  </s>
<s> Note that a complete XML document with context node of type DOCUMENT_NODE and action ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN is a fragment.  </s>
<s> The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream, a character stream, or string data.  </s>
<s> It is still useful to provide one, since the application will use it to resolve any relative URIs and can include it in error messages and warnings.  </s>
<s> (The LSParser will only attempt to fetch the resource identified by the URI reference if there is no other input available in the input source.)  </s>
<s> For XML [XML 1.0] resources (i.e. entities), applications must use the value "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml".  </s>
<s> For XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1], applications must use the value "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema".  </s>
<s> The constants SHOW_ATTRIBUTE, SHOW_DOCUMENT, SHOW_DOCUMENT_TYPE, SHOW_NOTATION, SHOW_ENTITY, and SHOW_DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT are meaningless here.  </s>
<s> Those nodes will never be passed to LSParserFilter.acceptNode.  </s>

<s> That would be certainly nice but I don't think that someone is willing to take the entire document and search for those.  </s>
<s> Document and DOMImplementation are not linked because there are part of the Core and the scripts don't generate automatic link between DOM modules.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Yes. The sentence you mentioned is just after the table of contents and before the sub sections.  </s>
<s> I don't think changes are needed.  </s>
<s> DOM specifications never used the RFC 2119 explicitly and this is unfortunate The Manual of Style was published a long time after the publication of the publication of DOM Level 2.  </s>
<s> The conformance section for DOM Level 3 modules is included in the introduction of DOM Level 3 Core, as noted in the introduction of section 1.3.  </s>
<s> There is no need to repeat it across all DOM Modules.  </s>
<s> done.  </s>
<s> Not done, since a complete document is not a fragment.  </s>
<s> I kept the current wording.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> To double check, and please pardon a layman's terminology.  </s>
<s> The current wording is: The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e. anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where the context node of type DOCUMENT_NODE, and the action is ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN), a DOCTYPE (internal subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or text declaration(s).  </s>
<s> Because it is an exception to an exception, the latter case (a "complete XML document" "where the context node of type DOCUMENT_NODE, and the action is ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN") stays true.  </s>
<s> Or, put another way: Within the set of "anything," there is a subset named "except" containing complete XML documents, DOCTYPE, entity and notation declaration(s), XML or text declarations.  </s>
<s> Then within the subset "except" there is "(except in the case...)" that is called out as being not excepted.  </s>
<s> So I think the way this reads, it must be a fragment.  </s>
<s> Maybe though, the current wording is accurate and clear to those familiar with the DOM.  </s>
<s> I trust it will be fine.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply!  </s>
