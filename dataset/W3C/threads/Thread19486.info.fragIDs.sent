<s> These three sites did not pass W3C validation.  </s>
<s> They look OK to me.  </s>

<s> This one is fairly obviously broken, I don't understand why you can't see it from the validation report.  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd" HTML ^^^^^^^^ You are pusbing your luck by leaving out head and body, although I don't understand this one.  </s>
<s> These are obviously mismatched and center, being block level can't precede a closing inline tag.  </s>
<s> ^^^^^^^ You've implicitly started the body, but this is only allowed in head.  </s>
<s> Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind /center br /font /font title probably confuses this, but you're closing a block element so there can't be open inline elements like font.  </s>
<s> These have already been implicitly closed by the error recovery on /center Most of the rest is because it has been confused into thinking you are still in an implied head section.  </s>

<s> David-- Thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> I fixed http://www.neta.com/~cherry/42ex.html and I added a header.  </s>
<s> Also it seems the validator requires LF for the end of line.  </s>
<s> I had CR LF for end of line.  </s>
<s> It contains MATHML.  </s>
<s> Amaya displays all the MATHML in that file except &amp;prod;.  </s>
<s> Does the validator understand MATHML?  </s>
<s> Do I have to tell the validator that the document contains MATHML?  </s>
