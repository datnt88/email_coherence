Here is a clipping from an article about the Webby Awards. 
It's black-tie browsing time as the annual awards show announces contenders for best of the Web. by Paul Heltzel Break out the champagne and tell the guy who runs the server to take the night off. 
Nominees were announced today for the 1999 Webby Awards, which recognize sites for their creativity and innovation. 
Contenders for best site of the year range from Web darlings like 
Amazon.com (for Commerce) to lesser-known hopefuls, such as Red Meat (in Humor). 
Web-savvy celebrity judges include David Bowie for Music, Francis Ford Coppola in Film, and Esther Dyson in Finance. 
Ubiquitous Dilbert author Scott Adams will judge Humor. 
The average netizen can cast an online ballot for the People's Voice Awards, which will also be announced during the award ceremony, held March 18 at the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco. 
More than 200,000 Web users are expected to vote, says the award's organizer, the International Academy of Digital Arts &amp; Sciences (IADAS). 
And now, a full list of the nominees.

Lets start a discussion on the accessibility of their site. 
I am also going to ask them why they do not have a category for Universal Access. 
You too can ask, but please, let's be civil and positive.

Could someone give me the requirements of a text-only site? 
I need to 
impress upon a client that text-only does not just mean no graphics.

Do you mean a text-only site or a site that's accessible? 
A text-only site 
is just....text-only and has no graphics. 
A site that's universially accessible is easy to access via a text-only browser but can still be graphically oriented.

Text-only and accessible. 
They have a text-only site that uses frames. 
Is that considered accessible? 
Rhonda 
If you examine the W3C WAI Page Authoring Guidelines, it does indeed mention how to make frames accessible: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ A.9.1: For frames, provide a fallback page for pages that contain frames (e.g., by using NOFRAMES in HTML at the end of each frameset). 
[Priority 1] A.9.2: For frames, ensure that the source of each frame is a markup file, such as HTML. 
[Priority 1] B.1.1 Name each frame so that users can keep track of frames by name (e.g., via the "title" attribute on HTML FRAME elements). 
[Priority 1] B.1.2: Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each other if it is not obvious by frame names alone. 
(e.g., in HTML, use "longdesc". 
Until "longdesc" is widely supported, also use a d-link or invisible d-link).

I understand that you are asking about text-only guidelines and the use of Frames. 
I encourage webmasters to follow accessible web design guidelines and the use of Frames is a problem for accessibility. 
For an explanation of the accessibility problems in the use of Frames, I recommend that you visit the Starling Access web site at: There is also additional information at the World Wide Web Consortium site: W3C members may have additional urls for you to visit.

To disagree slightly with other responses to this, I think that a truly text-only site would also not include multimedia elements. 
Just saying that no use of graphics defines a text only site is too limited. 
Also, even a text only site can be inaccessible. 
ASCII art and improper use of frames can trash even a text only site. 
(Of course, I think any use of frames trashes any site.) -Jamie Fox Of Rhonda Vandine (CSPACE) Could someone give me the requirements of a text-only site?

This is how I see it: A text-only site is generally widely accessible (but not universally so - there are people who rely on well designed visual cues for important information they cannot satisfactorily extract from slabs of text) if: - It is well organised, and easily navigable - It does not use Frames inaccesibly (for simple 2 or three Frame framesets this is easy to do, it is just very rarely done.) - Where it is an alternative to a multimedia site, there is equivalent information to that contained in the multimedia elements. 
(ie a fancy divider graphic can be ignored, or replaced with an HR, but an important graph of something needs a description.) - It does not use tables in a manner which is inaccessible. 
Since the implementation of tables in many text-based browsers or combinations is pretty poor, this is a fairly restrictive requirement. 
The short answer is 'don't use them for layout, and if you have a complex table of data you need to think pretty hard about how to present it'. 
- Any 'ASCII art' is clearly marked as such, and a description is available. 
- It does not have links into inaccessible documents or objects. 
A site which does not meet these requirements MAY still be accessible, and a site which does meet them MAY NOT be accessible. 
They are a rough guide to the principles I use when looking at a text-only website. 
(Since my standard browser is Lynx, I do a lot of looking at text-only versions, whether they are seperate copies or just the rendering of a graphically designed site.) 
Is that the sort of thing you wanted to know?
