<s> Is that considered accessible?  </s>
<s> Rhonda  </s>
<s> If you examine the W3C WAI Page Authoring Guidelines, it does indeed mention how to make frames accessible: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ A.9.1: For frames, provide a fallback page for pages that contain frames (e.g., by using NOFRAMES in HTML at the end of each frameset).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] A.9.2: For frames, ensure that the source of each frame is a markup file, such as HTML.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] B.1.1 Name each frame so that users can keep track of frames by name (e.g., via the "title" attribute on HTML FRAME elements).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] B.1.2: Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each other if it is not obvious by frame names alone.  </s>
<s> (e.g., in HTML, use "longdesc".  </s>
<s> Until "longdesc" is widely supported, also use a d-link or invisible d-link).  </s>

<s> I understand that you are asking about text-only guidelines and the use of Frames.  </s>
<s> I encourage webmasters to follow accessible web design guidelines and the use of Frames is a problem for accessibility.  </s>

<s> d'Avray Hall, UNB  </s>
<s> This is how I see it: A text-only site is generally widely accessible (but not universally so - there are people who rely on well designed visual cues for important information they cannot satisfactorily extract from slabs of text) if: - It is well organised, and easily navigable - It does not use Frames inaccesibly (for simple 2 or three Frame framesets this is easy to do, it is just very rarely done.) - Where it is an alternative to a multimedia site, there is equivalent information to that contained in the multimedia elements.  </s>
<s> (ie a fancy divider graphic can be ignored, or replaced with an HR, but an important graph of something needs a description.) - It does not use tables in a manner which is inaccessible.  </s>
<s> Since the implementation of tables in many text-based browsers or combinations is pretty poor, this is a fairly restrictive requirement.  </s>
<s> The short answer is 'don't use them for layout, and if you have a complex table of data you need to think pretty hard about how to present it'.  </s>
<s> - Any 'ASCII art' is clearly marked as such, and a description is available.  </s>
<s> - It does not have links into inaccessible documents or objects.  </s>
<s> A site which does not meet these requirements MAY still be accessible, and a site which does meet them MAY NOT be accessible.  </s>
<s> They are a rough guide to the principles I use when looking at a text-only website.  </s>
<s> (Since my standard browser is Lynx, I do a lot of looking at text-only versions, whether they are seperate copies or just the rendering of a graphically designed site.)  </s>
<s> Is that the sort of thing you wanted to know?  </s>
