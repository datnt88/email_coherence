<s> There may be a Catch-22 here.  </s>
<s> Who is the documentation of the Web client for?  </s>
<s> Someone who doesn't fully understand how to use the Web client.  </s>
<s> To be fit for use by the intended audience, maybe the Web client documentation should not be hidden behind the Web client UI?  </s>
<s> The standards for the user's safety net are appropriately more severe [as regards accessibility] than the standards for general Web literature.  </s>
<s> Just as fire escapes have to be more fireproof.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Then maybe instead of putting the entire online documentation under the umbrella of providing it in plain text, it should just be those parts relating to accessibility?  </s>

<s> I would want to hear how David feels about this.  </s>
<s> However, for myself, I would be inclined to believe that it could be a subset.  </s>
<s> While this subset is correlated with the accessibility features, that is not exactly how I would frame it.  </s>
<s> I would look at learning the UI as a progressive learning experience and frame a bootstrapping sequence which prioritizes skills.  </s>
<s> One can probably isolate a core set of skills that ensures you can manage the rest of the course materials.  </s>
<s> The first bit of the course needs to be extremely robust to be sure to get everyone on board the lifeboat.  </s>
<s> That is an area where Microsoft has scored big with the general audience: the first step is _not_ a big one.  </s>
<s> But it may be necessary to walk through "the first step" in _several_ different adaptive-tech modes to be sure that the ease of getting started is there for everyone.  </s>
<s> That is how it strikes me.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> PS: a very accessible, access-smart installer is on my Christmas list.  </s>
<s> That seems to be one of the process steps where independence goes right out the window.  </s>
<s> in the interest of providing the most universal access, the entire documentation online, manual, and other including the sereal number of the cd should be available in a conventional electronic form.  </s>

<s> I agree here, but there are certain types of learning that compell one to have a "book" available as they work through the steps to using a product.  </s>
<s> If the subset approach is taken, it would have to include more than just the accessability features to help beginners get off the ground as al pointed out.  </s>
<s> A side benefit to putting the whole thing in plain text is that it would provide a chance to see if it relly reads the way it should.  </s>
<s> Often, we do things differently for the html (hypertext environment), then we would for text which can cause disastrous results for the reader.  </s>
<s> We actually, I am willing to forgo the ease of using the html during the reading of the text document just to get a handle on what's there and how it works.  </s>
<s> I'll use the hypertext to click where I'm told to go for this and that much better once I already know where I'm going.  </s>
<s> so not to put to fine a point on it, if you put it in plain text and review it from that standpoint, you may decide to change the hypertext version because of things that jumpped out at you while reading the text version.  </s>
<s> Considder the following: "the brown fox Jumpped over the (click here).".  </s>

<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> What matters is that the access system be accessible.  </s>
<s> By asking for plain text dumps, it's an additional work item for the product group.  </s>
<s> I'd rather the product group work on making the product accessible.  </s>
<s> I'm not trying to shoot down your idea, since Microsoft does make an effort at providing plain text documentation for some products that have printed manuals that are not duplicated in the help system.  </s>
<s> It's just that there are finite resources and time and I'd like them to concentrate on the big-ticket items.  </s>
