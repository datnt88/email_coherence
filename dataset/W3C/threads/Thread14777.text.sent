Has anyone seen an example of the following: a static link that is the place-holder for a current picture? 
for example this could be a picture of the singer from the current No1 single, where the link name and address is static from week to week, or a news site where the image changes from day to day, but the link is static. 
Rationale: we have a lot of work updating our links, which could possibly be avoided. 
thanks jonathan chetwynd peepo project manager This is one place where PNG would be very nice - since it has the ability to embed text in the image file, thus having the text travel around with the graphic. 
A tool could pull the text out -- or future access technologies could.

On Behalf or static. 
All the documents on the TR page at w3.org have a 'latest' link in them that is of this class. 
For example http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/. 
There are two ways to do this. 
The easiest is if you have a file system that supports soft pointers, and make the URL lead to the soft-pointer that you can change. 
There are other ways to do it in the server configuration data depending on the server. 
The problem is that you want both an URL for the specific image and a logical URL for the current role-filling image. 
Another example is http://lynx.isc.org/current/ 
Doing this with a server is also possible. 
Apache does it - there is a file called .htaccess which can temporarily or permanently redirect what you ask for (the URI of the current thing) to the particular instance (the URI that a particular image lives at permanently).
