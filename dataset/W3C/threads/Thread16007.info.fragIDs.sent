Hello all Yesterday (30 of June), the Portuguese Parliament approved the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet as recommendation to the Government. 
Now, the Portuguese Government should adopt the necessary measures to guarantee full accessibility of government and public services web information. 
The Web Accessibility Initiate was mentioned in the parliament report. 
Next week we will prepare a press release and the English translation of the Portuguese Parliament position concerning web accessibility.

Hello again Following the Portuguese Parliament recommendations concerning the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet, the President of the Portuguese Mission for the Information Society (in representation of the Minister of Science and Technology) announced today (July, 2), in meeting held in Lisbon (Portugal) with the representatives of the European Blind Union, WAI (Charles McCathieNevile ), PASIG and the Portuguese National Rehabilitation Secretary that, during this month, the Govern will approve a Ministry Council resolution that will make mandatory web accessibility to online information published by the Portuguese government and public services. 
During my speech I expressed a wish that during the Portuguese Presidencies of the European Union Council and Western European Union, that will take place during the first semester of the year 2000 (http://www.min-nestrangeiros.pt/min-nestrangeiros/politica/ue2000/emolp.htm l.en), the Portuguese government take actions to stimulate and promote similar measures in other European Countries. 
With this in mind, maybe some of you could begin a European strategy for web accessibility.

GUIA/PASIG - Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest Group -----Original Message----- Hello Judy, Tomorrow, February 17, PASIG (Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest Group) will submit to the Portuguese Parliament the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet. 
The web accessibility discussion will be now at the Portuguese Parliament. 
During 60 days (from 1998/12/03 to 1999/01/31) we collected 8,721 individual signatures (we needed 4,000 to submit the Petition) and the support of 149 organizations.

We believe (hope) that by June 1999, Web Accessibility could be law in Portugal. 
Could you update Portuguese Information in the "Policies Related to Web Accessibility " ?
