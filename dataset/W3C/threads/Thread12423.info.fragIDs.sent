I have prepared a set of powerpoint '97 slides on the recent guidelines. 
I did not have time to await the official set being developed in the EO working group. 
They are a contribution to that effort. 
I present them Wednesday, 19980923 at the Web conference in Boston, Hynes Convention Center Room 104 6:00 to 7:30 at a Birds of a Feather session. 
I'd welcome your presence. 
I was volunteered for this a week ago, and knew the latest and greatest draft was soon to be released. 
So, I've spent today readying the talk based on that 19980918 release. 
As they include a W3C WAI logo their size ballooned by a factor of 2 to 186Kbytes. 
That makes them inaccessible over email to so many. 
Please have a look at them from my site: or that file pkzipped (33Kbytes): I'd appreciate any critique and suggestions on repairs to them before noon tomorrow.

Hope the following is helpful: On page 8 the slide says: 
Provide redundant information to allow understanding entirely - visually - aurally 
For newbies in the audience, is it worth adding: "HTML text can be aurally accessed via audio browsers or screen readers." 
so they know they don't need to provide real-audio of every page. 
On page 25 of your presentation it states: 
Ensure that form control labels are either immediately following control on same line... 
Shouldn't the label immediately precede, rather than immediately follow, the control? 
Hope the presentation goes well.

In response to the suggestions of both Brian Kelley and Chuck Oppermann, I've put two HTML versions of these slides out. 
I produced these using Convert to HTML from PowerPoint 97. 
These are briefly described in: or start in the directory with the html version of the page authoring guidelines: Zip file containing those 130 files: Original PowerPoint '97 file and zip of it:
