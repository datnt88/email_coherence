Re. I'm afraid I do not understand what the issue is to which I am expected to respond. 
The semantics document introduces the xsd:prefix with the following text (section 0.2): "We will also make extensive use of the Qname prefixes rdf:, rdfs: and xsd: defined as follows: Prefix rdf: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# Prefix rdfs: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# Prefix xsd: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# 
Since Qname syntax is not legal N-triples syntax, and in the interests of brevity and readability, we will use the convention whereby a Qname is used without surrounding angle brackets to indicate the corresponding uriref enclosed in angle brackets, eg the triple ex:a rdf:type rdfs:Property . 
should be read as an abbreviation for the N-triples syntax http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Property ." 
Can someone (Jeremy?) tell me in what way this is misleading?

Jeremy Pat, Can I suggest you reply to jjc's email to Joseph pointing out the text you have here and ask him if he feels that covers the issue. 
There's a good chance he will withdraw the comment. 
Brian As an aside, do you intend to actually "require" a particular QName prefix when it says, "which we will refer to as XSD and use the Qname prefix xsd:. 
Re. the above, the answer is no, it does not. 
The Semantics document introduces the xsd: Qname as follows (section 0.2): "We will also make extensive use of the Qname prefixes rdf:, rdfs: and xsd: defined as follows: Prefix rdf: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# Prefix rdfs: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# Prefix xsd: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#

Does this cover the issue you have raised?
