<s> thank u, george p.s. on step 1 of http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html it says "On i both /i Windows and Unix" run winConfigure.pl  </s>
<s> but then at step 2 it looks like Unix users should have run libtoolize first, so step 1's reference to unix users should be removed.  </s>
<s> It's probably a problem of presentation.  </s>
<s> Point 2 is not the step after Point 1.  </s>
<s> We should define only one Point 1 with two options: Windows platforms, Unix platforms.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> are the openmotif/lesstif and GTK versions the "same" functionnaly speaking ?  </s>
<s> the question is about SVG support : from amaya web site it is unclear to me if -- or not -- svg support is better on openmotif version ?  </s>
<s> I've tried to install amaya with the openmotif flag however i rais to the GTK (default) ?  </s>
<s> Both version offer now the same support (including SVG edition support)  </s>
<s> Yes they are now.  </s>
<s> It was true before the release 6.2.  </s>
<s> I followed the instructions for unix install but I got stuck on both the tarball and CVS installs at make all, because it had alot of errors like ../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:134:24:  </s>

<s> You and CBee are correct (thank u) -- in addition to the Lesstif rpm i had to install the lesstif-devel rpm, because that has the missing files.  </s>
<s> But after  </s>
<s> installing that rpm and re-running ../configure and make, I get the same missing  </s>
<s> file errors, from both configure and make.  </s>
<s> ../configure returns "Motif includes were not found Amaya might not compile".  </s>

<s> Xm/Xm.h:  </s>

<s> Xm/PushBG.h:  </s>
<s> No such file or directory until, that is, I deleted the Options file and re-ran ../configure.  </s>
<s> (Since I didn't touch that Options file, I didn't have any settings in there i didn't want overriden, so maybe configure should warn the user when it won't write new settings.)  </s>
<s> Now make worked and amaya runs.  </s>
<s> (Its warnings were mostly of type ../../thotlib/base/registry.c:1498:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive.)  </s>

<s> # make clean, however, leaves as is the LINUX-ELF/Options file (a file which, again, was auto'ly generated).  </s>

<s> Running # make all, therefore, still uses old options.  </s>
<s> So I had to delete the Options file to put a new ../configure -- options command into effect.  </s>
<s> fyi, george  </s>
