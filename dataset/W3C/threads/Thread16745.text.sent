I am new to the list and Web Compliance. 
I am trying to find out what the feeling is toward online forms...that is, forms that can be filled out online. 
I don't see any reference to forms in the information I have read. 
Are these a No No, or does it depend on how they are presented? 
Thanks for any information on this subject. 
Randy Hemm, MCSE Web Server Administrator Division of Information Systems and Communications Department of Administration State of Kansas 785-296-8347 Forms you can fill out online are neither anathema nor panacaea. 
Evidently you haven't read either the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines nor the draft User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. 
Both of these contain information clarifying what works and doesn't work in online forms. 
As a service provider, you should offer and advertise an alternative to Web forms, for example via 800 number and/or plain text email. 
But web forms can be highly successful in serving people with disabilities. 
From what little I know, people with disabilities are significantly involved in using Web commerce and Amazon.com is a generally usable site, for example. 
Al Randy Welcome to the list... 
I am not sure it you are covered by the section 508 legislation, but if you are you will need to ensure that your on-line forms are consistent with 1194.22(n) of that legislation:- 'When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.' 
This of course begs for a definition of 'assistive technology', you will need to decide what assistive technology to test with. 
I have written an article on producing accessible forms in Domino, if you are interested in that email me. 
So, to answer your question, they are not a no-no and it does depend on how they are presented.
