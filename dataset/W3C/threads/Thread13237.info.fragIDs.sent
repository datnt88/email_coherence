Re the editing on ERT I'm doing per our last ER call. 
My work so far is up at Note: Make sure you type in the IG. 
There's a different version at www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ert-20000228.html /* OLD do not use */ which I'm unable to erase due to glitches in the change control system.l

Len, It's much clearer to me now that you have distinctly specified the element that must be tested. 
Are you going to finish to the end of the doc before Wendy and I have a go at it?

Chris, I'm glad you're finding it clearer. 
( and thanks to Michael for talking about how you-all think in terms of elements which gave me the idea to write it that way). 
As for me finishing it before you and wendy had a go at it again.. well my plan was to go through the whole thing. 
Taking longer than I thought... which is probably less surprising to you and wendy than to me grin . 
I'll whack away at it for whatever free time I have today and see how far I get. 
After that I may ask for us to figure out how to work in parallel so I don't hold up what you and wendy want to do on it.
