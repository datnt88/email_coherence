Hi All, If anyone has an example handy of a stylesheet used for indentation or multi-column layout, etc., could you please point me to it? 
Ideally where I can examine the css along with the result.

Dear Patrick: You may find one the CSS example resources at the Web-Savvy site (Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of Toronto) Check: http://snow.utoronto.ca/web-savvy/resources/css/css.html 
Hope this helps!

The templates provided in the latest version of "techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility" - http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10-TECHS with the stylesheet at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10-TECHS/templates/cmnStyle.css 
This stylesheet relies on floats (and uses block display as well) to provide columnar display, and contains a few margins. 
Words of caution: the float propoerty doesn't work in IE 5.0 for the Macintosh (it did for IE4.5 on the Mac - version 5.0 wasn't available when these were tested :-( so it looks a little funny on that browser. 
There is also a bug in IE 3's interpretation of margin-bottom (I think) that makes a big mess if it is less than 1em. 
You might like to check the CSS page as well - that has a number of useful resources listed - http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS cheers Charles McCN Hi All, If anyone has an example handy of a stylesheet used for indentation or multi-column layout, etc., could you please point me to it?

Multi-column layout isn't very difficult using style sheets. 
You can see a simple example at URL: http://home.no.net/huftis/gratismusikk/ (this works in (at least) IE, Opera and Mozilla). 
This page also works very well when the browser don't support style sheets (e.g. Lynx). 
When you're using CSS to create a multi-column layout, please note that IE (5) has a bug. 
The 'width' property should set the width of the 'content' (and padding, border and margin should be added to this). 
IE thinks 'width' sets the width of the margin box (content+padding+border+margin). 
An example: div#column1 { float: left; width: 50%; padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } div#column2 { float: right; width: 50%; padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } In IE, each column would occupy 50 % of the available width, but in conforming browsers (i.e. browsers that support CSS *correctly* -- like Opera 3/4, Konqueror or Mozilla 5/Netscape 6), each column will occupy much more than 50 %, causing horizontal scroll bars. 
The solution is the put each column in an extra box: And use a style sheet similar to this: div#container1 {width: 50%; float: left; } div#container2 {width: 50%; float: right; } div#column1 { padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } div#column2 { padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } Karl Ove Hufthammer 
I would like to continuously evaluate my site with screen reader software. 
I notice that JFW is very expensive at $795. 
Is there anything else that might do the job. 
Is pwWebSpeak a good option? 
Paul Stauffer CDER Webmaster staufferp@cder.fda.gov 
pwwebspeak is a good option and so is ibm home page reader. 
in addition, you can get jfw as a free demo download and window eyes as well. 
for jfw: for window eyes,: for pwwebspeak, for ibm home page reader: 
oh, one more thing. 
it is advisable for jfw and window eyes that you gain familiarity close to that of a regular user. 
In opperating these tools, inexperience can be quite telling. 
Paul, yes, PWWebSpeak is a good, inexpensive option. 
So is IBM's Home Page Reader. 
But concerning the costs of the screen reader packages, why not just get a demo copy of the pacage, such as JFW, Window eyes, Dolphin's Super Nova, Artic's WinVision and SyntheVoice's Window Bridge. 
I believe the only one that costs any $is JFW for $30 for a full version of the software that times out after 30 days. 
The other pakages have free demo packages which usually timout after 20 minutes. 
Hope this helps.
