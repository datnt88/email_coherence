<s> Words of caution: the float propoerty doesn't work in IE 5.0 for the Macintosh (it did for IE4.5 on the Mac - version 5.0 wasn't available when these were tested :-( so it looks a little funny on that browser.  </s>
<s> There is also a bug in IE 3's interpretation of margin-bottom (I think) that makes a big mess if it is less than 1em.  </s>

<s> Multi-column layout isn't very difficult using style sheets.  </s>
<s> You can see a simple example at URL: http://home.no.net/huftis/gratismusikk/ (this works in (at least) IE, Opera and Mozilla).  </s>
<s> This page also works very well when the browser don't support style sheets (e.g. Lynx).  </s>
<s> When you're using CSS to create a multi-column layout, please note that IE (5) has a bug.  </s>
<s> The 'width' property should set the width of the 'content' (and padding, border and margin should be added to this).  </s>
<s> IE thinks 'width' sets the width of the margin box (content+padding+border+margin).  </s>
<s> An example: div#column1 { float: left; width: 50%; padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } div#column2 { float: right; width: 50%; padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } In IE, each column would occupy 50 % of the available width, but in conforming browsers (i.e. browsers that support CSS *correctly* -- like Opera 3/4, Konqueror or Mozilla 5/Netscape 6), each column will occupy much more than 50 %, causing horizontal scroll bars.  </s>
<s> The solution is the put each column in an extra box: And use a style sheet similar to this: div#container1 {width: 50%; float: left; } div#container2 {width: 50%; float: right; } div#column1 { padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } div#column2 { padding: 1em; margin: 1em; border: 0.2em solid red; } Karl Ove Hufthammer  </s>
<s> I would like to continuously evaluate my site with screen reader software.  </s>
<s> I notice that JFW is very expensive at $795.  </s>

<s> Paul Stauffer CDER Webmaster staufferp@cder.fda.gov  </s>
<s> pwwebspeak is a good option and so is ibm home page reader.  </s>
<s> in addition, you can get jfw as a free demo download and window eyes as well.  </s>
<s> for jfw: for window eyes,: for pwwebspeak, for ibm home page reader:  </s>
<s> oh, one more thing.  </s>
<s> it is advisable for jfw and window eyes that you gain familiarity close to that of a regular user.  </s>
<s> In opperating these tools, inexperience can be quite telling.  </s>
<s> Paul, yes, PWWebSpeak is a good, inexpensive option.  </s>
<s> So is IBM's Home Page Reader.  </s>
<s> But concerning the costs of the screen reader packages, why not just get a demo copy of the pacage, such as JFW, Window eyes, Dolphin's Super Nova, Artic's WinVision and SyntheVoice's Window Bridge.  </s>
<s> I believe the only one that costs any $is JFW for $30 for a full version of the software that times out after 30 days.  </s>
<s> The other pakages have free demo packages which usually timout after 20 minutes.  </s>
