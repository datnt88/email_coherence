Please can you send URLs/descriptions of sites which have alternative 
accessible versions, e.g. www.tesco.com and www.tesco.com/access. 
Send directly to me and I'll summaries for the list. 
Thanks, Steve 
Is one of those seriously meant to be a "version" of the other? 
It gives good access to the Grocery services of Tesco, which I think would be the best part of the site for users with disabilities. 
I know if I was going to Tescos site it wouldn't be for half of the other nonsense on there (although banking services are disappointingly not there) Also, I like the way they have explained on their sign up form: "This is the first of two registration pages" 
If I was buying my groceries online, I think I would be using the access version.

Is one of those seriously meant to be a "version" of the other? 
I probably would too (accessibility isn't the only issue with frames) if I ever saw a reason to sign-up. 
Before signing up all I know about the service from the /access/ page is that it is accessible. 
Indeed I don't even know that, I have to take their word for it. 
Jon, The answer is, yes. 
I have some background on this: Lois Wakeman 
I seem to remember that Tesco argue that they can only provide the main site if they can use scripting, as their server is otherwise overloaded. 
Because of the registration requirements, I haven't 
looked further, but one wonders if some of this is due to bloat. 
Did you make the effort to speak to someone who should know, or was that 
a case of fobbing you off from some droid accustomed to telling people they need to plug their computer in? 
Now if Google were to say something like that whilst remaining the leading search engine, I might have to give it some thought before dismissing it as nonsense. 
But I'll confidently predict that if google were to go down that road they'd rapidly lose their leading position, and that they won't do any such thing until and unless the Suits take charge there.

It was either on their web site or on the radio; anything I do regarding accessibility is in my own time and at my own cost.
