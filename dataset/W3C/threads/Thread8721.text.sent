I have a problem with understanding what the KeyInfo- KeyValue element should contain. 
Among other things KeyValue is a possible child of KeyInfo, as it is stated in section 4.4: !ELEMENT KeyInfo ((KeyName | KeyValue | RetrievalMethod | X509Data | PGPData | MgmtData)*) Now, if one wants to produce a Signature using the DSA algorithm, section 6.4.1 tells that the DSA key values are defined as follows: So, what does that mean for the KeyInfo element? 
As I would interpret our draft, the following instance of KeyInfo is valid: Please can somebody tell me if I am right? 
(Wheter or not I am right, I think there is a need for some clarification on that topic). 
By the way, in the example given in section 10 also DSA is used as signature method. 
KeyInfo is printed as follows: KeyValue MIIBtzCCASwGByqGSM44BAEwggEfAoGBAP1/U4EddRIpUt9KnC7s5Of2EbdSPO9EAMMeP4 2USZpRV1AIlH7WT2NWPq/xfW6MPbLm1Vs14E7gB00b/JmYLdrmVClpJ+f6AR7ECLCT7up1/63xhv4O 1fnxqimFQ8E+4P208UewwI1VBNaFpEy9nXzrith1yrv8iIDGZ3RSAHHAhUAl2BQjxUjC8yykrmCouu EC/BYHPUCgYEA9+GghdabPd7LvKtcNrhXuXmUr7v6OuqC+VdMCz0HgmdRWVeOutRZT+ZxBxCBgLRJF nEj6EwoFhO3zwkyjMim4TwWeotUfI0o4KOuHiuzpnWRbqN/C/ohNWLx+2J6ASQ7zKTxvqhRkImog9/ hWuWfBpKLZl6Ae1UlZAFMO/7PSSoDgYQAAoGAQFL0+RhXZbDxdt17o05PlMzQGqDnAq2NM1eun+ie2 14okrmIp4r0CGKvHM1HbFgwXMlBpkXyStYg64RTMnL9dtShw5rCkEv145TV0EYVoxBQ5X0gmrQ2Nft RHH8imBhx9glz//y6NE4JhfIVPu3o+55VYUwdFP0cbBvWkKOngo0= I don't think that this is a possible option.

Gregor Gregor Karlinger Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria TO:Gregor.Karlinger@iaik.at,w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org Gregor, I think you're correct. 
The syntax of keyValue is based on the algorithm and so for DSA is would use the DSAKeyValue element, and would be While another alg could be --encoded binary key-- It appears our current syntax mandates a single keyvalue format for any given algorithm (since there's no attribute in keyValue, the syntax is derived from SignatureMethod?); but I may have missed something.

Gregor Gregor Karlinger Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria Hello Joseph, I think my problem of understanding this matter is also related to my misinterpretation of the (#PCDATA) content model. 
KeyValue is declared as which allows the instance example I have given in my article: But maybe we could clarify the intended meaning of KeyValue, as you already suggested in your answer to my Object DTD article: Gregor Gregor Karlinger Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria
