There are now user agents that allow this in various ways. 
There are also user agents which take the alternative approach, of informing the user. 
For example iCab does this visually. 
There's even another way to make this no longer an author issue, and now a user agent -- or even user -- issue. 
Using user style sheets. 
Toss a rule like this into your user style sheet, on modern browser with good CSS2 support: a[target="_new"]:after { content: "(This will open in a new window.)"; 
} Ta da! Problem solved. 
Now all links that will create new windows are identified for you. 
No content generation support? 
Time to get a browser that supports Web standards better. 
:) Okay, just kidding on that, but really, this should be a solved problem by now. 
CSS2 gives us the ability to warn ourselves, and a warning from the author isn't necessary.

Did you see this in the UAAG 1.0 Techniques Document [1]?

On Thu, 8 Aug 2002 13:48:53 -0700 And a new problem created, "_new" is not a valid target name, so there shouldn't be any elements that this applies to.

Is generated content considered part of the element? 
If not, or ambiguous, this may not get read if one is just skipping through the links. 
There's also the problem of people who rely on pictures rather than text. 
No, I wasn't aware that there are user style sheet suggestions in it.

No, but the point Kynn made is that you can do this in your user style sheet and apply it to your browser. 
If people had CSS2 capable browsers as a matter of course (after all, it is only about 5 years since the specification was published as a W3C Recommendation) then we could provide this user style sheet rule and not worry any more about whether the author put it in content. 
Where people are relying on pictures, and getting confused by new windows opening, a different approach is probably smarter - I would suggest the feature that many browsers have of forcing pages to open in the existing window, and keeping the history. 
(iCab does a slightly different thing - you can normally go back in the new window to the page from which you opened it, but not before. 
Opera gives you a more powerful history again as I recall).
