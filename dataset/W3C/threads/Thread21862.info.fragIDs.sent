<s> Hi, I went again trough the whole document and would propose the following changes:  </s>
<s> 1. section 2.1: "Within the framework of this paper, it is natural to think of this as a named graph containing a single triple, blurring the distinction between a (semantic) statement and a (syntactic) triple."  </s>
<s> I think this section is important, thus could be a little bit more precise here.  </s>
<s> Is it appropriate to blur the distinction?  </s>
<s> What are the consequences?  </s>
<s> 2. section 3: "This serialization of named graphs has some disadvantages:" RDF/XML is actually no serialization of Named Graphs, because you cannot serialize a triple where the subject is a literal with RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> Thus we could write: "Using RDF/XML has some disadvantages:" Also delete "Any particular information provider can only use certain URIs as names, specifically URLs from those Web servers on which they can publish." because with xml:base he can use any URI for naming.  </s>
<s> 3. section 5.1: "Since acts are rather transient things to pin down, we will identify the act by a certain concordance between the agent publishing a graph and the content of the graph itself.  </s>
<s> Strictly, the act is the actual publication event, but we will instead use the graph which results from the act as the bearer of the appropriate meaning."  </s>
<s> The relation between graph and agent is too restrictive.  </s>
<s> If I also assert a graph which has already been asserted by somebody else, I do a webAct, but without publishing "the" graph.  </s>
<s> I'm just publishing a graph containing a warrant, which refers to "the" graph.  </s>
<s> 4. section 5.2: ":G1 { :Monica ex:name "Monica Murphy" .  </s>
<s> :G1 swp:assertedBy :G1 .  </s>
<s> :G1 rdf:type swp:Warrant .  </s>
<s> :G1 swp:authority _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a rdf:type swp:Authority .  </s>
<s> _:a foaf:mbox mailto:chris@bizer.de  </s>
<s> }" :G1 swp:assertedBy :G1 .  </s>
<s> :G1 rdf:type swp:Warrant .  </s>
<s> :G1 swp:authority _:a . is wrong !!! Who changed this?  </s>
<s> It must be: :G1 swp:assertedBy _:w2 .  </s>
<s> _:w2 rdf:type swp:Warrant .  </s>
<s> _:w2 swp:authority _:a .  </s>
<s> or _:w1 and change the bnode in the second example to _:w2.  </s>
<s> Also delete "of a blank node, but".  </s>
<s> 5. section 5.3: "The URL used by the publisher needs to be understood by the information consumer, so only a few well-known variations could be used."  </s>
<s> Change "could" in "should".  </s>
<s> 6. section 5.4 example query: "( ?s  </s>
<s> swp:x509Certificate ?certificate  </s>
<s> )" should be changed into "( ?s  </s>
<s> swp:certificate ?certificate  </s>
<s> )" because we have updated the vocabulary in the meantime.  </s>
<s> It would also be nice if we could: 1. Decide that "Named Graphs" is a name and thus write it in capital letters through the whole document.  </s>
<s> Right now small and capital letters are mixed.  </s>
<s> 2. Describe the application areas in chapter 1 in little bit more detail and check the punctuation in the list.  </s>
<s> 3. reorder the bnode ids in the first example in section 5.3.  </s>
<s> to w1, w2, w3 instead of w, w2,w1.  </s>
<s> 4. section 5.4: The nearly identical sentence "The information consumer needs to decide which graphs to accept."  </s>
<s> appears twice in the first and second paragraph.  </s>
<s> 5. in section 6: remove some of the x509 references: [33, 21, 22], I think three are too many.  </s>

<s> These changes/suggestions all sound fine to me.  </s>

<s> Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com  </s>
<s> No action taken - lack of space to expand - no suggested text.  </s>
<s> Done  </s>
<s> Text has been changed completely please review.  </s>
<s> Ditto - new version also uses URIs for some warrant graphs but in a more constrained and better articulated fashion.  </s>
<s> Done  </s>
<s> Done  </s>
<s> Will do  </s>
<s> No action, no space, no suggested words.  </s>
<s> Done, except w2 became a URI to make it a warrant graph.  </s>
<s> Modified  </s>
<s> Deleted one  </s>
