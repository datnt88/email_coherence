There are some misconceptions being perpetuated about the Olympics.com 
case that really need to be clarified for this discussion to be meaningful. 
In Summary: It is grossly inaccurate to suggest that the inaccessibility of Olympics.com as simply a design mistake that couldn't be corrected in time. 
The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games were found, under Australian law, to have acted in an unlawful and discriminatory manner -- not just for not correcting the problems when a complaint was first made, but for attempting to delay the case until they could claim that compliance would be an "unjustifiable hardship". 
The full text of the HREOC decision in the case explicitly clarifies at least some of the misconceptions: The most misquoted aspect is the 1 year / $2 million thing. 
Here are the actual references to evidence given by SOCOG, as presented (in summary form) in HREOC's findings: "* One person working 8 hour business days would require 368 days to complete the task properly." 
"* $2.2 million of additional infrastructure would be required to separately host the additional designs necessary to an accessible Table of Results." 
So saying "it would take a year", as many in the media have misrepresented, is totally inaccurate. 
Based on these numbers, a team of thirty could have accomplished the task in the 17 days between the decision and the start of the Olympics. 
Or, if IBM had mobilised all 2000 of the paid staff they reportedly have on the project, it would have taken 90 minutes. 
The "$2.2 million of additional infrastructure" is less than 5% of the reported $50 million budget of the project (figures in Australian dollars). 
They're clearly not giving this figure as the total cost of making the site accessible -- it's given as the cost of additional equipment to host the site. 
Note that neither IBM nor SOCOG sent staff to the HREOC hearing to testify or give supporting evidence for these figures. 
The figures were presented by consultants brought in only a few days before the hearing, and who had no working knowledge of the website or the preparations for it. 
Note also that IBM were not respondents in this complaint, only SOCOG (Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games). 
The Honourable William Carter QC goes to great lengths in his findings to detail the tactics used by SOCOG to delay the case (the original complaint was lodged with HREOC in June 1999). 
Carter also asserts that the efforts required to make the site accessible would not have been considered "unjustifiable hardship" under the Disability Discrimination Act when the complaint was first made, and that SOCOG's attempt to delay the case until it was too late did not make it so. 
He also explicitly leaves the complaint open to consider a future damages claim. 
I hope this goes some way to clarifying some of the misconceptions regarding this case. 
Regards, Sean Lindsay Editor@DisabilityTimes.com [DJW:] Software projects don't scale like this (I think is actually the basis of the title of the well known book, The Mythical Man Month). 
There is fixed training and familiarisation time for each person, but, more importantly, you need to be able to divide up the work in a way that each person can do it with minimum interaction with the others. 
Whilst simply adding alt may be a job that can be decomposed well, and therefore an exception, one would probably not hope to get a typical one man year project done in less than about four months using four people.

I was just riffing on SOCOG's unsubstantiated evidence that "one person working 8 hour business days would take 368 days". 
The basic point is that they had the time, they had the staff, and they were trying to show that they didn't. 
There were approximately 325 business days between the lodging of the complaint and the opening of the Olympics. 
So if they'd put 2 of IBM's 2000 project staff on it, they could have spent several months getting trained in accessibility techniques and still got the work done on time. 
Whatever way you cut this, it's not impossible. 
"368 working days" is a nonsense figure, anyway -- if you actually wanted to solve the problem, you wouldn't put one person on it for a year, you'd put a team on it. 
If SOCOG/IBM actually did a proper cost/workload analysis of the problem, why didn't they offer it as evidence in the hearing, instead of offering this seemingly random number? 
I speculate that this number, and the $2 million in infrastructure figure, were invented to make the job seem impossibly difficult. 
"It would take a year and cost $2 million" is a good sound bite to feed to the mythical average Australian who's already sick of the cost of the Olympics. 
Whether or not this is what SOCOG intended, this is how the case is being presented in the media, and it's simply not true. 
This should be an issue for people in this forum. 
If we allow these nonsense figures to become part of the public perception of accessible design, it will be even harder to educate designers (and more importantly, decision-makers) about the true costs and benefits. 
This is also why it's important not to mis-characterise this as "designers who didn't know better". 
In this case there was a very deliberate decision made at the most senior level not to pursue accessible design, but to fight it. 
And, let's not forget, SOCOG *lost*. 
In Australia there is now a legal precedent. 
It's not just about education anymore. 
Sean Lindsay Another aspect of the Olympics.com 
debacle, which seems to have been completely missed in all the media coverage I have read: IBM's Olympics.com infrastructure is also being provided for the Paralympic Games. 
So there is a very real possibility that there will be information and results about Paralympic events for Blind athletes that Blind fans cannot access. 
Surely this must put the final nail in the coffin of the "Gee, we didn't think of it" defence. 
[DJW:] Why are you considering it acceptable for the main olympics to exclude the blind :-). 
There was an article in today's paper about someone variously described as "blind" and with "90% vision loss" qualifying for the main 1500m event.

Surely you can't possibly conclude, from my comments in this forum, that I would consider it acceptable for the Olympics.com 
site to exclude the Blind? 
Do I need to put "SOCOG Sucks" in my signature? 
I was trying to make the point that SOCOG and its contractor IBM were responsible for building an information infrastructure that would serve the Paralympics as well as the Olympics. 
So they knew years ahead of time that they would be providing information on events for Blind athletes. 
Surely no-one can then argue they were ignorant that there would be Blind website visitors as well. 
I sincerely hope that Marla Runyan, the first legally blind athlete to qualify for the Olympics, wins Gold, Gold, Gold. 
I'm sure that some journalist somewhere will make the connection, and run a story on whether Ms Runyan could even read the news of her win on the Olympics.com 
site.
