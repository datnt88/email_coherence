<s> Subject: http digest auth + http 1.1?  </s>
<s> From: Keith Moore moore@cs.utk.edu  </s>
<s> Date: Sun, 25 Aug 1996 22:13:43 PDT Last Thursday, the IESG approved both documents draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-07.txt, .ps  </s>

<s> Is it the intention of the working group that the support for the digest authentication method should be included as part of http 1.1?  </s>
<s> (that is, should compliance with the http 1.1 spec require support for the digest authentication method?) I want to make sure that we provide clear instructions to the RFC Editor which are consistent with the working group's wishes.  </s>
<s> thanks, Keith ------- End of forwarded message -------  </s>
<s> I feel that digest authentication is a `may support' feature, not a `must support' feature for HTTP/1.x applications.  </s>
<s> I feel that compliance with 1.1 must _not_ require support for digest authentication: support for various authentication methods has always been optional in HTTP.  </s>
<s> If support were required, this would greatly increase the requirements on a minimal 1.1 application, which is a bad thing.  </s>
<s> I would like to see it be mandatory.  </s>
<s> Here's why. 1) We would like Digest to supersede Basic.  </s>
<s> 2) As long as there's uncertainty that Digest is widely supported by browsers, servers will of necessity ask for authentication by either.  </s>
<s> (That's assuming they support Digest themselves.) 3) If servers can ask for both kinds of authentication, there's no incentive for browser vendors to support Digest.  </s>
<s> So (I believe) they won't.  </s>
<s> So here's a proposal: if an HTTP/1.1 agent (client or server) supports Basic, it must also support Digest.  </s>
<s> Authentication support remains optional, but it's all or none.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> This sounds right to me as well.  </s>
<s> If you support some authentication, you must support good authentication, but you can also support Basic for obvious historical reasons.  </s>
