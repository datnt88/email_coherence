The NT version of Amaya 5.0 displays nothing for either the built in start page or any URL I specify. 
The status line at the bottom indicates that it is going through the motions of fetching the external URL, although possibly too quickly. 
There is nothing in source view or structure view, either. 
Show parsing errors is disabled. 
NT 4 SP 6a high security. 
I tried a de-install/re-install cycle, and have rebooted since the first failure. 
The only unusual thing I can think of is that the boot drive and NT system drive are different.

Amaya writes its temporary files in a directory called c:\temp (maybe it's in capital letters). 
Maybe this is what's causing you the problems. 
Try the following: - select a directory where you want to store those temporary files (let's say d:\temp) - search the file thot.rc, which is the file where we store user preferences. 
- edit the file and add the following line. 
TMPDIR=d:\temp - save the file and launch Amaya. 
If you don't find the file thot.rc or if your Amaya will be used by people having other accounts on your box, then edit the file win-thot.rc 
so that this choice will be the default one for all users. 
Hope this helps, -jose 
[DJW:] Tried TMPDIR and TEMPDIR in both the Amaya and thot_lib parts with no success.

Dave, 
Does the following directory exists on your stations: c:\temp and can the Amaya application write to it? 
Could you also tell me in which path Amaya is installed? 
Thanks, -jose 
Are you saying that Amaya uses a preset folder name rather than the environment variable TEMP which contains the path to the system temp folder which is even on a different on my machine? 
If so can the Amaya choice be changed?

[DJW:] It does exist and does have Amaya and thot71 sub-directories, but the driver is out of space, so Amaya can't write to it! 
(It's VFAT, so there is no access control.) 
There's just over half a MB of content, all Amaya/Thot, except for one 21kB file. 
Clearing it out causes Amaya to start displaying the home page, but TMPDIR=d:\temp, in the thot.rc 
file, doesn't seem to prevent cached entries being put in c:\temp\amaya. 
[DJW:] d:\program files\amaya\
