I've created a directory structure to hold diffs between versions of the WD's and populated it with the differences between first and second last call and between the 05 Sep 2003 and 2nd last call drafts. 
I intend to refer to these in the last call announcement.

I should also have said that there is a script to produce these This relies on an external htmldiff script.

Brian, is this a generally-available tool you have used to create these?
