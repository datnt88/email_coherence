I am thinking about writing a tutorial to familiarize users with the features of Amaya. 
If I pursue this, I would like to know: * What features should I cover? 
* How should I format it? 
* What has given you the most trouble using Amaya (besides bugs)? 
* What formats should the tutorial be available in? 
Thank you ahead of time for any input. 
Thank you for your response, I will try to address these issues, but I have attempted to answer your problems right here. 
I, for one, would be quite grateful, being an illiterate in designing websites, writing webpages and coding. 
But learning and sensitive to the request of W3C to format personal webwriting the right way. 
Questions I am struggling with right now are: * Why and what is the difference between the possible documentformats The different document formats include HTML, XHTML, XML, PDF, and many others. 
I will probably use an XML based language since it is easy to convert to other XML-based formats. 
* What is a loose DTD A loose DTD includes pieces of HTML that are now deprecated (shouldn't be used). 
* How do you use Amaya with a prescribed DTD, or CSS What exactly do you mean by prescribed DTD, or CSS? * Can Amaya be the editor in something like Frontpage (I tried this but the programme got stuck) I highly doubt it, but I am not a developer so you might ask one of them. 
Besides, I don't think Microsoft would like it. 
* I will make a list of explained codes to consult myself, what is p, what is block, what href, etc. Strange, every programmemanual I read does not have this, one has to buy or borrow a book. 
p is paragraph. 
In HTML, the p element is used to markup where a paragraph begins and ends. 
A block starts on a new line, while inline elements are, well, inline. 
div is a block element, while span is an inline element. 
href is an attribute used to give a hypertext reference. 
This is most used in anchors and links. 
Forgive me if the above is stupid, but you asked. 
No question is ever stupid. 
Asking questions is how you learn. 
Don't put yourself down for asking questions or let others put you down for doing so. 
In article 3CD33E1E.3030002@cherokeescouting.org , Mmmmm! Thinks! 
Seriously, What about writing a Schema for Tut-ML and then xslt's for HTML, xhtml, PDF, TeX(?). etc - then tutorials can be written for many kinds of software - particularly that produced by W3C of course - I think in particular of the XML Schema Part 0. Just thought! 
Keith Hopper City Desk Waikato University [PGP key available if desired] Hi Brant, I think this is a great idea. 
I would be inclined to include it as a supplement to the user manual. 
Are you aware of the (pretty basic) attempt at some tutorial stuff I did that was in the documentation until the rewrite? 
(I think it is still in CVS). 
I would suggest that you do this in HTML.

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) My 2 cents: For the features: who is the target of your tutorial? 
- Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to Amaya? 
cover the amaya interface and the results - Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to HTML? cover the html basics and how to use them - Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to XML? cover html and xml basics and compare them to show differences. 
- Is it an experienced html/xml writer who moves to Amaya? 
cover the amaya features and show what happens in the code. 
In general, I prefer to point users to strictly separate the document from it's style: In the document use only the available html codes, put al the style in a stylesheet. 
Specially for professionals: one corporate stylesheet for the basic layout and optionally cascaded stylesheets for tech-documentation and other dedicated usage. 
For the format: use the Amaya make-book featrue as with the amaya manual. 
My troubles with amaya is where to find the features. 
It does not conform to any other tool I use so I frequently browse the menus in search for features. 
BTW: Do NOT make your tutorial a walk trough the featrues! 
Better make some short tutorials to create several dedicate pages. 
Start with a "hello World" page and show what it does. 
Then define several types of documents. 
End with a tutorial on how you created your tutorial, including the cascaded style sheets and other fancy stuff. 
I think you document sould be available in multy page html as the amaya manual is. 
Using amaya, every user can create a single page html (Special- MakeBook). 
With any browser, every user can create their required format, hence do not bother to create postscript, pdf or any other propriatry format. 
CBee * Can Amaya be the editor in something like Frontpage (I tried this but the programme got stuck) No, it's very easy to use another editor within FrontPage, just go to Tools  Options  Configure Editors FrontPage will not alter any source code. 
However, to avoid version conflicts and allow working on server-based webs, FrontPage passes temporary copies to external editors, not the original files. 
Thus, saving the file in Amaya (or any other editor other than frontpg.exe) 
doesn't affect the original file. 
FrontPage won't update it until you close Amaya.
