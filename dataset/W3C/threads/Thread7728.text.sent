Re: Relative references As an server implementer, I prefer that we stick to absolute, but if we do decide to support relative, let's consider if we want to make an exception for "..". 
OK, how come? 
Why's that? 
One problem with the current idea of relative references: the notes say, "If reftarget is relative, the client has the burden of figuring out the value of the absolute URL.". 
This sounds fine--clients already have code for relative URLs--but it won't work, because a 302's Location: header is required to provide an absolute URI (see RFC-2068, section 14.30). 
(Plus, of course, it doesn't work at all for direct references.) I'd say that the Right Thing to do for expanding relative references is to base them off of the Request-URI of the request you're currently processing. 
This shouldn't be too hard: for the spec, point to RFC-1808 (with a note that the "base document" is the reference itself); for the implementation, lift some code from lynx or Mozilla or something.

-- John Kirch| Right, the server must handle the relative to absolute conversion. 
Most servers already do this for config or cgi-based redirects. 
That would be RFC 2396.
