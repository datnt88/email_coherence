I have a problem with one of your remarks: onloy detect errors that do not require human judgement. 
More often than not these are related to visual impairments, but these can be applicable to other disabilities, like LD. The thing Bobby checks for are based on the working draft of the Page Author Guidelines developed by the Web Access Initiative (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) 
The number of LD people who are aided by hearing the text of the web read to them exclusive of any graphical content is a very small percentage of the LD population - and even in this tiny percentage, the graphics are important to context. 
These people, more than others, NEED the graphics to explain the content of the text, and yet comments like above give the impression that LD folks can be accomodated by avoiding or ommitting the graphics. 
This isn't the case. 
I've read the working draft of the Guidelines and found no mention whatsoever of accomodations for those who depend on graphics to interpret text... 
The guidelines give a false sense of accomodations by focusing on avoiding graphics and other page organizers (like frames). 
I got the sense from reading the guidelines that a page of text unrelieved with graphics would be considered "accomdating" when in fact it isn't to many/most LD folks, mentally challenged folks, and poor readers. 
This is a fairly new topic for me, brought about by observing the difficulties of the LD folks I know and love to access information from the web. 
I was told recently, that LD's don't "deserve" accomodations, because they aren't/haven't worked for them as much as the visually impaired have. 
I sincerely hope that that was a gratuitous remark that doesn't reflect the the feelings of everyone else involved in accomodations.

----- End of forwarded message from Anne Pemberton ----- First, what is LD? Second, (I hope I'm not just repeating what Anne said) there are communities who rely on graphic information, or find it easier to digest. 
One of these is the deaf community, who to all intents have their own languages. 
Auslan, the Australian signing language and presumably other sign languages) has its own syntax, so that written English (to stick with the Australian example) is a foreign language albeit one which many deaf people have had to learn from a young age. 
For these people, graphic information is often much easier. 
For many people with no obvious disability this is also the case. 
The web has been so well-received in part precisely because it does allow graphic communication. 
There is certainly a danger that WAI is perceived as 'anti-graphics'. 
This is likely to be due in part ot the fact that people involved (I know this applies to myself and Jason White) have little use for graphics - Jason because he doesn't see them, myself because I find they are often not very helpful and they are difficult to deal with (my employer, a major university, as the mission statement says, provides remote access as text-only). 
One of the things that is implicit in the guidelines, but is not explicit and perhaps should be, is that the purpose is not to remove the graphics. 
The purpose is to alert people to mechanism which need to be used in conjunction with graphics (scripts, applets, etc) to provide the same functionality to non-graphic devices. 
If the web were primarily used to send sound (as the telephone is) then we would be writing guidelines which required ALT and transcripts for the sounds. 
Comments like Anne's are important to remind us of this, and have been taken on board at various stages. 
Another example is the incorporation of guidelines which deal with colour-blindness, an issue which was only raised (as far as I know) very recently in the GL group. 
Perhaps a preamble is required, or an addition to the abstract: These guidelines outline the procedures which should be followed by authors using multimedia content (anything other than text) to ensure that the content and functions provided by those elements are available to all users. 
In general, authors should not be discouraged from using those features, but rather should use them in a manner which ensures that the material they publish is accessible to the widest possible audience. 
(or something of that sort) Charles McCN I think the focus should be an "multi-modal redundancy" a term a professor here at UIUC coined when I was talking to him. 
I don't think this is necessarily a good term, but I think the guidelines should address the ability of the information to be translatable to the form needed by the user.

The issue Charles raises in his suggested preamble is key to the wide acceptance of the guidelines. 
And, as Anne pointed out, a perception that we are "deprecating" graphics could even lead to further access problems for groups of people who want/need them. 
I know that is not our intent. 
I remember that some guidelines (perhaps captured in the original "Universal Guideline" document) specifically tried to address the idea of using "concrete" or "easily understood" images to aid the Learning Disabled (as well as the non-literate) population. 
I also know that the idea of "easily understood" images is a thorny one, not the least because of cultural differences across the total web-population. 
(Another issue being the singular lack of competent and/or sensitive artists designing for the web -- how many of us think that because we have Corel Draw or some Web-graphic package that we know how to design "good" images?) I realize that I am not suggesting a solution here. 
Perhaps I am just restating the problem. 
I second Gregg's request to Anne (and anyone else) who can find the right words for this.
