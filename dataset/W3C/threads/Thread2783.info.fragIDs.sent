In http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1998q2/0031.html and subsequent messages, the question was raised of how the server should calculate the various digests if qop=auth or qop=auth-int was sent by the client, but no cnonce attribute is supplied. 
I propose the following clarification for this; in section 3.2.2 (The Authorization Request Header), append the following to the description of the cnonce: If not present, the null string should be used for this value in any digest calculation where 'cnonce' is used. 
and add the following text to the end of 4.3 (Limited Use Nonce Values): The client generated 'cnonce' value is optional; however, clients choosing not to use this mechanism or which do not change the cnonce value used cannot authenticate the server, and do not have any message integrity protection for responses.

I think that absence of cnonce should be illegal if qop=auth or qop=auth-int is selected by the client; if the client really _demands_ to be totally braindead, it can send a constant as its cnonce. 
I'm also happy with that solution.

Just what does "illegal" mean? 
What should a server do if it gets such an "illegal" request?

I prefer this also.

Send back 400 Bad Request, just like with all ill-formed requests. 
Dave -- it would help if you'd indicate when your questions are Socratic -- I know you've been doing this long enough you know the answers. 
In truth, it was not intended as a Socratic question, and I really wasn't sure whether 400 Bad Request was the intended response. 
I think the spec. 
should be clear about what the server should do, rather than be coy about it.
