<s> (As an historian, an important part of my expertise is looking at documents and determining what the dependencies are.  </s>
<s> It was an interesting exercise in this case.) Although I doubt that any one member of the group has sufficient expertise to create this information from nothing, I think the required expertise and the necessary background information are in fact readily available within working group.  </s>
<s> Part of that expertise is an understanding of what information a developer needs, and how best to present it.  </s>
<s> Your (Bruce's) expertise in that particular area is an important ingredient.  </s>
<s> I haven't come up with this information because I am some kind of genius.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints as I have proposed are those which seem, after discussion and reflection, to provide the necessary information for what must be done.  </s>
