<s> Hello, I am new on this list so I hope it is the right place to ask.  </s>
<s> I am formationg xml files with JTidy.  </s>
<s> I have 2 questions to the result of the format.  </s>
<s> Here is a example output: xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema" targetNamespace="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0"  </s>
<s> xmlns="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0"  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> - Why are some elements divided with blank lines?  </s>
<s> Other parts of the output have no blank lines.  </s>
<s> - When elements are wrapped, can the folowing lines (attributes in the first 3 lines) be indented?  </s>
<s> I know the option for a linebreak for each attribute.  </s>
<s> But I am searching for a possibility to have more than one attribute in one line.  </s>
<s> Thanks Martin  </s>
<s> Boy, I just checked in a fix to that "feature request" for C Tidy yesterday!  </s>
<s> Anyway, it was fresh in my mind, so here is a diff to the Java that will do the same thing.  </s>
<s> It will print instead of take it easy, Charlie  </s>
