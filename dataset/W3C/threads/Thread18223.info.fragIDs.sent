<s> Hello, In the Candidate Rec of the UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 6.2 reads: "Conform to W3C specifications when they are appropriate for a task.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]." The WG has already resolved [2] to change the wording to: "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are available and appropriate for a task."  </s>
<s> I propose changing "specifications" to "Recommendations".  </s>
<s> This would narrow the scope of the requirement.  </s>
<s> It would not prevent user agents from conforming to additional levels of documents, but would only require conformance to Recommendations.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, we should note in the Techs document that developers should pay close attention to Candidate Rec drafts.  </s>
<s> I would like to discuss this at the 9 March meeting.  </s>
<s> Please voice any objections before then.  </s>

<s> I agree with the proposal.  </s>
<s> I would prefer to say in the techniques that developers should pay close attention to working drafts in general, and particularly those that have advanced as far as candidate recommendation.  </s>

<s> aloha, charles!  </s>
<s> consider your agreement seconded... cognizance and monitoring of candidate recommendations, drafts in last call, and working drafts in general should also be stressed in the techniques documents of all of the WAI GLs, especially as they all depend upon the forward-looking WCAG which is, perforce, rife with "until user agent..." clauses... only by monitoring the evolution of technical reports (and following up by reading associated notes), will developers be able to erase those words from WCAG... gregory  </s>

<s> And take so seriously that they comment on the candidate or proposed recs.  </s>
<s> Of course, this conformance implies some time lag to get into product upgrade cycles (and their testing/debugging/reissuing.)  </s>
<s> I agree: Specifications to me have the presumption of standards agencies, and glacially slow evolution, while international concurrence is obtained.  </s>
<s> These are Technical Recommendations.  </s>
