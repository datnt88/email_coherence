<s> See Gregg's latest summary to the list at 2. Guideline 5. Issues related to guideline 5 arose at last week's meeting; thus it seems best to address them directly.  </s>
<s> Note that Cynthia's proposed reworking of guideline 5 is included in the latest internal working draft.  </s>

<s> my comments are: 1, I like Kynns modular approach much better.  </s>

<s> If these aren't done - most everyone in a major  </s>
<s> disability group can't access the information.  </s>
<s> (e.g. no captions)" Please note the largest disabilities groups are thoughs with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> There needs must be addressed as P1 or equivalent.  </s>
<s> 3. Minimal conformance to a guideline may require some testability.  </s>
<s> That does  </s>
<s> not mean that checkpoints without testability need to be demoted for prioritization levels as well.  </s>
<s> I have a conflicting meeting, so I will be late.  </s>

<s> Sorry you cannot make it Couple of questions then to clarify. 1 - you said you liked modular approach better - so we didn't discriminate.  </s>
<s> As I understood modular approach - it meant that people could pick which checkpoints to include or exclude.  </s>
<s> Current proposal is to require that all checkpoints be included at least at minimum level.  </s>
<s> I thought the current proposal sounded better for your concern.  </s>
<s> Please expand your thought because I'm missing something. 2 - Yes - cognitive is perhaps the largest group depending on how it is defined.  </s>
<s> The comment wasn't about the relative sizes of disability groups though.  </s>
<s> (One of our consensus items was that conformance should not be able to be disability specific --- so relative sizes or visibility or anything else of major disability groups did not arise.  </s>
<s> ) The item was about how universally needed something was within a major disability group.  </s>
<s> 3 - Correct.  </s>
<s> Testability did not demote success criteria to lower levels under the current consensus of the group.  </s>
<s> Success criteria needed to be testable at all levels - unless we change our minds.  </s>
<s> PS I too think we want to get to machine readable and understandable text as a goal for better access.  </s>
<s> I think it is the best chance for getting access to text at all the different cognitive and language levels that might be needed - and for agent assisted access as well.  </s>
<s> How to do it will indeed be a long topic.  </s>
<s> Thanks for starting up the discussion.  </s>
<s> As Co-chair I also thank you for thinking to take it off list since it will be a big topic.  </s>
<s> And put me on the list.  </s>
