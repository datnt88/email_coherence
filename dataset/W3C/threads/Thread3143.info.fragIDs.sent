This looks a useful summary of where we are. 
Thanks. 
(A pity though that it is in pale grey type - I had to use the accessibility option to "ignore colors specified on Web pages" to make it easily legible.) I haven't followed up all the links, but was a bit puzzled by the distinction between "preferred-label" and "descriptor" in SKOS-Core. 
They seem to me to be the same thing. 
I take it that any labels that are not "preferred-labels" are by default "non-preferred labels" or "nondescriptors", so that is the reason why these are not explicitly provided for. 
You have preferred-label Use this property to indicate a literal which is the preferred label for a resource. 
If a resource has this property, all other rdfs:label properties are considered to be the 'alternative' (i.e. non-preferred) labels. 
and descriptor A 'descriptor' is a label that uniquely identifies a concept within a conceptual scheme. 
A descriptor must be unambiguous. 
Examples of good descriptors are 'Orange (fruit)' and 'Java programming language'. 
Examples of poor descriptors are 'Orange' and 'Java'. 
Is there any significance in the fact that the first definition refers to "a resource" while the second refers to "a concept"? 
In http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/deliverables/8.1.html#2.2 we read: (a) The soks:prefLabel property is a sub-property of rdfs:label. 
(b) The soks:descriptor proeprty [sic.] is a sub-property of soks:prefLabel. 
Therefore a concept cannot have both a descriptor and a prefLabel. 
I can see no place for a preferred label that is not a descriptor. 
If the "Therefore . 
. 
." statement in (b) is a consequence of the first sentence of (b), would there not be a parallel conclusion in (a) : "Therefore a concept cannot have both a prefLabel and a label". 
Such a conclusion seems incorrect.

Sorry to follow up my own message, but on re-reading it I realised that this sentence might be ambiguous. 
I didn't mean that a place should be provided, but rather: "I see no need to define a category of preferred label that is not a descriptor" Leonard Willpower Information (Partners: Dr Leonard D Will, Sheena E Will) L.Will@Willpowerinfo.co.uk Sheena.Will@Willpowerinfo.co.uk ---------------- URL:http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/ -----------------
