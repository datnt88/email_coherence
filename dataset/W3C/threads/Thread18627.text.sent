Firstly, I must correct an error which was made in my previous message regarding dictionaries. 
Contrary to what I therein suggested, it is possible to have a general link type (rel="dictionary") and still ensure that a dictionary which is intended to control a speech synthesizer is only loaded by speech-based user agents: The user agent can then retrieve the dictionary and determine from the file format, which is yet to be defined, whether it contains phonetic data or abbreviations and their expansions. 
Now I would like to turn to the second issue, namely a possible ambiguity in the definition of the default media type. 
This working group has proposed, and the HTML/CSS working groups have accepted, that "screen" should be the default media type. 
This default gives a correct result when the target of the link is a style sheet: This refers to a CSS style sheet which, owing to the default media type of "screen", will be retrieved by the user agent and acted upon only if output is being directed to a screen display. 
However, in the section of the HTML 4.0 draft devoted to the LINK element, there are various other link types defined, for which a default media type of "screen" would be inappropriate. 
Thus: In this case, the default media type of "screen" should not be implied; the link to the table of contents is capable of being rendered in any medium. 
For example, a speech-based user agent might announce the title defined in the LINK element prior to rendering the text of the document. 
Thus, media="screen" should only be the default where rel="stylesheet" or rel="alternate stylesheet" Is this correct, or am I falling into error and confusion again? 
It's not clear to me that the 'media' rather than the 'class' attribute is better suited for that. 
As defined, the media range is not sufficient to convey all kind of dictionary types. 
Maybe these two are orthogonal in fact. 
Not at all, I think this is implied by the way the spec is organized (media types being defined in the SS section only) but this is worth the precision. 
The default media in the other case should probably be defined as "current". 
I agree, and also think that clarification of this issue in the spec is necessary. 
In the published draft, as part of the exposition of the LINK element, there is already an example similar to the following: which shows that MEDIA is of general application and not confined merely to style sheets. 
The use of CLASS to indicate the type of dictionary would be more precise than relying on the MEDIA attribute: provided that separate classes are defined so that the user agent can decide whether to load the dictionary or not in any given instance. 
However, what is the advantage of this strategy as compared with defining separate link types for each kind of dictionary? 
An abbreviation dictionary can be used not only by a speech synthesizer, but also as a means of establishing hypertext links between every occurrence of an abbreviation and its expansion. 
Thus, we should define different types of dictionaries rather than relying on the media attribute. 
The question which remains is thus whether CLASS or REL should carry the designation of the dictionary type.
