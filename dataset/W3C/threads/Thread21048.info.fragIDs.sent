<s> Hello, Amaya (7.1 running on Windows 2000) has a gray background making the foreground text difficult to read.  </s>
<s> I saw a copy of a similar note less than a month ago and would like to know what the solution is.  </s>
<s> A white background would be wonderful.  </s>
<s> Am I just missing something obvious?  </s>
<s> I note that the help functions, such as the index, flash gray as they are activated but then stabilize with a white background for me.  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>

<s> I solved the problem by giving all of my documents a standard stylesheet with the following information for the body: BODY { font-family: Times, serif ; color: #000000 ; background-color: #ffffff } That gives you a black Times or serif font on a white background.  </s>
<s> You can do it either by creating a separate stylesheet (which is what I did) or by opening the source window and entering it in the header, using standard style markup.  </s>
<s> The stylesheet was easier for me.  </s>
<s> For documents you're viewing off the web, I really don't have any idea what to do.  </s>
<s> For some unknown reason, gray has been the default ever since Mosaic.  </s>

<s> If you put this into your user stylesheet (called amaya.css in the directory where local info is stored - ~/.amaya on Unix, and I don't know where in Windows) then it will be applied to all documents, although overridden by anything with its own stylesheet.  </s>
<s> You do need to remember that documents you are editing don't have a stylesheet applied to them except for your own use, so you might need to add the rules into a stylesheet explicitly linked.  </s>
<s> I think the Amaya style interface is due for an overhaul, but I don't know the details about when that might happen.  </s>
<s> (I also think it is still about the best styling interface I have seen, although the options it presents are limited and not all good ones) Cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> Menu "Special" = Preferences = Colors There it is, the "Color Preferences" dialog.  </s>
<s> To the developers and users: This dialog is rather tricky (it has usability issues).  </s>
<s> Scenario: you want to change the background color.  </s>
<s> You select the value under "Document background color", click "Use palette", click in a bright yellow and then "Done" (BTW these palettes must dimiss with Esc).  </s>
<s> Upon returning to the page you notice that you now have bright yellow text over the same background as before.  </s>
<s> You turn back to the "Color Preferences" dialog thinking that you chose the wrong button or tha like, but not: you did it right but the outcome is wrong.  </s>
<s> After a couple times you might notice that the background is changed by clicking THE OTHER BUTTON (as when editing pages).  </s>
<s> Also, this dialog seems to lack a means to cancel changes.  </s>
<s> To the developers: Id' change the beckground color default to the much more usual white.  </s>
<s> Some people might reject a browser that shows it all in a rather dark gray shade.  </s>
<s> I think there is no a safe lighter gray available.  </s>

<s> You can change the default Amaya background in "Special  Preferences  Colors".  </s>
<s> You can also select a color with CSS (see Help  Configuring Amaya) Irene.  </s>
