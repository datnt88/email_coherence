Hi, In reading though the HTTP/1.0 memo with info header HTTP Working Group T. Berners-Lee, MIT/LCS INTERNET-DRAFT R. Fielding, UC Irvine draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-05.html H. Frystyk, MIT/LCS Expires August 19, 1996 February 19, 1996 I'm a bit confused by section 3.2.2 http URL. 
Based on the general syntax presented in section 3.2.1, an http URL can include 'params'. 
[Section 3.2.2 of RFC1738 shows the use of ;type= typecode as intended for ftp URLs. 
Section 3.3 of RFC1738 describing an http URL admits no 'params'.] 
Should section 3.2.2 be modified to the following? 
http_URL = "http:" "//" host [":" port] ["/" [path] ["?" query]]

But RFC1738 (sorry I've got no reference, but my copy of the RFC is in another country right now), does specify that the ';' is a reserved characer in HTTP URLs, presumably to allow for future extensions, like params. 
I hope not, because I'm about to propose a "version" parameter to allow access to back revisions of a page stored in a version control system like RCS or SCCS.

I hope nobody intends to make such a proposal until after the 1.1 draft is submitted... 
... in any case I think there might be somewhat more of a problem with versions than one might think at first glance. 
Having built a server on top of CMS a couple of years ago I don't think that there is a comprehensive version naming strategy avaliable. 
I think that it may be a more profitable approach to look at versioning in terms of annotations and link semantics and not in terms of URLs. 
After all we may well have an MD5 URN someday [I already have a protocol for resolving these]. 
There would be little opportunity to make an MD5 URN work with versioning... 
Anyway, enough said... we can return to this in May.

Why? The syntax for HTTP URLs hasn't changed between 1.0 and 1.1, so there's no dependence on the version of HTTP. 
I don't expect to document semantics of version names. 
As long as there are no colons in the version name, then my proposal should manage. 
Even then, escaping colons, or using &amp;#xx; would work. 
We already have a prototype working as a server extension for the Netscape and MS servers. 
Annotations and link semantics might also be appropriate. 
After talking to Ari about how to present the idea, in light of his experience with the byte-range proposal, I figured that URLs are a good start, because the have the advantaqge that the users can enter them directly to fetch a particular revision.
