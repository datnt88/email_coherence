<s> No. It was discussed at the meeting on Sunday morning and decided that we would include a single guideline on making the tool accessible, and that the techniques for that guideline/checkpoints would aim to provide a complete checklist of user interface accessibility requirements.  </s>
<s> This makes good sense to me - it is better than finding that developers on some platform have been referred to guidelines which miss something important, although they are in a set of guidelines which are in other guidelines for different platforms or systems.  </s>

<s> No, because in order to make our document we have to know what specific parts of accessibility guidelines aren't covered by the existing documents but apply only to authoring tools.  </s>
<s> Also, in the Sunday meeting we decided to include a short synopsis of general accessibility practices as list items in our document for completeness' sake.  </s>
<s> (The compelling argument is "it's okay to say that we will refer to other documents, but what if someone writes guidelines for linux (e.g.) that're incomplete -- it doesn't mention keyboard accessibility (e.g.) -- at least we will have the concept presented in ours.)  </s>
<s> Also, the UA guidelines are still a work in progress; we can't really refer to them without having to continually (as a group) track whatever they do.  </s>
<s> This is the problem that LOTS of WAI groups have faced with the WCAG, having to change their own approach as the content WG changes theirs.  </s>
<s> So I would say, no, the "(instead)" part is not correct.  </s>

<s> This (expanding the platform guidelines in AU) doesn't make sense to me.  </s>
<s> We're going to end up with either: - duplicate information in both AU and UA - circular dependency betwen AU and UA What would make sense would be have the "Make the authoring tool accessible" checkpoint moved in UA altogether, on the ground that UA is not just browsing but also editing.  </s>
<s> It looks like we will end up with duplicate information, when Ian and I complete our action items from the last call.  </s>
<s> This is not necessarily a bad thing, since it is at the techniques level anyway.  </s>
