From check-character-normalization "check-character-normalization" true [optional] Check if the characters in the document are fully normalized, as defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1]. 
What actions should be expected if a character in the document is not fully normalized? 
I'd assume that an error should be dispatched, but the spec doesn't say. 
What should be the behavior if both check-character-normalization and normalize-characters are specified as true? 
Are there any interaction between the parameters? 
It might make sense that setting one unsets the other. 
As far as I am aware there are no implementations supporting either of these parameter being true. 
Curt Arnold scripsit: The processor should make that fact available to the application by some means or other. 
XML 1.1 is rather new, y'know.

LS specifies a 'check-character-normalization-failure' DOMError. 
Perhaps this ought to be in Core, though given the resolution of LSSerializer-iucd-issue it probably won't be. pxdom supports both, but only on Python 2.3; earlier versions of the unicodedata module do not provide character normalisation. 
Andrew Clover Sorry I missed it since I've been trying to finish up the L3 Core suite at the expense of all the other modules. 
I would appreciate any feedback on the L3 Core tests added yesterday. 
You're touching here an area that is under specified in XML: the XML error catalog. 
Core and Load/Save do provide some of the errors/warnings types that can be generated but we are clearly missing a lot of them. 
I don't think we followed a particular logic on when to define one or not, and it is not the role of the DOM WG to define the error catalog imho. 
We may want to define if it's a warning, or an error at least. 
I'd expect the implementations to check and normalize the characters (doing it in reverse order would be useless). 
Now whether it's going to generate one or two DOMErrors given that both parameters are activated is not defined in the specification. 
Why? normalize-characters doesn't tell you if some characters were unnormalized before normalizing them. 
An application might want to report the number of characters that were normalized as well as doing the normalization without invoking normalizeDocument twice.
