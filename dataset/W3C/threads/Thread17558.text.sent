Proposal for UA guidelines: A browser must show rulers and borders. 
A ruler or border can be described in text if "showing" it is not convenient. 
This is specifically a feature that should be added to Text based browsers like LYNX.

Rulers and borders are visual objects that by themselves have no meaning. 
An aural user does not gain anything from knowing that a table has borders (for example). 
Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development When you look at a ruler as such it is _only a visual objet", but a (good) designer adds a ruler for some reason Yes, and so the browser should give the reason for the rule rather than saying "There's a rule". 
In structural HTML, there are no rules, but there are reasons for rules. 
When you look at a today's HTML page you see several types of tables: - Tables to force some layout. 
They normally do not have a border since that would disturb the layout. 
- numerical or textual tables. 
In these case the borders are used to identify the diferent cells and/or rows/comuns. 
The cells are identified by the TD or TH elements. 
The borders are a visual presentation that is unimportant to the non-visual user since they do not express any meaning.

It is not exeactly the border that I need, but the column/row/cell build up even if the table is implemented in nice or straight forward textual format.
