<s> Hello, all - For discussion, here's my second draft redesign of the WAI home page.  </s>
<s> I think I got all the new content, and I used three columns to bring the "tagline," Announcements, and Guidelines and Resources all above the fold.  </s>
<s> I also played a bit with images (the one of T B-L was degraded to start with, so was difficult to work with).  </s>
<s> There were still tweaks I wanted to make, but I've run out of time.  </s>
<s> Shawn, if you post this to the WSTF site, please don't forget the Images folder.  </s>

<s> Please note that the background of the T B-L quote box should be gray, not blue.  </s>
<s> My monitor at work shows this color as grayish, and I did not catch the error until I viewed the page on my home monitor.  </s>
<s> The error is due to a typo in the style that I did not catch in my rush to catch the ferry.  </s>
<s> Shawn, if you post the page to the Web, please change the style color to "background-color:rgb(94% 94% 94%)".  </s>

<s> I think that this site is much more visually appealing then the last draft.  </s>
<s> My only concern is that when I look at the page my eyes are going everywhere.  </s>
<s> I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at.  </s>
<s> I can't tell  </s>
<s> what the main section is that I'm supposed to be reading.  </s>
<s> Plus I would flip Tim Berners-Lee's body so that he is facing into the quote.  </s>
<s> Right now he is like an arrow pulling people's eyes off the page.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Justin Thorp  </s>
<s> Great job Blossom!  </s>
<s> I agree with Justin's statement on flipping the photo - we'd need to get a new version anyway - that one appears very lossy on my screen.  </s>
<s> As for eye-wandering I had a bit of that myself.  </s>
<s> Possibly making some of the vertical DIV's stronger would help.  </s>
<s> Also, the links at the top appear very close together in IE 6 and Opera.  </s>
<s> There's not enough white space between them to make them appear as individual links.  </s>
<s> I don't know that we need the WAI h1 above the content as we've already got the Logo above it.  </s>
<s> I think it just gives us less space for content - any other thoughts?  </s>
<s> Pardon me if we've discussed this.  </s>
<s> It would be great if we could use a dynamic content system that was easy to implement and made 100% accessible pages - does one exist?  </s>
<s> Charmane, you had a post the other day regarding CMS - are there any you would recommend?  </s>
<s> I've been using Movable Type for a blog I'm working, and it appears to be great - as long as you add ALT text to images.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what our policies are on using other technologies though.  </s>
<s> Talk to you tomorrow.  </s>

<s> Hello Blossom, 1. Was wondering if WAI site search form should be on the home page.  </s>
<s> 2. I see that certain sections are listed under guidelines and resources section.  </s>
<s> Should they be h3 level headings like you have for the Highlights? 3. A minor edit: I think Strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web accessible _to_ people with disabilities should be Strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web accessible _for_ people with disabilities Thanks, Sailesh Panchang Senior Accessibility Engineer Deque Systems,11180 Sunrise Valley Drive, 4th Floor, Reston VA 20191 E-mail: sailesh.panchang@deque.com  </s>
