This was asked for ages ago and I drafted it but didn't send it out publically. 
It's in reply to a comment of Chris Lilley who asked why we didn't point to SVG's use of RDF metadata.: ... I request (as an individual commentor) that you do explicitly discuss embedding of RDF within SVG in your document. 
A new section 10 "Using RDF/XML with SVG" would seem appropriate. 
I would be happy to help draft such a section. 
-- Chris Lilley, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2003Mar/0075.html which Brian forwarded in April There is always scope to expand the text below futher however my only real issue is which SVG version(s) to mention. 
Should I mention SVG 1.0 and 1.1 since both are recommendations? 
Dave Intended to go in current editor's draft of the RDF/XML revised as a new section 10 p There is a standardized approach for associating RDF compatible metadata with SVG - the metadata element which was explicitly designed for this purpose as defined in a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/metadata.html" SVG metadata /a in the a href="#ref-svg" [SVG] /a . 
p This document contains two example graphs in SVG with such embedded RDF/XML inside the metadata element: and a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/figure2.svg" figure 2 /a .

Thanks for the positive reply. 
I see that suggested asking me to prepare such a section, but unfortunately did not copy me, so i was unaware of this discussion until today. 
May I assume from todays message that the intention is to add this section 10? DB -- Chris Lilley, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2003Mar/0075.html

Sure, point to 1.1 as well, it says the same as 1.0 does. 
1.0 was where the facility was introduced. 
1.1 merely modularises 1.0. 
The draft text looks good and its inclusion would satisfy my requirements.

Please note that this (at DanC's request) is also covered in the Primer at the end of Section 6.1. 
I'll try to make sure we're consistent here.

Yes, that was my fault - I lost the issue and forgot about the draft. 
Sorry. 
Yes, I've already had the RDF Core WG's goahead for this. 
Will do. 
Great, thanks Dave I've added the RDF/XML with SVG section to the RDF/XML syntax editor's draft as the new section 10 as promised. 
I just added the SVG 1.1 links too Dave
