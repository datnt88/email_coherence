<s> I've just starting working as a member of the Commission on Persons with Disabilities in Alexandria, VA.  </s>
<s> I'm brainstorming about ways that the Commission (and the City) can use WAI to increase accessibility for its citizens.  </s>
<s> I thought a discussion of the topic of grass roots efforts promoting WAI might benefit the whole list.  </s>
<s> To get us started, here's a short list of what I have so far: 1. Official city page advertising its use of WAI guidelines 2. Work with chamber of commerce to promote use of WAI guidelines by businesses with internet (e.g. Create COC Award, make use of WAI guidelines an accreditation standard, etc.) 3. Work with ISPs, Web Designers located in city to promote WAI guidleines.  </s>
<s> Any ideas that would flesh out what I've suggested or, even better, that are entirely new would be great.  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Christopher Marston said:  </s>
<s> Number one, connect with grassroots, consumer-controlled organizations that are people with disabilities in Alexandria find worth belonging to, and work with them.  </s>
<s> We can help you with the "how" once you learn from them "what" your goals should be.  </s>
<s> Is there an economic development office in Alexandria?  </s>
<s> Don't stop with the Chamber of Commerce.  </s>
<s> Alexandria is the capital of the associations industry.  </s>
<s> Team up with the Asociation of Associations to develop and maintain the definitive courseware unit on how Associations can capitalize on the Web.  </s>
<s> Their Internet presence, a coordinated program of Web publishing, accepting questions via email, etc., can make them more effective and less costly to run.  </s>
<s> This is critical.  </s>
<s> The Associations industry as we know it absolutely needs to re-tool to capitalize on digital communications and information technology or it will go elsewhere to people who have figured out how to do that.  </s>
<s> Making information accessible to all is one lesson in this program.  </s>
<s> Associations are an industry where sharing information is the name of the game.  </s>
<s> If we can get the associations industry tooled up with broadly accessible information technology, we can reach anybody.  </s>
<s> One of the products that associations typically deliver to their members is tutorial literature dealing with "compliance" issues.  </s>
<s> The accessibility of Website information is going to be one of those compliance issues that their members need to deal with.  </s>
<s> Association after association is going to need to know about this topic to inform its membership.  </s>
<s> Many of those associations are Alexandria taxpayers.  </s>
<s> Make sure it is easy for the associations to get their customers the straight scoop.  </s>
<s> You don't have to invent this expertise out of whole cloth.  </s>
<s> In Alexandria you also have advocacy resources.  </s>
<s> I believe that the NIB is located there.  </s>
<s> Find your local resources as well as those [associations] who need this information.  </s>
<s> You make the connections, and watch it happen.  </s>

<s> You may want to start off with the disability-related web sites themselves, especially those in your immediate area,-- if it is similar to my experience in the state of Georgia, many of them are not using universal accessibility standards.  </s>
<s> Other suggestions: -- You will need to get the regional education and government web sites on board as well.  </s>
<s> -- As a method, I would really promote http://validator.w3.org/ to webmasters as well as business owners, program directors, etc .  </s>

<s> This site allows you to enter an url address and get feedback as to how well it adheres to HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> You could also use which does a similar service (though I don't know if it is WAI compliant.  </s>
<s> (Comments on 'bobby' anyone)?  </s>
<s> In any event, this gives immediate feedback to the webmaster and their bosses as to how UA their site is.  </s>
<s> Good luck, Wayne P.S. Seeking editorial comment here: Seems to me that WAI and universal accessibility is being addressed at the national and global level quite adequately, but not so well at the region/state/community level.  </s>
<s> Would love feedback on this.  </s>
