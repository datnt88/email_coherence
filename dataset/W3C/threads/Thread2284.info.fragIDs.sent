The latest draft of the cookie spec. is at 
The new version incorporates suggestions and corrections by Jeff Mogul, Ted Hardie, and Koen Holtman, plus some slight rewording concerning "minimum capabilities" prompted by several people. 
You can get versions with change bars from either the I-D (v2.10) or the previously announced draft (v2.16). 
I'll extend the comment period to 2100 GMT, Thursday, April 25. 
(Yes, we're all busy with the HTTP draft.) I believe we're close to convergence anyway.

Mea culpa. 
If you were among the industrious few to (try to) grab the new cookie draft between the time of my announcement and about 1:45 EDT (1745 GMT), you didn't get it. 
I screwed up. 
Please try again: With apologies,

Dave Kristol: 
Only two comments: #4.3.5 Sending Cookies in Unverifiable Transactions Users must have | 
#control over sessions in order to insure privacy. 
Shouldn't this be `assure'? 
#8.2 Cookie Spoofing #Note that a server at cracker.edu could send a cookie to the client and | #subsequently get both of the cookies in the preceding example as well as | #its own. 
I was confused by this, and after re-reading it twice, I think this is wrong. 
I believe this should be: Note that a server called cracker.edu could send a cookie to the client without an explicit domain, and subsequently get the second cookie in the preceding example as well as its own. 
Koen. 
Well, maybe "ensure". 
No. Actually, the whole passage must be dropped. 
I put it in when Ted 
Hardie observed the problem as stated. 
But we've fixed the problem by requiring explicit leading dots in Domain=. 
If a server at cracker.edu sent a cookie to the client, it would only 
get back its own cookie. 
It could only set Domain=cracker.edu, which is also the default Domain. 
(Domain=.cracker.edu 
would not domain-match the host name (cracker.edu), and the cookie would be discarded.) 
Since cookies with domains victim.cracker.edu 
and .cracker.edu do not domain-match "cracker.edu", 
neither cookie in the example would get send to the bad guy.

Dave Kristol: 
:) Actually, `ensure' was the word I was thinking of first, but I could not find it in any on-line dictionary. 
You are right. 
My correction above is also incorrect. 
Koen.
