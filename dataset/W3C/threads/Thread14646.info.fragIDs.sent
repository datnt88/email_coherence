<s> Per my action item from last call here's a first cut at a new guideline: Guideline X. Design for so that testability can most easily be verified.  </s>
<s> Pages should be designed to minimize amount of human effort needed to confirm accessibility.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.1 Specify in machine readable form specifications against which machine verification may be preformed.  </s>
<s> Example: in HTML include the DOCTYPE.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.2 Avoid use of alternative version of content that requires human effort to verify.  </s>
<s> Example: Avoid when possible manually created images of text; use styled text instead.  </s>
<s> Note that automated generation of images of text are allowed per checkpoint x.3 checkpoint x.3 When alternative versions of content are created, create them automatically when possible.  </s>
<s> Example: A program that automatically converts text to images checkpoint x.4 When alternative content is created manually, make specific correspondence between content and its particular alternative.  </s>
<s> Negative Example: A manually created alternative text-only site in which information is distributed differently among ithe pages.  </s>
<s> Validating the equivalence of such a manually created site is very labor intensive.  </s>
<s> Positive Example: Image and ALT text.  </s>
<s> It's simple for a tool to present image and ALT tag to user for comparison (e.g. in A-Prompt and in the Wave) Positive Example: Content provided by Object tag and nested object tag.  </s>
<s> Positive Example: Two sites created from common data through different transformations, PROVIDED that the transformation rules are publically visible for validation.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.5 When possible, Use only styles linked consistently to particular semantic objects.  </s>
<s> Example: CSS rule that makes all Headings a particular style.  </s>
<s> Negative Example: CSS rule linked to class.  </s>
<s> Current CSS has no way to expose class semantics to user agent, so it takes human judgment to decide if the class is simply decorative, which is harmless, or is carrying information unavailable to user agents.  </s>

<s> I find this to be questionable in that it may not be possible in a fully CC/PP-driven, dynamic presentation model.  </s>
<s> In other words, it may be hard for someone who is not using specific  </s>

<s> for someone who _is_, because different presentations are delivered.  </s>
<s> This seems a bit like a meta-issue rather than an actual accessibility issue; it doesn't actually affect the accessibility of the content but rather someone's ability to evaluate that accessibility.  </s>
<s> I am not convinced that those are on the same level of requirement, or even that this -needs- to be included in our guidelines.  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> I think I agree with Kynn - being testable doesn't seem to me to automatically enhance accessibility.  </s>
<s> (But explaining accessibility features  </s>
<s> of the site and how to use them probably does - I'll add that to my list of emails to send...) However, it is a useful feature.  </s>
<s> It may also be an intersting issue for the Authoring Tool Guidelines, at least as a possible extra feature, or a technique that would be nice to have.  </s>

<s> Not sure what "automatically" means but it's hard to see how if the elements of the Web - and our goal is not just accessible sites, but an accessible Web - were not to be testable/evaluationable/findable/usable/+ they would be accessible in the fullest sense.  </s>
<s> Both the indexing and testability features are central to what we're about.  </s>
<s> At least at the P3 level it should be a requirement that one be able to test if a site conforms before trying to access it, else we become enmired in having to post yet another whine to Webwatch or whatever.  </s>
<s> Why should I have to even link to a site that will turn out to be untestable?  </s>
<s> At the moment it doesn't even have to proclaim its conformance status - even if it is Triple-A!  </s>
<s> You can't just be accessible, you must "advertise" that status.  </s>
<s> There was a series of TV commercials with the tough inspector's punch-line "It can't say 'Hanes' until I say it can say 'Hanes'".  </s>
<s> And you must index the site with such features as fragIDs (with appropriate  </s>
<s> summaries) and other semantic revelations.  </s>
<s> We must  </s>
<s> encourage/require/simplify/+ the process of authors conveying what they mean, not just how it's presented.  </s>
<s> A part of this is structure-revelation,  </s>
<s> part is testability for verifications of claims/assertions/proofs/+ of compliance.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> FragID's are good because of the backwards compatability, but I hope that in 5-10 years from now we'll all be using XPath/XPointer to reference stuff.  </s>
<s> It's a primary accessibility feature that you must be able to refer to stuff, otherwise by definition it isn't accessible!  </s>
<s> Like what?  </s>
<s> I feel a quote coming up: "If you write what you mean rather than what you want done with it, then it can be repurposed so much better."  </s>
<s> This is in line with what Kynn was talking about, that if you have a source that says what you mean, you can then apply what you want done with it: presentation(content).  </s>
<s> Brilliant!  </s>
<s> Roll on CC/PP / XHTML 2.0.  </s>
<s> If these go to rec.  </s>
<s> before WCAG 2.0 (howver unlikely), won't that make the Techniques documents staggeringly difficult?  </s>
<s> Also, I wonder what mention should be made of XHTML Basic?  </s>
<s> We should be pushing for accessibility of information to all Web users...but if that means providing thousands of types of alternative content, people aren't going to do it.  </s>
