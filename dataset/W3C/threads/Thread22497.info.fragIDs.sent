<s> For those who may be interested, I have added tutorials on the W3 and IE5 DOM's for HTML and XML to my web pages (www.hypermedic.com/style/index.htm).  </s>
<s> Follow the DOM link.  </s>
<s> I am aware that there will probably be revisions to both these DOM's in the near future, so the tutorials are only available as a text file (55K, no  </s>
<s> illustrations)or a Word6 file (255K) at the present time.  </s>
<s> I decided to go  </s>
<s> ahead and post them anyway as I understand the changes will not be of a major nature.  </s>
<s> Also I have been promising to post them for 4 months now!  </s>
<s> When the DOM situation stabalizes, I will revise them and convert the files to HTML.  </s>

<s> P.S: Your Word file size is not 255K but 2.87M or 2870K !!! ;)  </s>
<s> Ouch!!!! Thanks for the correction!!  </s>
<s> The Word 97 file is only 255K, I can't beliieve how the conversion to Word6 made it so huge!!!! And to think I converted it to make it more accessible.  </s>
<s> I am going to post a Word97 version right away (which incidently looks much better).  </s>

<s> i thought we were doing XML not word or rtf (which by the way usually is the reason why your "word6 converted" file is blown up: "save as [word 6]" is a "save as [rtf]" if you didn't install a "bug fix" - oh sorry - "service pack" )  </s>
