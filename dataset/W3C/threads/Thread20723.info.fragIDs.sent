When parsing an SVG document that includes a metadata element, if that element has a namespace that is not supported by Amaya (e.g. RDF) it stops parsing. 
Example file: http://jigteam.w3.org/2001/08/imagePictures/001.svg 
This is blocking some work I am trying to do on accessibility, and is anyway an important SVG accessibility feature. 
I think that the spec allows the browser to just ignore the children of the metadata element and still conform.

You're right. 
We'll try to do that as soon as possible. 
Cool - thanks.
