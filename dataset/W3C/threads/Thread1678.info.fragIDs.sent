<s> We've been trying to get it published as an RFC.  </s>
<s> So far, there has been support within the IESG for making it an Experimental, but that would make it a no-no to reference in standards-track documents.  </s>
<s> Since there are a number of things that would like to use it and go to standards-track, we are trying to get that changed.  </s>
<s> My own personal take on the situation is that there is resistance to anything that encourages more protocols to extend or layer on HTTP because that is viewed as a problem.  </s>
<s> In some ways, I actually share this view, but I also think that since it will happen anyway we should at least provide some guidance on the less-bad ways to do it.  </s>
<s> [in the interest of reducing duplicates, and because this is about the status and not the protocol, I've directed replies only to discuss@apps.ietf.org]  </s>

<s> One data point: I asked Keith Moore about the status at WWW8 (May this year), he told me that they were thinking about it, but it did not sound like anything would happen soon.  </s>
<s> I guess I should mention here that I am one of the main proponents of making it experimental only, at least until we have more experience etc, and I have told the IESG so.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that using the -ext- framework is superior to just defining some new methods/headers.  </s>

<s> Maybe all APPS standards should have experimental, or an equivalent, as a necessary first step in getting to standards track proposed.  </s>
<s> I've wondered about this - maybe groups should have to publish as Experimental, and implement the protocol, before going to Proposed.  </s>
<s> It might get people focused on "running code" sooner rather than later, and some groups need that.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see a few groups try it before recommending it for everyone in APPS.  </s>
<s> I like this response.  </s>
<s> It sounds like a good thing to trial.  </s>
<s> However, its still tough to take the stigma of experimental, would be it possible to have the state called "standards-track  </s>
<s> experimental"?  </s>
<s> The problem is that many implementors are not interested in implementing things which are marked as "experimental".  </s>
