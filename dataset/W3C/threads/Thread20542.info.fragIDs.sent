<s> According to "Current state of CSS implementation" URL:"http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/CSSStatus.html" margins are fully supported by Amaya 6.2.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see the following CSS statement does not yield the expected result.  </s>
<s> p {margin-left: 15em; margin-right: 1em} With Amaya 6.2 both right and left margins are set to the left value.  </s>
<s> This seems to be a change from previous versions of Amaya.  </s>

<s> John Russell also tested on windows 98 version 6.2 (800x600) and got even more bizarre results.  </s>
<s> First letter margin 20 em but that was only thing on first line.  </s>
<s> Second line margin 20 em and rest of text... brought up horizontal scroll rather than wrapping.  </s>
<s> test program was: 1" p {margin-left:20em; margin-right:2em} p This is just a test of margins.  </s>
<s> There should be a 20em margin on the left and a 2 em margin on the right.  </s>
<s> quirk in amaya.  </s>
