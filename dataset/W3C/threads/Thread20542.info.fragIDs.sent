According to "Current state of CSS implementation" URL:"http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/CSSStatus.html" margins are fully supported by Amaya 6.2. 
As far as I can see the following CSS statement does not yield the expected result. 
p {margin-left: 15em; margin-right: 1em} With Amaya 6.2 both right and left margins are set to the left value. 
This seems to be a change from previous versions of Amaya.

John Russell also tested on windows 98 version 6.2 (800x600) and got even more bizarre results. 
First letter margin 20 em but that was only thing on first line. 
Second line margin 20 em and rest of text... brought up horizontal scroll rather than wrapping. 
test program was: 1" p {margin-left:20em; margin-right:2em} p This is just a test of margins. 
There should be a 20em margin on the left and a 2 em margin on the right. 
quirk in amaya.
