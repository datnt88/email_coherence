Hello, Our new charter went into effect last week. 
With this I am moving our home page to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ 
Note that the IG and WG pages are redirected to this new page. 
Should we change the mailing list address to w3c-wai-er? 
All other WAI groups have an e-mail address of that form (e.g., w3c-wai-ig, w3c-wai-gl), but I'm not too concerned with that. 
It might cause more confusion than it is worth. 
Just a thought.

By the way, can the "reply to" field in the e-mail be changed to the list and not the individual? 
Regards, Phill if we do that, we should think of calling it w3c-wai-ert, same for the site url: /WAI/ERT. 
nope, this is a W3C wide policy, discussed many times in various forum and very unlikely to change. 
if you're receiving duplicates, you need to sort that out on your side (like most people do, based on the message id). 
Wendy, Thanks for getting the new charter together. 
It looks good but I have a few comments: The mission statement refers to the WCAG 1.0 only. 
Should we not be working on the upcoming WCAG 2 as well? 
I see no mention of EARL. 
Should this be part of the charter? 
The charter refers to the AERT but it does not seem to be in our list of deliverables. 
I think we're going to need an AERT for the WCAG 2. This document is related to the GL and AU groups but I don't think either of those groups will create it. 
Should we (ER) take it on again? 
FTF meetings quarterly? 
Can we reduce that to every 6 months or even once per year? 
It's OK with me to change the name of the mailing list. 
Chris ATRC, University Of Toronto home Hmm, changing the name of the list is fine, so long as the archives are continuous with the old ones - i.e. if i go to the archive and search for something it should be able to search all the ER IG archives at once (or potentially the er-ig and er-wg ones...) I ahven't completely thought this through, but I guess you get the issue.. cheers Chaals
