<s> Hi All On our techniques call this week, several of us took the task of contacting experts in information architecture so that we could map out how all our  </s>
<s> various WCAG documents inter-relate, interlink, etc. Below is an exchange with a fellow I know that has quite a bit of experience in this.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, he is swamped right now with work but he offered some preliminary suggestions in an email exchange I had with him below.  </s>
<s> Blessings David MacDonald www.eramp.com  </s>
<s> So we're working on the accessibility guidelines for the W3C.  </s>
<s> There are a number of documents.  </s>
<s> 1) The WCAG 2.0 Guidelines (Technology independent principles) 2) The Gateway (technology independent techniques) 3) The Techniques specific (XHTML, CSS, VoiceXML etc) documents which give example techniques and show how to accomplish the principles laid out in  </s>
<s> the guidelines (#1)  </s>
<s> These documents will have many interlinks to each other.  </s>
<s> Makes sense.  </s>
<s> The W3C has a pretty good handle on XML but what we are looking for is an expert in "information architecture" who can get on one of our conference calls and discuss with us various strategies at managing the information so that we can have multiple views and flexible interlinking between the documents.  </s>
<s> Pretty succinct advice: manage the information as a whole and write  </s>
<s> stylesheets to aggregate and/or syndicate the information from/to different  </s>
<s> publications.  </s>
<s> When I say "whole" I don't mean "one big XML file" but  </s>
<s> syndicate "one XML file per thematic collection of raw information" for independent publications and using XSLT to aggregate from all necessary  </s>
<s> collections when building a piece of the output.  </s>
<s> How are your Guru skills on that?  </s>
<s> I do it *all* the time as I believe that is the way information management should be done with markup.  </s>
<s> All of the course delivery information is syndicated and aggregated in that fashion.  </s>
<s> No databases involved, just text aggregation using markup.  </s>
<s> Would that interest you (if you are a content architect)?  </s>
<s> As a contract or as a volunteer contribution?  </s>
<s> My volunteer time right now is tapped out with chairing two subcommittees on UBL and being the international secretariat for the ISO committee on markup.  </s>
<s> What specifically were you looking for as services from a content architect: defining the document models?  </s>
<s> writing the stylesheets?  </s>
<s> Let me know, David.  </s>
<s> Good luck on your committee!  </s>

<s> Hi all, It seems there are a couple of things that are necessary.  </s>
<s> As Wendy says, some idea about how to put together the information in ways that are useful to the people we want to read it is pretty fundamental, and not really technical in the sense of managing XML or whatever.  </s>
<s> For the mechanics, I would suggest looking at the way the RDF is used to manage things like the W3C's collection of technical reports, translations, and so on.  </s>
<s> Essentially the idea is that you can describe in a pretty flexible way relations between documents (or for that matter document fragments - e.g. technique number XYZ, extracted from teh techniques collection by an XSLT).  </s>
<s> You then use rules to drive XSLT or whatever to produce the actual information you want.  </s>
<s> For example, we might describe the entire collection of techniques as a list of techniques.  </s>
<s> Then for any given technique we might say it is relevant to a certain set of checkpoints.  </s>
<s> This will be the case in particular with interesting examples I think - showing people how to do several things at once, rather than assuming they can put together 14 atomic 3 line examples in a large project.  </s>
<s> This can be related to the information I suggested we gather about conformance, based on EARL.  </s>
<s> For example, we can declare that a given combination of techniques can satisfy a given set of checkpoints.  </s>
<s> And we can define a new profile of requirements any time we like, based on the material we have.  </s>
<s> For example, if tomorrow I get around to writing up a technique of using http://www.confusingwords.com as a way to clarify vocabulary usage, I can add information that says it is only relevant in english, whereas a different technique will be useful in spanish, and people can ask for anything relevant to a task and aparticular language (something that I don't think is built into the XML schemas we are using).  </s>
<s> This approach doesn't involve re-writing the XML schemmas, but providing a way to add extra RDF information about given techniques - assuming we can already identify them (which we can) we can tehn publish the additional information like a Web page and process it to get results we want.  </s>

<s> Folks, This discussion reminds me that I ought to mention how GEO is currently managing its techniques documents.  </s>
<s> We have recently made some changes to our approach compared to the early discussions we had with [tech] folks.  </s>
<s> The key driver for our changes was the splitting of our Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization[1] into 3 smaller topic-focussed documents[2] after the Tech Plenary.  </s>
<s> We will add more documents as material becomes available.  </s>
<s> Old approach: We had XML 'repositories' that contained a loose bag of techniques - one repository for XHTML/HTML, one for CSS, and potentially one that was not technology-specific.  </s>
<s> We used XSLT to combine appropriate parts of appropriate techniques into the XHTML document 'Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization'[1].  </s>
<s> An XML 'view' template was used to create the intended techniques document structure, but a subset of the detail was taken from techniques in the repository and this information was reorganised slightly during the process.  </s>
<s> We then ran XSLT on the techniques document we had produced to create an XHTML outline view[3] and a resources-only view - these therefore had exactly the same structure as the techniques doc.  </s>
<s> Users linked from the outline to the techniques doc on a section-by-section basis using icons.  </s>
<s> New approach: We have 3 techniques documents[2] we aim to take to Note status (more will come later), each created in XML by hand and containing techniques specific to a particular topic.  </s>
<s> They have their own structure and headings - whatever is most appropriate for the topic.  </s>
<s> We no longer have the former repositories.  </s>
<s> The XML documents are converted to XHTML using XSLT, which selects the appropriate information from each technique for the XHTML format, and reorganises it slightly.  </s>
<s> The outline[4] still exists (it's in development) but its structure and headings are created by hand, rather than by XSLT (so this is now the 'view' template).  </s>
<s> It groups together appropriate techniques from all appropriate techniques documents into a structure that is currently quite similar to the order in the documents themselves, but does not need to be, and it may re-use a given technique in more than one place.  </s>
<s> People link from the outline to the appropriate techniques document on a technique-by-technique basis by clicking on the technique text.  </s>
<s> So the general ideas haven't really changed - wrt information levelling - but the implementation has changed somewhat.  </s>
<s> This was forced by having split up the original doc into several pieces, but actually I feel much happier with this approach for a number of reasons.  </s>
<s> It's easier to work with, and allows for greater flexibility.  </s>
<s> Hope that's of some help, RI [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech/ [2] http://www.w3.org/International/publications.html [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline.html [4] .html  </s>
