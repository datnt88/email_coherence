<s> The specification for Range now says: 14.36.2 Range Retrieval Requests HTTP retrieval requests using conditional or unconditional GET methods may request one or more sub-ranges of the entity, instead of the entire entity, using the Range request header, which applies to the entity returned as the result of the request: However, I believe that the spec is silent on what the server should return for a Range if it also uses a content-coding, such as "gzip".  </s>

<s> Then should then 100 bytes covered by the Range/Content-Range refer to the second hundred bytes of the HTML file before compression, or to the second hundred bytes of the compressed form?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the only reasonable interpretation is that Range/Content-Range should apply to the unencoded form of the response, since the client's ultimate goal is to obtain a specific piece of the unencoded form; the use of compression is only a temporary phase that the response goes through while it is being transmitted.  </s>

<s> So, with some trepidation that this is not the only potential error lurking in the the spec as the result of the "entity" term, I suggest changing the first paragraph of 14.36.2 to read: HTTP retrieval requests using conditional or unconditional GET methods may request one or more sub-ranges of the entity, instead of the entire entity, using the Range request header, which applies to the entity returned as the result of the request, prior to the application of any content-coding: -Jeff  </s>

<s> This means that the ability to ask the server for a compressed copy of the part of the file that you don't have is sufficient to recover from the loss.  </s>
<s> Further, because of the relatively small window used by compression algorithms, the result would not be much larger than if you were able to retransmit exactly the bytes of the compressed form that were previously unavailable.  </s>
<s> Further, a slice out of the middle of a compressed form is totally useless by itself; e.g., you can't decompress the output of gzip without knowing the first few bytes of the output, because the rest of the compression depends on that prefix.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, a compressed form of a slice of the uncompressed form has some value, since it is possible to extract the unencoded slice.  </s>

<s> In other words: the stupidest link in the chain decides the encoding.  </s>
<s> 2) A client can't say that it "accepts" transfer codings, so there is no way to introduce the funkyflate compression.  </s>

<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> I am generally pursuaded that Roy is right, that we should be using both Content-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding, and that Range selections should be applied after Content-Encoding and before Transfer-Encoding.  </s>
<s> I also think that Henrik's proposal for Accept-Transfer is generally a good one.  </s>
<s> But there are still a few loose ends to tie up.  </s>
<s> 1) They don't have the same scope - one is end-to-end and the other is hop-by-hop.  </s>
<s> As the message length changes, it can only be used through proxies that know about that particular encoding.  </s>
<s> In other words: the stupidest link in the chain decides the encoding.  </s>
<s> More specifically, because Transfer-Encoding and Accept-Transfer are hop-by-hop fields, a response that flows through an HTTP/1.0 proxy can't have a Transfer-encoding (such as on-the-fly compression) for the two hops that involve that proxy.  </s>
<s> This is sad, but it does avoid a big problem with the use of new compression algorithms (or other codings): the possibility that such responses might be improperly cached by an HTTP/1.0 shared cache, and then delivered to a client that doesn't understand them.  </s>
<s> It might also provide some incentive for people to upgrade their 1.0 proxies to 1.1, since it's usually the proxy operator who is paying for the bandwidth on at least one side of the proxy.  </s>
<s> However, there is (at least) one more slight problem with the hop-by-hop nature of Transfer-Encoding.  </s>
<s> Section 15.1.1 (End-to-end and Hop-by-hop Headers) currently says: For the purpose of defining the behavior of caches and non- caching proxies, we divide HTTP headers into two categories: .  </s>
<s> End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the ultimate recipient of a request or response.  </s>
<s> End-to-end headers in responses must be stored as part of a cache entry and transmitted in any response formed from a cache entry. .  </s>
<s> Hop-by-hop headers, which are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and are not stored by caches or forwarded by proxies.  </s>
<s> The following HTTP/1.1 headers are hop-by-hop headers: .  </s>
<s> Connection .  </s>
<s> Keep-Alive .  </s>
<s> Public .  </s>
<s> Proxy-Authenticate .  </s>
<s> Transfer-Encoding .  </s>
<s> Upgrade [NOTE TO JIM GETTYS: the "must"s in that passage should be MUSTs, right?]  </s>
<s> The most simplistic interpretation of the phrase "Hop-by-hop headers ... and are not stored by caches or forwarded by proxies" implies that a transfer-encoding has to be removed by a proxy cache before the response is stored.  </s>
<s> Clearly, if a proxy supports a transfer-coding, and both the inbound server and the outbout client also support the same coding, then it would be a real waste of CPU time to do this for compressed transfer-codings.  </s>
<s> So I think that after .  </s>
<s> Hop-by-hop headers, which are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and are not stored by caches or forwarded by proxies.  </s>
<s> we should add: Note: a proxy or cache need not actually delete a hop-by-hop header in a case where its external behavior would be equivalent to deleting the header and then adding it again.  </s>
<s> For example, a proxy receiving a response with a non-identity transfer-coding need not remove that coding, and the corresponding Transfer-Encoding header field, unless the response is being sent to a client that has not sent an appropriate Accept-Transfer header.  </s>
<s> The other problem that we may need to clarify is that if a transfer-coding (e.g., "compress") is used with a Range response containing multiple ranges, then should the transfer-coding apply to the entire "multipart/byteranges" body, or just to the parts individually?  </s>
<s> It seems possible to leave this up to the server, and let the server choose the most appropriate option for a given response, rather than to try to embed the choice in the protocol specification.  </s>
<s> But this means that a client sending both a multi-part Range request and a non-identity "Accept-Transfer:" would have to be able to grok two different forms of response.  </s>
<s> E.g., combining the example in 19.2 with "compress", the client might get HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT Last-modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT Content-type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=THIS_STRING_SEPARATES --THIS_STRING_SEPARATES Content-type: application/pdf Content-range: bytes 500-999/8000 Transfer-Encoding: compress ...the first range..., compressed --THIS_STRING_SEPARATES Content-type: application/pdf Content-range: bytes 7000-7999/8000 Transfer-Encoding: compress ...the second range, compressed --THIS_STRING_SEPARATES-- or it might get HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT Last-modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT Content-type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=THIS_STRING_SEPARATES Transfer-Encoding: compress .... compressed form of the multipart/byteranges type .....

<s> (Multipart Types) seems to allow the first form: In HTTP, multipart body-parts MAY contain header fields which are significant to the meaning of that part.  </s>
<s> If this makes sense to people, then I would add this paragraph to the end of section 3.7.2  </s>
<s> (Multipart Types).  </s>
<s> If a client has indicated its acceptance of one or more non-identity transfer-codings (using the Accept-Tranfser header, section XXX) and it is otherwise appropriate to use a multipart type, the server MAY either apply a transfer-coding to the entire message-body, and MAY apply a transfer-coding to one or more of the individual body-parts.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Yep.  </s>
<s> The entire body, since Transfer-Encoding is not a MIME header field.  </s>
<s> The HTTP/1.1 message data model was designed to be easy to translate into a future version of HTTP that had better layering (i.e., actual instead of theoretical layers) between transfer and payload.  </s>
<s> That gets harder if we start pushing HTTP elements inside body parts.  </s>
