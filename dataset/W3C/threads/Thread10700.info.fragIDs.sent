I've updated the issue tracking doc to include objections and responses. 
There is a summary of the objections at [1]. 
Each objection links to 
the relevant issue (except completeness of entailment rules which may be about to go away) and its late. 
The relevant issue contains the WG response to the objection. 
I've taken into account feedback from DanC, which includes stating the conflicting requirements on the datatypes objection and some (much shorter) text on the I18N issue. 
Please review. 
The intent is that the request to advance will refer to the objections in the issue doc.

I gather you meant [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/ 
Very nice; I can see the whole issue in one place, and the issues with outstanding dissent are easy to find. 
I expect this will make briefing The Director quite straightforward, not to mention leaving a nice description of the situation for the community and any future WGs. 
Umm... this looks OK (except the "we request..." sentence, about which more below), but the shorter text was intended for the request for PR. I'd prefer to see the table of designs that the WG evaluated in the issues list under 
Umm... under I see "On these grounds the WG asks the director to support the decision of the WG despite outstanding dissent." 
Please leave that out of the issues list; it belongs only in the request for PR. 
This issues list has a long lifetime; the request is ephemeral. 
Right.

Brian, in order to be responsive to the I18N LC2 review, I think it's best to have the whole story there. 
Shall I go ahead and put it there? 
Do you have any pending edits since Revision 1.216 2003/11/11 19:59:19 ?
