Philippe, 
What's the status on the DOM Bindings Repository and the DOM Bindings Submission process? 
I've got a binding that I'd like to submit, but it doesn't look like the procedure for doing so is quite in place yet (some links at http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindings are still 404). 
Do I go ahead and make a formal DOM Binding Submission request to this list now? 
I'd like to follow the DOM Bindings Submission template at should I do?

I have an action item from the DOM Working Group to setup a page for them on the W3C DOM site. 
The decision was to only link them from the W3C site. 
Please send a link to your bindings in this mailing list and I'll add them in the future page, Philippe 
We didn't change our choose since: Here is the announcement for the page: and here is the page: Feel free to send me a pointer to your own bindings and I'll add them on the page. 
Regards, Philippe
