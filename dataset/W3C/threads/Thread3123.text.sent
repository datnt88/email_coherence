Alistair Miles CCLRC - Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Building R1 Room 1.60 Fermi Avenue Chilton Didcot Oxfordshire OX11 0QX United Kingdom Hey Steve, Hope you don't mind me forwarding this to the list, I think there's some really valuable comments here, worth discussing in the open. 
Cheers, Al. From: Steve Cayzer [mailto:steve.cayzer@hp.com]

any mileage in having a short glossary? 
I'm thinking of terms like intension subsumed source target concept - or just explain briefly 'in place' - especially the first 2. 2). 
I'm slightly surprised that when you say two concepts map, you don't give an ID for either concept. 
You say 'a hpm:concept with the prefLabel 'xyz' maps to a gcl:concept with the prefLabel 'abc' '. 
There's nothing to uniquely identify either, unless of course prefLabel is inverseFunctional, which I doubt :) I suspect that this has been sorted out and agreed on the thesaurus list, and that there's a good reason, but it would be nice to say what that reason is. 
3). 
You say that an exact mapping can be made between two concepts with different labels. 
Why not include such a mapping in your examples for extra clarity? 
4). 
b. Inexact mapping replace "It is recommended to use major or minor mappings instead, wherever possible." with "You are recommended to use major or minor mappings instead, wherever possible." or "Use major or minor mappings instead, wherever possible." 
5). 
d. Minor replace "Usage: Use this property when there is some small overlap in the intended meaning of source and target concepts." 
with "Usage: Use this property when there is some overlap in the intended meaning of source and target concepts." 
6). 
e. 
Partial replace "It is recommended that either broad or narrow mappings are used instead, wherever possible." with "You are recommended to use broad or narrow mappings instead, wherever possible." or "Use broad or narrow mappings instead, wherever possible." 7). 
i,j,k - AND/OR/NOT You can combine in arbitrary combinations (one assumes at least). 
Could say so. 8). 
section 3 I don't like the use of the term 'imply' - could be misleading in a logical language! 
I'd prefer 'indicate' or 'state'. 
My particular beef is with this statement "A major mapping statement implies that the source and target sets share greater than 50% of their members, a minor mapping implies less than 50% but greater than 0. " which I'd replace with "A major mapping statement indicates that the source and target sets probably share greater than 50% of their members, a minor mapping indicates less than 50% but greater than 0. " Similarly "A broad mapping states that the target set is a superset of the source set. 
A narrow mapping states that the target set is a subset of the source set." 9). 
The scope notes in the RDF schema use the word 'implies', this could be changed to 'states' if you think it's a good idea.
