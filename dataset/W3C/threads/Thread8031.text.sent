Surely folks are doing some kind of spec. 
conformance tests against their DAV servers. 
How did you do it? 
Has anyone fleshed these tests out into something available for others to use to test against their servers as well? 
What about developing some kind of test suite using SkunkDAV code to control it? 
Thanks, Erik Erik, OASIS has a long history of developing conformance tests. 
I copy this e-mail to Karl Best of OASIS who can provide you with all the details. 
I would suggest we all work together on this.

Thanks, Erik Sounds like a fine idea, and as the Skunkdav developer, I'd be glad to help in any way I can.

OASIS currently has a number of technical committees (TCs) working on conformance testing, though none of them are working specifically on DAV. 
One committee, Interoperability Conformance, is creating guidelines for the development of conformance tests. 
(See current OASIS TCs.) OASIS would be happy to host a new TC to work on conformance testing for DAV. 
The process for creating a new TC is quite simple, and essentially only requires the sponsorship of three representatives of OASIS member organizations. 
(See http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/process.shtml for the OASIS TC process.) I would be happy to work with any interested parties to get this set up.
