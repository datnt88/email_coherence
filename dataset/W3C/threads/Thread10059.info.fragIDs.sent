I should have said: my proposed fix is to drop this paragraph. 
#g I don't think this is necessarily a show-stopper, but I think it should be considered carefully: In [1] Section 1.3, 2nd para, talks about treating the assertion of a graph as merge with some other referenced graphs. 
While we may wish to discuss this as a possibility (personally, I am very uneasy about it), I think it could muddy the waters in a document that otherwise defines very clearly the meaning of an RDF *graph*. 
I think the issues of how RDF documents may be combined to create the RDF graphs on which entailments are defined should be kept very separate from the model theory itself.

OK, I'm fine with that, Consider it gone. 
Also I think the next para should be folded into the earlier 'we arent doing that' list of disclaimers in the 0.1 intro, would you agree? 
Then the remaining first para of 1.3 can just serve as a technical intro. 
to that 
section.

Yes, I agree that's better.
