All last year I asked: "Is it necessary to make a radio button in a fieldset checked? 
I know that it is a requirement for WCAG 10.4 but how useful is it? 
I'm a bit worried by setting one as checked for say, indicating a user's gender in a form, and then that user hitting return accidentally and sending information that they haven't actually entered. 
I guess the same applies to checkboxes. 
For text inputs the problem is less because the form will just submit something like "enter your name" instead of a name but with buttons the data sent could be valid but incorrect" I never actually received a response from anyone (not that I'm bitter ;-)) but the problem has just reared it's head again. 
I know that some people think that it's not actually necessary now to include default place-holders for text areas but does the same still hold for grouped controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes?

I am for neutrality on this. 
In other words, check nothing and leave it up to the user to decide what they want checked. 
Not only does this prevent entering accidental data, it also prevents entering optional data if the user wishes to do that. 
When you check something, you are apparently making assumptions about your users. 
I'm not sure what the reasoning is for having something checked by default but I also support the use of combo boxes where ever possible with the item at the box being a null item. 
If something needs to be chosen and nothing has been chosen, submission should inform the user that this needs to be done before acceptance will be granted and this also should be done within the form to help cut down on non submission of critical data. 
So, while I think the null approach is best, I could be persuaded by cogent arguments against my position being aware that I have been using assistive technology for around 30 years.

That would be my stance too but... (... but it doesn't get the logo which some people seem to think is important) Could anyone provide combinations of user agents/AT which won't recognise that the form control is there if a place holder is not present (or present other problems). 
I notice that in my copy of the draft WCAG2 (probably not the most recent) checkpoint 10.4 is to be replaced with Checkpoint 5.2 "Design for backward compatibility". 
How far back should we be looking?

why not have a "Starting" point radio button, something like "other" or "N/A" Bob "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve Neither liberty nor safety", Benjamin Franklin ASCII Ribbon Campaign accessBob NO HTML/PDF/RTF in e-mail accessys@smartnospam.net NO MSWord docs in e-mail Access Systems, engineers NO attachments in e-mail, *LINUX powered* access is a civil right THIS message and any attachments are CONFIDENTIAL and may be privileged. 
They are intended ONLY for the individual or entity named To do otherise will result in undefined browser behaviour: If no radio button in a set sharing the same control name is initially "on", user agent behavior for choosing which control is initially "on" is undefined. 
Note. 
Since existing implementations handle this case differently, the current specification differs from RFC 1866 ([67][RFC1866] section 8.1.2.4), which states: Which is why I also asked if anyone had a list of UA/AT that would display unfavourable behaviours. 
Are we at a stage now where all UA that we can *reasonably* expect to be in use can cope with there being no control that is initially "on"? 
--J. 
I think they can all cope, they are just not required to cope in the same way. 
I believe, you will find that if you read on from the quote, you will find that the earlier preferred action was to select the first item in the list, which is not, I think, the behaviour you want.
