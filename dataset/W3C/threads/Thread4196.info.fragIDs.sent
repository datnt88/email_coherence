<s> Here's my opinion: the semantics of "close match" for a structure can be highly application-dependent, and it's not clear to me whether there is an approach to approximate structural match that will work at all well across a variety of structures from different application areas.  </s>

<s> To get useful results, it may be the case that the user really does need to let us know, in some way, which criteria to relax.  </s>
<s> There may be literature or products that tell us that we actually know how to do this well in the general case - do you know of any that we might want to look at?  </s>

<s> Thanks Sihem  </s>
<s> Kai,  </s>
<s> From where I sit, the first thing we need is full-text querying in XQuery encompassing functionalities which currently exist.  </s>
<s> As a librarian and expert searcher, I find even stemming algorithms fail me often enough that I want to retain the crude, but totally controllable predictable wildcards.  </s>
<s> I build better queries with wildcards then I can with stemming, because stemming doesn't allow me to  </s>
<s> decide which related words to include on a word by word basis.  </s>
<s> Just because it is linguistically related doesn't mean it returns the results  </s>
<s> I want.  </s>
<s> Stemming is black box which works against expert searchers as  </s>
<s> often as it work for them.  </s>
<s> We feel the same about scoring and ranking.  </s>
<s> Different users benefit from different tools.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't expect a novice user to use wildcards or to be so annoyed with scoring and ranking.  </s>
<s> Which doesn't mean I wouldn't welcome the likes of a linguistic parser.  </s>
<s> It would be a boon to all end users.  </s>
<s> Are you recommending we add a use  </s>
<s> case which calls an implementation-defined linguistic parser (as we did  </s>
<s> for stemming) or are you recommending more than that?  </s>
<s> Pat  </s>
<s> Kai Gro?johann kai.grossjohann@uni-duisburg.de 03/24/03 01:14PM  </s>
<s> IMHO this is an unnecessary limitation.  </s>
<s> In the following I will say "linguistic phrase search" when talking about the operation I mean, to avoid confusion with the FTS document.  </s>

<s> from  </s>

<s> the  </s>
<s> If you have a linguistic parser that recognizes that "elementary and secondary education" is the same as "elementary education and secondary education", then you don't need kludges such as proximity search to correctly find the linguistic phrase "elementary education".  </s>
<s> So by focussing on the ordered/unordered proximity search with various constraints, system containing a linguistic parser are left standing in the rain.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to imagine what does the user want to do, semantically, and then define search predicates that capture this idea.  </s>
<s> Then it is left to the implementor (of the XQuery processing engine) to decide how to do it.  </s>
<s> Of course, it's possible to recognize that linguistic parsers are not common in text retrieval systems yet, and to include some other search predicates to accomodate for this fact.  </s>
<s> But why let the standards definition be influenced by what current systems do?  </s>
<s> The FTS definition has successfully made the step from the syntactic level (wildcards) to the semantic level (stemming) in one case -- normalization of derived forms.  </s>
<s> I am suggesting to make this very same step in other cases, as well: searching for (linguistic) noun phrases (perhaps other kinds of phrases), searching for similarly-sounding words (Soundex is only one algorithm for this), accomodating for OCR errors or typos (the Damerau-Levenshtein metric is one approach), searching for similar dates, searching for similarly-looking colors, and so on.  </s>
<s> Note that the FTS document does not say how to implement stemming.  </s>
<s> So I don't expect that a similar lack of specification how linguistic phrase search will be implemented is a problem.  </s>
<s> I think that I'm having problems to express the ideas in my mind.  </s>
<s> I hope you can understand them even though the expression is clumsy.  </s>
<s> A preposition is not a good thing to end a sentence with.  </s>
<s> Thank you for the education.  </s>
<s> I'm not an expert searcher, it never occurred to me that stemming could be a problem in this way.  </s>
<s> It is very close.  </s>
<s> I am suggesting to add a use case which does "linguistic phrase search" and leave it to the implementation whether they use a linguistic parser or map it to proximity search or they ask the Oracle of Delphi.  </s>
<s> A preposition is not a good thing to end a sentence with.  </s>
<s> Dear Kai, while I see this as a use case, please note that the use case document also serves as a way for the working group to define what use cases it currently investigates for its current version of the language design.  </s>

<s> We use that information to tune the coefficients.  </s>

<s> For me, it's more or less red.  </s>
<s> (This is a somewhat silly example, but you could include color similarities, then it would make more sense.  </s>

<s> I think the challenge will be to come up with a spec small enough and simple enough that it can be reviewed, understood, implemented and tested, yet large enough to be useful, and extensible enough that the sort of features you describe can be added in later versions, or by individual implementations.  </s>
<s> And to do so in under five years :-)  </s>
<s> I understand that this is a problem.  </s>
<s> But I think that you might have to try to work around this problem to a certain extent.  </s>
<s> I think it comes from the point of view that a standard for a query language must define completely a function that, given a query and a set of database records (or XML documents), produces a set of results.  </s>
<s> I believe that this just won't work for Information Retrieval: in Information Retrieval, the exact result set is a distinguishing criterion between systems!  </s>
<s> Some IR systems have better retrieval quality than others, because they compute different result sets.  </s>
<s> So you need to find a way to craft a meaningful spec WITHOUT prescribing the exact result set.  </s>
<s> One example to support this view: you say that it might become necessary to specify a stemming algorithm before FTS becoms a standard.  </s>
<s> But in some languages, it is not feasible to do stemming algorithmically (like the Porter stemmer does for English) -- dictionary-based approaches are needed.  </s>
<s> I think the consequences of this for prescribing the stemming algorithm are obvious.  </s>
<s> In the same vein, it's clear that linguistic phrase search is a useful feature, but it's totally unclear how to implement it.  </s>
<s> And different systems will compute different results, and this will be a discriminating factor between systems.  </s>
<s> Therefore you need to write a standard that says "there shall be linguistic phrase search" *without* prescribing the exact results.  </s>
<s> And the above are just examples.  </s>
<s> Besides stemming and (linguistic) phrase search, there will be many other places where the standard can't prescribe the results.  </s>
<s> It will be the norm, rather than the exception.  </s>
<s> That is my opinion, at least.  </s>
<s> A preposition is not a good thing to end a sentence with.  </s>
<s> 1. As I mentioned in a separate mail, the use cases should encompass functionality that the consensus in the WG considers to be important for discussion for the first version more than giving a repository of all possible use cases in the area of information retrieval.  </s>
<s> 2. Your use case of application of SCORE to non-text conditions is captured in the requirements document mainly for allowing researchers, vendors and at some point in time the WG to add such functionality.  </s>
<s> I personally consider that to be an important use case in the future, but do not see it as an important feature for this release and thus having it as part of the use cases seems a bit premature.  </s>
<s> Nobody is asking you to save the whole world in two days :-) I'm just saying that there are two important fields, DB and IR. Doing querying on XML documents, for me, is half IR and half DB. But the current XQuery effort appears to be something like 0.1 IR and 0.9 DB.  </s>
<s> If things stay this way, then XQuery will become something that is useful for the DB community, but it won't be useful for the IR community.  </s>
<s> People who want to build an IR system for XML documents won't be able to use XQuery as the standard, not even with the currently discussed FTS features.  </s>
<s> There was a panel discussion during the XML-IR workshop at the SIGIR 2002 in Tampere, and the impression I got was that the XQuery effort is not currently useful for IR and that folks are eager to help out, if only they were asked.  </s>
<s> I'm just a lowly PhD student who should rather be working on his thesis.  </s>
<s> But I had the urge to go out and wave the IR flag at least a little bit, to do what little I can.  </s>
<s> (I'm dreaming of a probabilistic version of XQuery but will have to settle for a probabilistic version of XPath, and that will be quite incomplete.  </s>
<s> But it is going to include vagueness and uncertainty as central concepts, in all parts of XPath.  </s>
<s> I don't even dare dreaming of a probabilistic RDF (yet?).) If you say that XQuery/FTS needs its first version soon, then maybe the way to go is to ask some IR folks to make sure you're not preventing XQuery from being developed in the general direction of IR later on.  </s>
<s> Then you can save the big discussion for XQuery/FTS version 2. Thank you for listening.  </s>
