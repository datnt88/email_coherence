<s> Hi, Finally got a chance to go over the recent drafts.  </s>
<s> Just a point.  </s>
<s> 1.3[CORE] Under Definitions for Checkpoint 1.3 there is this phrase; "Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be sensed by the user."  </s>
<s> What is meant by "sensed"?  </s>
<s> It's wording that is rather foreign to me.  </s>
<s> It's kind of "touchy feely".  </s>
<s> I'm thinking "easily comprehended" rather than sensed.  </s>
<s> Yours truly, Geoff Deering  </s>
<s> Jeff, good question about "sensed" versus "easily comprehended."  </s>
<s> All the checkpoints under guideline 1 are (or should be) aimed at making it possible for users to actually *perceive* content-- that is, to be aware that it exists.  </s>
<s> It's a much lower level of abstraction than understanding (which the checkpoints in Guideline 3 address).  </s>
<s> The issue of whether I understand a given resource is moot if I don't even know it's there.  </s>
<s> So the notion that content can be "sensed" isn't as fuzzy as it might sound: in fact, sensing/perceiving is much more readily testable than "understanding," which is as fuzzy and vast as the sky.  </s>
<s> And as important, of course.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps!  </s>

<s> In that case I feel it should read; "Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be perceived by the user."  </s>
<s> We are dealing with Guideline 1: Perceivable.  </s>
<s> This would be consistent with the guideline.  </s>

<s> I feel "perceivable" strengthens this as it is the word that is used to define this guideline, and is also directly appropriate in this context.  </s>
<s> "Sensed" can refer to an intuition about the presence of something, but still with some uncertainty (I sensed something was there, but I was unsure).  </s>

<s> It leaves a question mark about the whole experience, it is a word, when used in this context, conveys uncertainty.  </s>
<s> Perceived means you did actually have some confirming experience of a perception that the object was there, through whichever sensory organ you wish to establish communication with that medium.  </s>
