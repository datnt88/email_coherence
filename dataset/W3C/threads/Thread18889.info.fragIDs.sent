<s> Hi Mark,  </s>
<s> Since many people who are deaf learn sign language as their first natural language, written text is a "second language" and often very different from the structure of sign language.  </s>
<s> For example, American sign language expressions are formed very differently than American English.  </s>
<s> Therefore, some of these people find it hard to read written text - as it is a second language.  </s>

<s> ahhh!  </s>
<s> I see your point!  </s>
<s> Yes, this makes no sense at all.  </s>
<s> This should say something along the lines of: Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are blind and for many people with the reading difficulties that often accompany cognitive disabilities, and learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> Non-text equivalents are helpful for individuals who have reading difficulties associated with deafness.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> We will smooth out the wording and add it to the errata page.  </s>
