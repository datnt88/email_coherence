Hello, It was suggested that in addition to putting an icon in documents to indicate conformance, that we put meta information in the document, e.g., via META. 
Can we add this as an item for discussion on the next GL agenda?

ratings (c 1))' Issue: - we need an icon for the rating system that's different from the individual icons for each conformance level (right now I've used the icon for level A but I would suggest using a version without A in it) - the metadata label itself (what's in the META tag) is a valid claim of conformance I think: it has all the information needed in Form 1, although for most of it you have to follow a pointer: The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505 
The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A". 
From the label, you follow http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag-conformance which is the rating system with the description or the overall system and the description of what "(c 1)" means. 
The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined portion of a site.). 
PICS label can be generic ("gen true") or specific to indicate scope This is a bit different from the use of an icon, since it doesn't have the icon. 
I think having the PICS statement means that there is a reference to the conformance statement, which satisfies the requirement. 
It is, after all, possible to make the conformance statement about a page on a piece of paper stuck behind the door (although it might not be very useful - this is another, more helpful way of doing that.)
