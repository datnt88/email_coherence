<s> This is an obvious "bug" in WCAG 1.0 (and as William said, we are planning to fix it in WCAG 2.0, speaking as someone on the WCAG working group).  </s>
<s> Right now, I believe that "until user agents" requires the reader of the WCAG document (or the person doing the testing) to make their own judgments about how far technology has advanced.  </s>
<s> So it is really your call.  </s>
<s> (This is why I call it a "bug" in WCAG 1.0!) In my opinion, I would say that side-by-side text with no alternative page/representation does not pass a strict interpretation of triple  </s>
<s> A, but then I can't ever imagine designing a practical site for full triple-A compliance anyway.  </s>

<s> As long as all working groups use the same approach, this will be best since the requirement will be in one and hopefully only one place, either the content, the browser, or the assistive technology.  </s>
<s> That's not to say  </s>
<s> that we can't change that in the future as technology advances.  </s>
<s> Could you imagine requiring all GUI windows programs to have a command line equivalent in order to be considered accessible?  </s>
<s> Amen! Seems that making the www.w3.org/WAI site both practical and accessible is a daunting task - especially when one or both of the two definitions could have "bugs".  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> I _like_ command lines but I certainly get your point.  </s>
<s> ;)  </s>
<s> Yes, I think that WCAG 1.0 is a good set of information but a bad implementation plan and the "bugs" are an indication that it is not really "fully implementable."  </s>
<s> I think this is something that we need to seriously address in WCAG 2.0 before submitting it for approval as a recommendation.  </s>
<s> If the WAI site itself can't be made "fully accessible" -- triple-A accessible -- without undertaking major effort, sacrificing design considerations, damaging usability, and imposing undue burden, then obviously there are problems with our working definitions.  </s>
