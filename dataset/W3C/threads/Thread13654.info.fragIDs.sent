A number of guidelines require workarounds "until user agents" do certain 
things. 
For example in http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support it says Checkpoint 10.3 Checkpoint text: Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text alternative (on the current page or some other) for all tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns. 
Status: IBM's Home Page Reader in combination with Netscape Navigator (4.5, Win98) and Henter Joyce's JAWS in combination with Microsoft Internet Explorer (4.0 and higher, Win98) are instances of a browser and assistive technology combination that can linearize a table. 
Opera (3.6, Win98) allows a user to linearize tables. 
Lynx (2.81, Unix) renders tables by row. 
Silas' Gateway and other tools being developed by the ER Working Group [ER-IG] allow users to linearize tables. 
However, only Microsoft Internet Explorer (4.0 and higher, Win98) with HelpDB and WWW with EmacsSpeak allow a user to navigate within and between the cells of a table. 
Does this mean that we no longer need at linear text alternative?

documents! 
We will most likely deal with what's supposed to be.

Good news indeed. 
As a practical matter, though, what do I do now when e.g. judging if a page with side by side text and no alternative page meets triple A. Yes or No? 
I don't know if there is a clear answer. 
This is an obvious "bug" in WCAG 1.0 (and as William said, we are planning to fix it in WCAG 2.0, speaking as someone on the WCAG working group). 
Right now, I believe that "until user agents" requires the reader of the WCAG document (or the person doing the testing) to make their own judgments about how far technology has advanced. 
So it is really your call. 
(This is why I call it a "bug" in WCAG 1.0!) In my opinion, I would say that side-by-side text with no alternative page/representation does not pass a strict interpretation of triple 
A, but then I can't ever imagine designing a practical site for full triple-A compliance anyway.

As long as all working groups use the same approach, this will be best since the requirement will be in one and hopefully only one place, either the content, the browser, or the assistive technology. 
That's not to say 
that we can't change that in the future as technology advances. 
Could you imagine requiring all GUI windows programs to have a command line equivalent in order to be considered accessible? 
Amen! Seems that making the www.w3.org/WAI site both practical and accessible is a daunting task - especially when one or both of the two definitions could have "bugs".

I _like_ command lines but I certainly get your point. 
;) 
Yes, I think that WCAG 1.0 is a good set of information but a bad implementation plan and the "bugs" are an indication that it is not really "fully implementable." 
I think this is something that we need to seriously address in WCAG 2.0 before submitting it for approval as a recommendation. 
If the WAI site itself can't be made "fully accessible" -- triple-A accessible -- without undertaking major effort, sacrificing design considerations, damaging usability, and imposing undue burden, then obviously there are problems with our working definitions.

Hmmm. 
I think we will also deal with what is. 
But it is intended to make it clearer which is which and how to decide in the same way toher people will.

I think this should be asked of WCAG - so I have forwarded it to them and request it be discussed at the earliest possible opportunity on the agenda.
