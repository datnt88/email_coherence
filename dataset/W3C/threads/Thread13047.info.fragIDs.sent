<s> Regrets and Outreach update: On May 9, 2002, Connecticut's Department of Information Technology sent a Notice to IT Consultants requiring Consultants in the web developer, etc. skill classifications to receive training being offered by the state.  </s>

<s> After that date, only those consultants who have been trained will be authorized to work in those categories.  </s>
