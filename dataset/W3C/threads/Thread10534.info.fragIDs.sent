<s> ...ends with: "Notice that the question of whether or not a class contains itself as a member is quite different from the question of whether or not it is a subclass of itself.  </s>

<s> Good catch, but we have imposed reflexivitiy of subClassOf, so its still true.  </s>

<s> And there was me feeling all clever for a second ;) Can you explain briefly why subClassOf is reflexive now?  </s>
<s> (just curious, and to leave a papertrail... (apologies if it's in the spec someplace I missed)).  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> The reasons didn't get recorded in the minutes, but (since I just dug it out to check for myself) the meeting IRC log is here: around 15:10.  </s>
<s> Briefly, we could have gone either way on the reflexivity issue, it being pretty much orthogonal to intensionality, and it gives us a way to express a degree of equivalence between classes.  </s>
<s> Also, it was less change to the existing spec.  </s>
