<s> to follow up on what Jon Gunderson said:  </s>
<s> 1) that any graphics used as bullets have the alt text "Item" With a character to cause a pause after the word.  </s>
<s> I think "item" is needed.  </s>
<s> Is there any way to get the item number in the specification.  </s>
<s> Like item 1, item 2, item 3. This helps people keep track of where they are.  </s>
<s> Are you in touch with anyone currently using Laura Eaves's extended numbering functions in Lynx?  </s>
<s> Numbering items in an UL is a bit like numbering sections in a document which only has Hn tags in it.  </s>
<s> The browser can get this into the User Interface without the author putting it in the ALT.  </s>
<s> Using ALT to achieve this has a less than rosy prognosis, in my gut reaction.  </s>
<s> This is also an application scenario of interest in the CSS2 review context.  </s>
<s> If we get numbering tooled up to the extent the Braille users would like, I think one could write a style that will cause OL entries to be numbered.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> I agree completely with Al's comments.  </s>
<s> For the present, if item numbers are desired, the best solution is to take advantage of the OL element.  </s>
<s> CSS numbering should allow the user's default style sheet to number UL elements automatically if desired.  </s>
<s> CSS also allows audio cues to be associated with list items (LI elements), thus overcoming any difficulties that readers may experience in identifying the beginning of each item.  </s>
<s> Of course, authors need to use the correct markup, and it is the purpose of the guidelines to encourage them to do so.  </s>
<s> When accessing the web via a braille display, I would prefer that bullets indicating list items be represented by the asterisk character, as in Lynx 2.7.1.  </s>
<s> In such a case, it would be best to use the UL and LI elements, and a null ALT value if the bullet is to be represented by an image.  </s>
<s> For example: li img alt="" src="bullet.jpg"  </s>
<s> Item 1 Unfortunately, braille displays are often overlooked when designing HTML access guidelines.  </s>
<s> This situation also indicates that the sooner audio and braille style sheet mechanisms are implemented, the easier it will be for HTML authors to design their documents in such a way as to meet everyone's needs.  </s>
<s> If the word "item" preceded every item in a list, this would undoubtedly be detrimental to the efficiency with which the document could be read via a 40-cell braille display, even if the software is configured to apply braille contractions automatically.  </s>
<s> The fact that solutions which are appropriate for speech synthesizers are not necessarily convenient when when using a braille display, and that such conventions are different again from those which are most effective on screen or in print, highlights the need for a flexible and sophisticated style sheet mechanism for controlling the presentation of HTML documents.  </s>
