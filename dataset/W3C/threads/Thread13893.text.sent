Hi, Does anyone know of any programs that help to make powerpoints accessible for the blind? 
Or know of other resources? 
Thanks.

You might want to check on the w3c-wai-ig list for people who have used it. 
I tried a quick search to see if there had been previous discussion on the IG list about PowerTalk but did not find anything.
