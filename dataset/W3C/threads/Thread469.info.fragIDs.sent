<s> I'm trying to compile JTidy, trouble is that there's similar DOM code in JTidy and Xerces.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason why JTidy doesn't use the code from Xerces?  </s>
<s> Which code should I use?  </s>
<s> Is Xerces newer?  </s>
<s> JTidy doesn't appear to work with Xerces DOM code.  </s>
<s> Historically, I think Andy used his own DOM classes when developing/incorporating the DOM support into JTidy.  </s>
<s> However, I think its a good idea for everyone to be reading off the same page.  </s>
<s> The Xerces people seem to keep as up to date as anyone.  </s>
<s> I believe there might be a licensing issue here.  </s>
<s> I'm copying Sami on this email because maybe he could check the Xerces license at is compatible with the JTidy license.  </s>
<s> If so, I'll move their classes in and make JTidy implement all of the required methods.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I'll start adding the required methods to the JTidy DOM classes.  </s>
<s> Xerces is newer but, as you saw, you can't compile JTidy with it unless you implement the unimplemented methods yourself.  </s>

<s> Greetings,  </s>
<s> Hmm, there might be some licensing issues at play here.  </s>
<s> The Tidy code at the moment uses a W3C license, which is really liberal.  </s>
<s> Inclusion of Apache licensed software (like Xerces) would require that a) JTidy begins to agree with the terms of the Apache license and b) any software based on JTidy would also need to be Apache-friendly.  </s>
<s> The Apache license is rather liberal too, but it requires the clause "this product uses software..." present in the product or its documentation.  </s>
<s> The license issue needs sorting out anyhow.  </s>
<s> When I asked Andy about it, he replied that basically Dave and W3C control that issue.  </s>
<s> I am not a lawyer or a licence expert, so I think that a clearer license than the one currently manifested in the JTidy sources might come in handy.  </s>
<s> I don't know.  </s>
<s> People who've worked with JTidy longer should really comment on this.  </s>
<s> Please do not do anything yet that would require us to include Xerces in the distribution, as the license issue needs to be sorted out first.  </s>
<s> Suggestions?  </s>

<s> Sami -- My changes to JTidy won't _require_ the Xerces DOM classes, only _allow_ them for people who want to use them instead of JTidy's DOM classes.  </s>
<s> We'll leave it so that they can get the Xerces DOM classes themselves.  </s>
<s> I should be able to put those changes in today or tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Most of the method implementations will be null (we won't support DOM 2 (yet)) but at least the compile will work.  </s>

<s> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- I noticed the same thing last week and ripped JTidy DOM code out.  </s>
<s> I have been using the new jar with Xerces DOM and have not seen any problem yet.  </s>
<s> Caveat, I have not exercised the DOM code in all that much.  </s>
<s> Tin Le PS. "ripped out" mean I unzipped the tidy.jar  </s>
<s> file, delete the dom dirs, and re-zip.  </s>

<s> I'm using xerces 1.2.1 and needed to make some modifications just to get it to compile.  </s>
