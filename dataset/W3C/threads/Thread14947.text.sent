Hi all Per the previous note we have tried to compile a listing of the people whom we have been able to identify as contributing significantly to the WCAG efforts. 
We went back over the last 5000 postings and checked meeting minutes. 
However we undoubtedly have missed someone ? 
so let us know if we missed you or you see someone we have left out. 
It is hard to look at a list and see who is not there. 
Also listed below is an updated list of the Members in Good Standing and our New members. 
See you on the web. 
The WCAG Chairs Oh, one more thing -- Please correct any misspellings and also please send me an email (not on the list) with the correct international characters for your name if it is incorrect below. 
Mostly these are lifted from email and I know by looking at them that some are not correct even though I can't accurately repair them. 
Thanks.

No problem. 
We had already been talking about how to recognize the full group of contributors (but in a different context) -- and we were also worrying about the term "good standing". 
We / I just should have thought of posting the list of contributors on the participants page at the same time we released the "good standing" list. 
My fault. 
Thanks everyone for hanging in there.
