<s> I am not finding anything in the DOM spec about this, but I just want to make sure that the following is a carry-over from old Netscape versions rather than part of their Netscape 6 DOM-1 compliancy....  </s>
<s> Is referencing an HTML form-field value allowed by specifying document.  </s>
<s> formName .  </s>
<s> fieldName .value  </s>

<s> Or does it need to be  </s>

<s> What you are referring to is valid DOM-0 (legacy) functionality in a JavaScript  </s>
<s> (now ECMAScript) binding context.  </s>
<s> Not in the standard DOM bindings.  </s>
<s> Your implementation may support it as an additional API,, but portability is not guaranteed.  </s>
<s> (Dynamically adding fields to objects is a very JavaScriptish approach; the DOM is designed for cross-language portability, and most languages won't let you get away with this.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Hmm, do you have a DOM-0 spec that shows that it's not just some implementation-specific thingie?  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> To my recollection, no spec for a "DOM-0" exists.  </s>
<s> I think it's EXTREMELY unwise to rely on anything that can only claim to be a legacy.  </s>
<s> Use DOM L1 functionality wherever possible.  </s>

<s> Actually, I do have "a DOM-0 spec" as it were.  </s>
<s> I wrote it into the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) DASE (DTV Application Software Environment) Declarative Applications (DA) specification.  </s>
<s> This spec precisely specifies "DOM-0" legacy behavior as was expressed by a union of IE3 and NN3 functionality, roughly what one can describe as JavaScript 1.1.  </s>
<s> The material is partly based on a new SMPTE standard underway to codify DOM-0 behavior for use with ATVEF (Advanced Television Enhancement Forum) content.  </s>
<s> While I would agree that the behavior being discussed is is not explicitly supported in DOM-[12] or by Java bindings, it is universally supported by all UAs that accommodate this well establish client-side JavaScript usage.  </s>
<s> Notwithstanding this, if one is creating content for DOM-[12] and beyond, I would recommend using DOM-[12] core functionality and not this technique.  </s>
<s> Regards, Glenn  </s>
<s> "DOM Level 0" is an informal term used by the DOM working group as a shorthand for "The nonstandard APIs that the W3C DOM set out to standardize."  </s>
<s> So yes, it's really those "implementation-specific thingies" that happened to work semi-reliably in some of the most popular browsers.  </s>
<s> (There has been some discussion of going back and trying to figure out just what subset of those APIs really were common enough to represent a de facto standard, to aid those who have no choice but to interface with those older systems.  </s>
<s> The DOM Working Group really doesn't have the spare cycles to do this, but several other committies have suggested they might look at it, and if they do I expect we'll review their work.)  </s>
<s> Absolutely.  </s>
<s> The legacy calls should be considered nonportable.  </s>
<s> If you really want to write a page that will be viewable only with specific browsers, and not necessarily with future versions of those browsers... Ask yourself whether that's really a good idea.  </s>
