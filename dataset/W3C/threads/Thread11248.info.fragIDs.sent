<s> In the SGML world, the word "parser" does not mean "parser" as used elsewhere in the field of computing.  </s>
<s> It has a special, SGML meaning.  </s>
<s> An SGML parser does indeed do validation.  </s>
<s> Whether an XML parser (in the usual sense of the word parser) should do validation is another matter entirely.  </s>
<s> I agree with you that namespace checking doesn't belong in a (CS) parser.  </s>
<s> It's part of the semantics layer, if you will.  </s>
<s> But I wouldn't expect a CS parser to check that an element had been declared either -- that would be done in a separate module/class/layer.  </s>
<s> In this mailing list at least, the word "parser" is generally taken in the SGML sense, although I would agree that it isn't clear.  </s>
<s> Would it help if the XML spec used different terminology?  </s>
<s> E.g. the XML Input Reader and the XML Input Checker, or something?? (an SGML/XML parser contains both of these)  </s>

<s> The XML-Lang spec calls the parsing thingie an "XML processor."  </s>
<s> And there are two kinds: nonvalidating and validating.  </s>
<s> Are these unclear with respect to classic CS terminology?  </s>
