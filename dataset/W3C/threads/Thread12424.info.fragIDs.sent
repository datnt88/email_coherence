<s> I was just watching "The Web" on the Sci-Fi channel and Microsoft just ran a commercial about how they're making computers accessible for the blind.  </s>
<s> The used a gentleman named Peter Wong who was listed as a Microsoft Engineer......interesting.  </s>
<s> It seemed like they were trying to vindicate themselves rather than inform the public, however.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> At least it is press and, unfortunately, its more than anyone else has done on a commercial.  </s>
<s> I feel the public needs the shock affect and to see people mainstreamed.  </s>
<s> Overall, it is positive press.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, other companies will see the potential customers and dollar signs in their pockets and do the same, for example, maybe IBM.  </s>
<s> There is some additional information on the WAI IG where the member from Microsoft mentioned they were doing five commercials that showed five people using computers to help them.  </s>
<s> It was interesting.  </s>
<s> If anyone still has this or can easily find it on the archive list, please post.  </s>
<s> It offers some good insight.  </s>

<s> Here is my attempt to compress the reference card down to a manageble size while incorporating as many of the ideas that were contributed.  </s>
<s> It includes an introduction, and a line about where to go for more information.  </s>
<s> I also drew inspiration from Harvey's posting on universal web design that arrived today.  </s>
<s> I have had to reorganize and reword more than I expected.  </s>
<s> My criterion for rejecting a previous rendition was if I had to read it more than twice to understand the point.  </s>
<s> This version is under 190 words, and it could be shorter.  </s>
<s> However, because I have made so many changes, I decided to stop here to get peoples' reactions.  </s>
<s> A point of departure in my version is the use of a title for each section.  </s>
<s> This is to draw the eye to important points while working in such a  </s>
<s> confined space.  </s>
<s> Thus you will note: "Hypertext links," "Backgrounds," etc.  </s>
<s> You can't cram much more on a business card.  </s>
<s> I originally marked it up as  </s>
<s> Times Roman 6 point, but I had trouble reading it with my 20:20 vision.  </s>
<s> So I cut and reformated until everything was in Times Roman 8 point.  </s>
<s> That's the smallest size that my over-40 eyes could handle.  </s>
<s> A sans-serif font will be very difficult to read on this scale.  </s>
<s> There are ten points.  </s>
<s> Maybe we could call them the "Ten HTML Commandments," or something to that effect.  </s>
<s> (That's what Dena Shumila called the set of guidelines we came up with in 1996.) The content follows.  </s>
<s> A life-size mockup, in Word 97 format, is attached.  </s>
<s> Send your comments and corrections directly to me, and I will try to incorporate them before Thursday's meeting.  </s>

<s> World Wide Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative  </s>
<s> Hand-, eye-, and ear-free features to make your site accessible to people with disabilities and individuals who have portable devices and slow connections:  </s>
<s> Hypertext links Use descriptive hypertext links.  </s>
<s> Each link should make sense when read alone or out of context.  </s>
<s> Photographs, images &amp; animations Describe content or purpose within the Alt="text" attribute.  </s>
<s> Create text alternatives.  </s>
<s> Backgrounds Choose uncluttered backgrounds and contrasting text and background colours.  </s>
<s> Imagemaps Many people cannot use a mouse.  </s>
<s> Duplicate imagemap hot spots as a list of text anchors.  </s>
<s> Ensure that every link can be activated using keyboard commands.  </s>
<s> Tables Prepare a text-only page that describes its content.  </s>
<s> Graphs &amp; charts Summarize content.  </s>
<s> Make the raw data available.  </s>
<s> Frames Label each frame with TITLE , and include a simplified version of its content within the NOFRAMES attribute.  </s>
<s> Audio Prepare audio descriptions, or link to a page that contains transcripts or descriptions.  </s>
<s> Page organization Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages easy to scan.  </s>
<s> Evaluate accessibility  </s>
<s> Try different browsers; switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard, without a mouse; use a monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.  </s>
<s> See www.w3.org/WAI for the complete WAI Page Author Guidelines  </s>
<s> A sans-serif font will be very difficult to read on this scale.  </s>
<s> Recent studies have shown that serif faces are just faster to read at normal size, but that sans-serif lead to better understanding and overall stronger subjective preference (i.e. people like them better).  </s>
<s> This should be replaced by the W3C + WAI logo (as seen on top of www.w3.org/WAI).  </s>
<s> I'd rather use an active sentence, i.e.  </s>
<s> These ... features will make your site... I'd remore the colon and make it an intro.  </s>
<s> Otherwise I like it (and "portable or slow devices", as Bill said, is shorter)  </s>
<s> I think we need to follow some priority order in this list.  </s>
<s> Link text is not a priority 1 on the PA document, it should come after ALT or FRAME.  </s>
<s> Please, no "Create text alternatives", it's ambiguous and we don't want people to think we ask them to double their number of pages.  </s>
<s> Really not important.  </s>
<s> I'd remove this one.  </s>
<s> Most if not all UAs support an "ignore author background/foreground" setting nowadays.  </s>
<s> Duplicate is a bad word :-) We want them to use ALT and client side image map, and if they can't, then a text version.  </s>
<s> Again, no asking for double page as a first order.  </s>
<s> "Avoid complex table or prepare a text-only..." is fine.  </s>
<s> Instead of "Make the raw data available.",  </s>
<s> I'd say "Provide a long description".  </s>
<s> In any case, I think this is too arcane for a business card and can be left out.  </s>
<s> Since TITLE or NAME can be used, I'd just say "Label each frame, and if too complex, provide a linear version in with NOFRAMES .  </s>
<s> Note that we can save on word/size by skipping attribute (this is an element in this case, not an attribute in fact)  </s>
<s> I'd move this one on structure right after ALT, as second top.  </s>
<s> Evaluate your accessibility is more personal.  </s>
<s> Can be shorten: I'd remove "without a mouse" which doesn't add much after mentioning the keyboard, and monochrome monitor.  </s>
<s> I'd add "use automated and text-only emulation tools".  </s>
<s> I like this short closing and the way it is presented on the card.  </s>
