4-Aug-2000 Tidy fails to tidy nested anchor elements. 
This bug has existed ever since the 24-Nov-1999 version, but it did not exist in the 26-Jul-1999 version. 
By a truly amazing coincidence (especially given how long this bug has existed), Bjoern Hoehrmann reported this same bug as I was preparing this message. 
The bug appears to be in parser.c's 
ParseInline() function which assumes that anchor elements are pushed on the istack. 
That was once a valid test but not any longer. 
I think the following change fixes it. 
Note that a second bug must also be fixed in the immediately following if statement (it must check for /a end tags) to prevent an infinite loop, something that the first bug had prevented from happening. 
(As is always the case for me, I verified the fix in Java and translated it to C, but I don't have a C compiler to verify the translation.) *** 1170,1181 **** an A tag to ends any open A element but A href=... is mapped to /A A href=... ! 
if (node- tag == tag_a &amp;&amp; !node- implicit &amp;&amp; IsPushed(lexer, node)) /* coerce a to /a unless it has some attributes */ ! 
if (node- attributes == null) node- type = EndTag; ReportWarning(lexer, element, node, COERCE_TO_ENDTAG); PopInline(lexer, node); --- 1170,1182 ---- an A tag to ends any open A element but A href=... is mapped to /A A href=... !

(element- tag == tag_a || DescendantOf(element, tag_a))) /* coerce a to /a unless it has some attributes */ ! 
if (node- type != 
EndTag &amp;&amp; node- attributes == null) node- type = EndTag; ReportWarning(lexer, element, node, COERCE_TO_ENDTAG); PopInline(lexer, node); ------------------------ Example HTML document ------------------------- Randy further testings showed: [_] a a [_] pre img [x] pre object [_] pre big [_] pre small [_] pre sub [_] pre sup [_] button input [_] button select [_] button textarea [_] button label [_] button button [x] button form [x] button fieldset [_] button iframe [x] button isindex [x] label label [x] form form [x] means tidy handles it "correctly".

Thanks for the patch, I tested it and it appears to work fine. 
I also dropped the PopInline since this is now longer needed now that Tidy doesn't push anchors onto the inline stack.
