Nearly two-thirds of disability World Wide Web sites were found to have accessibility problems, a recent analysis found. 
The study by the Gilbert Center checked the home pages of more than 100 disability organizations using the Bobby validation tool for accessibility. 
Is the standard for access so difficult or unclear that our own organizations cannot meet it?

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC The report does have shortcomings, which were thoroughly discussed when it was released earlier this year. 
Unfortunately, the above comments don't address the fact that even our own organizations can't seem to get this web access issue right. 
We can talk about the endless financial interest of the disability industrial complex and how some organizations may not have a full commitment to creating tools for accessibility and empowerment. 
However, we fail to analyze fully why our own organizations are not accessible in cyberspace when many of them would like to be.

no, my comments upon the shortcomings of the site analysis of sites sponsored by disability organizations does not redress the issue, as regards the accessibility of such sites... however, there are several simple steps that any disability or accessibility oriented organization can, and should, take: 1. any article that claims to deal with accessibility should, itself, be accessible, or state at the outset that -- due to restrictions placed upon the latitude of an individual author to ensure the accessibility of the document source used to encode the article, it may not be accessible, and may not utilize the authoring practices and markup described in the article 2. any disability related organization should contractually bind any contractor to construct sites that bear a relationship to the sponsoring organization to attain at least Double-A compliance to WCAG; likewise, any internally produced web pages should be designed so as to achieve at least Double-A compliance with WCAG 3. i have personally contacted nearly 75 disability related organizations, pointing out the problems posed by the markup and technologies used in/on their sites, providing them examples of specific problems, as well as solutions to redress the extant problems, and have been rebuffed by all but a handful the problem isn't that it is difficult to design for Double-A compliance, it is that it is not being done, nor is it being required by sponsoring organizations, whose members (not to mention those in whose name they collect money from the general public) rely on the practices outlined in WCAG in order to access web-based content... yes, we can certainly publicize WCAG and ER tools such as Bobby and A-Prompt more vociferously and actively, but it is ultimately up to the sponsoring organization to self-police its online presence... this is something that cannot be enforced from without, but is a change which needs to be effected from within the sponsoring organization... perhaps the most effective line of agit-prop in this instance would be to build a rogues' gallery of inaccessible sites sponsored by disability-related organizations... something along the lines of: but much more comprehensive, less blind-centric, and far less sarcastic... note: the sites that appear in the above-listed URI are sites which are (a) egregiously inaccessible and (b) have explicitly rebuffed my attempts to assist them in correcting the accessibility problems posed by their sites... note, as well, that this is far from a comprehensive list of such sites... gregory.
