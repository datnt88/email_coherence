I recently found that one of my local government depts. 
had revamped their web site, soI decided to check it out with Amaya 4.2.1. 
It seems to have discovered an amaya problem: Most of hte pages have no parse errors, however some show: *** Errors in file: /home/users/johnd/.amaya/1/index.shtml 
line 68, char 66: Panic: buffer overflow What does this mean?? 
This message is displayed by the transformation program. 
Did you request a structure transformation? 
Irene. 
Oops this message is also displayed when an attribute value is longer than 1000 characters. 
It's the case in your document. 
Irene.
