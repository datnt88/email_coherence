But the absolutely _wrong_ "default implementation plans" wedged into WCAG 1.0 ("Single A" "Double A" "Triple A") lead to the kind of "all or none" thinking displayed here, and eventually leads people to even worse policies such as 508. 
This is why we need to make WCAG 2.0 compliance a _toolkit_ for policy and not a set of _prebuilt_ policies!! 
I agree with your assessment, but not your solution. 
I think that one of the largest issues in fostering accessibility in organizations is the lack of a policy that holds water with respect to their makeup and goals. 
The accessibility efforts I've seen often have a single point of failure in the guidelines: that is, the stakeholders see something their site will not support without a substantial redesign process, and that's the end of accessibility. 
Or, like Gregg described, they seek legal shelter in a weaker standard. 
The problem with overreaching, in this respect, is the risk of under-grasping. 
While I'm not excited about the status quo, or with point-scoring schemes, I think that it would be reasonable to create accessibility profiles for different web site types (education, government, content, commerce, etc.), and declare for each group what the obstacles are and how to solve them. 
The needs of people using assistive technologies differ slightly in each area, which I think is partly responsible for complicating the prioritization process which no one here is all too eager to begin. 
I've mentioned before that many groups seek out Accessibility (with a capital A) like they would any other technology (e.g., JavaScript, Flash). 
My experience is that their interest declines sharply when they're told it's not that simple. 
I think our challenge is to _make_ it that simple. 
In the long term, that means making languages and tools that make accessibility a forcing function. 
For now, though, I think it's more important and productive to create rulesets that are tailored to the content provider, so that they no longer have such excuses as WCAG is too rigid, or such-and-such is unnecessary for their site. 
Stakeholders in accessibility decisions need to know why as much as they need to know how, and since that differs from site to site, our answers need to satisfy their questions. 
m Matt and Kynn, Studying the conformance scheme ideas .... 
I think when Kynn says he wants it to be flexible, he means with little or no conformance scheme - put out the guidelines and let everyone pick and choose what to follow? 
Such a scheme would lend itself to a variety of interpretations by policy-makers as well as by those who direct the web designers' work. 
The alternative is a priority scheme (which is the task this week) .... If we go with flexibility, how do we label the various guidelines so that intelligent choices can be made? 
Do we identify each checkpoint by identifying the characteristics/disabilities of the users serve? 
Do we estimate the numbers? 
Or should we do that internally? 
I'm thinking that if we created a matrix for internal use, we could look at it and start making some concrete decisions about what to do to move forward on defining a conformance scheme. 
We really do need a minimal conformance level, one that covers addresses all input and output variations and all major groups of persons with disabilities .... flexibility could apply above that level.

Hmmm The discussion of 508 as being weaker etc is somewhat troubling to me. 
It is less complete because it (for regulatory reasons) left out all cognitive -- and some other pieces. 
There are other things we learned from it to improve 2.0. 
And things we learned about weaknesses in 1.0 when they tried to use 1.0 in crafting 508. 
At this point let's just say that 2.0 had better be better than both of them when we get done with it - since we have the advantage of both 1.0 and 508 to learn from. 
Someday 508 will be revised. 
Let's see how good we can make 2.0 so we can get some additional convergence (and international harmonization) between the future 508 and the future 2.0.

I agree that there are differences, but I don't agree that this group -- which is not at all representative of those audiences -- should be the ones to issue guidelines for those groups. 
W3C should not be in the position of dictating requirements in areas for which we don't have the appropriate expertise to comment. 
Higher education web developers and policymakers should set educational web accessibility standards. 
Government web developers and policymakers should set government web accessibility standards. 
E-commerce web developers and policymakers should set e-commerce web accessibility standards. 
And so on. 
And they should do so using the WCAG 2.0 framework as a basis for setting those policies.

Issue, as a W3C note, a set of non-normative "example accessibility policies" after soliciting input from various site operator groups. 
Just don't make it a part of the official spec, which should be a toolkit.

To clarify a point, part of the reason that 508 is weak is because WCAG 1.0 was weak to begin with. 
If WCAG 1.0 had been stronger, 508 would have been stronger.

Despite being engaged in the process of coming up with a set of minimum conformance criteria I have a lot of sympathy for Kynn's view. 
My reasoning may be slightly different however. 
As stated in this post [1] which went unanswered, how much do we know about the difficulties disabled people have using the web? 
Do we know enough to create a set of minimum Guidelines which will effectively meet the needs of those (disabled web site users) for whom they are designed to benefit? 
Having bought the Nielsen Norman report and having skim read it I have been astounded by how relevant it is to what we are up to in this group. 
Can we afford to ignore it?

Kynn, I agree with your principle here. 
Each domain should set their own guidelines, but I choked over the notion of higher ed setting guidelines for K-12. 
The needs of the two levels of education are very different, especially as you approach the younger students. 
K-2 may need an illustration density of one illustration per 10 words, while higher ed could do nicely with an illustration per 100 words. 
The needs for educationally disabled folks (cognitive, learning, and reading difficulties) is somewhere between these extremes. 
Sadly, although some of us have struggled to keep good faith instead of hard numbers out of 3.4, it seems it will be necessary in order to include the affected folks at the supper table.

As a dumb question, could the W3C purchase a copy of the NN report for the purpose of making it available to members of this working group? 
There is a more expensive option available where you pay $400 instead of $200, but you're able to distribute electronic copies within your company or organization.

Agreed, I didn't mean to imply that I was defining normative (heh) chunking, but rather giving an example to illustrate that _we_ should not be the ones setting the standard for someone else. 
As it is now, that's pretty much like what we do now. 
:p If college admins aren't qualified to set accessibility requirements for 3rd graders, then it's even more clear that this tiny group of people on the working group is not qualified to decide on the needs for every audience out there.
