WAVE 2.0 is up and running at WAVE is an accessibility checker that focuses on helping humans make the myriad human judgments needed to properly judge accessibility, e.g. is ALT text appropriate for the image or area? 
Is reading order sensible? 
Are logical tags (Hx, UL, etc.) used appropriately? 
It also does some automatic checks. 
This version adds frames, ssl support, additional checks. 
Also features a WAVE button that you can drag to your browser's link bar. 
Clicking this button will send whatever page you happen to be browsing 
through the WAVE. 
You can then click through the site... provided the site 
doesn't get too fancy with javascript. 
So please tell me what you think.

Hi: 
What do you mean by: "provided the site doesn't get too fancy with 
JavaScript."? Thanks, Kathleen Anderson, Webmaster Office of the State Comptroller 55 Elm Street Hartford, CT 06106 e-mail: kathleen.anderson@po.state.ct.us URL: http://www.osc.state.ct.us/ URL ACCESS: http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/

I use Opera and don't want to find out what you mean. 
Please explain what a "link bar" is? 
Now I'll go look at WAVE 2.0 g .

Oh, there's a typo on the icon definition page (or you've coined a new word) "Alterative Applet" - should be "alternative" unless you mean an Applet that alters! 
My email spell checker didn't flag "alterative" so I posed it to an online dictionary - result: Dictionary has no entry for alterative Since earlier today I encountered "rain-runneled" I thought maybe this was a 2-new-words-in-the-vocabulary day. 
No such luck although I like "alterative" quite a bit. 
2.0 also makes me feel good about my "guideline guide" site which I'd like 
you to look at: http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm 
(any comments gratefully {and I hope gracefully} accepted).

If clicking on a button or link invokes javascript to get the next page, the WAVE doesn't follow that link. 
To get there you need to go to the page from the normal, un-waved site, and once you are at the page, click the "WAVE"button on your browser. 
Or, if you haven't put a wave button on your browser, type the URL of the page into the wave entry form.. There's a complication if the site also uses frames though. 
If javascript replaces just the contents of one frame, you have to open that frame in a new window, and then wave it via a button or the form.

Re Williams note 
Yes, in addition to showing the alt text next to the icons for checking, Wave 2.0 shows where William used structural markup (H1, H2, UL....), so we can see that the page uses real headings and lists instead of HTML that merely looks like headings and lists. 
And we can check that they are used the right way. 
These are things that can't be checked automatically... at least not until we have computerized pattern recognition and artificial intelligence with common sense. 
My only comment would be that people who aren't using screenreaders (or the WAVE) miss some information. 
E.g. that icon showing a sailor at the wheel 
has alt text "your navigator to the WCAG guidelines". 
A person who doesn't see the alt text doesn't know what that icon means. 
It true that if they put the mouse there the alt text pops up, but they might not put the mouse there, and if they have a motor disability they never wind up putting the mouse there (simply tabbing to a link doesn't pop up the alt text). 
Same comment for most of the other icons.

Another "feature" of Opera is that the ALT= is not displayed by hovering. 
So what's the non-invasive solution to this conundrum? 
Labeled Icons? 
D-links all over the place? 
A note at the top/bottom explaining that the icons are links and the "where" of their destinations?

William, There's now a way to add a Wave link to Opera, similar to the wave buttons on NN and MSIE. 
See http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/operasc.html 
It lets you browse to any page in opera... then you just select the Wave link off the "Lists" menu and it runs the page through the wave. 
Thanks for asking. 
That brings us up 1/100 of a release point to Wave 2.01. 
Now on to more items in the wish list.... Len

then you just select the Wave link off the "Lists" menu 
What is the "Lists" menu? 
I can't follow the referenced "how-to"!

The Opera I'm looking at has the following menus across the top 
File Edit View Navigation Lists Mail News Preferences Window Help Thats opera 3.62 (I gotta get around to updating) Is it different on yours?

then you just select the Wave link off the "Lists" menu

Yep. I've got 4.02 and the menu bar is: file edit view navigation bookmarks email news windows help 
Bookmarks is the equivalent of "lists."

It sure doesn't look like Len's screen shot. 
Nothing about "link documents".

William, I updated the text Opera instructions (the screenshot still shows opera 3.62 but the description of how to add a Wave link to opera reflects version 4). 
This is a javscript link: if you browse to a page the usual way in Opera then simply selecting the link should run your page thru the Wave. 
Please tell me if it's working for you now.

Nope. 
It provides a bookmark to the WAVE test of the page that the "button" was pressed on. 
Going to another site and selecting that bookmark simply displays the WAVE analysis of itself. 
Sorry. 
Love.
