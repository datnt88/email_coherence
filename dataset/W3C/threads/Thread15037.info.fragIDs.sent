<s> Since this one keeps coming up in our conversations, I thought I'd go ahead and add an issue to our issues list and put forth a proposal for it... Issue #285 [1] suggests that given the May 2003 restructuring changes and the move toward the use of core and extended checkpoints, the name "Core Techniques" has the potential to create some confusion.  </s>
<s> I propose that we change "Core Techniques" to "Cross-Technology Techniques."  </s>

<s> I do not have a better term in mind but thought we were to have gone away and come up with other possibilities.  </s>
