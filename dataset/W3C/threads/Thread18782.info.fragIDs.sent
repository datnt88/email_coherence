<s> Most action items have found takers.  </s>
<s> Here's the list with names.  </s>
<s> - Cougar: W3C (myself and Arnaud Le Hors - this one also includes topics such as ABBREV and ACRONYM that were discussed recently) - LongDesc: Mike Paciello and George Kersher (Larry Goldberg from WGBH is also interested)  </s>
<s> - ICADD: DanielD (really a report that Murray Maloney sent us a while ago)  </s>
<s> - Phonetic: Harvey Bingham (I know Dave Raggett and Kevin Schofield from Microsoft are also interested in this one)  </s>
<s> - ACSS: Al Gilman  </s>
<s> - DOM: [still looking for someone, but since DOM is just starting, that can wait a little more] - XML: Mike and Georges  </s>
<s> - MATH: Probably Dave Raggett - HTTP: Javier Roma?ach (details at Since some of you asked to work on the same topic, I highly encourage to start discussion and send draft requirements and proposal document early on this list.  </s>
<s> The output of our work is going to feed both to the various W3C working groups (HTML/CSS/DOM/MATH/XML/HTTP) and our own work on guidelines.  </s>
<s> My skills include tables accessibility (I think an action item there is appropriate, that I'd like to head), XML, ICADD, DSSSL, and the XS XML-Style work.  </s>
<s> The tables work could remain under ICADD.  </s>
<s> Murray Altheim should be here, as he made a major attempt while at Spyglass.  </s>
<s> So should Murray Maloney.  </s>
<s> Dan: this is not an area where I have any competence.  </s>
<s> Folks who do include: Jim Fruchterman jim@arkenstone.org  </s>
<s> Alexander Caskey afc@halcyon.com  </s>
<s> I contacted Alexander, who indicated he'd like to help.  </s>
<s> He will be subscribing and following up.  </s>
<s> How about T.V.Raman there?  </s>
<s> I have been working XML, Who is Georges?  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> Sorry Harvey and Jim (Fruchterman), I mixed up your names somehow.  </s>
<s> OK for a new item, although I think it should be under Cougar review.  </s>
<s> I'll talk to MurraA.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the mix-up, it's Jim that wrote me and the list about this one, not you.  </s>
<s> I'll write down Alexander too.  </s>
<s> T.V contacted me since I posted this message, and he's willing to work on this one too (and the following).  </s>
<s> Kersher.  </s>
<s> - MATH: Probably Dave Raggett=20  </s>
<s> And T.V.  </s>
<s> Daniel, Harvey: What is the status of work on tables?  </s>
<s> Since I think that this is the current point-of-pain that carries with it the toughest technical challenges, I would probably tilt toward a separate work area for it.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
