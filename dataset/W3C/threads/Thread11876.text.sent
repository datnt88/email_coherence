4.3 Allow the author to override any removal of unrecognized markup. 
[Priority 2] Can 4.3 be reworded so as not to be perceived as inconsistent with 2.1 and 2.2? Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns

thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 I agree with Jim that 4.3 could be written clearer. 
My proposed wording: 4.3 Allow the author to over ride the tool's removal of unrecognized accessible markup. 
[Priority 2] Notes: 1. 
The author may have included or imported markup that is not recognized by the tool, but which enhances accessibility as determined by the author. 
2. Author over ride need not be the tool's default setting. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins I agree that we need to make it clear that the user has the power of override. 
However the thesis of 4.3 is that the tool doesn't know that it is trying to remove something taht is there for accessibility. 
Perhaps we should cross-reference 4.3 from guideline 2. Charles McCN I agree with Jim that 4.3 could be written clearer.
