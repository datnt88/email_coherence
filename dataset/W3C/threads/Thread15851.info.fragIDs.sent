<s> Won't you run into support of VB Script issues by different browsers?  </s>
<s> I think you would want to stick to straight HTML.  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that most user agents are capable of handling HTML generated forms.  </s>

<s> HTML forms are accessible for nearly all browsers (assuming the brrowser is reasonably accessible in the first place).  </s>
<s> VB Script is not.  </s>
<s> Not even nearly.  </s>
<s> But the answer would involve using something other than FP it seems, or drawing up your page in FP and then fixing it using Notepad or something.  </s>
<s> This seems to be a standard thing in accessible design - until the tools are a LOT better, learning HTML is at some level pretty necessary.  </s>
<s> Lucky it's pretty simple.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> Chuck said 'Whoa, hang on a minute...' So I'd better clarify... VB (and Javascript and Java) are far from universally supported.  </s>
<s> This provides an accessibility problem even before considering what is actually done.  </s>
<s> Chuck is quite right - using HTML to write a form is not a guarantee that it will be accessible, but it is a step towards being more certain.  </s>
<s> There are a whole raft of issues that need to be considered, but the point was that by relying on scripts inside pages there will be a raft of users locked out by the technology.  </s>
<s> My comments were not meant to stand as a guide to what makes stuff accessible, but were just a response to what immediately struck me as the biggest accessiblity concern in the approach outlined.  </s>
<s> Detailed explanations available on application - but I guess this disclaimer is a bit late.  </s>
<s> cheers Charles  </s>
<s> Whoa! VBScript, as JavaScript or JScript only provides behavior on top of HTML - the accessibility of a page is not affected by the presence, or lack of scripting.  </s>
<s> Sure, I can create an inaccessible HTML page with scripts, I can do it without scripts too.  </s>
<s> VBScript is only a language - it's not user interface.  </s>
<s> The form controls are exactly the same.  </s>

<s> As Charles McCathieNevile noted, forms are already accessible in most of the modern browsers (Netscape 1.0 up and IE 3.0 up - just out of curiosity, were there any IE browsers prior to 3.0?).  </s>
<s> For the browsers that don't recognize forms (I'm not familiar with them, but I know they exist), the most viable solution would be to provide and e-mail address to send the information too.  </s>
<s> A note can be included in the form instructions to this effect.  </s>
<s> Whether the form appears in the browser or not, the names of the fields you've coded in straight HTML text will appear.  </s>
<s> That way, the user will know what information is being collected and can send this info via e-mail.  </s>
<s> I don't use FrontPage to code HTML.  </s>
<s> I mostly code using a text editor.  </s>
<s> I have recently started using Allaire Home Site to do some of the grunt work and Dreamweaver has done wonders as well.  </s>
<s> Your message seems to indicate that you haven't included forms in your site before and you haven't developed scripts to process the information gathered in the form.  </s>
<s> Consequently, I would recommend doing some reading on both form creation and scripts to process the data (CGI primarily).  </s>
<s> I would suggest you start at: page covers using CGI to e-mail information collected through a form.  </s>
<s> You'll probably want to check out Matt's Script Archive (FormMail) to get info on this.  </s>
<s> The address is: http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/ Good luck and let us know if you need more guidance.  </s>

<s> Facsimile  </s>
<s> Yes, there is an MSIE 2 (I use it reasonably often because it is nice and small), and it does work with forms.  </s>
<s> Actually I assume there is an MSIE 1 as well, but I have never heard of it.  </s>
<s> But then I never heard of DOS 1 - the oldest versions I new of were 2.11 and Apple DOS 3.2 Forms run through CGI scripts are almost universally supported (except they can't be put onto CD's without a lot of work).  </s>
<s> I think the ISINDEX thing is older, but the experts would have to confirm that.  </s>
