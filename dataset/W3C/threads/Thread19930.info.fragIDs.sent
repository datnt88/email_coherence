<s> Hi, I have just installed Amaya 2.4 and the following problems came up: 1.  </s>
<s> The following MathML code is not interpretted correctly: b Theorem (Brouwer) /b i Let be an orientation preserving homeomorphism which possesses a periodic point p which is not a fixed point.  </s>
<s> Then f has a fixed point of positive index.  </s>
<s> /i /body.  </s>
<s> I get the question sign (?) in place where there should be an arrow (- , coded in MathML with "&amp;to").  </s>
<s> There are other symbols which also not displayed, or rather replaced by "?", like &amp;ldots (three dots), &amp;emptyset, &amp;leq (less or equal), &amp;neq (not equal), &amp;geq (greater or equal).  </s>
<s> 2. When I link to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/ none of the links, neither the search button work.  </s>
<s> can you comment please?  </s>
<s> Regards Andrzej Dr. Andrzej Pindor The foolish reject what they see and University of Toronto not what they think; the wise reject Information Commons what they think and not what they see.  </s>

<s> 1. In the current version, Amaya uses only the Symbol font in addition to ISO-Latin1 fonts.  </s>
<s> For this reason, a number of mathematical symbols  </s>
<s> can't be displayed properly.  </s>
<s> They appear in the form of a question mark.  </s>
<s> But, don't worry, if you save the document, the original entity is preserved.  </s>
<s> We are well aware of this limitation and will do our best to improve the situation in future releases.  </s>
<s> 2. I am not sure I understand your second point.  </s>
<s> If you are talking about the AltaVista search form, the issue is that this HTML page in completely screwed up.  </s>
<s> If you submit it to an HTML validator, you will see a number of errors.  </s>
<s> Amaya has some problems with such pages, and in this particular case, it misses the FORM tag (look at the Structure view: this tag is displayed in red, which means that it has not been interpreted), and the form can't work.  </s>
<s> I have reported the error to people in charge of the server.  </s>

<s> Any plans on supporting Unicode and/or UTF-8 encoding in the near future?  </s>

<s> There are very few Unicode encoded fonts, and I doubt there are any UTF-8 encoded fonts; it wouldn't surprise me if Amaya is Unicode internally, but that doesn't help if you are running on Windows 98 with the only Unicode fonts being CJK.  </s>

<s> Yes we plan to release an Alpha Unicode version of Amaya in March or April.  </s>
<s> Amaya will be able to read UTF-8 or Iso-Latin files.  </s>
<s> Of course we will need specific fonts to display non Iso-Latin characters.  </s>

<s> I wish this were also the case with numeric character references (NCRs).  </s>
<s> If you load a file containing, say, &amp;#338; (an OE ligature), Amaya will nicely determine that it cannot display that and display OE as a fallback instead.  </s>
<s> That's OK, but when you save, you'll find that the file now contains "OE", not your original &amp;#338;.  </s>
<s> Without even as much as a warning, I think this is, hmmm, impolite and should be fixed.  </s>

<s> Yes, it's true for all entities.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> This bug has been fixed.  </s>
<s> Amaya now saves the original character reference back, even if it can't display it properly.  </s>
<s> The fix is available in the CVS base and will be included in the next binary release.  </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing this out.  </s>
