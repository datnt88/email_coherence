<s> At http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/02/xhtml-rdf.html is a discussion document about XHTML and RDF from the HTML working group.  </s>
<s> The aim is to be able to generate RDF triples from XHTML, be GRDDL compatible, allow XHTML documents to validate, and offer authors the ability to add semantic information to their documents without the need for HTML to be continually extended with new semantic elements such as person or number etc.  </s>
<s> Comments welcome.  </s>

<s> I've had a read through and I like the approach; I recall this being outlined last year.  </s>
<s> It is analgous to the rdf/xml style of a 'frame' of properties about a single subject.  </s>
<s> Here the meta stands for the frame of subjects about the doc, and the inner meta are the properties.  </s>
<s> So where I had this example in the RDF/XML syntax doc: It would become (if embedded in http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar): (I assume an implicit 'about this document' applies) I could probably translate more of those examples into this form.  </s>
<s> meta inside a meta always implies a blank node in between, never one with a URI, correct?  </s>
<s> Looking at the above, using both rel and property attributes with qname attributes values on the link and meta elements respectively does not look like it'll be something people will remember.  </s>

<s> Interesting work.  </s>
<s> I think it does compliment GRDDL.  </s>
<s> My reading of this is that it, in effect, consists of a proposal for an alternate XML encoding for RDF graphs (or perhaps, for some subset of RDF graphs).  </s>
<s> This syntax is motivated by issues from the RDF-in-XHTML world, but the encoding could presumably be used in other contexts.  </s>
<s> The main features of the syntax are (i) XML regularity: elements/attributes are predicatable in advance; terms from misc RDF vocabs appear only as content; (ii) extreme simplicity of parsing vs perceived expense of full RDF.  </s>
<s> Is that a fair characterisation of what you're trying to do here?  </s>
<s> re subset, I guess this syntax doesn't deal with bNode-heavy graphs that have loops in, and I don't think (from quick skim) it handles RDF datatyping.  </s>
<s> Is the intention to offer a complete encoding for arbitrary RDF graphs or just capture a commonly useful subset?  </s>
