Hi people, Could someone explain me why DOMStringList interface has no appendString() or insertString() method? 
Without that, DOMStringList is useful only as a method's return value and can't really be built to serve as a parameter. 
DOMStringList was designed to fulfill the needs of DOMConfiguration.parameternames and NodeEditVal.enumeratedValues. 
We had no reason to add appendString or insertString since the attributes are readonly. 
Philippe The CSS WG is working on the CSS Editing Object Model that reuses DOMStringList as a return argument of a new method querying classes or IDs "defined" in a given stylesheet or stylerule. 
That would be very cool to allow the calling code to merge DOMStringLists without having to "clone" them into an Array with an expensive chunk of code. 
I see nothign preventing the CSS WG from extending the DOMStringList interface to something that is a mutable list of strings, i.e. create a new interface that inherits DOMStringList and add the methods you need... jst
