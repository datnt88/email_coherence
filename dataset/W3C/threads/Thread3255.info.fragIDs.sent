<s> How do we deal with sites like this?  </s>
<s> Does anyone want to take the lead in contacting them and asking them to produce valid XHTML.  </s>
<s> I would love to a) hear their response and b) see the site corrected.  </s>
<s> /bc  </s>
<s> I'd like to contact them.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that ~98% of those validation errors are from bare ampersands.  </s>
<s> Should be easy to correct, especially if I also point them to Tidy.  </s>
<s> Sue  </s>
<s> Sue, Thanks!  </s>
<s> Although most of the reported errors are due to the use of ampersands in URLs, there is a mixture of other issues involved here.  </s>
<s> This is a news site with it's own content management system and teams of authors/editors.  </s>
<s> Getting them to change the way they do business is more than having them run tidy over a single document.  </s>
<s> The errors which are not due to the use of ampersands range from missing endtags, to improper case, to missing quotes on attributes, to improperly placed elements.  </s>
<s> (Not to mention the use of SGML comments surrounding the inline script) In fact, this document is HTML tag soup and not even close to XHTML at all.  </s>
<s> To get them to fix the issue in general will take some effort on their part to change the way content is authored and published.  </s>
<s> Good Luck and let us know what they say.  </s>
<s> /bc  </s>
<s> It's not very likely that I'll get a response.  </s>
<s> I used their web form for feedback.  </s>

<s> We need to demonstrate some business reasons for retrofitting compliant XHTML in there, future development is an easier sell, but retrofitting a site which is "working" is much harder.  </s>
<s> I'm sure they have some QA process which checks that the site works in UA's, and it probably mostly does.  </s>
<s> As you say later, getting the process changed is going to be difficult, I think the fact they've moved to XHTML shows they've either been fooled by bandwagons and just stuck some boilerplate gibberish there, or are actually caring and trying to move to a standardised language.  </s>
<s> For me we shouln't encourage invalid XHTML - if it's going to be invalid it's much better it's HTML.  </s>
<s> The only chance UA's have of optimising for valid content is if they can recognise when it's likely to come.  </s>
<s> So, I think we should only advocate XHTML if the person is willing to go the whole hog and actually have a publishing process which ensures validity (something like Nick Kew's apache modules on the front) the risks of invalid XHTML served as application/xhtml+xml make it a very hard sell - make one mistake in your authoring and your content isn't available?  </s>
<s> So on these large sites we need to demonstrate a CMS system that can ensure validity, beyond transcoding modules such as Nick's, are there any CMS's that do this?  </s>
<s> Invalid HTML is safer, there's a de-facto standard in tag-soup error correction, so if the CMS has a bug, the site doesn't disappear until it's fixed, so for this it's safer to advocate HTML 4.01, that also helps with  </s>
<s> missing closing tags etc. (although not he entities problem) as they're inserted - even if it won't be what the author intended.  </s>
<s> Either way, I can't see how to sell any retrofitting activity can be sold to the site, where's the business value?  </s>
<s> I think we should concentrate on the ones we can win.  </s>
<s> Although, it may not be completely impossible with news.com.com, as they do support RSS, and it's valid, so some parts of their CMS is valid XML.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> hi people, i have a question, if i have etc... etc... in XSL can i get all values of all items and subitems?  </s>
<s> I use PHP as an example, but, i just can get this values using the PHP language (making an array parser), not the XSL language.  </s>
<s> This is possible to do with XSL? Thanks  </s>

<s> if you know your output template it might be easy to ouput it in XHTML, another XML language, RSS 1.0 feed, etc and even text only file.  </s>
