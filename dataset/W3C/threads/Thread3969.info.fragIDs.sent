<s> Dear all, I had some talks with Massimo and Mark Nottingham here at the TP in Cannes.  </s>
<s> I have interesting conclusions but I don't have a clue yet how to formulate that in the specification.  </s>
<s> 1/ Discussion with Mark Nottingham I discussed the attribute with Mark and the most important remark he made was, that there is a very fundamental distinction between applying the p3p-attribute on data contained in the element being send over the wire and an interface description (like WSDL[1]).  </s>
<s> Mark suggests that we only treat interfaces for the moment and defer the data-sending to later (epal?) work.  </s>
<s> 2/ Discussion with Massimo Before and after having talked to Mark, I've talked a lot with Massimo.  </s>
<s> I found out that Massimo's but also Lorrie's approach correspond to what Mark calls the data approach.  </s>
<s> In fact, they assume that data is contained in the element foo xsd:p3patt="p3p.xml"  </s>
<s> bar Rigo /bar /foo Now they claim that not anybody will treat that chunk of XML the way as defined in p3p.xml when foo... is send over the wire.  </s>
<s> But this makes the protocol assumption underlying to cc/pp and is the flip-side of P3P.  </s>
<s> In fact it makes the protocol assumption that the policy is sent with the data and constrains the recipient of that data.  </s>
<s> This, in terms of P3P, is not possible, as it would mean one is sending privacy preferences over the wire.  </s>
<s> We don't do that and it has complete different semantics.  </s>
<s> So the only thing we know to do today is, that if I receive -say- a WSDL interface description with a p3p-attribute on it, I know that when submitting data to that interface, my data will be treated in the way described in the P3P policy.  </s>
<s> If sending data over the wire, it is like sending preferences (like cc/pp does).  </s>
<s> Once we agreed on this, Massimo had no concerns anymore.  </s>
<s> The issue is now to find a language to constrain our attribute so that it could only apply to interfaces and not to data send over the wire.  </s>
<s> We will probably also need some words to avoid the misunderstanding described above (sending data over the wire) as it is most common or even the preferred interpretation of most people.  </s>
<s> I hope this might help Lorrie in drafting her proposal.  </s>

<s> OK, I like the distinction between interface description and data.  </s>
<s> I know very little about WSDL and other languages for writing interface descriptions... would an interface description include some reference to a particular entity or URI where the interface will be processed (not sure if that's the right word)?  </s>
<s> I guess what I'm wondering is whether there could still be a problem that a chunk of XML describing an interface might be processed by multiple entities, including entities that the one who wrote it is unaware of (and thus can't anticipate when writing the P3P policy).  </s>
<s> Lorrie  </s>
<s> Lorrie, the issue is that WSDL is using SOAP and qnames and like in the forms context, several things can be sent to several URIs and there are intermediaries.  </s>
<s> So yes, some things have URIs and some don't.  </s>
<s> It is a simple question of granularity and complexity like in XForms.  </s>
<s> If you can match a small chunk (field for XForms, interface for WSDL) to a P3P Policy, policy writing gets much easier, matching of functionality (required/opt in/out) will be easier etc...  </s>
<s> That's why I'm pushing so hard on the granularity.  </s>
<s> It will solve a lot of issues.  </s>
<s> For the data in a chunk of XML that is transferred, this can only be solved with a concept like EPAL.  </s>
<s> (or a major revision of P3P).  </s>
<s> Applying policy to data instead of interfaces is the ultimate level of granularity.  </s>
<s> Best, Rigo  </s>
