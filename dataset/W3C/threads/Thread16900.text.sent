Many of the guidelines, checklists, and validation tools mention that you should not only validate by using an automated tool, but also using manual validation by people with disabilities. 
I thoroughly searched the WAI website but could not find anything on how and / or where to do that. 
I sometimes see request of webpage authors on this list if someone can have at look at their site, but I wonder if this list is the place for such requests. 
Just imagine that accessibility becomes a well known issue amongst web authors, then a couple of hundred maybe thousands of such requests would be posted here. 
Microsoft products are susceptible to a large variety of viruses, worms, and other fauna. 
There are two issues here. 
One is the need for manual validation, and the other who should do it. 
It is impossible to automatically validate for accessibility, so manual validation is always needed. 
People with disabilities are likely to understand specific issues better than those without. 
And the third is what resources are available to do it. 
If you have a blind person, do you equip them with expensive top-of-the-range kit that can do things like "accessible" flash, or something affordable to real-life users? 
A sweeping generalisation:-) This is true, particularly where you are presenting complex information. 
But those of us who don't have representatives from a broad range of disability groups amongst our colleagues have to make do with second-best. 
IMO a pretty good target is a three-level approach: (1) Automatic testing with Site Valet (2) Does it work as linearised text - e.g. view in in Lynx (3) Provide a prominent and accessible feedback option for people to raise any issues that remain in spite of your best efforts. 
Make sure someone is tasked with dealing with such feedback!
