EOWG folks, 
list I started a significant rewrite of the social factors page. 
The main motivation for the rewrite is to more closely align with the goals and audience for the Presenting the Case resource suite (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#about), which focuses on a "business" perspective. 
- new draft: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc-new.html --- previous version: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html --- version before last major rewrite (from March 2003): - changelog sections from 2 most recent discussions: --- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#20030801 --- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#20030716 
At the teleconference, I would like to talk about if this is going in a good direction. 
* How does this general approach work? 
* Does it address issues from the "business" perspective ? 
* Does it provide the information relevant to a "business" case? 
* Does it cover the broad idea of social factors as well as the specific idea of corporate social responsibility (as requested in previous discussion) ? 
* Is it "tangible" (as requested in previous discussion) ? 
* Is it the right amount of detail? 
Too much? 
Too little? 
* Are the important points covered appropriately? 
Is anything missing? 
Is something there that doesn't belong? 
Looking forward to your input!
