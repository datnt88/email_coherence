<s> The Authorization Request Header response = "response" "=" request-digest Later there's this text: The definition of request-digest above indicates the encoding for its value.  </s>
<s> The following definitions show how the value is computed.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there *is* no "definition ... above".  </s>
<s> The non-terminal request-digest has no syntactic definition.  </s>
<s> I suspect it should be request-digest = " *LHEX "  </s>
<s> 3.2.3  </s>
<s> The Authentication-Info Header cnonce and qop are used in the calculation of response-digest.  </s>
<s> The client is not required to send either cnonce= or auth=.  </s>
<s> So I assume (correct?) that the null string is used for values for omitted attributes in the calculation.  </s>
<s> If (to use cnonce as the example) cnonce was omitted, should Authentication-Info omit cnonce, or should it send cnonce=""?  </s>
<s> Same question for auth.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> It might be better to say that Authentication-Info should only be sent if qop (and hence cnonce) are present.  </s>
<s> Another question: Unless I am mistaken, at one point in the long sequence of digest drafts, the Authentication-Info header could be supplied by either the server or the client.  </s>
<s> It would be useful for the client to be able to supply the digest of POSTed data or a file which is PUT.  </s>
<s> Being able to assure the integrity of client supplied data would be very useful.  </s>
<s> Did this fall through the cracks, or am I just missing this functionality somewhere in the draft?  </s>

<s> But cnonce is not required, even when qop is specified.  </s>
<s> Only nonce-count is required.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> There does not seem to be a way for the client to send a digest of the entity-body.  </s>
<s> If it could, though, there's an ambiguity about qop=auth-int:  </s>
<s> 1) C -S HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: ... qop="auth,auth-int", ... 2) C- S (speculative) POST /some/entity HTTP/1.1 Host: blah Authorization: ... qop=auth-int, ... Authentication-Info: reqauth= some suitable digest , ... 3) C -S (problematic) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Authentication-Info: qop=auth-int, rspauth= entity digest The problem is that the client chose (this is speculative -- the spec.  </s>
<s> doesn't read this way) "auth-int", in order to send an entity digest.  </s>
<s> But the server is obliged to respond in kind, which means it must do a digest of what is probably not a very interesting response.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> It is in the Authorization header now.  </s>
<s> In section 3.2.2, it says: ] request-digest = "  KD ( H(A1), unq(nonce-value) ] ":" nc-value ] ":" unq(cnonce-value) ] ":" unq(qop-value) ] ":" H(A2) ] ) " ] If the "qop" directive's value is "auth" or is unspecified, then A2 is: ] A2 = Method ":" digest-uri-value  </s>
<s> ] If the "qop" value is "auth-int", then A2 is:  </s>
<s> ] A2 = Method ":" digest-uri-value ":" H(entity-body) So A2 in the response digest (poor name, that, because it is the response to the challenge, but it appears in a request) contains the hash of the body.  </s>
<s> That way we don't need another header.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that we specified that this may appear in a trailer, though.  </s>
<s> I think this is an oversight.  </s>
<s> I suspect the intent was that cnonce MUST be supplied if qop is.  </s>
<s> Actually Scott Lawrence straightened me out about this.  </s>
<s> The client's POSTed or PUT data must be MD5 digested if qop="auth-int".  </s>
<s> The digest result is part or the response digest.  </s>
<s> It is included in "A2" in the case that qop="auth-int".  </s>
<s> Actually I think the spec DOES read this way and the server is required to respond with a digest of what may be an uninteresting response.  </s>
<s> The choice is not entirely with the client.  </s>
<s> The server may only offer one of "auth" or "auth-int".  </s>
<s> But if it offers both the client gets to pick and the server must digest its response.  </s>
