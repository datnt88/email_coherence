Has anyone developed a means of representing automatically numbered footnotes in HTML? 
Currently, it is possible to represent footnotes using 
anchors, as in: [...] Text before footnote. 
a name=txt1 href="#fn1" [1] /a and at the end of the document: a name=fn1 href="#txt1" [1] /a Footnote text. 
The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires the author of the document to specify all of the footnote numbers explicitly, and to renumber subsequent notes if a new note is inserted into the text. 
Also, the footnotes appear as end notes rather than as actual footnotes. 
Undoubtedly, authoring software could handle the renumbering if it were designed to do so, but if the document is being typed directly into a text editor or the authoring tool does not specifically support a convention for representing footnotes such as that described above, then an alternative means is necessary. 
This issue would presumably be of importance in the ICADD work, given the intention to use HTML as the basis for the production of academic and technical materials for people with print disabilities. 
I have also noticed a substantial number of documents on the web which make use of footnotes (anchors are used as in the above example). 
Has a better solution to this problem been proposed, and is there any interest in developing one? 
Numbering is being worked on by the CSS &amp; Formatting Properties working group. 
I don't think they are considering foot notes though.

The problem of notes in general (whether they be side notes, footnotes or end notes) is both a markup issue and a style problem. 
There should be a mechanism by which one can indicate the presence of a note and leave such formatting details as the note marker (whether it be a number, an asterisk or another character) and the positioning of the text of the note to be controlled by style properties. 
I have not been able to find any element for indicating the presence of a note in the "element index" of the HTML 4.0 draft. 
Perhaps one could use an empty anchor element for this purpose, although this is obviously not an elegant solution: a name=txt1 href="#fn1" class="footnote" /a (and the style properties would have to insert the note number into the text at that point). 
HTML 3.0 included a NOTE element for this, but this feature wasn't considered sufficiently valuable by vendors. 
One possibility within the scope for HTML 4.0 is to subclass a DIV or P element and then to use style sheets to determine the placement of the element's content. 
You can also mark the relationship between a source anchor and the DIV or P element using the REL attribute, e.g. Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org
