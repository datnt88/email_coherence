<s> We have been checking Beta 1 of our (DSTC) implementation against the interop matrix and merlin-xmldsig-{fifteen,sixteen}.  </s>
<s> My understanding was that some of these documents should *not* verify, because they have URIs that use id() functionality but the documents do not have DTDs that specify the relevant attributes with type ID.  </s>
<s> However, the interop matrix shows that everyone else has happily verified these signatures (and so have we, but only by implementing something that I think is a hack).  </s>
<s> So: - does my understanding need fixing?  </s>
<s> (an all too common event) - has everyone taken a pragmatic approach and implemented the moral equivalent of the example in the XPointer spec?  </s>
<s> (i.e. the last thing in section 4.3, immediately above section 5; I'm not game to try writing a more accurate XPointer for it) - is there some other option that I should have realized?  </s>
<s> Thomas Maslen DSTC (By the way, merlin-xmldsig-sixteen was just wonderful for fingering bugs in my comment-filtering code -- blessings be upon Merlin H).  </s>
<s> Thomas,  </s>
<s> Actually an id() function is used two times within the signature of merlins "sixteen" suite: * id('notaries') ... In this case the element is found since the type of the attribute "Id" of the element "Notaries" is declared in the internal subset of the DTD.  </s>
<s> * id('object-3') ... In our implementation we validate the Signature element to be verified against the Schema grammar specified in the XML-Signature specification.  </s>
<s> So the type of the attribute "Id" of the element "Object" is recognized.  </s>

<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Fair enough, good idea.  </s>
<s> I was also thinking of the barename XPointers ("#object-3") that implicitly use id() semantics too (except for the discarding of comments) -- but your approach also covers all the examples of barename URIs in both -fifteen and -sixteen.  </s>
<s> I had it in mind that there were also examples of enveloped or same-document detached signatures that used fragment IDs, but that must have been a figment of my imagination.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Thomas Maslen DSTC  </s>
