<s> 1.1 Overview Considering this passage: "The DOM Level 3 Event module is backward compatible with the DOM Level 2 Events [DOM Level 2 Events] module, i.e. a DOM Level 3 Events implementation who returns true for "Events" with the version number "3.0" must also return true for this feature when the version number is "2.0", "" or, null." 'a DOM Level 3 Events implementation who returns true for "Events" with the version number "3.0" must also return true for this feature when the version number is "2.0", "" or, null."' = a DOM Level 3 Events implementation where hasFeature("Events", "3.0") returns true must also return true when the version number is "2.0", "" or, null.  </s>
<s> (This text occurs often, so this comment applies to all occurrences) However, is this really a definition of "backwards compatible"?  </s>
<s> My definition of backwards compatible is the other way round: if version N has a feature then version N+1 has it too, but not the other way round.  </s>
<s> If every feature in version N+1 is also in version N, then version N+1 must only fix errors, and have no new functionality.  </s>

<s> Make this the mirror of the definition for capturing: The process by which an event can be handled by one of the event target's ancestors after being handled by the event target.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't "event target" be defined here?  </s>
<s> 1.1.2 XML Namespaces Delete "as proposed by XML Events" "associated to a namespace" = associated with a namespace "Note that because the DOM does no lexical checking, the empty string will be treated as a real namespace URI in DOM Level 2 Events methods."  </s>
<s> Shouldn't that be "Level 3"?  </s>
<s> I don't understand this sentence, because I don't understand what "does no lexical checking" means.  </s>
<s> "Issue XMLEvents-1: XML Events renamed DOMFocusIn, DOMFocusOut, and DOMActivate."  </s>

<s> We went back to your naming.  </s>
<s> "Issue XMLEvents-2: XML Events is based on DOM Level 2 Events, not DOM Level 3 Events."  </s>
<s> This is still an issue.  </s>
<s> We need to make sure that we can properly handle DOM3 and DOM2 with the same markup.  </s>
<s> i.e. we want to behave the same on DOM2 and 3 and similarly.  </s>
<s> The second one is easy I think.  </s>
<s> The first one is hard, which is why we don't mention it in the most recent XML Events.  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Group/2002/WD-xml-events-20020722/).  </s>
<s> Ideas?  </s>
<s> "For instance, removeEventListenerNS remove the event that addEventListenerNS add.": removes "all event listener that match the type": listeners 1.2 Description of event flow This is *extremely* difficult to read and understand.  </s>
<s> I think there are a number of reasons: - "EventTarget" and "event target" are different concepts.  </s>
<s> The confusion is so great that I think the text uses "EventTarget" in several places where "event target" is actually meant, and vice versa.  </s>
<s> For instance "It can be handled locally at the EventTarget level or centrally from an EventTarget higher in the document tree."  </s>
<s> I believe that if you replace "EventTarget level" with "event target" that this sentence actually becomes understandable!  </s>
<s> I realise that this mess is now hard to undo, since the type EventTarget exists, as does the attribute 'target', but on the other hand, you don't have to let it show through in this text!  </s>
<s> Why not refer to 'event nodes' which is any node in the tree you can hang a listener on (as represented by the type EventTarget), and 'event target' which is the event node that the event has been dispatched to?  </s>
<s> - The description does not follow the actual flow, but jumps around, making it hard to follow.  </s>
<s> - Concepts have not been properly factored out.  </s>
<s> For instance, according to the text, EventListeners can only call stopPropagation during capture and bubbling, but not on the target itself.  </s>
<s> I'm sure that this is not intended.  </s>
<s> stopPropagation should be a separate section like cancellation is, to avoid this sort of mistake.  </s>
<s> - Parts of the description are defined in terms of things that are never defined.  </s>
<s> For instance "Events which are designated as bubbling will initially proceed with the same event flow as non-bubbling events.  </s>
<s> " though nowhere is defined what the event flow is for non-bubbling events.  </s>
<s> [[As a side issue: it would be great if you included text to event designers on how to determine if an event should bubble or not, or be cancelable or not.  </s>
<s> I noticed in the Forms working group that there was a lot of brain-aching going on trying to work it out.  </s>
<s> You'll probably say "but that's simple: ....", and that's exactly why you should write it down!]]  </s>
<s> So as a conclusion I would respectfully ask that this section be rewritten, along these lines:  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> There are two types of event: bubbling and non-bubbling.  </s>
<s> An event is dispatched to a 'target' node, and travels through the tree in three phases: capture, target and bubbling.  </s>
<s> All events first pass down the tree from the root to the direct parent of the target in the phase called 'capture'.  </s>
<s> All events then pass through the target node itself.  </s>
<s> Finally, bubbling events then pass up the tree from the direct parent of the target to the root of the tree in a phase called 'bubbling'.  </s>
<s> The route through the tree is determined before dispatch starts (so that if the tree changes during the phases, the original tree is used).  </s>
<s> [[Is this true?  </s>
<s> The current description is unclear, since 1.3.1 seems to suggest that the bubbling route is determined after capture.  </s>
<s> I discuss this more later.]]  </s>
<s> Listeners can be attached to nodes, which are activated when an event passes through the node.  </s>
<s> A listener can either listen for events that are in the capture phase, or in both of the other two phases, on the basis of the useCapture parameter.  </s>
<s> When an event passes through a node in a phase, any listeners attached to that node that are listening for that event in that phase are activated.  </s>
<s> It is not defined what order the listeners are activated.  </s>
<s> Any listener may call the stopPropagation method; if this happens, all remaining listeners on the current node are activated, but after that all remaining steps in the propagation of the event through the tree are not carried out.  </s>
<s> Some events have a default action, which gets carried out [when???  </s>
<s> I couldn't work it out].  </s>
<s> Any listener may call the preventDefault method for an event: if the event is cancellable, and it has a default action, that action is not performed.  </s>
<s> Now to handle some points in the existing description.  </s>
<s> 1.2 Description of event flow.  </s>
<s> "It can be handled locally at the EventTarget level or centrally from an EventTarget higher in the document tree.  </s>
<s> "= It can be handled at the event target or from an EventTarget higher in the document tree.  </s>
<s> 1.2.1 Event listeners activation "Each event has an EventTarget toward which the event is directed by the DOM implementation."=  </s>
<s> Each event has an EventTarget toward which the event is dispatched by the DOM implementation.  </s>
<s> (May as well use the correct term).  </s>
<s> This section describes what happens at the target.  </s>
<s> It says that the order of execution of handlers is undefined; however the order is undefined during *all* phases, not only at the target.  </s>
<s> As pointed out, both capturing and bubbling say that stopPropagation may be called, but not here.  </s>
<s> 1.2.2 Event capture "If no additional capturers exist and stopPropagation has not been called, the event triggers the appropriate EventListeners on the target itself."  </s>
<s> What does this sentence add that isn't already described.  </s>
<s> Because I don't understand why this sentence is here, I fear I am missing something.  </s>
<s> Paragraph beginning "Although event capture is similar to the delegation based event model".  </s>
<s> Please mark this paragraph as a note.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure who it is directed at, or who benefits from it.  </s>
<s> I would prefer it be deleted.  </s>
<s> I don't think it is normative.  </s>
<s> 1.2.4 Event cancellation "Some events are specified as cancelable.  </s>
<s> For these events, the DOM implementation generally has a default action associated with the event."  </s>
<s> What does 'generally' mean here.  </s>
<s> Which events that are cancellable do not have a default action?  </s>
<s> "An example of this is a hyperlink in a Web browser.  </s>
<s> When the user clicks on the hyperlink the default action is generally to activate that hyperlink.  </s>
<s> Before invoking a default action, the implementation must check for all event listeners registered to receive the event and dispatch the event to those listeners."  </s>
<s> Sneaky!  </s>
<s> This is a change from DOM2! DOM2 doesn't define when a default action gets invoked.  </s>
<s> Suppose an implementation implements default actions as a special class of handler on a node, that get executed after all user-defined handlers on that node (which is perfectly allowable according to DOM2.) All of a sudden those implementations will break for DOM3.  </s>
<s> So this is a non-compatible change.  </s>
<s> "This implies that those event listeners can be registered on the EventTarget, or on the capture or bubbling phases.  </s>
<s> " I think 'event target' is meant here, not EventTarget.  </s>
<s> Part of the problem is that 'default actions' are so mysterious and undefined, and only really appear here.  </s>
<s> Proposal: make default actions a first class citizen.  </s>
<s> The advantage would be that you could make a completely generic event processor, without any knowledge of how default actions work: - in 1.4 add a method, or a parameter to initEvent to register a default action for an event - define that the default action gets called after capture/target/bubbling, with the event as parameter.  </s>
<s> The default action can then use that information to decide how to react.  </s>
<s> 1.2.5 EventListener Grouping.  </s>
<s> I couldn't understand this section at all.  </s>
<s> What is event flow in a group?  </s>
<s> It is not defined anywhere.  </s>
<s> This needs a rewrite or some examples.  </s>
<s> 1.3.1.  </s>
<s> Event registration interfaces: Interface EventTarget: Method addEventListener "This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target."  </s>
<s> 'event target' should be 'EventTarget'.  </s>
<s> "If an EventListener is added to an EventTarget while it is processing an event, the EventListener will not be triggered by the current actions but may be triggered during a later stage of event flow, such as the bubbling phase."  </s>
<s> Too vague: "may"?  </s>
<s> What is a 'stage' of an event flow.  </s>
<s> Is it the same as a phase?  </s>
<s> Do you mean to say that if you add it during capture, it *must* be taken into account during bubbling?  </s>
<s> How about if I add it to a child node: does it get processed then?  </s>
<s> 1.2.2 says "If modifications occur to the tree during event processing, event flow will proceed based on the initial state of the tree." but doesn't define what a change to the tree is.  </s>
<s> Is adding a listener a change?  </s>
<s> By the way, you shouldn't say "an EventTarget processes an event" but "an event gets processed at an EventTarget".  </s>
<s> Parameter useCapture "If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to initiate capture."  </s>
<s> What does 'initiate capture' mean?  </s>
<s> I think you mean "if the user wants this listener to be activated during the capture phase."  </s>
<s> method addEventListenerNS, parameter evtGroup Where are the semantics of groups defined?  </s>
<s> method canTriggerNS "This method allows the DOM application to know if an event listener, attached to this EventTarget or one of its ancestors, will be triggered by the specified event type during the dispatch of the event to this event target or one of its descendants.  </s>
<s> " The second 'event target' should be 'EventTarget'.  </s>
<s> Can trigger during any phase?  </s>
<s> You should say so explicitely one way or the other.  </s>
<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> I notice now that sometimes a listener is triggered, and sometimes activated.  </s>
<s> Also sometimes an event is fired, and sometimes dispatched.  </s>
<s> Needs cleaning up.  </s>
<s> method dispatchEvent "This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event mo del.": implementation's method isRegisteredHereNS "event target"= "EventTarget" method removeEventListener "If an EventListener is removed from an EventTarget while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions."  </s>
<s> Who is doing the processing here: the EventListener or the EventTarget?  </s>
<s> Replace with "If an EventListener is removed from an EventTarget while an event is being processed there, it will not be triggered by the current actions."  </s>
<s> method removeEventListenerNS Same as above.  </s>
<s> "independently of the event groups."  </s>
<s> whatever *that* means.  </s>
<s> Interface EventListenerGroup "When an event is dispatched, it is dispatched independently to each EventListenerGroup."  </s>
<s> What does *that* mean?  </s>
<s> An event is dispatched to a target, not to a group of listeners.  </s>
<s> Ooh.  </s>
<s> You're going to need to rewrite the introduction on event flow even more.  </s>
<s> I just don't understand this! "In particular, the stopPropagation method of the Event interface only stops propagation within an EventListener's associated EventListenerGroup." Where's *that* described?  </s>
<s> 1.4 Basic Interfaces method initEvent "This method may only be called before the Event has been dispatched via the dispatchEvent method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary."  </s>
<s> What does "that phase" mean?  </s>
<s> Does it mean "before the event is ever dispatched"?  </s>
<s> Is it right (as this wording suggests) that you can call initEvent as often as you want before dispatching it, but never after.  </s>
<s> Or does it mean that it should be called at least once before dispatch, but may be reinitialised later?  </s>
<s> This text is used in many places, so I won't repeat this comment again, but it applies to every occurrence.  </s>
<s> "This method sets the type attribute to eventTypeArg, and localName and namespaceURI to null.  </s>
<s> To initialize an event with a qualified name and namespace URI, use the initEventNS method.  </s>
<s> " Please unify this text with that for initEventNS, which uses a table.  </s>
<s> "canBubbleArg of type boolean Specifies whether or not the event can bubble.  </s>
<s> This parameter overrides the intrinsic bubbling behavior of the event."  </s>
<s> Delete last sentence.  </s>
<s> (And everywhere else the canBubbleArg parameter is defined) "cancelableArg of type boolean Specifies whether or not the event's default action can be prevented.  </s>
<s> This parameter overrides the intrinsic cancelable behavior of the event."  </s>
<s> Delete last sentence.  </s>
<s> (And everywhere else the cancelableArg parameter is defined) method preventDefault "If, during any stage of event flow, the preventDefault method is called the event is canceled.  </s>
<s> Any default action associated with the event will not occur."  </s>
<s> Replace with: "If, during any stage of event flow, the preventDefault method is called any default action associated with the event will not occur."  </s>
<s> 1.4.1 Event creation I suspect that the reason I don't understand this section is because 'eventType' is different from 'Event.type' (in the Event interface).  </s>
<s> If I am right, then please rename the concept called 'event type' here to something else so I can understand it.  </s>
<s> Maybe 'event kind' or event sort'.  </s>
<s> I think a new concept is being introduced here, but I don't understand it, and it needs explaining.  </s>
<s> 1.5 Event module definitions This whole section about naming recommends using prefixes to keep event names distinct.  </s>
<s> But then what is the point of namespaces then?  </s>
<s> If you use the namespace interfaces, then you should be able to call your events anything you like.  </s>
<s> That's the whole point!  </s>
<s> Then different applications can call similar events the same thing, and you still can identify which it is.  </s>
<s> xhtml:activate svg:activate xforms:activate might be three different events for the same concept of activation.  </s>
<s> It would be daft to have to have svg:SVGActivate.  </s>
<s> 1.5.1 DOMFocusIn//FocusOut "Unlike the HTML event focus, DOMFocusIn can be applied to any focusable EventTarget, not just FORM controls.  </s>
<s> " This is a tautology.  </s>
<s> You can only focus on focusable elements.  </s>
<s> So what's a focusable element?  </s>
<s> DOMActivate "The activate event occurs when an element's default action is activated, for instance, thru a MouseEvent click or a TextEvent textInput."  </s>
<s> Again, tautological.  </s>
<s> s/thru/through/ 1.5.2 Mouse Events Attribute 'button'.  </s>
<s> My mouse has three buttons: two on top, and one for the thumb.  </s>
<s> The thumb button is the leftmost, and therefore button zero according to your definition, but not what you intend I'm sure.  </s>
<s> 1.5.3  </s>
<s> Text events This interface is horrible.  </s>
<s> Bound to a keyboard, and a fairly specific one as far as I can see (No 'help' key?  </s>
<s> Oh, Windows keyboards don't have them!).  </s>
<s> Why should text be bound to a keyboard?  </s>
<s> What about speech input?  </s>
<s> Or a tablet?  </s>
<s> I think you need a logical text interface before a keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> And why the inconsistencies between the keyboard in the mouse events, and the one here?  </s>
<s> 1.5.5 HTML Event types Why are these HTML specific?  </s>
<s> XHTML would like to use generic DOM events, so using DOMFocusIn instead of focus, etc.  </s>
<s> I propose a Device Module supporting: DOMLoaded, DOMUnloaded, DOMLoadAborted, DOMLoadFailed, a Viewport Module, supporting at least: DOMResized (surely with context info), DOMScrolled (ditto).  </s>
<s> I don't think we need a generic 'select' 'change' 'submit', since you can do those with other means, nor 'focus' and 'blur'.  </s>
<s> Steven Pemberton For the HTML WG and the Forms WG  </s>
<s> No, we didn't change from DOM2: Before processing these events, the implementation must check for event listeners registered to receive the event and dispatch the event to those listeners.  </s>
<s> These listeners then have the option of canceling the implementation's default action or allowing the default action to proceed.  </s>
<s> We rephrased the paragraph following your own request but we didn't change the semantic associated with default actions and preventDefault.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> The new proposal, the TextEvent and KeyboardEvent interfaces, is a complete new approach for keyboard events.  </s>
<s> It should satisfy your concerns.  </s>
<s> Also, the new proposed draft should also address the remaining part of your concerns.  </s>
<s> If it is not the case, please let us know.  </s>
<s> Philippe PS: your issue has been closed  </s>
