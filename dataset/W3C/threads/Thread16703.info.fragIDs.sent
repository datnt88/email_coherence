<s> after further investigation I found a way to use this site without JavaScript Here are URLs I tested: Sports: Figure Skating Links from the frontpage: Variety is the spice of life (or try any other) As it was mentioned already, Lynx doesn't have JS and therefor it doesn't need any special tuning - you can launch these URLs directly.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if someone (with good Lynx experience) can try these links  </s>
<s> BINGO, it worked pretty much as good as any I have seen recently in Lynx,  </s>
<s> now I didn't follow all the links but enough to get a feel and everything  </s>
<s> seemed to come up without hassle.  </s>
<s> two questions why aren't these URL advertised  </s>
<s> and I didn't see anything about the Paralympics, is there anything on the main pages  </s>

<s> this question is easy to answer :-(( They sell *banners*, every new hit displays new banner (or 2-3 banners) Javascript on main page _forces_ you to see site _exactly_ in way they need (you see all banners, preferable search engine, link to MSNBC.com, joint venture of NBC and MSN.com, etc.) Turning Off JavaScript you take-off their banners...  </s>
<s> That's why it's said "JavaScript is required to see NBCOlumpics.com"  </s>
<s> There is no other _technical_ requiremnt, as far as I can conclude from their code.  </s>
<s> don't know about that.  </s>
<s> I think it was in "GAMES" section, don't remember.  </s>
