<s> Hello List, Leonard had a question about replying to a message and then inserting information.  </s>
<s> We mean this to be very simple.  </s>
<s> 1. a person replies to the message and this normally inserts a  sign to the left side of the message.  </s>
<s> 2. Go to the top of the message and state that you want to insert comments and that you will use your initials before each comment.  </s>
<s> GWK: is what I normally use.  </s>
<s> 3. Where you want to make a comment I put GWK: and then go on for as long  </s>
<s> as necessary.  </s>
<s> I don't put GWK: at the beginning of each line.  </s>
<s> The person  </s>
<s> knows the inserted information is over, because you then bump into the  </s>
<s> again.  </s>
<s> I normally say, "in the above information" or "in the information that follows" This gives the person a clue that you are referring to what is above or below your comment.  </s>
<s> When I read such a message, I end up reading the first part and then search for the initials followed by the colon.  </s>
<s> This saves a ton of time especially on long messages.  </s>
<s> I use this technique when people ask me to review large documents and proposals as well.  </s>
<s> Hope this is helpful.  </s>
<s> Best George Best George George Kerscher, Project Manager PM to the DAISY Consortium Recording For the Blind &amp; Dyslexic  </s>
<s> Good points George, There is, however, one slight problem.  </s>
<s> When you said in your message,  </s>
<s> "The person knows the inserted information is over, because you then bump  </s>
<s> into the  again."  </s>
<s> I had to change the punctuation level of my screen reader in order to hear the greater than sign pronounced.  </s>
<s> True, if I knew I was going to have to look for that sign, I could possibly put up with hearing all the other unwanted punctuation just to hear the greater than sign.  </s>
<s> It might, however, be preferable to some to choose a character which is spoken when the least amount of punctuation is turned on in the greatest number of screen readers.  </s>
<s> This is why, in an earlier post, I suggested an asterisk.  </s>
<s> In the number of screen readers I have used, this is one of a number of commonly pronounced symbols in the condition stated above.  </s>
<s> Of course, there are others that could be chosen also.  </s>

<s> George: Thanks for clearing up my misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> This all sounds very reasonable and workable.  </s>
<s> Sorry for not understanding this the first time through.  </s>
<s> -- Jim  </s>
<s> Couple of answers or rather proposals.  </s>
<s> 1) As George noted It was our intent to have the initials appear ONLY at the beginning of the message.  </s>
<s> And then only when you are inserting text within the body of old text.  </s>
<s> If you are only inserting one paragraph, just mark the front end of it.  </s>
<s> The end of the paragraph indicates the end of the comment.  </s>
<s> 2) if inserting multiple paragraphs of text you can use Start GV: And End GV: To indicate the beginning and end.  </s>
<s> In this fashion you don't need to set your screen reader to read greater than signs (which messes up your ability to read the rest of the text in the message).  </s>
<s> If you just see someones initials in front of a paragraph, they have just inserted one paragraph.  </s>
<s> If they insert enough that they feel they need to break it up into paragraphs they can mark the beginning and the end.  </s>
<s> 3) In answer to the other question, Including just a chunk of someone else's text would be handled by On a line by itself just in front of what someone else wrote.  </s>
<s> You can then either put End of Tom Thompson Or My Response Or GV: Or anything else that seems logical or that your email program adds to the start of yours text.  </s>
<s> It isn't critical what you write at the start of your comments each time unless you are doing lots of them throughout and you want people to be able to jump to your additions.  </s>
<s> if you want them to jump to them you should use GV: 4) Neal suggested that there be a unique character in front of all initials so that you could jump to the start of each and every persons.  </s>
<s> My response: Good suggestion Neal.  </s>
<s> However rather than having to type unique characters before and after the intials, what if you just used two semicolons after the initials as in GV semicolon, semicolon.  </s>
<s> GV:: It would be unique.  </s>
<s> It would be easy to type.  </s>
<s> Would it cause more verbal clutter with synthesizers if they hit a double colon?  </s>
<s> That is, do they just pause at a single colon but pronounce a double colon or something?  </s>
<s> Can people advise?  </s>
<s> Or suggest some simple, easy to type but unique character?  </s>
<s> Maybe a right square bracket then the initials and a colon.  </s>
<s> Right brackets usually do not appear as the first character of a line.  </s>
<s> (left square brackets maybe but not usually right square brackets.)  </s>
<s> We need to keep this simple of course.  </s>
<s> Any other suggestions for ways to address this that are simple yet effective with most screen readers?  </s>
