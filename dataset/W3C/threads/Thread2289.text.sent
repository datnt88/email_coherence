5.1.2 says: Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path The intent is to require a specific form of absoluteURI, but the syntax at 3.2.1: absoluteURI = scheme ":" *( uchar | reserved ) allows something much broader. 
Perhaps we need: request-abs-URI= scheme ":" net_path What can/should we say about "scheme"? 
Dave Kristol The syntax is correct. 
The intent is to allow any form of absolute URI. 
Nothing beyond what is already said.

I said earlier: It's clear I wasn't clear about what I meant to say.... 
I would think that for the *http* specification, particularly for an origin server, there are the following additional requirements that are currently unstated: - absoluteURI must be an http_URL (3.2.2) - (should https_URL and shttp_URL also be mentioned?) - host must be the FQDN of the host to which the request is sent Dave Kristol I don't think so. 
Proxies also act as gateways between protocols, so a client that only knows how to do HTTP can still get resources in other protocols (e.g. ftp, gopher, etc.). 
If you make this requirement, then you require all clients to have native access support. 
This seems bad to me. 
And whatever URL type comes up in the future? 
Seems best to be silent, rather than restrictive. 
Not to mention the problem of referencing non-standards documents. 
Now this makes some sense to me; to require the FQDN in any URL type This is the last trace of the host problem. 
I'm not familiar enough with all the specs to say if we have the situation right in the collection of HTTP related specs. 
Editorial comment here: It is often good practice not to over-specify something, which might make an implementation non-compliant for no perceptible good reason (we have the example in the first situation above). 
Conversely, when you specify something precisely, which may be needed for interoperable implementations, you must fully understand all the consequences. 
For example, the broken (esthetically ugly) wide lines and arcs in the X Window System are the result of a simple and precise specification the consequences of which were not fully understood until after the fact; we ran into what was still a research problem without realizing it. 
You can get burned both ways. 
- Jim Absolutely NOT on all three items. 
HTTP is used as a generic interface protocol for resolving any URI, including URNs (which do not have a hostname) and any number of other identifiers which follow the URI syntax. 
That syntax is correctly described in the spec. 
The http URL is also described because this is the only specification which can describe it. 
https and shttp have their own specifications and are not relevant to this protocol.

I said "particularly for an origin server". 
I believe an *origin server* sees either a relativeURI or an absoluteURI in the form of an http_URL on the request line. 
I'm trying to nail down what an origin server should expect to see. 
It should be specified somewhere. 
Dave Kristol No, it doesn't need to be specified anywhere beyond the syntax limitations already specified. 
The server is capable of controlling its own namespace, period. 
The protocol does not make any additional limitations where none are needed, particularly when they would hinder use of HTTP outside the typical Internet browser realm.

Okay, I'll accept your arguments. 
However, there is still a piece I feel is missing: 1) We want clients to send, and servers to accept, an absoluteURI. 
2) Eventually we want to obviate the need for Host:. 
3) The purpose of absoluteURI and/or Host is to specify the virtual host for (at least) an http_URL. 
The reason I've been trying to restrict the absoluteURI syntax is that then it becomes easy to identify the virtual host. 
I believe somewhere in the spec. 
there should be an explanation of how to identify the virtual host of "the resource identified by the request". 
Dave Kristol No, we only want servers to accept an absoluteURI. 
Clients can't send it until 2.0. 
Not in 1.x. 
The stuff added to the third block of text in section 5.1.2 is wrong -- it needs to be removed. 
That is only one of many things that absoluteURI is used for in the specification. 
In fact, it is probably the least important of them. 
I believe Koen asked for such a section of text to be added to the section on Requests. 
However, that must not change the protocol syntax.
