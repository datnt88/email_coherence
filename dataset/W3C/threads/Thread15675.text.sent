The problem boils down to mathematics: There is one HTML standard There are 2 major browsers There are several major HTML authoring tools There are dozens of major accessibility aids There are millions of web page designers We try to twist the arms of the web page designers, but we will never reach all of them. 
Starting with IE, the browsers are becoming highly accessible. 
Let's work on the authoring tools and making sure that the accessibility ISVs are using the features provided by the browsers. 
Like Scott says, people think this is all cool, but when push comes to shove, they will abandon "accessible design" in favor of cool graphics and eye candy. 
Charles Oppermann Windows NT User Interface Group, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!" Hi, I was wondering if anyone has been doing a long term follow-up to trainings on web accessibility. 
A pattern I think I'm seeing seems to be: 1. Attend workshop 2. Be exposed to unexpected problems on web pages 3. Be appreciative of the exposure 4. Go back to work 5. Realize the implications of the technology gap, i.e. extra work, conflicts on whether to take advantage of modern inaccessible technology 6. Go into shock 7. Do some easy stuff 8. Put rest on "to do" list for when there's some free time I ran into one attendee from the UC Berkeley workshop at a coffee shop who was fairly frustrated in trying to be accessible and be current like her manager wants the site to be. 
Her question was who is responsible for making sure that accessibility is current with the technology. 
Is it her responsibility to compensate for the failings of the technology world and/or the disabled world in letting the technology gap develop? 
Scott to follow up on what Charles said: There is not doubt that our best laid plans for accessible HTML usage will be dust-on-the-shelf ware unless they are a natural fit as defaults within the leading authoring tools of the sighted majority. 
You will see that philosophy being applied, for example, in the discussion of table browsing leading up to and following the post w3c-wai-hc@w3.org from October to December 1997: the "balloon help" gambit On the other hand, dealing with the tools of the majority is not enough. 
The universal Web has to be accessible to writers as well as readers. 
For the foreseeable future that means that the HTML language has to make sense as a medium of exchange between people authoring in WYSWYG and people authoring in source text, as discussed in Status of ACSS action item on 02 July 1977 This means that the usage guidelines need to work in both contexts, too. 
-- Al Gilman This is a VERY real problem area and one that we need to address. 
We just finished a preliminary guidelines compilation - it is under review in the guidelines subgroup. 
THERE IS A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. 
A priority has to be thinking about how to make the guidelines simpler and reduce the work of page authors without dropping necessary access considerations. 
We have launched a project here currently called c2s2 (cooperative cross-segment strategy project) to look at how this might be done by dividing the problem across segments (authors, user agent designers, website tool developers, web author tool developers and at manufacturers) to see what can be done. 
We are interested in all input. 
Otherwise I am afraid all this is going to get so complicated that people will start to bail or feel they have justification to ignore it.
