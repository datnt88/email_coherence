Thursday, 1 November, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France? 
8 AM Friday Australian summer time) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: Agenda 1. 
The agenda of the forthcoming face to face meeting (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/11/f2f-agenda.html). 
2. Document for review: the Education and Outreach working group (EO wg) has requested that we review and comment upon the following document: Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design: Any comments need to be collected and forwarded to the Education and Outreach working group before Friday. 
3. Conformance: how to define the "minimum set" that will be required of implementors in order to make valid WCAG 2.0 conformance claims. 
This issue has occupied much of the working group's recent e-mail discussion and was considered in detail at the last meeting. 
Consult the mailing list archives (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/) for details. 
The following threads are of particular note: (The OTACS proposal (concerns raised regarding OTACS 2) (Gian's proposal--not yet assigned a descriptive label) (Eliminate barriers with aid of AT) Please be well prepared for a discussion of these proposals at Thursday's meeting. 
Regrets - I will not be able to make the meeting. 
For the forthcoming face to face I would like to see the group work on resolving the issues that came from the ERT group - this is a dependency ATAG has that has been waiting a long time. 
I would also like to review the script techniques proposed - whether at the meeting or at some point in the grou's near-term agenda. 
I would like to repeat the discussion of resolving issues in WCAG 1.0 and publishing the Resolutions of the working group. 
(I need ansers to these, so I will just keep adding it to agendas I guess). 
Chaals Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I understand from discussions with Matt that the forthcoming HTML techniques draft will contain proposed resolutions for these issues. 
If this draft is available by the face to face meeting, perhaps the issues could be considered by an HTML sub-group during the techniques session which will be held as part of the meeting. 
If we have sufficient attendees with interest in the area we can also consider the DOM and script-related techniques. 
I will probably have to miss today's call -- apologies.
