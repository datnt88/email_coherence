I would like to suggest that: - any test cases with relative URIs should use XML Base - any examples in any of our documents that use relative URIs should use XML Base - that the syntax and primer documents should suggest that the use of XML Base is preferred. 
Note: rdf:ID introduces relative URIs. 
The sort of use that I envisage is that where a document on the web includes an xml:base declaration which gives the documents usual base URL. 
Not including such base uris makes teh document ambiguous. 
For example if I GET then the triples that I find are those in However, if I get then I get different triples, and these are not the ones in any nt file in the test area. 
Similarly I might get or and get different results. 
(Sorry to raise this so late; I have only recently noticed this) Jeremy The datatyping spec already does. 
;-) Patrick esource-attr/test001.nt However, if I get then I get different triples, and these are not the ones in any nt file in the test area.

(Sorry to raise this so late; I have only recently noticed this) Jeremy Jeremy Carroll said: I'd say, any test cases or examples with relative URIs should be replace with absolute ones first (http://example.org/ 
etc) For what cases? 
I'd not introduce it unless necessary. 
It means that it is required to have a working (RDF compatible; passes the rdf core xml-base tests) xml:base support before any other test can be performed. 
OK, only when that is present. 
[I thought we were preferring rdf:about="#foo" over rdf:ID="foo" - a style issue, but the latter does provide some uniqueness checks.] 
I counter-propose suggesting xml:base in test cases or examples when rdf:ID is present and just recommending it when people feel like it is useful to make all those long URLs shorter - not prefering it to be present overall. 
Er - don't do that :) The manifest.rdf files list the absolute URLs to use. 
We don't need to engineer around using the wrong URLs for testing.
