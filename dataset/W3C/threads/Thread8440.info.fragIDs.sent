<s> That's probably because I could not make either meeting...  </s>
<s> I think we do need a mechanism by which a client can be told that it should not attempt to process a message it may not understand IF THAT IS THE DESIRED RESULT.  </s>
<s> One specific condition I have been considering is the case in which an XML message represents a negotiable instrument (e.g. a Bill of Lading).  </s>
<s> The conditions of validity for which can  </s>
<s> only be understood in the context of a particular rule book.  </s>
<s> In this case I would like to ensure that clients which are not aware of the requirements of a specific rule book do not erroneously validate the signature.  </s>
<s> The problem with criticality flags is that they are too fine grained and lead to overuse but the effect is on occasion usefull.  </s>
<s> A better means of achieving the desired result would be a specific criticality attribute which would reference a URI.  </s>
<s> E.g. Similar requirements pop up in the public space - literally.  </s>
<s> Barb and I know a certain lawyer who is keen to have disclaimers pop up to achieve 'constructive notice' of certain terms and conditions.  </s>
<s> I certainly don't think we need a system as fine grained as X.509v3 criticality flags.  </s>
<s> But we do need to recognise that in the case of signatures restricted interoperability is sometimes explicitly desired.  </s>
<s> In terms of implementation difficulty this should not be too much trouble.  </s>
<s> The 'check signature' property of the XML document object simply flags a warning that everything has checked out but there may be some problems.  </s>
<s> Generic clients are also much better off since instead of 'there may be a problem here but I'm not going to tell you what' they can be refered to a source which can resolve the problem.  </s>

<s> Had you been at the meeting, hopefully I would've convinced you this is a trust application decision smile , and is not related to whether (valid:signed-resource == true)  </s>
<s> signed-resource(I, C, key, sig): there was some request R such that GET(R) = C and address(R) = I and sign-doc(C, key, sig) sign-doc(C, key, sig): sig is the value of a strong one-way function over content and key that yields C integrity/validity and K non-repudiability  </s>
<s> Again, I would like to redefine "validate" specifically to signature validation, not trust evaluation/inference.  </s>
<s> I think you were speaking of the ability to make application statements such that one can make a useful inference: trusted-statement(signed-resource(I, C, key, sig)): where (signed-resource(I, C, key, sig) and (C consists of assertions {S1, S2, S3}) and infer(S1,S2,S3).  </s>
