<s> But there is no need to allow the user in this case [8x8 pixels] to decrease the font size.  </s>
<s> Since there is no accessibility requirement for smaller sizes, no priority is associated with adding this capability to a browser.  </s>
<s> Good.  </s>
<s> I will take this to mean that it is ok for the font size preference  </s>
<s> in a UA to have a lower limit of 8 pixels.  </s>
<s> As an example, currently in IE5/Mac we have both the ability to set the  </s>
<s> default medium font size (in pixels) and the resolution of the display (since the Macintosh provides no capability in the operating system for  </s>
<s> doing so).  </s>
<s> IE5/Mac also provides the ability to instantly "zoom" the size  </s>
<s> of all text on any page through its easily accessible "Text Zoom" menu.  </s>
<s> Our font size preference is a menu of typical/popular options (12,14,16,18,24) and an "Other..." option which allows the user to enter their preferred default medium font size.  </s>
<s> If the user enters a size less  </s>
<s> than 9, the value is set to 9. This was based upon input from Todd Fahrner,  </s>
<s> a screen font/typography expert who noted that 9 pixels is really the  </s>
<s> practical minimum for readable text (8 pixels being too small).  </s>
<s> From my understanding of this discussion, IE5/Mac would NOT be considered to  </s>
<s> be compliant with this checkpoint (despite having perhaps the most  </s>
<s> comprehensive user control over font size and screen resolution of available  </s>
<s> visual web browsers as noted in numerous reviews).  </s>
<s> Also from my understanding of this discussion, if we changed this lower bound to 8, then we would be compliant with this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I'd like to ask the (perhaps rhetorical) question, who would be helped by this change?  </s>
<s> Either way, I'd like to suggest that a parenthetical comment be added to the  </s>
<s> checkpoint description summarizing what you said about western characters and 8 pixels (or my suggestion: 9 pixels) being the effective limit of readability.  </s>
