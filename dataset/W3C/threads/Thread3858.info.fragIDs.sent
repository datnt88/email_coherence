The current spec only allows functions to be either built in or defined in 
the query in which they are used. 
I think it would be very useful to allow 
functions to be imported just like schemas are imported. 
This would allow 
authors to create a library of functions and include them in their query 
without the need to duplicate them or make the global (or built-in) How about? 
ImportFunctions ::= "import" "functions" "at" StringLiteral Regards, Eddie 
The WG is working on such a facility. 
Please see Issues 74 and 75 (and related issues).

Thanks: we're working on specifications for "modules" at the moment, one of the main aims is to support such function libraries.
