Hello, 
I'm researching an issue regarding whether international characters are allowed in email addresses. 
Through the research that I've conducted thus 
far I've seen contradictory information. 
In looking at RFC-822 it only specifies ASCII characters being allowed, however I have actually seen a few email addresses that do in fact have international characters in them. 
For example, jos?.berm?dez@xxxxxx.com 
-- note the accented 'e' and 'u'. 
If anyone has any more definitive information regarding what is and what is not supported in respect to international characters in email addresses, I would be greatly appreciative. 
Thanks in advance.

Thanks, Dave, Where might I go to find more information on the standard you mentioned below? 
Thanks, John 
no, they're not. 
in all current mail standards email addresses must be entirely in ASCII. 
well, we can be a bit friendlier to the topic, I think. 
Only ASCII "characters" are permitted, however there is a standard that permits encoding international characters into an ASCII form. 
So the pure negative is: raw (binary) international characters are not permitted. 
The positive is: Encoded international characters are permitted.

I guess Dave was referring to RFC2047. 
However, RFC2047 expressly forbids using the encoded strings in address specifications.

no, they're not.

right. it only applies to the "display name" string. 
so, the added constraint is a) no international characters in the mailbox string, and b) encoding of international strings in the domain name is forthcoming.
