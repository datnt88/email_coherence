<s> Hello, The RNIB relaunched their accessible website late in June, and came under criticism by UK web developers, including myself.  </s>
<s> They have taken the criticism and have recently publically replied: echqa.hcsp  </s>
<s> Its good to see they've corrected many of the serious errors on their sites (like the URLs).  </s>
<s> I spotted this URL while looking through my referrer logs earlier today, and I was surprised to see they were linking directly to my initial redesign attempt.  </s>
<s> Its unfortunate that they've picked on the flaws of my design and labelled them as criticisms against CSS - but the damage is done (and I acknowledge we were warned right here to make sure our house was in order before criticising others).  </s>
<s> Their criticism of my redesign was largely due to my use of absolute positioning (and rushing the job), which on narrow windows causes overlapping and creating unreadable text - as they correctly point out - this is far worse than the horizontal scrolling their site degrades to on lack of space.  </s>
<s> As a point of principle, and to prove that it can be done in CSS, I've spent a few hours reimplementing the design using floats to eliminate any overlapping problems.  </s>
<s> I felt it neccessary to correct the impression the RNIB are creating about CSS layouts as inferior to presentational-based HTML.  </s>
<s> I really wanted to initiate a discussion on the reply given by the RNIB on their website.  </s>
<s> Reading their answers, I feel more confused and concerned than ever.  </s>
<s> Thanks Mike  </s>
<s> Regarding your second iteration: I'd suggest a few changes.  </s>
<s> 1) Add a default background color to the page.  </s>
<s> If they haven't noticed this yet, somebody will.  </s>
<s> Hypothetically, if a user had their default browser background color set to black, they couldn't read some of your text.  </s>
<s> However, if they override your specified one with !important and forget to add a foreground color, that's their own fault.  </s>
<s> 2) Add a min-width specification (maybe 100px?) to the main (middle) content DIV.  </s>
<s> This won't work in every browser, but it will help some browsers overcome the overlap problem that is still happening a little bit.  </s>
<s> Good luck.  </s>
<s> Keep fighting the good fight.  </s>

<s> Subject: The RNIB replies to web design criticism  </s>
<s> The particular points I found "interesting" were: "HTML is not inherently inaccessible, nor is XHTML and CSS inherently accessible."  </s>
<s> This is confusing.  </s>
<s> It could be construed that HTML is more accessible than XHTML (I certainly seem to be reading it that way).  </s>
<s> "support for CSS positioning (particularly when we started working on this design some time ago) was not sufficiently robust for us to move completely to CSS for positioning and formatting.  </s>
<s> In some respects, it still isn't" They pick up one flawed example - mine, but ignore the other two.  </s>
<s> On using tables for layout "WAI recommends using tables for data only but this is a recommendation only" Since the WCAG 1.0 is a technical recommendation, that kinda means - using this line of reasoning - that none of the checkpoints apply.  </s>
<s> Am I reading too much into checkpoint 3.3 url:http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-style-sheets "Use style sheets to control layout and presentation."?  </s>
<s> On the bright side, they've realised that alt="" is the better alternative text for spacer images (which shouldn't be used anyway, IMO, especially for a new design).  </s>
