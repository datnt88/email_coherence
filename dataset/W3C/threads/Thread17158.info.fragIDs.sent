Hello, The RNIB relaunched their accessible website late in June, and came under criticism by UK web developers, including myself. 
They have taken the criticism and have recently publically replied: echqa.hcsp 
Its good to see they've corrected many of the serious errors on their sites (like the URLs). 
I spotted this URL while looking through my referrer logs earlier today, and I was surprised to see they were linking directly to my initial redesign attempt. 
Its unfortunate that they've picked on the flaws of my design and labelled them as criticisms against CSS - but the damage is done (and I acknowledge we were warned right here to make sure our house was in order before criticising others). 
Their criticism of my redesign was largely due to my use of absolute positioning (and rushing the job), which on narrow windows causes overlapping and creating unreadable text - as they correctly point out - this is far worse than the horizontal scrolling their site degrades to on lack of space. 
As a point of principle, and to prove that it can be done in CSS, I've spent a few hours reimplementing the design using floats to eliminate any overlapping problems. 
I felt it neccessary to correct the impression the RNIB are creating about CSS layouts as inferior to presentational-based HTML. 
I really wanted to initiate a discussion on the reply given by the RNIB on their website. 
Reading their answers, I feel more confused and concerned than ever. 
Thanks Mike 
Regarding your second iteration: I'd suggest a few changes. 
1) Add a default background color to the page. 
If they haven't noticed this yet, somebody will. 
Hypothetically, if a user had their default browser background color set to black, they couldn't read some of your text. 
However, if they override your specified one with !important and forget to add a foreground color, that's their own fault. 
2) Add a min-width specification (maybe 100px?) to the main (middle) content DIV. 
This won't work in every browser, but it will help some browsers overcome the overlap problem that is still happening a little bit. 
Good luck. 
Keep fighting the good fight.

Subject: The RNIB replies to web design criticism 
The particular points I found "interesting" were: "HTML is not inherently inaccessible, nor is XHTML and CSS inherently accessible." 
This is confusing. 
It could be construed that HTML is more accessible than XHTML (I certainly seem to be reading it that way). 
"support for CSS positioning (particularly when we started working on this design some time ago) was not sufficiently robust for us to move completely to CSS for positioning and formatting. 
In some respects, it still isn't" They pick up one flawed example - mine, but ignore the other two. 
On using tables for layout "WAI recommends using tables for data only but this is a recommendation only" Since the WCAG 1.0 is a technical recommendation, that kinda means - using this line of reasoning - that none of the checkpoints apply. 
Am I reading too much into checkpoint 3.3 url:http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-style-sheets "Use style sheets to control layout and presentation."? 
On the bright side, they've realised that alt="" is the better alternative text for spacer images (which shouldn't be used anyway, IMO, especially for a new design).
