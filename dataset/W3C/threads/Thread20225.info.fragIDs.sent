Hi all, I didn't use Amaya as a browser/editor but only want to use it as a tool to validate if a document(e.g. XHTML) is well-formed. 
I want to know if Amaya privates the function and how to perform. 
Thanks zuoli

Hi, 
Amaya recovers a set of HTML errors but not all of them. 
So you can use Amaya to improve your documents, but not to validate them. 
Please use http://validator.w3.org/ for that. 
Regards 
Irene. 
Other things to consider are nsgmls, the SGML parser at the core of the above service and referenced from that site, and Dave Raggett's Tidy program, a command line repairer for HTML
