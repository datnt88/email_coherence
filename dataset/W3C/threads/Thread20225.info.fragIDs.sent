<s> Hi all, I didn't use Amaya as a browser/editor but only want to use it as a tool to validate if a document(e.g. XHTML) is well-formed.  </s>
<s> I want to know if Amaya privates the function and how to perform.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Amaya recovers a set of HTML errors but not all of them.  </s>
<s> So you can use Amaya to improve your documents, but not to validate them.  </s>
<s> Please use http://validator.w3.org/ for that.  </s>
<s> Regards  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Other things to consider are nsgmls, the SGML parser at the core of the above service and referenced from that site, and Dave Raggett's Tidy program, a command line repairer for HTML  </s>
