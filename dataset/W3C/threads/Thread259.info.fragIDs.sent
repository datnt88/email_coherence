<s> I tried the Oct. 22 Tidy on this snippet to check it's XML "pretty printing" capabilities: Here are the relevant config options, followed by Tidy's output: input-xml: yes output-xml: yes indent: auto add-xml-pi: no new-inline-tags: foo new-blocklevel-tags: doc, fee, fi, fo foo stuff Shouldn't it be: /Jelks  </s>
<s> Hi, I, like Jelks, am having trouble with line wrapping on my xml 'inline' tags.  </s>
<s> I've had the problem both before and after the Oct. 22 version.  </s>
<s> I thought that the 'xml' flag is getting ignored somewhere... the two subroutines PFlushline and PCondFlushLine each output newlines; I thought there would be a conditional in there, but I haven't been able to correct the problem that way--I must be barking up the wrong tree.  </s>

<s> That would make sense, yes.  </s>
<s> When Tidy sees that the input is in XML it doesn't bother with the tag dictionary.  </s>
<s> It uses PPrintXMLTree rather than PPrintTree for pretty printing.  </s>
<s> It should be easy enough to get PPrintXMLTree to check the dictionary though.  </s>
<s> Note that it would then "know" that p should always be treated in this way, which may not be the right thing to do.  </s>
