<s> However, I've grown out of favour of customized result property crap, and I think that I have a better way of modelling it: it'll just have to wait for EARL 0.96/0.97/1.0/+.  </s>

<s> You think you would, but really you wouldn't.  </s>
<s> Once you start prefix/alias creep, you can't get rid of it... Using Dublin Core in EARL is IMO precisely useless, and even if it were useful, any tools that recognized it should be clever enough to go get the EARL schema, search for property documentation, and find out that it's a subPropertyOf some Dublin Core term.  </s>
<s> So, even TimBL says to use other people's data... he didn't say where.  </s>
<s> Putting it in the schema is neater than putting it in the instance, where here we have a highly scoped application.  </s>
<s> If EARL were a patchwork of several hundred existing schemata, there wouldn't be a problem... but as it is, I think that the language is compact enough that it would be more of a burden than a benefit to use terms external to the EARL namespace.  </s>
