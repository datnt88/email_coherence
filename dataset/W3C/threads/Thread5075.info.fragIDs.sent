<s> I know that :)) So let me put the question otherwise, in terms of best practice.  </s>
<s> - Is it worth the trade-off to switch one's ontology (otherwise DL) to OWL-Full, just to allow its classes to be used as objects in 'dc:subject' predicates?  </s>
<s> - Or is it better to stay in OWL-DL using some workaround, like create e.g.  </s>
<s> thes:PhD_Thesis as an instance of 'concept' in a Thesaurus namespace distinct from the namespace of the class, this way : thes:PhD_Thesis rdf:type thes:Concept ex:Lina_Thesis rdf:type ex:PhD_Thesis ex:Lina_Thesisdc:subjectthes:Computational_Linguistics ex:Critic_of_Pure_Thesis rdf:type ex:PhD_Thesis ex:Critic_of_Pure_Thesisdc:subjectthes:PhD_Thesis But one would like to link somehow the class and the concept.  </s>
<s> To stay in DL, that could be done through annotation.  </s>
<s> Does the following make sense?  </s>
<s> ex:PhD_Thesis rdfs:isDefinedBy thes:PhD_Thesis The rationale in that last one is that terminology comes before ontology.  </s>
<s> Using the concept to define a class is just one of its possible uses.  </s>
<s> Another use of the concept is for indexation through dc:subject.  </s>
<s> I proposed this solution in the quoted project, but my linguist partner considers it too 'messy'.  </s>
<s> I acknowledge it's a bit subtle, but it allows to stick to OWL-DL while keeping separate Ontology and Thesaurus management.  </s>
<s> Things can be asserted about the concept of PhD_Thesis that are completely independent of properties or instances of the class.  </s>
<s> The difficulty for linguistic tools is that it's not obvious for them to distinguish in a NL request the cases where PhD_Thesis is used as a class (like in 'Where can I find a list of PhD_Theses in Linguistics?') from those where it's used as a concept (like in 'Who has written a critical study of PhD_Thesis?')  </s>
<s> Is the problem more clearly set this way?  </s>
<s> Is not it a BP issue?  </s>

<s> That's a weird way to ask the question.  </s>
<s> You mean, is it worth doing the extra work to break your naturally occuring model just so that you can be in DL?  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> I would argue this is indeed a BP issue, but probably for WORLD not for OPEN... we need to explain why and when you would do the extra work (and in every case we have explored it is extra work) to make sure your ontology is in the DL profile of OWL.  </s>

<s> *BV  </s>
<s> *Jim  </s>
<s> The way I put it might seem weird indeed, but it's the way it was set in the real project context (real world is weird).  </s>
<s> We had an OWL-DL ontology, and wanted to keep it so, and suddenly after six months or so some user wants to be able to use a class as a subject of a document ... which is one case out of one thousand, the 999 others using 'regular' subjects.  </s>
<s> So using a class as subject of a document is not exactly 'naturally occuring'.  </s>
<s> It's a borderline case - not to say a weird one :)) *Jim  </s>
<s> I suggested it might be in PORT scope, because it deals with the terminology vs ontology general issue.  </s>
<s> For me the heart of the question is to know what it means to 'use a concept' defined in a terminology (glossary, thesaurus, subject headings, index...) as a class (or a property) in an ontology.  </s>
<s> Is 'PhD Thesis' class the same 'subject' (using TM language here, sorry) or 'resource' than the original concept?  </s>
<s> The more I think about it, the more I have to deal with it, and the more I tend to say that they are distinct animals.  </s>
<s> Jim's PhD Thesis is an instance of the class, but not of the concept.  </s>
<s> One subject of 'Social Functions of PhD Thesis in Occidental University during 20th century', is the concept of PhD Thesis, not the class.  </s>
<s> So it's not just an issue of OWL-DL vs OWL-Full, it's also an issue of making distinct or not those two 'things'.  </s>
<s> This is a core issue in porting thesaurus to the SW, related to others of the same kind, like if concepts A and B are interpreted as classes, and there is a Broader-Narrower relationship between A and B in the Thesaurus, has it to be interpreted as a class-subclass relationship in the ontology etc.  </s>
<s> So I think in that case a BP definition would be two-fold 1.  </s>
<s> Is it generally a BP to make terminology concepts distinct from ontology classes (and properties)?  </s>
<s> 2. If agnostic about 1, what is the trade-off when choosing to make them distinct or to merge them ?  </s>
<s> FWIW, having tried both terms of the alternative in the course of time, my personal view, for above quoted reasons, is that they shoud be kept separate, and it's worth the extra work (even before being aware of the DL vs Full issue) Are there other concrete experience on that, not only theoretical considerations?  </s>
<s> Seems like there are not so many people exploring the terminology-ontology interoperability.  </s>
<s> Or are they?  </s>

<s> Yes, like Bernard, I have been thinking more about this, and about Ian's insistence in WebOnt that classes-and-instances was almost always raised by people wanting to mismodel their world.  </s>
<s> (cc Ian, wondering if I have learnt my lessons well!, or misrepresented him) The class hierarchy in RDFS/OWL is there to describe hierarchies of classes of resources.  </s>
<s> Just because you have a hierarchy of subject descriptors doesn't make it a class hierarchy.  </s>
<s> It seems to be confusing the human way of thinking of analogy and metaphor (any hierarchy can act as a metaphor for any other hierarchy) with what is a logical and implementation issue about how to say what we want to say about our knowledge of our world in a way that machines can process it.  </s>
<s> Thus if PhDThesis is an owl:Class what are the resources that we intend to belong to it?  </s>
<s> Probably my PhD Thesis with title "Graph Grammars: an approach to transfer based MT; exemplified by a Turkish-English system" is one such resource, but the copy sitting on my bookshelf is probably not.  </s>
<s> Then if that is the case what would we mean by dc:subject linking the resource of my thesis with this class .... hmmm ... we mean my thisis  </s>
<s> belongs to that class, i.e. rdf:type.  </s>
<s> So if we want to treat this subject hierachy as classes we really also want dc:creator rdf:subPropertyOf rdf:type .  </s>
<s> or perhaps eg:creator rdf:subPropertyOf rdf:type .  </s>
<s> eg:creator rdf:subPropertyOf dc:creator .  </s>
<s> But if we click on dc:creator we get to: rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-US" The topic of the content of the resource.  </s>
<s> /rdfs:comment Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords, key phrases or classification codes that describe a topic of the resource.  </s>
<s> Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary or formal classification scheme.  </s>
<s> /dc:description dc:type rdf:resource="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#element"/ dcterms:hasVersion rdf:resource="http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#subject-004"/ and we see that dc:subject should typically be a string from a controlled vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Thus it seems particularly poor practice to deviate from the preferred usage of dc:subject in order to (over-)simplify our model.  </s>
<s> This points to the solution I was earlier advocating of using such strings, using hasValue restrictions to map the strings into classes and then using the class hierachy on those restrictions to show the hierarchical relationships between the subject vocab terms.  </s>
<s> To do this well, we probably want to specialise the dc:subject property with a subproperty eg:subject, specify its range with an owl:Datarange explicitly enumerating the controlled vocabulary, and for each term create a class using a hasValue restriction.  </s>
<s> For further clarity and usablility we might want to create two related properties, one indicating the (single) intended subject code, and the other indicating all implicit subject codes formed from the class hierachy.  </s>
<s> The former would be a subproperty of both the latter and dc:subject; the latter would be used to create the hasValue restrictions.  </s>
<s> Hmmm ... quite a lot of work initially, but the end result is that the subject indicators are marked up using text strings from an explicit controlled vocab; we conform with the defn of dc:subject, even with the advertised best practice; we fall within OWL DL with the expectation that this will give us better reasoning performance, and we have been clearer about we are trying to say.  </s>
<s> I think the complexity can be hidden from the end users.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> No, but if the descriptors is a taxonomy or a generalization hierarchy then it is quite natural to identify it with the corresponding subClass hierarchy.  </s>
<s> I agree this is a simplifying identification of two things that can be kept conceptually distinct, but its often handy to do that, especially if you don't have anything very elaborate in mind. .  </s>
<s> Now you are getting into an orthogonal issue, distinguishing between types and tokens of texts.  </s>
<s> Like, Moby Dick the novel (only one of them) vs. all the printed copies of Moby Dick (each of which has many other attributes than the novel and in fact is a completely different kind of thing, eg you can burn one of those but you can't burn a novel.  </s>
<s> But this is orthogonal to the class/instance issue: you can have a class of types and a class of tokens (they are disjoint).  </s>
<s> In fact, the class of classes of abstract texts such as novels might be a handy metaclass.  </s>
