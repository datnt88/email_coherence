mailto' links can be a problem because :- 1. 
They pop-up an email program that the user may not use. 
2. They break checkpoint 10.1, unless there is a clear signal that the link will open the user's email software. 
I have never seen this on a web site. 
On the plus side I have heard that they are helpful because when they do work, the receiver of the email can be sure that the reply email address is correct. 
The alternative is a forms based approach to sending email.

Except that the behavior of a mailto link is totally under the control of the user's user agent (browser) and can/should be configured within the browser if the user the desires. 
Therefore I think this is at worst a problem with user agents, and not a problem with mailto: links at all.

TAKE CONTROL. 
As a user of a regular old graphical browser I find being forced to use a form to send email extremely annoying. 
My email is contained in my email application where I can search and store as I see fit. 
I can easily compose mail and save drafts or mail which needs further considering before sending. 
If I'm forced to send mail via a form this "breaks" my system. 
I generally end up copying and pasting from the form to a regular message I send to myself, thus losing the sender and addressee info. 
In addition, the space on a form is often pathetic, forcing me into annoying scrolling. 
I also hate it when the feedback / email address is kept secret from me via a form. 
I have absolutely no objection to websites which give me a choice between a form and a mailto link.

Depends on your browser. 
:) For example, I can configure Opera 5 to use Opera, an external client, or the system default. 
If there's an argument that more options should be available, then that's an argument for improving user agent support (and not refraining from using mailto: links). 
However, I have not heard of many people who have experienced accessibility problems from using mailto: links. 
Is this a real problem or a theoretical problem?

TAKE CONTROL. 
Hi Kynn Yes I see it in Opera, under File, Preferences, Email As for whether this is a real problem or a theoretical one, I am not sure. 
I personally find it annoying when my browser chooses to launch an email client I don't use (I use web based email), but alternatively in this response Miraz says she doesn't like form based 'email'. 
But these are basically only annoyances that impact on usability. 
I have to make recommendations for the best way to get site feedback in terms of accessibility, so I am on an intelligence gathering exercise. 
The way mailto links are implemented on most sites I have seen does seem to be a breach of checkpoint 10.1 because they don't contain a warning that the current window is about to change.

My personal opinion is that the best way is to give the user a *choice* between launching an email application and filling in a form.

A service of First Bite of the Apple i disagree. 
forms offer a huge advantage for customers because they do not require the user to have an email package and we all know how flaky the email set-ups can be. 
and how they may not work. 
i can go to the library or a public kiosk and be allowed to use email or need to set it up and remove it. 
whereas a form can be used on a public system. 
unfortunately, you will need to get used to forms. 
there are needed for sites that have mail traffic and interaction with the customer. 
form messaging systems greatly reduce the costs of manual processes. 
while some messaging systems can import email information into the database, forms are much more efficient and scalable. 
scalability is the key as well as tracking the message as it gets passed around in the workflow. 
this is for tracking how long i had it and who had it last. 
you must take care of the customer on the response to thier question. 
most systems have this is as a part of Customer Relationship Management systems and they are getting cheaper for mid-level sites to afford, but not fast enough. 
from an implementation aspect, email is not efficient and is a huge burden to manage, whereas, forms are an effective way to manage customer traffic.

A service of First Bite of the Apple By changing your browser, and thus using market forces against the browser developer, if necessary. 
I also find form only systems annoying because: - I'm forced to stay online all the time, potentially accumulating phone charges and tending to produce a worse response because of the haste induced; - I don't get a copy to keep; - the comment may have arisen in work time but I want to reply at home; - with Lynx, I can include the contents of the page in question easily, but in forms mode it is very difficult text only and even GUI it involves opening a new window and cutting and pasting piecemeal; - forms often do not cover the cases that I'm interested in.. 
Although not actually a web feedback context, I've been particularly annoyed recently by certain ISPs that have started only accepting HTTP form input for spamming complaints. 
Generally forcing form input tends to favour the business running the site, note the user. 
In the context of mailto: URLs, rather than feeback forms, I see this as a user agent issue, not a content authoring issue. 
Lynx, for instance, does integrate the email sending function (but a common request at one time was to allow people to use their favourite email program instead). 
i disagree. 
forms offer a huge advantage for customers [snip much excellent content] Well you make some excellent points about the usefulness of forms, but you can't disagree with my being annoyed and frustrated by them as that's my experience. 
Perhaps form design could incorporate measures such as allowing me to send a copy of the email to my own address, and revealing the email address to which the form is being sent (or a sensible contact address for the organisation). 
Forms could also be designed to have sensible sized text areas for extended feedback. 
Cheers, Miraz Tips: http://www.firstbite.co.nz/mactips/ 
A service of First Bite of the Apple As Rob alluded to with Customer Relationship Management systems, forms can provide a way of categorizing and routing responses, or launching workflow processes. 
Another major advantage forms have over e-mail is that they can be designed not to allow attachments. 
In fact, most form systems preclude the use of attachments unless the software has been specifically designed to allow them. 
Attachments can cause all kinds of problems, from their cumulative size raising storage issues to providing an opportunity for attacks through spam/denial-of-service or even viruses. 
Furthermore, E-mail messages are seldom secure, so there is always the risk of allowing improper access to sensitive information. 
As the U.S. government, for privacy reasons we're most often not allowed to ask for and cannot retain e-mail addresses when we do, so most government sites use forms, and many may not even have an associated e-mail address.. To address the frustration that Miraz mentions, it is possible for forms to capture a person's e-mail address, and have the submittal process generate an e-mail message to them which can contain most or all of the information a person has entered on the form. 
Many e-commerce sites generate this type of message as part of an order confirmation.

A service of First Bite of the Apple As a webmaster of several sites, I've observed that when you give users a choice of selecting between a mailto email link and a form, you will get much greater response rate from the form. 
At one website, which averaged 3,000 visitors daily, our "About this site" page had a mailto email link for the webmaster. 
We averaged about 2 - 3 emails daily. 
When we changed the page so the visitors had the option of filling out a form, the webmaster email volume increased to 10 - 15 daily. 
Your mileage, of course, may vary. 
This becomes important if you plan to have an accessibility page on your web site. 
An accessibility page should give users an opportunity to report any accessibility problems that they may have using the website, so that feedback method should be as accessible as possible. 
Personally I dislike and never use the mailto email link. 
First, it is a hassle to configure one's browser to send email. 
Secondly, public computers at a school or library are often disabled so that sending email this way is not permitted (I used to work within the Arlington, VA library system and we did disable this). 
And finally, someone browsing the web from work may not want to send mail and be indentified by their work email address. 
However, I agree with Miraz that users should be offered a choice - either the mailto email link or the form.

A service of First Bite of the Apple Graham, Please may I second what Miraz and David have said. 
Here is the key point for customer care, or the quality benefits that you gain from gathering feedback.? The people with the answers most always see the world through a more fine-grained set of pigeonholes than do the people with the questions or complaints [That's a FAQ]. 
For emotional and "comfortable language" considerations, you always want to give the customer room to vent in their own terms, without forcing them to cram what they have to say into a set of narrow pigeonholes.? 
This implies accepting email feedback.? 
This is costly,? 
It is a lot cheaper to run a form and just look at the spreadsheet of the aggregated form results, but you get what you pay for.? Forms and spreadsheets will not tell you about usability or accessibility issues with your site that you probably did not anticipate in your design and your form, or you wouldn't have the problem. 
Because the implementation of mailto: URLs is spotty, you should really have an email address in the plain text of the page as well as automation using a if you wish. 
But Miraz is right.? You should offer the user a choice.? Here is an area where the technology does not capture enough of the user preference distribution into one technical approach for you to rely entirely on one technique.? People's comfort levels with different technologies amenable to feedback vary all over the lot.? If you really want to hear from people, you will tool up for multiple modes to cover that diversity. 
AND, while we are on it, the usability problems for forms for people with disabilities are severe enough at this time so that if you do choose to implement a feedback form only, you are significantly hurting your chances of hearing from this constituency.? At least if you look at the penetration studies of the AFB for people with visual disabilities, I believe that you will find many more are fully at home sending an email as compared with how comfortable they are filling out a form. 
Al Graham, Have a look at mine, then: http://hshelp.com/ - is that clear enough? 
(There should be an email link on every page.) (I'm planning to redesign and extend the whole site, it was designed with only "naive" ideas about accessibility; although the late Len Kasday was "disappointed" when his Wave tool could not find any real problems with it ;-) Cheers, Marjolein Katsma HomeSite Help - http://hshelp.com/ Bookstore for Webmasters - http://hshelp.com/bookstore/bookstore.html Joy, I'd suggest you investigate to what extent this is related to the nature and purpose of the website, and what type of visitors it caters for or attracts. 
Personally, that's the only thing I will even consider using, unless I really have a feally urgent missive and cannot find an email link anywhere! 
Cheers, Marjolein Katsma HomeSite Help - http://hshelp.com/ Bookstore for Webmasters - http://hshelp.com/bookstore/bookstore.html Graham, I agree with Miraz - If I cannot find an email address (If I really need to I may spend uop to half an hour poking around a site to find one!) or find a waty to send *myself* a copy from a web-based form, I either do not send a message, or do not buy the product, or whatever. 
It has to be really, really URGENT to get me to use a form in such a case. 
If you're seeking the "best way to get feedback", a web form is not the way, in my opinion: you'll have people electing not to send any feedback, because the can't keep a record of what they're sending to whom. 
The best alternative would probably be to provide both an email link and a form. 
BTW, I also encode a page name for the subject in the email links for my sites: that way I'll know what people are actually commenting on - at least in most cases. 
That's somewhat harder to do if you have access to server-side programming, and impossible if you don't.

One thing that no-one seems to have mentioned in this thread is the problem with email address scraping. 
On my sites I usually provide a form for all the reasons already mentioned. 
It guides the user and let's him/her know what information we need to adequately process his/her request. 
It doesn't require familiarity with an email program. 
And it can be used from any browser. 
But I also provide an email address in a mailto: link at the bottom of every page on the site (two, usually: one for the company and one for the webmaster). 
And I provide an email address in plain text on the form page at the least and usually at the bottom of every page. 
Then I sit back and wait for the spam. 
I agree that it is important to give users as much flexibility as possible when replying to a site. 
(With most sites, I'm happy if they provide *any* method for giving feedback -- lots don't.) But the more complex the system gets, the more it costs to maintain it, as Al mentioned. 
What Al didn't say is that increasing the cost of one function means taking money from others. 
There will be trade-offs involved. 
What user feature should we leave off to pay for the extra cost of our customer service features? 
I don't think it's cut and dried -- it really needs to be looked at on a case basis. 
But we should acknowledge that some sites deliberately hide email addresses by using forms, and they do so because they want to minimize spam. 
Any solutions to the spam problem? 
How can I include an email address that the user can read, but an address-scraping agent cannot? 
Any suggestions for how to provide the flexibility of both mailto and forms without significantly increasing the costs (and thus giving up other features)? 
(Note: IMO the priorities on most sites are all screwed up already, so freeing up money for better customer service handling might be just a matter of getting the priorities straight. 
For the above question, however, I am assuming that we've distributed our funds in a reasonably wise manner already and that spending more on customer service will result in giving up a *useful* function.

They need a "text" email address in your page source) code. 
All you need to do is to URL-encode the email address (even partially: just encoding the '@' would already fool most crapers); most email clients (as opposed to scraping robots) have no problem with it. 
(Some links checkers do - ignore them.) 
In fact, this is *so* easy (and well-published) I did not even think of mentioning it. 
Once your address has been scraped, it's precious little use "hiding" it though: it just gets passed around by spammers - on those fancy CD's you get al the spam about!
