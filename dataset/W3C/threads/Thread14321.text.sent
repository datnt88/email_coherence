Gregg, This came up on the conference call today. 
Here's information on this topic from Mark Hakkinen on the UA list [1] (sent 24 November 1999): pwWebSpeak allows synthesizer language changing for the page under these conditions: 1. 
The LANG attribute is specified in the HTML element. 
2. The LANG attribute corresponds to one of the installed synthesizer languages. 
Users can manually switch the "reading" synthesizer to one of the installed languages, if no LANG attribute is present. 
Presently we don't switch on LANG attributes within a page (though we are likely to add that). 
We do note significant time delays when switching between some synthesizers (eg, some SAPI engines may exhibit a long load time, particularly when using engines from different vendors). 
That has been a concern of mine if we switch on arbitrary LANG attributes appearing in the page as it could introduce unnatural reading flow. 
From Jim Thatcher (24 November 1999) [2]: Home Page Reader does the same and plans the same.

Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Sorry everyone, but I missed the meeting today... Mother Nature blessed us with severe thunderstorms, and not only was my power out, but I was also in the midst of several lightning strikes every few minutes, so I decided discretion was the better part of valor and chose not to call in. 
Marshall.

Gregg and Ian, In addition (besides the lang attribute of the HTML element), HPR can be set to "automatic language detection" whereby it attempts to determine the language of the page. 
If HPR is fairly sure of the language and if that language is supported, HPR switches to the language for reading the page. 
Such analysis is only done for the whole page. 
There is no switching mid-page except by user choice.
