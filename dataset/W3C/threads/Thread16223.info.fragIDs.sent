<s> Whether section 508 will have much of an impact is still out to the jury in my mind.  </s>

<s> All,  </s>
<s> I have been following this discussion with some amusement and some consternation.  </s>
<s> I am wondering if the person who says the force of law will produce gruding compliance, has ever had find a restroom that could accomdate their wheelchair?  </s>
<s> The Web is no longer a separate and distinct entity.  </s>
<s> It is more and more becoming a part of everyday life.  </s>
<s> With that in mind it should be clear that tne only way some organizations will comply with making things accessible is by the force of law.  </s>
<s> This is not directed at those who would do it anyway.  </s>
<s> I have seen estimates that some 70-90 % of web sites are inaccessible.  </s>
<s> Now whether these figures are accurate is not the point, the point is that many web sites are not accessible, and people with disabilities are being separated from others and denied access to vital products and services.  </s>
<s> The fact is that this will make a bad situation ( 80-90% of people with disabilties who can work are unemployed or underemployed) even worse.  </s>
<s> All the academic arguments in the world will not change this.  </s>
<s> If the force of law was not necessary to level the playing field then the ADA would have been unecessary.  </s>
<s> As it stands it has not done enough.  </s>
<s> Again I suspect that many who rail against the force of law are neither disabled nor unemployed.  </s>
<s> I suggest that they take a good long look at the figures about this situation and re assess their postition.  </s>
<s> Let me add this as well, I would rather have people gainfully employed and paying taxes than on social security and being supported by those who do work.  </s>
<s> Most of the folks I know on SSI feel the same way.  </s>
<s> Just for the record I am disabled and employed.  </s>

<s> CM:: "I think that attempts to rigorously enforce general accessibility, whether through litigation or criminal proceedings, will give accessibility a bad name and hinder efforts to make the Web a better place."  </s>
<s> WL: Several decades ago a couple of authors had the effect of testing whether their passions *needed* "enforcement" or could happen through persuasion/education: Rachel Carson and Ralph Nader.  </s>
<s> Until the "2X4" approach ensued the efforts were essentially futile.  </s>
<s> Substitute "environmentalism" and "auto safety" for "accessibility" in the argument and see what ensues.  </s>
<s> Perhaps their success in creating huge bureaucracies and "government intervention" gave these fields a "bad name" but cars are safer and less poison abounds, IMHO.  </s>
<s> "Voting with your feet" is just as often an excuse for continued sociopathic behaviour as it is an effective means of effecting significant change.  </s>
<s> In a society that still uses "blind" as a pejorative, we shouldn't have to wait another millenium for people to "get it" and the Web is as public as the airspace and waterways.  </s>
<s> Anarchy is a nice idea but at the moment there is some possibility of using enforcement for education, distasteful as the prospect may be.  </s>
<s> "Market forces" totally unregulated by "government (of the people) interference" might very well be a better choice when those in charge think deaf people are stupid and people in wheel chairs are "confined" to them.  </s>
<s> While "educating" everyone otherwise is all well and good, unless you must go stand in the corner when you're "bad", you will keep on throwing spitballs when the teacher's back is turned.  </s>
<s> As to the "Enforcement *can't* work - my philosophical disagreement with it is moot": without "enforcement" we'd still have a society in which women and people of color couldn't vote and gay men would have to pretend they were entirely butch.  </s>
<s> Even if I can't expect the protocols for posting stuff on the Web don't ever get to the point where they preclude inaccessible materials' inclusion, I can sure "vote with my vote" to get people in place who make it likelier.  </s>
<s> And, yes, this will include *some* "government interference" because WE are the government.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> No, I haven't.  </s>
<s> I assume your point is that it's now fairly easy, at least in public buildings, thanks to the ADA.  </s>
<s> If not, then I'm not sure I understand.  </s>
<s> But I feel that there is a fundamental difference between the physical world and the Internet which radically changes the legal game in ways that make the bathroom metaphor break down.  </s>
<s> For starters, there's the matter of jurisdiction.  </s>
<s> A building in San Francisco is unquestionably in the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco, the State of California, and the USA.  </s>
<s> If the building's management finds the ADA onerous, they may complain, they may drag their heels, but they'll have to comply eventually because they can't just move the building management concern out of the affected jurisdiction.  </s>
<s> But what jurisdiction is, say, canada.com  </s>
<s> in?  </s>
<s> The domain is adminstered by Network Solutions, Inc., a US entity, but the contact address for the domain is in Ontario, with network service through AT&amp;T of Canada.  </s>
<s> If their Web site isn't compliant when a US user tries to use it, who enforces the guidelines?  </s>
<s> For that matter, whose guidelines are used?  </s>
<s> Now consider the case of a large company, say Microsoft, who has the facilities to simply move their Web services offshore (say, to HavenCo).  </s>
<s> Whose jurisdiction are they in then?  </s>
<s> Then there's the matter of violation detection.  </s>
<s> In meatspace, there are building codes and regular inspections; the buildings in a city can be enumerated and visited sequentially.  </s>
<s> Even assuming that the WACG are adopted globally, it's trivial to create a page that passes any computer-driven test of the page without actually being accessible.  </s>
<s> No government has the resources to monitor the entire Internet manually.  </s>
<s> So it'll be left to individuals with standing to pursue enforcement, whether by litigation or by pushing for prosecution.  </s>
<s> In these cases, I can't see how the resources exist to pursue multiple instances of what would likely be lengthy trials if the defendants were stubborn in the slightest.  </s>
<s> Add to that the fact that many Web sites undergo complete redesigns, starting from scratch, and enforcement becomes next to impossible.  </s>
<s> Only an organization with a real commitment to accessible content can sustain accessibility through these redesigns.  </s>
<s> Which brings me to my final point: human nature.  </s>
<s> People really do not like being told what to do.  </s>
<s> With a gun pointed at their head (which is what any law not completely irrelevant comes down to), they will do as they are told.  </s>
<s> But if detection, jurisdiction, and enforcement are that difficult, who holds the gun and where does it point?  </s>
<s> Making threats which will, in most cases, amount to a bluff, will only irritate content creators.  </s>
<s> Education will produce content creators that understand the tangible benefits of accessibility; as JM Straczynski wrote, "The universe is composed of matter, energy, and enlightened self-interest."  </s>
<s> I appreciate the work that's going into accessibility education, by the W3C and others.  </s>
<s> I think that the work on legislation is counterproductive, though, and that adding those energies to the education effort instead would have a greatly increased benefit.  </s>
<s> One thing that's become clearer and clearer to me is that the curb cut metaphor cuts quite deep; navigational tools for people with limited vision or mobility limitations make for more effective computer use by everyone, and information design theory for people with cognitive challenges creates information more effectively consumed by everyone.  </s>
<s> This is the message that really needs to get out.  </s>

<s> You'd be surprised at what a law in this country can do to effect the way others do business with us.  </s>

<s> The effect on MicroSoft of Massachusetts' refusal to buy products a few years back was followed closely (according to MS, coincidentally rather than as a result of g ) by major steps towards improved accessibility of their products.  </s>
<s> The same thing is happening due to Section 508.  </s>
<s> As to the impossibility of enforcement - so what?  </s>
<s> If the feds won't buy Web services from companies that don't produce compliant sites, the companies will trumpet their conformance.  </s>
<s> If ADA is invoked at any level it's more significant that compliance increases, not that prosecutions result.  </s>
<s> Legislative/regulatory efforts are educational.  </s>
<s> It's a shame that Chris doesn't feel a part of the "government", but some of us do and hold that unless these entities provide guidance in these matters the results will be meager from other means of communicating any of these issues.  </s>
<s> The metaphor of curb cuts will be remarked upon by media much more prominently after legislative notoriety calls it to their attention better than a gaggle of press releases from some obscure standards setting consortium.  </s>
