<s> DOM Level 2 doesn't model most of the DTD.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 3's "Abstract Schema" chapter is intended to adress that area.  </s>
<s> Some parsers have custom solutions that they've built for use in the meantime.  </s>
<s> There are certainly DTD-directed XML editors, which seem to be what you're looking for.  </s>
