I would like to thank Tim Stephen Springer for the answer to the mouse over/colour change question. 
"To this end the new relesase of the diagnostic software we are working on does take the hover psuedo attribute into effect when distinguishing color contrast. 
That [the psuedo attribute] is what forces the color change when a user moves their mouse over a link." 
This however begs the question to be re-asked "does Bobby take colors into account" the answer is what I suspected from the start. 
Therefore it is perfectly possible (without being devious or rather imaginative) to obtain a bobby approval rating for an totally inaccessible site, after all how many sites provide a text only version for back up? 
This leads on to what I was saying weeks ago, and got shot down over (temporarily, humph.) via private e-mail. 
Bobby as a tool is great, the rating however is academic, the objective is accessibility. 
Therefore too much importance is attached to this rating. 
How I would love to copy this topic to Dial UK, but will resist the temptation. 
Another question. 
Recently I wrote an article on the AOL/ NFB issue, I then highlighted the get out clauses in red. 
This posed us a problem of how to convey that these sentences are in red, without affecting the visual versions' readability. 
I am sure this is elementary stuff, err, any suggestions?

To convey information to a screen reader without affecting a "normal" sighted browser, use alt text in a small transparent (or page background-colored) image. 
Such as: img src="spacer.gif" 
width="1" height="1" alt="The following sentance is of extreme importance." 
In a visual browser, the user will not see the alt text, even if the images are turned off since the alt text only shows within the size allocated for the image. 
They could see the alt text through the mouse-over effect, but only if they managed to put thier cursor over that one individual pixel. 
I have also thought of using this at the very top-left of pages, making the image a link, and having it say something like "For an accessible, text-only site follow this link." - Ben Morris Active Matter Another question.

The attachment of "importance" is hard to evaluate. 
The makers of Bobby suffer no delusions that a Bobby icon, or even its underlying "approval", are more than mild indicators of good intentions. 
Any tool attempting to evaluate accessibility or its necessary but not sufficient cousin, conformance, is always known by its authors to be on very shaky ground. 
If a bunch of sites sneak by with blatantly inaccessible features, at least we're going to get more alt tags? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Paul, You could add a class to those sections ( span class="ww" the get out bit /span or p class="ww" a wholoe paragraph /p in HTML) along with a style that makes those things red, or loud, or whatever (according to the media used). 
Alternatively you could emphasise them ( p some em get out stuff /em /p ) since the em element has a default rendering in most systems. 
If you wanted to you could put a class attribute on the em element ( em class="ww" ). 
Either way, you could provide a style for the element that made it red, or in a squeaky voice, or whatever. 
This question should be answered in the Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS - since it is about how to meet checkpoint 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
