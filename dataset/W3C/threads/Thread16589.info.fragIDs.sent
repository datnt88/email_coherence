<s> I would like to thank Tim Stephen Springer for the answer to the mouse over/colour change question.  </s>
<s> "To this end the new relesase of the diagnostic software we are working on does take the hover psuedo attribute into effect when distinguishing color contrast.  </s>
<s> That [the psuedo attribute] is what forces the color change when a user moves their mouse over a link."  </s>
<s> This however begs the question to be re-asked "does Bobby take colors into account" the answer is what I suspected from the start.  </s>
<s> Therefore it is perfectly possible (without being devious or rather imaginative) to obtain a bobby approval rating for an totally inaccessible site, after all how many sites provide a text only version for back up?  </s>
<s> This leads on to what I was saying weeks ago, and got shot down over (temporarily, humph.) via private e-mail.  </s>
<s> Bobby as a tool is great, the rating however is academic, the objective is accessibility.  </s>
<s> Therefore too much importance is attached to this rating.  </s>
<s> How I would love to copy this topic to Dial UK, but will resist the temptation.  </s>
<s> Another question.  </s>
<s> Recently I wrote an article on the AOL/ NFB issue, I then highlighted the get out clauses in red.  </s>
<s> This posed us a problem of how to convey that these sentences are in red, without affecting the visual versions' readability.  </s>
<s> I am sure this is elementary stuff, err, any suggestions?  </s>

<s> To convey information to a screen reader without affecting a "normal" sighted browser, use alt text in a small transparent (or page background-colored) image.  </s>
<s> Such as: img src="spacer.gif"  </s>
<s> width="1" height="1" alt="The following sentance is of extreme importance."  </s>
<s> In a visual browser, the user will not see the alt text, even if the images are turned off since the alt text only shows within the size allocated for the image.  </s>
<s> They could see the alt text through the mouse-over effect, but only if they managed to put thier cursor over that one individual pixel.  </s>
<s> I have also thought of using this at the very top-left of pages, making the image a link, and having it say something like "For an accessible, text-only site follow this link." - Ben Morris Active Matter Another question.  </s>

<s> I am sure this is elementary stuff, err, any suggestions?  </s>
<s> Therefore too much importance is attached to this rating.  </s>
<s> The attachment of "importance" is hard to evaluate.  </s>
<s> The makers of Bobby suffer no delusions that a Bobby icon, or even its underlying "approval", are more than mild indicators of good intentions.  </s>
<s> Any tool attempting to evaluate accessibility or its necessary but not sufficient cousin, conformance, is always known by its authors to be on very shaky ground.  </s>
<s> If a bunch of sites sneak by with blatantly inaccessible features, at least we're going to get more alt tags?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Paul, You could add a class to those sections ( span class="ww" the get out bit /span or p class="ww" a wholoe paragraph /p in HTML) along with a style that makes those things red, or loud, or whatever (according to the media used).  </s>
<s> Alternatively you could emphasise them ( p some em get out stuff /em /p ) since the em element has a default rendering in most systems.  </s>
<s> If you wanted to you could put a class attribute on the em element ( em class="ww" ).  </s>
<s> Either way, you could provide a style for the element that made it red, or in a squeaky voice, or whatever.  </s>
<s> This question should be answered in the Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS - since it is about how to meet checkpoint 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
