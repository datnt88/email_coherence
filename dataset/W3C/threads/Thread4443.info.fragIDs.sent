I suggest that the functions in 10.2.3 and 10.2.4 be named consistently. 
The better option seems to me to be to call the function in 10.2.3 the get-namespace-uri-from-QName.

It's worth pointing out that if we are to follow the terminology of the Namespaces rec, as you suggest in your other comments, then we should speak of the "namespace name" rather than the "namespace URI". 
Unfortunately this would be rather confusing since the name of a namespace node is not the namespace URI (namespace name) but the namespace prefix.... My view is that the terms "local name" and "namespace URI" have become accepted through usage; they were used in XPath 1.0 and have not caused users any problems that I am aware of.

We have agreed to rename the fn:get-namespace-from-QName function to fn:get-namespace-uri-from-QName.
