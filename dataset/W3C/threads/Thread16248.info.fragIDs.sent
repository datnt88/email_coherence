More to the point, are there still jobs out there for people who don't kow 
anything about accessible web design? 
(I guess there are, but it seems like a 
bad idea to me - kind of like an architect who doesn't know how to put doors 
into a building, and doesn't really think they're that important...) There are a couple of places where people try to track accessibility-aware 
web designers, but I don't have a URI off the top of my head. 
Charles McCN Not that I'm looking for a job myself, but which companies are out there who specifically look for experts in accessible web design or related technologies? 
I know some of the big computer companies do -- IBM, Sun, Microsoft -- and some research groups (universities, etc). 
Beyond those, is there much market for an accessibility-trained webmaster?

I've participated in a couple of recent candidate interviews for positions that involve web design. 
None of the candidates has shown an awareness of accessibility as an issue to be addressed, let alone how to go about it. 
This is in higher education, with candidates mostly just out of school; should I hope the private sector is doing things better?

I hope the private sector is doing better. 
But I am not sure if they are. 
I realise that there are not too many webmasters out there who understand accessibility, but there is some call for them. 
I know in Australia that it is now a feature in some fairly big contracts, although by no means all of them.
