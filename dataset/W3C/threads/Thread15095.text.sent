Hi, For some months now I have been reading with great interest the debate that has raged. 
Quite frankly I haven't participated before because someone else usually had the same viewpoint. 
The issue of multiple versions of a page has however seemed to be missing 1 point. 
If you have already covered this, then I apologise - just ignore this email. 
Focusing on abilities is better than focusing on disabilities. 
It's important to remember that very often particularly if the disability is intellectual or cognitive, that it is accompanied by other disabilities. 
For example, my son has Down Syndrome, autism, a moderate hearing loss and probably photo-sensitive epilepsy. 
He also has no depth perception and requires glasses to read. 
All I'm really saying is - consider the possibility of more than one disability. 
Easier said than done I know - since I don't know how to program for that either. 
It's nice to finally talk to you all and thank you for the significant effort you are all putting in to helping people like my son. Lee Otto Lee Otto ASPECT Ph: (02) 6245 8133 MIMEsweeper has been used to check this email for security TO:Lee.Otto@aspect.com.au,w3c-wai-gl@w3.org 
Hi, I think Lee is right, and one major problem with having multiple versions of a web page is that we can NEVER know the variety of disabilities a person may have, and therefore splitting an accessible web site into several sites can end up making that site essentially inaccessible. 
What I mean, is that if someone needs checkpoints A and B to access a site will not be able to do so if checkpoint A is solved by Site Version 1, and checkpoint B by Site Version 3. Cheers, Gian Hi, Here's an example of the ways the technology world outside of the disabled community is looking at technology to support individualization of web experience. 
A person's disability would be just another factor in the decision making process. 
Scott Subject: Call for papers: Adaptive Systems for Web Based Education Dear colleagues: Please find attached (and if possible distribute) the call for papers for: WASWBE'02: Workshop on Adaptive Systems for Web Based Education In conjunction with 2nd International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems (http://www.lcc.uma.es/AH2002) 
May 28, 2002. 
M?laga, SPAIN Workshop Description: Web-based education is currently a hot research and development area. 
Benefits of Web-based education are clear at hand: learners from all over the world can enroll in learning activities, communicate with other students or teachers, can discuss and control their learning progress - solely based on an internet-capable computer. 
A challenging research goal is to tailor the access to web-based education systems to the individual learners' needs, as determined by such factors as their previous knowledge on the subject, their learning style, their general attitude and/or their cultural or linguistic background. 
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of recent trends and perspectives in adaptive systems for web-based education, and thus to continue the series of workshops on this topic held at past conferences, e.g. : AIED'97 http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~plb/AIED97_workshop,

Hi, I think there's another way to look at some of the accessibility issues. 
I believe there are more dominant aspects and less dominant aspects and ways to do some bundling of requirements. 
A critical factor is use of mainly text as compared to a more visual format. 
If there are additional requirements such as the text version doesn't use javascript (or severely limitis its use in various ways), the text version doesn't use tables except for formatting table, the text version has a very linear format; the format can be used to provide accessibility in a number of ways. 
Scott Hi, The point of conflicts is very well taken as is the need for a variety of server side renderings. 
I'm not sure that the concept of "basic accessibility" is well understood. 
Scott Sometimes one item conflicts for different user gropes eg: use of jargon (good for some bad for others), more multimedia items less words (see feedback on 3.3 email), using color to emphasize structure against a black and white page that is good for people without any cone vision. 
etc etc. Keeping basic accessibility on all accessible renderings but having any amount of sever side automatic renderings, optimized to different scenarios, is to me, state of the art accessibility. 
Have a look at our home page if you are still not convinced. 
All the best, Lisa Sometimes one item conflicts for different user gropes eg: use of jargon (good for some bad for others), more multimedia items less words (see feedback on 3.3 email), using color to emphasize structure against a black and white page that is good for people without any cone vision. 
etc etc. Keeping basic accessibility on all accessible renderings but having any amount of sever side automatic renderings, optimized to different scenarios, is to me, state of the art accessibility. 
Have a look at our home page if you are still not convinced. 
All the best, Lisa Well, this needs to be balanced against the fact that a specialised version might be many times more accessible for a given group. 
I think that the method of getting around different versions of the same content needs always to cover "everything", and that the accessibility in general of a given resource is only as good as the general accessibility available in a given version of that resource. 
But within these constraints there are ways of providing multiple "views" of a single resource taht are useful in different contexts. 
In the development of content for mobile devices all this is taken as "given". 
But there they make the false assumption that knowing what the browser is defines what the user needs - in accessibility users lie about what browser they have, for good reason, and browsers are not always able to know what is between them and an end user - one approach to assistive technology which has been followed for many years makes that more or less impossible. 
On the other hand, CC/PP provides an architectural model (currently lacking in any techniques or appropriate vocabulary definitions) that could be used to solve this problem too for many cases that are currently more or less intractable.

Cheers, Gian Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hi, I'm not sure I would agree with this analysis. 
I think there are some inherent groupings of functionality. 
For example, in general, the major group of people which is affected by tables for layout is pretty much the same group affected by javascript. 
Scott I think the scenarios being discussed in this thread are rather more limited than those which current and developing technologies are intended to support. 
In particular, instead of considering what would be the consequences of having, for example, three or four "different versions" of a page, it would be more realistic to conceive of a page generation mechanism which customizes the output sent to the user agent, based on a profile. 
This profile may include details of user agent characteristics (e.g., the kind of device on which the content is to be rendered) as well as expressions of user preference. 
It may be supplied manually by the user or automatically with CC/PP or other protocols. 
Under these conditions, the output can be constructed to take account of multiple needs, and a fortiori multiple disabilities, by including all of the required features in accordance with the profile, and the problem which is being discussed on this thread is solved, provided the server supports all of the necessary adaptations. 
Of course, it is likely that there will be some adaptations which won't be widely supported by web servers. 
For example, braille coding and formatting can only be carried out adequately by specialized software, which, I expect, most web content developers won't obtain and install on their servers (of course the vendors of such software would no doubt prefer otherwise). 
Rather, this adaptation will take place at the "user agent" end, or perhaps in a specialized proxy server under the control of the user or of a third-party organization. 
To allow for this possibility, it can be argued that content developers should provide one options (that is, one profile) whereby a semantically rich version of the content, suitable for adaptation by other software further along the delivery chain. 
In fact, there is already interest in this area, including specifications that allow the originating server to impose constraints, for intellectual property or other reasons, on the types of adaptations to which the content may be subjected as it traverses the delivery path from the server, through any intermediate proxies, to the user agent. 
Hi, I think Jason has a point about supporting a greater range of complexity. 
However, I think it would be helpful if there was better understanding of three or four basic pages in order that users don't have to make a lot of choices. 
A reasonable approach might be where the user can choose some basic model and then fine tune the model if desired. 
Scott The profiles can, I expect, be largely constructed by the user agent, with some input from the user to fine-tune the preferences. 
They are then expressed in CC/PP or another suitable format and transmitted to servers as resources are requested. 
The range of options might include: 1. Various forms of HTML/XHTML. 2. XSL formatting objects optimized for the output device. 
3. WML or XHTML basic for mobile devices. 
4. Speech Synthesis Markup Language, speech grammars and dialogues. 
5. SVG graphics as well as other raster-based image formats. 
6. 
Other high-level XML formats. 
All of these options (notably items 1-5, above) are supported by specifications that have already been agreed upon or are under development within the W3C. 
Our guidelines need to be suitable for an environment, in the not too distant future, in which these technologies are available and increasingly utilized. 
It is important to remember that the guidelines, as they are intended to become a W3C Recommendation, must be designed with long-term stability in mind, which implies that, at the very least, current and emerging technologies need to be taken fully into account. 
For the moment I think the most important area affected will be our conformance scheme, but it will also be necessary to develop techniques that are relevant to these technologies. 
I am sure that there are a number of "reasonably obvious" functionality groupings. 
I assume that the first thing we will see is the "reasonably obvious" ones catered for, and later we will see more adaptive systems designed to better provide for the needs of a wide range of people. 
There is old technology available to do this. 
The real question in my mind is how to make sure that people are getting a version they can use, and then how to make sure they can get the version that is best for them to use.

Why aren't they documented anywhere? 
The problem with reasonable grouping as I see it is that it doesn?t allow for multiple disabilities -- cause they are random. 
A person can have any mix or subset of Low vision (many types) Blindness Hearing Impairments (many types) Deafness Physical disabilities (many types) Cognitive disabilities Language disabilities Seizure disorders Or all of the above (and I have had clients with all of the above) Since you can have any combination, how can you have 'logical groupings" of access features? 
I LIKE server side tuning for different combinations of the above. 
But unless we have a very sophisticated means to ask, discuss, negotiate and come up with the right combination of features ---- for all browsers (or a vast majority ) then we need to have a default, cross disability accessible version --- don?t we?

On Behalf systems Definitely, but keep in mind that those are no more likely to solve the problems of multiple disabilities than anything else. 
We need to be careful not to think that a single "accessible" version is a magic bullet. 
The problem of complex disability needs still exists no matter how many versions you have. 
Restricting yourself to one (as some would do) is less of a solution than adding 5 more to that one.

Well, I suspect that one reason why they are not widely documented is that what is in fact obvious varies wildly according to the specific situation - the technology being used, the skills and experiences of the person deciding what groupings to support, etc. Chaals I am sure there are some "reasonably obvious" groupings. 
Why aren't they documented anywhere? 
Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hi, I think it would be helpful to first take a stab at some of the functionality groupings before trying to determine that the people are getting the version they can use. 
The nature of the groupings might influence how a user can request them. 
A second question that comes into mind is what is the definition of "best version" for a user. 
How much different is "best" as compared to "sufficient"? 
Scott Hi, Perhaps, one possibility is that there was an initial assumption was that the best approach to web page accessibility was for there to be only one version of a web page. 
This could be an example of a chosen value limiting analysis of alternative approaches. 
Scott Hi, I think one clustering of attributes or functionality might include: a standard linear format no javascript tables not used for format, only for data no images, only descriptions which are links to images no flash, etc, but links to flash elements I'd also like to see some of the categorization tested in terms of accessibility rather than just than being based on opinions. 
For example, time disabled people using general web pages as compared to how efficient they are using based pages based on categorization. 
Scott Hi, This kind of goes back to some hard issues of values. 
Is it appropriate to make something harder for a person with a single disability because they may have the same disability as someone who has additional disabilities or is it appropriate to make it harder for someone with multiple disabilities than it is for someone with a single disability? 
A naive answer might be that designers can make it equally easy for both people. 
While this might be achievable in some situations, it is most likely requires additional resources to accomplish this. 
Forcing the use of a single web page format brings up these questions. 
I think that until some effort is put into looking at various potential categorizations, it probably doesn't make sense to look at how to handle such aspects of user/browser specification of features. 
Scott If this thread is to make any further progress, someone needs to write a proposal related to the guidelines. 
Here is what we know so far: 1. Server-side techniques are already being worked on. 
Those who are interested, but not already involved, should contact Wendy Chisholm wendy@w3.org 
to coordinate. 
2. It is agreed by everyone involved that server-side techniques will have an impact upon the nature of our conformance scheme, most significantly in determining how content for which multiple versions exist can satisfy the guidelines and how a conformance claim should be scoped to ensure that the information it provides regarding the accessibility of the content is useful and accurate. 
Does anybody want to write a proposal in relation to either or both of these issues? 
Are there any other issues in this area that ought to be discussed? 
If so, how do they affect the guidelines? 
Yes, I think if we can define some obvious groupings, and explain who is the group that requires this obvious grouping, then we will be further along the track. 
I saw your grouping, but I think it needs to say "who benefits", and how there are two groups, one of whom benefits from this, and one of whom loses something by having this kind of grouping. 
The question of the difference between best and sufficient is an interesting one. 
It should be extended in my opinion - what are the differnces between getting a best version, getting a sufficient version, and getting an unusable version? 
How can we descriobe ways of getting the best experience possible for everyone, while making sure that at no stage we lead to people having an unusable experience? 
cheers Chaals Hi, I think it would be helpful to first take a stab at some of the functionality groupings before trying to determine that the people are getting the version they can use. 
The nature of the groupings might influence how a user can request them. 
A second question that comes into mind is what is the definition of "best version" for a user.

Scott Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hi, I think that the grouping I started describing would benefit screen reader users. 
Users who have older browser technology, slower connections or PDA's could also benefit. 
Another group who might benefit is the web page developers. 
The reason why I mention web site developers is that they might be able to reduce the amount of effort needed to determine the accessibility of web pages. 
For example, the web site developer could go through various cycles of determining how web pages "linearize" and fixing problems identified. 
Or they could just create web pages which don't use tables and that reduces amount of linearization checking that needs to be done. 
I may not sure who loses with this grouping if another version of the web page is developed. 
Maybe part of the question is identifying what is lost and how critical that loss is to functionality. 
I think the extension to "unusable" is pretty good. 
Maybe, we are discussing a range from "best" to "sufficient" to "barely usable" to "unusable". 
Scott Hi, I think it might be helpful to first discuss groupings. 
The results of that discussion would influence the direction that any proposal might go. 
Scott This probably already is included in the second point of your agenda, but I would add to the list as a reminder that we should also examine the use of good techniques for storing and updating the content and keeping track which data is related so that it becomes less easy to update content in one version and forget to update it in another. 
For instance, the content should be taken from the same source whenever possible for all the versions and CSS and different transformations e.g. table linearizer may be used to modify the presentation and interaction if needed. 
Furthermore, if sound track is replaced the designer should be warned to check the accuracy of related captions and if an image is replaced the designer is given the places referring to it in the main text body that should be checked. 
In these cases the user writing the document has defined (hopefully with a good tool) which caption is related to which soundtrack or which places in the text explain the image. 
Always providing one version where the maximum amount of interaction flexibility (for all disabilities) is available is probably a good idea. 
The user can then optimize it himself or herself with some fine tuning as users do right now. 
The other versions mainly provide selected user groups an easy, ready made optimization. 
Marja Hi, My suspicion is that there might be two or three main categories of versions of web pages. 
One useful approach would be for authoring tools to keep enough information to automatically generate these various versions of a web page. 
For web pages which are generated dynamically as needed, the issue of content being updated becomes more an issue of updating the data storage which is used for providing the information for the web pages being generated. 
Scott Hi, There was a recent posting on CHI-WEB about a web page with an article called "Text-only is not accessible". 
The web page is at: Now an interesting aspect of this web page is that in the upper right corner of the web page there is a link labeled "accessible". 
This links the user to a web page with the same article in a format designed to be more accessible. 
With regards to our discussion of multiple versions, I was thinking it might be interesting to get some comments about what different people's experiences are using the different versions. 
One of the aspects I'd be interested in hearing about is differences in speed or efficiency. 
Scott Interesting example. 
Actually, as a visual user of a text-only browser I found both versions the same to use. 
Which seemed to argue the author's point that a single version works best. 
However, I think that a better test would be to use a whole site, not just a single page. 
Does anyone have some examples of functional sites that can be tested like this? 
I would like to spend more of my time reading the newspaper. 
The newspaper I would like to read is the Age, published in Melbourne, and it is available online in 3 versions - standard, text and handheld. 
I think it might be instructive for anyone who has time to read the paper 2 or 3 times a day for a few weeks to compare these versions: standard: http://www.theage.com.au/ text: http://www.theage.com.au/text/index.html 
handheld: http://www.theage.com.au/handheld/index.html 
From my preliminary look, one of the things that I wonder about is finding my way between them. 
It took a lot of searching to discover that these other versions were available, and I wonder how someone using the handheld version can give me a pointer to an article in the most appropriate way for em to find it in my preferred version.

Scott Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hi, Here's a note I posted to CHI-WEB about the article: Scott Hi, I think the article "Text-only is not accessible" had a couple good points and also some weak points. 
The article didn't make very clear what definition of "web page accessibility" was being used in the article. 
There are at least a couple of definitions. 
One defintion is concerned about the disabled person being able to use a web page. 
Another definition considers whether a disabled person can use a web page with minimal disadvantage in a competitive environment like school or work. 
I agree with the author's comment that "Text-only websites are not suited to all users with impairments." 
However, the author doesn't differentiate about the impact that different disabilities can have on interacting with web pages. 
For example, blindness can fairly strongly impact how a blind person can work with web pages. 
In my case, I am a quadriplegic and my disability generally has much less impact on my using web pages. 
The author refers to "partially sighted" users without clarifying what is meant. 
The term "partially sighted" is somewhat braod. 
A person who is extremely near-sighted may find images distracting while following text. 
Other "partially sighted" people may have have visual fields where their vision is clearer and other areas where it is not. 
With this type of partial sightedness, images and color may be helpful. 
Currently it is not clear what the best ways may be for improving accessibility for people where there might be cognitive concerns. 
For example, providing an accomodation for a person with one type of cognitive challenge may cause problems for a person for a different cognitive concern. 
One person may have cognitive problems processing visual information and may prefer more text which can be read to them. 
Another person may have problems reading text and prefer more images with much less text. 
Perhaps, a better way to approach the accessibility of text pages is to understand that disabilities may be divided into at least a couple of categories. 
One category of disability could be those which could substantially benefit from web pages which are primarily text, Another category of disability is one where those disabilities may not have substantial benefit from a web page which is primarily text. 
An approach could be to take the standard web page and tweak it enough that it has some more support for people with disabilities who won't have significant benefit from web pages which are primarily text. 
A question which needs to be determined is how much tweaking is needed. 
The issue of maintaining multiple versions of a web page is more of a technological issue. 
If web pages are dynamically generated from databases, there is less chance for version skew. 
Or, perhaps web page editors could be written where they can keep different versions of a web page in sync. 
The issue of perception and disabled people is still a matter of perception. 
For example, many blind people do not feel marginalized because they use Braille. 
There are many blind people who strongly advocate for Braille which they see as fairly equivalent to print and of equal value even if it is different than print. 
I believe that a weak point in the author's arguement is that he doesn't use much empircal evidence in his analysis. 
For example, he is suggesting that tables can be used as long as they linearize well. 
However, he doesn't go into detail about how much effort or time is needed to learn what linearization is, to determine if a table will linearize well or to fix linearization problems. 
There doesn't seem to be any references to timing blind users to see how quickly they can navigate web sites as compared to sighted users. 
References to actual failure analyses about mistakes made by people with different disabilities seem to be missing.
