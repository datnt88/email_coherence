There is a mention of DOMBuilder.setFeature in the description for createDOMBuilder (http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030226/load-save#LS-DOMIMplementationLS-createDOMBuilder), though the definition has been removed. 
There also seems to be nothing in the draft that would mandate a parser be namespace-aware. 
Unlike other parser configuration options, it would 
be very difficult to write code that could adapt if some implementations presented namespace-aware DOMBuilders and others didn't. 
There is a parameter for namespaces. 
The description of DOMBuilder.config contains the following: In addition to the boolean parameters and parameters recognized in the Core module, and the Core module has a "namespaces" parameter, which activated by default by the way. 
This parameter is required to be supported, so parsers for DOM Level 3 Load and Save are required to support the namespace processing.

Good catch! 
It'll be removed in the next update.
