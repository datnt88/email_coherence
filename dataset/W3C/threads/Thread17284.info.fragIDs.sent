<s> Hi all - I've been working with MIT's OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu) project for about a year now and since I started, Web accessibility was at the forefront of my mind.  </s>
<s> For those not familiar with the project, Wired recently did a overview that published this week: Anyway, we're about to do a massive republish of all 500 courses (we have about 200 up now) on September 30th - the day of our official launch.  </s>
<s> Prior to that, I'd like to revisit the work I've already done on our site templates to make sure they are accessible as possible.  </s>
<s> Our current site is made up of a series of templates: * Main Site (http://ocw.mit.edu) * Generic Global (such as "About OCW" - * Department (http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/index.htm ) * Course Home Page (http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-00Introduction-to-Computers-and-Engineering-Problem-SolvingSpring2002/CourseHome/index.htm *Second-Level Course Page (http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-00Introduction-to-Computers-and-Engineering-Problem-SolvingSpring2002/Calendar/index.htm)  </s>
<s> With these templates, everything between the main header for the page (in red and designated with a p class="pagetitle" ) and the footer is controlled by the template with the exception of the Course Home Page.  </s>
<s> Known issue: Like many Web developers, I was hit with a graphical spec.  </s>
<s> with which to design the site.  </s>
<s> In sticking to that specification, I had to use static tables for layout rather than dynamic tables or CSS positioning.  </s>
<s> So the only "Error" that should show up in Bobby is an AA - "you are not using percentages instead of pixels for your tables".  </s>
<s> If and when we do a redesign, part of the RFP will be an XHTML + CSS only site.  </s>
<s> Some things I am aware of and am working on: 1. Changing p class="pagetitle" to an actual h1 to make it easier for screenreaders to get to the meat of a document.  </s>
<s> 2. Modifying the stylesheet to use percentages instead of pixels - I need to map the various inheritance schemes to do this. 3. Running Adobe's "Make Accessible" plugin is standard procedure for every PDF though some (like those using Type 3 fonts or that are inordinately complex) get corrupt through this process and are not run through it.  </s>
<s> 4. We've started a campus-wide committee to address PDF accessibility in the form of educating Professors and TAs about how to format source documents (MS Word, TeX) and plan to offer templates.  </s>
<s> 5. An Accessibility Statement.  </s>
<s> Other than that, I've run all our templates through the HTML Validator, the CSS Validator and Bobby (I STILL haven't found a decent accessibility checker aside from reading the WCAG directly).  </s>
<s> A majority of the body text for the Second-Level Course Pages still need work as they were entered by one of 30 different authors and the authoring tool (eWebEditPro - part of our CMS) seems to want to reformat some elements as XHTML.  </s>
<s> My primary concentration is everything controlled by the templates.  </s>
<s> But if I ever have time, I will go back and fix the 500 courses and their 5000 related HTML pages ;)  </s>
<s> Questions I pose to you, the reviewer: 1.  </s>
<s> Should I look into tabindex and accesskey for the common navigation elements throughout the site?  </s>
<s> 2. Should I be grouping all the left-hand navigation links or top navigation links in some way?  </s>
<s> 3. What about letting people know that a certain link will "open up" in a new window, i.e. target="_blank" - should I give these links a special title?  </s>
<s> 4. What am I missing?  </s>
<s> I think that's everything - if you decided to help us out and take a look, please review pages that use at least one of each template.  </s>
<s> Comments, suggestions &amp; criticisms are most welcome and please feel free to forward this onto other mailing lists.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> 1. Yes, look at accesskey but don't worry about tabindex unless you use some weird and complex positioning stuff.  </s>
<s> 2. Yes, you should group blocks of navigation links.  </s>
<s> Until browsers figure out how to do this better (IE is the standout on the very useful link element, and skipping navigation links without a nice structure and a "skip to main content" link are still not mainstream  </s>
<s> unfortunately).  </s>
<s> 3. Yes, let people know.  </s>
<s> Add "pop-up", or "new window" or something to the link text is my preference, but there is an argument to be made that putting this in the title is "informing the user".  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>

<s> Great, thanks.  </s>
<s> I meant in HTML....currently they're all "together" in that they're positioned in the same section.  </s>
<s> Is there anything other than a div that I should be using to designate them as a group?  </s>
<s> Well, if it was done in the title of a link, JAWS will read that title when it becomes active - right?  </s>
<s> That's the only user to whom notification of a new window would be quite important, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> I appreciate you taking the time to at least answer my questions.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Hiya BK well, a div does group the things in it.  </s>
<s> For current implementation there's not much more you can do, beyond adding a "skip" link.  </s>
<s> JAWS users don't represent the users of screen readers.  </s>
<s> People who use screen magnifiers are also likely to find that that they don't see the window changing (because they don't see the whole screen, just the bit they are looking at).  </s>
<s> There also lots of people who get confused by opening new windows.  </s>
<s> This is why I recommend putting the clue into the link text.  </s>
<s> Cheers (and by the way, congratulations to you and all who have worked on getting MITs courses online.  </s>
<s> This is the sort of project that shows the full potential of the Web).  </s>
