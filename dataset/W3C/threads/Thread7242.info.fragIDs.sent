<s> I think you are confused about the use of the word transactions.  </s>
<s> (perhaps our fault).  </s>
<s> We refer to cooerpative transactions, not the kind that is refered to in Gray's book.  </s>
<s> There is a good survey article by Gail Kaiser on the book "Modern Database Systems", ed: Won Kim.  </s>
<s> You can also find the same article on the web at cs.columbia.edu.  </s>
<s> I don't know what all the fuss is about?  </s>
<s> The functionality being requested can still be provided without us having to worry about transaction processing.  </s>
<s> Transaction processing is an implementation detail and not an on the wire issue.  </s>
<s> We have the same issues with collection copy if there is a failure for some reason.  </s>
<s> Let's be pragmatic and come-up with a solution which will allow for the locking (copying, moving deleting) of multiple resources with a respone body (XML) which will allow the server to indicate to the client which resources (if any) failed to be locked (copied, deleted, moved ...) and allow the client (respectively the user) to deal with the problem.  </s>
<s> All that the server has to guarantee in the case of locks is that a lock on multiple resources (whether there was partial failure or not) can be repeated (to attempt lock those resources which failed the first time) and that the granted group lock can be removed without failing if it only partially succeeded.  </s>
<s> The resolution of conflicts can be solved by the users in out of band communication.  </s>
<s> The response body should provide enough information for the user to be able to determine with whom to undertake the out of band communication (I believe someone has already made this point).  </s>
