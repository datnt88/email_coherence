attached page (managment frameset from Zope generates the following errors: line 4 column 1 - Warning: script lacks "type" attribute line 19 column 1 - Warning: inserting implicit body line 20 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected /noframes line 23 column 2 - Warning: missing /noframes the last two seem to be contradicting. 
And I'm not sure that placing noframes inside frameset ... is correct ? 
Hannu Does anyone know where tidy write its output to a file. 
I have looked at localize.c 
lexer.c 
tidy.c and clean1.c 
I'm looking for the actual print calls.

Generally, some of it is in localize.c 
- tidy_out(), and some of it is in pprint.c - putc() calls. 
Typically "tidy" is writing to "stdout" or "stderr", and depending on your implementation and use of "tidy", redirection of stdout/stderr to a file may be automatic (e.g. -f tidied.errs), or you may have to invoke I/O redirection for your OS. e.g. tidy -f tidied.errs 
tidied.html  
tidied.out. 
If you have specific questions on the Mac OS versions regarding redirection of I/O, let me know. 
Hope this helps. 
I'm sure others will correct me if I am wrong.

A premature endtag can be unexpected, and then turn up missing where it should have been. 
No, it is correct. 
In a frameset document, NOFRAMES is legal inside FRAMESET and contains BODY. 
Otherwise, NOFRAMES is seen as BODY content and implies BODY, which is illegal for a frameset document. 
NOFRAMES should be in the outermost FRAMESET of the frameset document, preferably just before closure of that frameset, making the last four endtags of the document be the sequence /BODY /NOFRAMES /FRAMESET /HTML ". ,= #)-=# http://www.war-of-the-worlds.org/
