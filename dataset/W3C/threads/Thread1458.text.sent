Hi, Here are two slides representing Version Controlled Collections in powerpoint... 
Is my understanding of VCCs (as shown in these slides) correct? 
Is this useful stuff to put on www.webdav.org/deltav?

Peter, I found this quite helpful. 
Greg, how could we host this on webdav.org/deltav? 
Just save as HTML and provide a link off an notes page?

#### Version Controlled Collections.ppt has been removed from this note on September 14 2001 by Jim Amsden Looks fine to me. 
Do you have a web site you could post this on, that I could link to from the deltav site? 
That was how most of the document references are currently handled. 
Otherwise, we could also just put the source of these slides directly on the deltav site.

I found this confusing since it implies/states that the collection version has bindings to the version history resources, whereas in practice a collection version has no bindings (but it does have a property that 'captures' the version-controlled bindings of a version-controlled collection.)
