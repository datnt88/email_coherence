<s> IOW if any node is clicked it will try to display itself somehow.  </s>
<s> For the #PCDATA it would bring up a window with the story in.  </s>
<s> The default display of X will be a tree unless otherwise determined by X.class or a stylesheet (not yet implemented).  </s>
<s> Since the elements below are all links they will have non-default behaviours as follows:  </s>
<s> X L ROLE="EG" LABEL="English translation" SHOW="NEW" HREF="/cgi-bin/xlate?term=tesuji" /  </s>
<s> Clicking on EG will try to create a new XML tree out of the TEI pointer and display it in a new window.  </s>
<s> The return value of the cgi-script is not defined and is presumably an XML Element in some (unknown?) DTD.  </s>
<s> For example, I have developed the Virtual HyperGlossary technology using XML and it would be quite reasonable to use VHG as a resource to answer *this* query.  </s>
<s> I think that addressing into other resources is something that is poorly defined at present and will need addressing.  </s>
<s> Since in the above example ?term= is not defined in XML, you take your chances on what comes back.  </s>
<s> JUMBO deals with this if it can understand the MIME types in a table and if it has DTDs which cover those applications.  </s>

<s> Here the syntax is not the same as in my spec.  </s>
<s> (I imagine the first is a typo).  </s>
<s> The second could read either: (ALL,FIG,CAPTION,TESUJI) or (1,FIG,CAPTION,TESUJI) The first will probably throw JUMBO because if there are 50 pictures of tesuji it won't know how to mamage them.  </s>
<s> The second will be placed in a special JUMBOTOC area where things are EMBEDded.  </s>
<s> At present each new EMBED overrides the last one, but this is mainly a tearful matter of hacking the awful Java AWT.  </s>
<s> A hypercard system would be simple-ish to implement.  </s>
<s> A click on PIC will retrieve a FIG element (or null) from pix.xml and will try to display it in the EMBED space.  </s>

<s> This is why I keep hammering on about defining the TYPE of the thing that comes back from a search :-)  </s>

<s> JUMBO does not implement '..' for reasons previously noted.  </s>
<s> If it *did*, it wouldn't know that the resultant element*S* were to be displayed as text and you would get a tree of little bits of #PCDATA and markup.  </s>
<s> This is a limitation of JUMBO, which is not a text-oriented tool, but it highlights the need to have an *automatic* switch between tree and stream modes of rendering.  </s>
<s> L ROLE="ToMove" LABEL="Jump to move in game record" SHOW="REPLACE" HREF="game.xml#Move127" / tesuji /X .  </s>
<s> On clicking, JUMBO would replace the *whole of the TOC* by the object defined at Move127.  </s>
<s> If that were an unknown GI it would default to a tree-based representation.  </s>
<s> If there were (say) a MOVE.class written in java, then the string: HREF="game.xml#Move127(1,MOVE)" would call the MOVE.display(Graphics g) routine and paint the whole of the screen space (previously occupied by TEST) with whatever picture of Moves were possible.  </s>
<s> In essence my use of the MOVE in the query is my own trick for imposing strong typing - and I think it could be usefully considered in XML-LINK.  </s>
<s> Note that to 'go back' requires either keeping a history list or putting XML-link REPLACE in the new object linking back to where you came from :-).  </s>
<s> For this reason, I don't normally replace the TOC although I started to demo this at SGML97 before it crashed.  </s>

<s> In other words, should it be highlighted and able to launch traversal on a click?  </s>
<s> In JUMBO it already does exactly this.  </s>
<s> (It has an icon rather than being highlighted because it's in a tree).  </s>

<s> current spec, it's not unless I have another locator that says L ROLE="whatever" Label="whatever" HREF="#HERE,"/  </s>
<s> JUMBO has no need of this in my interpretation.  </s>
<s> What we need to do, I think, is to say either that: (1) another locator as described above is required, or (2) any content of extended linking elements that is not a locator element is to be treated as a resource.  </s>
<s> I don't undertstand this fully.  </s>
<s> Leaving aside subadressing, the target of a locator is either: - a non-XML document (e.g. *.txt, *.html).  </s>
<s> XML is not required to do anything with these, but JUMBO interprets some common MIME types and does its best.  </s>
<s> (*.txt, *.html, *.mol, etc.) - an XML document in a different DTD.  </s>
<s> I don't know what others do but JUMBO will try to get the DTD and parse the new document in its own namespace and display it.  </s>
<s> (This is why namespaces are so critical).  </s>
<s> As you can appreciate this is really hairy at present.  </s>
<s> - a WF fragment of an XML document in the current DTD.  </s>
<s> This should be displayed/processed etc. according to (a) whether it is an XML-LINK or (b) whether it isn't.  </s>
<s> The last two seem to be the only things we can discuss at present.  </s>
<s> If the target is NOT an XML-LINK, then it is treated as if it were any other Element in the document (perhaps with flags to say it came from outerspace).  </s>
<s> If it *is* an XML-LINK, then I interpret the rules as follows: If it does not contain AUTO, then it is displayed as if it were part of the current document.  </s>
<s> This might be a tree, a stream, a map, an audio clip or whatever.  </s>
<s> If it does contain AUTO (or if the user has clicked it) then it is immediately processed and is never displayed.  </s>
<s> JUMBO already does this.  </s>
<s> Here is my example which some of you will have seen working (rather tweaked) An assignment is an experimental observation linking a molecule to a peak in a spectrum (say).  </s>
<s> When the TOC is drawn, the XLIST is displayed with its children (ASSIGNMENTs).  </s>
<s> These do nothing until clicked.  </s>
<s> When "Assignment 1" is clicked it locates #ass1 which happens to be an ASSIGNMENT.  </s>
<s> This has ACTUATE="AUTO", which is also inherited by its children (right?).  </s>
<s> So the ASSIGNMENT bursts into life and starts to process its children.  </s>
<s> *These* are AUTO XML-LINKs as well and therefore locate their targets which they then have to display.  </s>
<s> The result of this is that: - the original TOC is unaltered (SHOW="NEW") - the ASSIGNMENT is not rendered (or maybe in a NEW window) - the targets of the assignment are (separately) rendered in NEW windows.  </s>
<s> What would happen if the XVAR had SHOW="REPLACE"?  </s>
<s> I think that the ASSIGNMENT would create its tree in memory, then display its children in new windows and then replace the TOC display with its own 'display' Since that 'display' was to launch its own children, I suspect the result would either be the naked tree, or would be a blank-ish window.  </s>
<s> But I suspect that that is application-dependent.  </s>
<s> Note that processing can take place *even if there is no display screen*.  </s>
<s> All JUMBO elements have a routine process() and display(), and so a hierarchical structure would be traversed in a determinate order and every node would ultimately be processed.  </s>
<s> I hope this makes sense and is a reasonable interpretation of the spec.  </s>
<s> If anyone wants to use JUMBO to try this out on I'd be happy to oblige.  </s>
<s> I *think* the version at: features implemented, but if not I'll need to get a new version this week anyway.  </s>
<s> Note that JUMBO is not very good at embedding words in text, yet.  </s>
<s> In any case it only honours the HTML dtd.  </s>

<s> (1) amounts to leaving the current spec unchanged; a legal form of the example might be: !DOCTYPE test [ ] Faced with a tight situation, Sakata found a s id='T' tesuji /s .  </s>

<s> It does, however, have one advantage over Tim's proposal (2) (and over the XML-link SIMPLE form): it provides an obvious and clear place for the role, label, and behavior information which section 3.1 is associated with each resource of each link.  </s>
<s> (Our SIMPLE form, unlike the HTML A, doesn't provide role information for the resource enclosed within it; it should.)  </s>
<s> When this first came up I thought about changing EXTENDED to allow content of (#PCDATA | LOCATOR | SIMPLE)* -- since SIMPLE does have the meaning of asserting a link, one of whose link ends is enclosed.  </s>
<s> But since SIMPLE doesn't have provision for the role and label information, I no longer think that's a good idea -- and SIMPLE is also documented as applying to two-ended links, which makes no sense in the middle of an EXTENDED element.  </s>
<s> So: yes, if people think this example makes sense, then XML-link should lose the arbitrary restrictions that mean only two-way links can have, by definition, one of their resources as their own location.  </s>
<s> But now we need two forms of EXTENDED link, one whose location and content have meaning, and one whose location is (as in the current spec) guaranteed not significant.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should define !ATTLIST resource XML-link CDATA #FIXED "resource" role CDATA #IMPLIED title CDATA #IMPLIED then we can say and say the location and contents of an EXTENDED link are a resource if and only if it contains a RESOURCE element.  </s>
<s> And then the resource will have the appropriate attributes.  </s>
<s> We should NOT simply say 'if there is content, then that content is a resource', because even if there is no content, the EXTENDED element has a location -- and the whole point is whether the location of the EXTENDED element is significant or not.  </s>
<s> We do not want white-space variation to make EXTENDED pointers acquire and lose resources every time the document is parsed by a different processor.  </s>
<s> We SHOULD fix the problem in SIMPLE links.  </s>
