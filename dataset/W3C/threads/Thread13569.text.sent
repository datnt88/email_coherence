Hi I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm looking for sample Earl data to try and implement an Annotea-like service for the SWAD-Europe project[1]. 
Could anyone point me at data? 
thanks Libby [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/ Oh dear, I was hoping someone else would reply ... AFAIK the test corpus remains a wishlist-item, and what exists are tools to generate and work with EARL, such as Nadia's, Jim's and mine. 
There are now four Valet tools that generate EARL: three online and one for the desktop. 
In addition, some of Jim's tools work as clients to Page Valet (the first Valet tool to product EARL). 
Have you looked at them? 
Especially the Accessibility Valet (see my recent post "EARL as you've never seen it")? 
Nick Kew Eric set up a database for us. 
Refer to the chat logs from 1 August: Not sure how much data is in there yet...could you reuse this service for what you want to do?

I'm thinking at the moment I'll start with Hixie's sample data from css and see how I go. 
I like what Jim's been doing with snork and alttextrobot and I might have a hack at those. 
Insofar as you and SWAD-Europe is concerned I guess the MIT installationn is the main one - I'll try to leech off that :) Libby
