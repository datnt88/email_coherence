<s> Hi, After typing (inserting) text at the beginning of existing text, the tree debug dump via TtaListAbstractTree does not appear to have these characters.  </s>
<s> However all views render the inserted text properly.  </s>
<s> This does not occur when text is inserted in the middle or end of existing text.  </s>
<s> 1. Is there a call to synchronize the debug dump tree?  </s>
<s> (probably commit the  </s>
<s> insert?!) 2. Is it strange that the views have the updates while the internal tree doesn't?!  </s>
<s> Thanks for any help!  </s>

<s> Irene, I traced through the code and the debug code does go through the menu code which automatically calls CloseTextInsertion(). We're working off of a modified source base so I put that line in.  </s>

<s> When I copy a link from the bookmark document and paste it in the doc I loose the link.  </s>

<s> And I have about 150 link to copy and paste.  </s>

<s> Yes, we have.  </s>
<s> I guess you are selecting the link by dragging it with the mouse.  </s>
<s> So, you just select a character string: look at the status line, at the bottom of the window.  </s>
<s> It probably says "Text\...".  </s>
<s> Actually, what you want to copy is not that text, but the anchor element that contains that text.  </s>
<s> Travel the structure a bit up, until the anchor element (A) is selected.  </s>
<s> Use the F2 key (Windows) or the Esc key (Unix) to that purpose.  </s>
<s> The status line or the structure view help you to make sure you select an A element.  </s>
<s> Then copy and paste.  </s>
<s> It's quite fast: you don't need to drag over the whole text.  </s>
<s> Click anywhere within the anchor and hit F2 or Esc.  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> Depending on the structure of your bookmark.html  </s>
<s> document you may even handle everything at once, by selecting the right part of the source document.  </s>
