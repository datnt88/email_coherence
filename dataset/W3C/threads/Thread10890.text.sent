I think we all agree that enriched hyperlink semantics are A Good Thing... the question is, what are the trade-offs? 
It is a basic requirement that anything we put into this be (a) tractable to implement and (b) easy to explain. 
It's not clear to me that a solution based on groves/grove-plans, or a query language, meets this requirement. 
It's also not clear that it doesn't, but this is a challenge that must be answered. 
One of the reasons that it must be answered is that a minimum solution, essentially just making a formalism for multi-way typed hyperlinks, is dramatically more than what the Web guys have, and can be put *instantly* to good use. 
Thus if we do a good job on that, we have a good chance of buying enough credibility to get some support to take us further down the path. 
On the other hand, if we produce something that is even one-tenth as difficult to understand as, for example, the current HyTime standard, and does not lend itself to instant implementations, nobody will notice or care. 
Hell, I want general transclusion a la Xanadu... Already, I think we've learned another chunk of Minimum Progress Required to Declare Victory: 5. Minimum Progress on Extensibility The chosen mechanisms should have the property that they not impede progress toward the addition of advanced hypermedia mechanisms up to and past general transclusion. 
Cheers, T. which is another linking behaviour that the Web already has, perhaps unfortunately. 
For years now (that's eons in Web time) I've been complaining that involuntary transclusion works against the interests of copyright holders and dramatically reduces their desire to make copyrighted material available inthe Web environment. 
IMG was bad enough (from this angle); FRAMEs are dreadful (from this angle). 
I don't see any simple solution, and maybe linking is not the arena in which a solution should be sought. 
But if this group can find a way to construct links such that the server of the transcluded object can detect that it's being fetched for the purpose of transclusion, that would be an immense win. 
Awesome, even. 
Xanadu evades this matter by assuming that everyone has already signed on to a copyright protection and micropayment scheme. 
The real world is, of course, different.

"In going on with these experiments, how many pretty systems do we build, which we soon find outselves obliged to destroy?" - Benjamin Franklin A Davenport Group Sponsor: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html Please bear with me to the end of this harangue, because it's relevant to several topics. 
I think Terry's remark highlights a key issue. 
A embryonic general solution to Terry's question, "Activity Policy Association," exists in HyTime. 
The fundamental idea is simple enough: you have a statement of the owner's policy -- a license statement -- which is unambiguously attached to the information. 
(In HyTime, the statement could be, in fact, an applet which enforces the policy, but I'm not proposing that XML endorse that refinement.) The licensed information serves as an anchor of what, in effect, is a special kind of link to an object that expresses the policy. 
And here is where we see a more fundamental issue that is relevant to the whole discussion of hyperlinking in XML. 
The question is: "Does an anchor know that it is an anchor?" 
The answers to lots of important questions depend on the answer to the above question, including: "Can an n-ended link be n-directional?" ( n  = 2, of course ) "Can a link appear elsewhere than any of its anchors?" 
"Can metadata (such as activity policies) be associated and re-associated with data without changing the data?" 
This question should not be easy for any voting member of the ERB to decide. 
Frankly, I don't know how I would vote; at this point I'd have to wait and see what came out of the discussion. 
On the one hand, if we say that anchors must be aware of their anchorishness even when the links that confer anchor status upon them are elsewhere, a many-headed Hydra monster arises. 
HyTime and the HyTime TC1, and DSSSL (especially with its grove notion) offer some cool answers for dealing with that monster that really work. 
But these concepts are hard to explain and hard to understand, and they scare implementers who haven't lived with the underlying ideas for awhile. 
For most people, they're extremely challenging ideas, frankly: as challenging as the object-oriented paradigm (which is mainly what it *is*, in fact). 
Even so, having lived intimately with the problem and discussion of anchor awareness and its implementation for years, I have this not-so-clever insight to share: Either we accept a basic paradigm change in the way we handle and think about pretty much every component of documents (i.e., we move to the grove paradigm), or we can't really implement anchor awareness. 
Sobering, isn't it? 
On the other hand, if (as in HTML) we say that all linking is unidirectional and all links have two ends, the starting end of which is where the link is, XML does not offer any functional improvement, in hyper terms, over HTML. 
That's OK, and we won't have to go on a Hydra-slaying mission, but I think there's a huge problem with this alternative, too. 
Will people switch from HTML to XML just because they get the totally intangible and abstract benefit of arbitrary structure and generic markup? 
I think, in most cases, not. 
It won't matter that XML is better for the long term if there's no compelling reason to switch over to it. 
A radical improvement in hyperfunctionality would, I think, certainly provide a compelling reason and turn the tide. 
I'm not sure what else, if anything, could do that as powerfully or certainly. 
God bless us, every one.

Rochester, NY 14692-3795 USA It seems obvious from Steve &amp; Eliot's remarks that we might as well adopt the Hytime nomenclature and define "anchor" to be something that is actually participating in a link relationship. 
It's easy to explain and understand, and is totally unambiguous; definitely in the XML style. 
(And web-head friendly; an HTML anchor *is* in fact an anchor when it's being used; the fact that it's not when it's not doesn't really muddy the waters). 
I'd feel happier documenting or teaching this if there was a phrase in there to explain that "anchor" in XML is no longer restricted to the old HTML sense of "jumping-off-point". 
Many millions of users have been taught (or have assimilated) that an anchor is a location you can return to using the BACK button (and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else because it's a quick and easy way to get the unidirectional dea across). 
Probe 1: fine. 
Probe 2: 2. the benefits of self-awareness depend on an ability to state with confidence that all anchors are self-aware Is this a binary choice, or do we have some growing list of benefits as the number of self-aware anchors grows (n -- N) ? 
Probe 3: fine. 
Probe 4: 1. Enforcing anchor-awareness is not done in terms of syntax, but in terms of allowed behavior during link traversal, so 2. The spec we're about to write would need to specify, not just a language, but processor behavior, just as the XML spec does. 
If this means binding a set of behaviours to (say) a specific set of element-and-attribute combos by prescription in the spec, then I don't see a problem. 
If it means "may" and "might" and "could" then I'm less happy about it, as we would make it easier to lose Probe 2.2 above. 
I think we need to be very explicit about the benefits that are achievable. 
If we can't spell them out in the spec (that may not be the right place for them) then we should have an Implementor's Notes document which does. 
IPR: They can be solved at the technical level but require high-level enforcement (ie obeyable legislation). 
(b) this semantic [publish and let anyone point to it anonymously] is something that is actively desired by many people. 
I think that on the current Web "many" == "most". 
If there is a danger that people will equate XML with "you can't just point at anything any more" then there is a risk it will be ignored. 
Terry's arguments have convinced me that we do after all need to cover the IPR topic in the spec, but I don't know to what depth.
