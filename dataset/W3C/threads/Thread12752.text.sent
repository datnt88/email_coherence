QuickTips #8: The argument that only priority 1 items can be on the card is already broken since "title" attribute is only ever given as an example and "name" not at all in the checkpoints, therefore "noframe" is just as permissible. 
Proposal: Frames. 
Use "noframe"[format shows it as an element]. 
Use _title_ or _name_ attribute.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Slight change: Frames: use _noframes_, and meaningful _title_ or _name_ attribute. 
(I would drop attribute to fit the line) Actually, "alt" is also only an example...

If it is bold lower-case then the word "attribute" is a *DUH* item. 
Else why not use the word "element"?

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Pretty good! 
This might be clearer as two sentences if they can fit: Frames: Use _noframes_. 
Choose meaningful _title_ or _name_ attribute.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE agree. 
drop attribute. 
If we are going to use "smallcap" bold for elements and lowercase bold for attributes, then using "attribute" is redundant and wastes space for more important material that is "written clearly" Jim Behalf Of William Loughborough Unless the decision to continue using the word "attribute" is required by Tim or some stone-engraved rule, I think it should be dropped in all three places it's used (1,6, and 8) in favor of denoting that the term in question is an attribute by its typography, as is currently done with "element".
