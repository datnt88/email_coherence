<s> Whilst exploring a web site recently with lynx 2.7.1AC-0.34,  </s>
<s> I noticed that there was no intervening space between the ALT texts associated with certain images and the words immediately following them.  </s>
<s> Thus, the speech synthesiser read the ALT text and the subsequent word as though they comprised a single word.  </s>
<s> The markup responsible for this problem can be exemplified as follows:  </s>
<s> The displayed output was: arrowHome page Leaving aside the question of whether ALT text should be associated with a graphical list bullet, as was the case for the site in question, I wish to know whether the absence of a space following the ALT text is a peculiarity of the lynx browser or a more general problem.  </s>
<s> If it is the latter, then perhaps the guidelines could make it clear that a space must appear in the markup after the IMG element.  </s>
<s> If, however, this problem is specific to lynx, then the guidelines should not be changed, but instead the developers should be sent a bug report.  </s>
<s> DD: I think this is a Browser guidelines issue, eventually a bug in Lynx.  </s>
<s> Are graphical browsers having this problem?  </s>
<s> There is an implicit white space between the image box containing the ALT text and surrounding text.  </s>
<s> I see this as a problem specific to LYNX, since it text based and runs characters right up against each other.  </s>
<s> Some important content produces have asked Microsoft to remove the display of ALT text while a page loads, saying that it clutters the visual presentation of the screen.  </s>
<s> They argue that the ALT text should only be shown if the loading of images is turned off.  </s>
<s> So far we have resisted doing this.  </s>
<s> Instead, sites stop putting ALT text on images, saying that small images with long ALT text makes for a cluttered screen with sentence fragments all over while the page loads.  </s>
<s> So they just don't use ALT text.  </s>
<s> This is bad.  </s>
<s> Microsoft Active Accessibility removes the need to actually have the screen reader interpret the screen, so a screen reader will always know when it is verbalizing a image ALT string and when it's just speaking regular text and can put any sort of verbal delimiters around the speaking of the ALT text.  </s>
<s> I'd appreciate it if someone can confirm that this is a problem with a graphical web browser.  </s>

<s> DD: I think this is a Browser guidelines issue, eventually a bug in Lynx.  </s>
<s> Section 9.1 of the HTML 4.0 specification is also relevant here, in as much as it states that authors can not rely on user agents to render space immediately following a start tag.  </s>
<s> Thus, even if guidelines recommended insertion of a space after the IMG element, it might not be rendered by some user agents.  </s>
<s> I think this issue should be sent (1) to the lynx developers; and (2) to the UI guidelines working group.  </s>
<s> I would also like to know whether any other user agents, for example the text-based browser used under Emacs, have the same problem.  </s>
<s> If so, then their developers should be alerted.  </s>
<s> I should follow this up and say why I mentioned the ALT text/visual clutter issue in the first place.  </s>
<s> It's been suggested that browsers add delimiters around ALT text in a graphical browser.  </s>
<s> Some people have suggested using square brackets ("[]").  </s>
<s> Daniel below says that this is a browser guideline issue.  </s>
<s> Recommending that the browsers automatically add it in the visual display would give content producers even more reason to not add ALT text to their images.  </s>
<s> Sorry I wasn't clear in my first message.  </s>

<s> DD: I think this is a Browser guidelines issue, eventually a bug in Lynx.  </s>
<s> I tried creating an HTML document of my own that would reproduce the problem, but with no success.  </s>
<s> A page with respect to which the problem occurs is at http://www.vicnet.net.au/websites/  </s>
<s> Perhaps those who have access to several different browsers could investigate and report their findings.  </s>
<s> I still think this will turn out to be a user interface issue, probably specific to lynx, in which case it does not belong in the markup guidelines.  </s>
<s> It's a really a presentation issue, best dealt with CSS and/or browser presentation setting.  </s>
<s> Logically, my markup is: IMG src=foo alt=foo Text In my page author CSS, I can add a margin between the foo image and Text.  </s>
<s> Lynx, since it doesn't understand CSS, should offer a way for the user to speficy a custom margin (e.g. a space).  </s>
<s> So I'm not recommanding that browser automatically add it.  </s>
<s> When I used LYNX v2.6 I got the following: ArrowCommunity Groups ArrowUser's Homepages ArrowCommercial Web Sites ArrowVirtual Domains ArrowStorage Space ArrowOn-line Databases ArrowSearching Your Site The word "Arrow" was lined right up against the link text "Community Groups" in the first example.  </s>
<s> The HTML source was: a href="#community" img width=13 height=8 src="/vicnet/arrow.gif"  </s>
<s> border=0 alt="Arrow" b Community /b Groups /a br On my own web site, http://nwlink.com/~chuckop/  </s>
<s> I have this HTML: h1 img src="3dnew.gif"  </s>
<s> width="68" height="68" alt="What's New Logo" align="middle" What's New /h1 LYNX displays this as: What's New Logo What's New Note the space between the ALT text and regular text.  </s>
<s> Maybe this has something to do with the b tag in the first example?  </s>
