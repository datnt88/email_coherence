<s> Standard actions such as Help (how very apt), Print, Pay Now, Email,... up to about 20 or so that could be used for wider-access but also including multicultural aspects.  </s>
<s> General questions though, would a set of symbols like this be useful ?  </s>
<s> Can a set be established that really mean the same thing to a wide range of users?  </s>
<s> Like a STOP sign, is this international and/or recognized by all?  </s>
<s> All feedback, excluding flames, most welcome.  </s>

<s> There are some symbols which are pretty common - stop signs, for example.  </s>
<s> I think a question mark is widely recognised for help, and an envelope reasonably widely for email.  </s>
<s> (All this assumes sighted users, of course).  </s>
<s> There are other syumbols which are common, but mean different things - magnifying glasses, wavy lines, dollar signs, credit card logos, and various other icons are ubiquititous, but are understood differently according to context and personal background.  </s>
<s> So they may not be as helpful as they could.  </s>

<s> In replay to James Merrill and others concerning  </s>
<s> It would seem that written language used in any electronic or print material would specifically require that symbols commonly accepted for the specific language would be the best choice.  </s>
<s> The possibilities of having a misunderstanding is greatly reduced when the designer's native language is the same as the target audience.  </s>
<s> Major problems develop when instructions are translated from a foreign language into English.  </s>
<s> Ask any father who attempts to assemble a bicycle on the evening before Christmas and the product was manufactured in China.  </s>
<s> To determine if there is any universal acceptance, someone must first collect and publish symbols used as part of English documents and see if there are any differences that might occur in American, Australia, and England.  </s>
<s> Other individuals who publish materials in other languages would be needed to provide provide the symbols they use.  </s>
<s> Complete universality may be impractical, but perhaps translator of a short list of symbols could be developed.  </s>
<s> For example, a web site that has a selection on the main page that allows the visitor to select English, French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, etc. would use the most appropriate symbols as part of their translation of the document.  </s>
<s> I have no previous experience with the specific problem, but it provides an interesting question that should be addressed.  </s>

<s> Hi all, There's a great opportunity to let Netscape know that you want want their 5.0 browser to be W3C compliant- The Web Standards Project, an international coalition of leading Web developers and Web experts, today launched a public campaign to encourage Netscape to make sure its next version of Navigator includes software that would reportedly make the browser 100 percent compliant with two major Web standards.  </s>
<s> WSP is gathering signatures from Web developers and the Web-using public, via its site http://www.webstandards.org , urging Netscape to include its NGLayout engine, which is currently under development, in Navigator 5.0.  </s>
<s> The layout engine takes HTML and other code describing a Web page's appearance and converts it into what the user actually sees.  </s>
<s> Currently, layout engines in both Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer fail to fully support standards created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards bodies.  </s>
<s> The resulting incompatibilities among various browsers add at least 25 percent to the cost of building sites and threaten to fragment the Web.  </s>
<s> Netscape officials have pledged NGLayout will fully support the standards for Document Object Model (DOM) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) level 1 and also support features of the CSS level 2 standard.  </s>
<s> WSP has been urging browser makers to fully support these core standards - as well as others, such as XML - developed by the W3C and other standards bodies.  </s>
<s> CSS gives control over the appearance of many pages at once, from the typography to the behavior of links, as well as precise control over page layout.  </s>
<s> DOM lets developers use scripting languages, such as ECMAScript (n?e JavaScript), to manipulate text, images and other parts of Web pages; for instance, dynamically changing their appearance over time, or moving them around inside the browser window.  </s>
<s> However, Netscape officials have said that current plans won't include NGLayout in Navigator 5.0, scheduled for release later this year.  </s>
<s> The "I Want My NGLayout!" campaign is intended to let Netscape know that Web developers and the Web-using public believe full support for these standards by browsers is crucial for the evolution of the Web.  </s>
<s> If you're interested as a Web developer, please check out the WSP Web site and fill out the form letting Netscape know.  </s>

<s> The field of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC or "Aug.  </s>
<s> Com.") is a well developed specialty, primarily within the purview of Speech Language Pathologists (SLP).  </s>
<s> One very critical topic in this field is the selection of wordless picture systems for non-vocal persons.  </s>
<s> These symbol systems have a tendency towards internationalism because they are designed for young children who have not yet learned to read.  </s>
<s> As odd as the idea may seem, there are several companies which derive a large portion of their incomes selling communication icons!  </s>
<s> Probably the most popular is the Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) of which there are over three thousand (color and black and white): Mayer Johnson - About the PCS (http://www.mayer-johnson.com/PICTSYMB/Aboutpcs.htm), follow the links for BoardMaker to see the color samples.  </s>
<s> Feel free to give these people grief for not having alt text!  </s>
<s> To be fair, I should mention their biggest competitor.  </s>
<s> Prentke Romich has the longest history of a commercial vendor with regard to electronic communication aids.  </s>
<s> They favor a smaller symbol set (less than 200, all in color) and, while interesting, is probably not relevant to this thread: Minspeak FAQ (http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/scs/faq.html).  </s>
<s> This thread seems to betaking a direction towards wordless international communication.  </s>
<s> Persons interested in this should learn about Blissymbolics, a communication system originally Developed by Charles K. Bliss (1897-1985) for the purpose of international communication (think "League of Nations" and you will have an idea of how successful he was).  </s>
<s> Bliss has fewer than one hundred primitives that can be combined into thousands of words.  </s>
