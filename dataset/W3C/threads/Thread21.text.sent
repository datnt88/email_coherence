Dave, Thanks for your efforts on tidy. 
I picked it up via freshmeat this morning and have been busy 'spring cleaning' ever since. 
I've got hardly anything done but at least I know that it's neat!! 
I now feel duty-bound to add alt attributes to all images, give all tables a summary and test using Lynx - good for you. 
I've only picked up on one thing (that I initially thought was down to me): table can apparently use the attribute 'border' without specifying a number in which case it just defaults to a 1-pixel border. 
Clearly one of the WYSIWYG editors I've used in the past (I hate to mention it but possibly M$ Frontpage) has done just that. 
The output from Tidy is a table attribute as follows: border=BORDERwhich, of course renders no border at all. 
Keep up the good work, Nigel Actually, I was agreeing with you. 
TABLE BORDER should be legal. 
If Tidy wants to convert it, it should go to the implied form, not to TABLE BORDER="border" (which is an invalid value), or perhaps to TABLE BORDER="1" (which is I believe the implicit value). 
cheers, ~stuart Stuart, Thanks ... looks like a browser issue then. 
I'm sorry to have bugged you with a spurious problem not of your making. 
Regards, Nigel Nigel Wadsworth - Applications Manager Legend Internet According to the HTML 4.01 spec, it appears that TABLE BORDER is legal HTML. 
See the bottom of section 11.3.1 at URL: example. 
This code implies TABLE FRAME="border" RULES="all" .

Keep up the good work, Nigel I have changed the code to leave border alone for html and to change it to border="1" if you are converting to XHTML. 
The new version will be available in April.
