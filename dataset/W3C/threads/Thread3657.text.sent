Thanks Coralie. 
We could do with a PC-to-wall projector for our meeting, please. 
Is that possible? 
RI Hello Richard Your group will be in room 135 on Monday. 
I've updated the table of groups meeting [1]. 
Your folks may formally register [2] until Feb. 20 2004. 
In case your goup need the info, there's an Overview page [3] and registration to the hotel must be made via a form [4]. 
You'll have two coffee breaks for the day and lunch. 
Will you need some equipment beside wireless network? 
Dom is currently preparing a list of e-mail addresses of the people already registered so that I let them know of your group meeting. 
Thanks in advance Coralie [1] http://www.w3.org/2003/10/tp4groups.htm [2] http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35125/tp2004/ [3] http://www.w3.org/2003/08/allgroupoverview.html [4] http://www.w3.org/2003/08/TP2004-hotelform.html 
Hi Coralie, I spoke with the troops last night, and we would like to have a room for Monday (only) please. 
We're expecting around 6 GEO folks. 
Thanks !

Hello Richard I've taken good note that the I18N GEO TF (Internationalization Working Group, GEO (Guidelines, Education &amp; Outreach) Task Force) would like to meet ; that expected attendance is 6 to 8 and that your group accept observers. 
We have 13 groups meeting on Monday and 14 meeting on Tuesday. 
There is a room available on Monday, Chambre-bureau 1 (don't know the number yet) that can accomodate up to 12 people. 
I offer that your group meet on Monday or on Sunday-Monday if you need two days. 
There is also the possibility that the group meets on Monday+Thursday or Monday+Friday (but that might not be convenient, I agree.) I expect your formal decision next Thursday. 
Then I'll edit the tp2004 registration questionnaire with "I18N GEO" and e-mail will be sent to the people who already registered so that they are aware.

Hi Coralie, It turns out, contrary to previous expectations, that we are expecting quite a good turnout from the i18n GEO group at the tech plen. 
So I was wondering whether there is a spare room available for the Monday/Tuesday that we could use if we decide to hold a meeting?
