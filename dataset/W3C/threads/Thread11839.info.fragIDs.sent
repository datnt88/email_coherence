<s> I think that part of the configurability for 6.3 is in fact an issue of user interface accessibility.  </s>
<s> It is important, if not essential, that the alerting be configurable by the user as part of the general requirement for configurability of the user interface.  </s>
<s> I would support a change to making the nature and timing of alerts a P3 requirement (or two) or of moving them to techniques.  </s>
<s> I would like to note the relationshipto user interface accessibility with a cross reference, and since I think it is more important from an interface perspective than an authroing perspective I am inclined towards making it a technique, which will mean the cross reference is less confussing in terms of suggesting a possible conflict in priority level.  </s>

<s> i promised twice today to think twice before i posted after one a.m., but, after thinking twice about it, it occurred to me that the only reason checkpoint 6.6 is a P3 is that table navigation is a P1 requirement for a dependent user agent, so i suppose you would not be placing an undue burden on a blind author to require him or her to ALT-TAB (or spawn a new shell) to run a dependent user agent in order to hear (and/or feel) if his labor has born fruit or been in vain... i just hope that he or she is using a triple-A authoring tool, that produces quote content that conforms to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines unquote... gregory.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregory.  </s>
<s> One of the nice things about inheriting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in the way we do is that it means that it is, for example, a P2 requirement that tables make sense when linearised.  </s>
<s> Our guidelines rely on the Web Content Guidelines to have correctly prioritised their requirements.  </s>
<s> This is not a bad thing - otherwise we would all end up spending our time doing other people's work.  </s>
<s> I do take your point, but I think that transformations, as provided by 6.6 wouldn't really solve the problem - it is reliance on guidelines 3 and 4 that are going to prove more helpful, along with checkpoints 6.1, and 6.2.  </s>
