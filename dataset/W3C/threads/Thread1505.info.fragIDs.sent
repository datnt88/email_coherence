<s> We're definitely interested in creating a validation suite.  </s>
<s> I'm probably going to be focusing on the JSR-147 "WVCM" effort for a while (defining a Java client-side API to the DeltaV/WebDAV protocol), and that effort requires a validations suite.  </s>
<s> So given the close coupling between WVCM and DeltaV/WebDAV, we should be able to derive a DeltaV/WebDAV validation suite from the WVCM validation suite.  </s>

<s> That model is missing a goodly amount of stuff, and should be considered as just a very preliminary pass at creating such a model.  </s>
