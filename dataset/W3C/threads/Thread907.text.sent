With default options, Tidy (both Cygwin port and Windows native) is converting my td &amp;nbsp; /td into td /td (actually td /td with the Windows version). 
Has no-one else seen this behaviour? 
Am I unique? 
;) Cheers, Phil Certain degree of user-error-at-line-2: It works ok with --quote-nbsp on in the command line. 
However, according to the docs, this should be on by default. 
So I think the default has got broken somewhere along the way. 
Cheers, Phil the in No, my error again. 
Or perhaps the documentation should state that "at least two cups of caffeine-based beverage should be consumed before trying to diagnose any perceived problem" ;) I'll think I'll just go and hide in a corner now... Cheers, Phil
