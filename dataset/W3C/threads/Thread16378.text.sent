I love the Internet! 
Many thanks to Larry Bouthillier, author of "Synchronized Multimedia On The Web" at URL: The answer is that: video src="http://38.201.92.250/ramgen/channels/able/car/carsilent.rm" region="videoregion"/ should instead be: video src="rtsp://38.201.92.250/channels/able/car/carsilent.rm" region="videoregion"/ RealPlayer media does REQUIRES a streaming server, which is quite an expensive product. 
Since I want to experiment with smil files, I need public files that are hosted by someone else! Can anyone point me to a RealPlayer file that has an offline transcript available (but not real time captioning)? 
I want to try my hand at making good my claim that synchronized captioning is not that hard! 
I am still trying to figure out how to suppress the "videoregion" if one is trying merely to produce real time caption of an audio-only broadcast. 
On Monday, December 20, 1999 12:34 PM, Charles McCathieNevile you should (as I recall the spec - this is really a SMIL question) have a type attribute in the video element. 
And you may find that isn't enough for Realplayer either - i believe it uses another scheme for addressing streaming documents, although I don't really know. 
Geoff -- I really did know that RealPlayer and SMIL were *not* the same think, but I assumed that G2 got it *right* -- but from what you write it sounds like we are in the good-old-bad-days like with Netscape and HTML 2.0! 
Are you saying that it is not possible to write a SMIL file that follows the W3C specs that also works as intended with RealPlayer? 
I am using the files contained in car.zip and elev1.zip posted at your site from URL: I have no way to confirm it with any certainty, but the "live" files are hosted by the Able channel at URL: From what (little) I know, one CANNOT download "live" SMIL files, even though they are plain ASCII text. 
(This is true of the binary RealMedia files too.) One would think that there is some clever way around this. 
Anyone on this list know the trick? 
The files don't seem to be kept in the browser cache either. 
Personally, I would MUCH rather just download the RealMedia (.rm) files (and play them offline), but I think keeping the source out the hands of the users is one of the products "features". 
I have mirror the files on my agency's site. 
I don't have the RealPlayer server software/hardware, so the files are just raw. 
You can't play them (you'll get an error message), but they will download. 
It would be nice if NCAM did this (hint, hint), especially since the audio and video tracks don't compress much (having the files in a single archive is nice though). 
The SMIL validation report can be found (for the time being) at URL: il/car.smi 
Geoff, you are in a position better than anyone to answer the question that got me started with this. 
Given a RealAudio file (like cardescen.rm) 
and captions (say, for example, carcapsen.rt), what does the WORKING .smi 
text file look like that plays WITHOUT a "videoregion"? 
(Or at least the minimum size necessary.) 
Thank you. 
-- Bruce On Monday, December 20, 1999 1:56 PM, geoff freed Hi, Bruce: I am curious to know what CAR file you used as a source, as there are a couple available. 
Also, there is at least one kludge built into the CAR.SMI file: the textregion contains a negative number: which is necessary due to a bug in the G2 Player's ability to center text properly. 
This will definitely screw up a validation report. 
Can you send me the report? 
Thanks. 
FYI, the text file used for the captions is a RealText file, which is proprietary to RealNetworks. 
That will also not validate properly. 
Geoff Freed WGBH/NCAM Bruce, To answer your question, no it is not very difficult to create captions with a Real G2 video presentation, just extremely time comsuming. 
If you download either the car.zip or the elev1.zip 
from the WGbh WEB SITE, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE CAPTIONED files are contained within a plain ascii text file. the trick is to get the text to appear on the screen in the proper format to be synchornized with the audio being played. 
At the start of each line of text is a time code which reflects the time on which the the text needs to appear to coincide with the audio stream of the video. 
not difficult, just very time consuming. the question you really have to ask is what do you do with the files after you create them. 
Unless you have the encoding software to put them all together in a multi-media presentation, you just have separate files. 
That doesn't include the Real G2 server which you need to have present if you wish to put these videos available on the web for viewing. 
I hope this helps answer some of your questions concerning this issue. 
The Able Channel will be leaving our tvontheweb web site at the end of the year. 
We are moving out on our own. 
If you wish to get in contact for more information, please stay tuned as I will announce our new web site with nothing but accesible videos being presented there. 
Questions/problems, please feel free to email me and I will try to answer any questions that I can. 
Jeff Pledger you should (as I recall the spec - this is really a SMIL question) have a type attribute in the video element. 
And you may find that isn't enough Realplayer either - i believe it uses another scheme for addressing documents, although I don't really know.
