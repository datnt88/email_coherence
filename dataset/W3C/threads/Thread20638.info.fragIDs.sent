<s> Sorry if this has been dealt with before, but I am having trouble building Amaya 4.2.1 from the source tarball.  </s>
<s> I created .../Amaya/solaris (this is on Solaris 2.7) and did "../configure --prefix=/devel/local" but it complained about not finding libwww sources.  </s>
<s> I retrieved w3c-libwww-5.3.2 and untarred it at the same level as Amaya and made a symlink to libwww.  </s>
<s> The configure then runs without error, but the "make all" blows up.  </s>
<s> It looks like after it completes the libpng it returns to the solaris directory and starts to rerun configure.  </s>
<s> It then complains "configure: error: source directory already configured; run make distclean there first" followed by "libwww is configured" then "/bin/sh: libwww/modules/md5: does not exist" Have I missed something obvious here?  </s>

<s> Hi, I didn't understand if you downloaded the source tar file or the CVS version.  </s>
<s> The source tar file is complete and include libwww sources.  </s>
<s> Installation form CVS is explained in our page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs .html  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Irene - This was from the source tar file, and I finally figured out what happened.  </s>
<s> After I unpacked the source, I started the ../configure, and at the same time I started deleting stuff from old versions of Amaya.  </s>
<s> I expected the libwww included with the source to be somewhere below the Amaya directory, not at the same level, so I deleted it thinking it was from an older version.  </s>
<s> I re-extracted, and everything configures and compiles fine.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, and sorry for my confusion.  </s>
