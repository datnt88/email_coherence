<s> Only some are commonly used.  </s>
<s> === COMMONLY USED for Browsing === GET - Retreive documents, used most by your web browser POST - Posting forms of HTML pages (commonly used) === HTTP/1.1 WEB EDITING === HEAD - Commonly used for testing hyperlinks (same as GET, but without data/content) PUT - Sending a file to a web server DELETE - Remove files === Admin === OPTIONS - Setting settings on a web server or proxy server??? don't know exactly.... TRACE - Tracing the path of a request through proxy servers and to a web server If you are building a simple HTTP/1.1 interface you should implement GET and POST HEAD can be done simply using the same code as GET, but you don't get the data/content) PUT/DELETE/e.d. should be implemented if you plan web publishing or authoring Since I was building a proxy server, these functions are mostly used (GET &amp; POST).  </s>
<s> If you build a proxy server, it's recommended to implement the CONNECT command for tunneling, but this not in your case (i think).  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 also supports authentication and much more methods to secure data on a web server.  </s>
<s> The PUT, DELETE, e.d. functions are not a security issue if they require you to authenticate with digest or NTLM authentication (or some alike).  </s>
<s> Also it's possible to use HTTPS for web publishing, what even protects the data being transmitted, useful for sensative documenents.  </s>
<s> So don't worry about security, just ensure you are making the library HTTP/1.1-compliant and are a bit compatible with HTTP/1.0, what should not be an issue if you follow the standards.  </s>

<s> I've found it very usefull when trying to determine what various proxies do to requests; it let's you see how the request arrived at the server (as opposed to what you sent).  </s>
<s> It serves the same purpose.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> No more so than any other security issue - the server can enforce whatever security it wants to for any method.  </s>
<s> It was meant to be a means of probing what features the server supported, but never really got finished in that no standard way of expressing much usefull information was specified.  </s>
<s> It is usefull as a no-op request for determining whether or not the server supports 1.1, or for carrying a request to upgrade (see "Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1" - draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-04.txt; approved as Proposed Standard but not yet out of the RFC Editors queue).  </s>
<s> Since HTTP is always initiated by the client, it cannot be forced to send any method, so in some sense it needn't support any methods it doesn't want to.  </s>
