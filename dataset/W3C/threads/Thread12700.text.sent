Greetings EOWG, I'm working on a collection of alternative browsers and screen-readers for one of the EO deliverables. 
this is for reference and to help check pages with different browsers and combinations of browsers and screen-readers. 
this may be discussed during Friday's meeting, and I'd welcome any suggestions for improvements or additions. 
In particular, there could be a third section for "mainstream alternative browsers" such as LYNX, Opera, net-tamer ..., would this be helpful? 
And can you let me have references for any others, Arach.... and others I can't call to mind. the first draft is at http://www.soundlinks.com/absr.htm. 
Regards, Peter.

Another alternative browser is the combination of w3 and emacspeak.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative - http://www.w3.org/WAI 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA Peter, This is a great start!! Thanks for getting this resource going. 
A few thoughts: Please, particularly since the page is using the W3C &amp; WAI logos, clearly mark at the top that this is a draft resource page for Education &amp; Outreach Working Group review. 
Also please add a sentence "This does not represent W3C or WAI endorsement of these products" Browsers: - Add a pointer to Avanti which has some cross-disability access features -- Daniel do you have a link for that? 
- and to Kurzweil which I believe has a browser add-on for learning disabilities. 
- add Lynx - isn't there also an alternative browser by "Bliss..."? - would be helpful to list product name and company name next to each other, since in some cases people are familiar with one but not the other. 
Classification: Categorization is a little confusing. 
We should probably clarify what "alternative browsers" itself means (maybe anything that's not a graphical desktop browser?) In terms of overall "user agent" categories, I think of (for starters): - graphical desktop browsers - text browsers - voice browsers - multimedia players - screen readers - other assistive technologies that work with browsers - though the lines between these get unclear at times, and "voice browsers" in particular is very unclear right now, so I'm not sure this would provide the best organizing structure. 
While this collection may have started as links to screen reader demos only, it may grow to list anything that's an "alternative" to graphical desktop browsers. 
I'm wondering then though whether it makes sense to list those as well, for reference, also since in some cases some access features are being built in. 
Besides, there are not that many to add: IE, Navigator, Opera, Amaya, etc. 
I would not make these the focus of the page -- seems like the focus of the page should be on the alternative access products. 
But let's discuss this more at our meeting tomorrow. 
Screen readers: Do any of the listed screen readers work with Braille output as well? 
I believe several do, but the intro to the listings is misleading then. 
Should be noted; also if there are others that support Braille but not speech those should be listed as well.

http://gippsnet.com.au/eiad/eiad.html 
Tango is used becuase it has good mulitlingual support. 
To clarify: Emacspeak is not a browser, it is a speech output system for Emacs. 
The fact that emacs can incorporate so many functions - a shell, editor, some browsers, mail package, etc, means that it is somewhere between a screenreader and a speech-output enviroment which can include a browser.

McLuhan, 1964 Does anyone know who I should talk to regarding how certain HTML tags and attributes function? 
For instance, Netscape says they've managed to get LONGDESC to function in their latest build of NGLAYOUT. 
However....they don't know how it should be implemented. 
They know it's supposed to be a URI but what happeneds if someone has a graphic that links somewhere else but also has a longdesc attribute? 
They allow the public to contribute to bug reports and I want to make sure all of this gets covered. 
Thanks.

BK, Yes, that's exactly what the User Agent Guidelines Working Group is for. 
Jon Gunderson is Chair, and I am cc'ing this message to him jongund@uiuc.edu . 
If you can put whoever at Netscape is actually working on accessibility implementations in touch with Jon, or even directly with the working group where it's been discussed, that would be appreciated all around. 
UAWG is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA .

There's the rub. 
It's not Netscape....it's the Mozilla Project. 
They don't have anyone assigned specifically to "accessibility implementations." 
They have several people assigned to HTML, Layout, Forms, and tables. 
I submitted a bug about the TABINDEX attribute for the A element and am about to do the same for the form elements. 
We need more than one person monitoring Mozilla to make sure they're on top of such issues. 
The reason why it is public is so we, as the users who will make use of Netscape 5.0, can make sure it has the features we want. 
The way to make sure the accessibility features get implemented/checked is to do the following: 1) Download one of the latest builds of NGLayout at: They have them for win32 2) Unzip it and run "viewer.exe" 
3) Direct the "browser" to a Web page with the feature you want to test. 
If it doesn't do what t is supposed to, submit it as a bug in the below sequence. 
Submitting a bug in NGLayout 1) Go to the Mozilla Project's NGLayout bug query page at 2) Using the Ctrl key on your keyboard, select all options under "status." 
They list many unimplemented HTML as done....because they don't know what they should be doing with it. 
The LONGDESC attribute is an example. 
3) Scroll down the page to an INPUT box that says "description." Enter in an HTML tag or attribute you want to check for. 
If you insert "longdesc" or "tabindex" in the description box, you'll see some of the current bugs. 
4) Click on "Submit Query." B.K. DeLong 360 Huntington Ave.

There is no recommended technique, it's really browser/platorm dependent. 
On Windows/IE, you can hit F14 or something like that, and get a propoerty sheet with a direct link to the longdesc doc. 
On another platform, right button click and a context sensitive menu. 
On another platform, a little D-link might be added inline. 
Well, it would be aprpeciated if someone go to the Mozilla Bug page and explain that they haven't fixed the LONGDESC problem if they don't offer one of the options you mentioned.

Supporting longdesc really means they need to provide easy end-user access to it. 
View Source, Cut&amp;Paste and Load is not a valid answer.
