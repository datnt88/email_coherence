Semantics of rdf:value See: 12: Datatypes Action: 2002-02-26#8 PatrickS Create XML examples for datatypes doc Issues with the current proposal: * The lack of XML examples (Patrick Stickler to provide) * Jeremy's entailment is a problem * Octal is not an XML Schema datatype * XML Schema datatypes do not support different language representations Proposed Issue: Its too complex; the doublet idiom was not completely removed.

This issue is now closed. 
I don't recall this being the decision I agreed to. 
I remember three bullet points: something about talking to the TAG, putting a "here be dragons" warning in the appropriate spec, and what is stated above. 
What happened to the other resolutions?

The TAG bit turned into 2002-02-25#20 DanC Highlight frag id semantics issue with the TAG I'd like to see actions kept near the relevant decisions... but if you're careful, I think you'll find all the essential stuff is in there. 
Though... hmm... 
I don't see an action representing the dragons bit. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 2002-02-25#19 Graham Draft text for the primer on use of frag id's with appropriate warnings re mime types Brian Sorry, a number of quibbles and/or (mis)clarifications with the agenda. 
[ I have a few from the f2f ... ] 2002-02-25#1 test001.rdf in the zip 2002-02-25#6 I had a few other actions that didn't get into the minutes. 
(already done: formalize one node, two node IRI example; I thought I had an action to produce the other test cases for not-id-and-resource. 
Not yet done: xml-base issues below) Never mind. 
Is this meant to be in response to: If so, can I draw the WG's attention to the test case examples I posted in: Do we think: 1: this is an RDF problem (i.e. present in the graph) 2: this is an XML problem (i.e. present in the XML serialization only) 3: this is not a problem (e.g. to be addressed, if at all, at the application layer) se.zip Excluding the error cases which have all been rejected. 
I have two actions to reposit them as positive cases. 
2002-02-25#16 replace xml:base error cases 1 and 2 with +ve test cases [f2f stuff seems garbled: IIRC I first had an action to replace 2 and 3 (which were easier decisions), and then I had an action to review DanC's analysis of case 1, and if I agreed to create a +ve case for error case 1. Hmmm... I guess that was subsumed by my action to write some words for the primer. 
I thought the relevant issues were raised, but the suggested text is under discussion. 
I note I did not make explicit mention of MIME types, other than to note application/RDF+XML??? as a special case.

Didn't we agree that there is one kind of literal and it is a triple? 
Having two kinds of literals suggests that we need more than just rdfs:Literal... Perhaps it was the two different NTriples representations suggested that gave an impression of two kinds of literals? 
Perhaps we should have a single consistent NTriples representation such that, the first 'field' is the parseType bit, the second field is the literal string, and the third field is either a language code or '*' and in NTriples syntax, all three fields are manditory: 0-"35"-* 0-"chat"-en 0-"chat"-fr 1-"foo em bar /em bas"-* etc. 
In the case of XML literals, the string would contain whatever canonicalized form is decided upon. 
The XML and N3 serializations can offer syntactic sugar if they like. 
E.g.. N3 can say that if either the first or third field is missing, they default to '0' and '*' respectively, so folks can just write in N3 Bob ex:age "35" . 
MyBook dc:title "Wooga"-en . 
Chap1 dc:title 1-" title Wooga /title " . 
which equate to the NTriples Bob ex:age 0-"35"-* . 
MyBook dc:title 0-"Wooga"-en . 
Chap1 x:head 1-" title Chapter 1 /title "-* . 
Eh? Done. 
Attached is an edited version of Pat's stake-in-the-ground datatyping summary. 
I expect that additional RDF/XML examples will be needed, and I will contribute those as they are identified. 
Cheers, Patrick
