Thanks to those who provided me with information about the caching problem with the proxy server... 
We were running a number of tests using Netscape, MSIE V5, Opera, Neoplanet browsers. 
We knew that the proxy server was dowgrading the response. 
Based on the references provided by Jeff and other document Q222064 ("Pragma: no-cache" Tag May Not Prevent Pages from Being Cached) and Q234067 (Prevent Caching in Internet Explorer) (from MS Support) explain why the web page was still being cached by the browser. 
The strange thing was the pages were not being cached by Netscape - even with HTTP/1.0. 
A problem still exists at the browser end however. 
From a security end we know that HTTP/1.0 has flaws (especially when you introduce a web browser), but it raises the question of how many proxy server are there which only implement HTTP/1.0. 
All it seems to takes is a single proxy server for a response to be downgraded, and for the browser to receive that downgraded response and (correctly?) ignore any settings that are not associated with the protocol identifier in the response - such as Cache-Control headers. 
Regards, Tim C. to Incorrectly. 
If a browser supports the Cache-Control header field for any HTTP/1.x response, then it should support it for every HTTP/1.x response. 
The definition of an HTTP header field is defined by the major number, not the minor number. 
....Roy For MSIE there is reason to believe that the browser will cache documents with: "Cache-Control: no-cache", since MSIE's feature "Work Offline". 
Maybe that "must-revalidate" is never cached by the browser, since commercial banners usually asked to be retreived from the server when working offline. 
It is possible that objects are not retreived from cache when working offline is disabled. 
To validate this, you should search of ask Microsoft. 
And indeed Roy seems to be right. 
A HTTP/1.1 proxy/server should not serve requests for HTTP/2.0 or later clients, but may do it for a HTTP/1.9 or HTTP/1.10 request according to the HTTP/1.1 RFC. 
This is outlined in the RFC. 
This is one failure of the MS-IIS, that serves HTTP/2.0 or later requests, even though it is only a HTTP/1.1 server. 
Netscape doesn't do this... Protocol changes that are not compatible with HTTP/1.x should be HTTP/2.0 and not HTTP/1.2 (or any)... - Joris From: Fielding, Roy [mailto:fielding@eBuilt.com] Sent: Wednesday, 08 November 2000 23:50 Subject: RE: Thanks Re Caching Problem
