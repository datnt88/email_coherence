EOWG folks, 
The 4 main sub pages of the "business case" (Social Factors, Technical 
Factors, Financial Factors, and Legal &amp; Policy Factors) are ready for 
final content review. 
(I will do one more pass at "wordsmithing" and copyediting of these pages.) I have not edited the Overview at all and it needs a rewrite, and the new References page is just notes dumped in and needs lots of work. 
For the Friday 26 March teleconference, please focus your content review on the following pages: - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html  
Social Factors - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html  
Technical Factors - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/econ.html  
Financial Factors 
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html  
Legal &amp; Policy 
Factors 
and the following issues: a. Are all topics covered? 
How is the depth of coverage (not too much, yet enough to explain)? 
Are the topics covered in the right page? 
Are the appropriately referenced from other pages in which they apply? 
b. 
How does the new format (having customization questions first) work? 
(It seems to me to work very well in Social Factors. 
In Legal &amp; Policy Factors, it is too repetitive with the "Considerations for Different Types of Organizations" section (in a previous e-mail I offered ideas for addressing this). 
In Technical Factors the questions section doesn't seem necessary, but I think OK to leave for consistency. 
In Financial Factors, it seems a little bit redundant with the rest of it, but probably will be good after a little tweaking.) Please also see additional review questions in e-mail sent to the list on Monday 15 March, archived at: IMPORTANT NOTE: Please send comments to the appropriate list.

Hi Shawn, WRT the references page, this is the start of a page I was preparing ages ago for the Auxiliary Benefits document - some of it may still be useful.
