Hi ERT group, I have produced an Xform that allows people to do an evaluation of a document against WCAG 1.0 and generate EARL according to the 1.0 spec (plus some dublin core and and foaf for things that aren't in the schema, and in my opinion don't need to be). 
It's online at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/axforms/earlform.xml - but at the moment it will store the result on the W3C site, if you have a password to put it there (otherwise it won't work). 
You can download the relevant parts and run them locally - there are four files in a package at To make it work you need an Xforms-capable browser. 
I have been using Xsmiles 0.8 - http://www.xsmiles.org 
- on a macintosh and it works fine, but feedback and bug reports are welcome. 
(Trying to install this system on Windows needed java, which turned out to be a pain, so I ahven't tested it there yet). 
My plans for this are to make it post the results to the EARL/Annotea server, but I need to change a namespace setting there first. 
More documentation coming soon - the form itself has a brief to-do list which should give some idea owhat I hope it will do. 
Don't forget that your effort in getting Xforms-capable will be repaid by also being able to generate foaf/codepiction data using the materials at information can be used.

what i would miss in such a report is some reasoning why a certain checkpoint failed. 
but again, i guess this information might only be interesting for site developers. 
it would be great if the validation tools could provide such a complete and consistent report of the conducted tests... best, shadi 
There is an earl:message property that would allow adding such an explanation. 
Real tools and people test against a number of sub-criteria - if I had a lot of time I could add stuff so that you could have degrees of failed, and finer grained information as well as just a message. 
I'll put the emssage bit on the todo list - anyne else is welcome to hack further, of course... cheers Chaals

I added the ability to put in a comment (as an earl:message property). 
(One task off the todo list...) cheers Chaals
