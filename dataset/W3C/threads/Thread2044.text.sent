The TITLE entity header field, like the LINK field have an explicit correlation with the same HTML tag; but MUST a server process an HTML file to extract these values or a Server can ignore them even if it receives an explicit request of these fields ???? 
I think the title field is poorly motivated wrt a HTML document. 
I see little advantage in getting the Title of the document up a few packets earlier. 
There is an issue with the HEAD method however, if one does a head then one wishes to obtain meta-information relating to the entity without obtainig a body and hence Title does have some use. 
Title and link are rather more usefull when dealing with content types which do not provide for header or link attributes. 
It is usefull to add a title to a JPEG or GIF, it would have been nice if Link could be used to add links into such objects - ie client side image maps. 
Overall I'm not too keen on the link tag/header because I don't think that anyone has proposed a comprehensive and coherent semanitcs for them. 
My view of what link should be is annotations in the Hyper-G model. 
Ie they should be used to inform a client about links which relate to an entity which are not a part of it. 
Annotations are one example. 
This model would indicate a need to incorporate a position indicator into the tag: Link: http://www.cern.ch/TheBook/chapter2 ; rel="Previous"; pos=1654-1754 Where pos in this case is a simple character offset. 
I suspect that we really need a comprehensive notation for describing positions within a hypertext structure.

Davide Davide Musella Institute for Multimedia Technologies, National Research Council, Milan, ITALY e-mail: davide@jargo.itim.mi.cnr.it http://jargo.itim.mi.cnr.it/ yes, I was thinking about it. 
The problem is how a server can extract this meta info?? doing a full text parsing? 
isn't it too heavy?? 
A robot could have many advantages using only HEAD request to retrieve all the meta info related to an html file...but which server handle this kind of info?? 
Why don't insert among the entity header fields the content of the META HTTP-EQUIV tag??? a proposal is in the draft-ietf-html-relrev-00.txt.
