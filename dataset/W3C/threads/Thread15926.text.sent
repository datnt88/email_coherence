Though I generally "lurk" as a subscriber to this group and use the comments of others as useful reference, the Washington Post column on web accessibility struck more than one nerve and I felt compelled to submit my letter to the editor here as well. 
I welcome any comments on this letter although it has already been submitted. 
Keep in mind, I too, found it necessary to "calm down" before drafting a version I felt made my views known without the anger that was readily apparent in the first several drafts. 
My letter follows: William Raspberry's Monday, November 16, 1998 commentary, "Claims Against Common Sense" (Page A25) is obviously one based on a lack of understanding of the scope of the internet as a medium for information dissemination and the point of ADA regulation as a whole. 
I for one, take offense at the patronizing effort to soften the blow of the comments to the disadvantaged community. 
I am a web developer and have personal experiences with the obstacles disadvantaged Americans face on a daily basis. 
Devices do exist to lessen the burden of being visually or hearing challenged. 
However, if the persons responsible for designing information systems are ignorant of these devices or take the attitude that the effort is superfluous, these tools cannot do what they were designed for. 
If more developers made the effort to educate themselves in proper design techniques and cared more about the information they were delivering than the way it's presented instead of the other way around, most cases like Mr. Tamez's wouldn't come up. 
Should we assume from your statement "?someone already has ? 
something that works quite well for most of us?" that making a reasonable effort to broaden the reach of the web to include persons with visual impediments is, and I quote, "a clear violation of common sense"? 
Should we also then assume that if we were once again faced with addressing the issue of public building accessibility that because steps work quite well for most of us that it would not make sense to spend the time and money on constructing handicap ramps? 
Perhaps also the addition of handicap ramps to historic buildings was not advisable since this was perceived to detract from the style and grace of the original 18th and 19th century architecture. 
We applaud the ADA efforts in these areas now that we have already overcome the vast majority of obstacles in implementing them. 
But let's remember how we got to where we are today in achieving broader access to public facilities. 
I'm sure most of us over the age of 25 can recall the "whining" that took place in the 80's about public facility accessibility; and in the early 90's the "whining" by those responsible for making the changes that would constitute compliance with the ADA. 
But now we all accept ADA compliance as the right thing to do when discussing the ramps at City Hall or the Public Library. 
There will be situations where the term "reasonable access" will mean alternative methods of accessing information are appropriate. 
However, in dealing with text information on the web, as in a train or bus schedule, it is possible to present the information in an accessible fashion without compromising the "attraction for the rest of us", or requiring multiple versions of the document. 
This requires little more effort or expense on the part of the agencies or individuals responsible for putting the info out than what they would be faced with in upgrading or changing their office word processor package. 
I don't find an effort to reach the broadest possible audience unreasonable or "a violation of common sense" when your information is intended for the general public. 
If you don't think the information is worth that effort then why put it out in the first place? 
Let's not forget that our schools, government, and private institutions in providing services to the public, have a reasonable responsibility to make their services, whether online or not, accessible in similarly convenient fashion to all their customers. 
Having to pick up the phone and call the organization, perhaps dealing with busy signals and/or long hold times and other nuisances promote the use of the internet as a preferred method of accessing information by all persons. 
Being told I must wait to receive the info by mail, or have someone begrudgingly read it to me because of a visual impairment, instead of being able to use the Internet, does not constitute similarly convenient. 
For those interested in ensuring that their organization is making their information accessible to the broadest possible audience I recommend looking at the efforts of the World Wide Web Consortium at Upon reading the original article which led to this entire discussion, my only observation would be that I have hardly ever encountered a more incoherent attempt at an argument. 
On the positive side, the page author guidelines already make it quite clear that universal design does not involve relinquishing those multimedia aspects of the web that so many find attractive.

Try on a Sunday to get information from a transit company. 
Increasingly the Web is the main source. 
The web _will_ be the ONLY main source soon. 
This is the future. 
The world is heading that way. 
The steps that we take NOW, the fights we fight and the battles we win at the EARLY stages of the game, will mean EVERYTHING to future accessibility for everyone. 
That is why it's so vitally important to get the word out NOW, and make our presence heard, because otherwise those "without" (without the latest tech, without a big budget for hardware, without the ability to see, without a fast connection) will be left behind, possibly forever.

The voice of the future? 
If disabled citizens are not exempt from local, state, or federal taxes, why should they be "exempt" from local, state, or federal government services? 
There are certainly more arguments to be made, but to me that one is quite sufficient.

For what it's worth, here is my letter to Mr. Raspberry. 
Perhaps I'm overly self-indulgent, but I just didn't feel the need to be very diplomatic about it. 
Raspberry's views stem from resentment, not from rational thought, so my letter is more an attempt to register my disgust than to change his mind. 
I'm not sure rational arguments can overcome prejudice, but perhaps seeing things from a different perspective (that of the victim), can: Dear Mr. Raspberry, Just finished reading your column on Mr. Tamez and his frivolous complaint. 
I couldn't agree with you more! 
What a great column! 
It's about time that someone spoke up. 
I just wish you'd gone a little farther. 
My wife and I recently moved from Oregon to Seattle. 
Our neighborhood is nice and clean, and our neighbors are all the kind of people you'd want to be around. 
So imagine our shock when we went to enroll our kids in the local school and discovered that probably 25% of the students are black! 
There used to be a time in this country when they had their schools and we had ours. 
What happened? 
Now they come into our schools, and it just ruins the aesthetics of the place. 
They can't even speak English properly! 
The way they dress, the music they listen to... it's disgusting! 
What was wrong with having separate schools for them? 
They had access to an education! 
So it wasn't as good as the education in the white schools. 
So what! 
Why should all of us have to suffer just so they can enjoy the luxury of a good education? 
And what really pisses me off is that I have to subsidize it with MY taxes! 
Let them stay in their own neighborhoods and go to their own schools, not ruin the beauty and friendliness of ours. 
After reading what you had to say about those whiny handicapped people, I'm sure you'll agree that we should put those whiny blacks back in their places, too. 
Tell me, Mr. Raspberry, did you really mean to espouse the disenfranchisement of a entire group of people simply because it's occasionally inconvenient for you? 
Do you really believe that equal access to power (the real issue here) is a luxury? 
Shame on you.
