I agree with Lisa. 
(other than the comment "somebody could set the 'DAV:checked-in' property to ANY value" because (1) just 'somebody' should not be using the DAV: namespace, especially without consideration of the current specs., (2) servers should enforce (1), and (3) servers that did have an opionion about DAV:checked-in would definitely disallow setting any value, so clients would fail very early.)

ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org Subject: RE: Core versioning issues and nits I agree that determining type by the absence of properties is sub-optimal; I'd say it's not very reliable. 
How is it any less reliable than looking for a particular value in a "resourcetype" property? 
A particular value on a particular property can be preserved even when the protocol changes (whether the protocol is changing as a result of sanctioned IETF activity or independent vendor activity). 
Also, a particular value on a particular property is less likely to appear "by accident". 
In contrast, the absence of a property is less likely to be preserved when extending the protocol: somebody will come up with a new useful value for the property, and break clients that relied on that property being absent. 
Or, on an non-versioning server like IIS 5.0 that supports dead properties, somebody could set the "DAV:checked-in" property to ANY value, and no matter what value it's set to, it risks breaking clients that look for that property. 
I'm not saying this is broke (particularly if the DAV:supported-methods comes back as a property). 
It's just not as reliable as I would prefer. 
Lisa I think that the spec. 
should explicitly reserve all names in the DAV namespace. 
Application properties should be limited to other namespaces. 
That would avoid this problem. 
Agreed, but there is already a notable client that does use this namespace.

Dear Colleagues, I think that the spec.

Agreed, but there is already a notable client that does use this namespace. 
Dear Tim, I think we should do it anyway, with the note that the ones used by said client(s) are grand-fathered. 
Let the guilty list their sins (;-), by naming what tags they already have in use. 
Of course the list must be in the spec. 
At least then, we can keep the problem from getting worse. 
Sincerely, James
