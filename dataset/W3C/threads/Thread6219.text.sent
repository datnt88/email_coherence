It would appear that we could be in danger of allowing the term 'Semantic Web' fall into the hands of the marketing people slightly sooner than we had hoped. 
I suspect the majority of you who've had reservations over using the term in the past feel that we could be running before we can walk. 
This is true. 
We do need to be careful in our classifications of the technologies we are developing. 
I would like to cite a recent discussion I had with some colleagues at work. 
I tried to present to them RDF using the angle of what the technology could hold for developing a network of metadata (or a 'semantic web', if you will). 
Although my presentation started as just that - a presentation - we quickly lapsed into discussions about where RDF can and probably will go. 
The opinion of some very experienced people - whom have seen the rise and fall of previous 'killer technologies' - seemed to think that RDF wouldn't be used for the purposes of describing web pages, etc. Rather, that it would still be successful, but probably be employed in some other technology probably totally unrelated to realising the 'semantic web' vision. 
Such as the rise and fall of HTML, from its initial incarnation to the presentational-emphasis language we have today. 
As a student of the field, I'd consider my opinions and views fresh and relatively untainted, and I tend to agree with my colleagues. 
RDF just seems too complex to be adopted my the masses for the purpose it was intended. 
The technology is so powerful, however, that it will almost certainly find a purpose somewhere. 
If, however, we can limit the contact people have to have with raw RDF (or even raw semantic modelling - to a certain extent) through well-designed, user-friendly, powerful applications, then we can help stop the RDF drift away from where it would do most good, and help realise the technology. 
I realise that most of what I've said is contentious, so let's discuss!

I agree. 
However, the global pool of information must be communicated using some technology. 
If we, as the people who have enough collective knowledge to thrash out these issues, do not lay the correct foundations and isolate the users from any complex mechanics, then we are going to loose the play. 
They simply will not adopt our new technology.

MIMEsweeper: Policy-based Content Security The word mechanics reminds me of the interplay between "statistical mechanics" and thermodynamics. 
The first describes phenomena on the micro level and the second on the macro level. 
Small scale bits like XML/RDF are the substrate of any scheme to build a semantic level. 
In reality, I cannot see how an idea such as "user driven semantics" would work in terms of how RDF evolves. 
And Great store was put in LISP and Prolog to build AI systems.

To me, one of the most intriguing aspects of TBL's description of a Semantic Web is the parallel with the *flaws* of the WWW. 
There were many people in the 80's working on hypermedia systems, and a significant reason that they stalled and the WWW took off is that they cared about ensuring consistency, bidirectional links, etc., and Tim was willing to let go of that. 
The result is  1 billion WWW pages, and probably  10 billion links. 
A small percentage of the pages are broken, but on the whole the WWW provides tremendous value. 
Similarly, I view most of what has been done in AI as focused on consistency, correctness, etc., which (so far) has limited the successes it can claim. 
If you're looking for a Semantic Web that can give you "truth", we've got a long wait. 
If you're looking for something that improves search results through related concepts and simple inferences, in a few years you should be able to get something that's useful, but not perfect. 
-Matt Jensen NewsBlip Seattle Any idea why it can't be done this year? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Well, I was trying to cover myself :-) I'm imagining that first a group of technologists has to "agree" on some kind of standard, and then their work has to be adopted by a large enough group of webmasters for the whole thing to be "useful". 
However, because the Web is described by Zipf's law [1], you might get good value out of convincing "only" the top 100 sites (in page views) to implement your semantic system. 
Then a form of Metcalfe's law [2] applies, where other web sites have more and more reasons to join. 
-Matt Jensen NewsBlip Seattle [1] http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/wli/zipf/ 
[2] http://www.mgt.smsu.edu/mgt487/mgtissue/newstrat/metcalfe.htm 
One thing that does seem to be lacking in the WWW is one to many linsks, which do exist in other hypermedia systems. 
Is this not a serious "flaw"? 
Rule based systems, yes that was a requirement that was in fact often missing. 
Many other appraoches had no need for consistency (e.g. genetic algorithms). 
I would not wait for truth, personally. 
Something about relating truth and to AI makes me uneasy.... Gordo.

Too late for that. 
The web is now a commercial playground, not a research "sandbox". 
All website built for commercial organisations and many others (such http://www.bbc.co.uk/) are governed by people who are not interested in creating shared space. 
They just want to keep you in their domain or in the case of portals click through to controlled set of websites. 
Have you proved that the described by Zipf's law? 
With which parameters? 
Links? 
Pages? 
Pageviews?

Can we keep the pessimism out and be realistic. 
Comments like these have a tendency to tack off topic. 
Frank V. Castellucci No, I haven't proved it, but others have, with regard to requested URLs. 
Scroll down in footnote [1] until you see the section titled "Zipf's law in Web Access Statistics." 
There are 18 academic papers cited. 
Probably the most popular non-academic page describing this is Jakob Nielsen's page, "Zipf Curves and Website Popularity", at -Matt Jensen NewsBlip Seattle Jakob Nielsen shows that both "page requests" (for a site such as "The figure shows incoming page-requests to a single site. 
Other studies have found that Zipf curves characterize the outgoing page requests from the employees of an organization (there are a few pages that everybody look at and a large number of pages that are seen only once)." 
So the law applies for "page popularity" plotted against "hits per month" (his terminology). 
*****     earlier it was said... Yes, to convince them. 
But like HTML (the well know computer virus), inertia rules. 
Did PNG take off like a rocket? 
Answer - no. 
And that was a very simple in comparison.

There is no network effect in PNG adoption, but there would be in Semantic Web adoption. 
If ABCNews.com were to support a semantic standard, I now have more of an incentive to support the standard on my own site; I'll be able to make inferences with ABCNews.com's content. 
-Matt Jensen NewsBlip Seattle When I worked at the BBC (circa 1995-1997), I wanted the BBC to define its own DTD (in XML) for similar reasons. 
But my position was a producer, not a senior manager. 
I felt the BBC could lead on the adoption of XML.

Let me propose the glass-is-half-empty scenario, which I think to be much more likely: network effects also prevent systems from being adopted. 
If ABCNews.com were to *not* support a semantic standard, then I now have more of an excuse to *not* spend all that time supporting this standard on my own site. 
I think the right way to view the PNG situation is that it didn't take off like a rocket *despite* having no nework inertia to hold it down. 
This causes Luke's First Law :-), namely quality is inversely proportional to popularity. 
Browser support? 
As I user, I like PNG but my browser does not support it. 
Is that it?

I imagine the only realistic way to get a semantic standard accepted is through standards hegemony. 
It's nice to see W3C behind it, but I don't think it's a sufficient hegemon. 
Microsoft probably is, assuming they decide to actually go full-bore with RDF (or whatnot). 
This is made even tougher by the fact that I have yet to see a killer application for RDF with regard to the average joe (or Joe Business) on the web. 
Lots of nifty applications. 
But no *killer* application, without which it may be difficult to justify the infrastructure expenditure.
