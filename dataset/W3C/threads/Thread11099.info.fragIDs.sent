<s> From: Peter Murray-Rust Peter@ursus.demon.co.uk ... when I demonstrate this facility to people who haven't seen XML before, and tell them it *comes free with the [draft] language* they are impressed.  </s>
<s> It's a very strong selling point over other approaches.  </s>
<s> I just conducted the technical half of a day-seminar on XML.  </s>
<s> They gave an ovation at the end (because of excitement about XML, not my fascinating teaching postures :-) They were most impressed with SHOW and ACTUATE.  </s>
<s> I think their view was that these are simple enough to do lots of wonderful things.  </s>
<s> It would make sense, I guess, if XML 2.0 had a link behaviour specification language, I think SHOW and ACTUATE provide nice, generic defaults and they should *definitely* be kept in XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> They asked about how what gets returned by a ID(x1)..ID(x2) when these ids of element in  </s>
<s> different branches of the element tree: does just the text get returned or does a clipped tree  </s>
<s> get returned or what.  </s>
<s> If text is returned, is it XML.. I didn't know.  </s>
<s> Any ideas yet?  </s>
<s> One thing to do (I guess Elliot "Dr Fragment" Kimber is more on top of the issues) would be:  </s>
<s> traversing a link with pointer ID(x1)..ID(x2) to would get a document like this:  </s>
<s> I don't see how we can have .. between branches without also specifying some fragment  </s>
<s> exchange conventions, since otherwise the XML document must be well-deformed and invalid.  </s>
<s> Another approach would be an index into the actual character of the document (RS=nominal record  </s>
<s> start =~ start of line).  </s>
<s> Lets assume that fragments are always generated by computer, and that no transcoding goes on that changes the number of characters, and that any header adjustments get done before the doctype.  </s>
<s> The document could be pruned of data outside the range, and any optional outside elements, if the implementor felt like it, for efficiency reasons.  </s>
<s> If we don't define a fragment convention, I think xml-link spec will have to say that ranges that span branches are only possible on the client, i.e. with "#" not "?XML-LINK=".  </s>
<s> [Of course they ask about regexp :-)].  </s>
<s> No. Mine didn't: they were commmercial HTML &amp; SGML suppliers, from legal &amp; CALS areas mainly,  </s>
<s> and they were more interested in users being able to access information only by the elements  </s>
<s> the providers had marked up.  </s>
<s> They generally don't want users to play with the data.  </s>

<s> In all of these discussions, it's critical to keep separate the source, which is what XML lang (like SGML) defines the rules for, and the parsed result of processing that source, which is what XML Link (like HyTime) operates on.  </s>
<s> Once the documents have been put into memory, issues like well-formedness and even validity go away, because those are syntax issues, and syntax is transcended once the document is parsed (and only resurface when you want to create a new source document).  </s>
<s> Validation is only an issue if you make it one--editors, for example, have states where validation issues are ignored.  </s>
<s> Browsers may never care about  </s>
<s> validity because it doesn't matter if the document conforms to a particular  </s>

<s> Perhaps it's better to say that validity *can be ignored* in the abstraction, not that it goes away.  </s>

<s> Whether the string that existed in the pre-parsed XML document is a useful thing to retrieve and process apart from its context is application-dependent.  </s>
