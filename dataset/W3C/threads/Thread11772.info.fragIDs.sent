We need to get a revised copy of the working draft to the IG group for review so that we can publish a new public working draft on schedule. 
The following is a draft in which we have attempted to make the changes that were agreed upon by the group. 
The most glaring ommissions are that we have not yet been able to draft a merger of the four guidelines as discussed in the conference call and that we have not divided checkpoints into techniques and checkpoints. 
With those provisos, do people agree that the document reflects the present consensus of the group? 
This doesn't mean that you are personally happy with the document, but that no changes have been made without the agreement of the group. 
Please respond by 5pm Thursday. 
Thanks Jutta
