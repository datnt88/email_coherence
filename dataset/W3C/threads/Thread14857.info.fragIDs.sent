<s> In today's meetings we were able to remove the following items from the BIG ISSUES OPEN list.  </s>
<s> Here are the closed ones...  </s>
<s> The updated list is at the bottom.  </s>
<s> NOTE: BIG ISSUES are issues that span many guidelines or which affect the guidelines but would not be touched on in discussions of individual guidelines or checkpoints.  </s>
<s> ITEMS 2 &amp; 4 were removed since they were determined to be part of specific guidelines.  </s>
<s> 2. User literacy level - (is this is a sub part of 3.3 /3.4 discussion) - reading levels 4. What is an equivalent?  </s>
<s> - (collapsed back to 1.1) ITEMS WERE REMOVED BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSED BY FACE TO FACE DISCUSSION AND CONSENSUS STATEMENTS. 7. Normative vs. informative (do we need normative?)  </s>
<s> YES - and we created some consensus statements for what would be  </s>
<s> normative. 8. One version for all vs. multiple versions of web content - client-side vs. server-side  </s>
<s> Server side ok - see consensus statement.  </s>
<s> 11. Do we intend guidelines to be used by regulators and requirements-setters (e.g., in companies)?  </s>
<s> YES - see consensus statement.  </s>
<s> ITEMS WERE CLOSED IN TODAYS DISCUSSION. 3. Differences by language (CMN) COLLAPSED INTO #1 AS : "...remember that the user agents available, and their capabilities, differ for different locations, languages, and localizations." 5. How document is interpreted by non-technical people CONSENSUS: Our document should be written as clearly and simply as is appropriate for the content, with links to definitions.  </s>
<s> We should go with the clearest and simplest language that someone can propose as long as it is accurate.  </s>
<s> We also had the following consensus candidate for #1 but we did not close it yet RE: BROWSERS B1 - Techniques should specify if particular browsers are needed or will not work with the technique.  </s>
<s> Or they should specify if they require particular technologies.  </s>
<s> e.g.  </s>
<s> You must have CSS2 support for this technique to work.  </s>

<s> 1. Baseline browser capabilities - in general - in specific contexts (intranet, public kiosk) - remember that the user agent's available, and their capabilities, differ for different locations, languages, and localizations.  </s>

<s> In my role as co-chair, I shall here summarize the arguments which have been made, in the past, with respect to some of the outstanding "big issues" on Gregg's list.  </s>
<s> This should enable us to proceed without retracing old ground too much.  </s>
<s> When we last considered this issue, the following arguments were raised against taking difficulty of implementation into account: a. Difficulty of implementation depends very much on circumstances (what is difficult for one person, or using one technology, may be comparatively easy in other contexts).  </s>
<s> Correcting web content that has already been written, may or may not be more difficult than writing new content according to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Difficulty also varies with the resources available to the developer (time, expertise, etc.), which can vary significantly.  </s>
<s> b. Difficulty is a relative concept for which there are no agreed measures or criteria.  </s>
<s> c.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are not regulations; it is the purpose of laws to take difficulty and concepts of "unjustifiable hardship" into account, but it would be inappropriate to do so in a technical Recommendation.  </s>
<s> d.  </s>
<s> Any judgments about difficulty made in the guidelines are likely to be overridden, in effect, by the legal requirements imposed by anti-discrimination law, which vary from one jurisdiction to another.  </s>
<s> Faced with a conflict, developers are likely to turn to the legal requirements rather than the guidelines in determining what is reasonable.  </s>
<s> e.  </s>
<s> This working group doesn't have the expertise to make judgments about difficulty.  </s>
<s> I don't recall any strong arguments supporting the proposition that difficulty should be taken into account in defining WCAG 2.0 priorities.  </s>
<s> Some have criticized the WCAG 1.0 conformance scheme on the ground that it creates unwelcome incentives by admitting only three levels of conformance corresponding to the three priority levels of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The only other comment regarding difficulty of implementation which I recall, is Len's suggestion that it be clearly separated out from the guidelines and the priority scheme, if it is to be mentioned at all.  </s>
<s> Another issue often discussed in this connection is the relevance of the author's intended audience in determining where the demarcation should lie.  </s>
<s> Of course, as has frequently been pointed out, it is not legitimate for a developer to define the intended audience by explicitly excluding persons with disabilities, as this would defeat the entire purpose of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The question remains, however, of the role of the intended audience in determining what measures a developer should take, especially under guideline 3, and how this should be explained in the document.  </s>
<s> It is also a consensus statement that we should provide whatever techniques are available and appropriate, to enable developers to implement a broad range of access solutions.  </s>
<s> I thought we decided that these guidelines were intended to cover all web sites, but that (as a later project) it would be appropriate to write documents explaining how to customize sites for particular audiences.  </s>
<s> At least, that is my impression of where the matter stood when it was last considered.  </s>
<s> There were also suggestions that techniques documents were appropriate locations for such information but that it was of secondary importance by comparison with the group's underlying purpose of writing guidelines applicable to web sites in general.  </s>
<s> Server-side techniques may address this issue to some extent.  </s>
<s> A difficult issue, which is compounded by a lack of adequate definitions.  </s>
<s> Query whether this distinction is a useful one.  </s>
<s> I don't recall any groundbreaking arguments or insights in this area.  </s>
<s> There has been plenty of discussion of this point, with few concrete proposals to date.  </s>
<s> At the checkpoint level, I think it is agreed that conformance means satisfying the success criteria, and that the technology/issue-specific documents will specify how to satisfy the success criteria of each relevant checkpoint using the technology under consideration, or (as in core techniques) under various circumstances.  </s>
<s> We also know that conformance testing will be partially automated by suitable software and that the Evaluation and Report Language is available to encapsulate the results in a machine-readable format.  </s>
<s> Can this issue be clarified?  </s>
<s> I don't know what it means.  </s>
<s> Same comment as per 14--I don't know what the issue is.  </s>
<s> In the above summary I have tried to capture the essence of the relevant arguments, where possible, on all sides.  </s>
<s> In part it means that the author's employer makes appearance demands that MUST be satisfied and sometimes these interfere with the user's NEEDS.  </s>
<s> How things "look" (a retinal conceit) often transcends their accessibility in the market place.  </s>
<s> Same with clarity/simplicity - author's peers are put off by use of less-than-lofty phraseology.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
