I think it is difficult to estimate the costs, there are so many factors that influence the time and cost. 
For the guidelines to be implemented broadly they must be integrated into authoring tools, so that most authors will not even know they are creating accessible materials. 
In this case the user will not even perceive a cost. 
So I don't think looking at todays tools and workloads is a very important issue in determining the checkpoints in the document. 
Nobody would of started putting in concrete curbcuts and ramps if they would have looked at the costs or retrofitting street, but the benefits to all people (not just people with disabilities) is well documented. 
The guidelines foremost concern should be defining the principles to make web documents more accessible. 
Jon What level of responsibility does the Working Group have to ensure that the overall work load caused by the checkpoints is resonable and practical for Web content developers to bear? 
I think that the Working Group is agreed that the feasibility of implementing a checkpoint must not influence the priorty assigned to the checkpoint. 
Nevertheless, I have argued that issues of cost and feasibility must influence whether the checkpoint is included in the guidelines at all. 
Elaborating upon that thought, I would like to suggest that the Working Group needs to look not only at the work load associated with each individual checkpoint, but also whether the cumulative load imposed by the entire set of checkpoints is reasonable. 
To do otherwise, one could still have a guideline document for which the each checkpoint had an accurate priority rating but for which the triple-A (or other level) of conformance was impractical for all but a few Web content developers to implement. 
I believe that it is entirely within the purview (and opportunity) of the Working Group ensure that, in its opinion, the work load imposed by the triple-A conformance level is reasonable practical for the majority of Web content developers. 
To reiterate the question, is it within the scope of work of the Working Group to evaluate the guidelines from the standpoint of overall workload upon the Web content developer? 
If so, what process is or should be in place to perform this task?

I agree with Jon. 
Also, as I have previously argued, the document is intended to specify the requirements that must, may and should be met (in other words at three levels of priority) in order to make web-based information accessible. 
Considerations of cost are irrelevant except when deciding between two equally effective accessibility solutions, one of which is more costly than the other. 
All solutions proposed by the guidelines are technically feasible in that they can be implemented using available technologies and standards.
