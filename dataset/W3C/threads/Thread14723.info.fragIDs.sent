<s> Hi, Web page developers seem to prefer tables over CSS for much layout.  </s>
<s> Has anyone done any testing of how long it takes to create a layout using tables and then do a similar testing of producing the same layout using CSS?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott  </s>
<s> Just from a developer who does this daily - I can layout a page with tables in about a 1/4 of the time to do it with css (or even less depending on  </s>
<s> complexity).  </s>
<s> The reason being is that every browser handles css so differently.  </s>
<s> Tables are pretty straight forward and the results are almost the same across browsers.  </s>
<s> But I will go back and forth between browsers with css - fixing it in one, then destroying it in another and vice versa.  </s>

<s> Hi, The other question I forgot to ask was is how much easier is it to learn and master tables as compared to CSS for layout?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott  </s>
<s> Both of these things are really tricky to learn, and most people use a tool that does it automatically for them.  </s>
<s> For anyone capable of writing such a tool, CSS-based layout is generally a lot simpler to build interfaces for.  </s>

<s> I'm also a developer, and I do this sort of thing almost daily as well.  </s>
<s> I find the opposite is true.  </s>
<s> CSS takes me less time than tables.  </s>
<s> I think it is a mixture of personal style, and the nature of the website you are doing.  </s>
<s> At UNITE, our perl seems to lend itself very easily to css layouts.  </s>
<s> It must be said, there is at least one table based layout I couldn't get to work in Netscape 4.7 using CSS.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'm a little unclear.  </s>
<s> When you use CSS for web pages, are you using a tool written in perl or are you hand coding the CSS?  </s>
<s> If you are using perl, I was wondering what your experience is with hand coding CSS?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott PS What does your perl tool do?  </s>
