<s> To conclude, i think it is useless and perhaps even a bad educational choice to present RDF, RDFS and OWL as 3 (or 3 + 2) different languages each of them to be used for a set of problem instead of one language (OWL) with a set of features each of them which can be used for a set of problem.  </s>
<s> Could all three be subsumed under one heading, e.g., W3C Semantic Web Language (SWL)?  </s>
<s> The basic message could then be: "there is one language, which offers different vocabularies and constructs depending on what you want to say".  </s>
<s> Rather than: "there are three or more languages and this is how they differ."  </s>

<s> actually, I think this is the right track -- to present it as one langauge overall - I'm not sure calling that langauge "OWL" is really right -- seems to me RDF is the right name -- that is RDF used in the "generic" sense the way "XML" is used to refer to XML, Xquery, XML Schema, ... - we will need to be clear when we mean RDF per se and  </s>

<s> is clearly an RDF document, but depending on what is in the "ex" namespace, this could use vocabulary from the RDF Schema and/or OWL vocabularies.  </s>

<s> is an RDF document, an RDFS document and an OWL (Full) document, even though it doesn't appear to use OWL vocabulary so I think a goal of the WORLD document (second document, aimed at Sem Web interested folks) will be to make clear the relations and to point out when there are semantic differences The semantic differences outside OWL DL and Lite are not that great, so this makes a good way to discuss what the two profiles of OWL are and what they contribute (I'll even hope someone who likes them write this section :- ) -JH Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> RDF has been around for longer and has better name recognition.  </s>
<s> Far better to say: "RDF is getting better, stretching its wings, etc" than to unintentionally imply that RDF is becoming obsolete (as in "Tired: RDF.  </s>
<s> Wired: OWL.").  </s>
