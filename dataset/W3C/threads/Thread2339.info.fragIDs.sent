<s> Some comments on the sticky headers draft:- 1) The asymmetry between the client/server responses may be due more to the current limited way in which HTTP is used than a feature of the problem itself.  </s>
<s> If we get servers which can implement the PUT and POST mechanisms then I think that the situation might well change.  </s>
<s> 2) I'm not sure of the amount that these proceedures buy us.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to have figures.  </s>
<s> Jim G. has made good points about the importance of getting as much usefull information in the first packet send out (i.e. before we hit the slow start throttle).  </s>
<s> This mechanism appears to be aimed more at increasing the efficiency of later packets.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the control data is not a substantial fraction of the total message size.  </s>
<s> It may be more effective to push on people to implement compression/decompression of message data rather than to worry overmuch on the size of the control data.  </s>
<s> Or at the very least point out this issue in the draft.  </s>
<s> 3) Section 2.2 asserts that proxies typically multiplex server connections across multiple clients.  </s>
<s> Is this in fact the case?  </s>
<s> What is the actual benefit of doing this?  </s>
<s> How often do two people from the same site wish to connect to the same remote site simultaneously?  </s>
<s> I am very skeptical about people having implemented such a feature in a multi-process server where the interprocess communication overhead would be very large for the payoff.  </s>
<s> Certainly the phrase "typical" does not seem appropriate.  </s>
<s> I could see it being possible in a single process, multi-thread server.  </s>
<s> I would like to see figures showing how often this case came up before compromising other optimisations to adapt to this complication.  </s>
<s> I point out this problem because much of the complication of the spec appears to be working arround this convergence of independent sessions into a single stream.  </s>
<s> On the other hand there may well be a number of proxies performing usefull work undoing the effects of simultaneous connections for image downloads.  </s>
<s> In this situation combining 4 streams from one anti-social browser into one is quite plausible, but note that in this case the headers will probably be compresssable!  </s>
<s> 4) The sticky header and possibly the connection header should be explicitly excluded from the set of sticky headers (!) 5) Section 6.  </s>
<s> This section should note that "replay attack" problem will always be present whenever the compression technique is possible.  </s>
<s> If an authentication technique authenticates the message itself then it will have to be a function of the message body and hence not "sticky-able".  </s>
<s> 6) Some mechanism for flushing the header cache would be usefull.  </s>
<s> This would help in the multiplexing proxy server case.  </s>
<s> After it is finished receiving input from one source the proxy can send a "flush" message and reset the stream.  </s>
<s> Overall I would like to see an awfull lot of numbers based on empirical measurement before deciding whether this is a worthwhile scheme or not.  </s>
<s> Although it looks OK to me I know from experience that without hard numbers it is very easy to overoptimise corner cases that almost never occur.  </s>

<s> Who cares if you get, say, 30% savings in web traffic on the LAN?  </s>
<s> In this game, it is backbone savings that count.  </s>
<s> Not everyone has a LAN link between user agent and proxy.  </s>
<s> Just to confirm this: we (at Digital's Palo Alto site) run the main proxy between the corporation (still almost 60K people) and the Internet.  </s>
<s> We have something over 100 Mbits/sec of bandwidth between our proxy and the Internet, but several orders of magnitude less bandwidth to most of our internal sites.  </s>
<s> In most cases, the RTTs between the proxy and the users are on the order of 100 msec or more.  </s>
<s> We have numerous users, unfortunately, who have internal connections at 56 kbits/sec and multi-hundred msec RTTs.  </s>
<s> Anything that saves lots of bits over these wires is Good.  </s>

<s> Some small number of people dial in to their proxy, which is owned by their service provider.  </s>

<s> where the effect of 304 (Not Modified) is not seen.  </s>
<s> (The low % in headers in your because the average response entity-body was ~10,000 bytes.  </s>
<s> In a 304 response, the entity-body size is 0, so the savings in request header size is more imprtant).  </s>
<s> I still have my original datasets, and just ran some new statistics on them.  </s>
<s> In proxy - outside server traffic, 200 responses made up 82% of all responses, and 304 responses 4%.  </s>
<s> Again, I was talking about user-agent to proxy traffic, and the 304s that would arise when the user-agent had something in its cache that it needed to revalidate.  </s>
<s> 3. It didn't consider asymmetric bandwidth situations.  </s>
<s> In the limit that the downstream connection is infinite in speed and with low latency, the savings of 80% in request header size that your study used would be significant.  </s>
<s> (The most likely early deployment of cable modems will use ordinary telephone lines as the request channel.  </s>
<s> And the modem hooked to the ordinary telephone line will probably do data compression, so you would gain little extra with sticky headers, I believe.  </s>
<s> In your model, a 200 byte request would be reduced by useing sticky headers to 40 bytes, and then the 40 bytes would be compressed to (say) 20 bytes (assuming a 2-1 compression ratio).  </s>
<s> Without sticky headers, and the same compression ratio, requests would be 100 bytes.  </s>
<s> The savings from sticky headers is still the same 80%.  </s>
<s> I think a new study would be needed to take these effects into account before we can conclude that sticky headers aren't worth the effrort.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> To get something like a firm conclusion, at least one other study is needed.  </s>
<s> My study was done a year ago, with a small sample (145 Mb of traffic), and by someone who is not a statistician.  </s>
<s> However, I think there is enough data to conclude that sticky headers are *unlikely* to be worth the effort.  </s>
<s> Seems to me that there is enough data to show that it won't help much in your environment.  </s>
<s> In other environments, it's at least not so clear-cut.  </s>
