W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA As discussed in last week's meeting we will limit the discussion of the guideline order to no more than 20 minutes. 
At the beginning of the discussion I will create a list of people who wish to speak on the issue. 
We will then limit each statement such that we have time for everyone's point of view and time for rebuttal and discussion. 
After 20 minutes we will either reach a resolution or vote. 
Could everyone please read all the list messages pertaining to the issue before the meeting. 
Thanks Jutta Can I call in 20 minutes after the meeting starts?

No. Because everyone has sent their response to the issues raised on the list as agreed at the last telecon it will actually only take 2 minutes... charles McCN Can I call in 20 minutes after the meeting starts?

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA I have been unsuccessful in managing my calendar and will be late again joining the call. 
It's a final review with the production folks making a CD-ROM that will, among other things, have a copy of the WCAG on it... Could the agenda be arranged somewhat to accommodate my late arrival? 
My proposal: Checkpoint 6.6 (Transformations) Checkpoint 6.3 (configurability) Guideline Order Last Call Regards, Phill Jenkins If we can address this in 2 minutes that would be wonderful. 
I will try to reduce the reiteration of previously stated arguments and perhaps we can significantly shorten the discussion. 
Jutta Phil, Yes we can adjust the agenda. 
I assume you wish to participate in the guideline order discussion and vote. 
Jutta
