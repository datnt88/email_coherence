<s> Bruce, Although I was not a fan of Microsoft Bob, I like the idea of using agent technology.  </s>
<s> To date, I have not really associated it in any way with Mr. Chips.  </s>
<s> Mr. Chips is just the name of a proposed support tool that might help page content authors consider the issues important to usability and education.  </s>
<s> I suppose that one approach would be to use the Microsoft Agent technology for this purpose.  </s>

<s> A few years back, Josh Krieger and I experimented with something we called conditional HTML.  </s>
<s> It allowed anyone visiting our test site to set a large number of personal preference then it would deliver a customized web page to the client's browser through a proxy server.  </s>
<s> We had settings for text color and size, background color, language, reading level, amount of media for supporting meaning, and more.  </s>
