Okay, I am (again) exhibiting boorish behavior by responding to my own posts, but I did some digging at the Microsoft site and found this URL about "Uncork the Power of Microsoft Agent 2.0": Chuck, does Mr. Chips tie into this technology at all? 
Anybody remember "Microsoft Bob"? 
Did anyone here try and use the interface for addressing cognitive disabilities? 
The most recent "news" I could find is almost two years old at URL: 
Bruce, Although I was not a fan of Microsoft Bob, I like the idea of using agent technology. 
To date, I have not really associated it in any way with Mr. Chips. 
Mr. Chips is just the name of a proposed support tool that might help page content authors consider the issues important to usability and education. 
I suppose that one approach would be to use the Microsoft Agent technology for this purpose. 
I think this extends beyond accessibility and I remain devoted to spending a bit more time on basic web access issues before moving too far along with Mr. Chips. 
A few years back, Josh Krieger and I experimented with something we called conditional HTML. 
It allowed anyone visiting our test site to set a large number of personal preference then it would deliver a customized web page to the client's browser through a proxy server. 
We had settings for text color and size, background color, language, reading level, amount of media for supporting meaning, and more. 
It seemed like a slippery slope. 
New technologies such as XML and CSS were just around the corner and we felt that they and additional browser capabilities would make it possible to accomplish the same goals once standards had been established. 
Now the problem is that web content needs to be broken up into definable objects, wrapped in meta data, and served as flexible and/or customizable content to a local client to meet a wide range of preferences and needs. 
We know how to do this now but it will still take a while for content developers to prepare media in a manner that makes this small vision of a malleable information and education environment possible.
