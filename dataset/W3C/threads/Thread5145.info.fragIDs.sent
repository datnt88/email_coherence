Greetings all, The SVG Working Group is pleased to announce the first release of the SVG Printing Requirements. 
It's worth reading if you are interested in using SVG in a print/publishing environment. 
We'd really like feedback on these requirements, so we've set up an email list specifically for such feedback. 
public-svg-print@w3.org Even if you don't think this is completely relevant to you, the use cases described in the document are interesting.

Dean, Just a quick procedural/bureaucracy question. 
In the "Status of this document" section ... which nobody else reads :) ... it says that the document will eventually be published as a W3C Note. 
Typically, Requirements documents in the recent past are just left as Working Drafts. 
Is targetting a Note a new W3C standard procedure? 
Or an SVG WG innovation?

Its an emerging w3c wide convention, to show that they are no longer being worked on.
