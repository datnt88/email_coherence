<s> I am unable to build Amaya 8.0 on SuSE Linux 8.1.  </s>
<s> My errors look different to those reported by Bodo v. Thadden.  </s>
<s> I downloaded amaya-src-8.0.tgz to a PC running SuSE Linux 8.1, read README.amaya, untarred amaya-src-8.0.tgz, created directory LINUX-ELF, cd'ed to LINUX-ELF, ran ../configure successfully, and then ran make which gave the the attached output.  </s>
<s> Do the Red Hat 8 rpm's work with SuSE 8.1?  </s>
