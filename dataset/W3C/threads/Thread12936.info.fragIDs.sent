<s> (attached is the same document in the html format) ?xml:namespace  </s>

<s> Also avoid the term "capital".  </s>
<s> We are talking of costs that might be of a "capital nature" that need to be incurred less often whose usefulness lasts for more than one accounting period, as well as costs that might be more repetitive.  </s>
<s> So it is inappropriate to use the term "investment".  </s>

<s> This is an accounting term and an accounting decision for an org.  </s>
<s> So let us keep it simple and just use "costs".  </s>
<s> NL 1.  </s>
<s> I am in full agreement with Sailesh regarding renaming the section.  </s>
<s> The best way to talk about the costs is in association with the benefits.  </s>
<s> We need to present a cost-benefit analysis that clearly demonstrates that the costs are the long-term investment and, in the long run, will be offset by the benefits.  </s>
<s> 2. Consider following introduction for this section of the doc: "It is important for an organization to recognize that making Web content accessible is not a one time effort and expense but needs long term commitment as Web content and Web applications undergo changes and revisions over time.  </s>
<s> Besides monetary costs, an organization needs to be prepared to invest the extra time needed for the effort especially during the initial stages, and also overcome any resistance to changing content development and deployment processes.  </s>
<s> " NL 2. I would mention long-term commitment in relationship to the ongoing costs but would not emphasize it in this section.  </s>
<s> I would not also talk about other challenges associated with the accessibility introduction (resistance etc.).  </s>
<s> Though, I think it is a valid point that should be mentioned somewhere else. 3. "The cost of including accessibility is usually a small percentage of the overall Web site development cost."  </s>
<s> Need to be careful here.  </s>
<s> (Natasha too sounded a warning on Oct 24 meeting) This might be true when a new website is being built with accessibility in mind.  </s>
<s> Retrofitting can be expensive, might need workflow / process changes / training etc and often fails to be prioritized as it may involve re-doing content and may be resisted.  </s>
<s> Also, what is "small"... can we indicate a range more objectively?  </s>
<s> Consider words like insignificant or negligible too.  </s>
<s> Argument can be stronger by relating incremental cost of accessibility not only to total Web content dev costs but to total expenses of running the org.  </s>
<s> NL 3. Fully agree that we should be very careful claiming that accessibility is a small percentage of the overall development and that "Most of the costs are early investments at an organization level".  </s>
<s> For large web sites, the initial investment can be really significant but for small and static web sites the cost can be minimal.  </s>
<s> I do not think that we can break it even by the size of the company because the size of the company does not imply that their web site is large and complex.  </s>
<s> Though we also need to take the size of the company into consideration.  </s>
<s> Maybe we can break it by two categories: one-time retrofitting costs (list all costs) and costs associated with the accessibility integration into the web development cycle.  </s>
<s> I would suggest to follow Sailesh advice and just list all the costs that the company can potentially incur as a result of their accessibility efforts (either one-time or long-term commitment) 4. Strongly feel that repeating "leads to cost savings later on" is not necessary in this section.  </s>
<s> The argument about someone going straight to this section can be made about any other section, so do they warrant similar inclusion of content from other sections?  </s>
<s> NL. 4. I feel that it would be beneficial to present the costs and benefits together.  </s>
<s> We need to think about the appropriate format 5. Consider replacing "costs are early investments at an organization level..." by saying : "Very little or nothing needs to be done to make an individual project accessible once the process of authoring(or building) accessible content has been internalized at the organizational level."  </s>
<s> NL 5. I would be happy if the above statement was true but with the current status of web technology it is not a true statement.  </s>
<s> Even with integration of accessibility into the web development process, the cost associated with the testing and selecting the right alt text or other alternatives is pretty high.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> Consider listing costs (non exhaustive): The costs most likely to be incurred for making Web content accessible might be attributable to the following: *Audit or evaluation of the state of accessibility of website and Web applications *Tools that allow authoring accessible content *Content management software that integrate accessibility design and development practices (The above two can be substituted with: Adopting processes / CMS that allow authoring accessible content; some might even integrate evaluation and repair capabilities) *Training staff to design and develop accessible Web content *Obtaining transcriptions, translations and captioning for multi media content *Automated tools for Web accessibility evaluation and repair *Quality assurance / testing processes to ensure Web accessibility *Assistive technologies normally used for computer access by people with disabilities.  </s>

<s> I fully support an idea of listing the costs.  </s>
<s> We can look at the implementation suite and list all the costs related to implementation starting from awareness campaign.  </s>
<s> But, again, there should be, at least two case-scenarios.  </s>
<s> One for a one-time web development and another one for integration accessibility into the development process 7. The following content also needs to be introduced into this section - preferably after listing the above cost elements.  </s>
