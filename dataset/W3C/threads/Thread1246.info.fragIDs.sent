<s> The IETF registration imposes one additional constraint: if there is no initial BOM then the byte-orientation must be big-endian.  </s>
<s> That is, in any stream that does not begin with the (hex) byte sequence 00 00 FE FF all of the bytes are interpreted as big-endian.  </s>
<s> Note: This is parallel to the IETF registration of UTF-16.  </s>
<s> As defined by the Unicode Standard Version 3.1, without a BOM the byte orientation of UTF-32 and UTF-16 could be either little-endian or big-endian.  </s>
<s> The choice of byte orientation would be determined by a higher-level protocol.  </s>
<s> The IETF registration is such a protocol, and constrains the byte orientation to be big-endian for determinant interpretation.  </s>
