this summarizes several open 1.1 issues and, imho, addresses some of the ambiguity in the current 1.1 statement. 
Personally I would prefer to not have the difference made between syndicated content and native content, but this is a summary of many issues and the 'ad content' issue was one of them. 
The syndicated content SC is derived from those issues. 
Guideline 1.1: All non-text content should have a textual alternative explicitly associated with it. 
Level1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1: 1. 
For content that is not syndicated from an outside source, e.g. ads, four conditions must be met: * For non-text 'resources' that have no direct bearing on the content being conveyed a text alternative must be provided with a null value. 
This will inform AT that this resource should be ignored. 
* For non-text 'resources' that have iconic or functional use a text alternative must be provided which details the function of the element. 
* For non-text 'resources' that encode specific information in a non-verbal form a text alternative must be provided which presents the encoded information verbally. 
* For non-text 'resources' which encode no specific information, but are intended to create a sensory experience, a text alternative must be provided. 
This text should convey what the resource is, and what relevance the resource has to the rest of the content if any. 2. Syndicated content must not: * Flash screen reader readable text or otherwise altering text stream * Spawn pop up windows * Steal or keep keyboard focus * Refresh content Level2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1: 1. 
All content including syndicated content must conform to level one conditions. 
Level3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1: 1. 
A text document is provided that includes all important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds. 
2. Textual alternatives should not require use of a particular sense to be understandable. 
If specific sensory data is referenced in the text, e.g. 'red' or 'alto', such a reference should not be essential to understanding the text. 
3. For time based resources a synchronized transcript is provided. 
We are going to need tighter phrasing than that. 
"Explicitly associated" could be interpreted to mean the addition of actual text on the page saying something like "Look at the bottom of the page for the description of this image," without a link. 
Sort of like people "marking" the language of text by writing "The following text is in Spanish." 
I've never been wild about the presumed synonym "programmatically," but it could work here.

Expect criticism if you top-post That's why I suggested earlier "explicitly associated in markup or a data model" to clarify the point. 
If the qualification is omitted, then it will need to be included in a definition of "explicit association". 
We could say that the association between a text equivalent/alternative and the corresponding non-text content can be programmatically determined. 
This is a very cumbersome form of expression however, which I would rather avoid. 
Any suggestions for better wording?
