I've been experiencing some oddness in Amaya on Win2k. 
The fuzzy problem is Amaya tends to render content very oddly, munging two pages together, or rendering the html as if it is missing chunks, but this might be a problem with the ssh or jigsaw proxy I'm using ... The more substantive problem is that Amaya for Windows has some built in paths (for the .ini 
file) that no longer hold on Win2K. 
User files are kept in \Document and Settings.

The best way to check that is to see the source view. 
If some content is within the source view but is not displayed in the formatted view, it could be either a Amaya bug or an error in the document structure. 
I met this kind of trouble when I dowloaded document with invalid height constraints. 
Could you check also that there no height attribute or a CSS constraint on the element. 
The more substantive I probably need to check that on a Win2K machine and adapt the code.

The source view is truncated as well.

I'm a consultant developing a web authoring tool for set-top box browsers. 
The first rev. 
however is supposed to run on WinNT/Win2K in MDI (Multiple Document Interface) style; that is, I have to look at more than one window at a time. 
Microsoft's solution DHTMLEdit just has too many bugs to be acceptable. 
I am currently building a layer over IE, but I would like to consider adapting the AMAYA code. 
I would like some advice. 
Thanks, Jack.

Amaya runs on WinnNT/Win2K but we didn't do any specific adpatation for the MDI (Multiple Document Interface). 
You have first to try Amaya in your environment then you can report us if you think that we can make some adaptation. 
Someone from the team or someone from the www-amaya-dev subscribers colud perhaps help you.
