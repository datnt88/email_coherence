Hello, The WAI Team discussed Triple-A Conformance of some pages and documents including WCAG 1.0. 
Checkpoint 14.2 reads: 14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page. 
[Priority 3] This seems to mean that an all-text document (or one with text almost exclusively such as the GL home page or the WCAG 1.0) cannot conform at Level Triple-A. 
I think we discuss this issue at a teleconference. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs 14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page. 
[Priority 3] IJ:: "This seems to mean that an all-text document...cannot conform at Level Triple-A." 
The decision as to what qualifies as "where they will facilitate" is an easy exit for this since so many on this list and IG have made it clear that in their humble opinions the addition of graphic or auditory presentations not only will not facilitate, but in fact inhibit comprehension. 
No matter how deplorable it may be that non-readers are shut out of access to text, until something more than "wouldn't it be nice if..." shows up, things like 14.2 can have no effect: i.e. *what* graphics, etc. will actually be useful? 
The problem of pinning down what colors are "effective" is a trivial problem compared to which illustrations are in fact illustrative and the color debate rages on. 
Triple-A in this case is in the mind of the author since the trial judge would be hard put to argue that the GL home page would demonstrably improve with the addition of illustrations in the face of opposing views claiming that they interfere with usability. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I think there is truth in the suggestion that an all-text document may not be completely accessible, if comprehension can be facilitated with non-textual illustration. 
Some concrete examples are the proposed SMIL accessibility note, which coul really use some flowchart diagrams. 
I am personally loath to claim anything as triple-A compliant unless I am very sure that it is clearly written, appropriately illustrated, and everything else has been exhaustively checked. 
This is the effect of 14.2 on me. 
Whether the "out" offered is easy or not depends on the context - this is about as it should be, in my humble opinion.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA CMcCN:: "provide photos of people using braille devices." 
WL: I can't believe that a photo of someone using a braille device would do anything beyond forcing more scrolls on the reader. 
How could this be of any use? 
The idea of SMIL examples is clearly valid but if we are discussing the pages about guideline efforts, the subject matter doesn't obviously cry out for their inclusion. 
Perhaps in the techniques/examples document but not on the WAI page. 
This is what you're going to run into when you attempt to decide what illustrations are appropriate, necessary, sufficient, etc. - a bunch of academics debating if a picture of someone reading braille improves understanding of textual materials' accessibility. 
IMHO this is "Red Herring #6754B". 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE It is precisely due to the ambiguous scope and nature of the requirement that checkpoint 14.2 bears a priority 3 rating. 
It was introduced in recognition of the value of multimedia content in facilitating comprehension. 
My interpretation would be that the author has a responsibility to determine whether adding auditory/visual content would significantly amplify or clarify the information conveyed in the text. 
I would argue that checkpoint 14.2 needs to be formulated more precisely, or to be supplemented by appropriate guidance in the techniques document, if its priority is ever to be increased.
