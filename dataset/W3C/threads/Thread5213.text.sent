Greetings, I've been trying to use the OWL-S API (http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/i 
ndex.shtml) to read in the composite service described by http://www.mindswap.o 
rg/2004/owl-s/1.0/BookPrice.owl 
The relevant Java code is: OWLSReader reader = OWLSFactory.createOWLSReader("1.0"); List servicesList = reader.readAll(new 
URI("http://www.mindswap.org/2004/ow 
l-s/1.0/BookPrice.owl")); 
The List that is returned only contains 3 elements, whereas I would've expected it to contain 4, one for each of: 1. http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/1.0/BookPrice.owl#BookPriceService 
(top-l evel composite process) 2. http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/1.0/CurrencyConverter.owl#CurrencyConvert erService (atomic subprocess) 3. http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/1.0/BookFinder.owl#BookFinderService (ato mic subprocess) 4. http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/1.0/BNPrice.owl#BNPriceService 
(atomic su bprocess) Only the atomic services (2-4) are returned, there is no record of the the top- level composite service "BookPriceService". 
One possible explanation for this is the data flow error indicated by the outpu t (see below). 
Ideally, I need access to the entire process model, beginning with the top-leve l process and the ability to track the data flow through same. 
Obviously this i s not possible if the top-level process is "missing". 
If anyone has any suggest ions about how I might do this, I'd be grateful if they'd pass them on. 
Also, a ny idea what the alleged problem with this service's data flow is? 
It looks fin e to me! 
The output generated by the code above is shown below: Start reading service: http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/1.0/BookPrice.owl#Boo

PriceService Best Wishes, Dï¿½nal [snip] Hey. 
There might be a delay in getting you an answer. 
All the mindswappers, including myself and the OWL-S API author are feverishly preparing for WWW (and various meetings). 
Mot of the OWL-S folks will be at WWW or the SWSI F2F. 
If you're going to be at these meetings, feel free to hunt us down :) But otherwise, we'll try to pop this from our stack next week. 
It does sound like there's a problem. 
You might try some other OWL-S descriptions to see if there are similar issues. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia. 
I think the problem is that the code is looking for "theProperty" instead of "theParameter". 
It does (see OWLSReader_1_0.java, line 249): stmt = value1.getProperty(OWLS_1_0.Process.theProperty); 
if(stmt.getObject() 
instanceof Resource) stmt is null, because there's no "theProperty" (only "theParameter"); then stmt.getObject() 
throws a null pointer exception. 
BTW, does anyone know what the licence terms are for the OWL-S API? -- Jeff [snip] We typically release things under MIT like licences. 
I'll nag Evren to put the licence notice on the code. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia. 
A further problem is that it looks for "atClass" instead of "atProcess".
