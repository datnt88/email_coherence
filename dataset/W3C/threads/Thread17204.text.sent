Now that the holiday season is upon us, could people please ensure that, if they generate Out of Office auto replies, they only send them to personal correspondents, not to people on public mailing lists. 
I've had my first one for Christmas from one persistent offender (ignores complaints about this) in the UK Cabinet Office. 
Some mailing lists with larger membership and a high proportion of business Windows users can effectively mailbomb contributors because of this problem (around 80 per posting for the NTBUGTRAQ list). 
As well as annoying contributors, these often leak confidential information. 
W3C lists use de facto standards to flag their articles as list articles, but my understanding is that Microsoft will not do anything to honour Precedence headers until they become de jure standards. 
As far as I can recall, what you say about Microsoft mail clients, in particular Outlook, is correct. 
I am afraid there is very little their users can do, save change mail client. 
May I suggest a mail filtering software that deletes "Out of Office" replies ? 
It is, so far, the only way I have been able to survive on public mailing lists. 
Happy [insert festive season of choice] to you all.

Yes... of all the lists I am on, this list is the worst for that infraction. 
They can set to nomail or unsubscribe. 
Were I running this list, anyone sending a vacation message would be unsubscribed.... Since it's Christmas, I might even send them a note telling them why. 
Your use of poorly designed software should not cause me to have to take steps to avoid being annoyed by it. 
TjL Hear, hear! 
Given that the ancient "vacation" program has got this right since before there was a WWW, it seems deeply wrong that anyone should be producing or using deeply defective software that can't cope with the simplest mailinglist protocols today. 
OTOH, it's a fairly minor nuisance compared to the sheer volume of Klez and similar stuff clogging up the 'net. 
Their track record suggests that de jure standards are unlikely to cut much ice, either. 
Nick Kew sure, then they will set "the standards" and to heck with organizations such as W3C.

Thanks Hi All Thank you David for this important reminder. 
snip snip When I worked for a major multinational, I saw the entire mail system "die" as the result of an auto-responder; one user had set up a "Reply to All" rule. 
The infinite loop caused major network disruption, not to mention major headaches for those of us who had angry users on the phone saying that their mail was not working. 
So, please folks, just un-subscribe if you really do have to use one of these beasts.
