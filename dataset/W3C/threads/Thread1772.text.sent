Hi, simple question: How is a MERGE of collection versions done? 
Is it just a proppatch to DAV:version-controlled-binding-set? 
Regards, Daniel The DAV:version-controlled-binding-set is a readonly property on a collection version. 
To merge a collection version: To merge members of the collection version CV1 into working collection WC2, you would checkout CV1 (to get WC1), MOVE the members of WC1 that you want into WC2, and then DELETE WC1. 
To merge members of the collection version CV1 into checked-out version-controlled collection, VC2, you would need to select particular versions of the version histories identified by the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of CV1, and then use VERSION-CONTROL requests to create version-controlled resources for those versions in VC2. 
Or if you are lucky, your server supports "auto-merge" for collections, and the server does this all for you.

This method applies if the server supports working resources / working collections, right? 
To merge members of the collection version CV1 into checked-out version-controlled collection, VC2, you would need to select particular versions of the version histories identified by the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of CV1, and then use VERSION-CONTROL requests to create version-controlled resources for those versions in VC2.

And this if it does not support this, right?
