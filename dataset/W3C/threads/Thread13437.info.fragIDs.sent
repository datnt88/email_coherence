<s> FYI The process that I usually use to quickly check out pages for accessibility is: 1. Look at the page in Opera w/images off.  </s>
<s> Opera easily allows me to switch back and forth between viewing images or not.  </s>
<s> Also, I use Opera to look at use of style sheets (again I can turn this on/off easily), pages without scripts (my default setting is to load scripts, but most scripts only sniff for Navigator and Explorer, therefore usually break on Opera which is always fun to see unless it crashes my machine which is fairly often), I don't have any plug-ins loaded for opera.  </s>

<s> 4. i always end up looking at the code because the visual appearance of pages is deceiving due to clever HTML tricks.  </s>

<s> Opera does indeed give a much better a pure text look than WAVE, and the toggling is very sweet.  </s>
<s> Do you think I should add a mode to WAVE that toggles the images?  </s>
<s> BTW, when you're running WAVE you can also look at the ALT tags for image maps areas...  </s>
<s> I don't think opera shows them, or at least I haven't been able to figure it out.  </s>
