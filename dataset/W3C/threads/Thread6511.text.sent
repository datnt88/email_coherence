Out of curiosity, how exactly is the XHTML validator getting past the homepage for W3C? 
The basic spec for XHTML should not allow it to validate the page for a number of reasons: Markup tags are in upper and lower case (consistancy). 
Attributes are not quoted (lots of them). 
Terminated elements are not adheared to (li tags). 
Non-Terminated empty tags are present (img, br and hr). 
Since I'm currently working on a lot of XML/XHTML and trying to get it all nailed down, I just thought it curious that the W3C's page doesn't conform and displays the "validated" tag at the bottom of the page. 
Am I missing something? 
Just think'n it's a little odd, Aaron W. Silver awsilver@renderology.com www.renderology.com 
Could you elaborate a little and give us example of these bugs? 
As far as I can see, the homepage doesn't have such issues. 
Could you attach the html file you get at www.w3.org? 
Thank you in advance for your help!

That's where the confusion came from.
