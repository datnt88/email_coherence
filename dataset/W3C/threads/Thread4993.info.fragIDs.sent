<s> Task An RDF/OWL ontology editing/browsing/displaying system uses a specialized GUI to display OWL/RDF ontologies.  </s>
<s> It uses RDF annotations to the OWL/RDF to record information relevant to its operation (such as screen coordinates, font styles, color) as part of the ontology, using a specialized set of property names all in a  </s>
<s> namespace reserved for use by the application.  </s>
<s> This enables it to use RDF/OWL tools and conventions to store an ontology during an extended  </s>
<s> work period.  </s>
<s> (We are designing such a system right now, called CODE, and it will do this.)  </s>
<s> The developer wishes to be able to detect when any such triples occur in an RDF graph, to extract them all when they do occur, and also to be able to extract all triples which do not use any name in this  </s>
<s> reserved namespace.  </s>
<s> To do this, a query which matches any triple with a property name in a set of namespaces would be a useful feature, for  </s>
<s> example in an ad-hoc notation: (?x {+ codelay: + cadegra: }?y ?z .)  </s>
<s> should match any triple whose property name is a URI in one of the  </s>
<s> namespaces indicated, while ({-codelay:}?x {+codelay:}?y  </s>
<s> ?z .) should match any triple whose property URI is in the codelay: namespace and whose subject is a URI not in that namespace.  </s>
<s> Actually this notation really is horrible, but I dont have time to think of a better one.  </s>
<s> We actually will have to be able to do this for CODE, and will implement it ourselves if we have to, but I think that being able to do name-space sensitive retrieval might be generally useful, eg so as to be able to easily detect if an RDF graph uses any OWL terminology.  </s>

<s> Are you refering to namespace prefixes here?  </s>
<s> How can one do this since (a) there are no qnames, nor namespaces, in RDF (regardless of what syntactic machinery might be employed in RDF/XML or any other serialization of an RDF graph) and (b) there is no reliable way to deduce any namespace prefix from an arbitrary URI.  </s>
<s> IMO, the use case as defined, in terms of an XML namespace name, is incoherent insofar as RDF is concerned.  </s>
<s> I think a more RDF-pure approach would be to define explicit vocabularies which indicate which terms and subvocabularies are part of such vocabularies, such that the URIs denoting the terms remain fully opaque.  </s>
<s> It also allows one to define functional or application specific vocabularies which include terms having disparate namespaces (or rather, URI) prefixes.  </s>
<s> This is how we manage vocabularies in Nokia.  </s>
<s> A vocabulary for defining such vocabularies is http://sw.nokia.com/VOC-1 and some examples of deployed vocabularies defined as such are sub-vocabularies) and e.g. a 3rd party definition for DC 1.1&amp;format=text/html You're query above, could be expressed as FIND all triples (?x ?y  </s>

<s> WHERE ?y  </s>
<s> voc:partOf codelay OR ?y  </s>
<s> voc:partOf cadgra I.e., presuming codelay and cadgra are rdf:type voc:Vocabulary and have their terms defined accordingly, then you simply want all triples where the predicate belongs to one of those vocabularies.  </s>
<s> With this approach, namespaces are *irrelevant*, as they should be given the principle of URI opacity.  </s>

<s> That's true from the query engines persepctive, but as the author of a query you can state that you are interested in URIs with a given prefix.  </s>
<s> Effectivly stating that it is a namespace.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Like I said in a subsequent posting, this then falls under the general use case of regular expression matching of node labels (which is firmly outside the scope of the RDF MT, albeit justified by what seems to be an agreed and desirable level of utility).  </s>
<s> Still, if the goal is to model vocabularies, then hacks based on looking into the lexical form of URIs are the wrong way to go, IMO. Patrick Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com  </s>
