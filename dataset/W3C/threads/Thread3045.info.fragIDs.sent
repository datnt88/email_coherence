<s> From: Rohit Khare[SMTP:khare@w3.org] From an architectural standpoint, I thought the issue instead was: What the !#$%@ are application-level authentication concepts doing in a transport-level confidentiality protocol?  </s>

<s> Personally, I consider authentication to be far too sensitive a task to trust to applications.  </s>
<s> (Then again, I also consider authorization to be far too sensitive a task to trust to applications; how many operating systems, after all, treat file access control as an application-level matter?)  </s>
<s> But  </s>
<s> regardless of where you think authentication should go, passphrase-based authentication should obviously be in the same place as public-key-based authentication, since they both perform the same function.  </s>
<s> As for authorization, the only people I can think of who are trying to slip authorization into TLS are pushing attribute certificates, not passphrase authentication.  </s>

<s> Hm, and why?  </s>
<s> If I play the role of an application programmer, I consider authentication to be far too sensitive a task to trust to the operating system or something similar (;-).  </s>
<s> Its all a question of standpoint.  </s>
<s> I'm not so sure.  </s>
<s> From the application programmer's standpoint, is file access control too sensitive a task to trust to the operating system?  </s>
<s> I can think of at least two good reasons for leaving file access control to the operating system: 1) Access permissions are normally independent of the application.  </s>
<s> If I want a certain file to be read only by certain people, then I don't care which application those people may be using; I simply want access denied them.  </s>
<s> It therefore makes sense to control access in a centralized way.  </s>
<s> 2) Access control being a sensitive matter, I would rather have the operating system try to implement it correctly once than rely on each application writer to do it correctly every single time.  </s>
<s> Eventually, after all, one of them is bound to get it wrong.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, both of these reasons apply equally to authentication (and the latter, at least, applies to authorization as well).  </s>
<s> Especially in the Web environment, the server needs to authenticate users, that might not necessarily be authenticated at the operating system level at all, at their system, and may only be authenticated at the application-level, considering the web-server an application.  </s>
<s> This is the only argument I've heard so far for leaving authorization in the hands of the application: operating systems have not (yet) stepped up to do the job.  </s>
<s> Now, that's a perfectly good argument for *letting* the application do authorization.  </s>
<s> But it seems like a very bad argument for *preventing* the OS (via TLS, perhaps, in the future) from doing a job that (in my view) it should be doing in the first place.  </s>
<s> You are an operating-systems person, aren't you :-).  </s>
<s> No, I'm just a cryptographer who spends far too much of his time naively berating operating systems people for not doing their job properly.  </s>
<s> But thanks for the compliment.  </s>
<s> :^)  </s>
<s> Of course it is the responsibility of the OS to protect the files, but isn't it the Web-Servers responsibility to protect the pages?  </s>
<s> If we assume a full integration of web-services into the OS, such that there no longer is a web-server per se, your wishes become true of course, and we only have to discuss/specify how a user on Unix authenticates himself to a MS-Windows-NT machine at the OS-level.  </s>
<s> Fine with me, but is this realistic for now?  </s>
<s> Is the TLS model unrealistic?  </s>
<s> Authentication of both clients and servers under TLS has already been implemented in several places in a manner which makes authentication pretty much invisible to the application.  </s>
<s> This is an important first step, in my view, towards wresting general authentication out of the hands of applications and placing it in the OS where it belongs.  </s>
<s> That more steps are necessary doesn't make this one any less welcome.  </s>
<s> Until then, I see that authorization needs to be done at the Server-level.  </s>
<s> And, if the server does not trust the OS, or TLS, authentication of the user needs to be done there too.  </s>
<s> I would prefer, for architectural reasons, to have a machine-level authentication of some sort at the transport level, and user-level authentication on the application level.  </s>
<s> I'm not familiar with these "architectural reasons".  </s>
<s> If the OS took care of both, why would that be an "architectural" problem?  </s>
