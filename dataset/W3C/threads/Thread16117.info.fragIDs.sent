<s> Part of my job duties involve supporting our employees who use assistive technology, notably screen readers.  </s>
<s> There is a new (federally sponsored) program to allow staff to participate in a online masters degree program at George Washington University.  </s>
<s> The problem is that GWU web site is a good model of inaccessible design.  </s>
<s> The "courseware" program is some customized application developed in house (at GWU) that requires a certain browser (for compatibility with poorly written JavaScript I believe).  </s>

<s> Despite my best efforts, he does not believe that a university's requirement for certain versions of certain software on the client end is unreasonable, or in violation of the WCAG.  </s>
<s> My needs (as I perceive them) are as follows: 1) What is the most succinct way to argue that requiring a certain browser IS in violation of the WCAG?  </s>
<s> 2) Can anyone refer me to university accredited on-line classes that are accessible with Lynx or pwWebSpeak?  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I will be trying to upgrade the software for the one user in question.  </s>
<s> (She is currently very happy with MS IE 3x and Artic WinVision.  </s>
<s> WinVision, however, is not currently compatible with IE 4x and Arctic makes no promises about compatibility with ANY versions of Netscape Navigator.) This will not help at all when it comes to the PDF files -- which are images of text -- access.adobe will be useless.  </s>
<s> I am advocating that, in the meantime, the user make extensive use of disabled student services.  </s>
<s> I am also (going through channels this time) trying to get this issue on the radar of appropriate folks at GWU. Anybody know the president there?  </s>
<s> grin We have a little time, the class does not actually start until the end of August.  </s>
<s> The courseware registration page is at: front door -- but it is not compatible with IE 3x nor Lynx (nor pwWebSpeak I would guess).  </s>

<s> April 20, 1999 Robert C. Maxson President California State University, Long Beach 1250 Bellflower Blvd Long Beach, CA 90840 (In reply, please refer to Docket Number 09-99-2041.) Dear President Maxson: On December 17, 1998, the U.S. Department of Education (Department), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), received a complaint alleging that the California State University, Long Beach (University) failed to provide a student with the accommodations required by her disability (blindness) in order to access the College of Business curriculum and other educational programs.  </s>
<s> OCR has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this complaint and over the University under both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities (Title II), which prohibit recipients of Department funds and/or public institutions, respectively, from discriminating against persons with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the complainant alleges that: 1) The computer laboratories/classes in the College of Business are not equipped with adaptive technology so that she can take courses such as Business and Information Systems, which is a prerequisite to her obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in her major Business Management.  </s>
<s> 2) Her course assigned textbooks, which contain substantial amounts of graphs and charts, were not made accessible to her.  </s>
<s> 3) With respect to a particular Business Management course, the instructor refused to provide her access to overhead transparencies and to implement the appropriate accommodations for the course's final examination.  </s>
<s> 4) The doors of the offices of the College instructors are not marked in a manner that enable her to identify the occupant instructor.  </s>
<s> Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II) requires a public college to take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with persons with disabilities "are as effective as communications with others" [28 C.F.R. ' 35.160(a)].  </s>
<s> OCR has repeatedly held that the terms "communication" in this context means the transfer of information, including (but not limited to) the verbal presentation of a lecturer, the printed text of a book, and the resources of the Internet.  </s>
<s> Title II further states that, in determining what type of auxiliary aid and service is necessary, a public college shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability [28 C.F.R. ' 35.160(b)(2)].  </s>
<s> In construing the conditions under which communication is "as effective as" that provided to nondisabled persons, on several occasions OCR has held that the three basic components of effectiveness are timeliness of delivery, accuracy of the translation, and provision in a manner and medium appropriate to the significance of the message and the abilities of the individual with the disability.  </s>
<s> The courts have held that a public entity violates its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act when it simply responds to individual requests for accommodation on an ad-hoc basis.  </s>
<s> A public entity has an affirmative duty to establish a comprehensive policy in compliance with Title II in advance of any request for auxiliary aids or services [see Tyler v. City of Manhattan, 857 F. Supp.  </s>
<s> 800 (D.Kan.  </s>
<s> 1994)].  </s>
<s> A recognized good practice in establishing such a comprehensive policy is to consult with the disability community, especially those members most likely to request accommodations.  </s>
<s> As universities have striven to provide effective communication to students with disabilities with respect to computer technology, traditionally the academic community has relied heavily on a single centralized unit on campus to house and maintain the specialized adaptive technology equipment.  </s>
<s> This practice has been seen as a method for enabling a small number of staff with adaptive technology expertise to serve a relatively large number of students with disabilities.  </s>
<s> However, such sole reliance upon a single centralized location (when not limited to adaptive technology training, but instead used for instructing disabled students in course subject matter) may run counter to the strong philosophy embodied in Title II and Section 504 regarding the importance of fully integrating students with disabilities into the mainstream educational program, unless such services cannot be otherwise effectively provided [see 34 C.F.R. ' 104.4(b)(iv); 28 C.F.R. ' 35.130(b)(iv)].  </s>
<s> Thus OCR assumes in most cases computer access will be effectively provided to the student with the disability in an educational setting with his or her nondisabled peers and classmates at the various computer laboratory sites scattered throughout the campus.  </s>
<s> In most OCR cases, at any point prior to completion of the investigative stage of the case, the college may indicate that it is interested in exploring voluntary resolution of the issues identified in the case.  </s>
<s> A commitment by the University to voluntarily resolve the issues usually substantially reduces the necessity for further investigation and may eliminate the need for OCR findings of compliance and/or noncompliance.  </s>
<s> In this case, the University elected to proceed toward voluntary resolution.  </s>
<s> By letter received April 1, 1999, the University provided OCR with a voluntary resolution plan which resolves the issues raised in this case.  </s>
<s> This plan includes the following commitments (as well as others): The University will: 1) Develop and implement a written procedure describing which campus units are responsible for installing and maintaining adaptive workstations situated in College and central computer laboratories.  </s>
<s> 2) Develop and implement a systematic method for ensuring that the issue of accessibility to persons with disabilities, particularly blind persons, is taken into account when colleges purchase computer technology (software and hardware).  </s>
<s> 3) Develop and implement a systematic method for informing campus employees who design/select web pages for use by students to make sure the web pages are in accordance with principles known to maximize accessibility to users with disabilities, including visual impairments.  </s>

<s> Your only sin is talking about something that is uncomfortable, like the kid who outed the emperor's new clothes.  </s>
<s> Don't diss the script writers.  </s>
<s> I hear consistently from independent sources that the Netscape dialect of JavaScript is much better for these purposes.  </s>
<s> The problem is that we laid this one between the lines.  </s>
<s> This does not violate the WCAG, per se.  </s>
<s> It violates the whole point of the WCAG, which is technical checks which will ensure that you don't need to standardize the client.  </s>
<s> The explicit WCAG violations are at a lower level; such as all those pages that don't work with scripts turned off.  </s>
<s> That is a clear chapter and verse violation.  </s>
<s> However, this is not the argument that your UberBoss needs to hear.  </s>
<s> He needs to understand the actual problem.  </s>
<s> The actual problem is that for the blind user, the browser is not the user interface, the screen reader is.  </s>
<s> And while WIMP browsers are interchangeable with minor annoyance, screen readers are a whole different kettle of fish.  </s>
<s> Learning the screen reader User Interface is a major cognitive investment and it doesn't work if you can't do it by heart.  </s>
<s> You can't just slide over to the screen reader that happens to work with browser X and keep working.  </s>
<s> That is why it is essential for this class of disabled users that the content be standardized in a client-neutral way at the browser input.  </s>
<s> We never laid that out in detail because as the W3C it is indelicate for us to name names of products of members.  </s>
<s> And to talk about the lack of mix-and-match at the browser-screen-reader interface one would have to name names of browser products from W3C members.  </s>
<s> So the browser-neutral principle is in the assumptions, not the letter, of the WCAG.  </s>
<s> Hi Bruce, We develop, maintain, and instruct several accredited online courses at the University of New Brunswick.  </s>

<s> To produce web content which requires a particular browser (does not transform gracefully across platforms) is a violation of one of the basic principles of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> It sounds like particular violations in this case include checkpoints 6.3 and 11.4 (both priority 1, and 11.4 is the "at last resort" checkpoint), and probably a number of others.  </s>
<s> The rest of the problem is a one which, in Australia I would take up as a discrimination complaint - and the letter posted about such a complaint under US law would be a beter guide to the situation that my own knowledge (although professional advice would of course be better again, and is strongly encouraged).  </s>
