The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.1a Beta version of the Amaya editor/browser. 
This release includes the first Alpha public version for PC/Windows. 
You can find enclosed here below a more complete list of the new features of this version. 
This list is also available on-line at: The source code for the Amaya 1.1a Beta release release is available at: This release has also been precompiled for a number of Unix patforms. 
You can download the precompiled binary distribution by following the instructions given at: New features in Amaya 1.1a Extensions: * Anchors and ID attributes: + When Amaya parses a document it verifies that all MAPs have a different NAME value and changes them if not. 
The USEMAP attribute of the related IMG element is also updated. 
+ The function "Create Target" generates automatically a NAME or a ID attribute according with the current selection. 
- If the DTD allows the insertion of an anchor as the parent of the current selection, Amaya inserts the anchor and takes the first included word of more than 3 characters as value of the NAME attribute. 
- If only one structured element is selected (DIV, H1, etc.), Amaya generates an ID attribute for this structured element. 
The ID value as the NAME value depends on the included text. 
Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is unique. 
If it's not the case it changes the value by adding a counter at the end of the word still it's not unique (example "value1" if "value" already exists). 
+ When an anchor with a NAME attribute or an element with an ID attribute is pasted, Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is unique and changes its value if not. 
+ Functions which create a MAP element generates automatically a NAME with the NAME value "map". 
Amaya checks that the new NAME value is unique. 
+ When an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is pasted, Amaya remove this attribute. 
and when an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is deleted, Amaya does take care of the related MAP element. 
The document author has in charge to delete this MAP or relink it to another IMG element. 
* Links: + The functions "Create Link" or "Change Link" create an anchor if the DTD allows the insertion of an anchor as the parent of the current selection. 
Then the user can click on a target anchor or a target document or a structured element with an ID attribute. 
- If it's not a valid target, Amaya displays a form to insert the HREF value. 
- If the user click on a valid target, Amaya generates automatically the HREF value. 
In both cases, Amaya transforms the HREF value to make it relative to the document base (the BASE element value or the current document URL). 
+ When an anchor with a HREF attribute is pasted, Amaya transforms the HREF value to make it relative to the document base. 
* Images: + The function "Create Image" creates the SRC value relatively to the document base (the BASE element value or the current document URL). 
Amaya also creates the ALT attribute and initializes its value with the image name. 
+ When IMG is pasted, Amaya transforms the SRC value to make it relative to the document base. 
* Publishing: + Button "Copy Images" indicates that images have to be copied into: - the new document directory (on the remote server or locally), - the new image directory, if there is a specified image directory. 
+ Button "Transform URLs" indicates that all URLs, SRCs are recomputed when saving the document. 
In both cases, Amaya generates relative URLs when it's possible. 
* Customization: Each user can define his personal file HTML.conf in his HOME directory. 
So each individual user can now customize size and position of Amaya windows. 
* Java: Upgraded to Kaffe-0.9.1 using the JDK 1.1.2 classes. 
The mechanism to access Java objects content has been cleaned up and should be ready for 64 bit targets. 
Java stubs are not distributed anymore, the Makefiles produced by autoconf build them on the fly to avoid conflict in case of changes in the HTML schemas. 
General improvements for the Java classes embedding access to the document C objects. 
* Math: This version of Amaya contains an embryonic MathML editor, that allows mathematical expressions to be embedded in HTML pages. 
It implements a subset of the MathML specification. 
This feature should be considered as a demonstration, as it is very imcomplete. 
More in next releases. 
* MS/Windows This is the first version of amaya that runs on Microsoft Windows (both Windows 95 and Windows/NT). 
Fixed bugs: * Spaces were not accepted in end tags. 
For instance, /STRONG  was considered invalid. 
It is accepted now. 
* Amaya refused to create an Image before an Image. 
Now it works. 
* Sometimes, active zones were not created. 
* Using Style forms, the text was displayed correctly, but the style attribute registered the previous style value instead of the new one.

Under Windows 95, Amaya 1.1a runs very slowly with frequent pauses for several seconds during which it will not update the screen or respond to the mouse. 
It also does not load pages from the Web (no error message occurs, it just silently fails) although it does load files from the local hard drive. 
Under Linux 2.0.30 (RedHat 4.2), on trying to access a page from the Web, Amaya 1.1a either segfaults or exits with the message "Thot tool kit error: invalid parameter" repeated twice. 
The previous version (1.0b) worked fine.

Hi, You did release the binary of the 1.0b version for sparc-linux.

Sorry, but don't plan to release sparc-linux version. 
That takes too much time. 
Regards Irene.
