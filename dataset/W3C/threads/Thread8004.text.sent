Good Morning Folks, I have been attempting to get IE5 to talk to our apache 1.3.14 server using the mod_dav module. 
Having played around extensively I cannot, for the life of me, get IE5 talking to the server. 
It appears that I need to install Frontpage extensions. 
In reading the archives of this list, I can't see anywhere that this gets a mention as being a requirement. 
My understanding of IE5 Web Folders was that it was fairly compliant and did not require extensions. 
Am I barking up the wrong tree? 
If this is not the right list for these comments, can somebody please point me in the right direction?

The dav-dev@lyra.org mailing list is the right place. 
See: For the information that we'll need to diagnose your problem, then post to the dav-dev list. 
Cheers, -g ps. w3c-dist-auth is generally "implementation agnostic" and is about the protocol itself.

I don't have any problems with web folders, Office 2000, IE5, or DreamWeaver, but FrontPage, Visual InterDev, and VS.NET don't do WebDAV.

(So does my product, Xythos WebFile Server, on apache or off). 
The trick may be that you've got to set up a web folder: IE 5.5 doesn't know that it's talking to a WebDAV server unless you tell it. 
Depending on the OS, this is done by creating a new network place in "my network places" or a new web folder in "Web Folders". 
We've got instructions on www.sharemation.com 
to help people do this. 
Frontpage extensions are irrelevant.
