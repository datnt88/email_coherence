Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility: Business Plan Appendix X 5. Set milestones Suggestion for wording: This policy applies to [this organization's] all areas of this organization's internal and external Web sites, with priority to high traffic areas of the site {and areas of special relevance to disabled 
persons}; 
however, all areas of the site are expected to conform to [specify conformance level] by [second date].

Hi Andrew, 
I only disagree on the part "{and areas of special relevance to disabled persons}". 
It might lead to suggest that is OK to assume what areas are 
"of special interest" for disabled persons.

Thanks Carlos, Wasn't sure about that clause - thought it might be controversial, but there are special circumstances where subsites _are_ of specific interest to 
(some) disabled persons. 
Eg. physical/public access instructions; discounts 
that apply; transport issues; audio-loops in buildings; sub-titles on films/tv-shows; etc Andrew 
Me too. 
Especially in a document highlighting the advantages to *everyone* of these proposals. 
The overall goal is inclusion so that we can gain the benefits therefrom - all of us, not just "special" folks. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Hello, I agree with Andrew. 
The contexte is milestone for implement accessibility policy. 
It is realistic for a large website to have priorities in the process of becoming accessible. 
I agree with Judy not to presume of person with disability interests but when a content is clearly targeting these peoples, i think it is reasonable and correct to include it explicitly in the priorities.
