At the Interop working group meeting several months ago, the consensus of those attendees was that servers should be more strongly encouraged to consistently end collection URLs with trailing slashes (TS). 
Presumably this would replace some instances of SHOULD with MUST etc. 
Today however, a different group of WG attendees came to the opposite conclusion: that servers aren't going to get better at this (they already have their reasons if they're not using TS consistently, e.g. performance concerns of finding out if an internal resource is a collection). 
If servers won't get any better, then it's more pragmatic to encourage clients to check for the TS all the time. 
Under this view, clients should be easily capable of examining the TS before concatenating the name of a new resource they're about to create. 
Resource type is the correct way to determine whether a resource is a collection. 
There is some fallout if we move to the model of saying that it doesn't matter whether the server uses a TS ending or not. 
For example, if a client creates a collection without a TS, and the server prefers to use TS the server should respond with Content-Location and the "normal" name for the collection. 
Also, vice versa. 
This means that the client knows what to expect if it then does a PROPFIND on the resource. 
In other words, this puts the onus for handling TS on the client. 
I'd like to see some discussion if people have anything to add, or summary of advantages &amp; such. 
I'm thinking probably a straw poll shortly if Jim concurs. 
Lisa What is a resource type? 
....Roy p.s. it is impossible to reach WG consensus at a face-to-face meeting, even a regular one. 
Can someone tell me how to get off this list? 
I've tried a couple of times. 
I'm sure you are all fine people, but this is not information I need. 
Thanks for your kind help and generosity.

The concept defined by RFC2518, section 13.9. 
Specifically, a resource with type DAV:collection is a WebDAV (something where when you apply PROPFIND depth 1, internal members are going to be enumerated). 
So do you have any guidance how a working group is supposed to resolve open issues, if not by face-to-face and on-the-mailing list discussions? 
Then the issue should state that, not "resource type". 
It has to be something that the server has specifically told the client. 
We discuss them in both places (and in the hallways), and only poll for consensus on the mailing list. 
Otherwise, you'll just piss off the people who don't have enough money to attend F2F meetings.

Lisa was very careful to state that it was meeting attendees, not the WG, reaching consensus. 
- Jim people I think this is what we are doing. 
for To be clear, we do poll for consensus in person, but that's a common IETF practice (sometimes implemented as a hum in large meetings). 
We have always brought in-person discussions and "conclusions" (to avoid the word "decisions" to the list for finality. 
That's why I mentioned having a straw poll on the list shortly if discussion points that way.
