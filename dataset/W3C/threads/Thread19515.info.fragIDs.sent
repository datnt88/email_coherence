<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Not true.  </s>
<s> Amaya installer shows you the directory in which the directory root of the Amaya tree will be installed and you are free to modify it.  </s>
<s> The root directory in Amaya in Thot.  </s>
<s> if, for instance, you shose C:\Programs Files, Amaya will be intalled in C:\Program Files\Thot.  </s>
<s> This is not typical to Amaya, but always the case for any program.  </s>
<s> Here you are in right place.  </s>
<s> Please send your bug reports to www-amaya@w3.org  </s>

<s> No, this C:\Program Files is ok.  </s>
<s> You will find it creates one subdirectory and everything goes to that subdir.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it is remarkable that the dir is named 'thod' with amaya being a subdirectory thereof.  </s>
<s> This is due to the fact that Amaya is based on Thod.  </s>
<s> If this Thod is expected to be used for other applications as well, the Amaya installation should install the Amaya specific stuff in an own directory (C:\Program Files\Amaya by default) and store Thod in it's own directory (C:\Program Files\Thod by default).  </s>
<s> In this case, Amaya distributions should come without thot distributions too.  </s>
<s> There is no need to update to the same Thod version if there is a new Amaya version.  </s>
<s> If this Thod is to be used by Amaya only, the install tree should be reversed: Amaya containting a Thod subdirectory.  </s>
