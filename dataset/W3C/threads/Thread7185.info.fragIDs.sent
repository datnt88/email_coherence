<s> Here are my comments about section 4. 4., first paragraph: "We define the most common forms of reference syntax in this specification because they impact and depend upon the design of the generic syntax, requiring a uniform parsing algorithm in order to be interpreted consistently."  </s>
<s> This seems to just say "We are writing this chapter because we are writing this spec."  </s>
<s> Also, the 'because'-'requiring'-'in order' cascade is long and confusing.  </s>
<s> Better things to say would be: - These are defined so that other specifications can easily reference them.  </s>
<s> - We define these to help the reader understand the spec.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of new terms in this section.  </s>
<s> It is not always clear what exactly is a term.  </s>
<s> It would be better to use some clear convention when a term is introduced, e.g. quotes.  </s>
<s> Throughout the whole section: There should be an example for each term.  </s>
<s> 4.1, 'validating parser': People familiar with XML might think they understand what we mean here by 'validating parser' and 'non-validating parser'.  </s>
<s> But there are other readers, so we better define clearly what we mean here, or use other wording.  </s>
<s> Also, in various discussions about the use of URIs, I have heard people explain that any application should only check URIs as far as necessary, and pass things on even if they do not completely conform to the syntax.  </s>
<s> Larry e.g. brought this up in the context of the anyURI type in XML Schema.  </s>
<s> This should be said explicitly.  </s>
<s> 4.2 'network-path reference': is the full term just 'network-path reference', or is it 'relative network-path reference'?  </s>
<s> Same for the other two terms.  </s>
<s> 4.5 'rather than machine' - 'rather than machines' or 'rather than for machines' or 'rather than for machine interpretation'.  </s>
<s> 4.5 "It should be noted that such heuristics may change over time, particularly when new URI schemes are introduced."  </s>
<s> change, e.g. to "It should be noted that such heuristics may change over time, particularly if a new URI scheme should become popular."  </s>
<s> it's really not the introduction, but the popularity, which makes the difference.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
