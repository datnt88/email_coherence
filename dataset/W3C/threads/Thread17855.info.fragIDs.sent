Per my action of the 10 April face-to-face meeting [1], here is a proposal to clarify checkpoint 9.2 (issue 208). 
The Working Group felt that this checkpoint was intended to allow configuration of prompting (like all the other checkpoints), but the wording did not capture that. 
Here is a proposed clarification: 
9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly, 
that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit form submit control. 
When configured to do so, prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly, that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit form submit control.

Please submit the entire sentence. 
I have had a very difficult time expressing all the pieces in one simple sentence.

How about: Checkpoint 9.2 Allow the user to configure the user agent to prompt the user before the user agent submits a form, unless the submission was the direct result of an explicit user activation of a form submit control. 
This sounds more like the wording used in other checkpoints: 2.2, many checkpoints in guideline 4...

My problem is that the word "user" appears five times in the sentence. 
I don't find this expression of the requirement any clearer. 
I have found this checkpoint requirement difficult to express in very very short language.

Checkpoint 9.2 Allow for configuration of the user agent for prompting the user before submision of a form, unless the submission was the direct result of an explicit user activation of a form submit control. 
Allow the user agent to be configured so that when a form is submitted other than by an explicit activation of a form submit control, the user is prompted to confirm the submission.

That almost works for me. 
Let me try one more round: Allow configuration so that when a form is submitted other than by explicit user activation of a form submit control, the user is prompted to confirm the submission.

One more try by me: Allow user configuration for a conformation prompt before a form is submitted, except when the user explicitly activates a form submit control. 
The reason I suggest this is that the requirement is not broken up with the exception. 
The exception follows.

Very nice. 
How about: Allow configuration to prompt the user prior to a form submission, except when the user has explicitly activated a form submit control.

One other question: it may sound like you have to allow for configuration except when the user has explicitly activated a form. 
How about: Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit activation of a form submit control.

Ian, I actually think the next to last version was clearer. 
Quote Allow user configuration for a confirmation prompt before a form is submitted, except when the user explicitly activates a form submit control. 
unquote Just my opinion, otherwise it sounds like the configuration will be prompting rather than the system prompting for confirmation.
