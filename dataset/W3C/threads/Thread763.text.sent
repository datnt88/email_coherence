Your second was pure HTML.) -- Dave Try this, (1) the style tags are not correctly indented (using -i).

Thanks, R. Keir //and more ............................................................ Also Does (or can) summary get auto-inserted, as in table summary=" " so when you get reminded that you forgot the summary, you can just fill in the space. 
Then there is height, width, as in img height=" " width=" " to stop moving text when you first visit a web site, (but if it starts a argument again, disregard this idea) From Eric DISCLAIMER OK I can take a hint!, if there is no feedback I will assume that this is a stupid suggestion and promptly forget who wrote this. 
or !- ... - to insert line numbers, but they get I can't comment on your other issues, but constructs like !123 and !-123- are not legal comments in standard HTML. 
Try !--123-- . 
Perhaps Tidy should convert things like !123 and !-123- into legal comments instead of discarding them. 
However, despite the optimistic subject of this thread :), it's not as simple as it seems. 
--Randy There is an explicit check for the STYLE and SCRIPT start tags in "pprint.c" 
at line 1243 that prevents indenting of these elements. 
I suspect that the reason is this note in the HTML 4.01 Specification (Section 6.2, CDATA): Although the STYLE and SCRIPT elements use CDATA for their data model, for these elements, CDATA must be handled differently by user agents. 
Markup and entities must be treated as raw text and passed to the application as is. 
I would surmise that this might be to avoid turning a style rule such as: P { font-family: "Times New Roman", serif } into: P { font-family: "Times New Roman", serif } ...when indenting. 
Please give an example of what you mean. 
If I have this line in a file to be tidied: ...I get this warning from Tidy: line 16 column 1 - Warning: p unknown attribute value "fizzle" Is this not what you want? 
I don't understand your reference to list separators. 
Can you give an example? 
I'm not convinced that auto-insertion of required or recommended attributes is good. 
Tidy flags a missing TABLE summary attribute with this comment: "The table summary attribute should be used to describe the table structure. 
It is very helpful for people using non-visual browsers." 
Auto-inserting a meaningless (null) attribute would then suppress the warning, and the value might never be filled in. 
I suspect Dave Raggett might agree, given the very strong warning associated with the "alt-text" option description on the HTML Tidy home page. 
A better approach, rather than auto-inserting dummy attribute values, might be to have an option to suppress accessibility warnings. 
This would have the advantage that the suppression could be turned off. 
Conversely, once null attribute values were inserted, Tidy would be unable to generate accessibility warnings thereafter. 
The HTML 4.01 DTD contains this comment on the LENGTH entity (used to specify the values of the width and height attributes): "nn for pixels or nn% for percentage length" Therefore, it appears to me that a null width or height would be invalid, and Tidy should not generate invalid markup, even as a temporary measure (i.e., even subject to further author editing). 
Moreover, I don't believe that this will do what you want, as the text "moves" because the user agent doesn't know the size of the image until it's retrieved. 
Specifying a null width and height still won't give the browser the information needed to reserve space for the image in the layout. 
-- Dave Bryan Hi, I'm working with the Java version of Tidy. 
Giving, as input of Tidy, HTML files with syntax errors (like non-closed tags, or " " inside attribute values), makes Tidy generate an error and the abort of creation of the "tidied" file (the output file is empty). 
Does anyone know how to let Tidy skip syntax errors in HTML code and always generate an output file (without tags that caused errors, for example)? 
Thanks. 
Aldo Benzoni Well, it's not what he's *asking* for, which would be more like Warning: p unknown value "fizzle" for attribute "align" And I think I agree, even though the bad value would usually be enough to identify the problem. 
Consider for example Ah, I understand now. 
Thanks for the clarification.
