<s> Review of: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1999-02-26 As there are currently lots of W3C documents requiring review by the I18N IG and we have three of our own WDs under development, I have reviewed this document myself.  </s>
<s> I am copying the I18N IG, in case any members wish to supplement, or take issue with, my comments.  </s>
<s> A lot of thought has clearly  </s>
<s> been put into this document, so most of my comments are stylistic.  </s>
<s> 1. Abstract  </s>
<s> Suggestion: "automobile-based PC's" - "automobile-based PCs" 2. Guideline 2 Suggestion: "to understanding what's going on" - "to enable the user to understand what's going on"  </s>
<s> 3. Checkpoint 5.6 Suggestion: "use 'em' or percentages lengths" - "use 'em' or percentage lengths"  </s>
<s> 4. Guideline 6 I'm baffled by the title: "Supplement markup to aid interpretation of text" In what sense do any of the recommendations under this guideline supplement markup?  </s>
<s> 5. Guideline 6 checkpoints Suggestion: In addition to HTML's "lang" attribute, mention XML's "xml:lang" attribute.  </s>
<s> 6. Checkpoint 9.1 Suggestion: "in HTTP, auto-refreshing is done with "HTTP-EQUIV=refresh"." - "in HTML, auto-refreshing is done with "HTTP-EQUIV=refresh"." The current text is incorrect.  </s>
<s> 7. Checkpoint 11.1 This is surely incorrect: "See also guideline 11."  </s>
<s> 8. Guideline 12 Suggestion: "These activate elements are therefore difficult ... to access." - "These active elements are therefore difficult ... to access." 9. Note to Guideline 13 Suggestion: "the translation process" - "the conversion process" Suggestion: "If a page does not readily translate" - "If a page does not readily convert" The word "translation" is best reserved for use with human language variants of a document.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 13.5 Suggestion: "can not" - "cannot"  </s>
<s> 11. Checkpoint 15.9 Context: "Facilitate off-line browsing by creating a single downloadable file for documents that exist as a series of separate pages.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] For example, in HTML use the LINK element.  </s>
<s> Or create an archive of the different pages (e.g., with zip, gzip, stuffit, etc.)."  </s>
<s> I'm baffled by the sentence "For example, in HTML use the LINK element."  </s>
<s> It would appear that two distinct issues have got collapsed into one.  </s>
<s> 12. Checkpoint 16.3 Suggestion: "Create a consistent style of presentation between pages." - "Create a consistent style of presentation across pages."  </s>
<s> Note: The current usage sounds strange to me, but may be correct in US English.  </s>
<s> 13. Appendix B Suggestion: "Validate pages and assess the accessibility with automated tools" - "Validate pages and assess their accessibility with automated tools" 14.  </s>
<s> Appendix B, bullet 6 Suggestion: "Use a several browsers, old and new." - "Use several browsers, old and new." 15.  </s>
<s> Appendix C, DHTML Suggestion: "Most guidelines may be applicable to DHTML-type of applications" - "Most guidelines may be applicable to applications using DHTML" 16. Appendix C, PDA Suggestion: "devices.  </s>
<s> usually" - "devices, usually"  </s>
<s> 17. References Suggestion: Change all W3C references to point to the "latest version" of each document, eg: "http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424" - "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"  </s>
<s> The current references make it less likely that checkpoint 13.1 will be adhered to.  </s>
<s> 18. General Suggestion:  </s>
<s> &amp;nbsp; span class="priority1" [Priority&amp;nbsp;1] /span " - span class="priority1" [Priority&amp;nbsp;1] /span "  </s>
<s> Ditto for the other priorities.  </s>
<s> The current extensive use of "&amp;nbsp;" results in unnnecessary formatting anomalies.  </s>

<s> Misha, Thank you for your prompt review.  </s>
<s> The editors will take into account your comments.  </s>
<s> I've snipped the purely editorial ones from my comments below.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be better to say something like "Provide clues about natural language information".  </s>
<s> And in the subhead (or rationale) explain that such markup will help, for example, speech synthesizers.  </s>
<s> Yes, I believe it should be Guideline 10.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> There are trwo problems in the example part of 15.9: a) The LINK element should be mentioned in a checkpoint about navigation tools (that may be synthesized by UAs).  </s>
<s> b) The part about archives is another solution that is not related to the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> This has to be cleared up.  </s>
<s> Hmm, I recently changed them to designate specific versions intentionally.  </s>
<s> Perhaps unlike a technical specification, it's best in this case to point to the latest version.  </s>
<s> And 13.1 reinforces that.  </s>
<s> &amp;nbsp; span class="priority1" [Priority&amp;nbsp;1] /span " - span class="priority1" [Priority&amp;nbsp;1] /span "  </s>
<s> Good catch.  </s>
<s> Our scripts were producing an extra &amp;nbsp; at the beginning of that markup.  </s>
<s> The one between "Priority" and "1" is left intentionally.  </s>
<s> Thank you again Misha, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> Garbled attempt to say "supplement the text content with metadata in the markup."  </s>
<s> "Supplement markup" is, strictly speaking, wrong.  </s>
<s> Careful speakers of  </s>
<s> English will, as Misha did, interpret this as implying "do something that  </s>
<s> is outside the markup."  </s>
<s> Perhaps "augment" or "enhance" may have been intended, but a more straightforward statement would be to use apply, employ, or provide as in "Provide markup that aids conversion to speech and Braille."  </s>
<s> Or "Use markup that documents language and pronunciation."  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Again, Misha's wording is better.  </s>
<s> Al PS: Not Americanism, just Constructivism.  </s>
<s> [The degree of] consistency between pages is the inverse of [the degree of] difference between pages.  </s>
<s> Talking about consistency "between" pages presumes that the consistency relation is a binary relation and is applied pairwise to all possible pairs in the page set at the site.  </s>
<s> "Across" neatly avoids the issue of whether consistency is a pair or set property by allowing for both interpretations, whichever the reader is prone to assume.  </s>
<s> This choice also avoids getting entangled in the number connotations of "between" or "among."  </s>
<s> element."  </s>
<s> Sorry. Point a) -- there is in the HTML specification a remark suggesting that LINK markup be used to annotate the structure of a super-document tree composed of multiple HTML elements/files.  </s>
<s> That is why LINK is mentioned here.  </s>
<s> This is a pretty academic point, however.  </s>
<s> Perhaps in the _techniques_ for this guideline, we can refer the reader to a tool that walks the LINKs and merges the document in a print-to-file pass.  </s>
<s> Point b) -- The .zip solution is related in that it facilitates review while the user is not paying connect time charges.  </s>
<s> Admittedly it is an alternative to the literal satisfaction of the guideline as presently stated.  </s>
<s> But it is a technique addressing some of the same problems.  </s>
<s> To create a guideline that fits both techniques, one could perhaps broaden it to: "Facilitate offline reading of the material at a time and in a tool of the user's choice."  </s>
<s> Technique 1: Composite document in plain text file.  </s>

<s> Hi, I would like to comment on section 3.8 of the Web Content guidelines, at: In this section you discuss guidelines for applets.  </s>
<s> The subsection titled "Directly accessible applets" provides two links for more information on the topic (to "[JAVAACCESS]", a Trace website, and "[IBMJAVA]" an IBM website), but does not itself contain any language directing users on what techniques to use to create these accessible applets.  </s>
<s> I think this subsection should be amended to specifically include the key language on the topic, and refer to external web pages for readers to get more detailed information and guidelines (e.g. the IBM page, and of course the two pages on the Sun web site, 'www.sun.com/access' and 'java.sun.com/products/jfc').  </s>
<s> Specifically, I think this subsection should include language along the lines of: "To create an accessible applet, you must ensure that the applet supports the Java Accessibility API [link here to http://java.sun.com/products/jfc]  </s>
<s> This API is built into the Java Foundation Classes from Sun Microsystems, and can also be implemented directly by applets that aren't created using the Java Foundation Classes.  </s>
<s> Therefore, applet developers should either build their applets using the Java Foundation Classes, or otherwise implement the Java Accessibility API on their own.  </s>
<s> For more information about accessible applets..." Also, please consisder including an example Java applet which is accessible (or at least a link to one).  </s>
<s> The "SwingApplet" example that comes with the Swing package is just such an applet (a minimal accessible applet) I've attached source to SwingApplet, as well as a web page that invokes it using the Java Plugin (which is necessary for accessibility support until browsers support JDK 1.2 directly).  </s>
<s> Thanks, Peter Korn Assistive Technology Architect, Sun Microsystems  </s>
<s> Hello Misha, To address this we've adopted the following solution [1] a) Add a link from checkpoint 13.1 ("Use the latest W3C specs") to the references section of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> b) In the references section, add a statement about where to find the current versions of W3C specs and a link to the TR page.  </s>
<s> c) The list of references will contain dated versions so that readers will know what existed when the guidelines were created.  </s>
<s> d) To each entry in the list, add a link to the latest version of that spec.  </s>
