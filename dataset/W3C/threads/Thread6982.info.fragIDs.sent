<s> I have recently spent a considerable amount of time studying the URI spec [1]http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt and I discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that it defines the terms "URI reference" and "absolute URI" very precisely, but (a) it doesn't define the term "URI", syntactically (!!!) and (b) it doesn't give a term for an absolute-URI-with-optional-fragment-id , i.e. the result of combining a URI reference with an absolute URI.  </s>
<s> This is pretty awkward, since an absolute-URI-with-optional-fragment-id is really what we meant when we wrote "URI reference" in: "An XML namespace is a collection of names, identified by a URI reference" -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/#sec-intro  </s>
<s> We used "URI reference" because "absolute URI" excludes fragment identifiers, and we wanted to be a valid namespace identifier.  </s>
<s> But ../xyz/ isn't a namespace identifier, until you combine it with a base absoluteURI.  </s>
<s> Another example: "The locator attribute provides a URI-reference that identifies a remote resource (or sub-resource)" -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xlink-19991220/#Local Resources for an Extended Link URI-references don't identify remote resources; absoluteURIs do.  </s>
<s> The "or sub-resource" makes it clear that the author intends to allow #fragids.  </s>
<s> So again, what's needed is a term for absolute-URI-with-optional-fragment-id.  </s>
<s> It was called fragmentaddress in RFC1630.  </s>
<s> If formal systems float your boat, you can take a look at my formalism of this stuff in larch: nasty hacks for math symbols) version) part of "Specifying Web Architecture with Larch" which gives pointers explaining larch etc.  </s>
<s> I used the term URIwf for absolute-URI-with-optional-fragment-id, and I used absoluteURI and URI_reference with their rfc2396 meanings.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly  </s>
<s> Another closely related topic is the way the XML specs use the term "URI" when they actually mean "a Unicode string that's converted to a URI by escaping."  </s>

<s> Dan Connolly  </s>
<s> I like to think of relative URIs as a simple model based compression mechanism which doesn't affect the semantics of the identifier; changing the relative or the base part has the same effect as changing the resulting absolute URI.  </s>
<s> It should therefore always be possible to use a relative URI wherever you can use an absolute URI ("absolute-URI-with-optional-fragment-id") in which case URI-reference is the correct construction to use.  </s>
<s> Section 5.1 in RFC 2396 gives some mechanisms for finding a base URI but others may be devised.  </s>
<s> There is semantically no difference between a relative URI that can not be resolved because the base can't be determined and some URI you don't know how to resolve (for example foo:...) Henrik Frystyk Nielsen,  </s>
