Hi, I've just started using Amaya. 
Mosaic has pretty much gone the way of the dinosaur. 
But I am having a few problems with Amaya. 
I hope this is the place to mail it. 
Well, here goes. 
1. 
I thought that amaya uses the libwww5.0 library. 
If this is true, doesn't this library support persistant store cache? 
When I run amaya, it doesn't seem to be cache'ing anything. 
When I double click to go to another page, and press the array on the tool bar to return, the original page is reloaded, as if it was the first time viewing that page. 
All the images are retransfered. 
Note the other link did not purge the cache, because it doesn't include any large images. 
So is there a cache for amaya? 
It can't be used as much of a web viewer without one. 
2. Since amaya behaves like an editor, how does one use an image-map? 
I tried double clicking on the map, but nothing happens. 
How do I follow a link embedded inside a map? 3. I noticed amaya doesn't have a history list. 
Even word for windows has a recently opened docs list. 
Any good editor should have one. 
Could be useful for the viewer as well. 
4. I also noticed the arrow buttons on the tool bar behaves like a circular list. 
I don't think that is how it should be. 
Maybe I'm just using it wrong? 
Which leads to number 5... 5. 
Where can I get some docs on how to use amaya as a web viewer? 
I already checked out the documentation page on the amaya home-page. 
It had some basic commands, but nothing useful for heavy viewing usage. 
I don't need publishing instructions, just something to help me get the same features out of amaya that other browsers have. 
Any info you can send my way is greatly appreciated.

The libwww5.0 cache doesn't work well. 
Normally it works. 
Sometimes the trouble comes when the map is included in a and Amaya cannot overlaps the image with the map. 
Amaya has the basic set to develop a history list, but we are working on new developments and nobody here can spend time to work on this feature. 
It uses only the basic set of history list. 
I'm not sure we can write a tutorial.

Is this basic set the feature that allows you to make your own menu items? 
If not, where can I get docs for this basic set?

Hi Jimen, In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 18 Feb 1997 10:17:26 -1000." 
There is no doc for this basic set. 
But you can read the source code amaya/HTMLhistory.c 
(228 lines long).
