<s> Do you think they are equal or unequal?  </s>
<s> Those two files are clearly distinguishable, hence they are not equal.  </s>
<s> Personally, I would say they are equal as RDF graphs, and unequal as text documents.  </s>
<s> "as RDF graphs"...  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you mean by that, formally.  </s>
<s> I don't think you mean that N-triples file are RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> I think you mean that there's a straightforward correspondence from N-triples files to RDF graphs, and that the two distinct N-triples files above correspond to the same RDF graph.  </s>
<s> Jeremy's talking about *syntactic* equality (ie, "X equals Y" means "every expression involving X can be rewritten with Y substituted for it  </s>
<s> and the expression's value is preserved"), not identity (X and Y can be  </s>
<s> equal but not identical; if X and Y are identical then they're equal).  </s>
<s> This terminology is used (in my experience) by some mathematicians but  </s>
<s> not all; depends on the field and personal choice.  </s>
<s> In the sense it's used it's ok (I think) so it comes down to choosing a terminology and sticking to it.  </s>
<s> If this is going to cause wide-scale confusion it might be better to revert to couching this in terms of "isomorphism" which is a less overloaded term.  </s>

<s> Hmm... I wasn't familiar with that idea before... I'll have to think it over.  </s>
<s> But my intuition says the difference between syntactic equality and identity matters to the RDF spec.  </s>
<s> For example, if X and Y are distinct graphs that art syntactically equal, what's the cardinality of the set {X, Y}?  </s>
<s> It's 2, right?  </s>
<s> The model theory spec does stuff like putting graphs into sets, and I think it matters what the cardinality of the resulting set is; if X and Y are the graphs arising from the n-triples document jeremy gave as an example, I think the model theory spec depends on the cardinality of {X, Y} being 1.  </s>

<s> It could be that it doesn't matter.  </s>
