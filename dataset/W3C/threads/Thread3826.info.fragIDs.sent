<s> I finished the release for check v0.6.5 this morning.  </s>
<s> Apparently  </s>
<s> everything went well, and we're being put on the W3C Homepage as I write this.  </s>
<s> So kudos and thanks for the great work, I am incredibly pleased with our progress.  </s>
<s> Just after that I discussed with Systeam and we finally decided to proceed with the hardware switch for validator.w3.org.  </s>
<s> There again, all seems well, but should anything horrible (or just annoying) happen while I'm away (I'll be traveling in the next few days), please contact either Dom or sysreq@ so that they can fix, or revert to the old server.  </s>
<s> Thanks olivier  </s>
<s> *applause*  </s>
<s> But could we please use misc/mkrelease.sh  </s>
<s> for creating the release tarballs?  </s>
<s> It cleans up extra files, fixes permissions and modes inside the tarballs, and creates the (versioned) directory structure that most of the world uses, and which the RPM spec file expects (-- the RPM build is broken at the moment).  </s>
<s> Usage: $ mkdir foo $ cd foo $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public export -r validator-0_6_5 validator $ cd validator $ misc/mkrelease.sh  </s>
<s> 0.6.5 $ ls *.tar.gz sgml-lib-0_6_5.tar.gz validator-0_6_5.tar.gz  </s>
<s> I would appreciate it if the release tarballs currently at v.w.o would be replaced with ones created by this script.  </s>
<s> Oh, didn't know we had a specific script.  </s>
<s> scripts++.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
