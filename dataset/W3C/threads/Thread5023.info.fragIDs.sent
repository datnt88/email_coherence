<s> Here is your borderline case, and may help to explain the context of my earlier remarks.  </s>
<s> We wrote a paper that got accepted last year's ISWC conference that used DAML+OIL.  </s>
<s> The application had little if anything specifically to do with the Web, we just used DAML+OIL because it was an emerging standard ontology representation language, and we had a classification problem that was amenable to DL reasoning.  </s>

<s> My co-authors over-ruled my concerns and I was proved wrong.  </s>
<s> The paper got accepted and I gave the talk to a room that was 80-100% full of people.  </s>
<s> The predominant situation does indeed seem to be that it if you use DAML+OIL (or OWL) then it must be relevant to the Semantic Web (or at least, be of interest to the Semantic Web community).  </s>
<s> Work on this project continues, and if we ever make it a Web application, that will be independent from our choice to use DAML+OIL/OWL.  </s>

<s> Your paper may well have been accepted (as were many other at last year's conference) if you'd used a non-web ontology langauge -- it wasn't accepted because you used D+O (as evidenced by the many rejected papers that did as well) -- but what is of interest to the RESEARCH community is highly different than the mission of a W3C Working Group that is aimed at "Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment" In fact, I would point to the following in the charter (a document that I sometimes wonder if everyone in the WG has read) Research topics are out of scope.  </s>

<s> My co-authors over-ruled my concerns and I was proved wrong.  </s>
<s> The paper got accepted and I gave the talk to a room that was 80-100% full of people.  </s>
<s> The predominant situation does indeed seem to be that it if you use DAML+OIL (or OWL) then it must be relevant to the Semantic Web (or at least, be of interest to the Semantic Web community).  </s>
<s> Work on this project continues, and if we ever make it a Web application, that will be independent from our choice to use DAML+OIL/OWL.  </s>
<s> So, I guess we are not using any of the webby portions of OWL, and to date have not seen a need to (as far as I understand the webby vs. non-webby portions of OWL).  </s>
<s> See: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/ISWC2003/UCDF03a.html  </s>
<s> All The question of the role of classification/reasoning keeps coming up in various guises, so I suggest a new thread.  </s>
<s> As somebody who sees classification as essential, I have strong views on where it is necessary, where it is unnecessary, and where it is inappropriate.  </s>
<s> Short message: A) Authors need classification to author large multiaxial rich ontologies reliably and completely; Distributed collaborative authorship within a community - the natural mode for many web applications - particularly need classification to maintain integrity and detect conflicts.  </s>
<s> B) Most users will take the outcome of the authoring process including classification, but will not need to do further classification.  </s>
<s> "Users" in this case include annotators - mechanical or human - of Web resources that use ontology as a source of vocabulary.  </s>
<s> C) Hence most ontologies actually published for use will be pre-classified.  </s>
<s> D) Ontologies which are work in progress amongst authors will be at a variety of stages of classifications E) An additional consequence of the above is that we need metadata in the ontology to record whether it has been, is intended to be but has not yet been, or is not intended to be classified (and if so with which classifier).  </s>
<s> In more detail... A) When I am creating a classification I want to use classification to manage that process.  </s>
<s> I simply do not believe the task of building large multiaxial ontologies consistently is possible without mechanical checking of some sort.  </s>
<s> For most use cases, classification is at least an important part of the appropriate mechanical checking.  </s>
<s> Even for cases of a mere thousand or so terms, we have good examples of ontologies which were built in weeks with the help of classification which had failed to be built over years without.  </s>
<s> B) When I am using an ontology there are two cases; B1) It is possible to pre-enumerate the concepts that users require..  </s>
<s> In this case, once the ontology is classified, the users need know nothing except that they can rely on it.  </s>
<s> Users can be delivered a pre-classified verified ontology.  </s>
<s> This is how we have worked for most applications.  </s>
<s> Essentially we use the classifier to help us define a "Pre-coordinated" "phrase book" which is what is used in annotation.  </s>
<s> I presume this will be the dominant mode of use in the current phase of the development of the SW. B2) It is not possible to pre-enumerate the concepts/classes that users require.  </s>
<s> IE Users potentially require any of a combinatorially large number of concepts that might be defined based on the axioms in the ontology.  </s>
<s> However, we cannot predict in advance which concepts users will need.  </s>
<s> Were we to pre-enumerate all of them, the ontology would be absurdly, perhaps even indefinitely, large.  </s>
<s> Some form-generation and data-entry tasks fall into this category.  </s>
<s> I have not seen a SW application built this way, but I can well imagine a desire to annotate things richly enough that it would be impossible to pre-enumerate all the concepts required any more than it is possible to pre-enumerate all possible noun phrases in English relevant to a given topic.  </s>
<s> In these cases, users need to be given the facility to define new concepts consistent with the ontology and have them classified and placed in it correctly and the other consequences inferred.  </s>
<s> (This does not mean that users have to write in OWL or know anything about OWL, but that one output of the user interface would be concepts defined in OWL, which could then be classified, and that classification might influence the further behaviour of the user interface.)  </s>
<s> In this case we using the ontology as a "dictionary and a grammar" to drive a "post co-ordinated" application.  </s>
<s> How useful such applications will be in the context of the Semantic Web remains to be seen.  </s>

<s> 5) Jim's comment that he can't see what one would use OWL for outside the SW context is a bit hard to reconcile with an article of which he is co-author and which he cites as a major demonstration of OWL - in the very first SW Journal - on the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus/Ontology.  </s>
<s> If you look at the NCI's CaCore web site [1], it would be difficult to argue that their prime goal was the Semantic Web - nor does the article concern primarily Semantic Web issues.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see from the outside, NCI have published in OWL because it is a standard with tools to make their ontology widely available.  </s>
<s> Their internal work is in a different formalism (Apelon's) and has nothing to do in that form with the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> Many others will probably do likewise.  </s>
<s> Alan this is silly - that article is not at all about the Ontology per se, it is completely about how the ontology was ported to OWL so that it could be used on the semantic web -- the article is 100% about the semantic web issue.  </s>
<s> There's a long article being prepared for a bioinformatics journal about the ontology itself, and I would not claim that that article is relevant to this WG since it is about the ontology, but not about the ontology in the SW context.  </s>
<s> I'd like to make a request to you folks -- if you want to claim my own articles against may, I'd hope you will read them first.  </s>
<s> Further, almost be definition, the fact these are appearing in journals makes then much more likely to be "research" and thus out of scope I freely admit that many of my own papers and those by my students[1] are either not related to the goals of this WG or are research articles that are out of scope.  </s>
