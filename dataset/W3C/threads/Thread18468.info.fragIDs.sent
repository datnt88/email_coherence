This includes a requirement for the unprocessed source. 
I am arguing that that is not necessary at a P1 level - if we want it as a requirement we should make it seperate, and P2. 
Here's my reasoning why I think it's important to move the source view (or similar) requirement up to the checkpoint level. 
While this may seem like a new requirement, it is, in my 
opinion, an old, buried requirement. 
We require that all content be available through the user 
interface. 
We have also said that, because some users may not be able to access content when that content has 
been processed according to specification 
(e.g., scripts or style sheets), we require them to have access to the raw, unprocessed content. 
I think that we mean more than "a source view is probably a good idea as a last ditch solution". 
I think that we have meant: the user *must* be able to look at the source in case of emergency. 
I don't think that requiring a source view formally is a heavy burden since all user agents I am aware of do this anyway.

Charles and Ian, We may be able to say something like this in Ian's proposal: NEW 2.1 2.1 Make all content available through the user interface. 
Provide access to the unprocessed source information in addition to other views. 
[P1] Note: Users must have access to the entire document object through the user interface, including recognized equivalents, attributes, style sheets, etc. 
This checkpoint does not require that all content be available in every viewport. 
Access to the source information is an important part of a solution for providing access to content, but is not a sufficient solution on its own for all content. 
See guideline 5 for more information about programmatic access to content. 
/NEW 2.1 This implies a source view, but allows the developer other options.

This is two seperate requirements. 
In the past, (e.g. at the Princeton face to face meeting) I have argued that a source view is not actually necessary. 
Earlier versions of Amaya did not make the source available, although they did provide a structured view of the entire document object, and I believe that this would have satisfied the actual requirement. 
So I propose the following text: MyNew2.1 2.1 Make all content available through the user interface. 
[P1] Note: The user must have access to the entire document object (including recognized equivalents, attributes, style sheets, etc.) through the user interface. 
This allows the user to view content (markup, style sheets, scripts, etc.) after it has been processed. 
A document source view alone does not satisfy this checkpoint. 
This checkpoint does not require that all content be available in every viewport. 
See guideline 5 for more information about programmatic access to content. 
/MyNew2.1 
Essentially I have cut the requirement to have a source view per se - it is a useful technique and should be included in the techniques. 
But if there is access already to the document object, a source view is not actually necessary, so shouldn't be required by a checkpoint. 
Nor is it sufficient to meet the checkpoint (which the checkpoint already says). 
cheers Charles McCN Hello, Per my action item from the 30 November 2000 teleconference [1], please consider this proposed change to checkpoint 2.1 to resolve "I feel the description of 2.1 is too vague on exactly what portions of the content are satisfied by providing a document source view. 
You say it's good enough for some things, but not everything, and give a few examples but no clear guidance on how to extrapolate to other cases."

/OLD 2.1 Comments and observations: 1) If a document source view alone is not a sufficient solution, then Notepad cannot conform to UAAG 1.0. 
(In any case, whether Notepad can conform at P2 depends on whether plain text meets the requirements of checkpoint 6.2.). 
I will assume for the moment that we don't want a user agent that consists only of a source view to conform. 
2) I think that 2.1 needs to state clearly that: a) Most content will be used as rendered according to specification. 
This means that in general, users will not read CSS style sheets or scripts, but will experience their effects after processing. 
b) 2.1 also requires a source view for viewing unprocessed content, because there are cases where that is the only way for the user to get information. 
3) It is possible to claim conformance for a user agent that doesn't feature a source view in conjunction with Notepad. 
[I don't mean to pick on Notepad grin - I mean any source-viewing tool here.] 
There is no requirement in UAAG 1.0 that the two pieces of software must be "integrated" to satisfy the requirements of the document. 
So, I propose making the document source view requirement more explicit in the checkpoint: - Ian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0364 [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#394 [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20001229/ W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053, Australia until 6 January 2001 at: W3C INRIA, 2004 Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France

I agree with Ian. 
I think that we should have a specific requirement for access to the document source. 
While a document source view is the most common practice of providing access to the source, I think the concept of a 
document source view is to provide access to the source information. 
If 
there are other ways to do this than a text editor view we can put them in the techniques document. 
Charles would you be willing to submit a technique on how Amaya provides a document source view?

Amaya provides a source view like other editors do. 
But it also provides access to the document object. 
It processes some information (what it can handle) to render it in a formatted way. 
For the entire source it attempts to construct a tree of elements, which lists all the attributes that each element has in the source. 
It is possible to use a menu to get the value of any attribute on any element, in any view. 
I will try to do this for ATAG anyway, so when I have the technique I will share it. 
(I am trying to use http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources to describe the ways there are available for sharing techniqes across documents, as well as describing how ATAG is created...) cheers chaals I agree with Ian.
