<s> I agree, the normative wording seems to be insufficient, and not consistent with the rationale given just before it.  </s>
<s> In section 14.9.5 (No-Transform Directive), the rationale says: Serious operational problems occur, however, when these transformations are applied to entity bodies intended for certain kinds of applications.  </s>
<s> For example, applications for medical imaging, scientific data analysis and those using end-to-end authentication, all depend on receiving an entity body that is bit for bit identical to the original entity-body.  </s>

<s> Content-Type For example, this means that a response that looks like this HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: image/gif cache-control: no-transform could be modified so that the image is still a GIF file, but has had 99% of its bits removed.  </s>
<s> Not really consistent with the "bit for bit identical" criterion in the rationale!  </s>
<s> My recollection is that we fully intended "no-transform" to prevent such transformations, as well as the ones currently specified.  </s>
<s> Someone (maybe me) must have screwed up when it came to writing the normative wording.  </s>

<s> If I remove it, I run the risk of breaking an application.  </s>
<s> Gaaack.  </s>
<s> Content-MD5 can't be changed or generated by proxies.  </s>
<s> But there is no prohibition that a response with a Content-MD5 header has to be forwarded without transformation.  </s>
<s> I.e., the spec allows a proxy to transform a message with a Content-MD5 header in such a way that the Content-MD5 value no longer matches the contents.  </s>
<s> One might argue that this is OK. I.e., if the Content-MD5 is wrong, then the recipient can assume that the message has been transformed (making a Warning superfluous).  </s>
<s> One might argue that a response with both "no-transform" and a Content-MD5 shouldn't be transformed in such a way as to change the MD5 hash of the body.  </s>
<s> We could add a normative MUST NOT along these lines (say, to the definition of "no-transform", section 14.9.5):  </s>
<s> If a message contains the no-transform directive and also includes a Content-MD5 header, an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change the value of the message body.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, one could make a minor modification to the existing text: Therefore, if a message includes the no-transform directive, an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change those headers that are listed in section 13.5.2 as being subject to the no-transform directive.  </s>
<s> This implies that the cache or proxy MUST NOT change any aspect of the entity-body that is specified by these headers, [or by the Content-MD5 header field, if present].  </s>
<s> This means that one way to prevent a transformation would be to attach a Content-MD5 header field to the message.  </s>
<s> However, the computational cost of doing this, while not excessive, is not negligible, and so it's kind of a kludge.  </s>
<s> Another alternative would be to say: Therefore, if a message includes the no-transform directive, an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change those headers that are listed in section 13.5.2 as being subject to the no-transform directive.  </s>
<s> This implies that the cache or proxy MUST NOT change any aspect of the entity-body that is specified by these headers, including the value of the entity-body itself.  </s>
<s> which is what intuition suggests that "no-transform" ought to mean, and probably what we really meant to write.  </s>
<s> Note that the utility of Content-MD5 is perhaps suspect, since it applies to the message and not to the underlying thing.  </s>
<s> So it totally breaks down when trying to reassemble something at an intermediate proxy cache out of byte-range responses, for example, or from the proposed delta-encoded responses.  </s>
<s> Which is why some of us have proposed adding headers for "instance digests": In order for HTTP/1.1 proxies to "do the right thing" if this kind of extension is adopted later, the meaning of "no-transform" ought to be independent of whether or not the proxy knows that a set of header names is somehow special.  </s>
<s> Based on that, I would say that we should adopt the final correction that I proposed; not only is it the most intuitive interpretation of "no-transform", but it's also the most extensible.  </s>
<s> 2. This would lead me to think that I should add a "Warning: 214" even if I do not change the Content-Type or Content-Encoding (and that perhaps the spec should be changed to require this).  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> I think the specification here should be changed from 214 Transformation applied MUST be added by an intermediate cache or proxy if it applies any transformation changing the content-coding (as specified in the Content-Encoding header) or media-type (as specified in the Content- Type header) of the response, unless this Warning code already appears in the response.  </s>
<s> to 214 Transformation applied MUST be added by an intermediate cache or proxy if it applies any transformation changing the content-coding (as specified in the Content-Encoding header) or media-type (as specified in the Content-Type header), or the entity-body of the response, unless this Warning code already appears in the response.  </s>
<s> since otherwise there is no way to know if a proxy has, for example, removed 99% of the bits from a GIF file.  </s>

<s> On the topic of what to do with Content-MD5, you pointed out (around last December I think) that one use is to detect packet-splicing errors on ATM links (where the TCP ones-complement checksum is not sufficient).  </s>
<s> This, combined with the transformation issue, leads me to think that there could (or ought to) be a distinction between hop-by-hop and end-to-end message integrity checks (MICs).  </s>

<s> On the topic of what to do with Content-MD5, you pointed out (around last December I think) that one use is to detect packet-splicing errors on ATM links (where the TCP ones-complement checksum is not sufficient).  </s>
<s> This is a slight misinterpretation of what I wrote, if you're referring to: The main point of this message was that transport-level checksums do not necessarily provide an "error-free transport layer", and so higher-level checksums are useful.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the [Content-]MD5 checksum covers just the message body, and so if one is reassembling a document from several messages (e.g., using Range retrievals) one can still have undetected errors.  </s>
<s> This is why I speculated that Content-MD5 is "not even particularly useful" ... it's end-to-end as far as the HTTP messages go, but it's not end-to-end as far as the actual documents (or whatever) are concerned.  </s>
<s> I.e., I still believe that Content-MD5 is not actually the right solution for the problem.  </s>

<s> The so-called "End-to-End Argument" (see "End-To-End Arguments in System Design", J.H. Saltzer, D.P.Reed, D.D.Clark, ACM TOCS, Vol 2, Number 4, November 1984, pp 277-288.  </s>
<s> - probably not available online, alas!) implies that if you care about end-to-end integrity, then you need an end-to-end MIC.  </s>
<s> All you can get from hop-by-hop MICs is some added efficiency if (1) you have the ability to do automatic hop-by-hop retransmissions if the MIC detects and error, and (2) such errors are relatively frequent, or (3) the hop-by-hop MIC is specifically suited to the kinds of errors seen on that hop.  </s>
<s> But none of these conditions seems to be true for HTTP.  </s>
<s> (The Ethernet CRC is useful because Ethernet-level errors are common, due to CSMA/CD, and the CRC is designed for the kinds of errors that do occur.)  </s>
<s> In any case, it's hard to think of a way to specify "no-transform" in such a way that it depends on the presence of specific kinds of headers carrying MICs, especially if we want to be able to extend the set of MICs in the future.  </s>
<s> I think this is a rathole, and we're best off just saying "no-transform means no transforms of the entity-body, period."  </s>
