Hi all, 
Does anyone know of a course offered at an educational establishment that covers Web accessibility issues and how to overcome them? 
I am particularly interested in UK-based courses, unless there are distance learning ones available to UK residents. 
The reason that I ask is that there does not appear to be any way in which I can prove my knowledge prior to taking on a project, and also I would like to learn in a more structured way. 
I am aware of the course offered through WebAIM, but this is not affiliated to a degree or similar. 
I've done a search and found that York University offers something, but it is not quite what I require as they tend to be leaning towards developers rather than general interest such as I have - I mean, I can code a bit, but not to a level required to do it full time without having to catch up in a big way. 
If there are courses aimed at developers only, I am still interested; it would just mean that I would have to ultimately learn about two subjects concurrently and I am sure that the male species is not good at multitasking (at least that is what the TV adverts suggest) *grin* Thanks in advance

Simon the IWA/HWG do an online one run by Kynn Bartlett. 
I can thoroughly recommend it but not sure about accreditation. 
As far as Uni courses go I 
think they are pretty thin on the ground. 
I was told by a person from the Government's E-Envoy Office that they had looked at this and the inclusion of accessibility on web design/development courses was worringly low. 
A colleague of mine is doing a course at Sheffield Uni and is trying to get the tutors to include accessibility in next years syllabus. 
btw the bit about not being able to mutli-task is an urban myth. 
I am quite succesfully, at this very moment, getting paid for doing a job, drinking a cup of tea *and* answering a completley non-work related post to a public mailing list ;-) (and last time I looked I was male!) Julian

As I would hope computing departments at higher educational institutions across the world do, Dundee University's Applied Computing undergraduate and postgraduate courses include a strong emphasis on accessible and usable design of software, including web sites, and we encourage student projects in that area. 
But we don't offer a specific Accessible Web Design course. 
Simon, can I ask whether your request is as a result of a need to prove to potential clients a professional or academic qualification in accessible design, or is the enquiry more from the aim of validating a CV or resume? 
It would be very interesting to hear that there are organisations putting design jobs out to contract who are now demanding from interested parties evidence of accessible design expertise in the form of formal qualifications!

its a lovely idea, there has been some talk of wai running a course, but I don't think details were ever finalised take a look at: .htm&amp;listing.ID=0008140 or they probably aren't what you're after, but worth a look jonathan chetwynd on the web" learning difficulty get the most from the web" 
I do not know anything about the quality of this but at least it gives a certificate.

Dear David, In answer to why I am asking for accreditation as a result of a need to prove something to potential clients, I will say this: When speaking to clients within the 'new media' industry, the need to show relevant qualifications on specialist subjects is becoming paramount. 
I have been working with accessibility for approximately 15 months now, and although I can show the ability of *knowing what I am talking about*, when I am helping pitch a client that has not spoken to me directly they have no way of knowing if I know anything about the subject, let alone implementing it. 
So, that is the basis for my question. 
The reason that it is arising, I believe, is that it is simple nowadays to find an article within industry press, read up a bit on the subject and then sell that 'knowledge' to a client, when in actual fact they think that all that is required is a few alt attributes on a website and it is going to be accessible to all. 
I taught myself basic HTML through the need to speak to technical staff, and am currently taking myself through a beginners guide to JavaScript and ASP, in order that I can help solve problems with technically-minded people. 
I don't profess to be a PhD on the subject, but I am proud that I have found ways to work around things through sheer persistence, often without the help of a technical mind. 
To be able to apply my knowledge to a course that has accreditation within this Web industry is something that would help me in my job, as well as allowing me to move in my career should I wish to do so. 
I am lucky that the agency I work for takes the accessibility issue seriously and uses it as a basis for pitching for work, and we are having a great success with that. 
Not only that, our clients are beginning to see the benefits of this service, especially as the legal issues in the UK are being taken up by commercial websites. 
As with anything commercial, the ability to show (on paper) that you can do a job always helps enormously. 
In many cases, clients may not be aware of the issue, or if they are they simply think that it only involves a few alt attributes, when clearly it is a bigger issue than that. 
I don't want to waffle on too much here, as I feel that I have said enough. 
I hope that this clarifies the question to everyone. 
Also, a big big thank you to everyone who has replied. 
The resources that you have all listed is going to come in very handy. 
Kind regards to all

This isn't exactly what you're looking for, because of the location, but I'll respond to the list anyway in case others are interested. 
GW Solutions (a division of George Washington University) in the US is offering a continuing ed certificate program in usability and accessibility. 
They're still working on the distance learning side of it, I believe; the first scheduled class on accessibility in a classroom setting is either this month or early next month.

Hello Simon. 
Might I suggest that you contact the RNIB, and check to see if they might know of someone or some establishment that could be able to help you ?

Jon Gunderson at the University of Illinois offers an excellent online course called "Designing Universally Accessible Resources for the Web (REHAB711)".

judy has kindly reminded me of http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ which whilst at first might not seem ideal, does link to many useful resources. 
and of course reading (with understanding and practice) primary sources such as wcag and the training resources here: http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview.html#gl will lend you credence and authority.
