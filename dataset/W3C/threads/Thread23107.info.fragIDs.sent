<s> Some initial comments, more will follow.  </s>
<s> Section 1.2.4:  </s>
<s> The text describing DOMObject is a copy of the DOMUserData description.  </s>
<s> Section 1.3.1:  </s>
<s> "typically using uppercase for element names and lowercase for attribute names" See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2003AprJun/0104.html.  </s>
<s> The "typical" behavior in the L3 Core is contrary to DOM L2 HTML which  </s>
<s> specifies that both attribute names and element names should be uppercase which currently only Opera and Konqueror implement.  </s>
<s> The best solution I see is to issue an errata to L2 HTML specifying that attribute should be lowercase.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, this sentence should be expanded to not appear to be recommending behavior contrary to L2 HTML.  </s>
<s> Section 1.3.3:  </s>
<s> "For example, applications may have to declare every namespace in use when serializing a document" This may be a holdover before L3 Load/Save with L/S, I do not believe that you would have to add xmlns attributes for namespaces in use.  </s>
<s> "Note: Element.setAttributesNS(null...) put" Should be "puts" "The new methods, such as Document.createElementNS"  </s>
<s> These methods were introduced in L2 Core and in this context would not be "new"  </s>
<s> Section 1.3.5:  </s>
<s> "are developing DOM extensions" Is the tense correct.  </s>
<s> I think that they "have developed" might be more appropriate now.  </s>
<s> Section 1.3.6:  </s>
<s> "thus for versions "1.0", "2.0", "3.0" There has been a bug on www-dom-ts to ask for clarification if hasFeature("Core", "1.0") should return true since the L1 recommendation only had "XML" and "HTML" features.  </s>
<s> This sentence should reflect the resolution of that issue.  </s>
<s> At the end of the first paragraph of 1.4, "1.0" is omitted which could be interpreted as supporting the "Core didn't exist in L1" position.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> (added on the Core issues list)  </s>
<s> This is correct, but if an application wishes to serialize a document by itself, the comment is still valid.  </s>
<s> So I would be in favor of leaving it as is.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> The feature "Core" wasn't defined in "1.0".  </s>
<s> The text in DOM Level 2 Core is indeed misleading and should not make any claims regarding hasFeature("Core", "1.0").  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 3 Core was changed as follows: For example, this specification defines the features "Core" and "XML", and thus for the version "3.0".  </s>
<s> Versions "1.0" and "2.0" can also be used for features defined in the corresponding DOM Levels.  </s>
<s> An erratum should be published soon for DOM Level 2. Philippe  </s>
<s> The group concluded that an erratum for DOM Level 2 HTML is necessary but given the impact on Opera and Konqueror, we'll need to check with them first with a proposed erratum.  </s>
<s> In any case, the issue is not considered a showstopper for DOM Level 3 Core.  </s>
