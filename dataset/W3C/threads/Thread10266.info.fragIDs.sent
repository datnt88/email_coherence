<s> Summary: reject.  </s>
<s> The comment is The introduction of pairs consisting of a lexical form and a type (or, strictly speaking, a lexical form and a type label) seems at first glance to complicate the RDF model somewhat.  </s>
<s> We have had the impression that in other parts of RDF, typing is handled by adding further arcs and nodes.  </s>
<s> If the type of a resource is identified by having an arc labeled rdf:type from it to (the URI of) its (RDF) type, and if the type of an arc is similarly identified by an arc, then surely a reason ought to be given for shifting to a different method for typing literal strings.  </s>
<s> It seems like a dramatic shift in the infrastructure of RDF, from "everything is a node, an arc, or a literal value" to "everything is a node, an arc, or a typed literal value".  </s>
<s> Perhaps not quite so dramatic, after all.  </s>
<s> But the question of design consistency remains: why not "everything is a typed node, a typed arc, or a typed literal"?  </s>
<s> The propose response is to do nothing.  </s>
<s> Here is a draft reply: We have considered your comment and rejected it.  </s>
<s> This aspect of the new design has been the one that we found the most difficult, and we are not surprised that aspects of it seem overly complicated.  </s>
<s> To answer your question as to why we use a different means to type literals than that used to type nodes and properties: - RDF nodes and properties are typically untryped.  </s>
<s> Type information can be added monotonically, potentially by a further document elsewhere on the Web, or by an inference rule.  </s>
<s> - untyped literals, however, are character strings, or pairs of character strings and language tags.  </s>
<s> Adding type information, such as maling a speciifc literal node into an xsd:int, is not monotonic, but a destructive operation, in that previously true information, and valid inferences may cease to be true.  </s>
<s> Because of this difference in the behaviour of literal nodes from other nodes in response to addiitonal type information, the WG decided to provide a different mechanism, operating syntactically, rather than the rdf:type mechanism which operates semantically.  </s>
<s> We remind you that the group was far from unanimous in its discussions concerning literal typing, with Mike Dean's formal objection being indicative of the minority position: Jeremy  </s>
<s> Summary: I'm wondering if the response misses the point of the comment.  </s>
<s> The comment says "surely a reason ought to be given" why we don't describe the type of a literal as we did the type of other resources, i.e. with a property arc whose subject is the literal to the type.  </s>
<s> I suggest: The WG interprets this comment as two questions and a comment:  </s>
<s> 1) Why is the type of a literal not described using a property arc, as is done for other literals?  </s>
<s> 2) Having introduced typed literal nodes, why not introduce typed resource nodes and typed property arcs as well 3) The WG should provide a rationale for this design in the specifications Regarding question 1: This would require that literals be allowed as subjects of RDF statements.  </s>
<s> This is not possible in current RDF/XML and would require considerable change, beyond the scope of the WG, to support it.  </s>
<s> Further it introduces problems of non-monotonicity in the semantics.  </s>
<s> A property whose value is plain literal is currently taken to denote a sequence characters.  </s>
<s> Adding a further statement could change that value to, say an integer, invalidating previous inferences and breaking a fundamental tenet of RDF.  </s>
<s> Regarding question 2: No requirement justified a change to the notion of a URIREF node or an RDF arc.  </s>
<s> Regarding comment 3: Providing a rationale document to accompany the specifications would certainly be nice to have, but given we don't have the resources to do one, must remain so.  </s>
<s> We reject this comment on the grounds that the specifications are not intended to provide a rationale.  </s>
<s> typo below:  </s>
<s> should be 'other resources'.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.... sorry, but I don't myself buy that explanation.  </s>
<s> I don't see how asserting a datatype to a literal (presuming an untidy treatment of course) is any different than asserting a type for any resource.  </s>
<s> If long range datatyping is non-monotonic then all RDF typing is non-monotonic.  </s>
<s> The *real* reason, IMO, why the proposal should be rejected is because to accept it would require literals to be subjects and I think the WG has a fair bit of consensus that such a change would not be allowed by the present charter.  </s>
<s> (Though I fully agree that having literals as subjects and allowing rdf:type assertions with datatype objects would have been the most elegant solution overall) I suggest that the response be changed to focus on the disallowance of literals as subjects rather than positing non-montonicity of long range datatyping (which I don't see is a problem).  </s>

<s> Patrick:  </s>
<s> Did you prefer Brian's text?  </s>
<s> - he talked about both literals as subjects and non-monotonicity.  </s>
<s> He certainly phrased it more gently, which is a good thing.  </s>
<s> My view is that the crucial test cases that determined the current design were ones like jenny age "10" .  </s>
<s> film title "10" .  </s>
<s> entails jenny age _:b .  </s>
<s> film title _:b .  </s>
<s> I was trying to indicate that without getting into detail.  </s>
<s> (Patrick both you and I disagreed with the WG decision on this test case;  </s>
<s> however, that does not mean that we cannot try and articulate why, having decided this test case, much of the rest falls into place.  </s>
<s> I would ceratinly agree that the WG could have gone the other way, and not had a monotonicity problem with global datatyping) Jeremy  </s>
<s> I think we could simply say that the particular approach suggested would require literals as subjects and that was precluded by the charger.  </s>
<s> Trying to say more (especially mentioning monotonicity issues, etc.) is just going to open up yet another lengthy discussion about the myriad of options we've already worked through.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
