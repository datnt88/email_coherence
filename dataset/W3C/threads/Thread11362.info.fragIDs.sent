<s> On the subject of fragment IDs, there seems to be some confusion.  </s>
<s> There are two kinds of fragments.  </s>
<s> One is a standalone part of a larger document, where only the fragment is served.  </s>
<s> That isn't the web fragment, though.  </s>
<s> The other is a named  </s>
<s> part of a document, where you have the whole document, and want to go to a particular region (surrounded in HTML with A NAME=xxx .... /X ).  </s>
<s> Please don't confuse them.  </s>
<s> SGML Open fragments are nothing whatsoever to do with the # kind of fragments.  </s>
<s> I'll call them chunks for now.  </s>
<s> In a web world, you are supposed to do SGML Open chunks by giving each chunk its own URL, just as DynaWeb (there!  </s>
<s> I spelt it right!) does.  </s>
<s> Since # is for something different than chunks, it doesn't have to solve the chunk requirements, and therefore the fact that the #stuff doesn't get sent to the server turns out not to be a problem.  </s>

<s> Or two things named "fragments".  </s>
<s> That is fragment as I usually think of it.  </s>
<s> A separable piece of a whole.  </s>
<s> That is a named location with an element to anchor the locator.  </s>
<s> Call it a fragment if you like, but that isn't what one usually thinks of as a fragment in SGML.  </s>
<s> Thats a position to scroll to.  </s>
<s> Sounds like it got confused in the W3C HTML WG.  </s>
<s> How does that work?  </s>
<s> IOW, what gets returned?  </s>
<s> The document, or the fragment/chunk/frame?  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting a different URL convention for the SGML fragment?  </s>
<s> Again, what gets returned?  </s>

<s> Please don't do this!  </s>
<s> Let's not add confusion by trying to rename something that's had a perfectly good name for some time now.  </s>
<s> What TR9601 deals with are fragments, let's not try to start calling them chunks now.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that, of the two uses of the word "fragment," the one referring to a named region of the document is misnamed.  </s>
<s> How about "named region"?  </s>
<s> Like it or not, the name of the "#foo" thing at the end of a URL is called a "fragment identifier".  </s>
<s> There is really nothing wrong with the name, as it is an identifier for a fragment within an HTML document.  </s>
<s> You can futz about with names all you like.  </s>
<s> The fragment identifier is entrenched in Web-speak.  </s>
<s> There is no getting around that.  </s>
<s> Trying to rename it will only create confusion for the large base of HTML users.  </s>
<s> Just my humble opinion, Murray  </s>

<s> Well, note that HTML fragments have been so named since 1989 or so, and the name is in use by hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people.  </s>
<s> I used the term "chunks" only within that message, to tryand disambiguate.  </s>
<s> You could tak about Word Wide Web Fragments to mean the normal usage, and SGML Open fragments for the other normal usage, I suppose.  </s>
<s> I'm more concerneed that people understand that they're different, and that the # mechanism in use on the Web today is for addressing WWW fragments.  </s>
<s> There is another proposed standard for retrieving only a portion of a document from a remote server, but you're not going to like that name either -- it's XML, from Adobe and Verity! Lee  </s>
