Hi Folks, 
Please test the short html-fragment below! 
I think all lines should give the same result. 
(It works in Netscape and Arena to.)

Although I'd expect it, the CSS model doesn't require this and one can construct style sheets that will generate different behaviour. 
The browser has an implicit style sheet, and who is to tell that this doesn't specify different results for the different cases.

The lines should give the same results if the wanted result is available. 
This is a combination of bold, italics and underline. 
Most fonts come with a separate font for bold and italics (and sometimes also underline). 
If the font you use is such a font and there is no 
bold&amp;italics&amp;underline one, it is up to the application (or the Xserver) to display a font. 
This can be forgetting the first code or neglecting the last one. 
CB Try not to let implementation details sneak into design documents.

These are not font attributes, they are selectors for style sheet rules which may in turn set font attributes. 
I would agree that the browser's default style sheet ought to map them through as though they were font attributes.

You are right. 
All lines should look the same. 
This bug will be fixed in the next minor release, probably next week. 
However, all lines will be displayed in bold, underlined, but not in italics, as the underlying formatting engine inherited from Thot cannot currently display bold italics fonts. 
We hope to be able to fix that in a later release. 
Vincent.
