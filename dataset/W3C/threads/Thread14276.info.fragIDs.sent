<s> Jonathan, At my first, the previous teleconference (4?) someone described the difficulty that CAST was having finding means of determining and labeling the reading level of text that was to be used in text to speech software.  </s>
<s> CAST has apparently learned that merely provide speech synthezation isn't all that is needed to make the web accessible to all visually impaired folks with normal hearing.  </s>
<s> CAST has discovered that various cognition levels in visually impaired folks will render text-to-speech pretty useless if the text being spoken is signigicantly above the cognition level of the user.  </s>
<s> If this is a problem for the visually impaired folks, who are presumed to have more or less "normal" cognition, how much greater then is the problem when we are talking about people with different or impaired cognition?  </s>
<s> Back with an early Apple IIe machine, I went out on a limb and bought a speech synthesizer for a visually impaired student with a very low IQ.  </s>
<s> Not only did my girl hate the synthesized speech (worse than she hated the talking books she got from the state), but it didn't enable her to use "normal" level materials for instruction either.  </s>
<s> Text to speech doesn't work for everyone we could hope it would, but I shudder to think of the consequences if it hadn't been developed.  </s>
<s> The speech synthesizer we had would only read text files from a disk, not from the Internet (although there really wasn't much K-12 content on the Internet back then except on mailing lists).  </s>

<s> One has to distinguish objectives.  </s>
<s> The accessibility guidelines are targeted to a scenario where the objective is to inform, and one does not care if it is too easy to understand.  </s>
<s> This is not ideal, just actual.  </s>
<s> The pedagogical scenario, where it is desired to challenge the reader enough, but not too much -- that scenario is addressed by the teaching machines from CAST but not by the guidelines from the WAI.  </s>
<s> This is a more  </s>
<s> advanced objective requiring greater subtlety.  </s>
<s> It can be satisfied by giving managed access to the wealth of media-redundant information required in the ideal universally-accessible document.  </s>
<s> This is access with resistance, to build skills where they can be developed.  </s>
<s> Note that there is a whole thread to be developed on how excess ease of comprehension makes content boring, and artfully modulated difficulty in processing the message can be entertaining and add interest.  </s>
<s> This is one of the reasons why commercial speech is not maximally accessible.  </s>
<s> It has to create interest and not just deliver information.  </s>
<s> The teaser for an article is a teaser; it connects with the reader and then is coy.  </s>
<s> It creates the impression that if you read the full article you will know more than you know now.  </s>
<s> Often there is nothing there.  </s>
<s> But the introduction or promotional blurb has to create both connection and disconnection to motivate the next step.  </s>

<s> "One has to distinguish objectives.  </s>
<s> The accessibility guidelines are targeted to a scenario where the objective is to inform, and one does not care if it is too easy to understand.  </s>
<s> This is not ideal, just actual."  </s>
<s> "Inform" assumes that one is communicating, And that the knowledge is being transferred.  </s>
<s> This means that it is intended to be pedagogical, although you claim that the guidelines are not.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you mean to say that the audience is atypical and that is precisely what I am objecting to.  </s>
<s> On a more positive note I have heard that the Education and Outreach Group are developing an alternative approach.  </s>

<s> I know that one can call them both instruction, but there is still a difference to be observed.  </s>
<s> Let me try again.  </s>
<s> Would you distinguish between subcategories of pedagogy to impart facts or to cultivate skills?  </s>
<s> To cultivate skills, you want to challenge the learner some, but not more than they can ovecome.  </s>
<s> To impart facts, it is not so important to create challenges along the way.  </s>
<s> You raised the "Ant and Bee stories" as an example of good pedagogical literature.  </s>
<s> Because they challenge the reader a little and not too much.  </s>
<s> I am saying that for the guidelines as they stand now, that is too sophisticated a criterion.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are quite simple, and aim to avoid the worst cases where things get really difficult or impossible.  </s>
<s> Applying a challenge that is not too small as well as not too large is beyond the state of consensus knowledge of the group as it published WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> It is a very real challenge for educational materials.  </s>
<s> But that is art beyond the contemporary state of knowledge of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Not what I meant.  </s>
<s> I was talking about what kind of knowledge is, and is not, contained in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Knowledge of how not to be too difficult is contained in these guidelines.  </s>
<s> Knowledge of how to be just difficult enough is not.  </s>
<s> They are going to try to make the guidelines more understandable.  </s>
<s> But not to change what they mean.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> "The power of the web is in its universality.  </s>
<s> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect" Quoted in the UK Guardian Newspaper Thursday 15 July.  </s>
<s> It is funny kind of Universality that excludes non-readers The Guidelines make frequent reference to learning difficulty, but do not give advice, whereas they do give advice for helping visitors who are blind.  </s>
<s> Moreover the 'discussions' in great part are concerned with specifics (ie alt text)that directly affect the users experience.  </s>
<s> Unless people start making an effort to understand issues concerning LD it is unlikely that progress will be made.  </s>
<s> For all the strengths at the WAI your efforts and arguments are lack lustre, and show a lack of concern.  </s>
