Hello I was wondering if it is possible to set the background color, the text color, and the font size of an SMIL document. 
I am trying to input the text from a file, but I do not want to limit it only to real text format. 
I want it to be a normal text file which even quicktime can use. 
So could you please tell me how to do the requested items. 
A quick reply would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks Sincerely, Raheel Ahmad Khan

Raheel, It would be nice to do what you like to have one file that could be used across media players, but unfortunately the world is not that kind to use (yet). 
You really need to design text tracks for a specific player and even the same player on different platforms often have different features. 
Text Track Formats: RealPlayer: RealText/SMIL Micosoft Media Player: SAMI (for captions only) Quicktime Player: QuickText/Some SMIL support or Text MOV tracks Wish there was a better solution, but not right now. 
SMIL 1.0 or 2.0 does not include a Text Track specification. 
There is a new group forming in the W3C that will be trying to define an open text track recommendation.

Hello I am having another problem with SMIL. 
With internet explorer, you have to use the object tag for the browser to play the smil file with the specified player. 
However, I want to know if there is any option where the internet explorer doesn't specify a file and opens up the smil file in any player that is capable of playing SMIL files. 
A quick reply would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks. 
I am unaware of ways to author content where the author specifies what piece of software should be used to render something at the other end. 
Thus, I interpret your question to be about IE options, and for those questions I suggest that you consult the IE documentation.

in HTML 4 I believe that you can specify the player to be used for a given object, but I don't think it is required. 
You should be able to specify the data source, and type, and have your browser find you a player if it has one.

Raheel: As I understand it, Explorer uses the file type to player binding that is hosted by the operating system in "the directory." 
In any directory review window, look under View : Folder Options : File Types for more information. 
Hit 'S' and then arrow down through the S entries until you find SMIL or pass where it alphabetically should be and isn't. 
Whether you need to use the OBJECT tag is another matter. 
But in Windows, the first rule is that the file name [last thing in the URI proper, excluding any #fragment] should end with a signature extension, in this case .smi or .smil, for the media type. 
[Yes, in HTML4 one can indicate the type of an object, but this is 'advisory' and the player will be picked in IE according to the file extension, IIRC.] 
If the user has installed a SMIL-capable tool, that tool will normally have attempted to capture the SMIL file type for itself to be the designated player of that type. 
For example, in my case installing Real it was a no-brainer. 
There was no entry for SMIL prior to that so the registry had no conflict to resolve or ask about. 
In any case, for platforms where the user is on Microsoft Windows as the OS, the above is the normal process as I understand it and installing GRINS or any other SMIL competent player (and naming files with the extensions that Windows recognizes) should get your job done. 
The OBJECT issue may be something else dealing with multimedia as a class. 
I don't know about that aspect. 
Did you first play with examples available already on the Web? 
You could pursue the public and developer knowledge bases at Microsoft.COM concerning how IE implements multimedia.
