<s> Hello I was wondering if it is possible to set the background color, the text color, and the font size of an SMIL document.  </s>
<s> I am trying to input the text from a file, but I do not want to limit it only to real text format.  </s>
<s> I want it to be a normal text file which even quicktime can use.  </s>
<s> So could you please tell me how to do the requested items.  </s>
<s> A quick reply would be greatly appreciated.  </s>

<s> Raheel, It would be nice to do what you like to have one file that could be used across media players, but unfortunately the world is not that kind to use (yet).  </s>
<s> You really need to design text tracks for a specific player and even the same player on different platforms often have different features.  </s>
<s> Text Track Formats: RealPlayer: RealText/SMIL Micosoft Media Player: SAMI (for captions only) Quicktime Player: QuickText/Some SMIL support or Text MOV tracks Wish there was a better solution, but not right now.  </s>
<s> SMIL 1.0 or 2.0 does not include a Text Track specification.  </s>
<s> There is a new group forming in the W3C that will be trying to define an open text track recommendation.  </s>

<s> Hello I am having another problem with SMIL.  </s>
<s> With internet explorer, you have to use the object tag for the browser to play the smil file with the specified player.  </s>
<s> However, I want to know if there is any option where the internet explorer doesn't specify a file and opens up the smil file in any player that is capable of playing SMIL files.  </s>
<s> A quick reply would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I am unaware of ways to author content where the author specifies what piece of software should be used to render something at the other end.  </s>
<s> Thus, I interpret your question to be about IE options, and for those questions I suggest that you consult the IE documentation.  </s>

<s> in HTML 4 I believe that you can specify the player to be used for a given object, but I don't think it is required.  </s>
<s> You should be able to specify the data source, and type, and have your browser find you a player if it has one.  </s>

<s> Raheel: As I understand it, Explorer uses the file type to player binding that is hosted by the operating system in "the directory."  </s>
<s> In any directory review window, look under View : Folder Options : File Types for more information.  </s>
<s> Hit 'S' and then arrow down through the S entries until you find SMIL or pass where it alphabetically should be and isn't.  </s>
<s> Whether you need to use the OBJECT tag is another matter.  </s>
<s> But in Windows, the first rule is that the file name [last thing in the URI proper, excluding any #fragment] should end with a signature extension, in this case .smi or .smil, for the media type.  </s>
<s> [Yes, in HTML4 one can indicate the type of an object, but this is 'advisory' and the player will be picked in IE according to the file extension, IIRC.]  </s>
<s> If the user has installed a SMIL-capable tool, that tool will normally have attempted to capture the SMIL file type for itself to be the designated player of that type.  </s>
<s> For example, in my case installing Real it was a no-brainer.  </s>
<s> There was no entry for SMIL prior to that so the registry had no conflict to resolve or ask about.  </s>
<s> In any case, for platforms where the user is on Microsoft Windows as the OS, the above is the normal process as I understand it and installing GRINS or any other SMIL competent player (and naming files with the extensions that Windows recognizes) should get your job done.  </s>
<s> The OBJECT issue may be something else dealing with multimedia as a class.  </s>
<s> I don't know about that aspect.  </s>
<s> Did you first play with examples available already on the Web?  </s>
<s> You could pursue the public and developer knowledge bases at Microsoft.COM concerning how IE implements multimedia.  </s>
<s> It may also be helpful to review the XHTML+SMIL profile at XHTML+SMIL Profile Al  </s>
