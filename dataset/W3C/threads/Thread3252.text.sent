Hi, After an e-mail discussion with W3 staff people (Olivier and Karl, from the QA group), we came to the conclusion that sharing my experience with Web standards promotion could help other people replicating and/or adapting the French projects I have been participating to in their respective countries and regions. 
You'll find a very first draft on It is more or less supposed to be a sequel to It may eventually, after review, being published on W3.org. 
Suggestion, critics and reviews are more than welcome. 
Cheers, --Tristan Mozilla and OpenWebGroup contributor Hello Tristan, On Saturday, May 24, 2003, at 12:41 Europe/Budapest, Tristan Nitot This article looks very good indeed. 
You're saying it is a draft, how far do you think it is from completion? 
Do you want a review from this list now, or for a later draft? 
Given its scope and the scope of the existing "LocalAction" article in W3C QA space, I believe both could easily be merged. 
What do you think? 
Olivier Hi Tristan, Your article is encouraging reading indeed. 
As you call it a draft do you have any particular topic to extend ? 
Most governments have official policies supporting open web standards. 
However, it generally seems that the purhcasing policy for authoring tools is not related to this. 
Perhaps there is a way of comparing the standards compliance of different authoring tools to support more informed (public) procurement.

: Thanks! 
The current draft is ready for review, IMHO. 
I wrote it more as a sequel to "LocalAction". 
That would be fine for me to be a co-author of the resulting work, but I'm not sure I'd be able to do the merge myself. 
If you want to do it, please do. 
--Tristan A comparison of the standards-compliance of some HTML-based online Help authoring tools has been done. 
It's available at Regards, David Knopf ~ Knopf Online ~ San Francisco, CA Consulting &amp; Training on FrameMaker &amp; WebWorks Publisher WebWorks Publisher Certified Member, JavaHelp 2.0 Expert Group Moderator, HATT, wwp-users &amp; wordhelp Hello, Thank you for the interesting HAT link. 
We are considering to carry out a small assment of Authoring tools by analysing some web content. 
One problem here is that only about 5% of the pages we have looked at seem to use the generator tag. 
Would you know of some other way to identify what tool has been used to generate a page? 
Perhaps some kind of fingerprint scheme ? 
Greetings. 
Mikael Snaprud I think it's very difficult to identify the authoring tool automatically in the absence of a meta generator tag. 
(And even then, the user can change the meta tag.) Some tools do leave obvious fingerprints, which can be identified by examing the code, but others do not. 
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. 
Regards, David Knopf ~ Knopf Online ~ San Francisco, CA Consulting &amp; Training on FrameMaker &amp; WebWorks Publisher WebWorks Publisher Certified Member, JavaHelp 2.0 Expert Group Moderator, HATT, wwp-users &amp; wordhelp Hi, Another draft, almost final, should I say, is not available on Now, it is complete, but it still needs final review. 
Do you want a review from this list now, or for a later draft? 
A review from the list would be awesome. 
I'm not sure to understand how we could merge these two articles together. 
Would it be a complete rewrite of the whole stuff, of would it be just a copy / paste of my article into the "starting local initiatives" section ? 
anyway, all feedback welcome. 
--Tristan Netscape AOL Technologies, Standards Evangelist, Europe Hello Tristan, Hi all. 
Good, starting reading it now. 
Something in between. 
I believe your article is a very worthy addition to the existing material, and knowing our audience, I'm certain it's better to have one good article rather than two to cover this topic. 
Hence the need to merge. 
I suppose a full rewrite won't be needed, and a copy-paste won't be good enough, but something in between should be OK. Thoughts?
