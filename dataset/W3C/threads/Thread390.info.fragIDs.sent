hello everyone, 
tidy sure has helped me alot! 
cleaning up my XML sources I ran into a core dump any time I reached a ![CDATA[ ... ]] section, I tried the Java version too and it crashed. 
I replaced my CDATA with the one refrenced in the realease note, it crashed both the c and java version of tidy also. 
trace info below... any help would be appreciated, oh and my CDATA sections contained XML... I know it shouldn't matter but I cant figure out how to use CDATA and tidy the rest of my XML. os: linux 2.2.12 
tidy release: 13th January 2000 thanks, -rick (gdb) where

Tidy doesn't yet support CDATA marked sections, and this is noted in the documentation: p XML processors compliant with W3C's XML 1.0 recommendation are very picky about which files they will accept. 
Tidy can help you to fix errors that cause your XML files to be rejected. 
Tidy doesn't yet recognize all XML features though, e.g. it doesn't understand CDATA sections or DTD subsets. 
/p However, this is long over due and will be fixed in the next release.

Dave, from the release note... 
I have added support for CDATA marked sections which are passed through without change, e.g. 
I thought it was supported.

You're right - I just checked - perhaps the bug was from an older version of Tidy?
