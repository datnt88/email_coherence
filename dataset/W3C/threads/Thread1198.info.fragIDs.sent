hi, 
tidying up this javascript: 
onChange="JumpMenu(this.options[this.selectedIndex].value)"; return true; '); 
document.write(' option value="about_es.htm" 
Castellano \/option '); 
gives me no change in the html code. 
However, the output document is not well-formed xml. 
How can I make Tidy work with this JS or simply delete JS content ? 
thanks, 
Fabrice 
You should use the -asxml (--output-xhtml yes) config option then. 
Thanks for your idea but I had set this option to 'yes'...without success. 
Here is my config file: 
markup: yes tidy-mark: no input-xml: no output-xhtml: yes output-xml: yes fix-uri: yes force-output: yes show-warnings: yes show-errors: 10 input-encoding: latin1 output-encoding: latin1 numeric-entities: no quote-marks: no quote-nbsp: no quote-ampersand: no break-before-br: no uppercase-tags: yes uppercase-attributes: yes literal-attributes: no indent: yes wrap: 0 Fabrice 
Are you sure Tidy actually reads your configuration file? 
And if it does, what is your `tidy -version`? 
I am unable to reproduce such a behavior. 
i'm actually using JTidy version: 04aug2000r7 (the latest, I think...) thanks for your fast support ;-)

Then I would suggest to ask on the http://jtidy.sf.net/mail-lists.html 
JTidy mailing lists whether this has been fixed since. 
It is fixed in HTML Tidy for several years now.
