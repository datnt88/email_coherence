<s> Hi all, For the following XML: ?xml  </s>

<s> foo f='100' /foo when getChildNodes() is called on the root element, different implementations of DOM return NodeList of different length.  </s>
<s> Xerces2-J and Crimson return a NodeList which contains 1 Text node of value "100" DOM4j and Python's minidom return a NodeList containing no nodes.  </s>
<s> This could be a problem if one's doing a comparison between two DOM implementations.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this case is not covered by the current DOM-TS, and I couldn't find anything on DOM spec.  </s>
<s> What should be the correct haviour?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, ML  </s>
<s> I think attributes should not show up as childnodes... wether an element is the root element shouldn't make a difference Do you Yahoo!? SBC Yahoo!  </s>

<s> I can't imagine why they'd do this; attributes are not children of the element node, and their children certainly are not.  </s>

<s> Calling getChildNodes on a DOM Attr node does return the children of the Attr, which are the text and EntityReference nodes that make up the Attr's content.  </s>
<s> Calling getChildNodes on an element does *NOT* return the Attr nodes or their descendents.  </s>
<s> Attributes are not children in the DOM, and do not have parents (though they may have an Owner Element).  </s>
