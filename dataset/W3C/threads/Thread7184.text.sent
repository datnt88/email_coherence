I have just submitted draft 02, which can also be obtained via the issues list at Please note that all issues have been fixed or closed, with the single exception that 032-component-examples is still waiting for some examples that might improve the current description. 
This would be a good time to review the specification.

Roy, latest draft looks great, except for the following issues (all minor): Under no reasonable definition of the phrase "in common use" could the gopher URI fit. 
It should be removed. 
In Appendix D, please consider putting the names of rules in brackets , as recommended in RFC 2234, Section 2.1. 
There's not enough information to dereference [Siedzik]. 
The symbolic name [UTF-8} should be changed to [RFC2279] for consistency. 
Also, please change ?rfc 
sortrefs="no"? 
to yes to make it easier to review the references.

Thanks. 
It is pretty common in historical documents. 
;-) Seriously, though, gopher is still in common use in Universities. 
I'd prefer to find a replacement example, such as imap or urn -- suggestions are welcome. 
I actually tried that while working on 03 and the result was butt-ugly and much harder to read. 
Unless there is a strong objection, I'd prefer to keep it clean. 
Hmm, I guess we should be consistent. 
Personally, I prefer symbolic names like UTF-8 except when we are referring to a specific RFC number. 
Unfortunately, the xml2rfc doesn't know much about non-RFC references. 
....Roy At 21:38 03/06/09 -0700, Roy T. Fielding responded to Dan Kohn: Makes sense to me. 
Try putting the URI into the target attribute of the reference element. 
That worked for me. 
Regards, Martin.
