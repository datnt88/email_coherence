<s> The most complex is a 3D machine, in motion if you want to make it even harder.  </s>
<s> Are there any guidelines on how to describe these diagrams?  </s>
<s> For example, you could use lists and nested lists for linear sequences and trees respectively.  </s>
<s> Or you could use prose.  </s>
<s> More general diagrams are, well, a more general problem.  </s>
<s> What techniques are best for what purposes and audiences?  </s>
<s> What's good wording, especially for prose decriptions?  </s>
<s> I'm mainly thinking of speech output here, since that's what most blind surfers will be using, rather than Braille or tactile graphics.  </s>
<s> This is no doubt hard to encapsulate... at some point you just have to get a skilled technical writer, especially for the prose versions... Len Leonard R.
