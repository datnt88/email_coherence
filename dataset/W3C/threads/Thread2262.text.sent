Here's an inexact application survey: Does anyone use, or know of an application that uses, cookies that are labeled "Secure"? 
If not, I will consider simply removing "Secure" from the cookie spec. 
Dave Kristol I know an application which is quite likely to want the unsecure implication of secure ... that is, set the cookie in a secure response and have it returned in a non-secure transaction. 
The application is still in the prototype phase. 
Dave Morris -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- If by removing it, cookies set on secure connections would be returned on insecure ones (given the removal of the port restrictions), I think that would be bad. 
I know I have at least one application where I would not want secure cookies sent insecurely, so they are marked "Secure".
