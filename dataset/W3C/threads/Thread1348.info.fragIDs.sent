(II.5) Move all DAV:supported-xxx properties to the OPTIONS response. 
Move all DAV:xxx-collection-set properties to the OPTIONS response. 
Done. 
Do we need DAV:supported-live-properties? 
Servers are required to protect the names of all live properties (whether they support them or not), so PROPPATCH will fail if the property is unsupported. 
Servers should not define a live property that it does not support, and PROPFIND would return 404 Not Found. 
Since the protocol does not distinguish between dead and live properties, a server has no way of knowing whether the PROPPATCH was to a dead property or to a live property that it doesn't know about. 
I recall that we used to say that servers must protect all defined live properties (i.e., names) in the spec, even those properties that were unsupported. 
I didn't see that statement in a quick scan of the latest spec, so has it been dropped? 
If yes, then I presume it is now encumbant upon clients to (a) check that a live property is supported before setting it (and expecting it to have any effect on the server), and (b) check that a live property is supported before getting it to check that some other client didn't violate (a). 
It would seem to be less of a burden for the server to protect the property name (and effectively enforce (a)) than expect the client to do two queries (OPTIONS and PROPPATCH/FIND) for each live property operation.

I agree -- the server should "protect" unsupported live props.

Section 2.8 Additional PROPPATCH Semantics (DAV:cannot-modify-unsupported-property) DAV:supported-live-properties isn't for the live properties defined in the protocol (they can be discovered via the DAV: header from the OPTIONS request). 
It is for server defined live properties, that a user might be able to make sense of, even if the client wasn't designed with them in mind. 
It is expected that versioning servers will all have at least a few server specific live properties.
