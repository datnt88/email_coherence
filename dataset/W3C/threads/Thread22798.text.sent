here is some example code... maybe you are using it incorrectly? 
var xmldoc = new ActiveXObject("microsoft.xmldom"); xmldoc.loadXML(" 
books/ "); bookelem= xmldoc.createElement("book"); 
booknode= xmldoc.documentElement.appendChild(bookelem); 
booknode.setAttribute("name","Introduction 
to XML"); booknode.setAttribute("price","22.00"); Hello! 
I'm making an ISAPI DLL that parses an XML file to retrieve the XML data in a repository. 
I'm using the MSXML parser, using IXMLDOM structures. 
Well, I send the XML file as string parameter to this DLL and I'm trying load it using the "loadXML" method. 
I'm beign some troubles with this loading and I really don't know what's the matter? 
Anyone haven't this trouble yet? 
Thanks for reading, Jair.

in I I There's no loadXML method in the W3C DOM. 
Maybe someone here can help you, but you probably ought to ask on a Microsoft-specific list or forum. 
This happens a lot; maybe someone can give us the address of the appropriate place to ask MS-specific DOM questions?

If loadXML() failes (boolean return code), check document.parseError.reason 
for details.
