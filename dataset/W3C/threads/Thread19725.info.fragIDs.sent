<s> Did you reinstall the Solaris binary as well?  </s>
<s> It's linked to X11R6, which is NOT standard equipment for fresh-off-the-CD Solaris 2.5.1 (the old Amaya was linked to X11R5, which is).  </s>
<s> The binary is important for those OSes that don't come with a C compiler, IMO-- even if they are Unix.  </s>
<s> While I'd recompile it myself, both the free gnu cc and gmake (gcc 2.7 core dumps (!) on a file 75% of the way through) and the not free Sun SPARCcompiler set was a no-go for the "make all," (the makefiles use gmake specific directives) so it looks like those who want to run it will have to roll up their sleeves and look at the source and makefiles to figure out what what of environment is needed to make the thing run.  </s>
<s> So it looks like both my Intel Solaris and my SPARC Solaris are out of luck.  </s>
<s> If recompiling the binary is a no-option (which locks out most Solaris users from using it), could you provide some hints as to the environment needed to make the package?  </s>

<s> It's linked with standard openwin libraries ?  </s>
