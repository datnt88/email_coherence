<s> Proposal to close hendler-01 Summary: rejected This request would require substantial changes to the RDF/XML grammar, make it more complex, introduce further tricky implementation work and require another last call WD.  </s>
<s> The resulting RDF graph can be generated from the existing RDF/XML albeit in a long form.  </s>
<s> NOTE * * * This is not yet a response to the issue raiser * * * Rationale [LONG - with examples] This request would require a substantial change to the RDF/XML syntax, so that would allow not only a list of node elements, but a list of what would might be called 'literal node elements'.  </s>
<s> This change would require another last call WD. Grammar Change Choices 1.  </s>
<s> The grammar would be changed to: start-element(URI == propertyElementURIs ), attributes == set(idAttr?, parseCollection)) (nodeElementList | literalNodeElementList) end-element() and new grammar productions literalNodeElementList ::= literalNodeElement* literalNode ::= start-element(URI == ???, attributes == set(datatypeAttr?, parseLiteral?))  </s>
<s> literal end-element() The latter would need new careful rules to handle both datatypes and parseType="Literal" forms (or the latter could be ruled out).  </s>
<s> This would mean inventing a new rdf term for ??? that would allow literals to be used where nodes were expected.  </s>
<s> I will use rdf:abc for this example rather than pick one.  </s>
<s> 2. Alternatively only http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#nodeElement could be changed to be handle the functionality above, but it is one of the most complex parts of the grammar and it would be difficult.  </s>
<s> Aside: If nodeElement was changed in this way, it *would* also allow literals to be given as subjects of triples.  </s>
<s> However this is a postponed RDF Core Issue: and if this choice was made, there would be temptation to change all the other working drafts in order to allow it in the semantics and abstract syntax, explain in the primer, etc. Examples of this new syntax So given rdf:abc and either of the above choices, you could then use: giving N-Triples: http://example.org/node  </s>

<s> I'm inclined to agree, and part of my reason is that by trying to fix just this problem I think we might miss a bigger opportunity.  </s>
<s> What follows is NOT a proposal, but an explanation of the above comment.  </s>
<s> Note that the formal semantics is now clear that all literal values can also be resources (i.e. are in IR).  </s>
<s> If we had a syntactic form that described a resource with the same value as a given literal, it would provide a solution to both this problem and the literals-as-subjects problem.  </s>
<s> E.g. rdf:LiteralValue [rdf:datatype='...'] [xml:lang='...'] literalText /rdf:Literal would be an alternative form of the production that includes rdf:Description ... and typed elements.  </s>
<s> (The choice of name is just an illustration.) (Note there is no provision for indicating a URI -- maybe there should be.) A variant of this might be to define a new property which identifies its subject with its object; e.g. rdf:sameAs.  </s>
<s> Then one could write: or This requires no change to the syntax, just a new vocabulary element with predefined semantics.  </s>
<s> I think I've illustrated there may be enough ways to solve this problem, and some others, that it is probably best deferred to a new working group with more time to consider the options here.  </s>
<s> And, as Dave says, the current shortcoming is an inconvenience rather than an unavoidable shortcoming.  </s>
