<s> While I am still rather less than pleased by having the PI hack in the XML spec (or rather, having encoding be part of it), I accept that the probability of getting it removed is fairly small.  </s>
<s> So, in the interest of interoperability, I would like to propose a very small change:  </s>
<s> Currently "S" is defined with ideographic space as a component.  </s>
<s> As ideographic space is *not* part of ASCII, I would recommend using a production other than "S" as the separator in the XMLdecl; something limited to just space and tabs (though it will be easy for authors in Japan to make a mistake here, it's probably a reasonable tradeoff).  </s>
<s> I don't quite understand your point.  </s>
<s> Could you give a little more details?  </s>
<s> Makoto  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> We don't want to allow zenkaku space in the header because it will complicate parsing of the header, though this will make it easier for Japanese users to make illegal XML files.  </s>
<s> I have seen many Japanese users accidentally put zenkaku space into places where it was illegal according to the SGML declaration they were using.  </s>
<s> They got many erros that were *hard* for them to understand.  </s>
<s> BTW.  </s>
<s> How is KSP?  </s>
<s> I used to work there a few years ago on the 6th floor...  </s>
