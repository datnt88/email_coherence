This is the usual weekly call for agenda items. 
Suggestions to the list please. 
Brian, I'm happy chairing this week. 
I'll be in Japan during the Nov 14 and Nov 21 calls, where chairing (or even attending -- am investigating) might be a challenge. 
Many thanks to Graham for scribing last week's call (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Oct/0217.html) and to Jan for volunteering for Friday's (Nov 7th) meeting. 
Thanks, Dan If we are short of things to discuss, the I18N comment that is still brewing surfaced here (member only link) I find the Alt argument the most interesting of the things we haven't seen before; it would be interesting to know if the WG would be happy to make the change Martin suggests (no default, all items have equal weight) I understand that they have asked for an extension, so this looks critical path given the good status of the rest of the comments .... 
The other comments either are editorial or the expected substantive comments on XMLLiteral. 
If we have a full agenda we should hold off discussing this comment until it is made. 
Jeremy At this stage of the game, if we choose to make any substantive changes in response to these comments I think they should be simple excisions. 
I could see removing the preference for the first Alt as an excision. 
Or simply removing Alt all together? 
There's nothing special about rdf:Alt that users couldn't define their own vocabulary for it. 
(Personally, I think Alt is rather like the human appendix: of little practical value and a potential source of inflammation.) #g Graham Klyne * Graham Klyne gk@ninebynine.org [2003-11-06 10:41+0000] rdf:Alt is embarrasing junk. 
I all too frequently find myself talking with implementors who are good-heartedly taking our specs at face value and try to use it. 
Wish I'd had the energy to argue against it at a more timely time. 
A deprecatory sentence (in which spec?) might do the job... Dan We already decided not to change RDF containers, I don't see any point doing that further now - it is not a critical change. 
RDF Semantics says on Alt: "things of type rdf:Alt are considered to represent a collection of alternatives, possibly with a preference ordering" -- 3.2.2 http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#Containers RDF Concepts &amp; AS WD says nothing. RDF/XML WD deals with the syntax use only. 
RDF Primer does mention the prefered value rdf:_1 "An Alt container is intended to have at least one member, identified by the property rdf:_1. 
This member is intended to be considered as the default or preferred value. 
Other than the member identified as rdf:_1, the order of the remaining elements is not significant." -- just after http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#example15 
Maybe there is some work to make these a little more aligned. 
Dave Perhaps the simplest clarification that would fix rdf:Alt is to make it clear that it needs to be used with supporting vocabulary, ie. this is a modelling level component of RDF, something that can be used, rather than something down deep in the RDF infrastructure. 
ie. 
I can't write ...and to expect it "just work" by the power of RDF. 
If foaf:Document and rdf:Alt are disjoint (which FOAF could state in OWL) this would be false, since foaf:workplaceHomepage has a range of foaf:Document. 
I guess the best practice guideline is that rdf:Alt is only useful when used alongside RDF vocabulary explicitly created to work with it. 
eg. a foaf:workplaceHomepageAlt property with rdf:Alt as its value would be OK. Would the primer be a natural home for something like this? 
Or maybe just shove it in the ESW wiki...? Dan * Dave Beckett dave.beckett@bristol.ac.uk [2003-11-06 11:09+0000] I'd prefer to deal with actual comments, not hypothetical ones. 
Something like this might come up in an after hours discussion. 
Brian The formal agenda may be slightly late; I am in a telecon that deserves my attention. 
We haven't had many suggestions yet btw. 
Ideas? 
I don't believe it is appropriate to discuss the draft we noticed on the I18N list; let's deal with that when the final version arrives. 
I would also like to use the telecon to solicit RDF Core WG input into discussions on future revisions to the XML Schema WG charter. 
That work is member-confidential and as we work in public I won't go into details here. 
So... the basic shape for tommorrow's call is as last week, very document centric. 
Editors, please try to be up to date w.r.t. your LC2 comment handling and be in a position to summarise any problems or points where WG input is needed. 
thanks, Dan One small agendum. 
I recall that when we discussed the MIME type registration last week, I said we were in good shape and suggested folks look at my message [1]. 
[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Oct/0198.html 
So where from here? 
I suggest: (1) remind folks on the ietf-types list [4] that a revised document is here for review. 
(2) assuming no adverse feedback, request IESG approval for RFC publication. 
Pursuant to that, there is an action suggested by that message, which I'd like to propose: PROPOSED: GK to post note to IETF-types (MIME types registration) list, noting that RDF is now in 2nd last call, and asking for any final comments on the MIME type registration, on the basis that we will request IESG approval and RFC publication as soon as we are happy that all last call comments have been addressed. 
I don't wish to spend time discussing it, unless others feel there's something controversial here.
