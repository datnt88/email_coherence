Not really. 
When I try to enter the code sent back I get a 403, if I use the URI in the email containing the code I get blocked and my password doesn't work. 
Love.

We can't reproduce the bug and don't know how it came up, but suspect it is 
intermittent.

I've reproduced it fairly often! 
Maybe it's the magic code I get back that has set off the "let's gaslight the geezer" paranoia attempt. 
It won't work. 
AaoZcZs4uuL is probably just a bad choice for a code. 
Incidentally it doesn't show up as a misspelled word in my email client! 
Love.
