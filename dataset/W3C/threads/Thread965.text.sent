Hello. 
I need to run HTML Tidy on multiple files (even better, multiple folders within a specified folder). 
I'm on a Win2000 IIS box. 
I've Googled a bit, I've found the following which didn't work: 1. HTML Trim Windows GUI to tidy, supposedly stable and handles multiple files (not subfolders); but doesn't seem to be parsing (or even loading) all the files, and I get 'buffer overrun' if I try to select too many HTML files at once. 2. Tidy UI Can't handle multiple files. 
(and unhelpful Tidy-config interface, btw) 3. DOS batch file Suggested at the Tidy list http://tinyurl.com/vkhn 
and should do it's job well but didn't work for me. 
(no output/error) The solution I'm looking for is: "take this folder, take this tidy.config file, and run over all html files". 
Shouldn't be simple? 
Any help? 
ideas?

Open a command prompt and run `for /?` or `help for`. 
What did you try exactly? 
Well, `for /R %a in (*.html) do tidy -config tidy.config -m %a`... * manuel razzari [Wed, 19/11/2003 at 12:43 -0300] Did you try cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com). 
There is a tidy package and a real shell language (a Unix like indeed). 
Something like : cd thisdirectory for file in *.html do tidy -config thisconfigfile $file cat tmp.err   errorfile done Jany From: manuel razzari killerking@ultimorender.com.ar 
Subject: tidy multiple files on Win/DOS multiple Off-list, I suggested HABit Tidy to Manuel He has informed me that the download file on my site was corrupted so I have re-uploaded the file and checked it. 
Seems OK now. 
Henry Bartlett HABit utilities ( http://www.hotkey.net.au/~hambar/habit/ ) Hello all, Bjoern Hoehrmann's solution worked for me. 
Alternativey, I've just received Henry Bartlett's HABTidy, which can be found here: It works great, does have a checkbox interface to create a standard tidy config file, does multiple files in multiple subfolders, etc. 
For the benefit of fellow googlers and windows-locked desperates like me, I'm also posting a step by step here on using a DOS batch. 
Tidy multiple files and folders on Windows using DOS batch 1. 
On your Windows folder, place tidy.exe and your config file (a .tidy 
file). 
(you place these on your Windows folder so you can run it from any other folder) 2. On your Windows folder, create a text file called tidyall.bat, with the following line in it: for /R %%a in (*.htm*) do tidy -config C:\winnt\xhtml.tidy 
-m %%a (check the path to your .tidy config file according to its name and location of Windows on your system) 3. Open a DOS prompt, go the folder of your HTML files, and run tidyall. 
NOTE: use a DOS-compatible folder to place your html, like "C:\myfiles\" and NOT "c:\documents and settings\myName\etc" because something gets messed up and tidy won't find your files. 
That's it. 
It worked for me. 
Thank you for the list, it seems to me that HTML Trim is the best solution out of the list. 
However, my main concern (which you pointed out) is that it doesn't load all the files.
