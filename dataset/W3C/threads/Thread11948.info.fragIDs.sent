<s> At Judy Brewer's request, I've reviewed the working draft of the AT Guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is a very good start.  </s>
<s> I do have a few suggestions/comments: 1.  </s>
<s> The proposed model suggests continuous monitoring for P1 access requirements and author options for P2 and P3 access options.  </s>
<s> While I agree with this approach personally, professionally and philosophically, I'm concerned that web developers creating corporate, in-house, private, intranet bound or other materials where accessibility considerations are not applicable may find continuous monitoring instrusive and disruptive.  </s>
<s> For those new to web content development and most likely to use WYSIWYG web authoring tools, the frequent prompting likely to be generated by continuous monitoring would likely be confusing and distracting as well.  </s>
<s> What if users could choose the level of accessibility monitoring they wished to employ, (none, some, all) during web page creation but, if the none option was selected, during the first and subsequent page saves,  </s>
<s> the authoring tool review the document for P1 omissions and suggested corrections?  </s>
<s> 2. I found no mention of authoring tools checking for the existence of closed captioning in digital video clips or reminding the user to  </s>
<s> provide such.  </s>
<s> There is a real need to provide an integrated, simple to use and intuitive tool for adding closed caption text in the SAMI, SMIL and Quicktime video formats.  </s>
<s> I'm not certain that web authoring tools would necessarily include this ability, but it is very much needed.  </s>
<s> 3. Perhaps I missed this one.  </s>
<s> Was there a reference to suggesting that the accessibility options be checked for if css2 formats are employed?  </s>
<s> 4. I'm afraid that assuring accessibility considerations will be taken into account by applications which can convert or save documents in html (i.e. Excel, Word, PageMaker) is going to be difficult.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, many institutions do use their wordprocessors to publish web documents.  </s>
<s> Perhaps developers of these applications could be encouraged to include optional checking for P1 access issues during conversion?  </s>
<s> Here in the California community colleges, our Chancellor's Office has recently established a policy that all web based resources, hardware or software purchased with Chancellor's Office grant funding must be accessible.  </s>
<s> OCR here in California is of the opinion that all public education web pages must be accessible.  </s>
<s> It seems only reasonable that our systems of public education here in California would be encouraged to purchase web authoring tools from developers whose products support accessible design.  </s>
<s> Carl Brown, Director High Tech Center Training Unit of the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office  </s>
<s> Programs like Word, Notes, etc, which can be used to generate web content should have the same guidelines applied to them as any other authoring tool, except that they would apply when material is being saved as HTML.  </s>
<s> In other words, saving as HTML should produce a review of the documents as Carl suggested for authoring tools proper.  </s>
<s> Although it may indeed be difficult to convince manufacturers to implement these, we should not  </s>
<s> therefore say OK, it doesn't matter then.  </s>
<s> These programs are being used to generate HTML, look like becoming the greatest culprits in making the web inaccessible, and are increasingly popular because people are already familiar with them.  </s>
<s> If these products are rated as producing inaccessible, then those purchasers who are looking to produce accessible material will create a market pressure for the manufacturers to adopt the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile.  </s>
<s> A very strong section on conversion tools will be included in the guidelines (see the new document this afternoon).  </s>
<s> We are also in the process of evaluating existing software that converts to HTML, and will use the results of the evaluation to highlight problems with existing software, in another forum.  </s>
