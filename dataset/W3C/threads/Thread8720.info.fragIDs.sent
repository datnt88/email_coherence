<s> Since XML and RDF are explicitly designed to do data and resource description, we do not specify much of our own.  </s>
<s> Instead we expect others to design such applications in XML/RDF, over/with which our signatures will orthogonally operate.  </s>
<s> However, we do provide the following element: 5.2 The SignatureProperties Element Additional information items concerning the generation of the signature(s) can be placed in a SignatureProperty element (i.e., date/time stamp or the serial number of cryptographic hardware used in signature generation.) Signature validating applications have no obligation to understand the content within this element, they are only REQUIRED to process core validation [1] with respect to the simple semantic "XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere."  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000208/#def-ValidationCore  </s>
<s> However, this element provides one (of many) places one could place an assertion about a signature, such as a timestamp, hardware profile, or semantic extension.  </s>
<s> For instance, one could assert within a SignatureProperty that the containing signature means "authored by." Again,  </s>
<s> while the signing application should be very careful about what it signs (it  </s>
<s> should understand what is in the SignatureProperty) a receiving application  </s>
<s> has no obligation to understand that semantic (though its parent trust engine may wish to).  </s>
<s> This isn't very well explained in the present spec, though I think the text above does capture the sentiment expressed by the WG. Consequently I propose adding similar text (unless someone thinks I got it wrong, which is a very real possibility.)  </s>
<s> I am a chair of the Signatures Workgroup of legal XML, but this note is simply submitted as my personal comment pending a decision by our group on whether to submit a group position.  </s>
<s> I believe it might be helpful to add an optional element for "other signature data" to the standard.  </s>
<s> At the last RSA Data Security Conference, several vendors independently and in one cases jointly, introduced the concept of a policy manager (not always called by that name), which is a mechanism for adding information to a document to be signed about the authority of the signer to commit an enterprise or other legal or natural person to a transaction.  </s>
<s> Such information does not appear in the ordinary X-509 certificate extensions and is delegated to a policy manager, in my understanding, in order to supplement the X-509 certificate extensions information without having to go to a second round of authority certs.  </s>
<s> By having a convenient placeholder in the standard, this information will conveniently have a tag associated with it, if the applications software employs such a mechanism.  </s>
<s> As I am not on your group's mailing list, I respectfully request you to  </s>
<s> post  </s>
<s> this in the appropriate place.  </s>

<s> In the minutes of the IETF 46 meeting, this same issue came up as "what is equivalent to PKCS-7 Authenticated Attributes in the syntax".  </s>
<s> It was suggested that an example of this should  </s>
<s> be included (presumably in the syntax draft), and none has been yet.  </s>
<s> Since I was the one who suggested an example (passport check), here is  </s>
<s> the ASN.1 for the CMS or PKCS-7 equivalent, neglecting DER sorting and similar issues, and using a hybrid value notation to avoid separate definitions for the types and data here: AuthenticatedAttributes ::= SET { PassportNumber, ChecksMade } PassportNumber ::= SEQUENCE { tempOID OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 3 8232 4127 20000214 1 }, value SET { val1 SEQUENCE { country PrintableString "US", idnumber UTF8String "555" ChecksMade ::= SEQUENCE { tempOID2 OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 3 8232 4127 20000214 2 }, value2 SET { chks BIT STRING { picture(0) TRUE, gender(1) TRUE, approxAge(2) TRUE, eyeColor(3) FALSE }  </s>
<s> I hope the notation is fairly clear.  </s>
<s> The OID root is mine personally,  </s>
