Subject: Re: CSS examples for Braille? 
Is anyone aware of, or is anyone working on, CSS examples that describe the reduction of a text to Braille? 
I think Chris Lilley mentioned something to me along these lines recently. 
(Chris is at the W3C Advisory Commitee meeting in Japan this week, so don't expect a quick answer) 
There was some interest in CSS for Braille at WWW6. 
There is already a placeholder media attribute on the style element, and corresponding @media block in the CSS, for Braille stylesheets. 
The first thing is to gather requirements. 
For example - which Braille? 6-dot or 8-dot ? 
For braillers, or printed books, or both? 
Which level of Braille to generate? 
Are American and British and French and Greek Braille the same and if not, how do you know which one to generate and which one you are reading? 
Having worked that out, writing CSS properties to control alignment (centred, left, right) indent, etc would be fairly straightforward. 
Ways of laying out tables, perhaps using footnote markers in each cell, would be a bit more complex. 
There was also a requirement to synchronise multi-media presentation so you could have, for example, an ACSS stylesheet styling the audio output of an HTML page with the title/URL of links being displayed on a Braille bar as the link text was being spoken. 
I asked at WWW6 for anyone with ideas or requirements on CSS Braille to contact me. 
I didn't get much response so far. 
If the WAI group, who collectively know far more than I do about Braille (I'm just bluffing, actually ;-) and don't read Braille at all) could collect and summarise requirements that would be most valuable.

Jason White knows enough to do us some good, here. 
I am not going to try to recapitulate what he has said of his available level of effort, but it's non-zero. 
We should spend it wisely. 
At the moment, I am interested in having examples, even style-sheet fragments, available. 
Not necessarily a global encyclopaedia of Braille styles. 
In particular, I would like an established legacy dialect of Braille as the target, so as to represent what is fairly established practice. 
In other words, I would be glad to take whatever Jason knows best. 
I want to have concrete examples of the kinds of collapsing transforms that go into a data-compression scheme like this. 
What I remember are the compression of indents and the _selective_ pass-through of italics. 
CSS examples for this established Braille practice would bring home the moral: - for CSS to work the accessibility problem, the class system over which the styles are layered has to have some semantic depth, not just be a 1-1 precursor for visual font effects. 
In general, we are going to have to develop downgrading-by-rule recommended practices for taking documents that have been authored with no thought to any browse mode but the wizziest, and mapping them into less-inflected media in a comprehensible way. 
I want some examples around to make it clear what kind of a beast that downgrading filter is. 
Al Gilman PS: I have added a few unvarnished comments on the ACSS note alongside the action item response in Most of them have nothing to do with accessibility. 
Please take them with more than one grain of salt. 
As Al has indicated, I am interested in the braille style sheet issue. 
I posted a message to the list a few days ago, containing some admittedly preliminary thoughts on possible extensions to the current braille media type proposal. 
Although the formatting possibilities for braille are governed largely by the nature of the medium itself, it would be desirable to consult braille experts from a number of different countries in developing the CSS requirements. 
Formatting conventions differ between countries, and although general controls for spacing, alignment, the representation of emphasized text and so forth would satisfy most requirements, there might be formatting techniques used in other countries that may need to be taken into account. 
I am personally familiar with the English braille system, and also have a book which describes the French contracted code (Abrege Orthographique Francais Etendu). 
There is a tendency for braille producers to conform to strict style guidelines, which are prescribed by the various national braille authorities (unfortunately I don't have a copy of such a document from which to work). 
However, for purposes of CSS, it would be important not only to be able to reproduce existing format conventions as contained in style guides, but also to give the user flexibility in the design of style sheets. 
I would suggest that both refreshable displays and embossed output on paper should be considered when designing the braille CSS specification. 
Thus, commands for controlling the placement of page numbers, running headers and footers, and block protection, might well be appropriate. 
Currently there are very few HTML user agents which translate and format text for braille output. 
One is the Sensus Internet Browser (see transformation Service at the University of Technology in Dresden (http://elvis.inf.tu-dresden.de/html2braille/), 
which is actually a server that retrieves HTML documents via the web, converts them into braille and sends them to the user's client software. 
I understand that the Sensus braille translation system in Denmark uses eight-dot braille (reference my previous message), but I have not had any direct experience with this system. 
I think CSS styles should accommodate both six-dot and eight-dot braille, although the only aspect of formatting that varies depending upon the use of a six or eight-dot system is the number of lines that can fit onto a page of embossed output.

One reference that may be useful in planning the braille style sheet specification is: ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/CAPS/DELIVERABLES/CAPS.PILOT.PHASE/PLAIN_TEXT/oda_sgml.txt 
This is an old document and it does not discuss issues of style sheet design. 
However, it provides a good introduction to British braille formatting conventions through an analysis of the RNIB's style manual, and details the format commands that are available in a particular braille translation programme. 
Incidentally, the Integrated Translation System discussed in this document is, I have been told, no longer being used by RNIB. 
A related document discusses the conversion of SGML material into French literary braille. 
The URL is: ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/CAPS/DELIVERABLES/CAPS.PILOT.PHASE/PLAIN_TEXT/sgml_brl.txt 
Unfortunately, the names of the authors are missing from both of these documents, but they were written as part of the CAPS project which I believe was funded by the European Union's TIDE programme. 
I gave an incorrect URL in my previous message, for which I sincerely apologize. 
The correct URL is: ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/CAPS/DELIVERABLES/CAPS.PILOT.PHASE/PLAIN_TEXT/oda_brl.txt Jason White.
