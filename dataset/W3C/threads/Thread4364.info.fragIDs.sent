<s> XSLT 2.0 section 20.3 says: "If the indent attribute has the value yes, then the html output method may add or remove whitespace as it outputs the result tree, so long as it does not change how an HTML user agent would render the output."  </s>
<s> As I mentioned in a previous message (XSLT 1.1 era) [1], this imposes undue burden on the XSLT processor to anticipate how an HTML user agent "should" (I disagree with the use of the word "would") render the output.  </s>
<s> In order to follow the guideline to the letter, the XSLT processor must be aware of what script (writing system) is in use where the whitespace would be added -- an impossible feat, given the overlap of character repertoires among scripts -- so that it can guess at how the resulting inter-word space would be rendered.  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#h-9.1 for details.  </s>
<s> Along the same lines, I also mentioned: There is some ambiguity [in the HTML spec] about how to determine where an inter-word space needs to be rendered (for example, if it appears on one side of an inline image), so HTML user agents are not entirely consistent in this regard.  </s>
<s> Further, HTML has a different notion than XML of what constitutes "white space" (note the, ahem, space between the words there).  </s>
<s> These are the HTML "white space" characters: #x9 #xA #xC (form feed; disallowed in XML!) #xD #x20 #x200B (zero-width space) ...so you may want to clarify whether the reference to "whitespace" that can be added to HTML output includes those FF and ZWS characters.  </s>
<s> In addition, HTML output rendering is also affected by CSS, scripting, and non-HTML elements and processing instructions.  </s>
<s> These factors should be mentioned.  </s>
<s> Finally, the HTML spec makes various non-normative recommendations of "good practice" for user agents to follow, as mentioned in the third paragraph of HTML 4.01 section 4. Some of these recommendations affect rendering, so you may want to clarify whether they should be taken into account in the determination of how an HTML user agent "should" render the output.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, it would leave less room for interpretation and variance among the output produced by XSLT processors if the guidelines for indenting HTML were changed to something like the following: If the indent attribute has the value yes, then the html output method may add or remove HTML "white space" characters as defined in HTML 4.01 section 9.1 as it outputs the result tree, so long as it does not significantly change how an HTML user agent should render the output.  </s>
<s> The html output method should assume that the user agent will follow the HTML 4.01 recommendations for good practice, and will follow the SGML line break rules mentioned in HTML 4.01 section B.3.1.  </s>
<s> The method should disregard unpredictable rendering factors such as CSS, client-side scripting, and the effects of non-HTML elements and processing instructions.  </s>
<s> It is not recommended that the form feed (#xC) character, which is disallowed in XML, be used for indenting, even though it is allowed in HTML.  </s>
<s> The default value of the indent attribute is yes.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> I think I would like to move (as we have done recently with the XML indenting rules) to a more prescriptive statement of exactly where an HTML indenter may add whitespace, rather than describing it in terms of the effect on visual appearance.  </s>
<s> The rules, I think, are: (a) whitespace must only be added before or after an element, or adjacent to an existing whitespace character (b) whitespace must not be added adjacent to an inline element, the inline elements being those included in the %inline category in the HTML DTD (c) whitespace must not be added inside a formatted element, the formatted elements being pre, script, style, and textarea  </s>
<s> and as you point out, "whitespace" in the above should mean "white space as defined in HTML 4.01 section 9.1.  </s>
<s> Michael Kay  </s>
<s> That sounds good.  </s>
<s> Those are the rules we're following in 4Suite, and they seem to result in safely indented output.  </s>
<s> However, there's one exception in our implementation: since Netscape 4.x wrongly fails to ignore certain instances of whitespace appearing between td and tr tags, we have added 'TD' to the set of inline elments.  </s>
<s> I doubt you really want to mention that exception in the spec, but I was thinking it would be nice to have an annotated version of the spec(s) for implementers and users alike, so people could share knowledge like this.  </s>
<s> Tim Bray's annotated XML spec [1] was, and still is, a huge help to me -- and others, I'm sure.  </s>
<s> I am thinking that a more modern version would work like the very successful PHP docs [2]: split up the spec into separate sections, each with its own little moderated message board below it.  </s>
<s> Hooray! Now I can add all those zero-width spaces and form feeds ;) Mike [1] http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm  </s>
