Bug report Date: August 30, 2003 Version: Amaya 8.0 Amaya has a bug in rendering dynamically generated images. 
If a web author creates a php script that returns one of serveral png images, Amaya will display the first image, but Amaya then caches the image and won't accept any new version that the php script generates. 
For example, take this PHP file: ------------- imgrotate.php 
----------------- ?php 
error_reporting(E_ALL); // Create the list of files to display. 
$imgfiles = array ( 'btnaboutus.png', 'btncontact.png', 
'btnhome.png', 
'btnlogin.png', 
// rot.txt must already exist and be world writable. 
// The file contains only a single number. 
$count = file('rot.txt'); 
$count = (intval($count[0]) + 1) % count($imgfiles); `echo $count  rot.txt`; $file = $imgfiles[$count]; header ('Content-Type: image/png'); header ('Cache-control: no-cache'); header ("X-Debug-Info: count=$count, file=$file"); passthru("cat $file"); ? 
------------- end --------------------- Put the address of this file into the location bar and hit enter to go to the page. 
Each time you click refresh, you get the same image. 
'imgrotate.php,' 
rotates over four png images. 
Because the content is always going to change, caching is disabled in the HTTP header, but that does not disuade Amaya from caching the first file it gets anyway. 
Amaya caches the image even if Amaya's cache is disabled using the 'Settings/Cache...' dialog. 
By the way, the problem goes away when the image file is loaded from another page as part of an IMG tag. 
The bug is only seen when the location bar is used to access the image rotating script. 
Was my bug report received? 
On Sunday 31 August 2003 09:23, Gary Petersen eloquently expounded: On Wed, 3 Sep 2003 03:52:02 -0500 Sorry I probably trough away your previous message by error, due to a lot of spams I receive each day. 
Amaya has a local images cache by document to avoid Web access when the source view and the formatted view of the document are synchronized. 
But I'm not sure, it's the cause of your problem. 
Could you point me to an URI where I can make a real test?
