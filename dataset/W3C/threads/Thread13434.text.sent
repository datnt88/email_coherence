since (according to its introduction) the deadline for the first draft of the ERT is 31 october 1999, are we leaving ourselves enough telecon time to iron out the details in order to complete a comprehensive review of ERT? g.

Good point Gregory that this leaves just one meeting before ERT release. 
folks, Chris expecially, what do you think? 
I'm not available the week of the 11th You'all could meet without me of course that week. 
Also, there's the week of Oct 26, getting to the wire.

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) Len, Welll, I think we may go a bit over our deadline. 
So if you're away for a telecon it shouldn't be a big deal. 
The telecon after that one may be closer to the final close. 
Chris the iron aloha, len! for those of us with UA cross-membership, the 11th and 12th of october aren't viable dates, as the UA face2face is being held on those dates... (and, although it doesn't bisect with our regularly scheduled meetings, the AU face2face is slated for October 7/8) gregory.
