<s> Hi Phill, 1) We used an if - def structure on many of the guidelines to facilitate reading and determination of what applies to a particular author or situation.  </s>

<s> This was done to keep people from overgeneralizing something before they find the clause at the end which limits it.  </s>
<s> 2) The UNTIL form items, follow the same idea.  </s>
<s> That is, they inform the user up front of the limitations of the statement, then make the statement.  </s>
<s> We can look at redoing these but we are reticent to lose the benefit of letting the user know that a statement has a limitation on it up front.  </s>
