5: Review Minutes of 2001-11-09 See: 6: Volume of mail traffic There has been a noticable increase in the volume of mail traffic to the point where some WG members are feeling somewhat overwhelmed. 
Is this a widespread problem? 
What can we do about it?

o The WG notes that the RDF/XML syntax as currently defined is unable to represent an arbritary RDF graph. 
In particular, the RDF/XML syntax cannot fully represent a bNode which is the object of more than one statement. 
o The WG believes that extending the RDF/XML syntax so that it can respresent all RDF graphs is beyond the scope of its current charter and resolves to postpone consideration of this issue. 
o The WG actions the editor of the RDF Syntax WD to include in that document a clear statement of the RDF graph structures that RDF/XML is unable to represent. 
See: 13: Issue: rdfms-assertion Propose: The WG resolves that o the RDF model theory defines the semantics of RDF o it is beyond the scope of this WG to decide on how the laws of different countries should apply to statements made in RDF. 
o this issue be closed. 
See: 14: Issue rdfms-boolean-valued-properties Propose: o The WG notes that rdf:type can be used in place of the rdf:is suggested in this issue. 
Thus, to say that a resource is a chocolateLover, the class ChocolateLover can be defined, and the resource declared to be a member of that class using rdf:type. 
rdf:isNot can be represented by declaring the resource to be a member of the class of NotAChocolateLover, again using rdf:type. 
o The WG resolves to close this issue on the grounds that current definition is adequate. 
See: 15: Issue #rdfms-rdf-names-use Propose the WG o resolves that the use of rdf:Description except as the name of a description element is an error o resolves that the use of rdf:ID, rdf:about, rdf:resource, rdf:bagID, rdf:parseType except as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error o resolves that the use of rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt and rdf:Seq except as typed nodes is an error o resolves that the use of rdf:li as a typed node is an error o resolves that the use of a container membership property (rdf:_nnn) as a typed node is an error o resolves that test case be obsoleted o resolves that a copy of that test case be created as an error test case o actions DaveB to create test cases for the above cases o actions DaveB to identify any similar cases to those above and create test cases to cover them also See: 16: Issue rdfms-aboutEach Propose o the WG resolves to remove rdf:aboutEach from the language on the grounds - it is not used - it is not widely implemented - it has confusing interactions with bagID as recorded in - it prohibits the development of streaming RDF/XML parsers - it requires schema processing in the parser - this is the wrong layer in which to implemenent such functionality o Action DaveB remove from the grammar in the RDF/XML document o Action Brian update the issues list, especially Attention Developers 17: Datatypes Take a straw poll of the WG's views on the various datatype proposals and discuss how to proceed See: 18: Semantics of Reification - what progress This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant fine up to here; these names are purely syntactic, and I'm happy to have their syntax limited this way... I'd prefer not to go there. 
The nice thing about container decisions to date is that rdf:Bag etc. are *not* special syntax; they're just logical constants. 
I can live with it, though. 
yes, please. 
rdf:li is syntax as well. 
Again, please: no. rdf:_nnn is a logical constant, not special syntax. 
yes, please. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to deliver the promised draft of the datatyping document until tomorrow. 
Much of my time was consumed by digesting the exploded email traffic (item 6 on the agenda, thanks for bringing it up) and trying to keep up with the new suggestions and clarifications. 
Let's discuss how to proceed with datatyping after the straw poll tomorrow... Sergey Does it mean that the parser will complain about if used instead of ? 
If not, the wording should be improved. 
Sergey Well, speaking as one who is becoming so peripheral as to become a candidate for last week's request for non-attending members to speak up (How does that item work, anyway? 
Hands up all who aren't here!)... Yes, the maillist is becoming a huge time-consuming effort. 
Brian once advised that those of us with limited time for W3C duties should be selective but the recent flood has been such a monolithic lump, two or three threads but almost all on one extended (and vital) subject, that, frankly, it takes as long to be selective as not. 
Besides, I haven't wanted to miss any of it! 
This sub-group's capacity for never-ending argument and counter-argument has amused, impressed and dismayed me in turns. 
I just don't know how to handle it, personally - as a WG member. 
How can one contribute without adding more centrifugal forces? 
To agree with one viewpoint is to invite a counter-example from the other camp - and always a very valid one. 
I don't sense any gravitational centre upon which these orbiting bodies will eventually converge, one I can add my mass to. 
Many's the time I thought about chipping in (like `Who says shoe sizes are integers anyway?') but have thought better of it - it'd only cause trouble. 
Speaking pragmatically (as an RDF-based-software programmer), I cannot (yet) see a way to justifying expressing a preference and if I did, I can't see it helping to contain the argument. 
(Though Pat's brain dump got very close to clarifying it for me - until it got pulled apart...) Help me out, chaps. 
I honestly think it's been damned impressive but not efficient for this WG member.

Patrick f2f I've been trying to do rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty /test001.rdf 
and would ask some W3C team member to give appropriate access rights and some WG members to review the test case itself which is # Issue rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty: # Is a super/sub-property of a transitive property necessarily transitive?

Improved wording ... OLD: Sergey: New proposed: o resolves that the use of the qname 'rdf:Description' except as the name of a description element is an error o resolves that the use of the qnames 'rdf:ID', 'rdf:about', 'rdf:resource', 'rdf:bagID', 'rdf:parseType' except as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error o resolves that the use of the qnames 'rdf:Bag', 'rdf:Alt' and 'rdf:Seq' except as typed nodes is an error Jeremy Thanks for the improvement. 
I'm happy to accept DanC's suggestion that we should not syntactically restrict the use of rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt and rdf:Seq. 
I also noticed that I'd left out rdf:RDF, rdf:li and rdf:aboutEach from the list of reserved names. 
Did I miss any more; DaveB you have a list somewhere. 
I wonder if we can simplify it all to: o Resolves that the use of qnames rdf:RDF, rdf:ID, rdf:about, rdf:resource, rdf:bagID, rdf:parseType, rdf:aboutEach and rdf:li except as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error. 
We also have the case of names not in the name space. 
Should the parser barf if it meets a property or a typed node like rdf:foo? 
Brian Any reasonable parser will barf. 
It is unlikely that the user intended to write what they did write. 
If the WG decide that this is not permitted then the barf will be an error, otherwise the barf will be a warning.
