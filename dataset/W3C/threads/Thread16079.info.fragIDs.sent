<s> That's certainly true.  </s>

<s> I said that they passed Bobby -- I didn't claim it was absolutely friendly or accessible, just that it passed.  </s>
<s> Now, I believe we should compliment folks who take those baby steps, and encourage them to continue forward; other people, judging from the email I've received, disagree and believe we should demand more and more.  </s>

<s> Feel free to issue whatever blistering criticism of the Microsoft page you like; if you want, you can make fun of me for not checking it against X or Y, or with such-and-such a browser, or for not checking every page on the Microsoft site.  </s>
<s> Have fun!  </s>

<s> While Microsoft does tout their accessibility quite loudly and publically, Kynn does have a good point.  </s>
<s> You can get a heck of a lot more out of an organization like Microsoft by saying "Great job!  </s>
<s> Have you thought about this?" than criticizing this: "Your sorry attempt at making your front page accessible isn't worth it.....try following the standards that you participated in creating."  </s>
<s> Through my own personal experience, I've realized that use of the "blistering criticism" that Kynn mentioned only causes Microsoft to get defensive.  </s>
<s> However, they did make an interesting quote in the media last week:  </s>
<s> '"Standards support is important to a smaller subset of customers," said Jodi Ropert, group product manager for Microsoft's Macintosh business unit.  </s>
<s> "There are more universal needs from a performance and ease-of-use perspective."  </s>
<s> The company said a future version of the browser, planned for next summer, will feature enhanced support for Web standards.'  </s>
