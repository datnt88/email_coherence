<s> As new distributions include the whole documentation, the install probably needs more space.  </s>

<s> If you mean harddisk space, that's not the problem.  </s>
<s> I have several GB free.  </s>
<s> And there is no error message; the installation seems to just "pause" until Outlook is closed.  </s>
