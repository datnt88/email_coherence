<s> Hi, A question has come up in a project that I'm consulting on about whether a group of radio buttons or a selection box is generally more accessible for blind users.  </s>
<s> A problem with radio buttons can be determining which button is selected.  </s>
<s> Also, going through a list of radio buttons can be more time consuming when a blind person is just tabbing.  </s>
<s> Using a selection box seems to avoid these two problems.  </s>
<s> Are there draw backs to a selection box which makes it less desirable than a group of radio buttons?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott  </s>
<s> Scott,  </s>
<s> By selection box I'm guessing what screen readers term a list box where several of the selections are visible and one can cursor through them or a combo box where one choice is presented and the up and down arrow open the list to show more.  </s>
<s> Either of these options is much more desirable than radio buttons in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Screen readers accurately read the pointed to item in both cases and avoid the hit and miss of radio buttons.  </s>
<s> Hi, As a follow up question, which is preferable - a single radio button or a selection list with two options.  </s>
<s> There might be a subtlety here depending on the choices.  </s>
<s> Two different situations are: 1. the choices are boolean, e.g. on/off, yes/no 2. the choices are mutually exclusive, e.g. red/green, male/female Scott  </s>
<s> Hi Scott etal: A few interacting questions need to be asked: a) what degree of "accessible" do you mean?  </s>
<s> Specifically, what do you want someone's screen reader to say?  </s>
<s> The question itself?  </s>
<s> Only the options when using the down arrow?  </s>
<s> Both the question and the option when using the down arrow?  </s>
<s> b) What screen reader(s) are you assuming is(are) being used?  </s>
<s> Which versions?  </s>
<s> c) What browsers are you assuming?  </s>
<s> Which versions?  </s>
<s> d) How do the answers to all the above interact?  </s>
<s> For example if  </s>
<s> a) I want to hear both the option and question each time I hit the down arrow and b) I am using JFW 3.2 and c) I am using Lynx 2.8.1 I find, in order to meet a) above, I need to repeat the question and the option associated with the label as the example below shows.  </s>
<s> Will this work for other screen readers (or versions of the same) or browsers (or other versions) or other forms (perhaps having longer questions)?  </s>

<s> My experience has been that any sort of combo or list box is preferable to either a radio button or check box.  </s>
<s> Screen readers don't always seem to reliably read the text associated with radio buttons and check boxes.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I've also found that navigating a list or combo box is reliably done with the up and down arrow keys, whereas radio buttons sometimes use left and right arrow and other times up and down arrow.  </s>
<s> If I guess wrong, then I may move to another control and have to navigate back to the set of radio buttons.  </s>
<s> Also, some screen readers mistakenly identify checkboxes as radio buttons, apparently because the graphic indicators are not standard.  </s>
<s> Regards, Jamal  </s>
<s> It comes from the form itself.  </s>

<s> Hi, Thanks for the comments on whether radio buttins or a selection/list box is more accessible.  </s>
<s> An interesting aspect to the question is accessible to which disability?  </s>
<s> Interfaces which require a blind person to do more reading or searching might be less accessible or efficient.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, a quadriplegic might prefer a collection of radio buttons since all the choices are presented and the quadriplegic has to do little or nothing to see what choices are available.  </s>
<s> As part of the project I'm working on, we're creating a developer's environment with the goal of the developer's environment being as easily used by blind people as by sighted people.  </s>
<s> While a screen reader may allow a blind person to work with the environment, he/she may not be as effective at doing that as a sighted person.  </s>
<s> In this environment, we are moving away from "accessible" design to more "universal" design.  </s>
<s> For example, if in a house a person in a wheelchair has to go through two additional doors in order to reach light switches which are at wheelchair height, is that a reasonable design even though it might be considered accessible?  </s>
<s> One primitive measure of efficiency being used is how many keystrokes does a blind user have to press, including those for operating the screen reader, in order to perform some function in the developer's environment.  </s>
<s> For example, would using a selection/list box instead of a group of radio buttons reduce the number of keystrokes?  </s>
<s> Because of the target audience of the project, we were able to limit browser selection to those which support javascript.  </s>
<s> (The project does such things as using javascript to parse information stored in xml format.)  </s>
<s> The javascript allows us to create a more universally designed developer's environment which reduces the number of keystrokes needed by blind users performing the same functions as done by sighted people.  </s>
