Given the *current* spec :-), has anybody noticed that you can actually have a locknull resource that does not have any *direct* locks on it? 
For example: Establish a locknull as /a/b with a shared lock. 
Now, lock /a with a Depth: infinity lock, shared. 
Finally, unlock /a/b with the first locktoken. 
Just wanted to mention this to others, as it was pretty unexpected for me... Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/ 
Thanks Greg. 
I've added that scenario to the list of locking issues. 
This isn't perhaps that unexpected. 
If one models the lifecycle of a resource as a finite state machine, then it goes from non-existant (i.e., a reference to resource whose current state is undefined) to lock-null on LOCK. 
More locks leave it in this state. 
It only leaves this state and goes back to non-existant if there are no more locks. 
A PUT moves it from the lock-null state to the existing-resource state, etc. Greg Stein gstein@lyra.org on 11/11/99 07:58:06 PM Subject: locknull resources Given the *current* spec :-), has anybody noticed that you can actually have a locknull resource that does not have any *direct* locks on it?
