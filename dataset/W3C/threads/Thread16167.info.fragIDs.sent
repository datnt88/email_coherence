<s> I call it the "holier than thou" syndrome.  </s>
<s> None of us on this list was born knowing how to build web sites or how to make them accessible.  </s>
<s> All of us who do build sites have come to this relatively late in life (i.e., not in high-school, unless, of course, you still are), often *after* learning how to build sites.  </s>
<s> And all of us are still learning.  </s>

<s> Some of the self-serving signatures alone are enough to make me gag.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, this list can be read, at least in archival form, by anyone.  </s>
<s> Snide comments, in my opinion, are best kept to private transmissions (or better yet, ask yourself what you have to be so snide about).  </s>

<s> So if a site needs work (and show me the site that can't be improved), GENTLY steering designers to material that will aid them to make better sites seems to me much preferable to hurting their feelings with sarcasm or pronouncements about the value (or rather lack thereof) of their sites, made from on high.  </s>
<s> In fact, I can see no use for snide or disparaging comments, whether they are seen by the designer in question or not, other than to boost the ego of the person making the comment.  </s>
<s> Finally, let me add that this type of post usually results in a lot of agreement that snide remarks are bad with the worst offenders being the quickest and loudest in their agreement.  </s>
<s> So, if you are willing to consider this complaint seriously, then I suggest that you first look back through your old posts and ask yourself, What were my intentions in writing this post?  </s>
<s> Did I really, honestly, intend to help, or was I just venting spleen?  </s>
<s> Were my comments positive, supportive, and encouraging?  </s>
<s> How would the other party interpret this?  </s>
<s> You may be surprised by what you find.  </s>
<s> Let me say that in my opinion, some of the most frequent posters are also the worst offenders.  </s>
<s> Not that venting spleen is all that bad, but it should be done in general terms, never picking out specific individuals or sites.  </s>
<s> And I would hate for it to become the focus of this forum.  </s>
<s> Let's keep it to a minimum, I say.  </s>
<s> So, I begin 1999 by encouraging the members of this list to: 1. Try to be honest about how much effort is involved in learning about and applying the principles discussed here.  </s>
<s> Let's not minimize the value of the work that's been done by a lot of people both on and off this list.  </s>
<s> 2. Remember that this is not only about convenience, but about ethics.  </s>
<s> There is a moral underpinning to this effort that should not be minimized solely to avoid causing discomfort to us or our clients.  </s>
<s> 3. Read and reread every post before sending it.  </s>
<s> Ask yourself if you've phrased it in a way that takes into account everyone's feelings.  </s>
<s> Insensitivity helps no-one, including the sender.  </s>
<s> And ask if the post is providing a solution, or simply nitpicking about a problem.  </s>
<s> To end, let me give an example from my own experience, though others have suffered the same fate.  </s>
<s> A few months ago I posted the addresses of a couple of sites I had worked long and hard on to this list asking for comment.  </s>
<s> Now I wanted to know what could be improved, but I also hoped for encouragement and some approval from the list, since I had obviously tried very hard to make the sites accessible.  </s>
<s> Not many people outside of this list appreciate accessibility issues (not many that I know anyway), so this was the one place that I thought others might understand.  </s>
<s> Well, eventually I did get some encouragement, but not much.  </s>
<s> Instead, the first few responses nearly knocked me out of my chair.  </s>
<s> The general tone was very critical, and the general message was, This is all wrong, or That's not the way you do that, or You don't know how to use this attribute, or Why the hell would you do this?  </s>
<s> Not necessarily in so many words, but the tone was quite clear.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but I did not find these replies encouraging at all.  </s>
<s> And not a single reply (until much later) pointed out even one positive thing about the sites.  </s>
<s> Sure, I learned a couple of things, but what a painful way to learn!  </s>
<s> I guarantee you that I will NEVER post another address to this list.  </s>
<s> I'm no glutton for punishment.  </s>
<s> And I've seen others who got similar treatment.  </s>
<s> Also, I've noticed, not a lot of other people seem to be posting sites for review.  </s>
<s> Now I spend more time lurking than participating, and every time I see someone else get bitten, I wince.  </s>
<s> What kind of way is that to teach and discuss accessibility issues?  </s>
<s> I sincerely doubt that I am the only one who has had this type of experience or who has felt this way.  </s>
<s> And while I have had similar experiences with other lists (does the anonymity of the Internet encourage this viciousness?  </s>
<s> Are we willing to say things in email that we would be ashamed to say face to face?), that does not excuse it.  </s>
<s> So, for what's it's worth, that's my opinion at the start of this new year.  </s>

<s> This is why I'd rather praise a site that's getting better (e.g., Microsoft) rather than find ways to label them as "inaccessible."  </s>
