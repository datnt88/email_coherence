<s> And to my delight it doesn't mention "accessibility"!  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Bill, it does mention accessiblity.  </s>
<s> What I meant was that it didn't deal with "Accessibility" in the WAI sense.  </s>
<s> My goal is to emphasize all our activities as "accessibility" with a lower case "a" and the *feel* of her report is in that direction rather than the eternal message that we're about helping out some *other* set of people who are categorizable by their "disability".  </s>
<s> We are all members of one another and *every one of us* is significantly "disabled" until we can play/compose as well as Mozart, etc.  </s>
<s> We are all in this together until the gamma ray burster (or a big comet) hits, and "aCCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE".  </s>
<s> We've got to get over the idea that just because our society still imprisons/sterilizes/murders those who differ isn't any reason to pretend that there's some *they* out there who need *our* help.  </s>
<s> We're all out there and we all gain from this help - even something as "trivial" as an evaluation tool.  </s>
<s> It's not just for blind guys, it's for QA like the piece says.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
