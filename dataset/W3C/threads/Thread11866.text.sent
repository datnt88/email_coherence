Checkpoint 1.2 (produce content conforming to WCAG) is supposed to handle this, since that is a major theme of those guidelines. 
The alternatives we considered were to copy the guidelines entire, which seems redundant (for the same reason that we refer to, rahter than include the content of, the User Agent Guidelines) or to provide a summarised version of them, and we have decided not to do that since knowledge of those guidelines is essential anyway. 
Charles McCN Would it be useful to have a guideline that highlights the need to separate form from content. 
The checkpoints for this guideline could highlight the use of style sheets for sperating style from content. 
It could also directly deal with the accessible authoring practices related to tables and frames. 
It also highlights an important concept of HTML and CSS. 
Example: Guideline X: Allow the author to separate device dependent rendering information from web content Checkpoint X.1: Support the use of style sheets for font size, font face and font styles Checkpoint X.2: Support the use of style sheets for element and document colors Checkpoint X.3: Support the use of style sheets for the spatial layout of web content Checkpoint X.4: Support the use of NOFRAMES Checkpoint X.5: Support style sheets for rendering of generated speech Checkpoint X.6: Support style sheets for audio rendering (volume, pitch..)

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Proposed: Add a cross-reference from checkpoint 4.5 to Guideline 3 of WCAG (Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.). 
4.5 Allow the author to transform presentation markup that is misused to convey structure into structural markup, and to transform presentation markup that is stylistic into style sheet markup.. 
Also, add a similar cross-reference and comment as a technique to checkpoint 2.2.
