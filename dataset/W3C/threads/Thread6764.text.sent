I've been meaning to setup a homepage for the xmlspec stylesheets so that I can, for example, make proper releases. 
I have CVS write access to the W3C site, but I don't feel comfortable making up the URI. 
Can someone on the team name a directory for me, please? 
Perhaps the hierarchy.

Bernard Shaw XML Technology Center | Sun Microsystems, Inc. | Hi Norm, yep, w3.org/spec-prod is too high. 
In general, you would be probably want something like add some more stuff next month/year - it is just a way to be "reasonably sure" that there aren't going to be big collisions in namespace 4 years away...)

Be seeing you, norm Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) But Norm is neither talking about a namespace name nor a single document. 
Go to http://www.w3.org/ and run your mouse over the list of URLs under "W3C A to Z". 
You don't see a single URL with a month number in it, and most of them don't have a year number in it either. 
I would think that's more like the kind of thing he's talking about. 
paul True that the month number doesn't appear there in most things. 
The difference for whether the year is there or not is (roughly) whether the thing started after sometime in 2001, or whether it came from an earlier period when URIs were assigned as word collections (which it is harder to assure will be usefully unique in a few years). 
I didn't mean namespace in the sense of "XML Namespaces" as defined in the spec (the things that start with "key:"), I meant the range of identifiers taht can be provided as URIs on the W3C site. 
I realise he doesn't mean a single document - the single documents would be things like http://www.w3.org/2002/spec-prod/some.xsl (As counter examples, consider the things that do not get into the A-Z list, which tend to have a month number - http://www.w3org/2001/03/earl or On the other hand, I think it would be better if someone with more direct responsibility gave this advice. 
I have copied DanC, as my friendly representative on the W3C management Team and one of the poeple I would ask in Norm's place. 
(Dan, if it isn't you I should ask, sorry in advance).

paul Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Right but the policy changed since the beginning. 
New areas are in the date space: and all of them are W3C Activities. 
Philippe / Paul Grosso pgrosso@arbortext.com was heard to say: www.w3.org/2002/spec-prod is fine by me. 
I figured it'd have a year in it.

Baruch XML Technology Center | Sun Microsystems, Inc. | Getting something in that column generally involves a management decision... often a full, 4-week review by the AC and all that. 
Is that what you're asking for? 
you/we can use pretty much for free. 
Anything else is going to involve negotiation; e.g. you/we could use if you negotiate with the /XML/ owner, i.e. Liam. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ / Dan Connolly connolly@w3.org was heard to say: Done. 
Free is good.
