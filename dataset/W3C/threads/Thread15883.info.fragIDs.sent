<s> Actually, there have been several studies.  </s>
<s> I believe the MS User Interface Guidelines refer to the studies as well.  </s>

<s> The usability requirement on fonts is that the page has to work independent of font changes.  </s>
<s> The individuals who need help from fonts to read the screen know better than you or I what font works for them.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Robert C. Neff said:  </s>
<s> I don't follow this logic.  </s>
<s> Your required target is a set of browsers that will use different fonts and layouts among them regardless of what you set in the HTML.  </s>
<s> So why tie yourself to a font indication in the HTML?  </s>
<s> You can go ahead and use style sheets to address the high end user equipment.  </s>
<s> Your selected font won't show up in some browsers.  </s>
<s> It wasn't going to, anyway, in the ones you have been directed to care about.  </s>
<s> The broad usability of the pages depends on your diligence in making sure that the font ultimately doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> Look at the pages in Lynx and listen to them in pwWebSpeak, and you will have robust pages.  </s>
<s> Then you can decorate to your heart's content, so long as the words and the HTML structure that all browsers do respond to are in order.  </s>
