Has anyone done any studies on the best font to use for people with disabilities or for the general public? 
We are producing a new web site and have not heard of any studies relating to this. 
Also... I have never been a fan of Times New Roman on the web because it can be difficult to read with my astigmatism. 
Also graphic artists can use anti-aliasing to fool the eye. 
I also do not believe (personal opinion) that the studies for written or printed text can be easily transposed to the web environment. 
I am not seeing this type of research. 
Do you know of any? 
I was hoping there was definitive research in this area "font selection on the web" 
Lastly, style sheets are good for an intranet or extranet - not for an internet. 
We have identified our target audience and we are developing for the lowest common "browser" (Microsoft or Netscaep 2) and text based. 
Therefore style sheets are not for us -darn!

Actually, there have been several studies. 
I believe the MS User Interface Guidelines refer to the studies as well. 
I'll look this up.

The usability requirement on fonts is that the page has to work independent of font changes. 
The individuals who need help from fonts to read the screen know better than you or I what font works for them. 
to follow up on what Robert C. Neff said: 
I don't follow this logic. 
Your required target is a set of browsers that will use different fonts and layouts among them regardless of what you set in the HTML. 
So why tie yourself to a font indication in the HTML? 
You can go ahead and use style sheets to address the high end user equipment. 
Your selected font won't show up in some browsers. 
It wasn't going to, anyway, in the ones you have been directed to care about. 
The broad usability of the pages depends on your diligence in making sure that the font ultimately doesn't matter. 
Look at the pages in Lynx and listen to them in pwWebSpeak, and you will have robust pages. 
Then you can decorate to your heart's content, so long as the words and the HTML structure that all browsers do respond to are in order.

Reply to: RE  Useability and font selection Some very interesting work on this question has been done by the Royal National Institute for the Blind's "Tiresias" project and the development of a font for digital TV in the UK. See: - Larry Date: 2/9/98 7:55 PM From: Robert C. Neff

san serf fonts are the usually the best. 
Like arial in ms-windows. 
I wouldn't write off style sheets so fast. 
Remember they are backward compatible. 
So even if people cannot see all the visual formatting in the style sheet, they still have access to the information.
