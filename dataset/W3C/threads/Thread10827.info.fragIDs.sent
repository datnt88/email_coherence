<s> One thing that's hard is the rules about how REs adjacent to PIs are handled.  </s>
<s> David Durand and I independently came up with a good way of dealing with such things  </s>
<s> I've heard about this but never seen it.  </s>
<s> Could you or David or someone please post it to the group?  </s>
<s> In our informal discussions before the advent of the WG, figuring out what to do about RS/RE, without busting our 8879 compliance, was one of the most worrying things.  </s>
<s> My "MGML" parsing system does the following: At any point in the document, the parser knows from the content model whether data can appear.  </s>
<s> If so, all bytes that are not markup are data.  </s>
<s> If not, all white space is ignored, and non-whitespace non-markup is an error.  </s>
<s> This sacrifices some flexibility, but has the immense advantage that you can explain it completely in 40 words to both users and programmers.  </s>
<s> Which is not the case for the SGML rules.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't think this can ever be made 8879-compliant.  </s>
<s> Our goal for XML is something that is crisp and clear as the above, but is also 8879-legal.  </s>
<s> If someone on the group could give us a flash of creativity on this, that would be wonderful.  </s>

<s> Well, from my reading of the SGML Handbook, it seems that RE and RS are not *required* at all.  </s>
<s> If they occur, they are put there by the entity manager.  </s>
<s> In fact, RE and RS are not really even characters per se, they are kind of psuedo-characters (they have a code, and a name, but they aren't real characters).  </s>
<s> Anyway, if we assigned some character codes to them that are guaranteed to never occur in input, then the parser will never even see them (another syntax trick).  </s>
<s> This will, of course, mean that \n and \r will be seen in content, but they could be mapped such that they get converted to a space on input.  </s>
<s> I don't claim to be intimately familiar with all the effects that this will have in terms of markup regognition etc. but it seems to me that this would simplify parsers a great deal, and also get around problems with MIME text type requirements (canonical form) etc.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> For example, consider a file from VM (IBM mainframe OS): VM does not represent record boundaries by characters: instead, it either makes all lines the same length (RECFM F to us ancients), or puts a length prefix in front of each record (RECFM V).  </s>
<s> So RS and RE clearly cannot be characters in the source document; if they show up at all, it is because the entity manager inserted them.  </s>
<s> Same is true on other systems, even though RS looks a lot like linefeed, and RS looks a lot like carriage return, they're not the same thing.  </s>
<s> So all you need do is tell your entity manager that all your files are recordless, and that CR and LF are merely whitespace characters (spacechar) on par with TAB.  </s>
<s> To avoid numeric conflict, you'd want to move either them or RS and RE somewhere else.  </s>
<s> Having done this, you're safe.  </s>
<s> It would be most helpful for the SGML revision to add the ability to turn OFF any delimiter of function character (presumably by setting it to #OFF, or the null string, or some such).  </s>
<s> Then we wouldn't have to go find two unoccupied character codes to assign RS and RE to.  </s>
<s> Such a change would also have the benefit that any other delimiters XML doesn't use (DSO?  </s>
<s> PIO? whatever) could be turned off.  </s>
<s> Why is that important?  </s>
<s> Let's say we ended up not having PIs (just an example!!!): Then our grammar would have no mention of the string " ?",  </s>
<s> so I suppose it would be treated as literal data if it showed up in an XML file.  </s>
<s> Oooooooops, so much for SGML being able to parse XML data.  </s>
<s> But if we could turn off the PIO delimiter, we'd be home free.  </s>
<s> Same argument for various other delimiters we might moot.  </s>
