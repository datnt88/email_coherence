<s> Digestt but not all authentication draft features.  </s>
<s> The authentication features are holding us up, and it is important to have more client implementations.  </s>
<s> This is another plea for implementation reports and/or updates to existing implementation reports, so we can get these specifications to draft standard.  </s>
<s> If we don't have at least 2 interoperable implementations of each feature by, say, the August IETF meeting, we'll have to strongly consider dropping those features from the protocol.  </s>
<s> This is required by IETF rules for draft standard.  </s>
<s> Note we need 2 interoperable implementations of each feature; there is no requirement that these implementations be shipped as product at the time of reporting, or for that matter, ever.  </s>
<s> The point of the requirement is to show that the specification can be independently implemented and that the protocol as specified works.  </s>
<s> We've asked for time at the IETF meeting to discuss any such cases where we don't meet IETF requirements.  </s>
<s> There aren't many more features that need implementation and testing, though Digest authentication is more of a problem than the base specification.  </s>
<s> Data on all reported implementations can be found at: resonably up to date (there is one report I haven't added yet).  </s>
<s> Most reports are public; in general, you should be able to find someone to test features against given the data available on that page.  </s>
<s> Please let me know of any new implementations, or any features that you've tested since your report (I'm willing to update an existing report for new features, rather than require you to fill out the very long form yet again to report a few changes to the status of tested features).  </s>
<s> Thanks again to all who have contributed...  </s>
<s> Your editor (of the base HTTP spec) Jim Gettys  </s>
<s> If someone wants to remind me where the latest digest auth spec lives, I'll have a crack at bringing Apache's digest auth up to speed (if it isn't already - it's not clear to me from the report whether it is, but I could've sworn there were some changes since it was last touched).  </s>
<s> If there's anything else critical Apache can help with, let me know what and I'll see what I can do.  </s>
