Hi, all I just joined the list and have a problem with Amaya. 
My business website looks perfectly fine in either IE5 or Netscape but as soon as I load it up in Amaya it all goes screwy. 
Spacing between cells of a table are completly out of control, p and br tags are intermitently ignored, and a few other problems. 
Amaya did find for me a minor problem of font text here p /font and those I fixed locally, haven't uploaded that fix yet, but Amaya still incorectly displays the page. 
I've tried both the Windows version (98) and Linux versions, and neither shows things properly. 
Here's url to my site for any one who wants to see what I'm talking about: Any help solving this would be great. 
Thanks Ian Christie When the least they could do to you was everything, then the most they could do to you suddenly held no terror. 
-- (Terry Pratchett, Small Gods) Amaya has some bugs in the way it renders HTML, and tables is an area where this is obvious. 
However by and large it renders according to the specifications - which gives results that are different from many versions of Explorer or Netscape. 
As for solutions, there are several approaches. 
One is to submit code patches to fix the bugs. 
An easier approach is to ensure your code is correct (Amaya will help with this), and until the bugs are fixed used a second browser for viewing. 
Note that the use of tables for page layout is explicitly deprecated in HTML 4.0 - I would encourage you to use CSS positioning where possible. 
You will also find that Amaya is very handy for doing thins like making style rules - you could select one of your styled links, create a rule, and not ahve to worry about styling any more of them - leaner cleaner code with no performance hit (I don't know of any stylesheet-capable browser taht cannot link to an external stylesheet).

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Thanks all who answered, I'm still relativly new at making web pages and dodn't know what that main line at the top of the document means. 
I'm glad to have found out what I did wrong :) just didn't search around enough. 
Now one more question, CSS is Cascading Style Sheets right? 
If so, IE5 and Netscape 4.xx don't currently handle that properly right? 
The idea with the way I was designing the pages was with some sort of backwards compatability with older browsers, and also I just don't know right now how to do Style Sheets of any kind. 
:) Obviously from the results of the W3C Validator I failed in that direction too. 
:) So we'll see how things go, and thanks again.

-- (Terry Pratchett, Small Gods) But note that Netscape is somewhat broken in this area, and has a different object model from IE in this area. 
Tables are probably still the only semi-portable way of controlling layout. 
(On the other hand I had reasonable success in re-writing especially as it passes Bobby even with simulated headings and simulated lists.
