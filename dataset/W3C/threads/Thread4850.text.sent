I'm mostly happy to let the structure of use cases emerge as discussion progresses, but I'd like to nip this naming convention involving people's initials in the bud. 
Please pick names/identifiers that are real-life words that would be reasonably meaningful to somebody who's new to the WG. Yes, it's harder, but coming to agreement on terms is the game we're here to play. 
Use of opaque codewords like XY-23 can lead to inter-group efficiencies, but it creates a barrier around the group; it makes it expensive for new people to figure out what we're all talking about. 
Also, naming use cases (and issues and so on) after people is counter the goal of group consensus/endorsement/ownership. 
Each of us should feel free to criticize a use case without giving any signal of attacking a person whatsoever.

intra-group, rather. 
sigh. 
should have stuck to plain english: ... can allow members of the group to type fewer characters when sending mail to other members of the group... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
1. 
I'm taking this as a request for those of us who have submitted use cases to propose new, mnemmonic names for them. 
Yes? 2. At what point will we begin to gather these use cases in a public document, similar to the RDF Core issues list? 
So that refs and concensus can be thus focused.

Well, no, don't double the traffic just to eliminate the initials. 
But please don't rely on the XX-23 names. 
If you use them, include a few other subject words too. 
i.e. don't just say AS-1. 
Say: find stuff about John Smith (AFS-1). 
When we've got at least 2 or 3 that pretty much everybody likes. 
Right now, we have about 72 proposals with varying level of endorsement and criticism. 
We looked at a handful in the telcon and assigned actions; I'd like to see discussion of those cases mature. 
Anybody is welcome to try to do some gathering, but at this early point, there's no guarantee that it'll become the basis of the group's work going forward. 
A recommendation to anybody who tries it: don't try to be exhuastive. 
Pick a few good ones, not all of the ones that have been proposed.
