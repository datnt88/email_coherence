Dear all, My colleagues of SIDAR in Spain, with whom I collaborate whenever I am able to, asked me to notify to all of you that Harvey's Glossary has been translated to Spanish. 
The URL is: I haven't had a chance to read the translation, but I can guarantee Harvey that the translators group is very well qualified smile , and, on top of that, Charles is involved.

Carlos, Please advise your colleagues at SIDAR that the glossary is in a very early draft stage, and we expect it will be changing considerably over the next several months (there is a group of people starting to work on it) and so they should be careful not to assume that it is a completed or official document yet. 
Thanks, Judy

The translation is in fact two thirds based on Recommendation documents, plus a draft of UAAG. 
It is not the tranlsation of the working glossary that we are trying to use for the future versions, but of the original basis - the combined glossaries published by Harvey. 
But it's still useful - not least for translating The specs themselves.
