Cynthia's reputation is such that I don't think she will be hurt if I use her as an example. 
What is this groups "rules" for longish re-posts of email? 
Personally, I would much rather get a one or two sentence description with a URL. 
I am very skeptical of email that does not come from the original source. 
There is no "face validity" to this kind of forwarded message. 
Aside from the fact that Cynthia is well established here, how does the rest of the 
list (or someone new to the list, or someone not on the list that I would like to share this information with) not know that Cynthia has been duped by someone calling himself "Lainey Feingold". 
Without a reply from Mr. Feingold (who might be quite busy -- and does not know me from Adam) what could I do to confirm this story or look into more deeply? 
Feel free to flame me (off the list please) if I am full of it, but I respectfully request that everybody here try to include a URL with ALL 
longish messages -- even if that means fewer posts! Granted, I understand that many press releases DON'T have URLs, and many LISTSERVs are NOT publicly archived, but fortunately, those are the exception. 
The real problem is people who send YOU good -- but non-referenced -- stuff that you feel obligated to share. 
Fight this bad habit as close to the source as you can! Get THEM to send you the source BEFORE passing the info on to someone else. 
Remember -- this IS how email hoaxes and chain letters get their start! 
With the example below, the Trace uaccess-l is archived at URL: since I am not subscribed. 
But in less than five minutes with AltaVista I found this: Not to sound like a REAL jerk, but is five minutes of Cynthia's time (or whoever would post long -- non-original -- stuff like this) really THAT much more valuable than (5 min * X number of people who are interested) of everyone else's time? 
(I realize that five minutes of Cynthia time *is* MUCH more valuable than five minutes of my time, but that is not really my point!) Thank you!

Sent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 1:18 PM Subject: Citibank installs talking ATMs FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND ANNOUNCES NATION'S FIRST "TALKING TOUCH SCREEN ATMS" AT CITIBANK OAKLAND, CA November 9, 1999 - The California Council of the Blind 
announced 
today the installation of pilot "talking" automated teller machines 
("ATMs") 
at five Citibank locations in California. 
The pilot machines are the first 
to 
combine touchscreens with technology that speaks information that sighted users see on the screen. 
Users will hear the on-screen information through headsets to ensure privacy. 
The pilot machines have been installed at the 
following 
Citibank financial centers: 1. Downtown Berkeley - 2323 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, California 2. Downtown San Francisco - 260 California St., San Francisco, California 3. San Carlos - 780 Laurel St., San Carlos, California 4. Los Angeles/Westchester - 8800 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Los Angeles, California 5. West Los Angeles/Rancho Park - 2566 Overland Ave., West Los Angeles, California Don Brown, the California Council's Berkeley chapter President, praised 
the 
new machines: "Citibank's machine is tremendous - it allows me for the first time to do a variety of banking transactions unassisted. 
This is a great step toward making access to banking services a reality for people who are blind or vision impaired." 
The pilot machines have been installed pursuant to an agreement reached 
in 
July between Citibank and the California Council of the Blind and members 
of 
the blind community, who approached Citibank to discuss how the company's ATMs could be programmed to communicate audibly with blind and low vision consumers. 
Lawyers for the blind community in these discussions were Linda M. 
Dardarian 
of the Oakland law firm of Saperstein, Goldstein, Demchak &amp; Baller, Berkeley disability rights lawyer Elaine B. Feingold, and the Berkeley-based Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.

since you posted this publicly, I feel obliged to put out the other side of the coin. 
Some Email programs will not allow easily cutting 
and skimming of urls. 
Some people cannot access the sites where some of the stuff is archived and five minutes for you translates into perhaps 5 hours for someone with one finger.

This message addresses several recent questions on WAI Interest Group Netiquette. 
Netiquette for this list is available on the WAI Interest Group home page, under "how to use this list" or http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist . 
We periodically update this section to capture additional guidance which seems needed. 
To minimize list traffic discussion on list netiquette, if you have comments on this message, please comment to me at jbrewer@w3.org. 
There is no ban on forwarded or lengthy postings, however, please bear in mind two things: - for news articles, it is better to send URL's when available, due to copyright considerations; - the heavier &amp; wordier the traffic on this list, the fewer people stay on the list. 
A recent question on list usage regarded whether to strip out all parts of a preceding message that one was not directly responding to. 
Previous discussions have shown that carrying forward at least a little context from previous parts of the thread helps some people to understand a message. 
This isn't a rule, but is what some people say they prefer. 
A reminder also not to cross-post to this list when sending messages to a group of addresses. 
It can result in unexpected replies back to the whole list from non-list members if they use a group reply. 
Finally, since the topic of list archives is mentioned below, a reminder that this list is available both as an archive http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig and also as a digest http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist .
