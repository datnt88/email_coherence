<s> To minimize list traffic discussion on list netiquette, if you have comments on this message, please comment to me at jbrewer@w3.org.  </s>
<s> There is no ban on forwarded or lengthy postings, however, please bear in mind two things: - for news articles, it is better to send URL's when available, due to copyright considerations; - the heavier &amp; wordier the traffic on this list, the fewer people stay on the list.  </s>
<s> A recent question on list usage regarded whether to strip out all parts of a preceding message that one was not directly responding to.  </s>
<s> Previous discussions have shown that carrying forward at least a little context from previous parts of the thread helps some people to understand a message.  </s>
<s> This isn't a rule, but is what some people say they prefer.  </s>
<s> A reminder also not to cross-post to this list when sending messages to a group of addresses.  </s>
<s> It can result in unexpected replies back to the whole list from non-list members if they use a group reply.  </s>
