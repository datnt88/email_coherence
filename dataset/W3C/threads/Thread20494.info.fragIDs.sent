The first cvs.html page explains how to get Amaya from the CVS repository. 
The second Autoconf.html page explains how to compile Amaya on Unix platforms. 
There is also a third Win-Compiling.html page which explains how to compile Amaya on Windows platforms. 
At the end the cvs.html page there is a section "Configuring and Compiling Amaya" that points to Autoconf.html and Win-Compiling.html pages. 
It might be a bug in my version of Mozilla (build 2002022203/WinXP), to make 
sure, could someone follow this procedure: 1. Navigate to http://www.w3.org/Amaya/. 
2. Click the CVS link in the navigation column. 
3. Scroll to "Configure and compile libwww". 
4. Click "compile Amaya" which links to 5. Click "Unix compiling section" (no change occurs). 
I have recreated this in Mozilla multiple times. 
The first word is already different, the titles differ, I see a lot of differences. 
Or do you indicate that the knowledge edplained in there is the same? 
Then also compare the tiny details. 
The autoconf page is for stable releases where the cvs page is for development versions.

This is wild. 
I'm running Netscape 4.something on Solaris. 
Follow Brant's instructions and it says it has loaded 100% in the status bar and nothing else happens. 
So I did a View/Document Source. 
It showed the 
source for the page I was supposed to see. 
Try to use Help/About to learn the version of Netscape I'm running and end up on a Netscape.com website (I hate that feature). 
Hit the Back button. 
It now displays the page that should have appeared when I clicked on "Configure and compile libwww".

I think I found the problem: cvs.html links to http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist#Installation 
This should be http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html#Installation 
The link works in IE, but since Mozilla is more standards compliant, it may 
actually be doing the correct thing. 
If I get around to it, I will download 
a new build and try again.

They look fine for me in IE6/XP and Moz 2002022703/XP. 
Only problem I see on http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html is on line 172, where there is an unclosed strong element. 
No problems with the Autoconf.html 
page. 
On the http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist page, there are a elements with no attributes at lines 88 (around "ftp Europe or US") and 151 (around the word MIT) Maybe you've got a bad Mozilla build?

The redirection of SourceDist to SourceDist.html is done by the server so I don't understand why Mozilla is not able to follow both links. 
It works with Amaya too. 
The link works until the page BUT THE TARGET IS NOT ON THE PAGE! 
Either remove the "Installation"-target from the link or add a target to the page. 
A close look on the target page tells me there is a "Installing"-target... BTW: does the validator on the w3c site check for this minor problems?

After re-reading of this page I found these instructions not clear. 
Configure and compile libwww should refer to the next section "Configuring and Compiling Amaya" which explains how to proceed on Unix and Windows platforms. 
I also pointed to the right mailing list www-amaya-dev@w3.org 
No it only checks that pages exist. 
Mozilla IS able to follow both links - if one doesn't have a 2002-02-22 build. 
There was a link-following bug in that build of Mozilla. 
Such is the nature of alpha software. 
Search for "content negotiation" on the Apache website if you want to understand why the URI doesn't need the extension.
