<s> The first cvs.html page explains how to get Amaya from the CVS repository.  </s>
<s> The second Autoconf.html page explains how to compile Amaya on Unix platforms.  </s>
<s> There is also a third Win-Compiling.html page which explains how to compile Amaya on Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> At the end the cvs.html page there is a section "Configuring and Compiling Amaya" that points to Autoconf.html and Win-Compiling.html pages.  </s>
<s> It might be a bug in my version of Mozilla (build 2002022203/WinXP), to make  </s>
<s> sure, could someone follow this procedure: 1. Navigate to http://www.w3.org/Amaya/.  </s>
<s> 2. Click the CVS link in the navigation column.  </s>
<s> 3. Scroll to "Configure and compile libwww".  </s>
<s> 4. Click "compile Amaya" which links to 5. Click "Unix compiling section" (no change occurs).  </s>
<s> I have recreated this in Mozilla multiple times.  </s>
<s> The first word is already different, the titles differ, I see a lot of differences.  </s>
<s> Or do you indicate that the knowledge edplained in there is the same?  </s>
<s> Then also compare the tiny details.  </s>
<s> The autoconf page is for stable releases where the cvs page is for development versions.  </s>

<s> Follow Brant's instructions and it says it has loaded 100% in the status bar and nothing else happens.  </s>
<s> So I did a View/Document Source.  </s>
<s> It showed the  </s>

<s> Try to use Help/About to learn the version of Netscape I'm running and end up on a Netscape.com website (I hate that feature).  </s>
<s> Hit the Back button.  </s>
<s> It now displays the page that should have appeared when I clicked on "Configure and compile libwww".  </s>

<s> This should be http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html#Installation  </s>
<s> The link works in IE, but since Mozilla is more standards compliant, it may  </s>

<s> If I get around to it, I will download  </s>

<s> On the http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist page, there are a elements with no attributes at lines 88 (around "ftp Europe or US") and 151 (around the word MIT) Maybe you've got a bad Mozilla build?  </s>

<s> The redirection of SourceDist to SourceDist.html is done by the server so I don't understand why Mozilla is not able to follow both links.  </s>
<s> It works with Amaya too.  </s>
<s> The link works until the page BUT THE TARGET IS NOT ON THE PAGE!  </s>
<s> Either remove the "Installation"-target from the link or add a target to the page.  </s>
<s> A close look on the target page tells me there is a "Installing"-target... BTW: does the validator on the w3c site check for this minor problems?  </s>

<s> After re-reading of this page I found these instructions not clear.  </s>
<s> Configure and compile libwww should refer to the next section "Configuring and Compiling Amaya" which explains how to proceed on Unix and Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> I also pointed to the right mailing list www-amaya-dev@w3.org  </s>
<s> No it only checks that pages exist.  </s>
<s> Mozilla IS able to follow both links - if one doesn't have a 2002-02-22 build.  </s>
<s> There was a link-following bug in that build of Mozilla.  </s>
<s> Such is the nature of alpha software.  </s>
<s> Search for "content negotiation" on the Apache website if you want to understand why the URI doesn't need the extension.  </s>
