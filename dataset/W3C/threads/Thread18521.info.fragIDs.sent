Hello, 
I've published the 9 March UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]. 
Changes are online [3] and quoted as text below. 
Please review this draft! 
I *strongly* encourage you to review this draft of the document. 
We have resolved all of our last call issues and I don't anticipate any other major changes to the document 
(unless your review reveals significant problems). 
The Working Group agree in the next couple of weeks that we are done and wish to advance to last call (after which I get to prepare the document for our third last call). 
Important things to review 1) Please review addition to checkpoint 4.5 about playing audio during fast advance/reverse. 
2) Please review checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, 4.15. 
I rely on the expertise of the group to get the wording of these speech requirements right. 
3) Please review the first 7 checkpoints of Guideline 9; I think they look great! 
4) Please compare 9.2 and 9.7 and see whether the difference is sufficiently clear. 
5) Please check out definitions of animation, enabled element, interactive element, and focus. 
6) Pleae review checkpoint 2.4 (new wording and new alert requirement). 
7) Check out the new section on how to refer to this document. 
What's next? 
* Add executive summary 
* Address concern about "contradictory" statements of checkpoints 1.1/1.2 * Al Gilman may have some suggestions for us about issue 464 [4] (How to account for captions in SMIL). 
* Now that we have resolved last call issues, I must respond to all last call reviewers to see whether they are satisfied or wish to register objections. 
* The Techniques document needs to be read! 
* The implementation report needs to be updated. 
I predict that we now have requirements for which we have no implementation experience, and we will need to concentrate on these during Candidate Recommendation (if we need to go to CR). Trivia By the way, for those keeping score at home, this is the fifty-fifth (55) draft of the Guidelines. 
Let's stop (at Rec) when we hit 60. Cheers, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/ [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010309/ [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20010309 [4] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#464 
Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 CHANGES General * Editorial: General substitution of "Allow the user to configure the user agent to" to "Allow configuration to" * Editorial: Global substitution of "active element" with "enabled 
element". 
Introduction of term "Interactive element". 
* Editorial: Some changes based on comments from Aaron Leventhal. 
In particular, changed "must" to "needs to" in a number of places (e.g., guidelines prose, techniques) to avoid impression that required for conformance. 
Introduction * 1.3 (Known limitations): Added a limitation that there is no requirement in this document for all user interface components to be under final user control; this is covered to a large extent in Guideline 5 and also in other software guidelines. 
Guidelines * Guideline 4 split into Guidelines 4 and 5. Moved checkpoints about control of UI behavior to new Guideline 5. * Guideline 5 split into Guidelines 6 and 7. Checkpoints * 2.4: Checkpoint wording changed per 1-2 March face-to-face. 
Added alert requirement as well. 
Please review. 
( issue 460). 
* 2.5: Changed from "allow the user to specify" to "allow the user to configure or control". 
* 3.2: Content type "Animation", not "Image". 
But leave video as well. 
* 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7: Changed "video and animations" to "animations (including video and animated images)" per proposal from Ian adopted at 8 March teleconf. 
* 4.5: Important Based on discussion at 1-2 March face-to-face, added the following statement: "The user agent is not required to play synchronized audio during fast advance or reverse of animations (though doing so may help orient the user)." 
* 4.13, 4.14, 4.15: Important These are derived from one single checkpoint per 1-2 March face-to-face resolution. 
These checkpoints need review! 
(Didn't do much to move techniques around yet.) 
* 5.1, 5.2, 5.3: Changed per proposal from Ian, adopted at 8 March teleconf. 
* 6.5: (Editorial) Selection and focus are no longer part of "UI controls". 
* 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7: Now form a coherent content-focus navigation model (among viewports and among enabled elements and among history). 
Changed per proposal from Ian (adopted at 8 March teleconf) in conjunction with resolutions 
from 1-2 March face-to-face. 
* 9.1: Removed this Note: "Navigation among all viewports implies at least allowing the user to cycle through all viewports." 
* 9.2, 9.7: Based on comments from Aaron Leventhal, attempt at making the differences between these two checkpoints more apparent (note that the first sentence is the same in both, but the other two differ). 
* 9.8: Clarification about where the default search starting point should be (when user has not indicated). 
Based on resolution from 1-2 March face-to-face. 
* 10.7: No longer talks about current viewport; instead viewport with current focus. 
Changed per proposal from Ian (adopted at 8 March teleconf). 
* 11.4: Browser history is not required, so history stage change bindings moved to "if supported" section. 
* 12.2, 12.5: Edits to Notes based on comments from Harvey Bingham. 
Conformance * Applicability: Added some comments about event bubbling to third applicability provision. 
* 3.5 Responsibility for Claims: Changed wording from "anyone may make a claim" to "this spec imposes no restrictions about who may make a claim". 
* 3.1 (Content type labels): Made some adjustments based on definition of Animation that includes Video and Animated Images. 
In particular: Animated images are part of animation, not images. 
The goal was to have video/image/animation conformance overlap as little as possible. 
Also adjusted Speech label based on two new speech checkpoints. 
Glossary 
* New term: "Animation" (per 8 March discussion. 
* New term: "Enabled element" 
* New term: "Interactive element" 
* Deleted term: "active element" * Deleted term: "current viewport" * Per 1-2 March face-to-face, changes to the terms "focus" 
(content focus and user interface focus), "selection", "point of 
regard". 
* "Event handlers": Added "An event handler is 'explicitly associated with an element' when the event handler is associated with a particular element through markup or the DOM." References * New section "How to refer to this document". 
Distinguishes this version from latest version. 
Gives sample HTML markup. 
* Added [SMIL20] * Fixed some cross-linking bugs between Guidelines and Techniques pointed out by Harvey Bingham. 
Techniques * 2.7: Added some examples of "required" conditional content. 
* 3.5: Added technique to configure-content refresh based on CMN example. 
* 4.4, 4.5: Added some techniques for doing this in SMIL 2.0. 
Added some info about applicability and streaming. 
Added techniques pointing to digital talking books information. 
* 5.1, 5.2: Some techniques added. 
* 5.5: Suggest warning user that some fee mechanisms may not be "caught" in this configuration. 
Added per 1-2 March face-to-face resolution. 
* 6.1: Added rationale about advantage of access to source content to ATs (rather than offscreen access). 
* 9.9: Added some comments about where important information is identified from (e.g., specs, metadata). 
* 12.3: Added a technique to document where UA diverges from system conventions. 
Thanks Ian, Jon 
Following are a few comments: 
EH: It is not obvious to me that checkpoint 4.15 (user defined extensions re: speech) expresses a clear minimum requirement. 
Seems to need refinement. 
EH: I think that these are really important improvements.... 
EH: Maybe OK... 
EH: Enabled element entry is out of order. 
Re: Enabled it is not clear who or what is doing the 'choosing'.... 
Is it the user or the user agent or the state of the interaction causes it to be chosen? 
Also, if it can happen through an API then other programs can do it. 
Why not remove the parentheses? 
Also since it must happen during a session, it could not be enabled through prior configuration.... right? 
Old: Enabled element, disabled element, An enabled element is a piece of content that is subject to user activation through the user interface (or indirectly through an API) at a chosen moment during the user's session. 
The set of elements that a user agent enables is generally derived from, but is not limited to, the set of interactive 
elements defined by implemented markup languages.

New: ? 
Enabled element, disabled element [REMOVED COMMA] 
An enabled element is a piece of content that is subject to user activation through the user interface or indirectly through an API at a chosen[???] moment during the user's session. 
The set of elements that a user agent enables is generally derived from, but is not limited to, the set of interactive elements defined by implemented markup languages. 
... 
Focus Can the first sentence be made more precise (at most, at least, etc.)? 
"When several viewports coexist, each may have one content focus and one 
user interface focus. 
At all times, only one viewport's content focus or one 
user interface focus receives input events; this is called the current 
focus." New [????????]: "When several viewports coexist, each may have AT MOST one content focus and 
AT MOST one user interface focus. 
At all times, AT MOST only one viewport's 
content focus or one user interface focus receives input events; this is 
called the current focus." 
Comment: Are these definitions incompatible with braille output viewport... 
Just checking robustness. 
Old: "For very general references to this document (where stability of content, anchors, etc. is not required), " New: "For very general references to this document (where stability of content, anchors, etc.,[ADD COMMA] is not required), " 
EH: See separate memo. 
EH: Very good suggestion by Aaron Leventhal. 
EH: Good. 
EH: Seems OK... I assume that it was thoroughly discussed. 
EH: Not sure what this comment means. 
EH: Good. 
EH: See my earlier comment about 4.15. 
EH: Does confirming a prompt meet the definition of 'on demand'? 
Just not sure may be OK (checkpoint 5.3). 
EH: Differences are really hard to spot. 
But I don't know if it is worth trying to clarify. 
Probably OK. 
EH: For checkpoint 9.8, the idea of the 'alert' seems like only half the requirement. 
Do we mean to say the the person should have a choice about whether to terminate or continue the search wrap that is about to occur? 
Also, if one wants to terminate the search, what should happen to the focus/selection? 
Seems it should be made explicit... 
Old: 9.8 Allow the user to search within rendered text content for a sequence of characters from the document character set. 
Allow the user to start a forward search (in document order) from any selected or focused location in content. 
When there is a match (1) move the viewport so that the matched text content is within it, and (2) allow the user to search for the next instance of the text from the location of the match. 
Alert the user when there is no match. 
If the search wraps back to the beginning of content, alert the user prior to wrapping. 
Provide a case-insensitive search option for text in scripts (i.e., writing systems) where case is significant. 
[Priority 2] Note: If the user has not indicated a start position for the search, the search should start from the beginning of content. 
Use operating environments conventions for indicating the result of a search (e.g., selection or content focus). 
A wrapping search is one that restarts automatically at the beginning of content once the end of content has been reached. 
EH: Cool checkpoint...! 
EH: Good. 
Eric, Thank you for comments. 
I've snipped out points of agreement. 
My comments preceded by IJ:. 
IJ: I think we will need a little bit more work on these checkpoints. 
Refer to related proposals/comments: On terminology used Suggestion from Al for more precise wording for 4.14: I think we should try to do for all three what Al suggested for 4.14. 
IJ: Fixed. 
IJ: I have adopted your proposal. 
IJ: I have adopted your proposal. 
IJ: I will let a reviewer with more experience using a braille viewport comment. 
IJ: Ok. 
IJ: Thank you for getting the ball rolling. 
I expect to be able to spend some time on the summary this week. 
IJ: Sorry, this was kind of cryptic. 
Because the definition of "animation" includes "video", I was wondering whether animation/video/image content type labels should all refer to mutually exclusive sets of checkpoints. 
In the end, for 3.2, I thought it best to leave two content type labels: Animtion (for animated images), Video. 
In general, I have been wondering whether animated images should fall under the "Animation" label or the "Image" label or both. 
I think that I prefer just under Animation given the nature of the requirements (and the document reflects that). 
Comments are welcome. 
IJ: Yes, it is supposed to (the user selects "yes", which is an option known to the UA). 
IJ: I think that we limited our requirement to "alert" because the issue was simply not knowing that you had wrapped. 
I don't think it's as important a requirement to not wrap. 
We haven't discussed what happens when a search terminates. 
Do you have any proposals? 
I'm not sure we need to say anything.

EH: Not sure what "this" in last sentence means. 
I am still having trouble wrapping my mind around it. 
Is "it" a 'content focus or user interface focus that receives input focus is called the current focus.' Do you mean 'For any given viewport, at most only one focus -- either content focus or user interface focus -- can receive input events.' Maybe I am just fishing, trying to understand. 
it is customary to provide the user with feedback on this otherly, you need a failure to find more indicator or an explicit wrap modality. 
As I understand the document, the requirement sets an if condition such that if you employ a wrap, notify the user but doesn't talk about what should be done if a wrap is not employed.Something to think about then is to cover that situation with a message to indicate search termination if at end of string matches. 
In other words, after the last string is found, the next attempt if it is set up in this way provides a termination without match condition informant. 
Of course, one technique for getting around this would be to find all matches and present them in a contextual list such that they could stepped through and examined in context. 
Thoughts?
