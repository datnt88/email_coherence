<s> Subject: Standard Posted on NISO Website Hi All -- NISO has posted the Z39.86-2002 DTB standard on their website, in HTML and PDF formats.  </s>
<s> It is also available for purchase in print form for $99 (although the print version won't be available for several weeks).  </s>
<s> It is listed as the last standard in NISO's chronological list of approved and published standards at www.niso.org/standards/index.html.  </s>
<s> Currently, there is no capability to list HTML versions, since ours is the first offered by NISO in that format, so click on the "Z39.86 Resources" link on that page to access the HTML.  </s>
<s> They will be adding a properly-labeled link for the HTML version shortly.  </s>
<s> The direct urls for the two formats are: www.niso.org/standards/resources/z3986-2002.html www.niso.org/standards/resources/z3986-2002.pdf  </s>
<s> As the Maintenance Agency for Z39.86 (responsible for coordinating updates and corrections to the standard), the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress will host supplementary information about the standard and its use on its website at www.loc.gov/nls/z3986.  </s>
<s> (The old url www.loc.gov/nls/niso will also work.) Current versions of all the DTDs contained in the standard, background on their development, and a number of documents created during development of the standard are posted there.  </s>

<s> I have been assessing FrontPage 2002 in regards to accessibility and have found when its functionality such as the wbe components and FrontPage includes are used, the rendered code is not HTML compliant.  </s>
<s> Here is a web authoring tool that is a market leader and easily usable by mom and pop or small operations to build slick websites with great functionality.  </s>
<s> I have run across many churches that use this and professional organizations because it works well in a shared environment.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the rendered code is not even closely complaint.  </s>
<s> Cheers, rob  </s>
<s> Hi Robert: We use the FrontPage Include Component on just about every page on this site: http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/ and have no problem getting it to validate against the HTML 4.01 transitional spec.  </s>

<s> Hi Kathleen, you are up early this Saturday morning.  </s>
<s> Oops you are on eastern time smile .  </s>
<s> Interesting point and I will relook at that.  </s>
<s> The issues I am seeing are how novice people set up and use frontpage to work for them, more specifically the web components.  </s>
<s> I can point uou to church sites that allow lay people to drop documents into the folder and it gets posted.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately these methods do not get rendered properly and fail validation miserably.  </s>
<s> These methods are allowed under frontpage.  </s>
<s> I would think these things would be seemless.  </s>
<s> These are the web sites that are being highly used by a large cottage population.  </s>
<s> I have another personal beef with frontpage.  </s>
<s> On the box it states asp is supported, however, in the preview the content for the active server page includes are not rendered.  </s>
<s> Unless someone know different, here is the code for the include: I have to go to take another step to make see this by going to the web server if you have XP or Windows 2000 Pro where it may not render properly or ftp to the test server.  </s>
<s> These may be issues for the authoring group so my apologies if I have over stayed my welcome here.  </s>
<s> Plus I think its how the authoring tools view the rendered code - not sure.  </s>
<s> Would like to hear how other tools like macromedia and adobe handle includes and special functionality.  </s>
<s> Remember, Frontpage does provide great functionality if you use the server extensions and I really like this.  </s>
<s> This is a great way for the web to be used by more people at home and small businesses.  </s>
<s> I do not like the problems with rendered code or the lack of viewing.  </s>
<s> So I am being negative on a good product because it falls short in two areas - otherwise it's a great tool for someone in a small business who cannot afford all the development tools and THEIR constant upgrades and the configuration management tools to manage file corrections.  </s>
