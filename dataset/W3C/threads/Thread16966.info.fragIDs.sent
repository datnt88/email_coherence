anyone aware why onfocus belongs to a yet onmouseover is img ? 
seems kind of hard to insist that these are matched events, when they apply to different things. 
someone out there must think there is a great reason for this. 
thanks jonathan 
onfocus didn't belong to a in draft versions of HTML 4.01; it might have 
been added at the last minute. 
onmouseover does belong to a in the same draft; it is listed in the %events; entity. 
onfocus belongs to controls because the Windows concept of focus relates to their ability to accept input. 
onmouseover is probably used for images because they are not controls, and because it is relates to a specific visual mode of access, which the standard Windows 9x user interface model considers not to create focus, although the standard model for some X window managers do consider it to create a level of focus, although possibly only at the window, not the control, level. 
The CSS equivalent of onmouseover, :hover, certainly works on a elements.

I think this is an odd argument, when Windows Internet Explorer can have (almost?) any element recieve focus. 
You can even add it to the tab order to obtain keyboard focus by adding a tabindex. 
So if the reason was based on Windows behaviour, it's rather odd conclusion. 
Still onmouseover does exist for A, and so does onfocus, you can just use the A one in all browsers I know of which allow you to use the img one (and more in fact.) Jim.
