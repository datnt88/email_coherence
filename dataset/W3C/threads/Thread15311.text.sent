4.1 Alternate 2 In thinking about 4.1, a major problem we identified was existing content. 
If we are asking companies to take a list of criteria such as "one idea per sentence" and review all of the content on their site, it could take them years. 
Even Trace would fail this since we would never find the time to read all of the thousands of pages to see if there is one idea per sentence. 
(Even if we decided we won't come change anything, we wouldn't have the time to even look at each sentence in order to comply with 4.1. 
In addition, much of the stuff cannot be changed for historical, legal, and archival reasons.) Now, how about if we focused instead on new material and revised material? 
I'm not sure how to word this. 
Perhaps it would look like: 4.1 You will have successfully complied with 4.1 at the minimum level. 
If you have reviewed all recently generated or updated materials with the following in mind. 
That's a grand idea. 
I would like to propose that we follow that with each file must show the date generated and dates on the accessibility statement should exist. 
That would be the only fair way to identify old pages versus new pages. 
This would mean they date could not be generated as the current date unless that is an accurate representation. 
So, to do the date we should include perhaps the following text: "File created on: mm dd yyyy" Lee Behalf Of Gregg Vanderheiden 4.1 Alternate 2 In thinking about 4.1, a major problem we identified was existing content.

I have several concerns in response to this proposal. 
1. 
We agreed in the past that issues of time/expense wouldn't be taken into account in specifying checkpoints and success criteria. 
This proposal appears to contradict that understanding. 
Also, it could set an unfortunate precedent, leading to erosion of the level of accessibility provided for by the guidelines as items which people think might involve expenditure of time and effort are shifted to levels 2 or 3. 2. One of the reasons for not including time/effort considerations in the analysis of requirements is that these are relative to the circumstances of the developer, including the available tools, the amount of content involved, and the resources that can be committed to the accessibility effort. 
Thus a review under checkpoint 4.1 might consist of automated checking via text analysis tools, with manual investigation and, if necessary, correction of those sentences or passages highlighted by the software as possibly in need of human attention. 
Lisa mentioned last week that she was already developing such tools (not testing tools stricto sensu, but rather tools to assist human evaluators). 
Of course, if a content developer sets a policy of only reviewing new or revised content, then there are two options: either don't assert conformance to the guidelines until the entire content has been reviewed/revised, or restrict the scope of the conformance claim only to those parts of the content that have been reviewed (i.e., exclude older content from the scope of the conformance claim). 
3. Other parts of the guidelines will require review of the content anyway, by a combination of human judgment and automated checking, and it isn't obvious that 4.1 will create much additional work in this respect, especially as tools become available to assist the process. 
4. I am also concerned that proponents of access for people with cognitive disabilities would find any such limitation of checkpoint 4.1 unacceptable, and would charge that the guidelines aren't giving due attention to cognitive issues. 
I suggest that we shouldn't restrict the scope of 4.1 to "new" or "revised" content. 
After all, the conformance scheme is sufficiently flexible that a developer can simply confine the scope of the entire conformance claim, and I don't think we should impose restrictions on 4.1 that we aren't prepared to apply to the whole document. 
More specifically, I am not persuaded that there is a case for treating 4.1 differently from any of the other checkpoints in this regard. 
I think we should exclude any content that is not created or controlled by the web site owners. 
For example, email archives, and customer testimonials, quotes - but I think the concept of "review" takes that into consideration. 
- we could clarified this in the preamble. 
However in terms of legacy pages the burden of reediting old work holds true for valid markup, unique decodable, and dependent technologies. 
All of these guidelines can be completely impractical to retrofit on fast amount of problematic pages. 
Most WCAG 01 Single A compliant sites are written in invalid HTML. 
Many would have to be pulled down and redone from scratch to compile to WCAG 02 A. Perhaps it makes more sense for people could conform to WCAG 01 for their legacy pages and WCAG 02 for new content.

Hmmmm I don't think we can do that exactly. 
It leaves a great big OEM loophole. 
That is, I just create a site and subcontract content. 
Now it doesn't need to be accessible. 
Or rather, it meets accessibility guidelines even though the content doesn't..... 
I see where you are trying to get to. 
And that may be the direction of an answer. 
But we need to be very careful.
