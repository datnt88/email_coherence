hi everyone i'm just marking up a document with several occurences of asterisks after words in data table cells which lead to a brief explanation or additional info that couldn't fit into the data cell but is placed underneath the table (a footnote basically). 
i was wondering how to make that accessible. 
should i put an abbr or acronym tag or span/title around the asterisk and put the explanantion in there? 
what if the explanation is really long, won't that be confusing. 
also, it would be repetitive, since the user would then come across it twice, because it's still underneath the table for the sighted users. 
it would basically get read out twice by a screenreader. 
with references at the bottom of documents i normally link to the reference and then from there back to the text, but that seems a bit overkill here. 
and confusing again. 
or maybe i should put title="additional info after table" in a tag around it. 
what would be the best and least confusing solution? 
thanks iris the page in question is at http://www.demos.ac.uk/project/docs/0103.html 
i'm not finished marking it up yet. the data tables are further down the page (in grey). 
Send a cool gift with your E-Card Iris, I think an asterisk is good only when you have a single (foot)note on a page. 
When you have more than one, I'd suggest you number them, or use symbolic names as the W3C does in its standards. 
It would probably also help to link the footnotes back to their references. 
I'd put the notes themselves simply at the bottom of the page then - unless the explanation is *very* short. 
A list of notes can itself be interesting to read and warrant a link from a table of contents on the page.

If these are in fact glossary references (it sounds like it) then a link is a good idea.Especially if that is made clear by including the attribute rel="glossary" in the link. 
a link is fairly low cost, and is explicit, and works everywhere. 
If you add some type nformation to it viarel you can do cool stuff, whereas with an asterisk or similar there is no explicit encoding. 
This is about getting the semantics explicit so that even computeres can follow them... Cheers Charles Iris, I think an asterisk is good only when you have a single (foot)note on a page.

no, they are not glossary terms. 
no, i didn't write the content and don't want to change it too much since it's an academic research paper. 
there are several tables of courses on this page, title of course, length of course and attendance. 
there's an asterisk next to some course titles and a note below the table ('this course was run in liaison with...'), which means several items refer to this note. 
i can't put it with the references at the bottom of the page because linking back wouldn't be possible (several items). 
it would all become clear if you had a look at the page: maybe i'm overdoing it a bit, trying to get this accessible? 
iris is a after additional table and long, would the screenreader. 
reference here. 
around Send a cool gift with your E-Card Why not put the explanation of the * just before the table - in a quick look it seemed that it meant the same thing inside each table. 
(in this table * indicates Blah blah blah) Marti they of a means the link snip the accessible. 
asterisk user for fantastic! 
i can't believe we didn't come up with this ealier. 
see, my main interest is in making it less confusing for screenreader users. 
jumping around in the text is confusing, especially for such a bagatelle. 
this is a really good solution. 
thank you sooo much. 
thanks for all the other input too iris look Send a cool gift with your E-Card Having looked at the table I see you have two different notes (but only two). 
You could perhaps use superscript A and M instead of the asterisk as that would be more mnemonic. 
If I were hearing the page I think it would be easier to remember A for Access Summit than * means Access Summit.

A service of First Bite of the Apple Go back links are undesirable anyway, as they result in recursion of the page on the history stack. 
On the other hand, the browser back button ought to do exactly what you need here, allowing multiple references to the same note.
