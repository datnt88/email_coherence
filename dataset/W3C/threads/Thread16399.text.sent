I've lost my notes on this -- can someone tell me which browsers/ screenreaders/etc do anything with LONGDESC?

Hello everyone, I'm writing a substantial article and recommendation for accessible content authoring for online media services. 
As well as covering existing standards, software and devices, I would like to get people thinking about the future of accessibility today. 
This way, we can keep an eye on development and let vendors know our requirements. 
I'm looking for any suggestions, especially in the area of authoring tools. 
What features can we give HTML editors (for example) to make them: 1. 
Output more accessible code and 2. make the applications themselves accessible to impaired users. 
Quick thoughts of my own on point 1 - having a 'structural' mode, which doesn't allow any "display tags", such as font . 
For example, the EM emphasis structure tag is allowed, but I Italic, is not. 
this will encourage the use of stylesheets, and aid in the transition to a full XML environment. 
Word processors are particularly bad at outputting HTML that is full of very specific font tags. 
Visual editors often use complex tables for layout. 
these Apps should have modes which disable visual formatting, and strip HTML to structure + stylesheet. 
Point 2 - simply have the software prompt the user for ALT, TITLE and LONGDESC tags for images and links. 
this should speed up authoring by not requiring manual selection of fields which are often hard to get to, because sighted designers rarely use them. 
This feature would also encourage sighted designers to consider Accessibility, because it becomes less of a chore. 
Maybe it could be extended further, with a database of title and ALT tags which are associated with regularly used URLs or images files for automatic insertion. 
That's just a start, I'm sure there is much to add. 
Thanks, David Sheehy on behalf of RPH Australia David, Getting authoring tools to support production of accessible content is indeed an important way to ensure that there is more accessible content on the Web. 
That is why W3C/WAI developed, with input from many organizations and individuals, the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (ATAG) http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG which were released as a W3C Recommendation on February 3, 2000. 
You might want to visit the ATAG press release http://www.w3.org/2000/02/ATAG-PressRelease and the testimonials and fact sheet that are linked from the release. 
There are currently a number of authoring tool developers working on implementations of ATAG.
