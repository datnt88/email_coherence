Dear Erez, I want to bring this issue up. 
Arabic, Hebrew and other languages are wrriten from right to left. 
While The latest HTML draft does not have a special tag to specify the direction and takes left to right as the default direction of the language. 
I don't think that the transfer protocol (HTTP) has anything to do with rendering the HTML document itself. 
So, you'd better resend this mail to the HTML working group.

Information Engineering Course Dear sirs, I want to bring this issue up. 
Arabic, Hebrew and other languages are wrriten from right to left. 
While The latest HTML draft does not have a special tag to specify the direction and takes left to right as the default direction of the language. 
I think it is about time that such a tag (property) will be defined. 
The suggestion is to add a property called Language with the following features: 1. Direction - The direction from which the language is wrriten. 
2. Default font - The default font for that language as in the OS (such as Windows 95) installation. 
3. Wrap - Direction of wrraping according to the dominent language. 
So that if we combine Arabic/Hebrew with English in the same sentence, which is most common we can write: The wrapping issue is also very important and should be concidered with the "Dominent" language in which the HTML document was wrriten. 
I would like to get your commenct on these important issues.

This is indeed a HTML issue, not an HTTP issue. 
And it has been addressed already. 
Please see RFC 2070!
