<s> WAI IG CALL FOR REVIEW: WCAG CURRICULUM We welcome your comments and suggestions on the draft Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Curriculum, which Chuck Letourneau of Starling Access, and Geoff Freed of WGBH NCAM, have been developing as part of the Education and Outreach Working Group's activities.  </s>
<s> The draft curriculum is available at http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/ .  </s>
<s> We expect the on-line Curriculum to be used in three different ways: 1. by a trainer teaching in a classroom situation; 2. by an individual doing self-study; and 3. by an individual doing research on a particular topic (guideline, checkpoint, etc.) The following questions are from Chuck Letourneau.  </s>
<s> If you decide to review the curriculum (and this is an important way to give input into WAI materials) please send your replies to the Education &amp; Outreach Working Group mailing list, at w3c-wai-eo@w3.org (rather than filling up the interest group list), by next Friday, June 18.  </s>
<s> Thank you! - Judy Review Questions: In general, we would appreciate it if you could evaluate the curriculum and comment based on your experience using one or more of the above modes.  </s>
<s> In the first two cases, does the curriculum work as a teaching or learning tool?  </s>
<s> In the third case, does each example (or set of examples) adequately explain or illustrate the concepts and techniques suggested by the Guidelines and Checkpoints?  </s>
<s> Specifically, if you notice spelling, typographic or grammatical errors, please let us know.  </s>
<s> Also needed are reports of bugs or discrepancies between what we think is supposed to be happening on a slide and what you actually perceive.  </s>
<s> To help the authors identify specific problems, it is crucial that we get the following information with your comments: 1.  </s>
<s> What browser were you using?  </s>
<s> 2. What version of the browser?  </s>
<s> 3. What platform (Mac, PC, etc.) and operating system?  </s>
<s> 4. What assistive technology?  </s>
<s> Many of the difficulties people have encountered to date are browser or platform specific.  </s>
<s> Having this information will help the authors resolve (or at least isolate) the problems.  </s>
<s> Of course, if you have a suggestion for how to correct any problem you detect, please provide it.  </s>
<s> We would also appreciate getting some real-world examples for the following: Example for Checkpoint 7.3 - When a page includes moving content, provide a mechanism within a script or applet to allow users to freeze motion or updates.  </s>
<s> Using style sheets with scripting to create movement allows users to turn off or override the effect more easily.  </s>
<s> Any idea of how to show this?  </s>
<s> Example for Checkpoint 8.1 - Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly accessible or compatible with assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Anybody have good simple (public-domain) example of an accessible script or applet that we could include on this slide?  </s>
<s> Example for Checkpoint 9.2 - Ensure that any element that has its own interface can be operated in a device-independent manner.  </s>
<s> Something like a Java program that is also accessible might be nice.  </s>
<s> Or is anyone aware of any accessible plug-in apps that we could use as an example?  </s>
<s> Example for Checkpoint 11.3 - Provide information so that users may receive documents according to their preferences.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint refers to content negotiation and we don't have an example for that.  </s>
<s> Can anyone help?  </s>
<s> Again, please send your replies to the Education &amp; Outreach Working Group mailing list w3c-wai-eo@w3.org , by next Friday, June 18, and include information on browser, version, platform, and any assistive technology that you were using with these.  </s>

<s> Why does this have to be reviewed so quickly?  </s>
<s> One week turn around is too quick  </s>
<s> to do an adequate review.  </s>
<s> It will almost take me that long to find the right people in education to review this.  </s>
<s> _I_ will try to review it and send comments  </s>
<s> by next Friday.  </s>
<s> But, I will also ask others, hopefully some folks experienced  </s>
<s> in creating and delivering curriculum, to try to meet the requested date, but I  </s>
<s> would like to be able to still send in comments AFTER next Friday.  </s>
<s> In general I  </s>
<s> would like to ask for a minimum of 2 weeks for review cycles.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> Phill, Comments after next Friday are also very welcome.  </s>
<s> But comments received by the 18th will have more chance of making it into the updated version that Chuck &amp; Geoff produce before Chuck heads off on the road for several weeks.  </s>
<s> Comments that don't make it in before he leaves will get addressed when he's back.  </s>
<s> The curriculum is under a more flexible process than the guidelines, which went through Last Call, Proposed Recommendation, and then were released as a Recommendation.  </s>
<s> In general, we'll be trying to give at least one week's "heads-up" about upcoming reviews, even where a two-week review is not possible.  </s>
<s> The "heads-up" and the slightly longer review planned for this curriculum disappeared because of some things on my end on this round.  </s>
<s> It may take us a few tries to get a smoother review process in place.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I look forward to comments from your reviewers whenever they come, and appreciate your taking the effort to get others at IBM involved in reviewing WAI work.  </s>
<s> I encourage others in the WAI Interest Group to similarly get involved in reviewing materials.  </s>
