Hi Stefano and Simile folks, Sorry I missed this, better late than never tho ... 
If I understood you correctly, you are suggesting that we identify 'concepts' with URIs that do not contain anything to do with the actual literal that is used to describe them in a particular context. 
So, something like instead of is that correct? 
Stefano. 
I think using a numbering scheme to build a URI for a concept is generally a 
better idea, as it helps to emphasise the fact that that resource being identified is a piece of meaning, which is distinct from any lexical or symbolic labels. 
It also makes the URI scheme language independent (handy for politically sensitive multilingual projects :) However it is by no means necessary to do so. 
But, if you are going to use the preferred label for a concept as part of the URI for that concept, you must be absolutely clear about the fact that that URI is an identifier for the concept itself, and NOT the specific label. 
To put it another way, you must be clear about whether a URI such as is (a) an identifier for the lexical string 'maternity services' or (b) an 
identifier for a concept whose preferred label is the string 'maternity services', whose alternative label is the string 'blah' and whose scope note is 'blah blah blah'. 
If this distinction is not made clearly, then everyone gets very confused when you want to make statements such as 'concept A from thesaurus T is broader in meaning than concept B from thesaurus U' and 'the preferred label for concept A is identical to an alternative label for concept B'. 
Just as an interesting sort of aside ... the first statement above is an example of what I would call a 'semantic mapping', the second statement an example of what I would call a 'lexical mapping'. 
What's interesting is that lexical mappings can be discovered by a computer alone, using stemming algorithms and string comparisons etc. 
The lexical mappings can then be 
used to highlight possible semantic mappings, and defining semantic mappings is something that only a person can do. 
Another example of a lexical mapping would be 'the preferred label for concept A is the plural form of the preferred label for concept B'. 
Another (the most obvious) example of a semantic mapping would be 'concept A is identical in meaning to concept B' (which could easily occur even if their respective preferred labels where not identical). 
The SKOS-Mapping schema [1] was designed to take care of semantic mappings. 
But is there a requirement for expressing lexical mappings in RDF, and if so, how do we do it without getting rather confused? 
The reason why I previously didn't think expressing lexical mappings in RDF 
was really necessary was because they could be automatically discovered by a 
computer process at any time. 
But then I guess storing and publishing the 
results of that process could be useful, especially when operating on large 
data sets. 
Anyway, it would be great to get some feedback on this question. 
Yours, Alistair.

Hi Alistair First better warn you unfortunately I'm not working on SIMILE, but I'll 
explain my position here, as I did do a bit of the work on lexical mapping 
mappings.

I think we do need to do this, in fact I think this is related to our previous discussion on giving URIs to altLabels? 
Automated discovery doesn't quite work in the way you describe, because the computer will generate lexical mappings, but then anywhere between 10% and 50% of them are incorrect. 
So you need some way of capturing them, and reviewing them by hand if necessary. 
Does that seem sensible?

Hi Mark, good to hear from you. 
Yes I was thinking of this when I made these comments. 
(I have some ideas about how to express lexical mappings that does not require the altLabels to have their own URI.) 
Yes absolutely. 
Could you possibly provide me with a list of all the types of useful lexical mapping you can think of? 
This is splitting hairs a little bit, but I think it would be more accurate to say that a lexical mapping may or may not reflect a close semantic mapping. 
So a lexical mapping is never 'incorrect' if it captures some sort of lexical similarity between labels, even if there is no semantic mapping between the corresponding concepts. 
(This is just my attempt to make a very clear distinction between the world 
of lexical comparison of character strings, and the world of semantic comparison of intended meaning.) Yours, Alistair. 
Hi Alistair 
I have some ideas about how to express lexical mappings that does not require the altLabels to have their own URI. 
I would be interested to hear your proposals here? 
Here is the use case we had in SIMILE: I have some Artstor data that uses the term "cadavers" (which is a preferred term in the Artstor data), and I want to map onto the LOC TGM thesaurus. 
In 
LOC TGM, cadavers is an alternative term for both "dead animals" and "dead 
persons". 
Therefore, my guess is LOC decided that the term "cadavers" was ambiguous, so they decided to encourage cataloguers to use the two less 
ambiguous terms. 
However here the concept corresponding to cadaver is 
actually the union of the concepts that have "dead animals" and "dead 
persons" as their primary terms. 
So if I want to create a mapping between the Artstor data and the LOC TGM, how should I do it using SKOS for the record that uses the term "cadavers"? 
I think I want a semantic mapping here, even though I am mapping to an 
alternative term? 
As well as the use case above, I think there are a number of other things 
that seem difficult due to not giving altLabels their own URIs - perhaps you also have workarounds for them? 
- how can you provide versions of an altLabel in multiple languages? 
- lots of web APIs (for example fetch, the Longwell and Brownsauce browsers) 
use URIs to identify objects. 
Is there a way of identifying altLabels that 
is compatible with these APIs? 
BTW, I did discuss with Damian Steer, and he pointed out the multiple 
language problem could be solved using bNodes. 
This doesn't help the web API 
problem, but FOAF uses bNodes in a similar way, so some web APIs are coming up with ways to solve the problem for the FOAF case, so perhaps an alternative solution might be to use a bNode? 
We used edit distance measures, so taking this approach "fountains" and "mountains" are as close as "corpse" and "corpses". 
I was thinking of the first one as being "incorrect" whereas the second one is "correct". 
Now conceptually you are right that they are both correct lexical mappings. 
So maybe what I am actually doing is generating lexical mappings, then human reviewing them to turn them into semantic mappings, only the change from lexical mappings to semantic mapping is not explicit (because I don't fancy doing lots of retyping by change the property names in the N3!) This is a pragmatic approach for now - longer term, I think SIMILE intends to develop tools to do this type of task, so then it might be possible to change the properties so they actually reflect when a mapping relation is changed from being just a lexical mapping to a semantic mapping. 
No, sorry. 
I guess people like the WordNet and Cyc communities have thought about this, and you may be more familiar with this work than I am? best regards Dr Mark H. Butler Research Scientist, HP Labs Bristol 
Hi Mark, 
So taking this as an example, using the following hypothetical RDF descriptions of the concepts involved ... ... using the most recent version of the SKOS-Mapping schema [1][2] the Artstor - LOCTGM mapping would be expressed as ... ... and the LOCTGM - Artstor mapping would be expressed as ... This is of course a semantic mapping, and needs a person to identify it. 
Some sort of mapping tool is what I had in mind as a UI, to help a user 
define semantic mappings (possibly suggested by lexical mappings). 
As a totally hypothetical example, I was thinking that lexical mappings could be expressed as in e.g. .... 
I would love to see another round of development on the SKOS-Mapping schema (I think it needs it), with some proper test cases to try it out. 
I don't think we have this effort left in SWAD-E though, something to think of for the future :).

Hi Mark, In reply to this question ... 
This needs careful analysis. 
The effort in SKOS has been to be utterly clear about which nodes in the graph represent a piece of meaning (concept), and which represent lexical or symbolic labels. 
So it is entirely reasonable to say something like ... ... but to say something like ... ... would break the whole model, because what does the "c" node represent? 
The only reasonable interpretation is that it is a piece of meaning, because the only thing that connects the two strings is their received meaning. 
And so we now have a concept as the value for a labelling property!!! 
The correct (first) example above uses the 'multilingual labelling approach' (see [1]), which is essentially the rough and ready way of doing multilingual thesauri. 
To be more precise about modelling these sorts of structures, one needs to take the 'interlingual mapping approach' as in e.g. Note that the mapping statement does not necessarily follow from the fact that 'chats' is the usual french translation of the english word 'cats'. 
If I added the statement ... ... it would become obvious that the mapping statement is in fact entirely incorrect - that what the "a" node actually intends is something completely different from the concept of the furry things that purr. 
Anyway, hope this helps :) Yours, 
Alistair.
