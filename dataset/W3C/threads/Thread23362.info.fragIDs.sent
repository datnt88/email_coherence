<s> Right, you could do what getweb does, and search for one of a set of end tokens.  </s>
<s> The most important end token to search for is the standard rfc signature delimiter, which is two dashes: on a line all by itself.  </s>
<s> See my signature on the bottom, for example.  </s>
<s> I also look for the word "end", as well as a bunch of other silly things like "" and other strange things I saw over the course of several months running a server.  </s>
<s> You might want to copy the same set of strings from getweb.  </s>
