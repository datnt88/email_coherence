<s> This is an excerpt from a chapter I wrote on accommodating people with disabilities in web-based training programs, to be published later this year.  </s>
<s> I present it to stimulate discussion on how we might organize the "Functional and Technical Requirements" document.  </s>
<s> Alan A primer on disability What is disability?  </s>
<s> People are not "disabled."  </s>
<s> A disability is a consequence of design flaws  </s>
<s> in the environment.  </s>
<s> Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting.  </s>
<s> When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said  </s>
<s> to have a disability.  </s>
<s> Barriers People with disabilities face barriers that prevent them from realizing their full potential.  </s>
<s> Barriers may be physical, architectural, cultural, political, informational, or attitudinal.  </s>
<s> For people with disabilities in computer-based training programs, barriers frequently are due to poor planning or design.  </s>
<s> For example: 1.  </s>
<s> Most operating systems and software applications include poorly-designed features that compromise usability for people with certain disabilities.  </s>
<s> 2. Cyberspace is increasingly multi-media.  </s>
<s> This characteristic works to the advantage of people with disabilities who might not otherwise be able to perceive everything on a site.  </s>
<s> However, if web designers provide information in only one format (e.g., images without accompanying text), or optimize a site for one particular browser, some people may be unable to access all important information.  </s>
<s> 3. Access barriers result when web-designers do not consider all intended users.  </s>
<s> Making an accessible site is a matter of adhering to simple design principles.  </s>
<s> Functional limitations In addition to the barriers posed by poor design and planning, a person's functional limitations may make it physically hard to operate a keyboard or mouse, read a monitor or printout, or use other peripheral devices.  </s>
<s> Consider the functional limitations associated with seven different kinds of disability, and the effects of these limitations on an individual's ability to operate a computer: Visual impairments Visual impairments range from slightly reduced visual acuity to total blindness.  </s>
<s> A person with reduced visual acuity may have trouble reading the screen or distinguishing foreground text from background pattern on a web-page.  </s>
<s> People with more severe impairments rely on technologies that translate displayed text into synthesized speech, audible cues, or Braille.  </s>
<s> Hearing impairments Hearing impairments include problems distinguishing certain frequencies, sounds or words, ringing in the ears, and total deafness.  </s>
<s> A computer user who is hard of hearing or deaf may miss audible prompts, or not hear music and speech that are conveyed through the PC loudspeakers.  </s>
<s> Mobility impairments Mobility impairments include minor difficulties moving or coordinating a part of the body, muscle weakness, tremors, and in extreme cases, paralysis in one or more parts of the body.  </s>
<s> Mobility impairments can be congenital, such as Muscular Dystrophy; or acquired, such as tendinitis.  </s>
<s> Computer users who have upper-body mobility impairments may be unable to manipulate a mouse, press two keys on the keyboard simultaneously, or reach certain areas of a keyboard.  </s>
<s> Others may tend to hit several keys at once, or press keys inadvertently.  </s>
<s> Cognitive impairments Cognitive disabilities affect an individual's ability to think and reason.  </s>
<s> They are caused by genetic factors (e.g., Downs Syndrome), exposure to environmental toxins (as in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome), brain trauma, and psychiatric conditions.  </s>
<s> Cognitive impairments include memory loss, perceptual difficulties, and inability to concentrate.  </s>
<s> A person whose memory has been adversely affected by, say, a head injury, may be unable to recall the function of an icon or the menu on which a frequently-used command appears.  </s>
<s> Learning disabilities People with learning disabilities have average or above-average intelligence, but the ways they take in information, retain it, and express knowledge are affected.  </s>
<s> Learning disabilities affect reading comprehension, spelling, the mechanics of writing, manual dexterity, math computation, problem solving, processing speed, and the ability to organize space and manage time.  </s>
<s> Students in web-based training programs who have learning disabilities may have trouble reading or understanding printed materials, picking out pertinent information on a busy computer screen, or using a keyboard or mouse.  </s>
<s> Seizure disorders People with certain kinds of epilepsy may have seizures when exposed to a monitor that refreshes or a cursor that flashes at particular frequencies, or to sounds that repeat at certain rates.  </s>
<s> Speech impairments Speech difficulties do not usually affect one's ability to use a computer.  </s>
<s> In the future, speech impairments might affect computer use if voice input technologies become more usable, or if telephone and PC applications become fully integrated.  </s>
<s> Accommodations for people with disabilities Accommodations are bridges for overcoming design flaws in the environment and individual functional limitations.  </s>
<s> Accommodation is the process of modifying the environment to meet the needs of individuals who have difficulties performing tasks that many (perhaps most) other people can do.  </s>
<s> Accommodation involves removing or minimizing the adverse effects of barriers in the natural and human environments.  </s>
<s> These barriers prevent individuals with disabilities from achieving personal, educational, vocational and recreational goals.  </s>
<s> There are many ways to accommodate an individual in the home, workplace, library or classroom, including low-tech devices, spatial reorganization, work station modifications and building modifications (See Cantor 1996, 1998a).  </s>
<s> In computer-based training programs, most accommodations are likely to be adaptive hardware and software.  </s>
<s> Adaptive technologies for computer-based training programs Thousands of hardware and software products are available that allow people to overcome design flaws in the environment and their functional limitations.  </s>
<s> Adaptive technologies fall into two broad categories: input devices and techniques, and output hardware and software.  </s>
<s> Input devices and techniques - Modified keyboards.  </s>
<s> Miniature and enlarged keyboards; on-screen keyboards operated by switches, eye blinks, puff-and-sip devices, or a mouse; adjustable and split keyboards.  </s>
<s> - Mouse alternatives.  </s>
<s> Touch pads, track balls, and graphic tablets.  </s>
<s> - Mouse emulators.  </s>
<s> Software that modifies the keyboard so that the numeric keypad (or other keys) can be used to move and click the mouse.  </s>
<s> - Keyboard-only techniques.  </s>
<s> Methods for operating a PC using keyboard shortcuts and equivalents instead of a mouse.  </s>
<s> - Speech recognition systems.  </s>
<s> Software and hardware for entering text or issuing commands by voice.  </s>
<s> - Keyboard and mouse utilities.  </s>
<s> Software for adjusting the sensitivity and behaviour of the keyboard or mouse.  </s>
<s> - Word prediction and word completion software.  </s>
<s> Keystroke-saving programs that generate a list of words (or expressions) in response to typing one or more letters.  </s>
<s> For example, typing "wo" displays a menu that includes "word," "word prediction," "work," and "would."  </s>
<s> The user selects the desired item from the menu by pressing a key or clicking the mouse.  </s>
<s> - Abbreviation expansion software.  </s>
<s> Programs that instantly translate pre-defined codes into words or expressions.  </s>
<s> For example, typing "AES" yields "Abbreviation Expansion Software." - Macro software.  </s>
<s> Programs that record a series of commands or keystrokes, and replay them by pressing a key or clicking the mouse.  </s>
<s> Output hardware and software - Display properties utilities.  </s>
<s> Software that alters the size, colour and contrast of information on the screen.  </s>
<s> - Text-to-speech systems.  </s>
<s> Hardware and software that convert information displayed on the monitor into synthesized speech.  </s>
<s> - Text-to-Braille systems.  </s>
<s> Hardware and software that convert information displayed on the monitor to Braille, either through a special printer or a refreshable display.  </s>
<s> - Visual warning utilities.  </s>
<s> Software that converts auditory prompts into visual cues.  </s>
<s> Each person's accommodation needs are unique, and the variations, even among people having similar functional limitations, are great.  </s>
<s> The most reliable way to determine an individual's accommodation needs is to ask.  </s>
<s> Assume that the person with a disability is the expert on his or her accommodation requirements.  </s>
<s> I agree that disability is frequently a mismatch between a person and the environment.  </s>
<s> I also notice that mouse users are usually non-typists.  </s>
<s> Computer programmers are not usually typists.  </s>
<s> They find the mouse easier than learning good touch typing.  </s>
<s> Hence they design the interface for their touch typing disability.  </s>
<s> Norman  </s>
<s> It is a trivial issue, but there is a very large group of computer programmers (probably larger as a proportion than among general users) who prefer to use a command line (keyboard-based) environment than a 'point-and-click' User Interface).  </s>
<s> However it would be a fair observation that the proportion of these people is significantly lower in User Interface Design than in other areas.  </s>
<s> I personally believe that this is a result of marketing priorities, since it has been widely accepted for the last decade or so that graphical User Interfaces are more 'user friendly', at least in the 'mass-market'.  </s>
<s> (I am not a touch typist.  </s>
<s> But I do prefer to use a keyboard interface for all common tasks, and find it frustrating when there isn't one.) Charles McCN I agree that disability is frequently a mismatch between a person and the environment.  </s>

<s> The mouse is easier because there is a simple mental model to learn: see, point and click and you don't have to load your memory so much as you can usually see what is available.  </s>
<s> With typing UI's the user needs to remember the commands and keys to use.  </s>
<s> Touchtyping ability helps of course by automating the search of characters in the keyboard and making typing faster.  </s>
