This is an excerpt from a chapter I wrote on accommodating people with disabilities in web-based training programs, to be published later this year. 
I present it to stimulate discussion on how we might organize the "Functional and Technical Requirements" document. 
Alan A primer on disability What is disability? 
People are not "disabled." 
A disability is a consequence of design flaws 
in the environment. 
Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting. 
When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said 
to have a disability. 
Barriers People with disabilities face barriers that prevent them from realizing their full potential. 
Barriers may be physical, architectural, cultural, political, informational, or attitudinal. 
For people with disabilities in computer-based training programs, barriers frequently are due to poor planning or design. 
For example: 1. 
Most operating systems and software applications include poorly-designed features that compromise usability for people with certain disabilities. 
2. Cyberspace is increasingly multi-media. 
This characteristic works to the advantage of people with disabilities who might not otherwise be able to perceive everything on a site. 
However, if web designers provide information in only one format (e.g., images without accompanying text), or optimize a site for one particular browser, some people may be unable to access all important information. 
3. Access barriers result when web-designers do not consider all intended users. 
Making an accessible site is a matter of adhering to simple design principles. 
Functional limitations In addition to the barriers posed by poor design and planning, a person's functional limitations may make it physically hard to operate a keyboard or mouse, read a monitor or printout, or use other peripheral devices. 
Consider the functional limitations associated with seven different kinds of disability, and the effects of these limitations on an individual's ability to operate a computer: Visual impairments Visual impairments range from slightly reduced visual acuity to total blindness. 
A person with reduced visual acuity may have trouble reading the screen or distinguishing foreground text from background pattern on a web-page. 
People with more severe impairments rely on technologies that translate displayed text into synthesized speech, audible cues, or Braille. 
Hearing impairments Hearing impairments include problems distinguishing certain frequencies, sounds or words, ringing in the ears, and total deafness. 
A computer user who is hard of hearing or deaf may miss audible prompts, or not hear music and speech that are conveyed through the PC loudspeakers. 
Mobility impairments Mobility impairments include minor difficulties moving or coordinating a part of the body, muscle weakness, tremors, and in extreme cases, paralysis in one or more parts of the body. 
Mobility impairments can be congenital, such as Muscular Dystrophy; or acquired, such as tendinitis. 
Computer users who have upper-body mobility impairments may be unable to manipulate a mouse, press two keys on the keyboard simultaneously, or reach certain areas of a keyboard. 
Others may tend to hit several keys at once, or press keys inadvertently. 
Cognitive impairments Cognitive disabilities affect an individual's ability to think and reason. 
They are caused by genetic factors (e.g., Downs Syndrome), exposure to environmental toxins (as in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome), brain trauma, and psychiatric conditions. 
Cognitive impairments include memory loss, perceptual difficulties, and inability to concentrate. 
A person whose memory has been adversely affected by, say, a head injury, may be unable to recall the function of an icon or the menu on which a frequently-used command appears. 
Learning disabilities People with learning disabilities have average or above-average intelligence, but the ways they take in information, retain it, and express knowledge are affected. 
Learning disabilities affect reading comprehension, spelling, the mechanics of writing, manual dexterity, math computation, problem solving, processing speed, and the ability to organize space and manage time. 
Students in web-based training programs who have learning disabilities may have trouble reading or understanding printed materials, picking out pertinent information on a busy computer screen, or using a keyboard or mouse. 
Seizure disorders People with certain kinds of epilepsy may have seizures when exposed to a monitor that refreshes or a cursor that flashes at particular frequencies, or to sounds that repeat at certain rates. 
Speech impairments Speech difficulties do not usually affect one's ability to use a computer. 
In the future, speech impairments might affect computer use if voice input technologies become more usable, or if telephone and PC applications become fully integrated. 
Accommodations for people with disabilities Accommodations are bridges for overcoming design flaws in the environment and individual functional limitations. 
Accommodation is the process of modifying the environment to meet the needs of individuals who have difficulties performing tasks that many (perhaps most) other people can do. 
Accommodation involves removing or minimizing the adverse effects of barriers in the natural and human environments. 
These barriers prevent individuals with disabilities from achieving personal, educational, vocational and recreational goals. 
There are many ways to accommodate an individual in the home, workplace, library or classroom, including low-tech devices, spatial reorganization, work station modifications and building modifications (See Cantor 1996, 1998a). 
In computer-based training programs, most accommodations are likely to be adaptive hardware and software. 
Adaptive technologies for computer-based training programs Thousands of hardware and software products are available that allow people to overcome design flaws in the environment and their functional limitations. 
Adaptive technologies fall into two broad categories: input devices and techniques, and output hardware and software. 
Input devices and techniques - Modified keyboards. 
Miniature and enlarged keyboards; on-screen keyboards operated by switches, eye blinks, puff-and-sip devices, or a mouse; adjustable and split keyboards. 
- Mouse alternatives. 
Touch pads, track balls, and graphic tablets. 
- Mouse emulators. 
Software that modifies the keyboard so that the numeric keypad (or other keys) can be used to move and click the mouse. 
- Keyboard-only techniques. 
Methods for operating a PC using keyboard shortcuts and equivalents instead of a mouse. 
- Speech recognition systems. 
Software and hardware for entering text or issuing commands by voice. 
- Keyboard and mouse utilities. 
Software for adjusting the sensitivity and behaviour of the keyboard or mouse. 
- Word prediction and word completion software. 
Keystroke-saving programs that generate a list of words (or expressions) in response to typing one or more letters. 
For example, typing "wo" displays a menu that includes "word," "word prediction," "work," and "would." 
The user selects the desired item from the menu by pressing a key or clicking the mouse. 
- Abbreviation expansion software. 
Programs that instantly translate pre-defined codes into words or expressions. 
For example, typing "AES" yields "Abbreviation Expansion Software." - Macro software. 
Programs that record a series of commands or keystrokes, and replay them by pressing a key or clicking the mouse. 
Output hardware and software - Display properties utilities. 
Software that alters the size, colour and contrast of information on the screen. 
- Text-to-speech systems. 
Hardware and software that convert information displayed on the monitor into synthesized speech. 
- Text-to-Braille systems. 
Hardware and software that convert information displayed on the monitor to Braille, either through a special printer or a refreshable display. 
- Visual warning utilities. 
Software that converts auditory prompts into visual cues. 
Each person's accommodation needs are unique, and the variations, even among people having similar functional limitations, are great. 
The most reliable way to determine an individual's accommodation needs is to ask. 
Assume that the person with a disability is the expert on his or her accommodation requirements. 
I agree that disability is frequently a mismatch between a person and the environment. 
I also notice that mouse users are usually non-typists. 
Computer programmers are not usually typists. 
They find the mouse easier than learning good touch typing. 
Hence they design the interface for their touch typing disability.

It is a trivial issue, but there is a very large group of computer programmers (probably larger as a proportion than among general users) who prefer to use a command line (keyboard-based) environment than a 'point-and-click' User Interface). 
However it would be a fair observation that the proportion of these people is significantly lower in User Interface Design than in other areas. 
I personally believe that this is a result of marketing priorities, since it has been widely accepted for the last decade or so that graphical User Interfaces are more 'user friendly', at least in the 'mass-market'. 
(I am not a touch typist. 
But I do prefer to use a keyboard interface for all common tasks, and find it frustrating when there isn't one.) Charles McCN I agree that disability is frequently a mismatch between a person and the environment.

The mouse is easier because there is a simple mental model to learn: see, point and click and you don't have to load your memory so much as you can usually see what is available. 
With typing UI's the user needs to remember the commands and keys to use. 
Touchtyping ability helps of course by automating the search of characters in the keyboard and making typing faster.
