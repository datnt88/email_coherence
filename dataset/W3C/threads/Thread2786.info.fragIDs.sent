Paul Bennet has done a complete, nit-picking, read of draft 04... My thanks to him for the read. 
Having recently become convinced that there will (almost certainly) be a draft 05, I'm forwarding this list to the mailing list so it will get archived. 
- Jim Jim, I've just completed reviewing the '-04' revision of the HTTP/1.1 spec, and have some comments for you. 
Most of these comments are simple editorial matters. 
There are a few genuine errors I noticed; I've listed things in decreasing order of severity (I'd understand if you never get to the end of this list, but I'd rather you dealt with the first couple). 
The spec's looking in good shape; I bet you'll be pleased to see it reach Draft Standard. 
Paul. 
Out and out mistakes * Page 2, last sentence: "See section 18 for the full copyright notice." - that should be section *20*. 
(I believe Henrik has already notified you of this one.) * Section 2.1 "Augmented BNF", p15, last sentence of first paragraph ("implied *LWS" rule): '(for the definition of "token" above)' - you mean, *below* (the def's in section 2.2). 
* Section 5.1.2 "Request-URI", p33, second para talks about replacing 'a null abs_path with "*"' - surely it's replaced with a "/". 
* Section 8.1.3 "Proxy Servers", first paragraph: "... as specified in section 14.2.1." - no such section exists; maybe you mean section 14.10? 
* Section 13.2.4 "Expiration Calculations", end of second paragraph: "(see section 14.10." 
- missing right bracket, and the section number's wrong - should be 14.9.3. 
* Section 13.5.2 
"Non-modifiable Headers", page 79, last sentence on page refers to "Warning 114 (Transformation Applied)". 
That should be "214", according to section 14.46, page 126. 
This sentence also includes repetition: "..., if not already present, ... if one does not already appear in the message.". * Section 14.24 "If-None-Match", third para on p112, last sentence: "... then the server MUST not return a 304 ..."; the "not" should be capitalised: "... the server MUST NOT return a 304 ...". * Section 14.31 "Max-Forwards" refers to section 14.31 for the TRACE method; this should be section 9.8. 
* Section 19.4.2 "Conversion to Canonical Form" refers to "Appendix G of RFC 2045" - such an appendix doesn't exist! 
The closest I can find is section 6.6... or maybe you mean something else. 
* Section 13.5.1 
"End-to-end and Hop-by-hop Headers" refers to the Keep-Alive field, which doesn't exist any more. 
Clarifications * Section 2.2 "Basic Rules", "TEXT" rule: " any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS ". 
This excludes the optional "CRLF" of "LWS" by virtue of those two octets being CTLs, but it took a second reading to see this; perhaps " any OCTET except CTLs, but including HT and SP " would be clearer. 
* Section 2.2 "Basic Rules", "Note:" in "quoted-pair" description: I *think* I get what the example's on about: it's the significance of an HT and/or SP before "a" and "quoted-string", right? 
But the indentation of the example doesn't make this clear; perhaps indent those two lines more than the first of the example, or add more description to the text. 
* Sections 9.3 "GET", 9.4 "HEAD" and 9.7 "DELETE" don't explicitly rule out the presence of an entity-body, as section 9.8 "TRACE" does. 
* Section 10.2.2 "201 Created" says nothing about the format of the response entity. 
(section 10.3.1 "300 Multiple Choices" in a similar position is explicitly non-committal. 
* Section 10.3.6 "305 Use Proxy": "The Location field gives the URI of the proxy." 
But nowhere can I find a specification for this URI form; presumably it's an HTTP URI without an abs_path part. 
Typos * Section 3.6 "Transfer Codings", third paragraph: "section 14.4114.41" 
clearly should read "section 14.41". 
* Section 3.7.2 
"Multipart Types", third paragraph is a repetition of the penultimate sentence of the second paragraph (but maybe you intended the repetition to emphasise the point!). * Section 10.1 "Informational 1xx": "There are no required headers for this class of status codes." 
Should be "code" singular, I think. 
* Section 10.2.7 "206 Partial Content", first bullet point: "If a Content-Length header field is present in the response MUST match ..." words missing! 
Probably want "... in the response, its value MUST match ...". * Section 13.2.4 "Expiration Calculations", page 72, second para: weird additional whitespace in first line of this paragraph. 
Also, the last sentence includes repetition: "If the value is greater than 24 hours, ... whose age is more than 24 hours ...". * Section 13.3.3 
"Weak and Strong Validators", first two sentences should be a single one (the first one doesn't make sense alone; perhaps replace "... different entities. 
One normally ..." with "... different entities, one normally ...". * Section 13.5.3 
"Combining Headers", second paragraph starts "In the status code is 304" - that should be "If the status code ...". 
The last sentence of this paragraph also repeats "see 13.5.4". 
* Section 13.5.4 
"Combining Byte Ranges", last paragraph: "If either requirement is not meant ..." should be "not met", presumbaly. 
* Section 13.13 "History Lists", fourth paragraph: "This is not be construed to prohibit" - should be "This is not construed ..." * Section 14.8 "Authorization", last sentence of first para on p91: "(assuming that the authentication schemed ..." should be "scheme" (spurious 'd'). 
* Section 14.21 "Expires", last paragraph "... an response ..." should be "... a response ..." * Section 14.25 "If-None-Match", end of first sentence: "... used with a method to make the method conditional." 
should be "... used with a method to make it conditional.". 
This brings the wording in line with that of the other If-* headers, as well as saving bytes :-) * Section 14.35.2 "Range Retrieval Requests", second para on p118: "intermediate caches ought tosupport" - space missing between "to" and "support". 
* Section 14.45 "Via", first para: spurious whitespace at start of fifth line. 
* Section 14.46 "Warning", first sentence: "transformation of a message whichmight" - missing space. 
Also spurious extra space at the start of the fourth para on p125: " Warning headers can * Section 19.6.3 "Changes from RFC 2068", p146, third from last paragraph: extra right bracket: "A new error code (416))". 
Things you've probably debated to death * Throughout: "inbound" vs. "upstream" - these terms seem to refer to the same concept, but are not defined or used consistently. 
"inbound": 13.11, 14.31, 14.35.2, 19.6.2 "outbound": 13.2.3, 14.34 "upstream": 10.5.3, 10.5.5, 14.45, 19.6.3, "downstram": 14.33 * Section 3.6.1 
"Chunked Transfter Coding", "chunk-data" production: "chunk-size(OCTET)" at a casual glance *might* imply "1*HEX OCTET", when presumably you mean "n*n OCTET ; where n is the value of chunk-size". 
* Section 15.1.2 "Transfer of Sensitive Information": given recent well-publicised security holes in specific user agents, perhaps "User-agent" should be added to the list of sensitive fields. 
Cross-references * Throughout: I'd like to see more cross-referencing. 
Particularly, against most occurrances of method names, field names, status and warning codes. 
* Section 1.2 "Requirements": the key words "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" are mentioned, but requirements for (un)conditionally compliant implementations with respect to these words are not laid down. 
Suggest: replace "the MUST requirements" with "the MUST, REQUIRED and SHALL requirements". 
* Section 3.2.2 "http URL", second paragraph: "... and the Request-URI ..." a forward reference to section 5.1.2 (for Request-URI) would be helpful. 
* Section 3.3.1 
"Full Date": needs forward-reference to section 19.3 (concerning the "year 2000 problem"). 
* Section 8.2.1 "Persistent Connections and Flow Control": reference to section 3.6 ("chunked encoding") should more accurately be a reference to section 3.6.1. 
* Section 13.6 "Caching Negotiated Responses", first sentence refers to section 12; 12.1 would be more accurate. 
* Section 14.4 "Accapt-Language" should refer to section 3.10. 
* Section 14.5 "Accept-Range" should refer to section 3.12. 
* Section 14.15 "Content-Encoding", second para on p100 refers to 14.15 itself! 
* Section 14.15 "Content-Range" should refer to section 3.12. 
* Section 14.21 "Expires", third paragraph refers to section 3.3; 3.3.1 
would be more accurate. 
* Section 14.24 "If-Match" should refer so section 3.11. 
Really petty stuff * Section 4.5 "General Header Fields": the BNF is *almost* in alphabetical order (shift "Trailer" up two places and you're there). 
Also: comment part of "Warning" isn't quite aligned with the other comments. 
* Section 5.3, "Request Header Fields": more alphabetical BNF: "If-Match" should appear before "If-Modified-Since". 
* Section 10.2.5 "204 No Content" and section 10.2.6 "205 Reset Content", last sentence of each, differ in their terminology: 204 says "The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body"; 205 says "The response MUST NOT include an entity". 
* Section 10.4.15 "414 Request URI Too Long": spurious extra space before the full-stop at the end of the first sentence. 
* Section 13.1.4 
"Explicit User Agent Warnings": spurious extra full-stop at the end of the first paragraph. 
* Section 19.6.3 "Changes from RFC 2068", top of p146: spurious extra space at start of first line: " Content-Base was deleted ...". 
Also, spurious extra whitespace at the start of points six and sever (page 147). 
Things you know about, but I'll mention anyway * Throughout: The [jg] footnotes * Throughout: "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication"; presumably you're waiting for an RFC number (but you might also flag these as [43]). 
This appears at least in these sections: 10.4.2, 10.4.8, 11, 14.8, 14.33, 14.34, 14.47 * Section 14.16 "Content-Range", second para on p104, "See appendix Error! 
Reference source not found". 
* Section 19.1 "Internet Media Type message/http and application/http": screwy line-wrapping in the Encoding considerations section of application/http. 
* Section 19.6 "Compatibility with Previous Versions", last sentence: "Error! 
Reference source not found" - presumably this should instead refer to RFC2068 since Keep-Alive has now gone. 
* Section 21 "Index": the index is broken - at least, a good percentage of the referenced pages are irrelevant, which is a real shame because the index looks great and is *vital* in a document this size :-( Notice: This contribution is the personal view of the author and does not necessarily reflect the technical nor commercial direction of British Telecommunications plc. 
Some comments on Paul Bennet's comments: [It's reassuring to come upon someone else who can be as nit-picky as I am. :-)] 
I was about to say, vigorously, "no", but now I think I'm just confused about just what the point is of that paragraph. 
The paragraph says: Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path In requests that they forward, transparent proxies MUST NOT rewrite the "abs_path" part of a Request-URI in any way except as noted above to 
replace a null abs_path with "*", no matter what the proxy does in its 
internal implementation. 
If "abs_path" in the paragraph refers to the non-terminal in the Request-URI production, then I have to ask, how can it be null in the first place? 
When is Request-URI null? 
OTOH, if we're talking about the "abs_path" that's part of the "absoluteURI", then I might be inclined to agree with Paul. 
That's because we've discussed the possibility that, some time in the future, it might make sense to include an entity-body for them.

That is a leftover from when Max-Forwards was not allowed to be used with an OPTIONS request. 
That stuff should be removed. 
Unfortunately, I don't have time to make a diff to give better guidance about where "that stuff" is precisely -- one more thing to do on the plane to Chicago.
