<s> I have just creatd some style sheets by hand.  </s>
<s> They look like this: aeg_root/dyslexia.css  </s>
<s> body { color : black; background : white; font : aerial, sans-serif; font-size : 200%; aeg_root/low-vis.css  </s>
<s> body { color : white; background : black; font : aerial, sans-serif; font-size : 200%; aeg_root/standard.css  </s>
<s> body { color : black; background : white; font : times-roman, serif; Then I did this [head aeg_root/index.html]:  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd" According to my understanding of: this is all correct.  </s>
<s> Invoking Amaya I get the style associated with "standard.css"  </s>
<s> which is what I expect.  </s>
<s> What I do not see is how to invoke the alternate stylesheets.  </s>
<s> I looked under all the menus which are available in browser mode, and under style menu in edit mode, and in any menu I could get by clicking on the document itself.  </s>
<s> [Mind you, I could not see how to get this to work in Netscape 4.72, or IE5.5  </s>
<s> either, so comments on those (off list) would help.]  </s>
<s> I'm using Amaya 5.1 for Windows, under win98.  </s>

<s> /tr/rec-css1 also provides a correctly linked alternate stylesheet  </s>
<s> for testing purposes.  </s>
<s> It seems this is a 'missed' fuction within Amaya.  </s>
<s> The menu item Style / Stylesheet allows opening , linking , removing, and adding.  </s>
<s> It seems another item should be here to 'select alternate'  </s>
<s> perhaps displaying the list of alternates provided by the doc author  </s>
<s> and allowing user to choose!  </s>
<s> The #3 browser Opera also does not seem to offer this functionality.  </s>
<s> Is this something that he recommendation anticipated for but no user agent followed up on (ie.  </s>
<s> similar to the table column headings/footers that were not to scroll while rows did (if not less than window)??  </s>
<s> John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or  </s>
<s> I have not tried that.  </s>
<s> Yes, I just found that out.  </s>
<s> Mozilla doesn't seem to support this either.  </s>
<s> I cannot see any other sufficiently advanced browser that might.  </s>
<s> Ygdrasil don't seem to have touched Arena since 1998.  </s>
<s> Mnemonic seems to have come to a stop last year.  </s>
<s> I am beginning to wonder where all this is going.  </s>
<s> I know the Amaya team is *really* small, but the others don't have that problem.  </s>
<s> There is mention of CSS3 now, there is XSL, there are a whole load of new things like XHTML, DHTML, not to mention XML, and still standards of 5 years ago are not implemented.  </s>
<s> Hugh  </s>
<s> I'm not sure we can answer this request quickly but we added it to our todo list.  </s>
<s> That is fine.  </s>
<s> It is not for me to set your priorities :-) and your small team is under constant pressure... Thank you.  </s>
