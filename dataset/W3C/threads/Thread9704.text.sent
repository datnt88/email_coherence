This is the main comment that jumped at me as I read this doc (v1.27 a/c to the embedded CVS log comments). 
Only other comment is a nagging worry that this is too close to Primer territory in a few places. 
Sorry not to provide details. 
Anyway, re A media type, application/rdf+xml is being registered for indicating the use of RDF/XML as an assertional representation in this way [RDF-MIME-TYPE]. 
This isn't true, as far as I can tell. 
Please remove this paragrpah or move it elsewhere in the doc. 
Re-reading - ...I see no evidence that content published as application/rdf+xml must be asserted. 
I think the mediatype registration was slimmed down to avoid such talk (thankfully). 
I currently publish several documents as application/rdf+xml that I do not assert, fwiw. 
I use that media type only so that others know the documents are encodings of RDF graphs. 
The cotnent of the graph can then bootstrap the who-said-what side of things, or not, as the case may be. 
For eg. it might say that I'm the dc:creator, and point to my PGP signature of the doc. 
cheers, Dan Isn't true because the registration process isn't complete, or because of the assertional nature claimed? 
latter. 
It doesn't claim all applicatoin/rdf+xml is asserted (by publisher or whoever -- that's part of the problem). 
Regarding the latter, I can't find any definitive documentation of this -- the new document was intended to provide that (among other things) but I understood that was the intent of the working group; it's an assumption that seems to me to have permeated many discussions we've had; e.g. 
As was clear in Dan Connolly's draft[1], it is important that the media type specification make this point clear. 
I have included the wording: Because RDF is a format for semantically-meaningful information, it is important to note that transmission of RDF via HTTP, SMTP or some similar protocol, means that the sender asserts the content of the RDF document.

RDF can't do a protocol's job for it.

The HTTP 200 bit is quite relevant... this issue has a lot to do with the protocol context in which RDF is used. 
As such, I originally considered this issue part of but it was split out.

I concede that nothing here is definitive, and in reviewing the various discussions I think I've maybe focused too exclusively on MIME type -- but the idea that protocol context (which IMO includes MIME type) goes toward determining if some RDF is asserted I think *is* a common understanding.
