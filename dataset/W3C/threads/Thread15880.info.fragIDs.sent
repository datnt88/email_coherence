<s> Leigh, re your question  </s>
<s> difficulties  </s>
<s> LRK:: This is interesting from a disability standpoint because - an able-bodied (or temporarily able bodied, TAB) person using a touch screen encounters functional limitations similar to those of a person with a motor impairment using a device such as a mouse or trackball.  </s>
<s> - the methods needed to help a TAB person handle closely spaced links with a touch screen may help people with motor impairments handle the more widely spaced links on that touch screen.  </s>
<s> - some of the approaches (#3, 4 below) only work well if the page was designed to be accessible for people with who have low vision and/or are blind.  </s>
<s> - the on-screen keyboard needed for alpha input is like those used in some disability apps.  </s>
<s> In short, a case for universal design.  </s>
<s> And now for some suggestions....  </s>
<s> Aside from Alpha input, the main problem for using a touch screen on a web page is difficulty of hitting the target accurately.  </s>
<s> There are a number of ways around this: 1.  </s>
<s> If you have a force sensitive touch screen, then you can position a pointer by lightly moving your finger until the pointer lines up with the target and then pressing harder.  </s>
<s> However, I don't know of any commercially available force sensitive touch screens.  </s>
<s> (I designed a couple of such screens a while back but they are not currently manufactured: cf. patent 4,710,760 Photoelastic touch-sensitive screen patent 4,484,179 Touch position sensitive surface Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I wonder how these would work for a person with motor impairments?  </s>
<s> Maybe use to smooth tremors?  </s>
<s> Well, that's off the point at the moment) 2. There's also the "drag tap" interface like what's used in some laptops with touch pads.  </s>
<s> You drag the pointer to the screen by sliding your finger to the spot and then tap (anywhere) to activate.  </s>
<s> So you can get more accuracy than if just touching the screen activated the link.  </s>
<s> If this is for casual walk-up use though, some people might not catch on.  </s>
<s> Also, this could cause problems for person with motor impairments.  </s>
<s> 3. Getting to your question about doctoring the pages, you could decrease the need for fine positioning by enlarging all the text links by increasing the font size, and magnfiy all image maps till targets are separated.  </s>
<s> This would screw up layout of some web pages unless... and this is interesting... the author of the web page designed it with ACCESSIBILITY in mind to allow it to take larger font sizes.  </s>
<s> E.g. by avoiding a backbround image that's supposed to line up with text, e.g. the left hand menu bar idiom.  </s>
<s> 4. Another way to doctor the page would add javascript whereever there are closely spaced links so that clicking on one of the lines brings up a menu of the nearby links.  </s>
<s> Again, this works best if the page was designed to be accessible: with links that make sense when read alone out of context (to avoid a menu that says click here click here click here And ALT text for each AREA in an image map.  </s>
<s> There's also the issues of making sure tha people with disabilities can use these screens, especially if you're looking a kiosks.  </s>
<s> For people who are blind, you'll need a speech interface, e.g. Gregg Vanderheiden's speech system.  </s>
<s> Plus, it should be possible to contol the link spacing criterion so that people with motor impairments can get assistance.  </s>
<s> In general, some work would be needed to help people with motor impairments use the screen.  </s>
<s> E.g. anti bounce, motion averaging.  </s>
<s> Also, you'll need an onscrren keyboard for alpha input.  </s>

<s> A few years ago I spoke with someone who had developed a visitor's information display that was designed for accessability.  </s>
<s> This was a sort of pedastal that housed a pc and would be installed in large public buildings.  </s>
<s> It included a touch screen operation that worked, as I recall, something like this: When a visitor approached the display, there was a screen divided into 4 or 6 equal rectangles and a recorded message that described the operation.  </s>
<s> the visitor was invited to touch the upper left rectangle to switch to accessable mode.  </s>
<s> The accessable mode then used a combination of large print and voice recording that guided the visitor to other display choices.  </s>
<s> A blind visitor could , for example, press the left center of the screen or the bottom right of the screen to hear about another selection.  </s>
<s> Basically there were two modes, one for persons with normal vision and one for persons blind or visually impaired.  </s>
<s> With the latter mode, the voice explained each screen and which part of the screen to press for other choices.  </s>
<s> The demo I tried worked very well for a blind user.  </s>
<s> I would think for web site design, you could do something similar.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, perhaps there is some way of letting the user know which selection they have touched and asking confirmation before proceding.  </s>
<s> This is more "hit and miss" for the blind user, but if the number of choices are kept to just a handful,well-spaced and if the location of the confirmation button is standardized, it could work.  </s>
<s> Another possibility (which would not depend on built-in audio support) is to design the screen is such a way that the mouse can always be used to click on the touch spot.  </s>
<s> Mose screen readers provide a keyboard mouse that the blind reader can use, but there needs to be a text label to latch on to the right location.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> LRK outlined some approaches.  </s>
<s> How about if the mountain won't come to .... the difficulty would appear to be in getting finger and hot link together.  </s>
<s> If its hard to get the finger to a small area, how about sensing the touch, then causing the nearest link to 'hot up', and present itself?  </s>
<s> The touchscreen coordinates know where the finger is - use this to 'snap' the nearest link to the users finger (touch object if not a finger).  </s>
<s> This could be easily done visually or aurally - informing the user which link is now ready for activation.  </s>
<s> If its the wrong one, lift off or move.  </s>
<s> If OK, hold for a period or some other ack signal to say go.  </s>
<s> This could be done with a local Java app using a small message area for messages or speech output even better.  </s>
<s> That way we operate with any hot linked page, instead of asking authors to change the way they operate, one of TV's themes.  </s>
<s> Just a thought.  </s>
