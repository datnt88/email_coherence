<s> I don't think we need to address signature schemes based on autographs for the following reasons: 1) The packing format had better allow any signature scheme which produces as authentication data a string o' bits which is a function of the message and optionaly some additional data.  </s>
<s> There are good reasons for allowing an SHA-1 hash or an HMAC authentication blob, biometrics should be simply another such blob.  </s>
<s> 2) Do we think we have a need for significant input of crypto expertise?  </s>
<s> I don't think so, at this level we are treating PKCS#1 RSA, DSS etc as well behaved black boxes.  </s>
<s> If we feel we can proceed without detailed instructions along the way from Rogaway, Rivest, Kaliski et al we whould expect autograph identification methods to be capable of being treated in an equally black box fashion.  </s>
<s> 3) Biometric techniques are not commodified to the same extent that RSA, DSS etc are.  </s>
<s> Patent issues aside, RSA is RSA whoever you buy it from, same for DSS.  </s>
<s> Even the more 'exotic' reaches of cryptography such as eliptic curve are well defined and standards defined.  </s>
<s> I don't think it would be possible to address biometric techniques without addressing specific proprietary techniques which would in turn lead to the issue of endorsement which I don't think W3C should get involved in - not unless they want to actually conduct trials of biometric techniques which I don't think they do.  </s>
<s> 4) The applications of biometrics and the applications of digital  </s>
<s> signatures are disjoint.  </s>
<s> I do not see an overlap, I consider biometrics important precisely because they can do things which digital signatures cannot.  </s>
<s> I don't No biometric technique is proof against a sampling attack.  </s>
<s> Each person has one and only one biometric profile.  </s>
<s> Individual mechanisms may sample that profile and base their analysis on a subset but there is no means of preventing a complete sampling of the original.  </s>
<s> At most a biometric proves is that there was knowledge of a biometric profile required to create a signature.  </s>
<s> That is very different to the assurance of a digital signature which establishes that there was knowledge of a specific piece of information.  </s>
<s> Empirically, it is easier to do a biometric scanning attack than  </s>
<s> a brain scanning attack!  </s>
<s> It is also easier to learn new pieces of information than change your fingerprint or autograph.  </s>
<s> I know there are folk in the biometric industry who dispute this, and that is kind of the point.  </s>
<s> I don't think the argument is usefull or necessary however.  </s>
<s> It is currently raqging with much FUD in the legal arena.  </s>
<s> I don't think we need to have the arguments rehearsed here too... Phill  </s>
<s> I agree that careful thought on boundaries is needed here.  </s>
<s> There are potentially three task areas: (1) Canonicalizing XML.  </s>
<s> A reasonable family of clearly defined, stable, and relatively easy to implement canonicalizations of XML need to be defined.  </s>
<s> For many applications, you would want to canonicalize.  </s>
<s> This includes cases where you sign XML regardless of how the signature syntax.  </s>
<s> (2) Packaging.  </s>
<s> This is actually a broader topic than it seems.  </s>
<s> There are potentially many facets as follows, although I think only one is interesting here: (2a) How to package arbitrary stuff in MIME, documented in RFCs 2045-2049.  </s>
<s> (2b) How to package XML in MIME, currently documented in RFC 2376 but undergoing review.  </s>
<s> (2c) How to package signed/encrypted stuff in MIME, documented in RFC 1847.  </s>
<s> (Used in some email formats and convenient to have as a default but many protocols have their own syntax with provisions for signature, encrypted fields, etc.) (2d) How to package arbitrary stuff in XML, undefined: presumably will be something like a mapping of MIME into an XML syntax with appropriate defaults so that simple cases are very concise.  </s>
<s> (2e) How to package arbitrary MIME in XML, undefined: MIME ... /MIME ?  </s>
<s> (2f) How to package signed/encrypted stuff in XML, undefined: possible a mapping of the RFC 1847 MIME into an XML syntax.  </s>
<s> (Only needed as a default since many protocols will have their own syntax with provisions for signatures, encrypted fields, etc.)  </s>
<s> (3) XML Signature Syntax.  </s>
<s> There appears to be controversy here.  </s>
<s> Some want  </s>
<s> to start with CMS/PKCS#7 but map it into XML syntax and extend it to meet the requirements, presumably resulting in something like the Richard Brown proposal.  </s>
<s> Others want to just use a PKCS#7 binary blob.  </s>
<s> The blob approach loses all of the transparency and extensibility of XML.  </s>
<s> It is not clear that it can meet the requirements for support of keyed hashes.  </s>
<s> You are locked into having two mutually alien sets of encoding/decodig logic: XML and ASN.1/DER.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, wtih XML syntax as show in the Richard Brown proposal, you do have the readability and extensibility that are goals of XML.  </s>
<s> Quite frankly, if you go with the blob, I don't see any justification for calling the result an XML digital signature.  </s>

<s> Hi Donald,  </s>
<s> want  </s>
<s> The declared result we are trying to achieve is "Signed XML" which is not necessarily the same thing as an XML digital signature.  </s>
<s> Also, the declared result is "Signed XML" and has not been officially called "Cryptographically Signed XML".  </s>
<s> Does the signature itself have to be human readable, or does an application put functions in place to query the signature blob to obtain the information it needs.  </s>
<s> We will be able to achieve the same end results whichever format we choose.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, handwritten signatures are not as safe from tampering as true cryptographic signatures, but they do achieve a fairly high level of security from encrypting the biometric token.  </s>
<s> Further, this is the only security method I've seen them use, so if we do want blob transparency or even translucency, then we are deciding to eliminate handwritten signatures.  </s>
<s> More generally, the approach we use in XFDL is one which says that the signing engine produces a 'black box', which we base-64 encode and put into character content.  </s>
<s> A verification uses the verify engine on the base-64 decoded 'black box'.  </s>
<s> This approach simplifies integration of new cryptographic technologies, frees them from the requirement of XML awareness (XML isn't the only format in the world, after all), and allows support for non-cryptographic signature technologies.  </s>
<s> Most importantly, it reduces the burden on the W3C/IETF reference code implementers.  </s>
<s> If we adopt a spec that is heavily cryptographic, it may require the reference implementations to contain enough of a cryptographic interface that they cannot be freely distributed due to export restrictions.  </s>
<s> By comparison XFDL, defines a signature technology interface of only a dozen functions, and a new signature technology can be incorporated in two to four person weeks.  </s>
<s> We've done this for CryptoAPI, Netscape, Entrust, and PenOp so far, so this is a pretty safe estimate.  </s>
<s> Because the integration is at such a high level, there is no export trouble on our signature engine.  </s>
<s> The only restrictions are on the cryptographic modules themselves, which are external to our core product.  </s>

<s> Hi Bede, Actually, you start out incorrect, but then begin deriving some of the very ideas behind handwritten signature technologies.  </s>
<s> First off, by handwritten signature technology, I am not referring to a simple signature bitmap (although one can be included for display purposes).  </s>
<s> PenOp is an example of a technology that binds the handwritten signature to the document.  </s>
<s> Further, they would argue that they do a better job of binding the document to the signer than cryptography does.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I agree that they do a better job than cryptography in any area of signature technology, but I'm not prepared to argue that the technology is useless, in part because several deployments of XFDL use PenOp signatures.  </s>
<s> They bind the document to the signature as follows: 1) 90 or so measures of a person's handwriting style are recorded into a "biometric token".  </s>
<s> 2) a secure hash of the document is computed (sha-1 or md5) 3) 1 and 2 are concatenated and the result is encrypted Now, as I just said in a very pleasant phone conversation with Don Eastlake, I'm quite sure that the use of encryption is simply to obfuscate matters and does not represent a cryptographic strength security solution.  </s>
<s> Though a tractable problem, it is still quite difficult and expensive to reverse engineer this technology.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it makes sense for many types of deployments where one expects high volume, relatively low value transactions where the organization wants to avoid the cost and difficulty of setting up a PKI for walk-in business.  </s>
<s> It is probably not "reasonable doubt" to assert that the organization broke the signature technology since, based on the value of the transaction, it is probably too costly to do that or it is less expensive to forge the person's signature (the "old fashioned" way).  </s>
<s> So you see, the opaqueness of the blob (offered by the encryption) is how these handwritten signature technologies can claim to bind the signature (biometric data) to the document (secure hash).  </s>
<s> Hence, if we only support signing technologies that allow a human readable format, then we are, by definition, excluding handwritten signature technologies.  </s>
<s> Maybe this is what the group wants to do, but I think it is at least important that we know we're making this choice rather than having it sail by unnoticed.  </s>
<s> In UWI's case, I'm pretty sure our executive will not want to throw out a good revenue stream because of the standard, so XFDL will most likely to continue to support this form of 'signed' XML.  </s>
<s> It will just be unfortunate that the signed XML standard cannot accommodate all kinds of signed XML.  </s>
