Hello, 
We are making an application based on Thot. 
We want to print some documents that are larger than one page's width, and we would prefer that the lines won't be cut. 
That's why we want to print the view on a matrix of sheets. 
The following exemple needs 2*2 sheets to be printed. 
I've read all the documentation and mailing list archives I could find, but I can't manage to do that. 
So my questions are : How can I do that? 
Is it possible? 
If Thot isn't able to do that, are you planning to implement that fonctionnality? 
If not, do you think it possible to make a patch, and where, in the code, should we work? 
Hoping you can help me,

The above looks malformed to me. 
I guess you like to print 2 pages side by side on one side of the paper (or 4 in a square)?? 
Yep, it is possible (at least with postscript and/or on unix based machines): Most postscript printers come with print tool kits with options to do this. 
Here at the office, we have some (old) digital printers with a command `lpspr`. 
Other printers have other tools. 
With most of these tools I've seen, the option to put 2 pages on one side is called 'number up' There is also a public domain tool called `a2ps` (Anything to PostScript) which can do this. 
As I recal by head did it get worse with amaya 1.3 but (just tested) it works well with amaya 1.4. 
I don't think this number-up is to be put in Amaya. 
A better option for Amaya is a 'print scaling factor' and print multiple pages wide: - % to resize the printout by hand - print to encaptulated postscript (EPS) generating X * Y files - fit to (one or more) page width - fit to (one or more) page hight - even mangling the aspect ratio by using both fit in X * Y pages - Select landscape or portrait - More paper sizes (the A0 - A8 range is easy to accomplish once you have A4) - print current viewport (screendump with better resolution than the screeen grabber) I don't see all of the above options into thot or amaya at once but 
Your option goes in the `file- print` option: change `lpr` to `a2ps`. 
At least on the unix variant. 
I don't know for the M$Win variants. 
I guess you print to file and have it printed with an other tool. 
I just gave you a workaround, I hope you can work with it. 
Something else: If you can see the entire page on screen, make a screendump with your favorite program. 
For X11: `xv` can do a lot here.

It's not so easy to do that. 
What I can suggest is to modify the x.P schema and print the document in A4R instead of A4. To do that you have to change page width and page height in the x.P schema and and define the right options in file x.conf options pagesize: A4 orientation: Landscape Regards Irene.
