I've been having some firewall problems accessing the CVS server, but 
Dimitris has promised to send me a zip or tar of the current DOM-TS package 
and we'll investigate the Xalan issues. 
I was speaking with Shane Curcuru, who maintains our own Ant scripts, and if I understood him correctly there may be some moderately ugly issues regarding Ant's classpaths. 
If you're trying to use Ant's built-in XSLT support it may not be finding the instances of Xalan and Xerces you intended it to. 
I believe our regression-test Ant scripts invoke Xalan explicitly as a workaound for that problem. 
When I get a copy of the tests, I'll forward 'em to Shane for his comments/advice.

I just sent Joe a compressed version of a recent checkout, hopefully we will have meaningful feedback shortly. 
Thanks for looking into this. 
Th eproblem description you give closely resembles symptoms I've seen on my machine, so hopefully we'll be able to nail down possible causes. 
/Dimitris 
I'm in an offline discussion with Shane Curcuru about Ant that will hopefully move to this list soon trying to resolve problems. 
Again, there are a series of issues to which we can all contribute, as far as Ant issues are concerned especially to provide information about what setup you use, if you have experienced any problems like the ones I and Curt have described and so forth.
