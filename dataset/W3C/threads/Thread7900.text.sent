I'd definitely be interested in working on notifications. 
We'd like clients to be able to know about events like the ones you suggest, plus: - new resource in collection I'm subscribed to - Access control change in resource I'm subscribed to - New version in VCR (similar to your update/last-modified event, perhaps equivalent) How do we proceed?

By this I mean, in short, being able to subscribe to a resource, such that when things happen to it, such as: o property change o update (last modified) o invalidate o lock expiration / lock override o deleted a subscribed entity would receive a notification. 
There's been some relevant work here in the form of an HTTP extension (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods) in the past to deal with some of these issues. 
It was work that was previously done in the context of using HTTP for IM and it quite similar to the SIP subscription extensions. 
Does this sound at all like something the group would be interested in taking a closer look at ?

Subject: Re: WebDAV Invalidation (Was Re: Allow: header and supported methods) Date: Wed, 22 Aug 2001 21:40:39 +0200 The protocol described in the ESI document allows to invalidate documents that have been downloaded to a local machine by applying a push technology. 
This could solve already several conflict situations or even partly prevent problems. 
On the other hand there seems to be an increasing need for more fine-grained notification services that extend the traditional access control systems. 
Picture 1 in the following longer article tries to classify them: "Beyond 'Yes or No' - Extending Access Control in Groupware with Negotiation and Awareness" (http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~os/Publications/COOP98a.ps) 
Maybe those needs are also worth discussing if they could be supported in the spec in order to allow applications to build up on them. 
The invalidation protocol seems to be a good basis also for this.

If there's enough interest, we can create a proposed charter and petition the area directors for a new working group.
