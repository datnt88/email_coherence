Can someone give me some simple pointers on how to insert styles into an Amaya web page without doing it by hand. 
I have read the instructions but something seems miss me as I can't seem to get it to work. 
Any help would be appreciated. 
Thank you, Bill. 
Here is how to do it with what Amaya supports right now. 
For a selection: 1. Highlight it. 
2. Open the Style menu and modify the style in one of the four options at the top. 
For an element: 1. Select text within the element. 
2. Press F2 to select it. 
3. Repeat until desired element is selected (look in status bar). 
4. Do step 2 for a selection. 
To expand a style to an entire page (for all elements in a page or certain classes): 1. Follow the steps for an element. 
2. Highlight the element. 
3. Click Style  Create rule. 
4. Type either the element name (to apply to elements) or a class name to apply to a certain class (begin with a period). 
To apply a premade class: Either 1. Select an element or selection. 
2. Click Style  Apply classes. 
or 1. Select an element or selection. 
2. Click Attributes  Class. 
3. Type the appropriate class name.
