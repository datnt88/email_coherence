<s> Hello, I would like to gather the group of volunteers that will translate XML 1.0 Recommendation to Polish.  </s>
<s> Could you please inform me if there is (or was) already similar translating initiative?  </s>
<s> Regards, Szymon Ziolo  </s>
<s> Hello Szymon, I'm not aware of anybody else translating XML to Polish, but I don't remember every message on this list.  </s>
<s> To check, please do a search in the list archive using the form on  </s>
<s> Please also note that a second edition of the XML 1.0 Recommendation is being finalized (http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814).  </s>
<s> I would suggest to you and everybody else working on an XML translation that you align your translation with (the final version, not the current draft) of the second edition.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Probably we will start translating the first edition, and when the final version of second edition will be available, we will update our translation.  </s>
<s> I will inform you when we (the group of translators) make decision on that and when we start the translation process.  </s>
