I'm posting this again, because our IT guys said there may have been problems with our Exchange server, and it may have not gone out. 
I'd really like to get some feedcback from someone on the list regarding this. 
I'm back on Level 3 Load/Save for DOM-Lingo, and I have a quick question (based on the 09 Apr 2002 Draft): DocumentLS.saveXML isn't clear enough as to whether it's deep or not. 
If the snode parameter is null, the whole document is serialized. 
OK, that's deep. 
But if it is non-null, then ONLY the Node provided is serialized? 
What if one wishes to use DocumentLS.saveXML to serialize a specific node AND its children? 
I think it might be nice to have a boolean deep argument for this method, and specify that the provided Node, and all its children, may be serialized if the deep parameter is true. 
If false, then only the provided Node is serialized. 
And also, regarding the utility of the WWW-DOM list: how are posts such as these handled by the WG? Are they entered as Issues to be resolved as part of the current Draft cycle? 
Or are they simply reviewed and resonded to in real time, if a response is deemed appropriate?

Thanks for the response, As far as I can remember this is meant to be deep all the time. 
Let me check it with the next telco of the editorial team to see whether we need to change the description of saveXML.I don't see any use case for a non-deep serialization of a node. 
The dom wg responses to postings to www-dom either explicit or implicit, that's where the public mailing list is meant for. 
It make take a while before issues are discussed.

Issues handling depends on the module. 
Events and LS include them in the draft itself and therefore all issues are resolved as part of the current draft cycle. 
Core include some of the issues in the draft itself, others are part of the agenda of the teleconference. 
We don't necessarily respond to the messages on the mailing lists (public or not). 
Core, LS, and Events are still working drafts (ie not in Last Call) and therefore we don't track them officially. 
This explains why we may forgot some of them sometimes even if we try not to. 
So it is always good to repost your issues if you didn't anything happening in a new draft. 
XPath has now an official list of issues since it is in Last Call. 
Issues are recorded at [1] and will receive a response. 
You can see that some of them have already been considered and decided (or declined) by the WG but the person who raised the issue didn't receive a response. 
We are still willing to consider issues for the draft even if the deadline is over but don't guarantee official response in that case (but will try to). 
HTML has also an official list but the list is now closed. 
We don't accept anymore issues on the draft until further notice. 
You can expect an update of this draft "soon". 
As an example, your issue regarding DocumentLS.saveXML was raised yesterday during an editor teleconference for Load and Save, the draft was modified to include "DocumentLS.saveXML 
saves the document or the given node and all its decendants to a string.", the issue was recorded under "LS-Issue-105", and closed. 
The delay between the message and the response may vary, depending on the editors, our priorities, and their meetings. 
DOM Level 1 Second Edition for example has a low priority on our agenda but is still part of it.

I really appreciate you taking the time to explain all that. 
Very useful information that I will carry with me. 
Good to know that my "issue" was formally "issued" and "closed." 
I can feel good about my LS implementation now.
