<s> In English it is customary to place two spaces after a period at the end of  </s>
<s> a sentence.  </s>
<s> However, current HTML browsers generally squeeze spaces into a  </s>
<s> single space, so a paragraph like this one would be displayed with only one  </s>
<s> space between sentences.  </s>
<s> Some current WYSIWYG HTML editors cover for this by changing the first space  </s>
<s> to a non-breaking space (&amp;nbsp;).  </s>
<s> This forces the browser to display two spaces.  </s>
<s> I noticed that Amaya will change the NBSP-SP sequence into two regular spaces.  </s>
<s> That is to say, if I read in a document with the NBSP-SP sequence and then save it again the sequence is changed to SP-SP.  </s>
<s> Hmmm...  </s>
<s> I admit, there may be some change to the HTML specification to cover for this somehow and I just don't know about it.  </s>
<s> Or perhaps Amaya has this behavior for some other reason to which I am not privy.  </s>
<s> So I'm not claiming  </s>

<s> Only on a typewriter, as typewriters must use monospaced fonts.  </s>
<s> In electronic typesetting, one uses an extended space after a period (I've never worked with metal type, so I don't remember if one used two en-spaces or a special double-en-space or some such piece of type).  </s>
<s> Word processors automatically extend the space after a period, as do web browsers.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest checking a book on typography out of the library if you're interested in an extended discussion of this.  </s>

<s> This is not correct behavior.  </s>
<s> The extended spacing should be handled automatically at the browser level.  </s>
<s> Probably a case of Amaya trying to cope with those WYSIWYG HTML editors and their wrongheaded support of typewriter methods in a (limited, obviously) electronic typesetting environment.  </s>

<s> I hope the above is Amaya's reasoning.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I hope this helps.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, everyone has taken typing classes, but no one who teaches keyboarding in this electronic world has ever studied or practiced electronic typesetting, so this particular bit of misinformation continues to spread (my own company wrongly uses a double space in our publications).  </s>

<s> there is no construct that yields this very common requirement.  </s>
<s> one of the main reasons is that the structure of html/css doesn't recognize a sentence as a basic block.  </s>
