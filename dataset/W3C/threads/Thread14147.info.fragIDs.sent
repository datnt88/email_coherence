<s> This is also my conclusion.  </s>
<s> All versions of Netscape are severely broken in this area, as they seem to behave as if the character repertoire is pretty much limited to the repertoire defined by the value of the "charset", and furthermore they don't seem to have implemented the character entity names.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, displaying something like &amp;gamma; unparsed, even if it isn't very attractive, is more functionally useful than displaying the wrong character (which happens on some HTML3.2-conforming browser versions, because they take the numerical value modulo 256), or an empty box.  </s>
<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> I recommend (for these kind of situations*) to compose the HTML using only US-ASCII characters, and to represent other characters by either their entity names (for Latin-1 only) or their numerical character references.  </s>
<s> If the result is advertised as UTF-8 then it is entirely valid (albeit it provokes one minor bug in MSIE4, see Netscape manages to display it.  </s>
<s> *)I mean, obviously this wouldn't be an attractive way to compose a page that was primarily in Cyrillic, Japanese or whatever.  </s>
<s> But if the page is primarily in a Latin alphabet, it's OK.  </s>
<s> That's kind of poetic.  </s>
<s> One could also supply some heavyweight javascript to tell the graphical browsers how to correct their bugs, while Lynx calmly displayed the standard HTML correctly.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from this about accessibility guidelines; I'm just trying to contribute my observations from trying to make this stuff work at all, in the available browsers.  </s>
<s> Jukka Korpela has some interesting pages on the topic (start at the URL that I cited), and is kind enough to link also to my own at Best regards  </s>
