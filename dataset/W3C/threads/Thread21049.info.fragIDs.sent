<s> Hi, I pasted about 1500 lines of source code from one document into another and when I synchronised Amaya crashed.  </s>
<s> When I started it again it knew that I had unsaved documents before the crash but it failed to find them :( Amaya 7.2+ running on Windows 2000 (I was working with source because it was not copying/pasting large blocks properly - I think it might happen if the doctypes are not the same but can't tell.  </s>
<s> It just collapses everything into one paragraph, no links, etc.  </s>
<s> The file I was copying was the lists from stuff before trying to copy) and I pasted it into a local file of about hte same size).  </s>
<s> Any clues?  </s>

<s> Hello Charles, thanks for the report.  </s>
<s> This one will not be easy to find, I will try to reproduce it.  </s>
<s> Did you paste the 1500 lines from a single operation or did you make several copy/paste ?  </s>
