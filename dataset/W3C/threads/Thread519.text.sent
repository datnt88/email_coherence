Hi folks, I am trying to "tidy" (X)HTML fragments. 
The problem is that Tidy corrects them as documents, adding html, head and body tags etc. 
I tried to prevent this using the "input-xml" option, but this disables error correction. 
Is there a way to achieve fragment correction with tidy? 
Please CC me any answers, I am not subscribed. 
Thanks for your time.

works fine Jany Jany Quintard | I always wanted to be somebody, jany.quintard@bigfoot.com

You need the updated Tidy from SourceForge for this.
