After installing 7.1 LINUX version which at least started I can not help but show my disappointment. 
The editor display is garbled and does not show the last part of the file after synchronising. 
It seems that I totally misunderstand the use of pre tags now for years. 
Mozilla changes newlines inside a pre block to br / Amaya inserts a newline after a br / on every save. 
So most of my files became unusable and had to be edited with a text editor. 
Also AMAYA forces a maximum lenght of line inside a pre tag to be about 60 chars and inserts a newline. 
NOT FUNNY ANYMORE It seems there are about 50 people left which are interested in a w3c - conformant editor. 
Jochem Heicke Could you provide an example of a file with that problem? 
That would help to understand what happens. 
Yes, I have just checked. 
That's a strange behaviour. 
I don't see any reason to make that change. 
In a pre , a newline is enough to indicate a line break and it is perfectly valid. 
Right. 
That's to make the source code more readable. 
But this is an issue within a pre , especially when Mozilla has turned all newlines into br/ elements. 
I have made a change in the CVS base. 
Newlines are no longer inserted after br/ elements within a pre . 
Are you sure? 
I have tried and the only newlines Amaya added within a pre where after the br/ (but that's fixed now). 
Vincent. 
I'm one of them. 
I need not be but I am. 
I use Amaya all day every day to write all I write: log my software development work, document programs and systems, write articles, etc. Amaya fails, it's far from being perfect. 
I could stop using it whenever I want to but I don't because of the great value it has to me. 
Having a hyperlinked web of docs is fantastic. 
Being able to write it with the same tool I read is the value. 
With TopPage I could write fancy pages but not navigate them with ease, with Netscape I always could read |or|edit| pages -only in separate windows tools-. 
Amaya is ideal for me and I appreciate it very much, and every time I have an opportunity I thank the developers, every time I find a problem I try to help solving it. 
The other 49 people do more or less the same :-) Juan Lanus TECNOSOL Argentina Jochem, Did you count me? 
(you should). 
I use Amaya for HTML editing, because it's a lot more predictable and makes simpler HTML than other tools I've tried. 
Sure, there's a lot of features I'd like, and a few bugs to get rid of, but it's being actively supported, and minor bugs are fixed pretty quickly, and I haven't seen anything better for my needs.
