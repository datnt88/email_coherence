I want to make sure that I had adequate coverage of parsers for the test review matrix. 
Java: In the past, I've run the tests (or the earlier Domunit test) on: Xerces-J 1, Xerces-J 2, Crimson, DOM4J, Oracle-J, Batik (making allowances for SVG-specificity). 
Probably should add GNUJAXP, any others. 
ECMAScript: Mozilla 0.9.+, MSXML 3.0, Adobe SVG Viewer (again making SVG allowances). 
Do Amaya, Konquerer, or others support XML DOM? 
.NET: Would love to have System.Xml from Microsoft's .NET in the matrix, but I haven't been able to spend any time with it. 
Python: Any progress on a Python binding, Fred? 
If you could transliterate even a few of the generated Java tests and get them running under PyUnit, I should be able to get the test-to-py transform done pretty quickly. 
C++: I've run Domunit with Xerces-C, but I haven't done C++ support for the DOM TS yet. 
I've never used libxml but it definitely should be supported by the suite. 
Konqueror does, as does Opera (though no methods to insert nodes into the document tree are supported). 
Amaya does not support ECMAScript ( -Dylan Schiemann Do You Yahoo!? Make a great connection at Yahoo! Personals. 
FWIW, I read http://www.opera.com/opera4/specs.html#xml as saying that Opera has very limited HTML DOM support, but never mentions XML DOM support. 
In any event, they do say: "We support the following attributes [sic, "methods" ???] in the document object: getElementsByTagName() getElementById() getElementByName() " That's pretty minimal! 
Dunno if you want to hear about partials... Xalan supports partial DOM bindings to its (non-DOM) internal data models in the Java version, and I believe in the C++ version. 
Should be close to complete for core read operations, but no mutation is permitted.

The primary motivation was to find enough distinct implementations that think they are complete and spec conformant to find any holes in the tests. 
It should be pretty simple to produce a test suite that is only read-only cases (since load has a willBeModified attribute to allow reuse of documents in ECMAScript testing). 
Does Xalan-J's DOM support JAXP? 
If not, then a JAXP adapter would need to be added to the DOM test support files.
