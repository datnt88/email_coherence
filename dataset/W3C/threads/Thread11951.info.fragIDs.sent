<s> Hello Chuck: I am vary surprised that you think that accessibility of authoring tools should be dropped.  </s>
<s> I strongly disagree.  </s>
<s> The reason I got interested in this group is because TOOLS aren't all accessible.  </s>
<s> If it wasn't for making things accessable, we wouldn't be here.  </s>
<s> I think the more we mention this, the better the accessibility of documents and authoring tools will be.  </s>
<s> Besides that, there is Also, section 4 is about a halph of a page.  </s>

<s> I agree that it should be dropped.  </s>
<s> There are plenty of excellent references on producing accessible applications.  </s>
<s> Sun, IBM, Trace and Microsoft all have guidelines for Universal Design and software applications.  </s>
<s> However, I disagree with the focus on *documents*.  </s>
<s> Okay, FrontPage 98 maybe  </s>
<s> document-centric, but Microsoft Visual InterDev produces HTML *appilcations*.  </s>
<s> It's easy to create accessible documents, but not so much so with creating HTML applications.  </s>
<s> At the User Agent Face to Face, I demonstrated the "Organize" feature of Outlook 98.  </s>
<s> This feature displays a pane in the message list area that has several and user interface controls that allow the user to filter incoming messages.  </s>
<s> This is done entirely using HTML and scripting.  </s>
<s> It's very cool because it has full keyboard support and uses fonts and colors specified by the operating system.  </s>
<s> This magic courtesy of HTML 4.0, CSS1 and Internet Explorer's rendering engine.  </s>
<s> It is possible to create accessible HTML applications, but unlike Outlook 98 developers, most folks won't spend the effort needed to hand-craft HTML.  </s>
<s> Products like Visual InterDev 6.0 allow a developer to create a complete on-line retail store easily.  </s>
<s> HTML applications, generated by authoring tools should be of primary importance to this group.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 2. It was decided that a text only view be recommended.  </s>
<s> You mean, allow the authoring tool to render the current page in text view?  </s>
<s> How practical is that?  </s>
<s> I know that FrontPage simply calls out to Internet Explorer to do it's rendering.  </s>
<s> Seems like a big work item to ask authoring tool developer to build in a text view.  </s>
<s> Each authoring tool might have a different concept of what "text view" means.  </s>
<s> Does it mean what LYNX does, or does it mean the raw HTML without all the markup and no formatting?  </s>

<s> My response: Point well taken.  </s>
<s> I think we have avoided the limiting term "document" in the actual document.  </s>
<s> The point here is to allow the author to see what it will look like with a text browser.  </s>
<s> This would not be a priority 1. Authoring tools frequently produce several views of the document, seperate from the final rendering.  </s>

<s> My point was that term "Text view" is too ambiguous.  </s>
<s> Regardless of the priority, what you mean by text view is important.  </s>
<s> To me, this group is not about making "things" accessible, it's about making sure that authoring tools generate accessible content.  </s>
<s> It's not like saying I don't want to deal with accessibility of au tools, just that it shouldn't happen here and today.  </s>
<s> Again, it's a matter of personal opinion: I think we can do a better job by focusing on this one problem.  </s>
<s> Time is of the essence, companies are rolling out new editors.  </s>
<s> The suggestion that it be dealt with in UA makes more sense to me, a AU is a UA too, one that does editing.  </s>
<s> Size has nothing to do with it, I'v seen group spend 3 months to agree on a single paragraph.  </s>
<s> As I recall it the minutes are correct.  </s>
<s> The rationale was that a default ALT value of any kind means that validating tools will not be able to determine the fact that the ALT text is not human-generated (and computers are still not very good at reading pictures, except bitmapped text) and therefore unlikely to be of much value, and that if there was a default value it would enable authors to simply rely on it instead of providing a useful value.  </s>
