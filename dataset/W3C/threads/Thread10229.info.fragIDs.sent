<s> A few trivial nitpicks.  </s>
<s> Appendix A actually anticipates the only issue I have with this document (although it basically says, "there is an issue, we don't deal with it").  </s>
<s> 1. Introduction Figure 1 already includes the denotation/addressing issue I raised in the schema review.  </s>
<s> Is it purely accidental that Eric Miller's mailbox is named by a URI that also lets you address mail to him?  </s>
<s> I'd guess not.  </s>
<s> What are the conventions governing the use of such "suggestive" addressing names?  </s>
<s> In other words, why does this figure have the following triple:  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox mailto:em@w3.org .  </s>
<s> and not this: http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a rdf:type eg:Mailbox .  </s>
<s> _:a rdfx:uri "mailto:em@w3.org"^^ xsd:uri .  </s>
<s> or this (or some variant?) http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox "mailto:em@w3.org" .  </s>
<s> [Come to think of it, why a mailto: and not an imap: url?]  </s>
<s> Following on from the example: "unlike conventional hypertext, RDF URIs can refer to any identifiable thing, including things that may not be directly retrievable on the Web" OK so far, but are there any distinguishing characteristics that can tell one kind of URI from another?  </s>
<s> (I note that this issue is addressed to some extent in Appendix A.) 2.1 Basic Concepts The example is good, again, but has this: "In this statement, we've used the Web page's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to identify it."  </s>
<s> OK, but how do I know that's what you've done?  </s>
<s> Is there some convention, or some magic associated with the domain of the creator property?  </s>
<s> In other words, there appears to be some restriction on valid interpretations of this statement that's got something to do with the URL labelling a resource being the address of a web page.  </s>
<s> I don't think this is articulated anywhere.  </s>
<s> I won't belabour this point though.  </s>
<s> Nitpick: "the object is the words..." should be "the object is the phrase" (currently doesn't agree on number)  </s>
<s> 2.2 and onwards.  </s>
<s> I like this.  </s>
<s> The document in general is an easy read, the pictures are colourful and straight-forward, and there are lots of examples.  </s>
<s> The narrative structure is good and the whole thing smacks of eloquence and polish.  </s>
<s> A very nice job.  </s>
<s> Namespace prefix definitions: there's an example which includes - ex:index.html  </s>
<s> dc:creator exstaff:85740 .  </s>
<s> Again, this tacitly ignores the fact that ex:index.html  </s>
<s> appears to name a web page, and exstaff:85740 appears to name a person; but they both look like URLs to me.  </s>
<s> I don't hold the primer at fault here, because this goes on a lot in RDF in the wild (it seems) - I'd be satisfied with some way of telling which was which.  </s>
<s> 2.3, Figure 6 explanatory text: This is not a bad stab at explaining the graph-specific identity of blank nodes in a "see spot run" stylee :-) In addition, there follows some excellent text about not using things that look like URLs to name things that don't have URLs (eg, people).  </s>
<s> This is a really important idea (blank nodes everywhere?) and it's introduced well.  </s>
<s> Hopefully it won't get lost in passing.  </s>
<s> In fact, it's worthwhile considering if this idea (obvious as it may seem) isn't worth extracting into a separate note, because it's really, really important, and Eric and Frank have done a good job of explaining it.  </s>
<s> 2.5.  </s>
<s> Concepts summary Nitpick (numbering format change in heading)  </s>
<s> 4.1 RDF Containers Example 14 and Figure 15 contains example1.org  </s>
<s> and example2.org  </s>
<s> domains: are these reserved for example use?  </s>
<s> How about ftp1.example.org,  </s>
<s> etc?  </s>
<s> 4.4 rdf:value I'm really uncertain whether rdf:value deserves the excellent treatment here.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that other modelling approaches are more likely to be successful in the long run (eg, factoring units into the property definitions, so "exterms:weight" is defined as "weight in kilogrammes"), although I'm ready to be set straight on that point (I've a sneaking suspicion that there may be reasonable counterexamples in the iCalendar world).  </s>
<s> I'd like at least to see an alternative mentioned (although perhaps the primer isn't the place for this).  </s>
<s> 5.3 Interpreting RDF Schema Declarations Another eloquent exposition of an important thesis.  </s>
<s> Last paragraph is one of those that'd definitely have to be in one of those mythical cut-down "views" of the primer text :-) 6.1 Dublin Core The dc:subject is an rdf:Bag in the example.  </s>
<s> I'm _still_ not sure what this means, particularly given the description of rdf containers previously in the document (the prose related to the example in 4.1 concerning a rules committee would seem to imply that the rdf:Bag should not have been used).  </s>
<s> I seem to recall discussing this around in circles before now; I don't recall the conclusion.  </s>
<s> 6.2 PRISM "For example, dc:date is extended by properties like prism:publicationTime, ..." Technically, isn't it restricted or constrained, not extended?  </s>
<s> Maybe "speciali[sz]ed"?  </s>
<s> Appendix A. "People sometimes use RDF together with a convention that, when a URIref is used to identify an RDF resource, a page containing descriptive information about that resource will be placed on the web "at" that URI...However, this convention is not an explicit part of the definition of RDF, and RDF itself does not assume that a URIref identifies something that can be retrieved."  </s>
<s> Fair enough, and perhaps this is all the RDF specs need to say on the subject, but since there's a "Web" in "the Semantic Web" I'd hope that someone, somewhere, is going to say more about this (TAG?).  </s>
<s> Summary: I really like this.  </s>
<s> It's quite a dense document and I'll be reading it again to see if there's anything I've missed (third time lucky?); thumbs-up to publish.  </s>

<s> Jan-- Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> More detailed responses below.  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> This example originated with Eric if I remember correctly, so perhaps he was doing some real subtle stuff that I'm not picking up on in the following.  </s>
<s> But the short answer is that, although I think you have an important issue (or issues) here, we're not trying to get at it (them) yet.  </s>
<s> After all, we're only three paragraphs into the real Primer text here.  </s>
<s> More specifically: a. a mailto: URI is the first thing I would think of when called on to identify a mailbox, which is what we're doing b. it nicely gives us an early example where a URI is a statement's object (although we unfortunately don't build on this example as much as we might have, something Brian pointed out earlier) c. we don't use the blank node thingie because (i) it would make the graph more complicated, for a reason I don't think we're prepared to get into at this point, and (ii) I don't want to show a graph at this point with an unlabelled node (labeled graphs are new enough at this point, people might think it was a typo, and we don't get to blank nodes until much further along).  </s>
<s> As far as I know, there aren't any such distinguishing characteristics, and I frankly think that's a good thing.  </s>
<s> Could you clarify?  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, you know that's what I've done because I've just told you.  </s>
<s> I don't expect you to have to infer anything from the creator property.  </s>
<s> Remember, we started off with the sentence "Imagine that we want to state the fact that someone named John Smith created a particular Web page."  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the URL of the page is the obvious way to refer to it, I used the URL in the statement, and then I pointed out that I did that.  </s>
<s> One thing I'm trying to do here is gradually introduce the idea of URIs being used to identify things in RDF, and the obvious starting point is for the things being identified to be Web pages, where it's hard to imagine anything *but* URIs being used to identify them.  </s>
<s> I didn't have anything like this in mind in that example.  </s>
<s> I can see that the number doesn't agree; it didn't occur to me that "John Smith" was technically a phrase.  </s>
<s> But I'll do something about this.  </s>
<s> I don't know that I agree about telling which was which, but that's a deeper issue than we need to go into right now.  </s>
<s> Anyway, as you say, there's a lot of existing RDF that does this sort of thing.  </s>
<s> Do you mean that this one has a period after the number and other ones don't?  </s>
<s> If so, that inconsistency appears in other places too.  </s>
<s> I'll clean this up.  </s>
<s> No reservation that I know of.  </s>
<s> I'll fix this.  </s>
<s> There are certainly other approaches (one I suggested was to have different data types for the weight in different units, but there were objections to that).  </s>
<s> I think we've beaten rdf:value to death; we could certainly have a longer discussion of why it's there, and alternatives to using it, but I think writing that discussion would unnecessarily delay things.  </s>
<s> Actually, I think the DC example is more like the "publications" example in 4.1 than the rules committee example.  </s>
<s> In the publication case, the question is whether it is accurate to say that someone published a group of things, rather than each individual thing separately.  </s>
<s> Here, the question is whether it is accurate to say that the subject of the web page is a group (of individual subject descriptors), rather than each subject separately.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I want to discuss this any further in the Primer, certainly not right now.  </s>
<s> I will say that this sort of thing raises some questions about its impact on using RDF in data integration applications where a fully normalized structure is important, and a vanilla RDF app, not knowing that something like "subject" should distribute over the members of the Bag, doesn't recognize common structures when it should.  </s>
<s> I think it might be more accurate to say something like "more precise variants of dc:date are provided by properties like ...".  </s>
<s> I wouldn't want to say restricted, constrained, or specialized, unless I knew there was a subProperty relationship actually defined (I'd need to check the PRISM spec).  </s>
<s> Hopefully the TAG.  </s>
<s> After all, we can say whatever we want, but it only has normative effect in RDF (and not even that if it's only said in the Primer!). Thanks again, --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
<s> Jan, am I right in reading this as a thumbs up for last call publication without change, i.e. no showstoppers.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> On this document, yes.  </s>
<s> I think the issue that appendix A deals with (what name do you give to a web resource, and what does a URL name?) probably needs some clarification, and RDFCore seems one place to look for that clarification - even if we jsut raise the matter as something for TAG to pronounce on.  </s>
