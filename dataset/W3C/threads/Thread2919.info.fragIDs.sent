<s> As Barb indicated in her posting, the meeting to discuss the TLS protocol is set for Wednesday, May 29th at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto, California.  </s>
<s> In order to ensure we have a large enough meeting room, please send me an RSVP by 5/24.  </s>
<s> Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding accommodations, transportation, etc. Tom Stephens tomste@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> Tom, Two questions about the meeting on May 29: 1. Do you have particular expectations of the participants?  </s>
<s> For example, you might expect them to have read the 4/8 Microsoft paper and be familiar with SSL V2, SSL V3, and PC V1 specifications.  </s>
<s> How about PCT V2? Hannah?  </s>
<s> A list such as used by recent W3C Security work group meetings might be useful to avoid making it a grand education session.  </s>
<s> 2. Do you have an agenda?  </s>
<s> Or a prioritized list of discussion topics?  </s>
<s> Looking at the notes that preceeded the announcement of this meeting does not help much.  </s>
<s> (I have some ideas, you may have a different list.) Thanks - Mark  </s>
<s> Mark, I hope to post a list of proposed discussion topics within the next couple of days.  </s>
<s> This list will be compiled from the topics raised on this list to date.  </s>
<s> If you or anyone else wishes to suggest topics for discussion which have not yet been posted to the list, then please post your suggestions and I will incorporate them into the document.  </s>
<s> On the morning of 5/29, the meeting attendees can decide which of the topics should be addressed at the meeting given the limited amount of time we have available to us.  </s>
<s> Location: Garden Court Hotel 520 Cowper Street Palo Alto, California Schedule: 0800 - 0830, Continental breakfast 0830 - 1200, Morning session 1200 - 1300, Lunch 1300 - 1500, Early afternoon session 1500 - 1530, Afternoon break 1530 - 1700, Late afternoon session/wrap-up  </s>
