I was disappointed to find absolutely no mention of math rendering in the new guideline document posted by the user agent group. 
I asked John Gunderson, and he suggested that I write this group. 
I believe that math is a very important topic for this group to discuss. 
I find it ironic that mathML may actually reduce access to math. 
My group will be testing some bandaid solutions to math and graphics access on Oregon State University web courses during the next year. 
These are crude but they can provide access for math that is represented as graphic images. 
Once mathML begins to appear, we are unable to make it accessible. 
Perhaps a more clever person than I can figure out how to do it, but I see no practical way to access mathML except by the user agent.

Can you elaborate ? 
Are you saying the MathML language doesn't enable acessibility (say by voice or braille), or that your current solution doesn't work with MathML ? 
or something else ? 
MathML should be very accessible, but one needs access either to the source mathML or, better still, the parsed mathML in order to produce a non-visual display. 
If you give me those I can display them, but if you don't I can't. 
I'm still confused. 
It's important that we understand your point, so let me ask again. 
MathML is a simple W3C XML tagset, and access to the specification is public (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML). 
Access to the source of the documents using MathML on the Web should be fairly similar to access to source of documents using HTML today: MathML is the format being sent by the server, so if you're a UA, you have it, if you're a user, your UA should give you a "Show Page Source" menu to give access to it. 
Access to the parsed MathML should come thru an API like DOM (W3C Document Object Model), which works with XML in general. 
What is your issue then ? 
MathML should be very accessible, but one needs access either to the source mathML or, better still, the parsed mathML in order to produce a non-visual display. 
If you give me those I can display them, but if you don't I can't. 
John Oh my. 
This all started because I didn't understand how your user agent guidelines could be expanded to include good access to math, and I was hoping that the group could enlighten me. 
Please correct me if I misunderstand, but your recommendations are apparently a list of user options and a list of good practices to ensure that user agents work well with access technologies. 
I can personally imagine only one way that your paradigm can include math. 
That is to give the user an option to represent the math in a linear form. 
Screen readers can be given a symbol dictionary that will pronounce the math and markup symbols correctly. 
There sure are many better ways to display math in audio than this (ask Raman). 
But none of the methods I know or can imagine can be accomplished in your user option/access technology paradigm. 
So apparently it is I, not daniel, who is confused. 
Please enlighten me.
