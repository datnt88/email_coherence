<s> Hello Jacob, I have just had a short look at this.  </s>
<s> A few comments.  </s>
<s> I don't understand what multipart/choices is for.  </s>
<s> There are implementation problems for multipart/alternative, but they don't get fixed by proposing something new.  </s>
<s> They can (and should) just be fixed asap, which is easier than to implement something new.  </s>
<s> Please also note that the 'selector' parameter is very similar to the 'differences' parameter proposed in RFC 1766 (e.g. http://www.innosoft.com/rfc/rfc1766.html), which yet has to take on.  </s>
<s> It would at least be worthwhile to use the  </s>
<s> same name.  </s>
<s> For ftp://ftp.dsv.su.se/users/jpalme/draft-palme-email-translation-02.txt, it says "All of these methods of transmitting information is based on the assumption that all language versions are ready and available when a message is sent.".  </s>
<s> This is clearly wrong, because it doesn't apply to http.  </s>
<s> It may also be worth mentioning that some formats, in particular SVG (http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SwitchElement) and SMIL (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/#switch), have a switch construct that allows to display one of the languages contained in the document.  </s>
<s> The provisions regarding the "Content-Translator" header field: The "Content-Translator" header field indicates who made the translation.  </s>
<s> When a translation is submitted, the "From" header field should still indicate the original author, but the "Content-Translator" header field can indicate who made the translation.  </s>
<s> are very scary, because they will produce very misleading impression on user agents that don't understand Content-Translator (namely that the mail came from the original sender).  </s>
<s> Things should be turned around, so that such an impression is not possible.  </s>
<s> In general, I think that translations, in particular incremental ones, fit much better with the Web paradigm than with the message paradigm.  </s>
<s> It might be better to get some more actual experience on the Web side rather than to try to force things into messaging.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> I suggest that further discussion of this is done in the "langtrans" mailing list.  </s>
<s> To subscribe to this list, send a message containing the text sub langtrans your name, not your e-mail address to listserv@su.se  </s>
<s> I have written a more complete reply to Martin's message in that mailing list.  </s>
