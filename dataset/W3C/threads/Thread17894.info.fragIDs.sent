<s> Hello, Per my action item of 2 May [1], please consider this proposed rewording for checkpoint 7.6 (about structured navigation).  </s>
<s> [1] 7.6 Allow the user to navigate according to structure.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For example, allow the user to navigate familiar elements of a document: document headings, paragraphs, tables and table cells, lists, etc. Note.  </s>
<s> Use operating system conventions to indicate navigation progress (e.g., selection or content focus).  </s>
<s> 7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important pieces of content identified by the author.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] User agents should allow users to: 1) Navigate to a piece of content that the author has identified as important according to the markup language specification and conventional usage.  </s>
<s> In HTML, for example, this includes headings, forms, tables, navigation mechanisms, and lists.  </s>
<s> 2) Navigate past that piece of content (i.e., avoid the details of that component).  </s>
<s> 3) Navigate into that piece of content (i.e., chose to view the details of that component).  </s>
<s> Structured navigation is most effective when available in conjunction with a configurable view (checkpoints 8.5 and 8.6).  </s>
<s> Users should be able to navigate to important pieces of content within a configurable view, identify the type of object they have navigated to, interact with that object easily (if its an active element), and recall the surrounding context (orient themselves).  </s>
<s> Techniques (in conjunction with the existing techniques and those mentioned in the References listed below).  </s>
<s> User agents should construct the navigation view with the goal of breaking onolithic content into sensible pieces according to the author's design.  </s>
<s> In most cases, user agents should not break down content into individual elements for navigation; element by element navigation of the document object does not meet the goal of facilitating navigation to important pieces of content.  </s>
<s> Instead, user agents are expected to construct the navigation view from author-supplied markup.  </s>
<s> For those languages with known conventions for identifying important components, user agents should construct the navigation tree from those components, allowing users to navigate to them, skip them, or navigate into them.  </s>
<s> In HTML, important elements including headings, tables, forms, DIV elements (notably with a "title" attribute set), navigation mechanisms (marked up with MAP), and lists.  </s>
<s> HTML also allows authors to specify keyboard configurations (accesskey, tabindes), which can serve as hints about what the author considers important.  </s>
<s> Tables and forms illustrate the utility of a recursive navigation mechanism.  </s>
<s> The user should be able to navigate to tables, then change "scope" and navigate within the cells of that table.  </s>
<s> Nested tables fit nicely within this scheme.  </s>
<s> The same ideas apply to forms: users should be able to navigate to a form, then among the controls within that form.  </s>
<s> In SVG, the "g" element signifies a grouping and should be considered when constructing the navigation view.  </s>
<s> In SMIL, "par", "seq", and "switch" provide information that may be useful for identifying significant components of content.  </s>
<s> Users should be able to configure the navigation view as they go, expanding and contracting portions of content that they wish to examine or ignore.  </s>
<s> This will speed up navigation and promote orientation at the same time.  </s>
<s> Notes: - The term "important" is used in WCAG 1.0 [2]: "Information in a document is important if understanding that information is crucial to understanding the document."  </s>
<s> This is not quite the meaning intended here, I believe.  </s>
<s> As I have understood the WG's discussions, the goal is to be able to reach "blocks" of content, not "information" that is semantically important.  </s>
<s> We might assume that blocks of content are generally semantically important, but that cannot be guaranteed.  </s>
<s> For instance "DIV" may be used purely to provide a green background to some content, and DIV is a block element.  </s>
<s> [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#glossary - This checkpoint looks a lot like the "chunk navigation" checkpoint we used to have, though this one is a little more general.  </s>

<s> How about: 7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important structural elements defined by the author.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] The other parts look good.  </s>

<s> I think we need to assume that blocks of content are considered by the author an important indication of some type of information, given the nature of how HTML is actually used in practice.  </s>
<s> Hopefully there will be better usage of markup to make it clearer what is really important.  </s>
