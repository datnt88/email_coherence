<s> Are they different by intention or by mistake?  </s>
<s> If the quoted passage shall remain: Is it also intended to raise an exception if prefix and namespace URI are both null or an empty string?  </s>

<s> removeAttribute is Level 1.  </s>
<s> In Level 1, removing an attribute that doesn't exist is a no-op.  </s>
<s> I don't think we can change that now without risk of breaking existing code.  </s>
<s> Given that precedent, I'd rather have removeAttributeNS be consistant with removeAttribute than with the NamedNodeMap.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> What about a 'supports' attribute to allow a more flexible reaction?  </s>
<s> (That might also be a solution for some namespace problems discussed in other threads.)  </s>
<s> Consequence: When coding the API I cannot easily use a NamedNodeMap to store the attributes of an element.  </s>
<s> Well, I can catch the exception, but that is neither elegant nor fast.  </s>

<s> That's one solution.  </s>
<s> If we assume that removing a nonexistant attribute is an uncommon action -- which is probably true -- performance is probably not a major concern; you only pay a penalty if the exception must be thrown and caught.  </s>
<s> Another approach is to check whether the named item is present in the NamedNodeMap before you remove it.  </s>
<s> Another approach is to provide yourself with a private mechanism that doesn't throw the exception.  </s>
<s> What a DOM implementation publishes to the outside world, and what it looks like internally, may be very different things.  </s>
<s> There are existing Level 1 DOM implementations that handle this case successfully.  </s>
<s> "If it happens, it must be possible."  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> But then the remove-routine of the namedNodeMap would check that again.  </s>
<s> Well, we can define any divergent behavior and code it separately.  </s>
<s> But would it not be appropriate when similar things would work alike?  </s>
<s> Similar behavior might make the DOM more pleasant for the end user, too.  </s>

<s> We can make the namespaced Level 2 method similar to the NamedNodeMap only at the cost of breaking similarity with the non-namespace Level 1 method.  </s>
