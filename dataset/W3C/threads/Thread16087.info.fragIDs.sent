William: This is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the ADA applies to any federal government agency. 
Rehab Act, yes; ADA, no. 
By the way, I have no quibble with using Title II of the ADA to require internet access to activities and programs of state and local governments. 
"Public Entity" is defined in Title II of the ADA statute as: SEC. 
201. 
DEFINITION. 
As used in this title: (1) Public entity.--The 
term "public entity" means-- (A) any State or local government; (B) any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government; and (C) the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act). 
We have a perfectly servicable law (the Rehab Act) to apply to the federal government. 
It's a waste of time to try to apply the ADA to the federal government. 
One person's "waste" is another person's exercise of liberty. 
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explciitly demands equal protection under the law for all citizens. 
Though Congress has managed to maintain certain exemptions from *enforcement* of various laws, personal and civil liability court actions are not among them - viz. 
U.S. Supreme Court decision in case Clinton v. Jones. 
any Accessibility agent or agency for local, state, and federal agencies should become aware of the larger principles of law and justice. 
According to the 14th Amendment, the law which most comprehensively provides accessibility for Americans with Disabilities would be ruled applicable in court - whether ADA or other law. 
Amendment 14 "Section 1. 
All persons born or naturalized inthe United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. 
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the Unites States; nor shall nay State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within the jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
Greg Rice 
MM: "Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to the Federal government" WL:: SEC. 
202. 
DISCRIMINATION. 
Subject to the provisions of this title, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. 
You aren't "splitting hairs" but you should recognize why we insist that Title II of ADA quoted above is relevant and applicable. 
As to case law, Randy Tamez &amp; Kelly Pierce have an action in process which has been widely discussed on the WAI and WebWatch lists.

Internet World, www.iw.com, does not have a section or reporter devoted to accessibility. 
This is such a critical issue for People With Disabilities (PWD) and also with the Federal, State and Local governments that are required to maintain sites and web applications that are in compliance with the American Disabilities Act. 
As a subscriber, I also ask that when you offer opinions on web sites as is done in InternetWorld - my apologies for not remembering the column where two people offer advice on what they liked and disliked - that you include a another person's input on Accessibility. 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 202.208.7270 
Robert Neff Here is a copy of an email that is pertinent to the discussion. 
I sent this to InternetWeek who is sponsoring the BOTI. 
TO: Managing Editor and Debbie Rizzo No where in the BOTI competition (article enclosed below) is there a category for web sites OR web applications designed to be accessible to everyone. 
I would like to think that for each category (one through eleven) there could be two sub categories: one where designers and companies are not concerned with accessibility and the second for those web sites and web applications that are accessible to everyone to include People With Disabilities (PWDs). 
For your information, the American Disabilities Act requires Federal, State and Local governments to be accessible to everyone. 
I would hope that this category could be included. 
As a subscriber, I am interested in accessibility because my customer is a Federal Agency. 
As a matter of fact, I have not seen Accessibility 
addressed. 
I would hope that a leading internet magazine that covers the internet would be concerned about the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), www.w3c.org/wai and its attempts to publish page authoring guidelines for designers and its education and outreach program. 
I ask that Internet Week support a section DEDICATED to Accessibility. 
I think you could convince your sponsors of this need because PWDs are a marketable audience that use the web to purchase products and obtain information. 
If they can't access the web site, then they cannot purchase their product or review information! 
Many of us would be more than willing to provide insight. 
Here are some examples for some articles. 
a. Interview a person who is blind and let him/her show you how they access the web. 
b. Interview a person who is deaf and let him/her show you how they access the web. 
c. Interview a person with low vision person and let him/her show you how they access the web. 
d. Interview a person who is quadriplegic and let him/her show you how they access the web. 
e. 
Interview Judy Brewer, Chair of the WAI. 
f. Review the software PWDs use to access the web. 
g. Review a web site for accessibility on a weekly basis.

Government Computer News, www.gcn.com, does not have a section or reporter devoted to accessibility on the internet. 
This is such a critical issue for People With Disabilities (PWD) and also with the Federal, State and Local governments that are required to maintain web sites and web applications that are in compliance with the American Disabilities Act. 
Furthermore, I find this to be ironic, GCN is a published for people in the 
Federal State and local government, yet the GCN web site is itself a barrier to accessibility. 
That is, by using frames your web site is a barrier to PWDs and everyone else. 
For example, you cannot bookmark pages which is a constant source of frustration because I need to navigate each time from the beginning; and frames do not print pages the same across all browsers; and saving files can be a problem. 
I commend you on the foresight to use NOFRAMES ; however, the site is still frustrating to use. 
I encourage other personnel copied to review this web site and render their opinion.

Hello: I hope this doesn't seem like I'm splitting hairs, but the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to the Federal government. 
Agencies of the Federal government are covered under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
Section 504 does contain requirements for communication access similar to those found in Title II of the ADA.

WAI IG: First a note of caution on the use of cc's with this list. 
The WAI IG is a large list &amp; we need to use some restraint to not generate an unnecessary volume of mail. 
When you cc a message to WAI IG &amp; also to other addresses, any of the subsequent discussion may end up on the IG list. 
That's not its purpose, &amp; not fair to the other subscribers. 
So please refrain from cc'ing mail except where to specifically bring a comment to the attention to someone already in the WAI IG. And if someone else does a broadcast cc, please drop the cc's from your reply. 
If WAI IG is cc'd on a small number of replies to this exchange, please just disregard it. 
If it becomes a significant problem, we will close the list to non-subscriber mail.

Hi Mike, No it doesn't sound like splitting hairs. 
However, the US Federal Government is very clearly covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which applies to all Information Technology (IT) procurement by the Federal Government, and, by extension through the "Tech Act," Section 508 applies to State Government IT procurement as well. 
So there is no lack of obligation in the US for Federal &amp; State entities to have their Web sites accessible. 
Robert, since Mike Muehe's message as well as yours went to the large cc field, you may want to follow up with those folks -- separately from this list please -- to provide further clarification as needed.
