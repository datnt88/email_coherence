<s> Ouch.  </s>
<s> The text from 14.18 probably should have said "end-to-end message", since it does seem to be ambiguous (although one might believe that the word "originated" implies "origin server", this is clearly open to misinterpretation).  </s>
<s> There is also text in 13.2.3 saying: HTTP/1.1 requires origin servers to send a Date header, if possible, with every response, giving the time at which the response was generated (see section 14.18).  </s>
<s> We use the term "date_value" to denote the value of the Date header, in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.  </s>
<s> I think the lack of clarity may reflect the assumption that all responses carry a Date from the origin server, and so we just assumed that proxies wouldn't be adding them except when specifically required by 14.18.  </s>

<s> What's the proper behaviour here?  </s>
<s> It's hard to define "proper behaviour" for HTTP/1.0 caches, since the HTTP/1.1 spec doesn't formally apply to them, and the HTTP/1.0 spec wasn't very detailed in this area.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 compliant proxies, based on 13.5.1,  </s>
<s> SHOULD NOT modify Date headers (i.e., not without a very good reason, and I can't think of any right now).  </s>
<s> And 13.5.3  </s>
<s> clearly says that HTTP/1.1-compliant proxies MUST update the Date of a stored cache entry upon validation.  </s>
<s> So if the "some Web caches" you refer to are claiming to be HTTP/1.1 implementations, these are in violation of the spec.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we're stuck with the history of HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Depends on if you read the request header or their marketing material.  </s>
<s> *grin* Most cache vendors will say that they implement "all of the important parts of 1.1" without actually claiming compliance.  </s>
<s> In reality, they support a few 1.1 features, while formally stating that they're 1.0.  </s>
<s> To be fair, Caches probably have the hardest job to implement 1.1.  </s>
