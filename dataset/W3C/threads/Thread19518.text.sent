Could Amaya please allow the author to add ALT for AREAs, in the same way it does for IMG? 
Also, it would be nice to have a default configuration which provides keyboard shortcuts for most functions and a way of doing everything including changing the active sub-window and selecting text via the keyboard All the menu functions are accessible from the keyboard via the F10 (linux) or ALT (windows) keys, and in Linux using fvwm2 I can move the mouse cursor around using ctrl-shift and the arrow keys, but haven't found a way to make clicks from the keyboard. 
For a blind user, moving the mouse around to find things is difficult anyway - if it were more like the dialog boxes, where I can use TAB, arrow keys and SPACE to do everything it would be better.

It will be the case in the next release 2.0. 
ALT will be mandatory for AREAs. 
The problem is to find out the right list of shortcuts. 
That could be experimented out of the team. 
We're ready to publish a list of files amaya.keyboard or amaya.kb. 
By the way, we plan the replace in the Windows versions the ESC key by the F2 key to select enclosing elements. 
What do you think? 
We're looking at this problem, but we're not sure to fix it for the end of this week.

Hi, F2 key to select enclosing elements. 
What do you think? 
ESC is ok. 
Why do you want to change it? 
Much more important is to select text with shift combinations like shift-home, shift page up, ... a br is normally inserted with shift return and not ctrl return. 
For me that's much more annoying in the Windows version. 
In general most of my HTML work is done with amaya because it does not support any special browser enhancements. 
When the next version is available via CVS I will surely try to compile it myself.

I don't use windows enough to know for certain, but it seems like a good idea. 
(It is easy enough to reconfigure it anyway). 
It would be nice to have the option of selecting the 'windows' interface or the 'unix' interface keyboard file, for people who are swapping across platforms.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Yes, that is a nice idea, being able to set platform x to look like plaform y as much as possible as far as the interface is concerned, for x,y in {unix, windows, mac}. 
As someone who regularly types Pico commands into vi and vice versa, and "ls -l" at DOS prompts, I have to second this :-) Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk the key to select enclosing elements. 
What do you think? 
As a Windows user, I find "Esc" very unnatural. 
It is a key I expect to use to close or cancel things. 
F2 seems much more logical. 
I agree with these. 
These are very common features in Windows applications (especially the keyboard shortcuts for selection) and Amaya would be more user-friendly (on Windows) if it used these conventions. 
I use Amaya because of it's functionality, which I think is very good, but I wish the interface had a Windows feel. 
At the moment it feels like a Unix port.

What do you think? 
There are 2 classes of Amaya users: Those who primarily use Windows boxes, and would like it to look like a native Windows app; and those (like me), who like the fact that Amaya feels the same on both Windows and UNIX, making our lives tremendously easier. 
I see no solution short of having two sets of bindings: one Windows like, and one UNIX like. 
These bindings could share quite a bit, but be different in some respects. 
So I see nothing short of letting the user do the bindings the way they wantas a good long term solution, and sending out (at least 2) bindings that users can choose from.

key to select enclosing elements. 
What do you think? 
Because on Windows, ESC cancels a Dialog Window. 
For example, if you open the Style/Character Style menu and you press the ESC key, the dialog Box will disappear. 
It's about to be done I'd suggest at least 3 bindings ;-) 1) windows-conform 2) unix-conform 3) amaya-conform (means best of the 2 worlds as a suggestion) I believe that both windows and unix can be improved. 
and the "amaya-bindings" could be such an experimental GUI. 
just an idea ... roland While we're on the topic, is there any 'official' page describing this exciting new version? 
I'd love to see generic XML/CSS support, and Amaya seems like it was pretty well built for it, but don't know how to find out if that's likely.

The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html lists all new developments included in each public release. 
As we plan to publish a very new version next Monday, we'll certainly list the most interesting new features in the Amaya home page. 
We first experimented specific XML/CSS support and Namespace. 
We're able to mix in the same document XHTML, MathML and GraphML (our SVG experimental DTD) elements and we can apply CSS rules to all these elements. 
Our new plan is to support generic XML/CSS, but it needs some additional work. 
We'll have it by the end of this year. 
Regards Irene.
