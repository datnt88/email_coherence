Since TITLE is part of anchors, couldn't TITLE just be the TITLE in the HEADER block of the document that the anchor references? 
This seems very straight forward and the user would not need to think abut it to much if the TITLE has aready been defined in the other document. 
Authoring tools could also easily use the TITLE information of the referenced document to fill in the TITLE statement automatically without the author even needing to know about it. 
ALT text would be a description of the image.

That would mean that when the first page is loaded (the one that contains the link to the second page) a fetch would have to be made to all the pages referenced to pull the TITLE out. 
Bad on performance.

Response made with JRG: JRG: This could be an option in the browser, but an author or authoring tool could use just look at the title in the header of a URL (either electronically or with a browser) and insert the title text in the TITLE attribute of the ANCHOR element. 
People were discussing simple usage strategies for TITLE, ALT and LONGDESC. 
This seemed to be one option that I thought would be good for the TITLE attribute.

I think Jon was thinking more in terms of authoring tools that of browsers, although both options are possible. 
The issue with authoring tools is that pages the might be authored off-line and the "automaric title extraction" is not possible, otherwise, it could be nice addition as it can help validating the link going out of a page at authoring time. 
It is an easy rule for people to remember when people are hand coding the TITLE attribute of an ANCHOR. 
There is no ambiguty on what to put in the TITLE attribute. 
Just put the TITLE in the HEADER block of the referenced document. 
This would be easy to explain in the guidelines. 
ALT text could be a short description of the image (icon, logo, picture) or the purpose of the image (chart, graph, map). 
LONGDESC would be an interpretation of the image.
