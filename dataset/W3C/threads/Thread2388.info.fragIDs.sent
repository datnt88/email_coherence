<s> I do not consider myself to be a Cookie expert; in fact, I avoid them like the plague.  </s>

<s> draftyness issues.  </s>
<s> HTTP State Management Mechanism (Rev1)  </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to have " (Rev1)" in the title.  </s>
<s> 2. TERMINOLOGY The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC 2068].  </s>
<s> Host name (HN) means either the host domain name (HDN) or the numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host.  </s>
<s> The fully qualified domain name is preferred; use of numeric IP addresses is strongly discouraged.  </s>
<s> A comment should be included regarding support (or non-support) of IPv6 addresses [we got pinged on this for the URI draft].  </s>
<s> In general, I find the terminology section more confusing than useful, even though I do know what is intended.  </s>
<s> I find it unlikely that anyone not involved in the mailing list discussions would have a clue as to what is being described.  </s>
<s> It would be better to postpone the description of hostname dot comparison until it can be described as part of the matching algorithm.  </s>
<s> 4. OUTLINE  </s>
<s> Why is the entire protocol specification under the section "OUTLINE"?  </s>
<s> We outline here a way for an origin server to send state information to the user agent, and for the user agent to return the state information to the origin server.  </s>
<s> The goal is to have a minimal impact on HTTP and user agents.  </s>
<s> Only origin servers that need to maintain sessions would suffer any significant impact, and that impact can largely be confined to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, unless the server provides more sophisticated state management support.  </s>
<s> (See Implementation Considerations, below.)  </s>
<s> CGI has nothing to do with it.  </s>
<s> "particular resource namespaces" would be more accurate.  </s>
<s> ", unless the server provides more sophisticated state management support" says nothing.  </s>
<s> A user agent returns a Cookie request header (see below) to the origin server if it chooses to continue a session.  </s>
<s> The origin server may ignore it or use it to determine the current state of the session.  </s>
<s> It may send back to the client a Set-Cookie2 response header with the same or different information, or it may send no Set-Cookie2 header at all.  </s>
<s> The origin server effectively ends a session by sending the client a Set-Cookie2 header with Max-Age=0.  </s>
<s> A user agent never returns a Cookie request header field -- it *sends* a Cookie request header field containing a field value matching that of a previously received Set-Cookie response header field.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a server never "sends back" a Set-Cookie2 response header field; it either sends a Set-Cookie2 or it doesn't.  </s>
<s> Much of this discussion is unnecessarily confusing.  </s>
<s> I think it would be better to define the cookie exchange protocol as a state machine,  </s>
<s> rather than enumerate in prose all of the optional behavior of each party at any given time in the exchange.  </s>
<s> For example, I find the TCP specification to be less confusing even though it describes a much more complex state machine than is implicit in the cookies protocol.  </s>
<s> 4.2.2 Set-Cookie2 Syntax The syntax for the Set-Cookie2 response header is set-cookie = "Set-Cookie2:" cookies cookies = 1#cookie cookie = NAME "=" VALUE *(";" set-cookie-av) NAME = attr VALUE = value set-cookie-av = "Comment" "=" value | "CommentURL" "=" " http_URL " | "Discard" | "Domain" "=" value | "Max-Age" "=" value | "Path" "=" value | "Port" [ "=" " 1#portnum " ] | "Secure" | "Version" "=" 1*DIGIT portnum = 1*DIGIT  </s>
<s> Unless you wish to define the precedence of "|" in your BNF, each of the set-cookie-av need to be grouped in parentheses.  </s>
<s> The origin server should send the following additional HTTP/1.1 response headers, depending on circumstances: * To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie2 header: Cache-control: no- cache="set-cookie2".  </s>
<s> This type of example should not be allowed to break across a line.  </s>
<s> There are many other areas where the text translation needs to be fixed for a final draft.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 servers must send Expires: old-date (where old-date is a date long in the past) on responses containing Set-Cookie2 response headers unless they know for certain (by out of band means) that there are no upstream HTTP/1.0 proxies.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 servers may send other Cache-  </s>
<s> Actually, that is downstream.  </s>
<s> It is better to call it "proxies in the response chain".  </s>
<s> 6. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS Here we speculate on likely or desirable details for an origin server that implements state management.  </s>
<s> Kinda weak statement.  </s>
<s> My inclination is to delete things that don't say anything useful.  </s>
<s> 6.1 Set-Cookie2 Content An origin server's content should probably be divided into disjoint application areas, some of which require the use of state information.  </s>
<s> The application areas can be distinguished by their request URLs.  </s>
<s> The Set-Cookie2 header can incorporate information about the application areas by setting the Path attribute for each one.  </s>
<s> The session information can obviously be clear or encoded text that describes state.  </s>
<s> However, if it grows too large, it can become unwieldy.  </s>
<s> Therefore, an implementor might choose for the session information to be a key to a server-side resource.  </s>
<s> Of course, using a database creates some problems that this state management specification was meant to avoid, namely: 1. keeping real state on the server side; 2. how and when to garbage-collect the database entry, in case the user agent terminates the session by, for example, exiting.  </s>
<s> Ugh! Can we just delete section 6.1?  </s>
<s> If not, then you need to be succinct in describing the scope of design decisions and their relative trade-offs.  </s>
<s> I.e., "Cookie Length", "Namespace Allocation", and "Direct vs Indirect State Identification" are all design considerations with separable trade-offs, and thus should be discussed individually (or not at all).  </s>
<s> Likewise, a discussion of when cookies should be avoided in favor of one of the other alternatives would belong in the introduction.  </s>

<s> 4. OUTLINE  </s>
<s> Yeah, I guess that's pretty silly.  </s>
<s> I'll think of a better heading.  </s>
<s> We outline here a way for an origin server to send state information to the user agent, and for the user agent to return the state information to the origin server.  </s>
<s> The goal is to have a minimal impact on HTTP and user agents.  </s>
<s> Only origin servers that need to maintain sessions would suffer any significant impact, and that impact can largely be confined to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, unless the server provides more sophisticated state management support.  </s>
<s> (See Implementation Considerations, below.)  </s>
<s> When I first wrote this section, about 20 months ago, I was trying to anticipate concerns that implementers might have about how much of a burden cookies would be to running a server.  </s>
<s> I was trying to make a point that the support was relatively localized.  </s>
<s> In "the old days", cookies got handled by CGIs, and only those CGIs that needed cookies needed to support them.  </s>
<s> Newer servers may provide built-in support ("more sophisticated...") for cookies, but that support isn't essential to their support.  </s>
<s> Your description is correct from the HTTP point of view, of course.  </s>
<s> A user agent returns a Cookie request header (see below) to the origin server if it chooses to continue a session.  </s>
<s> The origin server may ignore it or use it to determine the current state of the session.  </s>
<s> It may send back to the client a Set-Cookie2 response header with the same or different information, or it may send no Set-Cookie2 header at all.  </s>
<s> The origin server effectively ends a session by sending the client a Set-Cookie2 header with Max-Age=0.  </s>
<s> You're thinking of it from the HTTP perspective, and I'm describing it from the application perspective.  </s>
<s> That's why I was (or tried to be) careful about using the terms "request header" and "response header" to identify the HTTP role, as distinct from the application role.  </s>
<s> Perhaps. (The thought of doing ASCII art for both .txt and .ps  </s>
<s> intimidates me a bit.)  </s>
<s> Perhaps you noticed I tried to present the behavior in a component-centric way.  </s>
<s> That means the server-specific behaviors are in 4.2.1, and the user-agent-specific behaviors are in 4.3.  </s>
<s> I don't give a consolidated overview of the cookie protocol, which I think is what you would prefer.  </s>
<s> 4.2.2 Set-Cookie2 Syntax The syntax for the Set-Cookie2 response header is set-cookie = "Set-Cookie2:" cookies cookies = 1#cookie cookie = NAME "=" VALUE *(";" set-cookie-av) NAME = attr VALUE = value set-cookie-av = "Comment" "=" value | "CommentURL" "=" " http_URL " | "Discard" | "Domain" "=" value | "Max-Age" "=" value | "Path" "=" value | "Port" [ "=" " 1#portnum " ] | "Secure" | "Version" "=" 1*DIGIT portnum = 1*DIGIT  </s>
<s> Obviously the typography dictates the precedence.  </s>
<s> :-) Seriously, do you think there's anything confusing in the current format?  </s>
<s> I fear that adding ()'s will make it harder to understand, not easier.  </s>
<s> Also, traditionally, alternation is lowest precedence after '=', no?  </s>
<s> The origin server should send the following additional HTTP/1.1 response headers, depending on circumstances: * To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie2 header: Cache-control: no- cache="set-cookie2".  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> It's strange -- I've got hyphenation disabled in the (nroff/troff) source.  </s>
<s> I guess that only controls intra-word hyphenation.  </s>
<s> (I wonder if I can even persuade nroff/troff not to break around '-'.)  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 servers must send Expires: old-date (where old-date is a date long in the past) on responses containing Set-Cookie2 response headers unless they know for certain (by out of band means) that there are no upstream HTTP/1.0 proxies.  </s>

<s> 6. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS Here we speculate on likely or desirable details for an origin server that implements state management.  </s>

<s> 6.1 Set-Cookie2 Content An origin server's content should probably be divided into disjoint application areas, some of which require the use of state information.  </s>

<s> I was just trying to point out some of the design considerations.  </s>
<s> Because the various tradeoffs are obviously implementation-dependent, I didn't want to (nor did I think I should) go into them in detail.  </s>
<s> The question is whether the draft would be better off without the section, or with the admittedly meager comments that are there.  </s>
<s> I thought it was at least worthwhile to point out the issues.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> That should be done in the abstract (and it is, as I recall).  </s>
<s> I think the draft should contain exactly what the final RFC will contain, aside from the Status section and Header/Footer.  </s>
<s> I don't know what to suggest.  </s>
<s> What happens when a cookie includes an IPv6 address (or is that even possible)?  </s>
<s> Terms, yes -- algorithms, no.  </s>
<s> The hostname dot comparison doesn't make any sense without the context for why the hostname dot comparison exists.  </s>
<s> I should have also mentioned that I was reading it from that view.  </s>
<s> I like implementation advice, but it needs to be clear what the protocol requirements are as opposed to how one might use them.  </s>
<s> A proposed standard needs to define the interface and avoid defining the application.  </s>
<s> It is in the EBNF defined by the drums WG.  </s>
<s> I tried to avoid such implied things in the HTTP specs, though I note that a few are in RFC 2068.  </s>
<s> So, I suppose you are correct.  </s>
<s> I'm just one of those programmers who likes to put parentheses around conditions, I guess.  </s>
<s> The origin server should send the following additional HTTP/1.1 response headers, depending on circumstances: * To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie2 header: Cache-control: no- cache="set-cookie2".  </s>
<s> Nope, from very painful man-page-writing experience.  </s>
<s> I suggest line breaks.  </s>

<s> Okay.  </s>
<s> I suspect no one sends IPv6 addresses in cookies now, and probably no user agents would know what to do with them.  </s>
<s> But I thought the spec.  </s>
<s> should allow them.  </s>
<s> Last I looked (some time ago), the proposed text representation of IPv6 addresses involved ':' separators, and I think they will pose problems for the URL syntax.  </s>
<s> But that syntax shouldn't pose a problem in the context of the cookie spec.  </s>
<s> I think you and I will have to disagree here.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to define a term, "domain match", and it can't be done without describing the algorithm.  </s>
<s> And I do give a sense of context: "[s]ometimes we compare one host name with another."  </s>
<s> I've looked over section 4.2.1 particularly, but I'm not sure how you would want me to recast it.  </s>
<s> I don't believe I'm defining the application, although I'm certainly describing the things an application can/should/must do.  </s>
<s> I prefer the application-centric approach; too often I see specs.  </s>
<s> that describe all the things a protocol can do, but I haven't a clue which ones I need to use.  </s>
