Not quite What I said was that I didn't know if it was possible to create a number. 
Live captioning is delayed for a number of reasons -- including allowing people to read and correct the captions before transmission. 
That delay is unavoidable today. 
Yet that delay would be unacceptable in a captioned movie. 
Also, when doing training, you want the captions to lead any important visual event. 
That is, you don?t want the person reading the caption when they should be looking at the screen to see something critical. 
So having a time gap criterion may yield either an impossible goal or a goal that is way too loose for general use. 
Larry Goldberg or Geoff Freed would have the answer though. 
Perhaps there is a standard for Pre-captioned and another for Live-captioned. 
I would suspect though that these should be recommendations or targets (and should be in techniques) rather than sufficiency criteria which are normative. 
Geoff? 
Larry?

Why do captioned objects need to be the same length as uncaptioned objects? 
Why wouldn't it be possible (and even desirable) to allow captioned versions to pause the audiovisual long enough for caption readers to catch up? 
Just wondering.

It would be entirely possible to say nothing on the point in the guidelines and leave it to techniques, or to say that the media equivalents (namely captions and auditory descriptions) must be reasonably synchronized with the non-text content, then leave it to the techniques to explain what is reasonable under various circumstances. 
On the other hand if there are clear requirements for synchronization that can be readily formulated and are of general application, then they could readily be included in the guidelines themselves. 
Yep - and that is done. 
Places it doesn?t work are 1) live presentations 2) group presentations 3) presentations followed by other presentations in a timed window. 
(e.g. a show which is followed by another show or presentation where this presentation must fit into a time slot.

would a are Chas, there are many use cases where the captions aren't the same length as the content, or where it is desirable to pause the rest of the presentation - this is also the case in audio-described content, where it takes extra time to put in the audio descriptions. 
SMIL 2 was designed to handle these cases better in various ways. 
For example, it is possible to have audio descriptions (for example) which, if they are played, force the presentation to wait at key points (this is related to the way that it controls synchronisation failure, but also to some more purpose-designed functions it introduces). 
Of course there are other cases where this is not desirable. 
Enabling a user to choose between slowing the overall presentation, and keeping it running in real time, is a nice choice to have when people are getting a live transmission. 
The technology exists (not just in SMIL, but also with conventional TV) for making this choice at multiple points, and going from one mode to the other by various means (fast-forward through buffered content, or just jump to current real-time point, or ...) cheers Charles McCN Why do captioned objects need to be the same length as uncaptioned objects?
