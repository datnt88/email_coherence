Hi! Iam Hari. 
The DOM specs says that DOMString is a sequence of 16-bit units. 
Does this mean that this string should be a unicode string. 
Or will it be acceptable if I implement DOMString with simple short integers.

Yes. 
Exactly how to represent Unicode strings will depend on the programming language you use, and you should definitely try to do the same as other implementors in the same language. 
If you can tell us what language you are using giving more information becomes much easier at once.

The DOMString datatype is intended to represent a string expressed in UTF-16. 
How that's stored internally is up to the individual DOM implementation. 
Usually, if you have a native Unicode or UTF-16 string datatype available, that will be the right choice since it'll be easiest for your customers to work with. 
If you don't, you may want to create one.
