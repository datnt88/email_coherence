Several methods in DOM2 interfaces, e.g. Element.getAttributeNS, has a 
namespaceURI. 
If the element or attribute one want to fetch has no namespace, should the namespaceURI parameter be null or the empty string? 
As I can see, the current CR is vauge. 
In Java there is a clear difference between null and the empty string.

In the Namespace spec, there is no difference between the empty string and 
no namespace. 
("The default namespace can be set to the empty string. 
This has the same effect, within the scope of the declaration, of there being no default namespace. 
") In the DOM, we say the Node.namespaceURI field is "null if it is unspecified." 
As far as I can tell we don't, but probably should, say that specifying "" is equivalent to specifying null. 
Anyone disagree?

I disagree. 
I think the DOM spec explicitly rejects an empty string as being equivalent to no namespace. 
Setting a namespace attribute is not the same as setting/getting a namespace URI on a node. 
Either way, I think it's important that the DOM2 spec makes it clear and explicit whether null or the empty string should be used, or if both are (must be) accepted. 
It's not very important which one is choosen, but I would prefer to use the empty string as no namespace and explicitly disallow null. 
That would be consistent with SAX2.

After a few emails, we clarified the spec as following: Note that although the XML specification defines that using the empty string for a namespace URI is equivalent to unsetting the namespace, because the DOM does no lexical checking, the empty string will be treated as a real namespace URI in DOM Level 2 methods. 
Applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

I can't find this clarification in the new DOM2 PR. 
DOM Level 2 doesn't perform any URI normalization or canonicalization. 
The URIs given to the DOM are assumed to be valid (e.g., characters such as whitespaces are properly escaped), and no lexical checking is performed. 
Absolute URI references are treated as strings and compared literally. 
How relative namespace URI references are treated is undefined. 
To ensure interoperability only absolute namespace URI references (i.e., URI references beginning with a scheme name and a colon) should be used. 
Note that because the DOM does no lexical checking, the empty string will be treated as a real namespace URI in DOM Level 2 methods. 
Applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no namespace.
