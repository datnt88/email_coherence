<s> Joy, Most users prefer to know what the link is doing or where the link is going.  </s>
<s> Having a link that describes the image doesn't help them in terms of understanding what is going to happen when the link is activated.  </s>
<s> Window-Eyes users can read the status line to get the URL while the link/image is focused (assuming JavaScript isn't changing the status line), so that's a work-around.  </s>
<s> But the ALT tag should describe the action.  </s>

<s> I believe that the important information to convey is the function of the link.  </s>
<s> Whatever Adobe's logo happens to be in this case isn't nearly as important as what the link will accomplish for me if I follow it.  </s>
<s> I don't know that it is a hard and fast rule but more often than not I've found that emphasizing the function of the image as opposed to a full description for alt text is what works best.  </s>
<s> Jamie, I double-checked, and our license agreement doesn't contain any mention of alt tags.  </s>
<s> Authors should attach whatever Alt tag is most effective, and I certainly agree with the advice that has been given on this list.  </s>
