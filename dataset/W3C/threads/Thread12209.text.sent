I think the following techniques also apply to conversion tools: Guideline 1: all of them. 
Guideline 2: checkpoint 2.1 techniques T0082, T0085 checkpoint 2.2 all techniques checkpoint 2.3 technique T0089 Guideline 3: checkpoint 3.1 all techniques checkpoint 3.2 techniques T0119, T0126, T0127, T0128, T0131 to T0136, T0139 to T0142 checkpoint 3.3 all techniques checkpoint 3.4 T0178, T0179 checkpoint 3.5 T0180, T0182, T0183 More to follow Chaals Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I think I saw a reference in the techniques doc to 'wombat' - is that right and should it be there in that form? 
The doc overall is very helpful but I found what seemed like a few bugs - at is this the version I should be looking at? the following appears in the bit about prompting: Prompts: Prompts are interface mechanisms that request information from the user, or at least provide an opportunity for user to provide information if they wish.... 
I think it should be: Prompts: Prompts are interface mechanisms that request information from the user, or at least provide an opportunity for ***THE*** user to provide information if they wish. 
On most GUI platforms, prompts commonly take the form of dialog box controls. 
and a little bit later: if the user presses activates the "Save" should be if the user activates the "Save" ??? and (ex. 
saving to a should be (e.g. saving to a ???? (is ex. a US way of doing this???) and (i.e. "There are a few spellling mistakes") is this deliberate or should it be (i.e. "There are a few spelling mistakes") ??? and the alert should include two or more options that linking to a prompt should be the alert should include two or more options that link to a prompt - I think??? overall, I think that non-intrusive would be better than unintrusive???? 
Well, I don't think there ias a reference to Wombat in the techniques. 
But if so, please let me know - it shouldn't be tehre in the current drafts (althouh there is a work item to identify which techniques apply to which wombat checkpoints - especially in the case of checkpoints that have been changes for wombat) cheers Charles I think I saw a reference in the techniques doc to 'wombat' - is that right and should it be there in that form?

You should really be looking at the current version, nov 24 - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124/appa but there have been no changes in the content between the two drafts I don't think. 
Since these are all editorial changes I will simply make them, unless there are any objections.
