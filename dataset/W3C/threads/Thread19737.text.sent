Thank you very much, I downloaded tar.zip and ran 'tar -xf' on the file previously 'gzip -d' and it built a directory structure of sorts. 
Now for the next questions. 
(I need to take this one step at a time in order to understand what is going on). 
During the tar process there were a myriad of 'cannot create' errors. 
The resulting amaya directory has the following .h 
files: AHTERROR.H HTMLSTYLE.H AMAYA.H AMAYAMSG.H CSS.H JAVAAMAY.H LIBWWW.H LIBJAVA.H TRANS.H and the following .c 
files AHTBRIDG.C AHTFWRIT.C AHTMEMCO.C AHTTOURL.C EDITORAC.C EDITIMAG.C EDITSTYL.C HTMLACTI.C HTMLBOOK.C HTMLEDIT.C HTMLFORM.C HTMLLIST.C HTMLIMAG.C HTMLPRES.C HTMLSAVE.C HTMLSTYL.C HTMLTABL.C MATHEDIT.C UICSS.C ANSWER.C CSS.C JAVAAMAY.C HTML2THO.C INIT.C P2CSS.C QUERY.C TRANS.C TRANSPAR.C 1. 
Is this all of the .h and .c 
files for amaya? 
2. If there were any long file names they were lost in the tar process, is there a different procedure that would conserve them. 
3. In compiling, should there be a particular directory created for the source or is it sufficient that all these .c, 
.h 
be in the same directory.

(list deleted) Again, you should consider getting WinZip from Niko Mak at www.winzip.com. 
It understands tar and gzip formats as well as PKZIP and preserves long filenames and directories correctly.
