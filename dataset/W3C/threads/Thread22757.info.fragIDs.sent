Yes, but you will need to define the  operator or a comparator class. 
This is off topic for this mailing list so mail me personally if you need more information.

Template classes operate off of any datatype, so yes, it is absolutely possible to use STL functions such as vectors, hashtables, etc. with DOM_Node objects. 
However, you would be better off using the provided classes that come with your DOM implementation (i.e. NodeList and NamedNodeMap) instead.
