Dear w3c-translators, I'm interested on translate the RDF Model and Syntax Specification. 
W3C Recommendation 22 February 1999 as well as Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schema Specification 1.0, as soon as it was Recommendation. 
From now, I think I can finished the translation of Model and Syntax Specification for the end of November, and I accept all the clauses explained on http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#translate 
Could someone tell me what are the next steps?
