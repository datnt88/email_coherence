<s> I'm not an expert in Xerces but you should be allowed to get a DOMImplementation object (see org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation()) Using this object, you can use the createDocument method to create a DOM Document: Note: - Since DOM Level 2 is not a recommendation yet, the implementation of DOM Level 2 in Xerces is still in beta stage.  </s>
<s> - DOMImplementationImpl is not an official DOM method.  </s>
<s> The bootstrapping problem in Java will be resolved in DOM Level 3. Philippe  </s>
<s> It is possible... here is an example.  </s>
