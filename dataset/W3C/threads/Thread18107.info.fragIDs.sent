<s> Hello Group: One important review function that we've forgotten in section 10.8 is the function to read the current element.  </s>

<s> Mickey, I think there are two parts to an answer to this request: 1) We are relying on assistive technologies to do the rendering of selected content outside of the context of other content.  </s>
<s> 2) We have requirements to be able to navigate to some elements in the document (active elements, important elements).  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think your requirement is met by (a) requiring that the user be able to navigate to an element.  </s>
<s> (b) requiring availability of content through the DOM so that ATs may render selected or focused content.  </s>
<s> Just a reminder that all content must be available through both the user interface and the DOM, but there is no requirement that selected content be rendered em out of context /em in the conforming user agent's user interface.  </s>
<s> I therefore don't believe that any other requirement is necessary for the document.  </s>
