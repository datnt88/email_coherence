Hi! I just downloaded the solaris 2.5 binary of amaya, and started playing with it. 
Within a couple of minutes, it died with the message: *** Thot: Irrecoverable error *** I was typing into a table cell at the time. the same fatal error re-occurred after restarting amaya. 
Is this a known bug? 
Could it be due to my machine being a solaris 2.5.1 machine, rather than 2.5? 
If so, will compiling from source fix the problem? 
What little I've been able to see of amaya looks nice. 
I'd like to be able to get farther however. 
Any suggestions on how to prevent amaya from dying would be appreciated... thanks, Michael Bloom mike4bm@1stnetusa.com 
Hi, I guess it's a bug. 
We're just preparing a new release by the end of April. 
So, could you send us the URL, the piece of HTML or a scenario to reproduce the bug?

May we take this opportunity to request that the possibility of using "middle-button" instead of/as well as "double-click" should be included in this release, for the benefit of those of us who suffer from the "double-click" problem? 
With thenaks, Ted.

We're thinking about a solution for the "double-click" problem, but we're not sure to be ready in time.
