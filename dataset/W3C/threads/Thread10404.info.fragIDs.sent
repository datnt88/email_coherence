<s> I'm just looking at recent changes to the semantics document, and wish to (a) check my understanding, and (b) suggest a possible clarification for the errata and next round.  </s>
<s> I refer to rule 'lg' in the document at: at 15-Dec-2003, self-described as: RDF Semantics W3C Working Draft @@ November 2003 This Version: In section 7.1 (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#simpleRules there is a new rule 'lg', which says: [rule name] gl [if E contains] uuu aaa _:nnn .  </s>
<s> where _:nnn identifies a blank node allocated to the literal lll by rule lg. [then add] uuu aaa lll .  </s>
<s> My first reaction was that this new rule is redundant, but now I think that "[if E contains] uuu aaa _:nnn ." must refer to some property URI aaa other than that which was used by the use of rule lg to allocate _:nnn to lll.  </s>
<s> I think this intent would be clearer if a different metavariable were used  </s>
<s> in rules 'lg' and 'gl', e.g. 'gl' might read:  </s>
<s> [rule name] gl [if E contains] uuu bbb _:nnn .  </s>
<s> where _:nnn identifies a blank node allocated to the literal lll by rule lg. [then add] uuu bbb lll .  </s>
<s> Responding now as an implementer, the new rule looks like a pain to implement (which is maybe OK, but I have tried to create an implementation that can do, say, proof-checking that is based very closely on the specification).  </s>
<s> I'm thinking that I might take a slightly different approach, which I think is equivalent:  </s>
<s> Rule: lg1 If E contains: uuu aaa lll .  </s>
<s> Then: uuu aaa _:nnn.  </s>
<s> _:nnn foo:sameAs lll .  </s>
<s> (where _:nnn is allocated as described for rule 'lg'.) Rule: gl1 If E contains: uuu bbb _:nnn .  </s>
<s> _:nnn foo:sameAs lll .  </s>
<s> Then: uuu bbb lll .  </s>
<s> (The 'foo:sameAs' property is intended to appeal to the owl:sameAs property, without getting entangled with the owl semantic conditions on owl:sameAs.  </s>
<s> I.e., a foo:sameAs b does not necessarily mean that I(a) == (b), just that a p c .  </s>
<s> = b p c .  </s>
<s> and d q a .  </s>
<s> = d q b .  </s>
<s> for all syntactically allowable c, d, p, q.)  </s>

<s> Yeh, it would be nice to get the idea across more clearly.  </s>
<s> To do so would have needed a bigger rewrite that would have been acceptable as editorial, at this stage.  </s>
<s> It happens as follows: p range class a p "foo" ;; now the literal "foo" has to be a class ;; _:x subclass "foo" ;;because, being a class, "foo" is a subclass of itself ;; Rule lg generates the _:x allocated to "foo" and then the RDFS rules will get you to _:x subclass _:x but then without something else, you are stuck.  </s>
<s> This ONLY happens in this case (and the similar one using property/subproperty) because the only rules that move a subject to object position are the reflexiveness rules on subclass and subproperty, so this is the only way you can get stuck in this corner.  </s>
<s> So you only need to use rule gl after applying rule rdfs6 or 10, in fact.  </s>
<s> Right, exactly.  </s>
<s> That is what is needed in an implementation: to treat the literal and its allocated bnode *in exactly the same way* wherever syntactically possible.  </s>
<s> In fact, the best way to handle this would be to actually use the literal in subject position when applying the rules, if your implementation can handle that, and just ignore rules lg and gl.  </s>
<s> Or, maybe, apply rule lg to everything, *including the proposed conclusion* which would be closest to standard computational-logic practice and would obviously avoid the need for that silly rule gl; in effect it would just eliminate  </s>
<s> literals altogether in favor of blank nodes.  </s>
<s> You can get a clearer insight into the role of these rules by checking how they are used in the construction of the 'closures' in the appendix proofs.  </s>

<s> I could use the literal-as-subject approach, but I wanted (for no particular reason other than a sense of tidiness) to be able to check proofs that were based as closely as I could manage on the RDF formal spec.  </s>
