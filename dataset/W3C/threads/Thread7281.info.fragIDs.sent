<s> A DMS must have a lock that is persistent over time.  </s>
<s> The concept of a non-persistent lock is only valid during an on-line editing session (as opposed to a checked-out document).  </s>
<s> If we do specify lock time-out as a property of locking we must also define what the behavior of the lock will be if the document repository does not support a lock time-out feature.  </s>

<s> Steve: While some DMS systems out there are designed around file locking, it is possible to have a fully functional remote DMS that does not use remote file locking.  </s>
<s> The Sun Teamware product is one such DMS.  </s>
<s> While Teamware is layered on top of SCCS (which has local file locking), the distributed authoring component of Teamware does not use remote file locks.  </s>
<s> Thus, the statement that "A DMS must have a lock that is persitent over time." should probably be restated to say "Some DMS's need persistent locks."  </s>
<s> Given the difficulty of managing remote locks, it may be appropriate to investigate a dist.  </s>

<s> File locking assumes that the DMS is using the file system as the underlying document storage system.  </s>
<s> Upscale DMSs will use some kind of database facility that will provide lock services is a different way, not via a file locking mechanism.  </s>
<s> The DMS sported by GroupWise 5 does not use any native file system but does provide for a persistent lock (plus much, much more).  </s>
<s> Anyway, I don't dispute that my statement could be better stated that "Some .  </s>

<s> If the DMS (or better stated, the document repository) supports a lock then it will provide the appropriate functionality, if not then an error message will be returned.  </s>
