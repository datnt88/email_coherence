I get exactly the same response. 
I've done what you indicate, to download the directories separately, which works fine. 
Sysgroup, please advise on status of the empty directory in the 2001/DOM-Test-Suite directory which seems to cause trouble.

Something strange in the CVS [Probably need CVS admin help] Was about half way through a commit, when something snapped. 
It seems to be something broken with the CVS client for Windows that just kills any interaction with the repository either as a known user or anonymous. 
The repository looks fine from cvsweb and from Linux, but I get this message (which I think Mary was getting earlier in the week) even from a machine that I just put cvs on. 
Trying to check out 2001/XSL-Test-Suite seems to work just fine.

You can actually commit changes as long as your working directory is deeper that DOM-Test-Suite. 
Looking at that level in CVS web ( http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/ ) there is a mysterious entry for a / (unnamed)directory. 
Don't know how that got there, but could see how it could confuse a CVS client. 
The checkout on Linux also had an unnamed directory. 
Mary and Dimitris, see if these tricks allow you to access with CVS. 
Phillipe, could you have someone kill that unnamed directory (if that is the right thing to do.) Me too -- I can access the directories individually, but not from the top level. 
Finally, it seems that others are having similar issues -- it's not just me!
