I have been bogged down in things a bit here so am trying to get on top of things again. 
We are going to support a DeltaV friendly versioning model etc, but were debating whether it was worth our effort at this 
stage supporting the DeltaV protocol. 
We were unsure of what clients existed that we could (1) try locally to test things (2) tell customers that they could purchase. 
We are developing a server product, not standalone client applications. 
We do not want to develop a DeltaV client (and do not need to for what we are doing). 
We are making things compatible for the future when clients are available, but I cannot see (at this stage) there is much benefit to *us* implementing the DeltaV protocol at this stage. 
Are there clients around now I could get a copy of to try things out internally/recommend to customers? 
If not know, any rough indications of timelines when the would be available? 
Thanks, Alan 
I believe the main benefit of early support for the DeltaV protocol is that you can provide WebDAV access (and therefore all of the current WebDAV clients such as Word 2000 and the Windows Explorer can run against your server), and that a simple "DeltaV helper" client can let you do explicit checkout/checkin if it is needed. 
As more clients support the DeltaV operations, the DeltaV helper client can eventually be phased out.

There is also the Subversion client -- Subversion uses the DeltaV protocol, and provides both client and server pieces.
