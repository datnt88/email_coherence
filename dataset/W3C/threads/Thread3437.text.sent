Brant Langer Gurganus The list is operationnal, not very active right now, but we should have news soon. 
Molly and the W3C are working together to produce something for the audience of this list. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- I'm sure tomg's keeping his eyes peeled.
