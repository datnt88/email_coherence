<s> Strangely the winner in the games category http://www.orisinal.com  </s>
<s> has an interface rather similar to peepo.co.uk, even to the extent that the page is 'greyed' out and the links gain saturation onmouseover, however they chose flash rather than SVG.  </s>
<s> any plans for an accessibility or usability webby?  </s>

<s> orisinal.com was around before SVG was invented (and I have to say that as much as I normally hate flash I'm a big fan of orisinal).  </s>
<s> Jon, I also like orisinal, surely no surprise there.  </s>
<s> It would however be much easier to repurpose the interface and games, if they were in SVG.  </s>
<s> perhaps arguably more accessible too.  </s>
<s> Is there any benefit to orisinal being in flash?  </s>
<s> you seem to suggest there might be.  </s>

<s> Not really, although at the time the site began Flash had an obvious advantage over SVG in that it existed, and SVG didn't!  </s>
<s> Whether SVG would be just as good could only be determined by porting the games and seeing.  </s>
<s> Given that the games were designed to take advantage of Flash's strong points I would be surprised if they would all be as playable - especially since the viewers are relatively recent and still at a stage where each new version has considerably better performance than the previous.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that porting to SVG would automatically bring an improvement in accessibility.  </s>
<s> In particular given that the point of most of the games is to be visually attractive tests of hand-eye co-ordination it's hard to imagine them being used by anyone other than users of graphical browsers with good eyesight and good motor skills.  </s>
