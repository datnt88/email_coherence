Hi, RFC 2616 defines a http proxy and a tunnel. 
But I'am confused on how a http tunnel works. 
A proxy works by taking a request from a client and connecting to the origin server indicated in the request. 
Here the client is configured to go through the proxy. 
How does a http tunnel work. 
Is the initial connection similar ? 
Does a client (browser) need to configured differently when it goes through a tunnel or is it same as the configuration required when it goes through the proxy ? 
Are there to separate tcp connections for each request even in a tunnel ? 
Thanks in Advance, Regards, Vinit Kumar

Actually, the client may or may not know about the proxy. 
The difference is in the behavior of the intermediate system (proxy or tunnel). 
A tunnel just forwards the request and the response unmodified. 
A proxy at least adds its own identification to a Via header, and may also respond from a cache, require proxy authentication, or any number of other proxy-specific functions.

The client always knows about the proxy -- that is what distinguishes a proxy from a gateway. 
A "reverse proxy" is a gateway. 
Some tunnels are activated by a proxy request, some are simply port forwarding TCP firewalls (either on the client side or the server side, or both), and others are gateways to other servers. 
The important thing from HTTP's perspective is that once an 
intermediary becomes a tunnel, it is no longer conscious of the 
HTTP communication -- only of bytes being relayed from one connection to another.

Actually, for better or worse, the client does not always know about the proxy. 
Transparent proxies are quite common. 
Again, for better or worse, mostly worse IMHO :) 
Those are not transparent proxies -- they are firewall gateways, even when they occur near to the client. 
My use of "proxy" and "gateway" are defined in the HTTP spec, which does not always correspond to what some marketing departments call their products.

For tunnels that are activated by a proxy request, A browser has to be configured to go through the proxy.So a request from a browser to a HTTP Proxy or a HTTP tunnel(activated by a request) is one and the same. 
What I 
mean is that, even if the intermediary is a HTTP tunnel, the client always talks to the tunnel thru one part of the connection and a tunnel will forward that on another connection to the ORIGIN SERVER. 
Even the origin servers response will come to the intermediate tunnel which get forwarded to the client on the other connection. 
These requests or the responses MAY contain some hop-by-hop header information such as Keep-Alive, Connection Header (close), Max-Forwards etc.. While a proxy can take care of them ,what will a should a HTTP tunnel do? 
A http tunnel would'nt even look at the response or at the request(apart from looking at the URL to see where the forwarding connection should be established). 
How does a HTTP tunnel take care of persistant connections and request pipelining?

No, they aren't. 
The terms "client", "server", "proxy", "tunnel", etc., are all regarding the ROLE of the software for a particular request/response. 
The first request went to a proxy -- after the 200 response, it is no longer a proxy. 
It is not an HTTP tunnel -- it is just a tunnel, period. 
RFC 2616: tunnel An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between two connections. 
Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been initiated by an HTTP request. 
The tunnel ceases to exist when both ends of the relayed connections are closed. 
By definition, it does not grok HTTP, therefore it doesn't take care of persistant connections and request pipelining.
