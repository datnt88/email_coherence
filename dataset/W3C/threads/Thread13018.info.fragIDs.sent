<s> Sorry about this grin .  </s>
<s> Many of us believe that server-side scripting makes dynamic or interactive pages more accessible than pages using corresponding client-side techniques.  </s>
<s> Oft-heard excuses for the "requirement" for client-side processing - e.g. for form validation, dynamic layout and content, etc. - instead of server-side processing are that "our server can't handle the transaction load" or that "the response time for clients would be unreasonable".  </s>
<s> Since it is sometimes difficult to create the equivalent functionality of client-side features in non-scripted HTML I suggest the following "solution":  </s>
<s> Why not design the scripted functionality with client-side techniques that  </s>

<s> user agents do support and who can access client-side services).  </s>
<s> Then, instead of making the accessible "fall-back" a non-scripted alternative, make it a call to an equivalent server-side script.  </s>
<s> This means that the  </s>
<s> majority of users will process the service locally - putting no further strain on the server - and only the relative few who won't or can't support scripting will cause a further transaction on the server.  </s>
<s> I don't have any statistics handy, but for sake of argument I'll guess that 5% of the browsing public can't or won't support client-side scripting.  </s>
<s> If a page gets 100000 hits per day, 95000 would be processed on client-side and only 5000 would issue another hit on the server.  </s>
<s> I would be surprised that anyone expecting a high transaction volume would not have at least 5% extra capacity on their server.  </s>
<s> For the end-user who needs the server-side version there might be some slight reduction in transaction speed but I suspect that the slight speed drop would be mitigated by the fact that the functionality is available at all.  </s>
<s> Turned the other way, the organization benefits from making the page or service accessible to users of more types of user agents.  </s>

<s> Hi Chuck, all, First, another argument for those that complain about server load when using server-side scripting: client-side scripting also requires to serve bigger pages, because you must send a few Kbs of JavaScript to the client (and I have seen pages with more than a few Kbs, but close to 50kbs of extra JavaScript code due to complex validation form techniques).  </s>
<s> As already said, browser sniffing will not work, because you are not able to determine from the HTTP request whether the user has JavaScript activated.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the only "reasonable" technique, also from an accessibility standpoint, is server-side scripting.  </s>
<s> If you are receiving 100,000 requests a day, you better have a good server with load balancing, otherwise you are in big trouble.  </s>
<s> In regard to the solution that Judy wants to implement for the document we were discussing, the solution we use is X(HT)ML+XSLT (Apache + Cocoon).  </s>

<s> The basic idea is "yes, there should be some diversity in where things get done, and it is necessary to get this instilled in the DI principles to make it W3C dogma, because it is generic DI stuff and not peculiar to disability access.  </s>
<s> In particular, In that post I briefly mention a scenario dealing with "how PWDs oughta be able to use the Web of Web Services soon."  </s>
<s> This one revolves around the Mike May GPS-enabled BrailleNote personal digital assistant.  </s>
<s> The scenario is that the BrailleNote uses its GPS accessory to know where the user is in the city and they use the built in browser and radio internet access to access a commodity restaurant guide site.  </s>
<s> First off, there is a machine shortcut by which "here" becomes something out of the GPS service that the user can inject into the query against the restaurant guide where it asks "near where?"  </s>
<s> [This can be done if the restaurant site uses XForms, so that there is a defined (and accessible?) model of the user-input fields by which it asks about map locations.]  </s>
<s> Secondly, the route-planning function in the BrailleNote knows through user customization that it cares about sidewalk closings and bad intersections with short lights or inadequate crosswalk marking.  </s>
<s> The restaurant guide doesn't understand this level of stuff and doesn't need to.  </s>
<s> It just includes a street address, and the GPS route-planner goes from there.  </s>
<s> There is an interoperation standard for plugins that means the GPS route-planner as shipped didn't know about the DPW (that's Department of Public Works for international readers) sidewalk-closing service, but the user can install knowledge which tells the route planner how to access the DPW service.  </s>
<s> This may all be discoverable.  </s>
<s> The user on web-browsing to the DPW site could be able to pick up WSDL for the sidewalk-closings service and the browser knows how to disclose this to the pedestrian-route-planning GPS plugin service and we are off on a route that avoids the construction horses across the sidewalk.  </s>
<s> This is client-side combination of information from un-cooperating servers, for which we need access to metadata from each un-cooperating server to build the metdata bridge so we can join the information from the several formats used by the several servers.  </s>
<s> This is the radical step.  </s>
<s> It doesn't require RDF.  </s>
<s> RDF can be instrumental in making it easy.  </s>
<s> It requires that all the sites accept an "only document" level of metadata standard.  </s>
<s> Then third-party WebServices can do the connecting from there to make composite data [see Grossman] available as a resource to client-hosted methods.  </s>
