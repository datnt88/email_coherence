<s> with the proxy server...  </s>
<s> We were running a number of tests using Netscape, MSIE V5, Opera, Neoplanet  </s>
<s> browsers.  </s>
<s> We knew that the proxy server was dowgrading the response.  </s>
<s> Based on the references provided by Jeff and other document Q222064 ("Pragma: no-cache" Tag May Not Prevent Pages from Being Cached) and Q234067 (Prevent Caching in Internet Explorer) (from MS Support) explain why the web page was  </s>
<s> still being cached by the browser.  </s>
<s> The strange thing was the pages were not being cached by Netscape - even with HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> A problem still exists at the browser end however.  </s>
<s> From a security end we know that HTTP/1.0 has flaws (especially when you  </s>
<s> introduce a web browser), but it raises the question of how many proxy  </s>
<s> server are there which only implement HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> All it seems to takes is a  </s>
<s> single proxy server for a response to be downgraded, and for the browser to  </s>
<s> receive that downgraded response and (correctly?) ignore any settings that  </s>
<s> are not associated with the protocol identifier in the response - such as  </s>
<s> Cache-Control headers.  </s>
<s> Regards, Tim C.  </s>
<s> to  </s>
<s> Incorrectly.  </s>
<s> If a browser supports the Cache-Control header field for any HTTP/1.x response, then it should support it for every HTTP/1.x  </s>
<s> response.  </s>
<s> The definition of an HTTP header field is defined by the major number, not the minor number.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> For MSIE there is reason to believe that the browser will cache documents with: "Cache-Control: no-cache", since MSIE's feature "Work Offline".  </s>
<s> Maybe that "must-revalidate" is never cached by the browser, since commercial banners usually asked to be retreived from the server when working offline.  </s>
<s> It is possible that objects are not retreived from cache when working offline is disabled.  </s>
<s> To validate this, you should search of ask Microsoft.  </s>
<s> And indeed Roy seems to be right.  </s>
<s> A HTTP/1.1 proxy/server should not serve requests for HTTP/2.0 or later clients, but may do it for a HTTP/1.9 or HTTP/1.10 request according to the HTTP/1.1 RFC.  </s>
<s> This is outlined in the RFC.  </s>
<s> This is one failure of the MS-IIS, that serves HTTP/2.0 or later requests, even though it is only a HTTP/1.1 server.  </s>
<s> Netscape doesn't do this... Protocol changes that are not compatible with HTTP/1.x should be HTTP/2.0 and not HTTP/1.2 (or any)... - Joris  </s>
