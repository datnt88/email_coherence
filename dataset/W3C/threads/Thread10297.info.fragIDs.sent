I believe we agreed on if semantics for subPropertyOf Does the following test case capture the lack of "only if" eg:p rdfs:range xsd:integer . 
eg:p rdfs:range xsd:string . 
eg:q rdf:type rdf:Property . 
does not entail (even with knowledge of xsd:integer and xsd:string) 
eg:p rdfs:subPropertyOf eg:q . 
(but does in OWL Full).

OK 
pf.. the extension of p is the empty set which is indeed a subset of any set (will not immediately add such rules ;-)) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Do I understand?... eq:p has empty range, hence has empty IEXT, and is therefore a subproperty (not necessarily proper) of any other property if subproperty is treated as extensional? 
If so, it looks OK to me.
