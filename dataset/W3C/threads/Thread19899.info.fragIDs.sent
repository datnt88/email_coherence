<s> We very much want to use your well-thought-out GUI in Amaya and in trying to do so we ran into a problem.  </s>
<s> To illustrate the problem, we have put a simple little script at physnet.pa.msu.edu/two-forms.html .  </s>
<s> Netscape handles it OK, giving updated times even if the same button is pressed twice in succession.  </s>
<s> Amaya updates the time only when the buttons are pressed alternately.  </s>
<s> In addition, the button value is missing in Amaya's forms submission.  </s>
<s> These are handled OK by Navigator.  </s>
<s> Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!  </s>

<s> Amaya is mainly an authoring tool and not a browser.  </s>
<s> It supports only browser functionalities needed to author Web page.  </s>
<s> For that reason, there is no support for JavaScript, animated gifs and other dynamic things except form activations.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Is this the attitude that is going to be taken in the future?  </s>
<s> I think it is very important that the W3C has a fully functional browser - this could be used as a testbed for new technologies as well as an example of a conforming implementation of existing ones.  </s>
<s> Why should Amaya not be that browser?  </s>
<s> I understand that the core Amaya team was put together to work to produce an authoring tool, and that they may well wish to continue along that road.  </s>
<s> I have no intention of dismantling or obstructing that work.  </s>
<s> However, I see no reason that Amaya cannot be a good browser *as well*.  </s>
<s> The intention to make public the Amaya CVS tree has been announced.  </s>
<s> I saw that as an opportunity for work to be done in areas that were not in the brief, or not of interest to, those currently working on Amaya.  </s>
<s> This would allow development of the editor features to continue at full pace whilst work was done elsewhere on Amaya.  </s>
<s> I was intending to work on browser features of Amaya.  </s>
<s> However, if that is going to be against the wishes of the core development team, obviously that is going to be impossible.  </s>
