On 16 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question. 
A straw poll indicates the question needs further discussion in the work group. 
B.13 Should XML remove SGML's prohibition on ENTITY attributes for notations (11.4.1)? 
This would make XML incompatible with SGML systems. 
We need a consistent view on whether or not we are seeking to achieve compatibility.

GL3 2PU, UK It's funny -- I came across this yesterday, as SoftQuad Panorama actually uses ENTITY notation attributes in its style sheet DTD (oops). 
They're used to specify a mask for an icon. 
I don't understand the restriction in SGML (maybe someone can explain it?) but I don't see how it can sensibly be lifted in XML unless it might also be lifted in SGML. Lee When we stumbled upon this silly restriction, I asked Charles about it, and he wrote me as follows: The restrictions on data attribute declared values is on the list to be examined during the revision of SGML. 
I introduced data attributes late in the game so I did it conservatively (I was concerned about long chains of entities that had data attributes among which were entities that had data attributes, etc.) Soooo, we have kept the entity attribute in the style sheet DTD--which is proprietary anyway--and look forward to the day when, hopefully, entity attributes for notations are allowed in both SGML and XML.
