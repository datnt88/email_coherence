<s> The obvious answer is the list at http://www.w3.org/TR - which even classifies them according to whether they are Recommendations, Working Drafts, etc.  </s>
<s> Here is some text I am writing for EuroAccessibility's evaluation  </s>

<s> Note that it is a personal opinion written this morning, and the relevant group at EuroAccessibility hasn't seen it, much less agreed with it.  </s>
<s> And that is a step before I would suggest it to the WCAG group.  </s>
<s> I think we need to provide (and maintain :-( a list of what we consider the relevant technologies.  </s>
<s> I would start with XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1, CSS 1.0 (anticipating a move to 2.1 as soon as it is published as a Recommendation), MathML 2.0, PNG, SMIL 2.0, XML signature / encryption / decryption, XML Schema, XSLT, XSL, VoiceXML 2.0, P3P, ATAG 1.0 (where an application has an authoring component), UAAG 1.0 (where content provides an interface to reading other content, such as foafnaut does) PICS and RDF.  </s>
<s> In addition we should suggest SVG, EARL, SOAP 1.2, and keep an eye on the implementation status so we upgrade them as appropriate.  </s>

<s> I'd be interested in hearing your reasons for not including HTML4.01 (or even earlier) and DOM.  </s>
