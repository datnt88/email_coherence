Can anyone point me to a list of "W3C technologies" as stipulated in WCAG1 checkpoint 11.1? 
thanks

The obvious answer is the list at http://www.w3.org/TR - which even classifies them according to whether they are Recommendations, Working Drafts, etc. 
Here is some text I am writing for EuroAccessibility's evaluation 
methodology task for to consider - I'll send a pointer to the archive when I have finished the message and sent it. 
Note that it is a personal opinion written this morning, and the relevant group at EuroAccessibility hasn't seen it, much less agreed with it. 
And that is a step before I would suggest it to the WCAG group. 
I think we need to provide (and maintain :-( a list of what we consider the relevant technologies. 
I would start with XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1, CSS 1.0 (anticipating a move to 2.1 as soon as it is published as a Recommendation), MathML 2.0, PNG, SMIL 2.0, XML signature / encryption / decryption, XML Schema, XSLT, XSL, VoiceXML 2.0, P3P, ATAG 1.0 (where an application has an authoring component), UAAG 1.0 (where content provides an interface to reading other content, such as foafnaut does) PICS and RDF. 
In addition we should suggest SVG, EARL, SOAP 1.2, and keep an eye on the implementation status so we upgrade them as appropriate.

Thanks Chaals sheepish look / 
I'd be interested in hearing your reasons for not including HTML4.01 (or even earlier) and DOM.
