Danbri, how are you doing on your action item on the boilerplate SOTD? 
I'd appreciate a sanity check from WG and at least one of Brian or Eric before folk start copying and pasting. 
Of course each spec needs it's own info re per-doc changes too, see the @@section for where to put that. 
The guts of the SOTD is: 
This Working Draft consolidates changes and editorial improvements undertaken in response to feedback received during the Last Call publication of the RDFCore specifications which began on 23 January 2003. 
...brief, factual and not really getting into business of where we expect to go next. 
Dan 
looks ok to me. 
I suggest that we particularly want to highlight i18n's xml lang/xml literal issue and request feedback, say in both concepts and in syntax, and in the announcement. 
Does it make sense for such highlighting to go in the status section?

Yes, at least in the documents. 
I didn't attempt this in the boilerplate I drafted since it is intended to be mixed-in with per document text. 
I think so.

Good! #g Graham Klyne GK@NineByNine.org 
This boilerplate was carried over from LC2 stod and as Danbri mentioned and was intended to be generic across documents. 
The thought was that editors would include high level big general issues highlighted with a link to the more detailed changes section. 
@@ highlighted changes the editors might want to summarize per document here @@. 
Detailed changes from the previous 23 January 2003 working draft are described in the Changes section. 
I certainly was thinking the i18n's xml lang/xml literal issue and removal of social meaning section at the time I drafted the above. 
At a high level, I agreed.

Dan, all-- 
The pubrules checker complains if the SOTD doesn't including the following boilerplate (apparently literally this text, based on my experience with the new Primer): "Publication as a Working Draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. 
This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. 
It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress.

I18N issue draft SOTD for concepts: A notable change since the Last Call publication is the simplification of typed literals to exclude language tags. 
The Working Group particularly seeks feedback on the impact of this change on the datatype rdf:XMLLiteral. 
I would suggest that the syntax SOTD should highlight that For a property element with rdf:parseType="Literal" an xml:lang attribute on it or one of its ancestors is ignored.
