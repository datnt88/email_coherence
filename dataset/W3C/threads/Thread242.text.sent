Greetings, everybody! 
I've discovered what I believe to be a bug in Tidy ver 27 Sep 1999. 
Here is a sample HTML file: Tidy generates the following output on my Indigo2 IRIX workstation: Tidy (vers 27th September 1999) Parsing "bug.html" line 10 column 23 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 10 column 28 - Warning: discarding unexpected /option line 12 column 23 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 12 column 27 - Warning: discarding unexpected /option "bug.html" appears to be HTML 2.0 4 warnings/errors were found! 
Why does it destroy the option text? 
The 26 July release did not have this problem: Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "bug.html" "bug.html" appears to be HTML 2.0 no warnings or errors were found [snip] AND OR [snip] Incidentally, anybody know why Tidy validates my sample bug.html as HTML 2.0, when all the elements are 4.0 compliant?
