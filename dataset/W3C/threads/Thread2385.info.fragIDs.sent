<s> I know many of you have expressed your opinion before, but we need to ask the question just once more: Leaving out any consideration of the privacy issues (which will be addressed once we've resolved the protocol issues), are you, in favor of proposing the mechanism in draft-ietf-http-state-man-mech-04.txt as a Proposed Standard.  </s>
<s> This is a working group LAST CALL on this issue.  </s>
<s> You may send your (preferably brief) opinion to me privately, or to the list publicly.  </s>
<s> I'll summarize private opinions.  </s>

<s> ...and that impact can largely be confined to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, unless the server provides more sophisticated state management support.  </s>
<s> That whole statement could just be cut without detracting from the spec.  </s>
<s> CGI is irrelevant - almost all server implementations provide other mechanisms for programatic access and the state management mechanisms apply to them all equally (whether they are "more sophisticated" or not).  </s>

<s> Why not just make the syntax for 'value': value = token | quoted-string  </s>
<s> I don't see any use for the 'word' token (and the name 'word' is misleading because it isn't a word in the normal english usage).  </s>
<s> NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute and the = sign.  </s>
<s> ... and between the "=" and the value?  </s>
<s> There should just be a reference to the general rule for implied whitespace in HTTP header parsing (section 2.1 in RFC2068).  </s>
