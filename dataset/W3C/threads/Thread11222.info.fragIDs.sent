<s> Apologies for any rudeness, but the point still stands.  </s>
<s> I will repeat the argument again.  </s>
<s> If you allow "importation" of elements from another "namespace", you need a way to validate that this is legal according to the DTD.  </s>
<s> But the reason you want to do this is because the element is _not_ legal in the DTD.  </s>
<s> Therefore the validation of multi-namespace documents needs to be defined.  </s>
<s> So we have a technical argument that you can't have namespace proposals of the form advocated without defining some new kind of validation behavior, or without creating a blanket exception from DTD conformance requirements for validating parsers.  </s>
<s> If you want to do something other than such partial DTD importation, like just attach unique IDs to elements of some sort, then you don't need namespaces, just a convention about how to use attributes.  </s>
<s> Clear now?  </s>
<s> Attach an attribute.  </s>
<s> You can use Notation or ENTITY valued attributes to associate an FPI with it, if you want.  </s>
<s> (2) grouping names so that,  </s>
<s> Each stylesheet looks at the attribute corresponding to its architecture.  </s>
<s> I thought this was well-understood procedure by now.  </s>
<s> If you use Attribute values to control processing, you can decouple or tightly couple DTD and semantics at your pleasure.  </s>
<s> As long as you stay away from allowing things in one DTD that are not declared in that DTD.  </s>
<s> I don't see a strong emphasis on this foundational point, and you're the first person to respond to my posts on the issue, so I may be getting a bit testy.  </s>

<s> 1) I've made a proposal for scoping arbitrary regions within a  </s>

<s> This allow the 'import' of a DTD or DTD fragment interpreting all identifiers as being in the namespace, e.g. !NS [ html: [ %htmldtd; ]] 2) I've made explicit something implicit in the Layman/Bray qualification proposal, which is, to abbreviate, that qualification  </s>
<s> inherits.  </s>
<s> So if I have after the above subsequent to the above, it's valid(atable) and the 'head' and 'body'  </s>
<s> are as per the html dtd, by qualification inheritance.  </s>
<s> I could of course just use qualified names explicitly in my own DTD, if I wanted to:  </s>
<s> with no id conflict between the two 'p1' IDs.  </s>
<s> The protected one could be ref'd from outside as 'localids:p1'.  </s>
<s> I have foolishly assumed that silence gives consent, and that the ERB were in due course going to ratify this story, but maybe I'm wrong, and in any case maybe it doesn't satisfy your requirements.  </s>
<s> If so, please advise.  </s>
<s> I certainly do NOT endorse any proposal which says that simply by qualifying a tag, the enclosing element's type's content model implicitly gets changed to allow that.  </s>
<s> If you want to use e.g. Dublin  </s>
<s> Core names and associate your use thereof with Dublin Core, e.g. (modified Layman syntax) /order then the content model for your 'order' element type better explicitly include 'dc:core'.  </s>
<s> ht  </s>
<s> I agree that this should be allowed.  </s>
<s> But given that, isn't your proposal (1) unnecessary.  </s>
<s> We can get valid XML documents that include namespaces without it.  </s>
<s> I agree something like it is nice, but I don't think we're ready to standardize it yet.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I think the basic concept that gis have a namespace part that inherits is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I agree with this.  </s>
<s> I can easily imagine wanting to combine element whose types come from different namespaces but have them share one ID namespace.  </s>
<s> I'm not at all sure it makes sense to bind the ID namespace to the element type namespace.  </s>
<s> Agreed. James  </s>
<s> It appears to me, that the discussion is actually somewhat abstract.  </s>
<s> The practical problem to be solved with namespaces is IMHO the following: 1.  </s>
<s> There is a need to reuse fragments of DTDs 2. There is a need to reuse fragments of instances - at least be able to simply cut &amp; paste such kind of fragments.  </s>
<s> As long as we have WF documents, item #1 is obviously not a problem.  </s>
<s> Item #2 is no problem as long as entire subtrees are shared.  </s>
<s> The namespace can be determined by the GI of one of the ancestors (which delimits the namespace).  </s>
<s> This can be done using most of the programming resp.  </s>
<s> style languages.  </s>
<s> The problem comes with valid documents!  </s>
<s> Item #1 requires to intermix the contentmodels without ambiguity (and without ANY :-).  </s>
<s> With the current spec, we get  </s>
<s> a sum  </s>
<s> over all content models (if we do not want to qualify the GIs of all tags).  </s>
<s> But what namespaces shoud switch content models and not mess them up esp.  </s>
<s> if we want to use a structured authoring tool.  </s>
<s> Reusing instance fragments should be possible with out renaming all elements,  </s>
<s> so a GI mangling approach isn?t helpful.  </s>
<s> After all that, we should look for a way to define context dependant content models.  </s>
<s> But I don?t see how this can be specified without changing DTD-Syntax.  </s>
<s> So its nothing for July 1st.  </s>
<s> Prefixing element names is a common practice in my daily work to distinguish varioius namespaces and to allow to share architectures.  </s>
<s> We have a minimal set of prefixes.  </s>

<s> We  </s>
<s> need something that is as easy to generate in this case as HTML anchor names (which are deliberately not unique) if we are to attract a wide range of authors to XML.

<s> Surely this is a similar problem to that addressed by Formal Public Identifiers: how to get globally unique names.  </s>
<s> The FPI solution is of course to prefix the name with organisation names and so on.  </s>
<s> If XML adopted a separator delimiter  </s>
<s> by convention (e.g. '::', where ':' is allowed as a NMCHAR) and gave some convention for use, like company::dtd::name (e.g. ms::cdf::amount ) you can cut and paste between XML documents with different namespaces today.  </s>

<s> XML is just starting.  </s>
<s> If terseness is not our goal, and people want to be able to make their documents cut-and-pastable, then why not add these conventions now, so that new DTDs have them?  </s>

<s> Now is exactly the time when we can make GIs (and other identifiers) more powerful.  </s>

<s> XML 2.0 can have the algorithm for minimising names, XML 1.0 just needs to set the data convention for making sure that names are unique in XML 1.0 documents, and therefore compatible with XML 2.0 fullname minimisation.  </s>
<s> Rick Jelliffe Back on casting.  </s>

<s> (e.g. make an int a pointer) which is regarded as poor, and type narrowing (casting to a typedef) which is regarded as good.  </s>
<s> There is no hint of type coersion in my use of 'cast'.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the ISO 8879:2001 SGML declaration should allow: CONCURNO-- e.g. para -- CONCURNAMESPACE -- e.g. martin::para -- CONCURYES-- e.g. (rick)p -- CONCURARCHITECTURE -- e.g. (martin::para)p -- where the last is a kind of architectural form.  </s>
<s> I am sure there is something nice hidden somewhere in CONCUR.  </s>
<s> In theory I agree, but only if we understand what we are doing.  </s>
<s> The attribute approach works now, and can be replaced by a better mechanism whenever we are _sure_ we have one.  </s>
<s> But if we add a _bad_ mechanism, we are stuck with it.  </s>
<s> That's the terrible downside of experimenting with a standard.  </s>
<s> I'm a techie who has tried his hand at teaching SGML and I've picked up some things.  </s>
<s> You can't teach marked sections because they use a parameter entity and people don't get at all what entities are about.  </s>
<s> So the conditional markup proposal Tim put out interested me greatly.  </s>
<s> You can teach anaything, but of course syntactically contorted things like marked sections require more contortion than elegant things like conditional markup.  </s>
<s> But we made a decision for compatibility.  </s>
<s> And we _have the expressive power_ as things already stand.  </s>
<s> You can't teach people to class elements with HyTime syntax.  </s>
<s> Just can't.  </s>
<s> But oddly, they can easily understand the class/namespace syntax.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced of this, but I agree that the notion of "namespaces" might have promise on a number of fronts.  </s>
<s> It just needs more work than it can get right now, and there are functional, existing alternatives to defining new syntax.  </s>
<s> So I have every reason to like the ':' proposal but I find myself agreeing with the statement above.  </s>
<s> Is there really real interest to do something with this even before we have fundamental things done like styles?  </s>
<s> Also a good point.  </s>
<s> Sure would, but we burned that bridge long ago... But it's still easy to experiment with DTD defining tools and notations, and standardize on something more capable once we have some practical experience.  </s>
