<s> Great stuff Pat.  </s>

<s> Pat, it is good to read that The entailment rules have been divided into a normative set corresponding to this simplified semantics, together with a statement and (appendix B) proof of a completeness result skipped to those and tested with and it's running well ;-) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
