<s> aloha, marjolein! the page from which i re-downloaded the executable does proclaim that the version is 4 august 2000, but the executable itself claims that it is the 30 april 2000 version... this could be due either to faulty mirroring, or to simply having forgotten to update the executable's verbiage to reflect the correct release date... so, i guess what i'm saying in plain english is that i did download tidy.exe, but instead of reporting that it was the 4 august 2000 release, it reports that it is the 30 april 2000 version... in any event, it runs flawlessly on the Win2k platform... gregory.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregory Sounds like the downloadable executable itself was switched on the server, then... the version I have definitely announces it's version 4 august 2000 when run! Cheers,  </s>
