Hi. This code: option value="S" Selected STOCK option value="F" FUND option value="I" INDEX converts to this code after I run HTML-Tidy: and I get a warning: discarding unexpected plain text 
Is this a bug?

Yes, it appears to be. 
I reported it last week, in fact. 
Unfortunately, I am a mere beginning C programmer and I have had no success so far finding the errant code.
