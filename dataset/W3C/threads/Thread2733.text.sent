On Fri 3/13/98 5:28 PM, the 'last LAST CALL' for three documents (v11-spec-rev, authentication, state-man-mec) was issued, and scheduled to expire March 27. 
We've since had several relatively minor issues raised with the first document (v11-spec-rev), but, more importantly, we're still looking for more complete implementation reports of a few features before forwarding this document on as Draft Standard. 
The second document (authentication) has had substantial comments, which I believe will require a revision and another (brief) last call. 
More importantly, we need better substantiation of testing of interoperability of the independent implementations. 
We're still hoping for Draft Standard status for these two documents together, since v11-spec-rev should not move forward without a credible authentication mechanism at the same maturity level. 
The last document (state-man-mec) has had no substantial comments, except that there are not independent interoperable implementations, and it seems possible that we just forward it on as Proposed Standard, which I will do forthwith. 
Larry The previous "last call" was pretty sudden. 
One thing that I don't like is nc-value = 8LHEX It should be nc-value = *LHEX Also in Authentication-Info I think it should be auth-info = 1#( [nextnonce] | [ message-qop ] [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ] [nonce-count] ) instead of auth-info = 1#(nextnonce | [ message-qop ] [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ] [nonce-count] ) with [] around nextnonce indicating that it is optional.

I was the one that specified the fixed size (implying leading zeros) originally (though I think that I used 4 rather than 8); my thinking was that it would avoid any potential problems with one side using the leading zeros and the other not. 
I can live with it either way. 
Agreed. 
How about doing what is done for the chunked TE and using lhex-no-zero = LHEX excluding "0" nc-value = lhex-no-zero *LHEX to forbid the leading zeros. 
I think that at least 99% of the time the nc-value will be a single digit. 
It is kind of wasteful and silly to require an enormous number of nc=00000001 fields. 
I suppose for backwards compatibility we should as servers to tolerate the leading zeros.
