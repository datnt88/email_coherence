With big thanks to Max Froumentin and other French W3C team members, we now have a fresh translation of the rdfs:label and rdfs:comment text for all RDF Core terms, ie. both schemas. 
Since MaxF is in Bristol it seemed a good chance to get this updated, so we've just had the odd experience of translating the likes of "the subject of the subject RDF statement." 
There were a fair few places where Max said it sounds a bit odd, but I believe those are mostly RDF's oddities rather than the translation. 
I think it is pretty faithful and literal, rather than attempting any major rephrasings. 
I've commited this into our shadow TR space, Deployment options: Ralph asked that we restore the French additions back into the document at the namespace URI. 
We could do this, but I fear it will create maintainance issues for us in the post-REC future. 
With the RDFS namespace doc, we always had an rdfs:seeAlso hypertext pointer to a 'more info' RDF file, I propose that we use that file, either directly or as a multi-lingual table of contents for this and other translations. 
A similar seeAlso pointer could be added to the M+S namespace. 
I propose they point to a single common 'French translation' document for now, rather than partitioning it into 2. I believe this will help establish the importance of hypertext linking in RDF documents (the 'Web' in 'Semantic Web') as well as provide a simple model for other translators to copy. 
I'm willing to be persuaded of other designs though; there doesn't seem to me to be an obviously 'right way' to deploy this. 
Ralph, do you have a strong preference for embedding the French translation rather than referencing it? 
There are also issues / opportunities w.r.t. use of language negotiation of such schemas, but that is too complicated and confusing for me to have any clear thoughts on right now. 
Suggestions welcomed... cheers, Dan Thanks, Max and Dan! 
I see this has only one language declaration: and this surprises me. 
None of the strings in this document are declared to be in 'fr' (hmm. 
XML question -- does xml:lang apply to the values of any attributes, such as the dc:title in the case above? 
I dunno. 
But I am certain that there's no way an RDF processor or an XML processor will know the labels and comments are intended to be in French.) yes, this proposal makes sense to me. 
me too ;) * Ralph R. Swick swick@w3.org 
[2003-08-08 10:01-0400] Oops, I meant to put it on a top element that enclosed the others; forgetting that Ontology was self-closing Ontology/ ... 
I'm just fixed it. 
Oh, interesting question! 
But I am certain that there's no way an You're right, it should have gone on the rdf:RDF. 
BTW I believe we're bypassing the current I18N debate since these labels/comments are plain literals not XML literals... (is that correct) And I'm glad we're not content-negotiating as well! 
Dan Hi Ralph, Doesn't XML say so? 
/me checks: "The intent declared with xml:lang is considered to apply to all attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless overridden with an instance of xml:lang on another element within that content." Max. 
really?! 
I'm very surprised (but pleased) if this is indeed the WG's consensus than an xml:lang on the root rdf:RDF element is sufficient to cause the graph to contain (in some manner) the information that all the strings are in French. 
great; thanks, Max. 
I was too lazy to look it up myself at the time.
