I chose Flash 4.0 and when it came up, it was flashing red and then short clips and then lots of flashing red, etc. Isn't this just slightly unaccessible to a person who has epilepsy? 
Flashing red like that can put some epileptics into a seizure. 
If this is the case I would consider this site totally unaccessible. 
When I tried to go back to main page, it wouldn't send me there, it just kept flashing the scenes on the browser.

It may not be an example of excellence as far as universality, but for accessibility it covers many of the holes in the WAI site. 
The homepage offers a choice of nine languages. 
It has a a limited number of links, each with a great graphic. 
It loads quickly. 
It does not use alt tags The topics and text labels are less well chosen than they could be. 
The coding is lengthy......

I don't think Jonathan was saying it is universally accessible (he effectively points this out), just that for a particular group of people (I am assuming he is talking about people with severe reading difficulties in particular - jonathan?) it is actually good. 
I think what we need to do is try to work out what it is that is good about this, and how we can explain how to do it, and combine that with what we already have and think we know.

Did "use meaningful labels for internal document anchors" not make it into the WCAG? 
For example, using A NAME="terminology" versus A NAME="targ12b" . 
If so, where is it? 
If not, isn't this a P2 or at least P3 usability issue? 
Aren't anchor names vocalized by screen readers? 
As far as I know, anchor names are not read by anything except machines. 
If you want a meaningful title for a section anchor you should use the title attribute.

Dear Charles, Thanks, but title is of no help -- and it's other peoples pages I want to see fixed! 
I guess I am thinking about the situation where the anchor is exposed in the location window. 
Also, I know I am not alone in my habit of browsing the source code in many situations. 
This seems like a legitimate P3 item to me, but perhaps I am alone in that opinion? 
Or is this a general design issue, and therefore not in the domain of the WCAG? 
"Use sensible file names for your HTML documents" is not in the WCAG either. 
Can anyone point me to a reference (with face validity) that includes such basics? 
Thanks. 
If you want to read the architecture documents, in which Tim Berners Lee describes the design goals behind the web, and how it should work, they are available on the W3C web site. 
They are not always easy to understand, but they are the principles that have guided the development of the web. 
The relevant ones to this discussion can be found at interesting reading - http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues Basically, the idea in designing the system was taht you need a way of referring to thinngs. 
So you give them a URI. 
Then you need a way of nt running out of URIs, and you need a way of people using them. 
So you invent an interface (links, that are text or something which describes the URI) for people to find things. 
THen it doesn't matter what the underlying information is. 
THis is important - what is meaningful in chinese, or to a chinese person writing an english document, or to an english person writing a chinese document, are different things. 
Too different to try and read meaning into the stuff that is there for the machine to understand, unless you are prepared to process entirely at the level of the machine. 
(There are cases where this is not true, but as an axiomatic requirement it tends to fail. 
Which is why people have strange names like McCathieNevile) cheers Charles McCathieNevile Dear Charles, Thanks, but title is of no help -- and it's other peoples pages I want to see fixed!

Using sensible file names is not a requirement nor should it be. 
The URI scheme is not meant to convey information or data -- it is meant to be an almost-entirely arbitrary system (once past the protocol and hostname identifiers) that associate arbitrary content with a unique identifier. 
There is no requirement that the unique identifier be human readable, human readable, human parsable, or convey any information at all apart from uniqueness.

This can get quite complex. 
It is valuable to be able to pass a URI on a napkin (although more valuable to pass it via email, since then you don't have to try and click the napkin, or read through the food on it). 
And for 
local maintenance it is often helpful to have something that vaguely makes sense. 
On the other hand, one of the biggest reasnos why finding things on the web today is so hard is becuase people change the names of things to reflect their new idea about how they are organised. 
This breaks everybody else's links to those things, from search engines to advertising, and people have to try and find where the new version is. 
Or run the risk that what they pointed to yesterday is a different thing today. 
Giving things names that are very meaningful means that you can deal with them easily, as can anyone who understands how you named things. 
But it also runs the risk of running out of names. 
There are societies where people are used to things changing names regularly, but they tend to be small, and the changes tend to be according to well-defined and understood rules. 
The web is not such a society. 
My personal view is that it is more important to make sure the names stay the same, so links don't all break, than that they are memorable. 
But there is no intrinsic reason for them not to be memorable just becuase. 
(It is a bad idea to try and read too much into a name, or to expect someone to have invented a scheme they can maintain for ever.) cheers Charles McCN 
If these objects (the files) were always accessed by clicking on links, we could say that safely. 
But that is not true. 
Mnemonic file names are valuable because the resource is accessed through the local file system as well as through URIs. 
And a basic requirement on URIs is that they be able to pass via a cocktail napkin to the "go to location" manual input of the broser User Interface. 
Read the RFC.

No, this is not always true either. 
It's very common to have a URI scheme on a site that has no consistent relationship to the local file system -- and with increasing use of database-backed web sites, this trend will continue. 
In many cases, there may not be a file system at all! 
The URI, however, may look much like a file system in a way that is opaque to the site user (but not the site programmer). 
Yes, I'm familiar with that scenario in the RFC, but that's not what's being discussed here -- transcribability simply means that the URI can be written down on paper and reproduced in the browser location window, it doesn't require that the URI _make sense_ to any arbitrary set of users. 
There's no requirement in the RFC that URIs contain human-readable content.

BTW, this is why frequent readers of my (other, longer) sig will have noticed that I use "plus links" -- such as http://kynn.com/+koosh 
(warning: picture content, no text description) -- when I am giving out link references in my signature file. 
These addresses don't correspond to filenames on the kynn.com 
server at all, but rather are server-level redirects that send people on to another destination. 
The +koosh URI, for example, redirects to one of my favorite pictures from the Virtual Dog Show. 
friendly. 
The .htaccess configuration file for kynn.com contains redirect statements that produce HTTP redirect responses, and your browser will automatically take you to the right location.

Clearly the short one. 
If you wanted to send someone one to the middle of the page will the server correctly handle .../+foo#middle ? 
But on Bruce's original question, anchor names appear in the UI in the status line in various browsers, and are relevant if you have to hand-enter the URL, and in that case mnemonic quality is a plus. 
As Kynn says, it is not a hard requirement; and at times it is hard to do with the rest of the URI. 
But all parts of a URI-reference including the anchor name or #fragment part are better to the extent that they can be made mnemonic. 
Al 
The other user who benefits from mnemonic anchor names is the author of another page somewhere else which has a use for a link to this point in the document. 
This was the logical point on which my software engineering background got the better of me at one point in the WAI history, as we were looking forward to the concurrent development of the three guidelines documents. 
If one is developing (i.e. changing) multiple documents with a need to refer to one another, it is the _inbound_ connecting points, the anchor _names_, that need to be stabilized (put under some form of change control, accountable to those holding dependencies) for others to point at. 
The outbound link points can change freely without upsetting dependencies from others. 
In this situation, it makes sense to think through a mnenonic system, because autonumber will defeat any desire for stability. 
On the other hand, I think that we do need to look at how the medium _is_ being used. 
A lot of what is moving to the Web today is not thought out in these terms. 
Maybe this is the wrong battle to be spending our time on. 
There is a general rule that from afar off, you ususally want to point the reader somewhere up the tree, not directly at a minute leaf level topic in someone else's site. 
Except for things like dictionaries, where the URL may well be in search-parameter format anyway. 
There is this problem with framesets, isn't there, that one cannot cite and retrieve with a URI-reference a given state in the frame-loading process? 
Then again, given that Google is the hot search engine of the moment, and what Google makes its hay out of, maybe people _should_ be giving more thought to what will help the poor sucker who _wants_ to link to some point in your page.

PS: Historical reference 
From: "Kynn Bartlett" 
This sounds like a reasonable way to write URIs, especially on napkins. 
I'd like to understand more about the advantages and disadvantages of doing this. 
Have you encountered anything interesting? 
I think that http://kynn.com/+koosh involves more than a good way to remember the location of a resource. 
What your doing is giving a URI to a URI. 
What kinds of characteristics does this imply? 
What if I put a link on my page, http://ben.com/+hairball, that points to http://kynn.com/+koosh? 
When alls said and done, the effect of following one of these links is that I go to http://www.dogshow.com/spring96/pictures/he0661-4.jpg 
You went a little further and put additional naming characteristics into your link " (warning: picture content, no text description) ", and this brings up issues with URI identity. 
You control the identity and significance of your URI, but you do not control the resource it points to. 
Your URI has a name with meaning, but the resouce (http://www.ma...etc...y=128) does not. 
This brings up controll of accessibility. 
Your sight can be less or more 
accessible depending on what URI's you generate, and what resources you point to. 
So my site's accessibility is dependant on your site. 
What kind of effects does this interdependance have? 
On an offshoot of this - when a person follows that link (http://kynn.com/+koosh) 
or any other like it, they are sent to an outside site - but perhaps expecting to stay within your site. 
Suddenly the formats and layouts all change and different browser requirements are created. 
This might be tough, for example, for screenreaders to handle. 
Thanks for you time,

Would a web site that has 'entirely accessible internal content' be considered accessible if it had links to non-accesible, external resources? 
Especially if those links to external resources add to the value of the site. 
For example, an accessible page of "The Top 10 Movie Sites", with links to movie sites that are non-accessible. 
Yes, I believe it would be. 
Unfortunately, you cannot be responsible for the accessibility of the sites you have links to unless the links go to your other pages. 
If the links go to sites that are outside of your site, one knows that the site design was done by someone else and may not be as accessible. 
Not all designers design for accessbility. 
Only those who are aware that accessbility is even an issue are the designers who strive to make their sites viewable to as many people as possible. 
IMHFO, Joyce 
Hi All! 
As I understand it, while we don't have controll of sites outside our own, sending people to a site that is not accessible for the purposes of remuneration may not be doing things accessably. 
In the case described below however, the linking is acceptable. 
It would be good though if you would inform the site to which you are linking that this has occured and inform them of the issues.

Thank you Al! (I am also grateful to the others who have enlightened me on this thread.) Okay, so where is an authoritative looking reference (with URI) for this common sense rule of thumb? 
I've handled this by linking to the "text-only" version of sites or by linking to an inside frame rather than a home page. 
If this doesn't work, I will include a short alert "warning, frames". 
Define "accessible." 
Yes, or else you can't allow links to -anywhere- that you can't control, in the name of "accessibility."

Providing information on the accessibility (as far as it is known) of the things at the other ends of the links would be helpful. 
With wide deployment 
of RDF and the so-called semantic web this will actually become easy, as well. 
But I agree that you cannot be held responsible for the things you point to (with some exceptions that are not especially relevant to the question).

Except that some things change a lot, and it's really unreasonable to expect a general interest, accessible site to take on that extra burden of checking the accessibility (continually) for each site it links to. 
For example, the HTML Writers Guild site strives for accessibility and the Guild promotes accessibility, but I don't think we can be expected to maintain a database of whether or not the web design resources we link to are accessible or not -- and to whom. 
Note: For specialty sites -- say, one of the "PWD portals" -- there might be a greater responsibility to link to accessible sites and warn if any links are known to be inaccessible. 
If there were an organization called the "Blind Web Designers Guild", for example, it would be reasonable to expect -their- resources lists to link to sites accessible to users with visual impairments.
