<s> Using sensible file names is not a requirement nor should it be.  </s>
<s> The URI scheme is not meant to convey information or data -- it is meant to be an almost-entirely arbitrary system (once past the protocol and hostname identifiers) that associate arbitrary content with a unique identifier.  </s>
<s> There is no requirement that the unique identifier be human readable, human readable, human parsable, or convey any information at all apart from uniqueness.  </s>
<s> Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> This can get quite complex.  </s>
<s> It is valuable to be able to pass a URI on a napkin (although more valuable to pass it via email, since then you don't have to try and click the napkin, or read through the food on it).  </s>
<s> And for  </s>
<s> local maintenance it is often helpful to have something that vaguely makes sense.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, one of the biggest reasnos why finding things on the web today is so hard is becuase people change the names of things to reflect their new idea about how they are organised.  </s>
<s> This breaks everybody else's links to those things, from search engines to advertising, and people have to try and find where the new version is.  </s>
<s> Or run the risk that what they pointed to yesterday is a different thing today.  </s>
<s> Giving things names that are very meaningful means that you can deal with them easily, as can anyone who understands how you named things.  </s>
<s> But it also runs the risk of running out of names.  </s>
<s> There are societies where people are used to things changing names regularly, but they tend to be small, and the changes tend to be according to well-defined and understood rules.  </s>
<s> The web is not such a society.  </s>
<s> My personal view is that it is more important to make sure the names stay the same, so links don't all break, than that they are memorable.  </s>
<s> But there is no intrinsic reason for them not to be memorable just becuase.  </s>
<s> (It is a bad idea to try and read too much into a name, or to expect someone to have invented a scheme they can maintain for ever.) cheers Charles McCN  </s>
<s> If these objects (the files) were always accessed by clicking on links, we could say that safely.  </s>
<s> But that is not true.  </s>
<s> Mnemonic file names are valuable because the resource is accessed through the local file system as well as through URIs.  </s>

<s> No, this is not always true either.  </s>
<s> It's very common to have a URI scheme on a site that has no consistent relationship to the local file system -- and with increasing use of database-backed web sites, this trend will continue.  </s>
<s> In many cases, there may not be a file system at all!  </s>
<s> The URI, however, may look much like a file system in a way that is opaque to the site user (but not the site programmer).  </s>
<s> Yes, I'm familiar with that scenario in the RFC, but that's not what's being discussed here -- transcribability simply means that the URI can be written down on paper and reproduced in the browser location window, it doesn't require that the URI _make sense_ to any arbitrary set of users.  </s>
<s> There's no requirement in the RFC that URIs contain human-readable content.  </s>

<s> BTW, this is why frequent readers of my (other, longer) sig will have noticed that I use "plus links" -- such as http://kynn.com/+koosh  </s>

<s> Clearly the short one.  </s>
<s> If you wanted to send someone one to the middle of the page will the server correctly handle .../+foo#middle ?  </s>
<s> But on Bruce's original question, anchor names appear in the UI in the status line in various browsers, and are relevant if you have to hand-enter the URL, and in that case mnemonic quality is a plus.  </s>
<s> As Kynn says, it is not a hard requirement; and at times it is hard to do with the rest of the URI.  </s>
<s> But all parts of a URI-reference including the anchor name or #fragment part are better to the extent that they can be made mnemonic.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> The other user who benefits from mnemonic anchor names is the author of another page somewhere else which has a use for a link to this point in the document.  </s>
<s> This was the logical point on which my software engineering background got the better of me at one point in the WAI history, as we were looking forward to the concurrent development of the three guidelines documents.  </s>
<s> If one is developing (i.e. changing) multiple documents with a need to refer to one another, it is the _inbound_ connecting points, the anchor _names_, that need to be stabilized (put under some form of change control, accountable to those holding dependencies) for others to point at.  </s>
<s> The outbound link points can change freely without upsetting dependencies from others.  </s>
<s> In this situation, it makes sense to think through a mnenonic system, because autonumber will defeat any desire for stability.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I think that we do need to look at how the medium _is_ being used.  </s>
<s> A lot of what is moving to the Web today is not thought out in these terms.  </s>
<s> Maybe this is the wrong battle to be spending our time on.  </s>
<s> There is a general rule that from afar off, you ususally want to point the reader somewhere up the tree, not directly at a minute leaf level topic in someone else's site.  </s>
<s> Except for things like dictionaries, where the URL may well be in search-parameter format anyway.  </s>
<s> There is this problem with framesets, isn't there, that one cannot cite and retrieve with a URI-reference a given state in the frame-loading process?  </s>
<s> Then again, given that Google is the hot search engine of the moment, and what Google makes its hay out of, maybe people _should_ be giving more thought to what will help the poor sucker who _wants_ to link to some point in your page.  </s>

<s> This sounds like a reasonable way to write URIs, especially on napkins.  </s>
<s> I'd like to understand more about the advantages and disadvantages of doing this.  </s>
<s> Have you encountered anything interesting?  </s>
<s> I think that http://kynn.com/+koosh involves more than a good way to remember the location of a resource.  </s>
<s> What your doing is giving a URI to a URI.  </s>
<s> What kinds of characteristics does this imply?  </s>
<s> What if I put a link on my page, http://ben.com/+hairball, that points to http://kynn.com/+koosh?  </s>
<s> When alls said and done, the effect of following one of these links is that I go to http://www.dogshow.com/spring96/pictures/he0661-4.jpg  </s>
<s> You went a little further and put additional naming characteristics into your link " (warning: picture content, no text description) ", and this brings up issues with URI identity.  </s>
<s> You control the identity and significance of your URI, but you do not control the resource it points to.  </s>
<s> Your URI has a name with meaning, but the resouce (http://www.ma...etc...y=128) does not.  </s>
<s> This brings up controll of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Your sight can be less or more  </s>
<s> accessible depending on what URI's you generate, and what resources you point to.  </s>
<s> So my site's accessibility is dependant on your site.  </s>
<s> What kind of effects does this interdependance have?  </s>
<s> On an offshoot of this - when a person follows that link (http://kynn.com/+koosh)  </s>
<s> or any other like it, they are sent to an outside site - but perhaps expecting to stay within your site.  </s>
<s> Suddenly the formats and layouts all change and different browser requirements are created.  </s>
<s> This might be tough, for example, for screenreaders to handle.  </s>

<s> Would a web site that has 'entirely accessible internal content' be considered accessible if it had links to non-accesible, external resources?  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, you cannot be responsible for the accessibility of the sites you have links to unless the links go to your other pages.  </s>
