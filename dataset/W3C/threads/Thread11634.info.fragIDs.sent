<s> I've attached a Brazilian Portuguese version of the WAI Quicktips, since the language differs somewhat from Portuguese as spoken in Portugal - specially in the use of anglicisms, which is very common here but not so in Europe.  </s>

<s> Sorry, left my brain in CVS yesterday.  </s>
<s> Here's my proper translation: Scripts, applets e plug-ins.  </s>
<s> Para o caso de estarem desabilitados ou de n&amp;atilde;o serem suportados pelo browser, forne&amp;ccedil;a conte&amp;uacute;do alternativo.  </s>
<s> Apart from that it looks fine.  </s>
<s> I'll have somebody revise it and let you know if anything comes up.  </s>
