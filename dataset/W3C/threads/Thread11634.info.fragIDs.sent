I've attached a Brazilian Portuguese version of the WAI Quicktips, since the language differs somewhat from Portuguese as spoken in Portugal - specially in the use of anglicisms, which is very common here but not so in Europe. 
The differences are not very deep, but some words are spelled completely different, and some are very awkward to us! Cheers, /\__ Christian Reis exists solely to answer kiko@async.com.br \ / Senior Engineer, Async Software Development Inc. \/ http://async.com.br/~kiko/ | 55 16 274 4311 
OK, I put it up at and I linked it from the QuickTips Translations page 
(note that you forgot one quicktip, the script/applet one - I used the portugese version) 
Sorry, left my brain in CVS yesterday. 
Here's my proper translation: Scripts, applets e plug-ins. 
Para o caso de estarem desabilitados ou de n&amp;atilde;o serem suportados pelo browser, forne&amp;ccedil;a conte&amp;uacute;do alternativo. 
Apart from that it looks fine. 
I'll have somebody revise it and let you know if anything comes up.
