<s> Dear Working Group, Here are some comments on issues not related to internationalization that I found when reading your User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.  </s>
<s> They are ordered more or less from high-level to low-level.  </s>
<s> - The range of browsers available currently is large, and is getting larger.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are largely written for general-purpose graphical desktop browsers, but this term only appears once 'en passant'.  </s>
<s> It should be very clearly said at the beginning that this is the core target, and how the guidelines apply to other cases.  </s>
<s> The intent of the guidelines was probably more general, but it is extremely difficult to be really general, and admitting that clearly early on may make it much easier for people to understand how to apply the guidelines in each case, and may significantly reduce dangerous and costly misunderstandings.  </s>
<s> - The text on 'applicable checkpoints' is crucial to understand how to apply the guidelines in various cases.  </s>
<s> It should be moved to section 1 to make sure it gets read early on, and to show that it is part of the definition of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> - Several guidelines are virtually identical or very close to general UI guidelines.  </s>
<s> This observation should be made early on.  </s>
<s> Some things seem so general that I wonder why the turn up in Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> For example, should 'general' users not be informed when following a link implies a fee?  </s>
<s> That should depend on the depth of the pocket of the user,  </s>
<s> not on accessibility issues, it seems.  </s>
<s> - The document contains a lot about deprecated technology, e.g. frames.  </s>
<s> There should be a comment saying that mentioning something does not necessarily mean it's a good feature for accessibility (see xxx guidelines), but that things are mentionned here nevertheless if they are sufficiently popular to justify support.  </s>
<s> - Guideline 9.2: I don't get this.  </s>
<s> Do you want to say tha it is in the currently selected viewport, i.e. that the viewport may have to be changed?  </s>
<s> Or that the point of regard has to be changed?  </s>
<s> - 10.1/10.2:  </s>
<s> I personally feel that showing author-set configurations is at least as important as user-set; many (not all) users may be able to remember to their own settings, while nobody will know author settings.  </s>
<s> - 10.3: Single-stroke/single-key: Does this include modifiers or not?  </s>
<s> There are in general not enough keys to have one (unmodified) for each function.  </s>
<s> What is a 'self-voicing' browser.  </s>
<s> - 10.7: Frequently requested commands: Are these new commands that are requested from the software manufacturer?  </s>
<s> If not, maybe better 'frequently used commands'.  </s>
<s> - Please separate out each Definition to make it accessible in the printed version (or e.g. put a pointer from 'Point of Regards', in its correct alphabetical position, to the entry where it's discussed).  </s>
<s> - Please rewrite the texts in the 'definition' section to read more like definitions of terms, or change the title, e.g. to Glossary, or background explanations.  </s>
<s> - On Netscape 4.0, the boxed Guideline titles disappeared when printed.  </s>
<s> Section 1.1: It will also will  </s>
<s> Priority 1 mentions users with disabilities, the other priorities don't.  </s>
<s> Is this on purpose?  </s>
<s> Double-A and Triple-A should also provide the original spelling (AA and AAA), to make sure users understand what is referred to.  </s>
<s> Conformance, Form 1: A list of checkpoints that have been satisfied and which are considered not applicable.  </s>
<s> Satisfying the checkpoints that are not applicable sounds really strange.  </s>
<s> Form 2: Link the icon to the ... W3C explanation: It is probably a good idea to also provide a link to the list of things satisfied/not applicable.  </s>
<s> 2.2: Closed closed captions  </s>
<s> Guideline 4: in including - including  </s>
<s> 4.17: No stylesheets: Does this mean that the default stylesheet applies, or what?  </s>
<s> Guideline 7: through rendered in - through rendering in?  </s>
<s> Refer also to guideline 10..: double period, there are more of these, but easy to find.  </s>
<s> Guideline 8: will assist the user understand - will assist the user to understand  </s>
<s> output device-independent: weird grouping/use of space and hyphen There are more of these, e.g. user agent-initiated  </s>
<s> 11.1: but one must be accessible - but at least one must be...  </s>
<s> Sorry, I have a few more points, mostly minor, but I have to leave now.  </s>
<s> Will send them tomorrow.  </s>

<s> I will take this into account as I edit the abstract for the next release (today).  </s>
<s> It used to appear in the section on conformance but the WG  </s>
<s> chose to move it to the glossary.  </s>
<s> However, many reviewers have focused on the definition and I strongly agree with your suggestion.  </s>
<s> Refer to issue #119  </s>
<s> A couple of comments here: 1) Several reviewers have wished that UI checkpoints (and Guidelines I suppose) be distinguished from content-related checkpoints.  </s>
<s> The solution we have in mind (identifying classes of checkpoints as UI- or content-related within the existing guidelines) may contribute to your suggestion that some are close to general UI guidelines.  </s>
<s> 2) Are you suggesting that we emphasize that good UI design is  </s>
<s> also related to accessibility?  </s>
<s> 3) The following statements appear in section 1.1 under "Ensure that the user interface is accessible": The general topic of user interface accessibility for computer software exceeds the scope of this document.  </s>
<s> The guidelines do discuss some important user interface topics such as device-independence, configurability, and accessible product documentation.  </s>
<s> Is this the type of statement you're looking for?  </s>
<s> We need a "pocket-depth" attribute, I guess!  </s>
<s> Such checkpoints exist so that developers will not assume, for example, that color alone is sufficient to indicate that following a link will cost money.  </s>
<s> I also believe that not all developers would find this as obvious as you do.  </s>
<s> Frames are not deprecated in HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> However, a note under  </s>
<s> checkpoint 6.2 about support for deprecated features might be useful.  </s>
<s> I propose: For reasons of backward compatibility, user agents should to continue to support deprecated features of specifications.  </s>
<s> The current guidelines refer to some deprecated language features that do not necessarily promote accessibility but are widely deployed.  </s>
<s> Suppose that the user is tabbing through links and the next link is outside of the current viewport's contents.  </s>
<s> When the focus is moved, the viewport should be scrolled so that the focus is in the viewport afterwards.  </s>
<s> Ok, I'll add that to comments on issue 112  </s>
<s> No, this doesn't include modifiers.  </s>
<s> The requirement of 10.3 is not that each functionality be bound to a single key, only that users be able to activate a functionality with a single key.  </s>
<s> For example, the user could select the 20 most important and configure the user agent for those 20.  </s>
<s> We'll discuss this when we discuss issue 134  </s>
<s> Changed to voice-activated.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> I'd rather change the section to "Glossary"  </s>
<s> You mean the entire title disappears, or just the box?  </s>
<s> Note that we provide PS and PDF versions for better printing.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> No, I'll fix.  </s>
<s> The original spelling is Double-A, not "AA".  </s>
<s> The WCAG WG decided not to use "AA" at all for reasons of speech synthesis, and we adopted their decision.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> That's my suggestion in issue 136  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Yes. Refer to issue 132.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> The second period is generated by a script.  </s>
<s> I'll be more careful.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Is this incorrect?  </s>
<s> We use "device-independent" and "output device" so why not "output device-independent"?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Thanks again Martin! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> Some comments on Ian's comments, and the rest of my comments.  </s>
<s> Good idea, but not my point.  </s>
<s> Well, in some way yes, of course.  </s>
<s> But not exactly my point.  </s>
<s> I'm looking for two things: - A statement that some of this stuff is close to, or related to, general guidelines for user interface design (which is more general than the (still general) topic of user interface accessibility).  </s>
<s> - Removal, or rewording, in cases where the accessibility guideline coincides with general user interface guidelines, for example like the next point, or things like 'state (e.g. of input devices) should always be 'visible'.  </s>
<s> That the state should always be visible is something very basic, and it might sourd as if e.g. Mac and Windows users (as opposed to Unix or DOS command users) all have some disability if you state that so generally.  </s>
<s> I see.  </s>
<s> In that case please change the wording to say so.  </s>
<s> Do you care if a developer provides a product that won't tell you whether you are charged for following a link or not?  </s>
<s> I guess you do.  </s>
<s> But is this an accessibility issue, if the developer decides to not show this info at all?  </s>
<s> I very clearly think no.  </s>
<s> He may not sell the product, but it should still conform to the guidelines, because it in no way disadvantages people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> They are not deprecated in HTML 4.0, but there is general agreement that they are not a good idea, for various reasons (URI problems, accessibility problems,...).  </s>
<s> I mean deprecated in this sense, probably there is a better word for it.  </s>
<s> I think the main reason is not backwards compatibility, but the amount of contents that still doesn't conform to e.g. the content authoring guidelines.  </s>
<s> And the note should be at the beginning of the document.  </s>
<s> to continue - continue  </s>
<s> Got it.  </s>
<s> Can you please make sure that the doc says that?  </s>
<s> So the requirement is that the user must be able to configure shortcuts, and in particular must be able to map some of them to single keys (i.e. one key without any modifier).  </s>
<s> So just change the text to make this clear.  </s>
<s> The entire title.  </s>
<s> Some of the box is still visible.  </s>
<s> That should be enough.  </s>
<s> missed them, sorry.  </s>
<s> I understand that.  </s>
<s> The main reason I'm a bit worried is that while in the US, everybody might easily immagine AA when reading Double-A, I'm not sure people all over the world will make this association as quickly.  </s>
<s> Mostly, they just have seen AAA and AA, and read it according to local conventions.  </s>
<s> No space between two words is the stronges binding.  </s>
<s> A hyphen is the next looser binding.  </s>
<s> A space is even looser.  </s>
<s> In 'output device independent', the binding is stronger between output and device than between device and independent, which is not matched by using a space for the former and a hyphen for the later.  </s>
<s> I suggest using something like 'independent of'.  </s>
<s> Here we go: Definitions, active element: with associated scripts ... associated repetition, remove one 'associated'.  </s>
<s> Assistive technologies: In the area of Web Accessibility, common software-based assistive technologies include assistive technologies, which rely on other user agents for input and/or output.  </s>
<s> These include: rewrite: In the area of Web Accessibility, common software-based assistive technologies include technologies that rely on other user agents for input and/or output, in particular: Continuous equivalent track: captions are rendered by being superimposed: on TV, of course they are superimposed, but on a PC, there is no need to superimpose them, usually there is enough space elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Control: Within the limits offered by the operating system or the user agent.  </s>
<s> I suggest you add hardware limits here.  </s>
<s> Documents,...: haveattributes: space missing is that which: improve wording.  </s>
<s> Events: 'Note.':  </s>
<s> wouldn't 'Note:' look better?  </s>
<s> this document will only refer to: change future tense to present.  </s>
<s> Focus: generally presented (e.g. highlighted) in a way that makes it stand out: highlighted is already defined to make things stand out, in a very general way, so you can just say 'The current focus is usually highlighted.'.  </s>
<s> Properties: Should 'ascribed' be changed to 'ascribed to'?  </s>
<s> Not sure.  </s>
<s> property'sdefault: Space missing.  </s>
<s> User Agent-initiated: space/hyphen problem again.  </s>
<s> Views,...: a window, frame, a piece: frame - a frame The view is how - The view corresponds to how, the view defines how,... user'spoint of regard: space missing.  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>

<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> A tool that doesn't tell you about a fee link at all is a bad too.  </s>
<s> A tool that tells some users but not users with disabilities is an inaccessible tool.  </s>
<s> You can use frames and make them accessible.  </s>
<s> I don't think that the WCAG says that frames are inaccessible (though they may not be a good idea).  </s>
<s> Authors need to make them accessible by providing alternatives that don't rely on 2-dimensional layout, etc.  </s>
<s> And user agents needs to give access to frames in a serial manner for those without graphical displays.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
