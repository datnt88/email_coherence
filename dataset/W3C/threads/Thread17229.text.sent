Is anyone else currently using this rather old document as a reference? 
Are there any more recent documents on SVG and Accessibility? 
articles, comments, anything? 
Would anyone be able to contribute any resources? 
Is anyone interested in updating this document?

Hello Jonathan John Gardener from Oregon State Uni is conducting research relating to accesible SVG. 
He has developed an early prototype of an accessible SVG viewer which can also output SVG in tactile format using the Tiger Braille embosser( see http://dots.physics.orst.edu/graphics.html ). 
John may also be able to suggest more up-to-date documentation. 
Denise Dr. Denise Wood Senior Lecturer and Program Director (multimedia studies) &amp; Magill Campus Director for MBIA and MBIC programs University of South Australia Dave Pawson has done work on voice browsing of SVG, there has been some other work done in various areas.
