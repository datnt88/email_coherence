snip 
done: see primerLCC-012 in the changes list 
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here (if you really mean danc-01). 
The Primer doesn't discuss graph equality. 
It also doesn't say 
anything about literals having language identifiers (and I seem to remember the WG taking an explicit decision that that was OK, although 
we can add that material if you want). 
done: see primerLCC-027 in the changes list (although, as Dave has noted in his comments, explaining this at the appropriate point in the Primer requires eliding what rdf knows vs. what rdfs knows). 
One bullet in Section 5.5 was changed where someone had pointed out a problem here (although this referred to class itself). 
I'm not sure what other wording in the Primer might cause someone to think that these concepts were being used intensionally .

Thanks, this was useful. 
Current status of my actions below. 
Short version: I think I'm finally up to date w/ RDFS edits except some minor presentational work. 
Awaiting feedback from Peter (and WG) on pfps-11 / pfps-12; pfps-11 in particular being rather vague and open-ended. 
Dan 
Done (finally). 
I referenced the issue and the public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf list as follows: Note: that this technique creates a mixed-format document which cannot (as of August 2003) be validated as HTML. 
The RDFCore Working Group consequently encourage metadata to be linked from rather than embedded in your HTML documents. 
See the RDF Core issue resolution on this topic for details. 
The public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf mailing list has been established to investigate strategies for embedding RDF that support HTML validation 
TODO. 
Done. 
I didn't find any. 
does that to my satisfaction. 
I can't think of a concise way of adding a bigger health warning for the monster that is reification. 
Proposed done. 
Stale. 
We have resolutions for everything except pfps-11, and closures for everything except that and pfps-12. 
Done, awaiting reply from DanC. 
done. (I added a dc:title too.) 
Done per http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0223.html 
All done except the re-ordering for presentation purposes, which is a minor editorial still on my todo list. 
Failed / Stale. 
pfps-11 is back with Peter -- inviting editorial propsoal pfps-12 edits are made -- inviting review of rdf:List by WG &amp; Peter 
Done,
