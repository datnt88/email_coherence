I think that it would be a good idea to hold an HTTP/1.1 interoperability demonstration event. 
The goal would be to showcase the commitment of all participants to the 1.1 standard and to discover interoperability prolems. 
This kind of event has been done before for other network protocols, and is a great way to get media attention and to 'focus the minds' of developers. 
There are a number of things to be agreed upon; I present my first cut at such a list just to get the ball rolling: Venue (When &amp; Where): It seems to me that the most natural venue would be Networld/Interop, since the Interop part of that event was originally organized around just this sort of thing. 
The last Interop in Las Vegas featured an interoperability demonstration of multicast IP vendors. 
However, the next one in Atlanta (Oct) is too soon, and the one after that in Las Vegas (May 98) is too late. 
Of course, theoretically at least we could just do the whole thing over the Internet... if all particapants used published host names and had a telephone contact for each host name... 
Goals: 
I'd like to see a list of demonstration goals; probably the MUST and SHOULD list from HTTP/1.1 would be a good starting point, 
which means that there would be more than one set of goals: origin 
servers, proxies, and browsers. 
(If we did get together physically we could organize it that way physically - browsers at one end, origin servers at the other, and proxies in between :). 
Non-Goals: I'd also like to see some ground rules for things we agree _not_ to do so that we keep the message positive and simple enough for our friends in the media to get right. 
This is about HTTP/1.1, so demonstrations of integration with mail, ftp, video streaming and other non-HTTP operations should be out of bounds (or at least clearly separate from the HTTP demonstrations). 
This is not about making other vendors look bad; it is about making the protocol look good. 
To the extent that there needs to 
be any final statement from the event organization, it should come from neutral third parties (perhaps we could recruit some interested academics who are not connected to any vendor?). 
I've copied this to the W3C http list just to pick up any interested parties there; perhaps this could actually be done under thier auspices? 
Thoughts?

(Interoperability event) 
I agree. 
origin servers -- Compatibility, thread management and memory usage proxies -- Compatibility, tendency to kill pipeline browsers -- User Agent testing scripts, cache behaviour, speed 
Also, we should keep-away from virtual protocols (RSVP over IP) and network bandwidth reservation.

Agree 
My feelings here are that this is a LINUX like activity: This should be done over the net, and immediately -- let's create a list of servers, their download locations and installation notes, -- Let's move this to a different list (or create another list) Open items: 1. 
A definitive list of the available for download HTTP 1.1 compliant servers (IIS4, Apache, Jigsaw, etc.) 2. HTTP 1.1 compliant browsers (communicator, ie, etc.) list and download sites. 
3. Participating webmasters list 4. Hardware inventory for the servers from (3) Once this is in place, we can draft up a testing plan. 
I can set up a couple of servers for this to handle a list as soon as (or if) we hit consensus.

I think we were really thinking more of an 'interoperability test' than an 'interoperability demonstration'. 
The goal is 'figure out whether people's HTTP/1.1 implementations work with each other, and if not, what's wrong'. 
A secondary goal is 'document interoperable use of each HTTP/1.1 feature with independent implementations', in order for us to move to 'draft standard' status. 
That means that a checklist going down HTTP/1.1 headers and seeing if they're emitted, responded to correctly, etc., in various combinations would be a good idea. 
I think it's important that organizations be able to test implementations anonymously, so that there's no press leakage or story telling.

TR origin servers -- Compatibility, thread management and memory usage By thread management I assume you refer to persistent connection usage - that seems like a good idea (how often does server X force a close?). 
TR My feelings here are that this is a LINUX like activity: This should be TR done over the net, and immediately -- let's create a list TR of servers, their download locations and installation notes, TR -- Let's move this to a different list (or create another list) There is a list of servers available on the net today at the HTTP/1.1 Implementors Forum @ W3C: Until Larry tells us this needs to move, I think that we can continue to use this list. 
TR 4. Hardware inventory for the servers from (3) I think that the event organizers need provide no more than a network; vendors will expect to bring thier own platform hardware.

LM I think we were really thinking more of an 'interoperability test' LM than an 'interoperability demonstration'. 
The goal is 'figure LM out whether people's HTTP/1.1 implementations work with each other, LM and if not, what's wrong'. 
LM A secondary goal is 'document interoperable use of each HTTP/1.1 
LM feature with independent implementations', in order for us to LM move to 'draft standard' status. 
That means that a checklist going LM down HTTP/1.1 headers and seeing if they're emitted, responded LM to correctly, etc., in various combinations would be a good idea. 
That being the case, I assume that we would like this to take place before the December IETF (which I was going to suggest as another possible venue). 
Organizing a physical get-together that soon may be challenging unless someone steps up quickly (all you academics out there - this is your chance to become to HTTP/1.1 what UNH is to FDDI and Scott Bradner at Harvard is to Bridge/Router testing!). 
LM I think it's important that organizations be able to test LM implementations anonymously, so that there's no press leakage or story LM telling. 
As I noted in my last note, a few of us have publicized the locations of 1.1 origin servers that may be used for testing by anyone (we log the Server line from requests to our server, but we don't talk with anyone about the specifics of what we see). 
We've all seen postings here resulting from various people doing testing with them. 
I've asked for publicly usable 1.1 proxies and not gotten any response. 
We've also done some testing with the 1.1 clients that we've been able to get, and communicated issues to the authors where we found them, but as I said in my first note, an event at a fixed place and time tends to focus the attention of all concerned and produce more definitive results than the kind of ad hoc testing that is going on now. 
I think that there is some value in a publically visible event because for the good of the net as whole we would like to see 1.1 displace 1.0 as quickly as possible; the only way that will happen is if the web users and especially server operators see it as something worth upgrading to get. 
Perception is important. 
That having been said, the public event could easily be separate and much later than the kind of test you suggest, Larry, and perhaps that is the better course to pursue. 
We are eager to participate in either or both.

SDL As I noted in my last note, a few of us have publicized the SDL locations of 1.1 origin servers that may be used for testing by SDL anyone (we log the Server line from requests to our server, but we SDL don't talk with anyone about the specifics of what we see). 
We've SDL all seen postings here resulting from various people doing testing SDL with them. 
I've asked for publicly usable 1.1 proxies and not SDL gotten any response. 
Having checked with my boss, I can now do this one better. 
Any vendor interested in doing interoperability testing with our 1.1 origin server anonymously _off_ the Internet should contact me. 
I can produce a binary version of our server that we can provide you to experiment with. 
All we ask is that: - You don't give it to anyone else. - Any problems you find with it you tell us, and only us (if we disagree about whether or not something is a problem we can bring the question to this list together).

We have (at least) three kinds of agents: clients, proxies, origin servers and probably 'proxy' has several variations. 
Let's suppose we have C1, C2,..Cnc, P1, P2, P3, and O1, O2, ... Ono. 
We should test each HTTP operation with at least a reasonable set of combinations of headers and header values through all nc * np * no combinations client, proxy, and origin server. 
We should test chains of 0, 1, 2, ... n proxies, against HTTP/1.0 versions of legacy clients, proxies &amp; servers. 
I'd like to test entity tags, if-match, vary headers, caching, cache timeout, last-modified, redirects, etc. 
We should do some stress testing, aborted connections, persistent connections, connections in the face of (faked) network failures. 
I think we could manage to get 6-7 clients, 8-9 proxy servers, and 10 origin servers. 
We probably should generate some kind of dummy test client, dummy test proxy and dummy test server for systematically running through various error messages. 
I don't know how we can test cookies. 
Let's plan on making this a regular event, rather than getting it all right the first time. 
I'd rather mainly plan to do it on the net rather than a physical event.
