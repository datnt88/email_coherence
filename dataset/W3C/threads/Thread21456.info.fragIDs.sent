<s> Hi, * sbp thought of doing an arithmetic built-in next: cwm_math.py  </s>
<s> * tim says go ahead!  </s>
<s> Done,  cwm_math.py  .  </s>
<s> CWM can now do addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, remainders, negation, exponentiation, count the members in a DAML list, and do the normal truth checking functions, only sub classed for numeric values (cf.  </s>
<s> list of actual property names [1]).  </s>
<s> I hope you don't mind, but I simply nicked a SWAP namespace:- I've written up the schema, and attached it as  math.n3  .  </s>
<s> The test file is also attached as  math-test.n3   </s>
<s> , the output as math-test-out.n3  (command line at [2]).  </s>
<s> The "biggest" test is:- { :x math:sumOf ([ math:quotientOf ("7" "2") ] [ math:exponentiationOf ([ math:remainderOf ("7" "2")] "10000000") ] [ is math:memberCount of ("a" "b" "c" "d" "e") ]) } log:implies { :x :valueOf "(7 / 2) + ((7 % 2)^10000000) + 5 [should be 9.5]" } .  </s>
<s> which gives the correct output:- "9.5" :valueOf "(7 / 2) + ((7 % 2)^10000000) + 5 [should be 9.5] .  </s>
<s> llyn.py  is also attached, since I needed to modify it to recognize the built-ins.  </s>
<s> Note also the development process [3].  </s>
<s> Cheers, [1] List of the properties: sumOf, differenceOf, productOf, quotientOf, remainderOf, negationOf, exponentiationOf, memberCount, greaterThan, notGreaterThan, lessThan, notLessThan, equalTo, notEqualTo.  </s>

<s> great stuff!  </s>
<s> I'm not sure about "...Of" names.  </s>
<s> TimBL's been shying  </s>
<s> away from those, going toward roll nouns (brother/sister... sum).  </s>
<s> Also, nicking the namespace name... hmm...  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I did it that way so that you could use the [ :p :o ] bNode construct as values, without having to keep resorting to "is x of".  </s>
<s> If you *really* don't like them, it only takes a few search and replaces to substitute the inverses, although I'm pretty sure that they'll be used most in their current direction.  </s>
<s> Note that "memberCount" is not a ReverseFunction.  </s>
<s> Heh, heh, heh...  </s>
<s> I just had to "take the liberty" :-) The "math:" prefix is referred to in the Notation3 Primer [1], but there's no mention of it elsewhere that I know of.  </s>
