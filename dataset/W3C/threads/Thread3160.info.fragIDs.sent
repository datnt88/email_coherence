<s> Hierarchical displays are used in a wide number of thesauri of  </s>
<s> different styles.  </s>
<s> Let me provide an example.  </s>
<s> Suppose we want to build a browsable hierarchical display like found in the AAT hierarchy display for Chairs [1].  </s>
<s> (Incidentally similar kinds of displays are also provided for other kinds of thesauri, for instance see Plant products in AGROVOC [2]).  </s>
<s> My math skills are not very strong, but if I understand the SKOS API correctly, I think this requires 53 separate calls to getConceptRelatives (and what is worse probably the equivalent of 53 separate SQL queries in the underlying thesaurus system).  </s>
<s> Contrast the SKOS API with the ADL API [3], where calls can return a large quantity of information to the client in a single network request.  </s>
<s> More importantly, a compound call like that can probably be supported with two SQL statements on the thesaurus system side.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> In thesauri that support hierarchical displays, it is common that a notational system is used (at least internally) which is expressive of not only place in the hierarchy but number of levels, or alternatively that level information is stored explicitly within the record for each concept.  </s>
<s> If the thesaurus server has this thesaurus-specific knowledge, supplying all the terms lower in the hierarchy to five levels, for example, could conceivably be done with a single SQL statement.  </s>
<s> By relying on more processing on the server and using a higher level API, the performance in terms of the time required to return the information to build the hierarchical display could, I think, be vastly reduced.  </s>
<s> See also the comments of Binney and Tudhope [4] when looking at this problem of hierarchical displays in the AAT supporting the notion of compound API calls.  </s>
<s> Now, there may be very good reasons for this low-level API approach of which I am not aware.  </s>
<s> My question is this: will this not result in some extremely slow response in certain important contexts relative to what a composite API could provide?  </s>

<s> Hi Ron I am working as a technical developer on the SKOS API and a demo implementation of it and very much welcome your input.  </s>

<s> 1) We do provide (see methods such as getConceptRelativesByPath(Concept concept, Relation relation, URI thesaurus, int distance) Which we describe as 'Get a list of concept relatives for a particular thesaurus up to some distance.'  </s>
<s> And by 'up to some distance' we mean 'number of levels' in the sense that I  </s>
<s> believe you to be talking about below.  </s>
<s> So this avoids the need for repetitive calls to the service to retrieve concepts 'clustered' around some concept in the concept hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Instead, in response to these sorts of service requests we intend to return sets of concepts.  </s>
<s> We haven't finalised our strategy for indicating exactly how distant each result-set concept is from a given point in the graph ... (And I note that this issue relates to the syntax we use for encoding the response data the service can send to the client.  </s>
<s> For our initial SOAP service implementation we are using the soap data encoding syntax and will likely move on to include support for XML as well as RDF/XML).  </s>
<s> 2) You may well have already seen the use cases we're developing at (in need of updating shortly, since I've received more contributions from the community).  </s>
<s> I hadn't really imagined that client applications would want to build extensive, browsable displays of concept hierarchies via the network and 'on the fly' as it were.  </s>
<s> But this is an interesting point and I wonder if we need to provide some harvesting capability on the service as well....  </s>

<s> I agree with Ron, though I would be interested to know the views of the folk closer to the mechanics of how this would work.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there is a difference depending on whether you are retrieving a display for a human to look at or specific terms for a machine to use.  </s>
<s> It would certainly seem more efficient for a server to return a complete hierarchy in response to a single request; most standard thesaurus management software can display such hierarchies, constructing them when needed by following the chain of BT/NT links.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it should be necessary to store "level" information to achieve this, and indeed I think that doing so would complicate matters, because if a concept is inserted to create a new level of grouping then the "levels" of all the subordinate concepts would change.  </s>

<s> Hi Leonard  </s>
<s> Yes, skos takes the approach of expressing broader/narrower/related relationships between concepts.  </s>
<s> If we are to add what is effectively harvesting functionality to the thesaurus, then we would likely return skos encoded data as is, from which some client app would be able to build a thesaurus browser if required.  </s>
<s> If time permits we may demonstrate how this would work against our own demo thesaurus service implementation.  </s>
<s> For example either by layering Protege on top of our service for browser-based views on the data, or developing prototype viewer implementations that we already have.  </s>

<s> Leonard  </s>
<s> I think Ron was referring to a "number of levels" parameter in the API call  </s>
<s> (ie in SKOS getConceptRelativesByPath) - a relative number of levels (or relationship traversals) from the given concept.  </s>
<s> It could include the whole hierarchy but might not necessarily in some large thesaurus applications where you wanted a local context display centred around the given concept.  </s>
<s> Thus 'Level no'.  </s>

<s> You might want to specify separately "number of levels up" and "number  </s>

<s> Hi Andy  </s>
<s> Thanks for the information in this email - I'll have a look at these references you cite.  </s>
<s> I'd like to mention here (as earlier in this thread) that the SKOS API is use case driven.  </s>
<s> I believe that the SKOS API provides a good initial attempt at defining the basis of functionality for some thesaurus service.  </s>
<s> Now that service might be a web service, or it might not - it might instead represent a programmatic interface for some application.  </s>
<s> So we are not necessarily constrained by network considerations (&amp; I would also perhaps throw in the word "Grid" in at this point :-)).  </s>
<s> Should some application require a service's complete thesaurus hierarchy it could potentially harvest the data periodically, and store it locally in order to use it for whatever functionality its client app (e.g. browser-based thesaurus viewer) might require.  </s>
<s> [and that client app itself might well adhere to the SKOS API specification].  </s>
<s> There are harvesting protocols that could apply here e.g. OAI (http://www.openarchives.org/).  </s>
<s> In a different scenario, suppose some client application did not wish to be potentially overloaded by large response data sets from a thesaurus web service, well, this situation has been tackled before in the sphere of network search and retrieval.  </s>
<s> For example see service that can handle some notion of state such that a client may negotiate with the service how large a result set it is prepared to receive.  </s>
<s> And so on .... Regards, Nikki  </s>

<s> Nikki, 1) Oops.  </s>
<s> I guess the getConceptRelativesByPath didn't register with me when I was working my way through the API, since it returns only an array of Concepts, which (as you point out) doesn't help much since there is no indication of distance or structure.  </s>
<s> I'm intrigued by your notion of supporting another XML format (which I wonder?) and will stayed tuned for further updates... 2) As for the use cases, Dan Brickley wrote :  </s>
<s> I doubt we can specify the human-readable offerings of thesaurus providers in such detail, beyond noting best practice conventions and common useful UI conventions.  </s>
<s> What we can do, though, is take these as use cases for evaluating the _machine_ interface defined in the SKOS API.  </s>
<s> We can ask ourselves whether such a UI could be built against any/all SKOS servers that meet the API.  </s>
<s> This opens up the prospect of write-once, re-use elsewhere thesaurus browsing tools...  </s>
<s> Dan's first point, about specifying the human-readable offerings of thesaurus providers is not a problem, that's been done (and is being revised) in the appropriate national and international standards and in best practices.  </s>
<s> What I was trying to help do was what Dan was suggesting in his second point, that is, evaluating the appropriateness of the SKOS API for building some of those common UIs.  </s>
<s> My comments are not intended as a criticism of your work, this is complex stuff, but I think there have been a number of problem areas mentioned where the machine interface is not yet up to this task.  </s>
<s> IMHO this is (or should be) an important issue for SWAD, because it will affect adoption of the SKOS API.  </s>
<s> If thesaurus publishers have to support one API to interact with the Semantic Web, and another interface to interact with fully functioned thesaurus clients, then they will be inclined to implement _neither_.  </s>
<s> Having a single interface that will support a reasonably complete set of functionality (and there is a huge overlap) means everyone wins.  </s>
<s> For one thing, the API would be a machine interface that those national and international thesaurus standards (now in the process of being revised) would be able to endorse.  </s>
