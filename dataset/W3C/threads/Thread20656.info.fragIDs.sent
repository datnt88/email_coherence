Hi everyone Is it possible to use Amaya to write and store word processor type documents? 
We presently use Word (and Excel) to write reports and would like to start 
writing natively in XML with the minimum of difficulty. 
I know we can use text 
editors like Abortext and S4Text but is there an easier way? 
I assume that everyone will soon want to create their word 'processed documents' 
in XML. 
I would just like to know what the easiest and most future proofed 
method is.

Bonjour,

Amaya is a web graphic editor. 
Take a look at www.openoffice.org 
for an "XML writer" (as an XML Office suite)... Regards, Guy Capra, Alomphega.

If XHTML, MathML and SVG is enough complete for you you can use Amaya as it is today. 
If you want to create another type of XML document you have to wait for the XML generic support in Amaya.

How can I create a XML document using Amaya? 
Is it possible? 
Please excuse-me step by step. 
Thanks, Beatriz. 
Today you can only create XHTML, MathML and SVG document. 
The generic support of XML is in progress. 
We hope to have a first version by September 2001. 
Regards Irene. 
But, how Amaya supports XLink and XPointer? 
How can I work with XLink and XPointer using Amaya? 
Yes Amaya handles also a subset of XLink and XPointer. 
When you create a link from an MathML or an SVG element you genereate an XLink. 
We use also XPointer in the annotation application. 
We can do more by generalizing the use of XPointer and XLink, but resulting documents could be readable by Amaya only. 
Our plan is to add a new command that generate an XPointer corresponding to the current selection and a command that generates a XLink to this XPointer. 
Is there other available tool in W3C that I can use XLink and XPointer with a XML document? 
All available tools are listed at: http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking Regards Irene.
