<s> Hi everyone Is it possible to use Amaya to write and store word processor type documents?  </s>
<s> We presently use Word (and Excel) to write reports and would like to start  </s>
<s> writing natively in XML with the minimum of difficulty.  </s>
<s> I know we can use text  </s>
<s> editors like Abortext and S4Text but is there an easier way?  </s>
<s> I assume that everyone will soon want to create their word 'processed documents'  </s>
<s> in XML.  </s>
<s> I would just like to know what the easiest and most future proofed  </s>
<s> method is.  </s>

<s> If XHTML, MathML and SVG is enough complete for you you can use Amaya as it is today.  </s>
<s> If you want to create another type of XML document you have to wait for the XML generic support in Amaya.  </s>

<s> How can I create a XML document using Amaya?  </s>
<s> Is it possible?  </s>
<s> Please excuse-me step by step.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Beatriz.  </s>
<s> Today you can only create XHTML, MathML and SVG document.  </s>
<s> The generic support of XML is in progress.  </s>
<s> We hope to have a first version by September 2001.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> But, how Amaya supports XLink and XPointer?  </s>
<s> How can I work with XLink and XPointer using Amaya?  </s>
<s> Yes Amaya handles also a subset of XLink and XPointer.  </s>
<s> When you create a link from an MathML or an SVG element you genereate an XLink.  </s>
<s> We use also XPointer in the annotation application.  </s>
<s> We can do more by generalizing the use of XPointer and XLink, but resulting documents could be readable by Amaya only.  </s>
<s> Our plan is to add a new command that generate an XPointer corresponding to the current selection and a command that generates a XLink to this XPointer.  </s>
<s> Is there other available tool in W3C that I can use XLink and XPointer with a XML document?  </s>
<s> All available tools are listed at: http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking Regards Irene.  </s>
