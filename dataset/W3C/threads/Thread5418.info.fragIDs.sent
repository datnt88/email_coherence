Hi, 
I've start collecting material from the Web related to the Eolas '906 patent. 
Here's a draft version of the backgrounder: 
If you have any suggestions for addition material, please send along any relavent links. 
Thanks, Richard M. Smith 
Thank you Richard, this will be helpful to pass around to my colleagues. 
I especially like one of the links off http://news.google.com where it highlights that MS potentially could own $1.3 Billion by the end of the appeal process. 
I think whatever changes are coming, will come sooner than we expect...........

From http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1995JulAug/0456.html (1995): ac5ee5e50002100476c4@[192.187.143.12] ): 
I'm somewhat familiar with the subject of the patent; we even interviewed one of its inventors for a Web technical lead position at Verity, about a year ago. 
I'm not particularly worried about the impact it would have on things like Java and such. 
I believe that this invention was shopped around to various companies. 
One might read a bit into the fact that in the end, it wasn't acquired by a third party but by a company led by the inventor. 
Of course, this might mean either that it's so valuable that no one else could afford it... or it could mean that no one else thought it was worth acquiring. 
Please note what happened here. 
Whether this was shopped around or not, what we see here is a transfer to a private entity of the fruits of a publicly-funded research effort. 
This is "valid" only because of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act. 
Remember that? 
The whole software patent debacle came about, in large measure, as a result of Bayh-Dole. 
The Bayh-Dole Act is responsible for the fact that software patents have been able to go so far without the benefit of being held to review according to the most ordinary considerations of public policy principles related to exclusive rights. 
Throughout the history of universities, academia has long been the chief articulator of the principles according to which software patents would plainly be seen as of dubious worth, the most natural champion that understands the intrinsic public good that is knowledge as such. 
The Bayh-Dole Act "bought out" academia for the software patent issue. 
It said that software developed with public funds at academic research institutions could be transferred to private entities in highly lucrative deals (sealed from public view). 
So while many academicians have noted the problem with software patents, Bayh-Dole turned their institutions against them -- and therefore against the prospect of their institutions finding their natural voice in support of them. 
Mike Doyle was only able to acquire private rights to this "software patent" because of Bayh-Dole. 
It's not so much a question of the quality of the patent as evidenced by speculation that it was "shopped around" and ostensibly only acquired by the inventor himself in the end. 
The inventor developed the technology while he was employed by the University of California, from which he acquired the rights to it -- and he did so with the support of the university's "technology transfer" office. 
You can see the actual genesis in the press release below. 
Seth Johnson From: srctran@world.std.com (Gregory Aharonian) Subject: PATNEWS: Eolas claiming rights to embedded apps over the Web Date: 1995/08/22 newsgroups: misc.int-property,misc.legal.computing,comp.software-eng,comp.infosystems.www.misc 
EOLAS ACQUIRES COMMERCIAL RIGHTS TO KEY WORLD WIDE WEB PATENT 8/21/95 CHICAGO: Eolas Technologies Inc. announced today that it has completed a licensing agreement with the University of California for the exclusive rights to a pending patent covering the use of embedded program objects, or "applets," within World Wide Web documents. 
Also covered is the use of any algorithm which implements dynamic bi-directional communications between Web browsers and external applications. 
This development will have a major impact on the ability of Internet content providers to exploit the expanding interactive capabilities of the Web to gain advantage in the highly competitive online market. 
Currently, various combinations of embedded applets and software development APIs (application development interfaces) are major features of Web browsers from Netscape, Spyglass, Microsoft, AOL/Navisoft, NeXT, and Sun Microsystems (especially Sun's new Java language. 
A quote from the current Forbes ASAP states "Browsers and servers may come and go, but Sun's breakthrough Java language, OR SOMETHING LIKE IT, will be the key to a truly interactive Internet..."). 
Talks have been going on for several months between Eolas and several of these companies regarding both the licensing of the underlying technology and associated products. 
The licensed technology was invented in 1993 by a team led by Eolas CEO, Dr. Michael Doyle, a UCSF faculty member and past Director of the university's academic computing center. 
Prior to joining UCSF, Dr. Doyle was Director of the Biomedical Visualization Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
He received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was active in the area of scientific informatics and collaborated with several members of National Center for Supercomputing Applications, the birthplace of Mosaic. 
According to Dr. Doyle,"We recognized early on that the Web could be expanded beyond the limits of plain vanilla HTML document browsing to become an all-encompassing environment for interactive applications. 
We then developed an enhanced version of the recently-announced NCSA Mosaic program that added technology which enabled Web documents to contain fully-interactive "inline" program objects, called Weblets (by Eolas), which one could manipulate in place using the enhanced Mosaic program." 
The first Weblet created was an interactive 3D medical visualization application which employed a three-tier distributed object architecture over the Internet to allow a "farm" of powerful remote computers to generate images of internal human anatomy in response to the Mosaic user's interactive commands, all from within Mosaic. 
This allowed a user with nothing but a low-end networked workstation and the Eolas browser to transparently access supercomputer-level power and interactively look inside an MRI scan of the human body which was embedded within a Web page. 
The Eolas technology will soon be available for licensing. 
Information and demonstrations are available at the Eolas World Wide Web home page (http://www.eolas.com).

Original authorship should be attributed reasonably, but only so far as such an expectation might hold for usual practice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no claim of exclusive rights. 
Richard, There is no coincidence that 1996 was an important year for Mr. Doyle. 
There was a software patent court case in the 1990s that I knew to exist that relaxed the software-based patentability guidelines. 
So I did a search and found the following: The above may be useful for people who want to understand how the software patent laws have changed and why this patent exist and why there is such an 
avalanche of silly software patents in the first place in the last few years. 
Ok, ready to hear the real story of what's going on here? 
g Microsoft is just as guilty as others filing silly software patents for everything under the kitchen sink. 
Based on this, Microsoft is faced with a 
big dilemma in regards to this patent. 
If they appeal this patent and win, I believe it will have to based on an argument that will reverse the 1998 court ruling. 
If this was to happen, many of the hundreds of the software patents Microsoft has been issued will 
be null and void. 
So Gates on the one hand does not want to give up control to some little "peon" company for an important concept that is and will be even more of a critical ingredient in the inevitable thin/slim client/server market where servers will have more control of the client machine. 
Yet, to fight it legally and win will wipe away many of its own patent claims and future filings in this critical market area and others. 
One thing is for sure, Gates can not remove "remote client component activation" concepts from its current software products or it any future system. 
This concept if key to the strategic future of Microsoft. 
How important this concept is to Microsoft can be seen in their heavy involvement in defining and molding the nation's interstate commence laws in 
regards to computer/software sales; More specifically, UCITA, formerly known 
as Article 2B. 
Still pending are the highly debated changes and amendments to UTICA. 
UTICA defines the amendments to the nations' interstate commerce laws for consumer computer and software products. 
It is being contested by a wide range of groups in the industry. 
Among the biggest groups are funded by Ralph Nader. 
This groups are fighting the relaxation of the many laws that 
exist today for consumers, and to stop any further erosion of computer privacy . 
In UCITA, one of the most fundamental changes to the law would allow Microsoft and others to "freely" enter the domain of a client machine automatically and without authorization. 
Coupled with this, is another change to the laws which attempts to make the "I AGREE" button legally binding across all states. 
Currently it is state by state. 
The agree button will give Microsoft full authorization to enter your computer. 
It is not a coincidence that the recent virus problems have reinstated new industry talk (started by Microsoft of course) of allowing Microsoft to automatically update end-user computers all in the name of "security." 
Microsoft wants this to happen, not just for security, but to pre-empt the UTICA opponents fighting the changes. 
Currently, it is illegal for Microsoft 
(anyone) to enter your computer. 
UCITA attempts to change this using an existing practice analogy of the Bank Repossession man going into your private property to remove your car due to lack of payment. 
The proponents of UTICA contend they have the same right to repossess copyrighted material or to stop the user from using unlicensed or expired licensed or pirated material automatically by zapping your computer. 
Future client/server systems, such as Web services will rekindle an old concept called "Time Sharing." 
The need to enter the client machine is a fundamental requirement. 
This new direction is only possible if a remote hosting server has full control to: a) Sending components to the client machine, 
b) Automatic activation of the components on the client machine, and c) also have the ability to automatically remove or turn off the components 
on the client machine. 
The idea of course with item C is to control the licensing of remote client 
software, especially for users who don't pay their "monthly subscription bills." 
Scary? 
Whether Microsoft intentions are as I described, they are certainly not going to tell us one way or another. 
But I've been involved in the design and automation of remote client/server systems for nearly 25+ years now and 
it doesn't take much for me to see this direction. 
I'm knee deep in it. 
Do the research yourself and you will see it all as well. 
This is a BIG STAKE! 
It is a GOLD! 
The lawyers and lobbyists pushing UTICA 
for Microsoft are considered one of the largest groups of lobbyists for any 
industry. 
If Eolas wins the appeal, the future of thin/slim clients are in the hands of Eolas. 
Similar to how Gates got IBM to give him a few points on each sale of DOS, considered one of the most fundamental business 
mistakes in IBM's history, Gates does not want Mr. Doyle doing to same to him in this important future client/server market.

Ha! I'm not crazy after all! 
Check this out September 1 article I just found regarding UCITA and this one about the "Remote Disabling of Software": The Eolas PATENT will control DEVELOPERS who want to control the automatic installation, activation, interactive usage and/or licensing of client-side applets using UTICA was a legal means to do so. 
On a positive note, this is further indication of "prior art." 
As Ed Foster, the author the article, notes in his article, as the most informative journalist on the subject, Article 2B as been in debate the early 1990s. 
The idea of "remote client software" control concepts has been in use and the minds of many in the industry. 
Please note in first article the listed group UCITA supporters does not include Microsoft. 
The truth is most of the groups, especially BSA is supported and funded by Microsoft. 
BSA is just a political lobby front for Microsoft.
