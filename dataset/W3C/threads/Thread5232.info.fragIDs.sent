<s> Bert Bos wrote some comments on the requirements...  </s>
<s> 2 Have a valid XML representation Apart from the fact that this contradicts the first requirement ("simple and easy"), I think that limiting the syntax up front is not very useful.  </s>
<s> Especially so, because of the timed-text formats (and proposed formats) that I have seen so far, those that were not based on XML were by far the most elegant.  </s>
<s> (E.g, those of Quicktime and Mplayer.)  </s>
<s> Have to agree - an XML representation might bring advantages - but it should  </s>
<s> not be a pre-requisite.  </s>
<s> Would it be possible to have an XML representation  </s>
<s> (with external documents?) that has a streamable format that is more efficient and elegant than its XML representation?  </s>
<s> 8 Allow the language of the text to be identified using xml:lang A corollary of the previous comment.  </s>
<s> The language should indeed be identified somehow, but it could be by other means than XML.  </s>
<s> Indeed, it could be outside the document itself, e.g., in an HTTP header.  </s>
<s> If the representation is XML - then XML should be fully utilised - but TT should IMHO support multiple language streams.  </s>
<s> 11 Have a default UNICODE font Is it really a requirement to have a standard font?  </s>
<s> What font would that be?  </s>
<s> Arial?  </s>
<s> Maybe the intention was to require that the format supports all Unicode characters, rather than a specific font?  </s>
<s> Somewhere in the charter it says that font is something to be left out of TT. TT should require support for Unicode **characters**.  </s>
<s> 18 Allow motion [...] I think this requirements makes the format too complicated and makes it approach SMIL and SVG too much.  </s>
<s> Those formats already exist.  </s>
<s> What's needed here is something simple, as requirement 1 says.  </s>
<s> Could motion be part of the style rather than the text?  </s>
<s> 19 Use SVG, MathML, XHTML or other language for complex font displays I agree with this requirement as such (as I said in the previous comment), but its appearance here seem to suggest something more, viz., that UAs that support timed text also have to support SVG, MathML and XHTML.  </s>
<s> That seems rather pointless to me.  </s>
<s> If the UA already supports those three, then there is no need anymore for timed text.  </s>
<s> I thought the purpose of timed text was precisely to have something that is simpler than those formats and still does the job in 95% of the cases.  </s>
<s> Absolutely, though it would be nice to be able to transfer glyphs that have no unicode representation by some mechanism within TT (e.g. trademarks and logos).  </s>
<s> Could this be by private data inclusion?  </s>
<s> Reference to external streams?  </s>
<s> 22 Adopt SMIL 2.0 as a base language.  </s>
<s> Like requirement 2 ("XML"), this puts too many a priori restrictions on the format.  </s>
<s> Besides, unless you subset SMIL so much that it doesn't look like SMIL anymore, it would not be simple and easy, as required by requirement 1.  </s>
<s> AFAIK SMIL also doesn't allow the implementation of all of the buffering and timing models (outlined by Glenn A. Adams) that are probably required.  </s>

<s> Hi - comments inline :  </s>
<s> 2 Have a valid XML representation  </s>
<s> External namespace support should be mandated.  </s>
<s> BTW, SMIL2 supports this, so that for example display extensions can be loaded by SMIL viewers (though currently only real player has a useful implementation of this).  </s>
<s> (Search down for "RealNetworks Extension Namespace")  </s>
<s> ??? Can you explain this more John - I don't get what you just said :-) The reduced format would be derivable from the XML format by using XSL to transform the document into whatever format was requested by the client.  </s>
<s> 8 Allow the language of the text to be identified using xml:lang  </s>
<s> But not *require* them I would have thought.  </s>
<s> 11 Have a default UNICODE font Is it really a requirement to have a standard font?  </s>
<s> What font would that be?  </s>
<s> Arial?  </s>
<s> Maybe the intention was to require that the format supports all Unicode characters, rather than a specific font?  </s>
<s> This is a function of the encoding used in XML documents, and is specified in the document declaration on the 1st line of conforming XML documents.  </s>
<s> *All* display attributes should be external to the document IMO.  </s>
<s> This could do with including positioning (% of display height and width for example) for open caption devices.  </s>
<s> All of this sort of thing can be specified in css by linking the stylesheet to the document.  </s>
<s> I think theres a data: url scheme which might work for some small snippets.  </s>
<s> Anybody got other ideas ?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Neil Smith.  </s>
<s> Regarding a point below about separation of style information.  </s>
<s> This may present a problem for use in a streamable format.  </s>
<s> In particular, this may cause every "access unit" to be accompanied by a style sheet.  </s>
<s> Some consideration needs to be given to this problem.  </s>
<s> Regards, G.  </s>
<s> Going beyond style, this applies to all dependencies (style, animations, references, etc).  </s>
<s> There's a variety of ways in which this can be solved or at least simplified, most of which boil down to the way in which you structure your documents.  </s>
<s> This is very likely an area in which TT and SVG should compare notes.  </s>

<s> TT must be XML-based for many reasons, among them (1) tools support, (2) API support, (3) easy transformation to arbitrary formats using XSL, (4) integration with other XML applications, etc.  </s>
<s> From where I sit SMIL would be a good reference to use while defining TT.  </s>
<s> It sounds like familiar with SMIL, so can you be more specific?  </s>
