On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question. 
A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to retaining the prohibition. 
C.3 should XML retain or relax SGML's prohibition on ENTITY attributes referring to SGML text entities (7.9.4.3)? 
Why should we retain it, it's an arbitrary restriction that requires extra code and can't be justified as adding any advantage to XML. relax. 
(I know I should).
