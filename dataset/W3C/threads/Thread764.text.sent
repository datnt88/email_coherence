Announcing http://check.theinfo.org/ 
With the increasing complex maze of formats and systems, we often forget to make sure that our files follow appropriate standards. 
This site will attempt to provide services to allow you to validate your files and insure that they are compatible with other systems. 
Basically what I've done is built simple Web interfaces to some command line programs. 
Right now you can run your XML files through xmllint and your HTML files through HTML Tidy. 
Suggestions and comments are appreciated. 
I'm willing to add new features if people are interested. 
I plan on adding RDF and RSS validation soon. 
Direct links: Enjoy!
