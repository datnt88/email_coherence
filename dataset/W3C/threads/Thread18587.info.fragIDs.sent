<s> Reply to: RE draft guideline Just a couple comments about Al's document:  </s>
<s> I agree strongly that all images should have a text description of some kind, be it separate or located on the same page.  </s>
<s> However, I think there are two categories of descriptions which should be considered: objective and critical (or interpretive).  </s>
<s> Objective descriptions simply provide information about what's happening in the image; they let the user provide his or her own interpretation.  </s>
<s> They are similar to audio descriptions used in movies and television programs.  </s>
<s> Critical or interpretive descriptions, on the other hand, can be used to provide either subjective opinion, where appropriate, *or* interpretive analysis which may not be immediately deduced from an objective description.  </s>
<s> One need not exclude the other: a chart or graph may require an interpretive description in addition to an objective one.  </s>
<s> I would think that, in most cases, an objective description would do the trick.  </s>
<s> However, I think these two types of descriptions should be kept separate.  </s>
<s> In other words, is it possible that some images will require two descriptions?  </s>
<s> Al, in your recommendations you state that links from from a description page back to an image should not be used.  </s>
<s> I've always thought that a "return" link from a description back to its image was a useful navigational aid.  </s>
<s> I also think that, in the case of an image map or other selectable image, a description which provides text links corresponding to the graphic links is a good idea.  </s>
<s> Am I misunderstanding your point?  </s>
<s> Can you elaborate?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> The (R2/2) indicates the second of two replies to follow up on what Geoff Freed said:  </s>
<s> ... I would demur on the "all."  </s>
<s> I hope we can articulate priorities for which images really need descriptions, because I don't think we're going to get all.  </s>
<s> I agree that this distinction is useful.  </s>
<s> I tried to say that description is required and interpretation is OK.  </s>
<s> I agree that the description and interpretation should ideally be presented in a way such that the visitor can tell the difference.  </s>
<s> A good writer will communicate this distinction using natural language cues.  </s>
<s> What kind of a "keep it separate" rule would you envision?  </s>
<s> So far I am not coming up with anything that looks like a real winner.  </s>
<s> In terms of what works now, you have to look at what Jamal Mazrui is doing to take multi-file web documents and make them available as single-file text documents for blind people.  </s>
<s> The offline use of the screen-reader is their analog to our dumping things to the printer.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that yet more separate files would deliver a net usability benefit in the end.  </s>
<s> One of the issues that I realized is floating in my mind on this objective/subjective issue is the question of who is doing the describing.  </s>
<s> NCAM and RFB&amp;D have been in the situation of furnishing descriptions as a third party.  </s>
<s> These groups have developed a "just the facts" ethic to a high level because they are systematically providing third-party transcriptions in a lot of cases.  </s>
<s> One of the great things about the WWW is the way it often eliminates the middle-man.  </s>
<s> If we can get to the authors of the Web content, we have a first-party description situation.  </s>
<s> Here the approach can be much more free to "articulate your message" and is not limited to the "just the facts" domain of the third-party intermediary.  </s>
<s> I hope this notion of first-party speech vs. third-party transcription will help communicate why I don't think that the best practice from NCAM and RFB&amp;D experience translates directly into recommended practice for web authors.  </s>
<s> Guidelines requiring objectivity are natural for third-party transcription.  </s>
<s> I think they are problematical for first-party annotation.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Reply to: RE  draft guideline (R1/2) I get it-- if the same image is used on several pages, one single description at one single location will suffice.  </s>
<s> If you're linking to this single description from multiple paths, the "return" link isn't such a good idea.  </s>
<s> Your idea of "use your browser's 'back' function..." is good.  </s>

<s> I think the use of server-side image maps should be strongly discouraged in favour of client-side maps, which have been officially available since the release of HTML 3.2.  </s>
<s> The above solution is appropriate to server-side image maps and may perhaps be offered in guidelines as an alternative, but I think the most important message which should be communicated to authors is that for the benefit of accessibility, they need to make use of client-side image maps with proper ALT attributes.  </s>
<s> In fact, if I remember rightly, the ALT attribute is required in the elements that designate the regions of a client-side image map.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Jason White said:  </s>
<s> Here is the situation the way I understand it, based entirely on unverified rumors and inferences: Authors and WebMasters would not presently use a user-side map without a server-side map because not enough browsers have implemented the user-side map feature.  </s>
<s> The auxiliary text navigation page that Geoff suggested is usable with a server-side map processing, or with user-side map processing.  </s>
<s> The need for this page is way less if you have a good USEMAP with well-written ALT entries.  </s>
<s> But its presence is no problem for the use of the USEMAP as well.  </s>
<s> The only difference is that if everyone were using USEMAP already, the recommended way of linking to an image description would not be by the default but by a dedicated region (perhaps including 0,0 ) with ALT="text description of the image".  </s>
<s> I haven't reviewed the structure of the USEMAP element to see how discursive one can get in wrapping the links in text.  </s>
<s> Sometimes it takes more than just a list with ALT text in the links to convey the graph created in the image, as for example: "The cabinet departments are arrayed around the White House in a circle to emphasize their equality of rank, as Arthur sat his Knights at a round table so none would fight over seats.  </s>
<s> In alphabetical order, they are list of links " The reason I didn't rely on USEMAP in my writeup is that I had internalized the assumption that it is so poorly supported by browsers in the field now that authors cannot use it except redundantly on top of server-side image map support.  </s>
<s> This, as I said earlier, is based entirely on unscientific methods of data collection and analysis and it would be helpful to know more about how thorough or spotty the implementation of USEMAP is among browsers in the field now.  </s>
<s> The whole issue of USEMAP vs. Yet Another HTML Page as the text-usable navigation bridge for a sensitive map merits further consideration.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> I agree that a long description of an image map may in some cases be necessary if the required information can not be conveyed by associating an ALT attribute with each of the defined areas on a client-side map.  </s>
<s> All web clients that comply with the HTML 3.2 specification should fully support client-side image maps.  </s>
<s> Any failure in this regard should certainly be addressed in the education and awareness aspect of the WAI project.  </s>
<s> Again, this is a "time frame" issue.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the guidelines should, in the first place, strongly discourage the use of server-side image maps, and then offer a solution for those who still insist upon using them.  </s>
<s> I agree, and wonder how close we are with the text included in the Trace unified guidelines at:  </s>
<s> I just a got a mail from Mike Paciello forwarding a request from Jamal to get HTML4 as one single text document.  </s>
<s> As I said in my answer, before doing the HTML to text translation, a single HTML document must be created from all the little documents that make up the specs today.  </s>
<s> A simple concat will not do it since the multiple HEAD/BODY would create parsing problems.  </s>
<s> So a script must be written than does just that, in the order of the TOC probably.  </s>
<s> Any summer programmer available ?  </s>
<s> (if not, I'll try to get someone to do it at W3C, but our resource are scarce in this area).  </s>
<s> Al again:  </s>
<s> Funny you mention this third-party description since (and I'm not sure I mentioned it to this forum already) this is also something I thought about for regular ALT (out of the objective/subjective focus) a while ago.  </s>
<s> The idea would be for some organizations to maintain an "ALT description server", or AltServ, and for users looking for ALT text to go ask this server if the description in the source is not present (or useless).  </s>
<s> Sighted users willing to help could fill in the database (one database entry: URL of image, ALT text) when they browse the web and hit IMG with no ALT (in the source or in the database).  </s>
<s> Different ways to fill the database could be via an email procedure, or some Web form.  </s>
<s> AltServ-aware browsers would automatically fetch the ALT text from the server (or its closest mirror) when no ALT attrib is available: it's transparent for the end-user.  </s>
<s> If there is no ALT in the database, one could imagine an additional service where the images with the most no-ALT "hit" could get prioritized and "ALTed" first by the sighted friend circle.  </s>
<s> Anyway.  </s>
<s> I didn't exactly invent this architecture: this is pretty close to a third party PICS rating system where the PICS label is the ALT description.  </s>
<s> The biggest non-technical drawback I see is that it doesn't encourage self-ALT-description, which is probably the best in the long term.  </s>
<s> Thank you for the reference.  </s>
<s> The Trace recommendations on this point are excellent, and I fully support the policy of emphasising client-side image maps as the preferred approach.  </s>
<s> The only change that I would suggest, taking up one of Al's earlier comments, is that in some cases it may be important to provide a link to an over-all description of the image as well as ALT text for each of the active areas.  </s>
<s> For instance, in the example provided in the guidelines concerning the image of a motorcycle, it would be helpful to have a general description of the vehicle as well as ALT text associated with each link.  </s>
<s> This would seem to be the same issue as D-tag or LONGDESC Yes?  </s>
