As I was preparing the recently posted "visual model" of the WebDAV protocol, it occurred to me that a more consistent name for a "baseline selector" would be a "version-controlled configuration" (since that is what it actually is). 
So I propose that we get rid of the last remnant of the old "selector" terminology, and use "version-controlled configuration" instead. 
Any objections? 
Cheers, Geoff
