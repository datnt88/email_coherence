Normally just sending the URL server should do the trick. 
But what I expect is that the site needs to set some cookies that are found on the homepage http://bohl.minot.com 
Dear Clement Onime, I suspect that the site checks the HTTP Referer field. 
If this was the case, the problem could actually be solved if www4mail provided the possibility for the user to specify a Referer in his request and would hand over the given Referer to the web site in its HTTP request. 
A simplified cure could be that www4mail always specified as Referer the dirname of the requested URL. 
Saluton!

Well, 
Yes, I must say this is a possiblity that escaped me. the HTTP_REFERER. 
Well, I think that the immediate solution would be to talk to the web master of the site. 
For now we would list it as one of those categories of sites that www4mail cannot access. 
Thanks

I agree that the best thing to do is talk to the webmaster rather than make up fictitious values for the referrer field. 
Making up false values, such as the dirname, could confuse webmasters.
