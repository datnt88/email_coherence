<s> My understanding is that the term "user agent" has a precise meaning, at least within the HTML and CSS specifications.  </s>
<s> It refers to any software that processes HTML and CSS respectively.  </s>
<s> This would include braille or speech-based web browsers, but exclude conventional screen readers.  </s>
<s> However, software which accepts data from a browser via DOM and processes the markup and style sheets in order to generate an appropriate braille or audio rendering, might well be considered a user agent.  </s>
<s> The page author guidelines are aimed at both end users who create web content and at developers of authoring tools, file conversion software, etc., which generate documents to be delivered via the Web.  </s>
<s> if we named it "user interface guidelines" where would be put the info about how the browsers or user agents should deal with html etc. there are more than interface issues that we want browser mfgrs to talk address.  </s>
<s> g At the risk of further complicating the nomenclature debate, I would like to suggest "user interface guidelines" instead of either "user agent" or "client software" guidelines.  </s>
<s> This title at least emphasises the nature of the subject matter.  </s>
<s> Specific issues relevant to the user interface of HTML editing software and similar products would be treated in the authoring tool guidelines, however.  </s>
<s> The user interface guidelines themselves would still provide basic parameters, but concentrate more on client software, including both user agents and assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a compromised title such as "WAI client software user interface guidelines" would be best.  </s>
<s> The treatment of HTML by user agents is for the most part regulated by the HTML specification itself.  </s>
<s> The guidelines would only need to emphasise the importance of compliance.  </s>
<s> Moreover, is it not the case that we only want to influence the user agent's handling of HTML in so far as it affects the manner in which the document will be presented to the user, which is a function of the user interface?  </s>
<s> The guidelines prepared by the UI group will have several functions, but I think it would be a mistake to limit them only to client software, browsers, user agents or whatever synonymous term is chosen.  </s>
<s> Perhaps they could be called "user interface and browser design guidelines".  </s>
<s> This would be a reflection of the fact that many of the recommendations would apply to web-based software generally, including authoring tools, and that as well as including directions specific to browsers, the guidelines discuss general user interface considerations to which reference can then be made in other documents, such as the authoring tool guidelines.  </s>
<s> Thus, the UI group would be largely responsible for addressing issues of user interface design; the AU group would consider these questions to the extent to which there are special aspects of the user interface that are specific to authoring software.  </s>
<s> Since the title is the first element of a document which is encountered by a reader, it is important that it be brief and at the same time capture the essence of the document's substantive content.  </s>
