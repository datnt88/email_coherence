<s> I joined this list recently, so please be gentle with me if this is a topic that was already discussed here.  </s>
<s> Non-text illustrations (particularly in instruction manuals, or on web pages that deliver the user interface of a hardware, software, or service system) often contain many details that are not relevant to the task at hand.  </s>
<s> This irrelevant content will distract or disable some users, and will slow down, to the point of interfering with productivity, many more.  </s>
<s> I remember (from my days at Bell Labs) a documentation guideline to use line drawings, with relevant information only, rather than photographs (which tend to include irrelevant detail) as illustrations in technical manuals.  </s>
<s> Two questions: 1.  </s>
<s> Is minimizing irrelevant detail something that should be explicitly included in the (upper case G) Guidelines?  </s>
<s> 2. Is this a valid concern with respect to checkpoint instructions?  </s>
<s> For example, should one be concerned that the "all" in "a text equivalent for _all_ non-text content" will lead developers to include irrelevant elements of illustrations in the replacement text?  </s>

<s> Context matters.  </s>
<s> Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.  </s>
<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if we need a Compendium of Useful Suggestions in addition to our Capital-G Guidelines.  </s>
<s> There are a number of things which blur the lines between "access" and "usability" and don't fit well into our model of checkpoints, priorities, and so on -- but which are still valid concepts which don't deserve to be forgotten about merely because they don't fit into the framework which we've constructed.  </s>
<s> I feel that this is an important principle.  </s>
<s> But I feel it's also very difficult to codify into a unified, general guideline, let alone a yes/no checkpoint.  </s>
<s> There are a number of other such "good things to do" which, if part of the general "mindset" while creating a page, will lead to more usable/accessible web sites, but which strictly speaking are not binary checkpoints.  </s>
<s> I would hate to have them get lost.  </s>
<s> It's possible.  </s>
<s> Our yes/no approach to checkpoints means that "do a sufficient amount" style requirements must be carefully written and the supporting material must explain exactly what is meant.  </s>
<s> If we provide good examples, we can minimize the possibilities of confusion.  </s>
<s> Also, we may be able to reduce the damage done by promoting both the use of "replacement" and "descriptive" text equivalents.  </s>
<s> ALT vs. LONGDESC -- I'm not sure if anyone feels that you can have "too much longdesc"?  </s>

<s> Excellent point!  </s>
<s> After we specify that illustrations should be there, we can tackle helping authors determine how to do it well ... Anne  </s>
