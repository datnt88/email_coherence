Hi, I am interested in Tidy and I think the validation of a HTML document and converting it to a XHTML document isn't?the final intention of Tidy. 
What is the development plan of Tidy? 
Regards, zuoli Tidy is not a validator, but unlike a validator, Tidy aims to fix up errors in HTML documents. 
Tidy is useful in dealing with machine generated or hand edited markup. 
At some point the development of Tidy will stop as the number of bugs/enhancement requests dies down.

To wit: "pressing tasks such as ... further work on HTML at W3C." And I thought HTML had ceased to progress and we could go on to XHTML and XML applications.
