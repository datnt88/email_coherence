<s> Hello, I did some research in preparation for discussion at the face to face about the illustrating text checkpoint.  </s>
<s> In previous drafts it was checkpoint 3.4 "Supplement text with non-text content."  </s>
<s> In Gregg's latest proposal it is checkpoint 4.1.  </s>
<s> I prepared 2 sets of notes and referred to a 3rd set written in May 2001.  </s>
<s> These need more work but were used as part of Sunday afternoon's discussion at the F2F.  </s>
<s> [Minutes of this discussion are at: We had good discussion at the F2F and I need to incorporate that feedback into my notes.  </s>
<s> However, I published the minutes from the F2F today and I would like to publish the notes for those who were not able to attend.  </s>
<s> I will continue to work on my notes and I welcome any feedback.  </s>
<s> 1. Symbolic Languages instead of text-based language quick summary: what are the issues and how can we use technology to solve them?  </s>
<s> Many of these ideas look to the future.  </s>
<s> Still unanswered is what to do today.  </s>
<s> Gregg took an action at the F2F to draft a new checkpoint to address the issues brought up in the discussion.  </s>
<s> 2. Illustrating text quick summary: what are common uses of illustrations already in use on the web, what are some possible technological solutions, and what needs to be considered when creating illustrations?  </s>
<s> This is more of an outline of the things to consider than of solutions.  </s>
<s> It feels like a techniques document rather than success criteria for a checkpoint, but they are issues I thought would help us design success criteria.  </s>
<s> 3. Wendy's unillustrated notes, thoughts, and questions about the recent WCAG WG "Illustrating Guidelines" thread quick summary: In May 2001 I was trying to summarize an ongoing thread called "Illustrating Guidelines."  </s>
<s> In it I try to get my head around the issues by summarizing the axes of discussion and the main points of discussion.  </s>
<s> The axes of discussion are still relevant today.  </s>

<s> In the reference below you suggest that putting an originally unillustrated document online means you don't have to illustrate it.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> I don't think that there is any justification for suggesting that the original was accessible, and therefore there is no justification for suggesting that a version of it on the Web will be accessible.  </s>
<s> In order to make smomething accessible, it might be necessary to provide further information.  </s>
<s> (text equivalents for chart data are as much an example of this as visual illustrations of a set of instructions).  </s>
<s> There may be cases where the author decides that something should not be changed or added to in any way, for whatever reason.  </s>
<s> This decision has nothing to do with whether or not people can use the original content, and does not in any way render a checkpoint inapplicable.  </s>
<s> just my 2 cents worth.  </s>

<s> Agreed and in the F2F I talked about annotating original works and using Web services to create alternative versions (copyright would be dealt with properly).  </s>
<s> It didn't make it back into my notes, but I believe it is captured in the minutes of Sunday afternoon.  </s>
<s> For example, Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic make original works accessible by reading and recording them, other organizations translate books into Braille.  </s>
<s> Perhaps someone will create a web service that produces illustrated versions of original works.  </s>
<s> Or Cliff-Note like services that summarize.  </s>
<s> However, the point I was trying to make in my notes, is that it would not be *required* to illustrate previously published works that were not illustrated by the original author.  </s>

<s> In the sense that something requires illustration to be accessible, the question of whether or not the illustrations are provided by the original author is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> In order to make something accessible, it may well be *required* to illustrate it, even if the original author lacked the desire, or resources, or time, or format to do so.  </s>
<s> In the sense that WCAG has no enforcement power, of course nothing is required.  </s>
<s> There are just things that need to be done *IF* somebody wants to make content accessible, according to the WCAG conformance definition.  </s>
