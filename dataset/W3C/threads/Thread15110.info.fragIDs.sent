Hello, I did some research in preparation for discussion at the face to face about the illustrating text checkpoint. 
In previous drafts it was checkpoint 3.4 "Supplement text with non-text content." 
In Gregg's latest proposal it is checkpoint 4.1. 
I prepared 2 sets of notes and referred to a 3rd set written in May 2001. 
These need more work but were used as part of Sunday afternoon's discussion at the F2F. 
[Minutes of this discussion are at: We had good discussion at the F2F and I need to incorporate that feedback into my notes. 
However, I published the minutes from the F2F today and I would like to publish the notes for those who were not able to attend. 
I will continue to work on my notes and I welcome any feedback. 
1. Symbolic Languages instead of text-based language quick summary: what are the issues and how can we use technology to solve them? 
Many of these ideas look to the future. 
Still unanswered is what to do today. 
Gregg took an action at the F2F to draft a new checkpoint to address the issues brought up in the discussion. 
2. Illustrating text quick summary: what are common uses of illustrations already in use on the web, what are some possible technological solutions, and what needs to be considered when creating illustrations? 
This is more of an outline of the things to consider than of solutions. 
It feels like a techniques document rather than success criteria for a checkpoint, but they are issues I thought would help us design success criteria. 
3. Wendy's unillustrated notes, thoughts, and questions about the recent WCAG WG "Illustrating Guidelines" thread quick summary: In May 2001 I was trying to summarize an ongoing thread called "Illustrating Guidelines." 
In it I try to get my head around the issues by summarizing the axes of discussion and the main points of discussion. 
The axes of discussion are still relevant today.

In the reference below you suggest that putting an originally unillustrated document online means you don't have to illustrate it. 
I disagree. 
I don't think that there is any justification for suggesting that the original was accessible, and therefore there is no justification for suggesting that a version of it on the Web will be accessible. 
In order to make smomething accessible, it might be necessary to provide further information. 
(text equivalents for chart data are as much an example of this as visual illustrations of a set of instructions). 
There may be cases where the author decides that something should not be changed or added to in any way, for whatever reason. 
This decision has nothing to do with whether or not people can use the original content, and does not in any way render a checkpoint inapplicable. 
just my 2 cents worth.

Agreed and in the F2F I talked about annotating original works and using Web services to create alternative versions (copyright would be dealt with properly). 
It didn't make it back into my notes, but I believe it is captured in the minutes of Sunday afternoon. 
For example, Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic make original works accessible by reading and recording them, other organizations translate books into Braille. 
Perhaps someone will create a web service that produces illustrated versions of original works. 
Or Cliff-Note like services that summarize. 
However, the point I was trying to make in my notes, is that it would not be *required* to illustrate previously published works that were not illustrated by the original author.

In the sense that something requires illustration to be accessible, the question of whether or not the illustrations are provided by the original author is irrelevant. 
In order to make something accessible, it may well be *required* to illustrate it, even if the original author lacked the desire, or resources, or time, or format to do so. 
In the sense that WCAG has no enforcement power, of course nothing is required. 
There are just things that need to be done *IF* somebody wants to make content accessible, according to the WCAG conformance definition.
