First, it is worth noting that this is an issue recognised in the WCAG group, who are trying to determine (among the many other work items they have) what should be considered a minimum baseline for browsers - in terms of what capability users have. 
Further, it is not specifically older browsers that are "non-standard" - 
define "non-standard" 
But it is true that getting users to upgrade is in principle a very important way to get progress in accessibility. 
There are many difficulties involved - in the real world people generally do not update their systems frequently any more, sometimes for very good reasons. 
I have uploaded and am running the latest version of PINE in e-mail, and I think I have the latest version of LYNX for web browsing. 
now is this considered "upgrade" in your book or does it have to have all the fancy bells and whistles to be considered "updated" 
(As someone who is using a version of Mozilla that has been available for several months, rather than the new version with more accessibility features this applies to me too. 
And I make an effort to keep most of my tools up to dat - my Operating system was updated last week, and most of my browsers are the latest available version. 
There are also tools I would like to 
now how many people in the real world up date anything that frequently...how about someone running the latest (not avaliable in the USA) MSDOS 8.1 ?? What about someone who is running BSD, or Linux, or some other less popular browser??? 
I am playing devils advocate a bit but many people just "like" text, why is it so hard to understand this is a valid way to use the web and people who chose speed and robust and clearity over bells and whistles have a right to all of the data and information on the internet. 
While I do agree that an older browser causes accessibility issues, I feel that when standards are brought into the picture that older browsers should be considered non-standard and should be discouraged as much as possible. 
being considered "Non standard" and being "discouraged" is very different a basic level of usability MUST be preserved.. there are too many people in the third world and who are low income and who cannot or chose not to upgrade on a regular basis.

Further, it is not specifically older browsers that are "non-standard" - 
define "non-standard" In general, I mean "unable to do something sensible with all valid code" - for example a browser that can't give access to the URI specified by the cite attribute of a blockquote element is non-standard. 
(As far as I know this includes all browsers except iCab, and as far as I know there is not a single browser that manages to conform to HTML 4 and CSS 1 completely - although browsers are a lot better at it now than they were. 
I have uploaded and am running the latest version of PINE in e-mail, and I think I have the latest version of LYNX for web browsing. 
now is this considered "upgrade" in your book or does it have to have all the fancy bells and whistles to be considered "updated" Well, I too am running what I believe is the latest version of PINE for my 
email, and I use a fairly recent version of Lynx. 
There are a few things that 
Lynx does not do well, but it is obviously an upgrade - it handles most things better than older versions, and it handles most things.

My point is that most people do not upgrade frequently. 
In fact, people who are using a less common system are probably reasonably likely to either upgrade more frequently - in the case of iCab the browser forces you to do so, since it is a beta version and the developers don't want to have to support old betas longer than thye absolutely must - or not to upgrade at all - for example I know people who use AOLPress as an authoring tool, and will not change, but cannot upgrade because it hasn't been in development for the last 5 years.

Bob being considered "Non standard" and being "discouraged" is very different CMN I don't consider "no-frills" browsers older browsers, I consider outdated versions of those, and outdated versions of common browsers (Netscape 4.anything, IE 5 for windows, Opera 4, ...) older browsers. 
But I agree that they are almost always less standards-conformant than newer browsers, and should be discouraged. 
a basic level of usability MUST be preserved.. there are too many people in the third world and who are low income and who cannot or chose not to upgrade on a regular basis. 
Right. 
But where to define that level? 
ASCII text is no good for the three quarters of the world whose languages can't be written in it, and ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin 1, and an internationally recognised set of characters that Windows mostly copies in their system software for latin-alphabet countries) doesn't get a whole lot further. 
Text itself doesn't solve the communication problem for many people - I think it is no longer true that most people in the world cannot read, but it is not far from true. 
(but then half of the world have never made a telephone call, so we are really only talking about the priveliged minority anyway when we consider access to the web of today in international terms).

I also use Pine as well since it is fast and easy to use. 
I do not have any visual disabilities. 
However, I prefer to use Links (http://links.sourceforge.net/) 
for the text Web browser when I don't use a GUI Web browser. 
Have you guys used this browser before? 
I think it is 
a much better browser IMHO. 
[snip] 
I have to say I think Links is excellent. 
I haven't used it much, but it's the most standards-compliant browser I've ever seen. 
However Lynx will always have a place in a lot of people's hearts. 
I forgot to mention that Links does so well with tables and frames. 
It is amazing. 
:)

Browsers I use: Links, Lynx, iCab, Mozilla, Opera, Internet Explorer, Netscape, WannaBe, Amaya, MiniWeb, ICEbrowser, and Phone.com (and occasionally others). 
There is a page (slightly out of date, but noetheless useful for ideas) that the WAI Education and Outreach group has where they provide links to a number of different browsers, but not nearly all of them.

I have used Links quite often - it is *quite* amazing. 
However, it doesn't do to well on linearizing (nag, nag, nag ;) so for such I use Lynx which is still the all around best one, IMnsHO.

Tina, what do you mean by linearizing? 
Do you have an example? 
I believe that this: can explain it much better than I could. 
Links, basically, is far TOO good at laying out tables in a visual fashion. 
Lynx is not soo good, and this trait makes it invaluable in observing how a page functions with regard to checkpoint 5.3.

Ah thanks! 
That helped :).
