In lieu of my doing anything genuinely useful with circles, rectangles and arrows, I've posted a diagram of the 0.9 schema here : The picture was generated with Protege-2000 (my favourite toy at the moment) using the Ontoviz (Graphviz) plugin. 
The original layout was short and very wide but with the help of a little assistant I've rearranged it somewhat. 
Danny Ayers Neat! 
I already hacked up a simple view of the data model, linked to from:- but it hasn't got anywhere near as much detail as your version. 
Would you mind if I linked to your version from this model page? 
Is there an SVG version of it somewhere as well? 
Thanks again for this, Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

it makes the relationships clear! 
nice work. 
I particularly like the furry animal representing the open issue w/dates (at least that's what i'm assuming...) If you've used Graphviz, isn't that the product from AT&amp;T that can generate SVG? 
If so, I agree Sean, link to it, particularly if we have it as both a gif and svg. 
right on.

In some cases the assertor will not be a person at all. 
For example, the CSS validator might run around W3C's web site every week checking if things are valid, and making EARl assertions about those that are not. 
Chaals Neat!

We can't get too much of this stuff folks.

Danny Ayers Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Of course: that's why "Person" is a *sub* class of "Assertor", not daml:sameClassAs. 
From the 0.9 N3 schema [1]:- earl:Person a rdfs:Class; rdfs:subClassOf earl:Assertor . 
Has this not come across in the graph somewhere? 
Hmm... is says "Person isA Assertor", which I guess means that all instances of person are also instances of Assertor. 
While that's correct, it should be noted that this isn't the only sub class allowed. 
The whole point of rdfs:subClassOf is that as well as being a transitive property (as indicated in the graph), it's also a refining mechanism - it allows you to specialize super classes.

like the graph but think it could be made even simpler (like: why repeating the "hasName, hasPlatform, etc" in the box *and* as label for arrows ?). would be good also to have something linking the 2 "pieces" together. 
good point - what purpose does the 'Person' class serve apart from providing the email address? 
could this be provided by the Address class, dropping 'Person' altogether? 
Though if the Assertor is a person, then another word is probably needed for 'Platform' or just have value : Windows/Linux/Flesh ;-) Danny Ayers Ignore my previous comment about dropping Person - Sean's perfectly right here, I was also misreading the diagram...
