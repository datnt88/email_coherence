Hello, In the 11 April 2001 draft [1] of UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 4.6 reads: 4.6 For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in the viewport. 
Allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions available to the author (e.g., the range of positions allowed by the markup or style language). 
Based on discussion and resolutions at the 19 April 2001 teleconference [2], I am trying to clarify the checkpoint. 
The fully revised checkpoint is at the end of this email. 
Things to take into account: 0) This checkpoint is about control of captions position with respect to one or more synchronized visual tracks (and not just any other piece of content). 
This checkpoint is for graphical viewports only. 
1) This checkpoint should only be about synchronized text tracks, not [collated] text transcripts. 
I think the whole point of this checkpoint is to ensure that synchronized information is both legible and nearby. 
I think that in general, authors will specify captions to accompany a visual track (in the same viewport), but not transcripts. 
Proposed: Drop text transcripts and collated text transcripts from this checkpoint. 
Note that checkpoint 2.5 also refers to [collated] text transcripts and should continue to do so: this ensures that they are available at the same time as a visual track. 
2) Respect the author's positions and styles (e.g., colors, etc.) as expressed in the content. 
However, allow the user to override the author's specified position. 
4) The user agent is not required to lay out other content (i.e., reflow) after the user has changed the position of captions. 
5) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup language or style sheet language for control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions enabled by the format. 
6) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint otherwise (e.g., by making available captions in a separate viewport), then the user agent must: a) Allow the user to position the captions to overlap the visual track. 
The captions background should be transparent to allow the visual track to show through. 
b) Allow the user to position the captions to not overlap the visual track. 
7) The checkpoint should allow for configuration or control. 
Given all of this: For graphical viewports, allow the user to position captions with respect to synchronized visual tracks as follows: If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup language or style sheet language to provide configuration or control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions enabled by the format. 
Otherwise, the user agent must allow both non-overlapping and overlapping positions (e.g., by rendering captions in a separate viewport that may be positioned on top of the visual track). 
The user agent must allow the user to override the author's specified position. 
The user agent is not required to change the layout of other content (i.e., reflow) after the user has changed the position of captions. 
Note: When captions overlap the synchronized visual track, the user should be able to view the visual track behind the captions. 
Refer to checkpoint 4.3 for requirements related to the control of background colors.

Sound reasonable.

2) Respect the author's positions and styles (e.g., colors, etc.) as expressed in the content. 
However, allow the user to override the author's specified position. 
[DA: If we allow override of the author's position, we also need to allow override of style. 
You can make text just as impossible to read by choosing a style that is not perceptible to an individual as by choosing a position that makes life difficult.] 
4) The user agent is not required to lay out other content (i.e., reflow) after the user has changed the position of captions. 
5) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup language or style sheet language for control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions enabled by the format. 
6) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint otherwise (e.g., by making available captions in a separate viewport), then the user agent must: a) Allow the user to position the captions to overlap the visual track. 
The captions background should be transparent to allow the visual track to show through. 
[This capability might bite a user. 
If the captions have a transparent background, there will be times where the captions and the background form a color combination that cannot be seen. 
As an option, this might be OK, but you would also want the option of having a fixed background color for the captions, so that they are always readable, regardless of the visual track changes.] 
b) Allow the user to position the captions to not overlap the visual track. 
7) The checkpoint should allow for configuration or control. 
Given all of this: For graphical viewports, allow the user to position captions with respect to synchronized visual tracks as follows: If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup language or style sheet language to provide configuration or control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions enabled by the format.
