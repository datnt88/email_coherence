<s> Hello, In the 11 April 2001 draft [1] of UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 4.6 reads: 4.6 For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in the viewport.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions available to the author (e.g., the range of positions allowed by the markup or style language).  </s>

<s> Things to take into account: 0) This checkpoint is about control of captions position with respect to one or more synchronized visual tracks (and not just any other piece of content).  </s>
<s> This checkpoint is for graphical viewports only.  </s>
<s> 1) This checkpoint should only be about synchronized text tracks, not [collated] text transcripts.  </s>

<s> Proposed: Drop text transcripts and collated text transcripts from this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Note that checkpoint 2.5 also refers to [collated] text transcripts and should continue to do so: this ensures that they are available at the same time as a visual track.  </s>

<s> 5) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup language or style sheet language for control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of positions enabled by the format.  </s>
<s> 6) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint otherwise (e.g., by making available captions in a separate viewport), then the user agent must: a) Allow the user to position the captions to overlap the visual track.  </s>
<s> The captions background should be transparent to allow the visual track to show through.  </s>
<s> b) Allow the user to position the captions to not overlap the visual track.  </s>
