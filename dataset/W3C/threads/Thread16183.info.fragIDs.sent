<s> Though it is largely aimed at Web Accessability their is a large base of users knowlegable of these devices and their use.  </s>
<s> Let me know, Lake Roca  </s>
<s> Does anyone out there in U-test land have any experience with screen readers for visually impaired users.  </s>
<s> I've just started researching this topic.  </s>
<s> The Microsoft site provides a list of accessibility products for use with Windows 95 and NT which seems like a very good place to start,  </s>
<s> but  </s>
<s> if anyone has any experience in this area, I'd love to hear it.  </s>
<s> We are looking to deliver a system in March to two locations.  </s>
<s> In our Florida location there is a sight-impaired user.  </s>
<s> With the current mainframe/dumb terminal system, he uses a system that reads the contents  </s>
<s> of  </s>
<s> the screen to him through one side of his headphones while he works with  </s>
<s> a  </s>
<s> caller on the other side.  </s>
<s> I don't know much about it yet, other than his current screen reader won't work with our new client/server system and  </s>
<s> that  </s>
<s> the voice he hears is that of someone who recorded the contents of each  </s>
<s> of  </s>
<s> the screens.  </s>
<s> I'd like for the new system to work similar to the old one  </s>
<s> if  </s>

<s> Hi Larry, I received your request for assistance via the list that Lake  </s>
<s> mentioned.  </s>
<s> I may be able to assist.  </s>
<s> I am a blind individual who has  </s>
<s> been using and working with screenreaders for several years.  </s>
<s> If I can answer questions for you, I'd be happy to do so.  </s>
<s> I noticed you mentioned a new system.  </s>
<s> what are you working with?  </s>
<s> most screen reading software available today can directly voice windows 3.x and 9.x systems and a couple work with nt.  </s>
<s> unix even has some stuff but the x-windows stuff is not quite there yet.  </s>
<s> I use Jaws for windows with all flavors of windows and have used the mac  </s>
<s> as well.  </s>
<s> I train and otherwise work with several of the screen readers also.  </s>
<s> Please let me know how I can help.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> There is a mailing list for blind linux users which is a good place to find screen reading programs for linux.  </s>
<s> THere are a number of them around - svlpro, ultrasonix, screader are the ones that spring immediately to my memory.  </s>
<s> If anyone is interested I will dig out the URI for the list archive.  </s>
