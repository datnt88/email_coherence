Hello every one, 
A colleague of mine is looking for information on screen readers and client 
server systems. 
Is there any one out there willing to help?

Lake, Please feel free to forward my note to the mail list you mentioned. 
I thank you for taking the time to respond and offering to send this on to the mail list. 
Larry lake@netscape.com (Lakespur Roca) Tuesday January 12, 1999 06:25 PM cc: (bcc: Larry Fix/PSC/Pru) Subject: Re: screen readers for visually impaired users With your permission I could forward your request to a mail list that discusses accessability. 
Though it is largely aimed at Web Accessability their is a large base of users knowlegable of these devices and their use. 
Let me know, Lake Roca 
Does anyone out there in U-test land have any experience with screen readers for visually impaired users. 
I've just started researching this topic. 
The Microsoft site provides a list of accessibility products for use with Windows 95 and NT which seems like a very good place to start, 
but 
if anyone has any experience in this area, I'd love to hear it. 
We are looking to deliver a system in March to two locations. 
In our Florida location there is a sight-impaired user. 
With the current mainframe/dumb terminal system, he uses a system that reads the contents 
of 
the screen to him through one side of his headphones while he works with 
a 
caller on the other side. 
I don't know much about it yet, other than his current screen reader won't work with our new client/server system and 
that 
the voice he hears is that of someone who recorded the contents of each 
of 
the screens. 
I'd like for the new system to work similar to the old one 
if 
possible. 
Any ideas? 
Yours in usability, Larry Fix 
Hi Larry, I received your request for assistance via the list that Lake 
mentioned. 
I may be able to assist. 
I am a blind individual who has 
been using and working with screenreaders for several years. 
If I can answer questions for you, I'd be happy to do so. 
I noticed you mentioned a new system. 
what are you working with? 
most screen reading software available today can directly voice windows 3.x and 9.x systems and a couple work with nt. 
unix even has some stuff but the x-windows stuff is not quite there yet. 
I use Jaws for windows with all flavors of windows and have used the mac 
as well. 
I train and otherwise work with several of the screen readers also. 
Please let me know how I can help. 
Thanks!

There is a mailing list for blind linux users which is a good place to find screen reading programs for linux. 
THere are a number of them around - svlpro, ultrasonix, screader are the ones that spring immediately to my memory. 
If anyone is interested I will dig out the URI for the list archive.
