Microsoft's 16 July 1998 SBN Wire (Site Builder Network) includes hints on creating confirmation boxes (ok/cancel pop-ups). 
Do pop-up boxes create accessibility problems, and if so are there recommended alternatives? 
Along the same lines, what about the growing number of links that open a new browser window when you click on them, or the ads that pop up in new windows with no warning? 
Many of the ads pop up at a specific size, and have all of the standard browser navigation buttons hidden (in netscape at least). 
Does this present any special accessibility problems? 
How important are the browser's standard navigational controls to accessibility?

they're all a pain in the neck. 
I have to close the darn window because it is useless to me.

Thanks, David. 
Any chance I could get more specific info on the problems each condition creates? 
* Pop-up Confirmation boxes * Spawning new browser windows * Spawning specifically sized browser windows (e.g. 640 x 480) * Spawning browser windows without standard toolbars etc. 
Perhaps the answers seem obvious to people with more experience, but I'm still a beginner to all this and I'd like to understand the problems as much as possible.

I'm not even sure when those things happen. 
I just know that when there are no obvious textual ways to deal with what is on the screen, things go hay wire. 
for instanc, the wattermark of geocities opened in a ew window or at least I figured that is what happened because closing that window, gave me the site I was seeking. the window only said "here's a message from one of our sponsors. 
this is with jfw 3.2 and netscape 4.05. 
As I indicated I don't now what's going on behind the scenes. 
flashing text for instances causes problems for navigation because the navigation aids want to go to them, anything that pops up over the page will be useless and render the page useless because it will be jumbled. 
anything that has no directional text ellements in it and is off to the side will be missed entirely. 
this is a user looking at the display or trying to who doesn't know what the cause of the problems is. 
I guess if we had some specific examples saying go to this url for this behaviour etc, I could use my combination and throw in ie for good measure because I use it too and it is popular and good at getting at sites, and report back. 
I'd hope though that someone will tell us more specifically how these things naming names affect access.

When I am browsing your site with a palm-top (300x150 display) a 640x480 pop-up will annoy the hell out of me, in the same way as a 750x??? table with a message saying 'best viewed at 800x600' This is what, in the Guidelines, would be a priority 3 item - it doesn't make the site inaccessible as such, it just makes it annoying to use. 
(where priority 2 is the stuff is accessible, but presents major problems to some group(s) of users, and priority 1 means if you don't do this, some group CANNOT access your site) The relative font sizes thing I mentioned to Sue is similar. 
A slight difference is that people with low vision (for example me at the end of the day) may wish to set their base font size at 16 points. 
If you format a font to be 10 points, because that is smaller than the 12 points you used for your normal font, it makes my life difficult. 
If you format its size as 80% then it is a bit smaller than whatever I use as my standard.
