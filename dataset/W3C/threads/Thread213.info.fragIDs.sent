<s> Hi, I'm very concerned in accessible webdesign and therfore i'm trying to enhance pages for use with text mode browser like Lynx [1].  </s>
<s> Lynx does not create an empty line before PRE and therefore i got used to use P PRE ... to ensure this empty line.  </s>
<s> HTML Tidy now cuts all those important P tags off and i have to insert them again.  </s>
<s> Would be /nice/ if tidy lets them were they are, maybe with an option not to trimm an empty P. regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann [1] - URL:http://lynx.browser.org:80/  </s>

<s> Yes, i could use it, but so i have 2 very annoying empty lines in all other Browsers, since for P &amp;nbsp; /P something is rendered, for just p not.  </s>

<s> Here's my test file: $ cat t.html  </s>

<s> Test spacing  </s>
<s> This is test output is there any space?  </s>
<s> This is test 2 is there any space It looks to me like lynx puts in a space for p .  </s>
<s> Of course, I'm using Lynx version 2.8.3dev.6 .  </s>
<s> What version are you using?  </s>

<s> renders correctly but tidy would removes the empty P here that causes the empty line *and* this example is illegal HTML4.0 Strict.  </s>
<s> BTW: Tidy should correct this and put those Body text into a P or DIV.  </s>
<s> renders without an empty line.  </s>
<s> So i think there are no version diffs.  </s>
<s> 2.8.2rel.1 (01 Jun 1999) win32 binarys (same with 2.8.1) Test case: Lynx renders: normal text this is pre text Same case but with line Lynx renders: normal text this is pre text BR Test case: Lynx renders: normal text this is pre text Any other construction won't work, since GUI Browser would render it different then.  </s>
