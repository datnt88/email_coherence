<s> Here is my action item for checkpoint 2.7.  </s>
<s> I was to add to the rationale and success criteria to explain why authoring tools should not mess with namespaces they don't understand.  </s>
<s> Original 2.7 rationale: Markup that is not recognized by an authoring tool may have been added to enhance accessibility.  </s>
<s> Changed to: Markup that is not recognized by an authoring tool may have been added to enhance accessibility.  </s>
<s> Also, newer XML-based languages, such as XHTML 1.1, allow authors to include multiple languages in a single document, via namespaces.  </s>
<s> In the future, documents may contain metadata, including  </s>
<s> accessibility information, in another namespace.  </s>
<s> Authoring tools must not strip this information when it is encountered.  </s>
<s> Techniques: Implementation Techniques for Checkpoint 2.7, Evaluation Techniques for Checkpoint 2.7 Success Criteria: 1.  </s>
<s> All well-formed markup is preserved.  </s>
<s> 2. The author is queried for their consent before any unrecognized markup is removed or changed.  </s>
<s> Added: 3. The tool does not interfere with content in namespaces it is not able to process.  </s>

<s> Those are XHTML+SMIL and XHTML+MathML+SVG profiles respectively, and not XHTML 1.1.  </s>
<s> XHTML *Modularization* provides a means for extending XHTML, and XHTML 1.1 is a specific document type using Modularization.  </s>
<s> You may extend XHTML 1.1, but when you extend XHTML 1.1, you can't call it XHTML 1.1 anymore.  </s>
