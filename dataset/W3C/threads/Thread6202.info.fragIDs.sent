<s> [I am sending this mail again because it hasn't appeared in the archives - sorry if its a duplicate] The canonical output for test ibm/valid/P02/ibm02v01 contains an empty line after the PI name: ?NAME_09- _0A- _0D- But the input contains only one CRLF between the "_0A-" and the "_0D-".  </s>
<s> Is this an error in the test suite or am I missing something?  </s>

<s> The control file ibm_oasis_valid.xml  </s>
<s> does not list an output file for this test, probably because of this issue.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of the file in the test suite is  </s>
<s> therefore a mistake.  </s>
<s> I notice that the input file seems to have had its line ends normalized at some point, which rather defeats its purpose.  </s>

<s> We were assuming (perhaps wrongly) that the ibm control file was simply incomplete because the OUTPUT attribute is also missing for the following tests which appear to have valid canonical output files:  </s>

<s> Would it be possible to get the input file restored and the control file entry re-instated?  </s>

<s> More likely there was some doubt about the output files, but I don't know for sure.  </s>
<s> Probably.  </s>
<s> I'll get both these points added to the issues list.  </s>
