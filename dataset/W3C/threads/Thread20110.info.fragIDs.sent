<s> There is a problem with the display of tabeles in Amaya Version 4.1 LINUX-ELF binary distribution.  </s>
<s> Here is an example: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd" Une ligne de texte, suivi d'un tableau: Une autre ligne de texte.  </s>
<s> /body  </s>
<s> The table header of the second row (content "B") is displayed below the line of text after the table.  </s>
<s> Version 2.2 (the last one I used before V4.1) displays this example correctly.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the complete bug report.  </s>
<s> I'll check the problem.  </s>
<s> The table formatting is quite complex and any change that fixes a problem can generate another one.  </s>
