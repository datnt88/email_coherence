With both Amaya 2.2 and 2.1, I am unable to open a remote document. 
I can open a document on the local file system without any problem, but each time I enter a complete URL in the address field of the File/OpenDocument dialog box, I get "Cannot load http://..." at the bottom of the main window. 
Amaya 1.4 and 1.3 used to work fine for me in that regard. 
I should probably add that I am using precompiled binaries, and that my machine is running Solaris 2.6. 
I tried both the Solaris 2.5 and Solaris 2.6 precompiled binaries. 
Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.

Bertand, Maybe there's a new firewall or proxy in your lab? 
If you're using a proxy, you'll need to configure Amaya. 
Note that Amaya doesn't implement Netscape's autoproxy mechanism. 
The solaris 2.5 version works well here. 
Could you check this out and come back to us?

Could you check that you don't have a proxy or a firewall. 
If it's not the case could you give us the URL you tried to download. 
Perhaps the server you're addressing doesn't support HTTP 1.1 requests.

If you're using a proxy, you'll need to configure Amaya. 
This is exactly what I did. 
In the Preferences/Proxy dialog box, I indicated the name of the proxy server (proxy.unige.ch) and the local domain name for which the proxy shouldn't be used (.unige.ch). 
I also tried to indicate the port on which the proxy was reachable (proxy.unige.ch:3128), 
but that didn't work either. 
I should probably point out that I was trying to reach the HTTP server that runs on my own workstation (cuisung.unige.ch). 
As soon as I erased the proxy information, the access to my server worked ok. 
Note that Amaya doesn't implement Netscape's autoproxy mechanism. 
I am using plain manual proxy config. 
I just checked it and it works. 
So, I think the problem is not with our proxy, but with my configuring Amaya to use it. 
Peace, Bertrand.

said: Yes, the proxy configuration mechanism is quite misleading. 
I'll try to simplify it for the next version. 
You have to declare your proxy as follows: My guess is that you forgot to add the "http://" string. 
You can also avoid using a proxy to access your local server using the Proxy Menu/No proxy.. entry, and setting it up as: cuisung.unige.ch 
No need to put http:// in this case. 
Thanks for the report and followup :) -Jose jose.kahan@w3.org

Thanks. 
exactly. 
I had it set up as ".unige.ch", 
but the fact that the first field (HTTP proxy) was not correctly set seems to have prevented the second field (no proxy on these domains) from being used. 
Thanks for your quick response. 
Bertrand.
