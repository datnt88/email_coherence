I have sent 2 messages to public-i18n-geo. 
After the first one, I went thru the screen ok'ing public archiving. 
I was surprised to have to ok the second message as well a day later. 
Is the system recording acceptances properly?

Making e-Business Work Around the World (sorry for the slow reply, I am slowly catching up with email after returning from vacation) I believe so. 
There is an extra option on the form that says: ... [ ] This permission applies to any messages I send to any W3C list in the future. 
No need to ask me again. 
Do you recall if you selected that option or not? 
Gerald Oskoboiny http://www.w3.org/People/Gerald/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/ Hi, I suspect not. 
Is it obvious that it requires selection? 
I might have thought it was information telling me I won't be asked again. 
It has been a while. 
Is there a way to see the screen without sendingmail again to the group?

Making e-Business Work Around the World Sorry, no, but the next time you post to a list that uses this system you will have another chance to choose that option when submitting the form. 
I attached a sample of the form.

Apparently posting to this list asked me the question. 
I don't recall if i checked the box or not. 
The way it's laid out I could have missed it. 
Having a checkbox within a radio set is a bit odd, no? I'll be careful to check it and see what happens.

Making e-Business Work Around the World That is the most logical way I could think of to organize it, but better ideas are welcome. 
ok.
