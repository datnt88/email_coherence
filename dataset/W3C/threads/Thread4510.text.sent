Section 4.12 Function Declaration Technical "An XQuery implementation may augment the type system of [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model] with additional types that are designed to facilitate exchange of data with host programming languages": Please make sure that this type is available in the context of the general type system. 
In particular, make sure that it is placed under either one of xs:anyType, xs:anySimpleType or xdt:untypedAtomic and not under concrete types. 
I'm happy to see some constraints on this, but I've found it most convenient to put such types under xdt:anyAtomicType. 
Michael Kay Thanks for catching my mistake. 
I meant xdt:anyAtomicType and not xdt:untypedAtomic... Best regards Michael From: Michael Kay [mailto:mhk@mhk.me.uk] Sent: Tuesday, February 17, 2004 7:25 AM Subject: RE: [XQuery] MS-XQ-LC1-143
