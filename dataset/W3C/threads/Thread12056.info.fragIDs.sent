<s> As to auto-insert of file name/size for ALT: I don't think it should be "nipped in the bud" because it is *something* and that's a GOOD THING; I think it must (if feasible) be the source for a prompt because that's a BETTER THING.  </s>
<s> IOW if no ALT was put in by author, tool should do file info but prompt for improvement from author.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> As an alternative to not doing anything at all about ALT, filename and size is useful.  </s>
<s> In addition, the file size (in particular) is valuable to people who are in low-bandwidth situations.  </s>
<s> But without some idea what the image is about, the information is still not very helpful, because you don't have any way of deciding whether or not the information is useful.  </s>
<s> For an example of how unhelpful this can be, point lynx at http://www.footy99.com.au - something I do most weeks.  </s>
<s> The argument seems to be the same as that for text only sites.  </s>
<s> It is an easy way to automatically do a bad job.  </s>
<s> But you cannot be certain that you have provided anything meaningful, let alone useful.  </s>
<s> To allow a tool to stop at this seems to me a failure - it relies on any accessibility information being included by an accident of nomenclature.  </s>
<s> As an initial default, there is a risk that the benefit it provides will be outwieghed by it being interpreted as an acceptable alt text in most contexts, and not requiring further author attention.  </s>
<s> I think a tool which strongly encourages author involvement in producing sensible and meaningful alteraative content, and which can maintain metadata to offer more valuable defaults for alternatives where they have been previously defined, will minimise that risk.  </s>
<s> A tool which does not require any action on the author's part, or "hides" the ability to change alternate text at the back of some chain of menus will maximise that risk, which has been realised in a widespread pattern already.  </s>
<s> There is another way to get the same information - the name of the resource can often be determined by the User agent - which has it so it can ask for the image, and the file size is one of the things HTTP sends with a head.  </s>

<s> One thing to point out is that it's VERY easy for the filename and/or file size to get out of synch.  </s>
<s> Someone who is now our client at Idyll Mountain Internet previously had a home page that used the "filename.jpg  </s>
<s> 75238 bytes" ALT text for their primary image.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, someone with less sense than is desirable replaced the image with an ANIMATED version of the same logo, that was over 1 meg in size.  </s>
<s> They did not change the ALT text!  </s>
<s> This resulted in a "75238 bytes" ALT text for a file that was much, much larger!  </s>
<s> I would suggest that since the image filename is already available via the SRC attribute, using ALT to convey this redundant information is a poor idea.  </s>
<s> If the image name is required by certain users, then it should be the job of the User Agent (browser) to provide that information upon request, possibly with an option to use the file name as alternative text if there is no value specified for the ALT attribute.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if someone requires the file size, this could likely be accomplished with an intelligent User Agent that issues HEAD requests for all images on the page and presents the size of the content inline.  </s>
<s> I think it's important to separate which information can be supplied by the User Agent and which must be supplied by the Author (or the Authoring Tool).  </s>
<s> If the User Agent can easily and _accurately_ autogenerate something from the information presented to it, then there is no need for the Author or the Authoring Tool to do anything special.  </s>
<s> All the information necessary for the "low bandwidth" user to make a decision can be gathered without needing to take over and misuse ALT, and so it should be avoided whenever possible.  </s>
