<s> Hello all, As I mentioned a few weeks ago at a teleconference, I've been looking for a graphic designer to help us illustrate the working draft of WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> I began discussing possibilities with one person last week, Meg.  </s>
<s> She put together a page that shows icons and screen shots she has designed for other clients.  </s>
<s> This gives an idea of her style.  </s>
<s> It is at: I was thinking she could create icons for each checkpoint and guideline to help illustrate the concepts.  </s>
<s> If someone clicked on the icon they would get a larger image of it, more detailed.  </s>
<s> I sent her Anne's work, but we  </s>
<s> haven't had a chance to discuss it yet.  </s>
<s> I'll be talking with her again this week, any questions you would like me to ask her?  </s>
<s> My proposal: I'll ask her to illustrate checkpoint 1.1 to see what she comes up with.  </s>
<s> We can then talk about it.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>
<s> --w wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa  </s>
<s> Bruce, If we include icons and illustrations with the guidelines, we will certainly improve the comprehension of the guidelines, and make it easier for people to find the pertinant sections.  </s>
<s> The earcons are also to help people find the pertinant sections.  </s>
<s> It would be most useful if the earcons were automatically included in the sound/speech output done for a non-sighted person, as they would then duplicate the use of the icons for those who are sighted.  </s>
<s> I do NOT think that illustrative and graphical talent is spread as thinly in the population as you think.  </s>
<s> I've seen too much quality stuff on the web (not necessarily accessible), to think it's hard to do.  </s>
<s> If there were not some excellent writers in the bunch, we'd be looking for someone to  </s>
<s> construct the text as well as the graphics!  </s>
<s> (and sometimes when I'm reading  </s>
<s> the guidelines, I wonder if that isn't essential anyway!) As William said, it's now a matter of "when", not "if"... If nothing else, Lisa Seaman's response to my not-professional level illustrations indicates that it must be a "when" if we are going to do what the charter says we're to do.  </s>
<s> If there were 2 or 3 more on the committee with more background in graphics, but I'm simply not good enough at it to do what needs to be done.  </s>
<s> One hires a professional to do whatever one cannot, whether it's to replace the transmission in a car, or to change the oil because one doesn't want to get yucky, or illustrate a document as important as the one we are working on.  </s>
<s> I expect, as Meg goes about doing the job of a professional, she will end up learning a lot about web design from an accessibility standpoint, if she doesn't know already.  </s>
<s> William and I, and perhaps others did notice that when one goes about the task of illustrating text, the problems in the writing stand out.  </s>
<s> Sometimes I had to add to the text mentally, in order to make a complete and useful illustration, and sometimes I had to choose which parts of the text to illustrate since to illustrate all would have required too large a piece (at least with my limited illustrating skills).  </s>
<s> Unless a cost-benefit analysis is required of all guidelines, I don't think the issue of including graphics needs to be addressed.  </s>
<s> What is the cost-benefit of requiring a sequenced script of audio and multi-media?  </s>
<s> Was that a consideration?  </s>
<s> Or is this a strawman?  </s>
<s> As William says, we're finally to the point of saying this is a "when", not an "if" ... Lisa made the point of how necessary this is when the reader is directly in the targeted audience ... Bruce, the guidelines are very good at explaining how to make alternatives for graphics, sound, and multi-media but not very good at explaining how to make alternatives for text.  </s>
<s> Filling in that gap is another step in meeting the goal of the charter ... Anne  </s>
<s> Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com  </s>
<s> The thread so far seems to be taking for granted the concept that graphical elements will be added to a single, monolithic guidelines document, and I'd like to challenge that assumption.  </s>
<s> I think that we should consider the development of a non-text-oriented guidelines implementation as an adjunct to the current model.  </s>
<s> The core of HTML, which, while hacked over the years to accommodate various forms of multimedia, was designed to present textual information in a structured format such as that used in the W3C specifications.  </s>
<s> I think it's important that, at least, one way the guidelines are presented is in the same structured format we have now.  </s>
<s> Graphical examples, icons and earcons inside each guideline and checkpoint have the effect of adding clutter that detracts from the familiar structure of the document, which is an access problem all its own.  </s>
<s> The only way around this limitation is to design to the strengths of graphical and multimedia presentation to explain the content of the document.  </s>
<s> If this is done using, say, SVG, it could be linked with the HTML guidelines, and it wouldn't violate the checkpoint on using languages, etc. that can be made accessible (Flash being a severe trouble spot here).  </s>
<s> In fact, I think this is something we need to consider in our discussion of the inclusion of graphics and multimedia with a view toward accessibility: the most effective repurposing of an awful lot of content depends on that content being restructured (or even rewritten) for the medium.  </s>
<s> The most basic example of that is that newscasters don't read magazine articles on the air, and magazines don't print TV transcripts.  </s>
<s> If the presence of other media is a requirement, it's essential that the content provider must have the latitude to design for those media, rather than continuing to shoehorn media into HTML.  </s>
<s> (Note that this does not imply my approval of such a requirement; just that in that event, the need is there.) m  </s>
<s> Matt, Whatever multi-media you are planning to create in, please know that shockwave crashes on an NT system, Flash does not .... Folks who are accessing information on a work system may have NT, and would be more able to use Flash ... Anne  </s>
<s> Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com  </s>
<s> I do not wish to plug NT however we do have an nt network, and it runs shockwave fine.  </s>
<s> jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com  </s>
<s> Hmmmm .... and we have continual crashes on the NT machines when we try to use sites with shockwave games.  </s>
<s> Wonder what is causing the problem?  </s>
