Words to that effect appear in Sect.

They should say, instead, that either an absoluteURI or Host request-header must accompany all HTTP/1.1 requests.

I don't believe that was the resolution agreed to. 
There was insufficient trust that implementers would get it right, if it were optional. 
Better to require sending the redundant information all the time; simple rule, can't be mis-interpreted.

For now it's probably safer to require that Host: appear on ALL 1.1 requests, regardless of whether or not the Request-URI includes the Host information. 
there's more assurance this way that some people won't screw it up. 
More importantly: consider what happens if ClientFoo does not send the Host:, instead deciding to send absoluteURI, and ClientFoo is talking to a proxy. 
If that proxy is old, it will strip the host info out of the Reqest-URI and pass it on. 
Now our 1.1 origin server gets no Host: and no absoluteURI. 
Sure - we could make special case language saying "You have to send Host:, unless you are talking to a 1.1 server you dont have to, but you do have to if your talking to a proxy." 
What was it JG was saying?: "Protocols can only stand so many special purpose hacks." 
As such, I think we have good reason, and rough consensus, for Host: header to be mandatory on all 1.1 requests. 
Which is why the issue was closed, and the language exists in the spec. the Programmer formerly known as Dan
