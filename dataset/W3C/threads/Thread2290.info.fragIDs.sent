<s> Better to require sending the redundant information all the time; simple rule, can't be mis-interpreted.  </s>

<s> For now it's probably safer to require that Host: appear on ALL 1.1 requests, regardless of whether or not the Request-URI includes the Host information.  </s>
<s> there's more assurance this way that some people won't screw it up.  </s>
<s> More importantly: consider what happens if ClientFoo does not send the Host:, instead deciding to send absoluteURI, and ClientFoo is talking to a proxy.  </s>
<s> If that proxy is old, it will strip the host info out of the Reqest-URI and pass it on.  </s>
<s> Now our 1.1 origin server gets no Host: and no absoluteURI.  </s>
<s> Sure - we could make special case language saying "You have to send Host:, unless you are talking to a 1.1 server you dont have to, but you do have to if your talking to a proxy."  </s>
<s> What was it JG was saying?: "Protocols can only stand so many special purpose hacks."  </s>
<s> As such, I think we have good reason, and rough consensus, for Host: header to be mandatory on all 1.1 requests.  </s>
<s> Which is why the issue was closed, and the language exists in the spec. the Programmer formerly known as Dan  </s>
