Hi there, I cannot decide if the following is a MUST-level requirement (i.e., its violation prevents RFC 2616 compliance, even conditional): 13.10 Invalidation After Updates or Deletions In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST only be performed if the host part is the same as in the Request-URI. 
Suppose the host part is not the same as in the Request-URI. 
Let's also assume that the device did perform an invalidation, subjecting itself to a potential DoS attack. 
Did the device violate a MUST-level requirement? 
The answer seems to depend on how you bind "only": [ ] Yes, this is a MUST-level violation because foo MUST only blah if bar implies if not bar, foo MUST NOT blah [ ] No, this is not a MUST-level violation because foo MUST only blah if bar implies just that if bar, foo MUST blah and requires nothing when bar is false ("if not bar") I suspect that the intended interpretation is "yes, this is a MUST violation". 
Can anybody confirm? 
Is there really a problem with the wording, or am I imagining an ambiguity? 
Thank you, Alex. Sorry for the slow reply on this: I cannot decide if the following is a MUST-level requirement (i.e., its violation prevents RFC 2616 compliance, even conditional): 13.10 Invalidation After Updates or Deletions In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST only be performed if the host part is the same as in the Request-URI.

I'm pretty sure that I wrote the text in 13.10 (not 100% sure), so I guess this is my problem. 
If you can't understand what it means, then I guess that does mean that the wording isn't sufficiently clear. 
Perhaps this is a clearer wording: In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST NOT be performed if the host part of that URI differs from the host part in the Request-URI. 
This corresponds to your "[ ] Yes" alternative above. 
The other intepretation doesn't seem to prevent any DOS attacks. 
(If I had meant the other alternative, I would have written something like "foo MUST be performed if bar"). 
Clear? 
-Jeff Hi Jeff, Thanks for the clarification! 
I agree that the "[] No" interpretation would make little practical sense, but I am sure that when our test suite detects this violation, some violators would use the ambiguity as an excuse. 
Now I can use your response as a munition ;-). 
If there is a chance to update the protocol specs, I think it would be a good idea to use your new wording. 
I would also suggest, if I may, that the words "In order to prevent denial of service attacks," are deleted or at least isolated from the MUST requirement in a separate non-normative statement: An invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST NOT be performed if the host part of that URI differs from the host part in the Request-URI. 
This restriction helps prevent denial of service attacks. 
Alex.
