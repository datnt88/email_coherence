Hello all, The primary question from Monday's telecon was "how do we convince developers to use EARL." We've put this on the agenda for our joint conference call with the AU WG on Monday. 
Can we think of arguments, that are not accessibility related, that we could use to convince developers? 
For example, how would we convince the DOM test harness developers to produce EARL. 
Why would they want to do that? 
As we discussed Monday, the DOM WG wants to combine results of several test harnesses (to show interoperability?). 
The guts of the test harnesses can be completely different, but as long as they all produce markup someone/thing could combine results between them to get the overall conformance picture. 
Which is why they are currently "looking at developing a language-neutral form of representing tests (including expected results for advanced reports), documentation and other relevant details. 
We want this format to be language-neutral to support porting to most existing languages." 
[1] To this end, they have developed methods.dtd 
[2]. 
Will the "steep RDF learning curve" that Curt refers to [3] and Dimitris agrees with [4] be a problem in adoption? 
I think this is part of the issue that William was raising from his work with the Device Independence Working Group and why he wanted a low-level primer. 
Therefore, the issue seems to be adoption of RDF over XML rather than EARL in general. 
Thoughts? 
Am I off base? 
I'm still trying to get my head around this. 
Be well, --wendy [1] http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/ [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0067.html [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0103.html [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0106.html wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa I wonder how well EARL can integrate a foreign framework already specifying testcase description in XML or RDF. 
We have some support for testcase description EARL (purpose, id, etc), is that optional, in conflict, or complementary with what could be found in the DOM methods.dtd ? 
RDF itself isn't difficult at all to "learn", it's just that there is a startling lack of tutorials, and a huge amount of assumed best practices which are only encoded in streams of list archives. 
Ooh, time for a bit of RDF cheerleading. 
Why RDF and not XML? 
Why reinvent the wheel? 
With RDF, there is a single standard data model (triples), fully decentralized, and with numerous implementations, APIs and parsers. 
If you invent your own language in pure XML, you are in essence also developing a data model. 
There are numerous problems with this:- 1) You are slowed down because you have to work out a data model - just use RDFs (although you do have to learn it, but surely learning is easier than creating). 
2) Other people then have to learn your data model, and build tools to process it. 
Again: why reinvent the wheel? 
3) Interoperability with other languages is then next to impossible. 
With RDF based languages, it is still difficult, but at least possible. 
There are many more hints in TimBL's missive:- the best bit is:- The expression you need for querying something in terms of the XML tree is necessarily more complicated than the expression you need for querying something in terms of the RDF tree.

hello all, (Dimitris, I'm including you 1/2 way through the thread. 
It begins at [1]. 
We're trying to understand the DOM perspective re: EARL/metadata/XML. 
here's my response to Sean Palmer's latest post in the thread) which makes it time consuming to learn. 
many people don't have time or patience. 
rah! 
rah! 
siss boom bah! 
grin/ Depends on the person, no? 
If someone has invented several XML languages, then they could more easily do that than learn something new. 
Also, many people will continue using familiar tools rather than spending time learning the benefits of new tools. 
There are trade-offs and not all people will choose the same path. 
Some people just want to get things done and will use whatever tools are closest and that they know will work. 
Our job is to help with the transition since we believe we have a better tool. 
Basic marketing I suppose. 
but how many people do you know who still use an older version of a browser because they know it works or don't see the need to take the time to download the latest and greatest or perhaps use it for testing purposes or some other reason - perhaps it works better with other tools that they have? 
and they will continue to use it even though they know there are new features in the latest version but they might not see the need for those new features when they are comfortable with what they have. 
Isn't that the point of XML and namespaces, tho? 
e.g. embedding SVG into XHTML? 
I don't know RDF well enough to fully appreciate the beauty of this statement, but I do know XSLT and SQL so I am trying to think of this in those terms. 
Looking at Tim's paper again, he is primarily discussing machine-readable info, right? 
At this point, I'm assuming people are still the primary readers of the content in some of the applications we're talking about. 
For example, in the DOM group, they know the schema, so that's not a "big if" for them. 
It is difficult to see past that. 
also, they have tools that help them write using their DTD (XED, for example). 
Are there the same types of tools for RDF? 
Where you can easily plug in a schema and author? 
I was amazed how easy it is to use a new DTD with XED. 
Therefore, perhaps this gets back to tools, and I again apologize for still getting up to speed on this stuff myself. 
The point I'm trying to make is that when someone is working closely with the semantics and they know how to express them comfortably in XML, then convincing them to learn a new language and think about things in a different way can be a difficult task and it seems that that might be the task at hand. 
I am only trying to look at this from another perspective. 
I do see the need for EARL to be machine-readable (and thus in RDF) and think that it would benefit the DOM test suites as well, but to give them a strong argument I am trying to see things from their perspective...some of this is conjecture, thus I CC'ed Dimitris on my reply. 
Daniel raised an interesting question in his post: What about integrating EARL into an existing framework. 
This seems to be what Curt and Dimitris had discussed [2], [3]. 
Curt describes three phases in which it might be possible to use EARL. 
He proposes keeping the current schema but adding a metadata element that can contain RDF info. 
His example uses Dublin Core info about an author - who created a test. 
It seems easy to then say, "who says that I pass the test" ala EARL. 
However, Dimitris proposes leaving the metadata element optional since developers will already have had to learn the NIST DTD and they don't want to further burden them.

It depends a lot on your background and means of introduction as well... some people get it in an instant. 
Personally, it took a while to know who to speak to, what to read, and so forth, but once done, it's quite easy to get into. 
The basic level of information is no harder than learning to write XHTML, and is certanly not as difficult as learning XML Schema, in my opinion. 
Only for models which are pre-existing. 
What I'm saying is that when you create an arbitrary data language using XML Schema or similar XML schemata, you will almost invariably be creating your own data model, and will have to document it, and provide tools to grok it. 
RDF provides a data model which people from all over the globe took years to write and agree upon, and so in using it you gain all of that data-model experience for free. 
We have a "tool" which is based upon a widely implemented, well-documented, data model developed by the W3C. 
We have a tool which people are able to parse, manipulate, and make sense of with many publically available and free implementations. 
No screen scraping involved, and little interpretation required. 
Nostalgia? 
eBusinesses would be eaten alive if they had the, "oh, we know about computerized stock quotes, be we like our old stock ticker - we're used to it now" attitude. 
And anyhow, for many people, we'll be saying "instead of creating your own evaluation model, look, we've made one for you!". 
For those that have already made a model, we can point out the benefits of data interoperability, and getting rid of the screen scraping layer. 
The old way of doing things: namespaces allow a processor to ignore a fragment of code if it doesn't recognize the URI/URI-ref being used as a namespace. 
The new way is to try to partially understand the new content, by derferencing links to the schemata, or whatever. 
But that's Semantic Web territory rather than RDF. 
What I mean with interoperability is that there are plenty of processors which understand the RDF data model, and can parse it. 
But is RDF any more difficult to read than any other particular XML application? 
Also, it's very easy to scrape XHTML from RDF information - DanC has done so on a number of occasions. 
Just because something is machine readable, it doesn't exclude it from being human readable. 
However, when something is human readable, it is rarely machine readable. 
All RDF is machine readable, and Notation3 does a pretty good job of being human readable too. 
Are there the same types of tools for RDF? 
Where you can easily plug in a schema and author? 
Try:- -RDFViz - Prot?g? Into an existing framework? 
Not too difficult - although if the implementation uses XSD or something, you'd need to draft up an XML Schema version of EARL... hmm.

And Curt jumps in 5/6ths of the way through after not realizing what this thread was about until the last moment. 
What I think would be a coup for EARL on test reporting would be if EARL support could be integrated into JUnit (or other xUnit derivatives) in a non-disruptive manner. 
Basically, with a future release of JUnit, any existing test suite could have its results reported in EARL via a command-line option. 
The first hurdle would be providing a URI for the test. 
If a URI for the test was not specified, one could be generated from the class and method name using the java: protocol described at argument. 
I guess the target of the test could be specified on a command line or in the user interface. 
Has anyone had any interaction with the JUnit community? 
Of course, all of the proceeding is downstream of the DOM TS effort.
