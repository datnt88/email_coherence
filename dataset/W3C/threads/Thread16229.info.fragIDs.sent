All, The following commentary will be posted shortly on the www.icdri.org 
web site. 
It has to do with the new law that will be voted on tomorrow in the US Congress. 
It is called The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (Engrossed House Amendment) S. 761 Cynthia Waddell one of the foremost legal experts on the accessibility of electronic and Information technology raises some very serious questions. 
Sincerely, Mike Burks The commentary is reproduced in full below: Questions about Electronic Signature Bill: Will Everyone Be Able to Participate? 
By Cynthia D. Waddell On Wednesday, June 14, the House will vote on the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (Engrossed House Amendment) S. 761 (http://www.house.gov/floor/thisweek.htm). 
According to Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA) of the House Committee on Commerce, ?Electronic signatures and records will help grow the digital economy by giving American consumers greater confidence in their online business transactions. 
This is one of the most important steps Congress can take to help foster the growth of the digital economy.? See June 9 News Release by the House Committee on Commerce. 
This Bill is historic in that it seeks to overcome barriers to contract formation on the web. 
But there are significant practical and legal questions that have not been addressed and so this brief commentary seeks to highlight those issues for discussion and attention. 
Citations to the applicable Bill section is posted after each discussion in this commentary. 
Of particular concern are consumers with disabilities and their ability to enter into contracts on the web. 
For a person with a visual disability to access an electronic contract, the document needs to be coded for accessible web design when it is created. 
In general, S. 761 EAH (Engrossed House Amendment) states that the legal effect, validity, or enforceability of the electronic contract shall not be denied because of the type or method of the electronic record selected by the parties. 
Does this mean that an electronic contract not coded for accessibility could still be enforceable even when the consumer did not know they could not read portions of the contract? 
Sec. 
101(b)(1)(B) Moreover, how can a blind person consent to a contract when parts of it may be hidden from their assistive computer technology (i.e., screenreader or text-browser)? 
Consumers with visual disabilities could conceivably consent to the contract not knowing that parts of the contract were not coded for accessibility. 
Sec. 
101(b)(2)(A)(i) Prior to consenting to a contract, the consumer is to be provided with a statement of hardware and software needed to access and retain the electronic contract. 
This feature will not overcome the necessity of creating or coding an accessible web design contract. 
Unless the electronic record or contract is itself constructed with accessible web design elements, it will be useless to indicate what hardware or software is needed to access the electronic contract. 
The efforts of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (http://www.w3.org/WAI) as well as the current U.S. Access Board Section 508 Rulemaking (http://www.access-board.gov/RULES/508nprm.htm) 
addressing specifications for accessible web design is evidence of this problem. 
Sec. 
101(b)(2)(A)(ii) Perhaps a greater concern for anyone, regardless of disability, is the requirement that the consumer consent to the hardware and software necessary to access and retain the electronic contract. 
What is the impact of this feature in the Bill? 
Does this mean that cell phones and personal digital assistants will not be able to access the content of the contract? 
Why does the Bill not embrace accessible web design so that the widest audience of consumers can benefit from electronic contracts? 
Even if the electronic contract is capable of review, retention and printing by the consumer if the hardware and software are utilized, will the consumer have the particular hardware and software necessary to access the content of the contract? 
Sec. 
101(b)(2)(B) And what is meant by accessibility? 
The Bill requires that the contract remain accessible for later reference, transmission and printing. 
The definitions in the Bill do not define accessibility. 
Sec. 
101(c)(1) Of particular interest is the statement that a state statute or other rule of law may not supercede this law if it discriminates in favor of or against a specific technology, process or technique of creating the contract. 
Again, what about the benefits of accessible web design in the creation of the electronic contract? 
Sec. 
102(b)(1) As mentioned above, current rulemaking by the U.S. Access Board under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the creation of accessible web content so that people with disabilities can participate in the digital economy. 
How will this be impacted? 
Although Section 103 has specific exclusions allowing for federal agency requirements that records be filed or maintained in a specific standard, the language in the Bill does not give an exclusion for the federal requirements for the creation of the document, ie accessible web design. 
Sec. 
103(a)(4) Even the definition of "record" includes the requirement that it be "retrievable in perceivable form." 
What do we do with electronic contracts where a person without a visual disability can perceive the contract but a person with a disability cannot? 
Sec. 
105 (5) Lastly, Section 201 addresses the treatment of electronic signatures in interstate and foreign commerce. 
There are references to the use of electronic records in the global market. 
How will this Bill create issues with those countries that have adopted accessible web design requirements? 
Some food for thought. 
What do you think? 
Cynthia D. Waddell 
As far as I know, the only discussion of accessiblity of Electronic signatures has been initiated by Cynthia Waddell. 
She is the only one who has seen the implications. 
This is serious and it will be voted on today in the US. Congressmen and Senators need to be made aware. 
I sent the same message to each of them who has an email id, but I doubt that they have read it.

I think I also heard an item on the radio this morning to the effect that the Ontario House of Commons has passed legislation to give electronic signatures the weight of law similar to that previously only given to paper signatures. 
Has there been similar discussion of accessibility in the Canadian context?
