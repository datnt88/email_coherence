This is a reminder that we will not have a conference call today. 
Many group members are in transit or at the WWW9 meetings. 
Our next meeting will be Tues the 23rd. 
Those of you who committed to send proposed rewordings of the definition for prompt to the list, please do it by the end of this week. 
We will try to resolve the issues related to guideline 3.1 and the definition of prompt on the 23rd. 
Thanks Jutta Potential regrets - I may be available, but I may have W3C team commitments in Amsterdam.
