<s> To the group: Recently, I directed some questions to Charles McCathieNevile regarding Amaya and he encouraged me to bring the topic here, to this list, for group input.  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for the opportunity.  </s>
<s> I am helping a local school develop their web presence.  </s>
<s> As part of this project, though, I need to leave them able to maintain the site themselves (with occasional monitoring by me) and I am searching for a best authoring tool for them to use.  </s>
<s> All students at the school are blind or low-vision.  </s>
<s> Several teachers and a few students will need to do the work, and my hope is to find a program that allows them to work in a text-editing environment and apply style sheets and formatting while relying on the program to generate code that meets accessibility guidelines.  </s>
<s> (I'll provide templates and models so they mostly won't create pages from scratch.) I want the students to be able to work using a screen reader and the teachers to work in WYSIWYG.  </s>
<s> There is no perfect tool, of course, and quirks and shortcomings are just part of what we will accept in the process of what we're doing.  </s>
<s> My hope is that some people here may have some experience and insight into a best choice.  </s>
<s> I invite your response and I hope the discussion proves helpful.  </s>
<s> I need to make a choice this summer, and will be able to do some testing with summer school students.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> For all that I am asking, Amaya sounds like a reasonable choice.  </s>
<s> But Charles has reservations about it in terms of meeting ATAG, not the least of which are validity checking and a concern that it may not work well with screen readers.  </s>
<s> Still, it looks like Amaya's basic functionality and support of accessible design is not bad. 2. Charles has also suggested looking at Mozilla, which I shall do.  </s>
<s> 3. And I wonder also about Macromedia Dreamweaver with Homesite.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what to add to my questions at this point -- but I'd be happy to respond to yours.  </s>
<s> Thank you. .  </s>

<s> The last time I tried working with Amaya, more than a year ago, it was difficult to use with Window-Eyes.  </s>
<s> The problem seemed to be that the graphics widgets had come from other environments such as X-Windows, not native Windows controls, so a Windows screen reader didn't know what these controls were supposed to do.  </s>
<s> If I had spent more time with a knowledgeable sighted person, we might have figured some of it out.  </s>
<s> Fundamentally, this is the problem you would have with Mozilla.  </s>
<s> Recently they have been working on adding Microsoft Active Accessibility into the Windows version of Netscape, and this would help reading web pages immensely.  </s>
<s> But I don't know how it would work for authoring and editing.  </s>
<s> Some folks have had good success with older versions of Netscape Composer.  </s>
<s> I have experimented with Mozilla's XML and XSLT programs inside the Cygwin environment.  </s>
<s> Since this is text, it's accessible with a DOS screen reader, but the results from XMLLint are pretty technical.  </s>
<s> What screen reader do they use?  </s>
<s> JAWS works great if there are scripts for the program, but somebody has to get down and dirty with the script language if no scripts have been written.  </s>
<s> Several blind people with JAWS and Window-Eyes have tried to work with existing versions of DreamWeaver and given up.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Macromedia is working on this, as they have successfully with Flash 6.  </s>
<s> Home Site probably can be used.  </s>

<s> Some blind users like Arachnophilia.  </s>
<s> Along the same lines, I used to use an old version of Hotdog Professional.  </s>
<s> Both programs allowed you to apply tags to selected areas of a document and their menus were accessible.  </s>
<s> I have worked with XML authoring in WordPerfect 9 and 10; the process is accessible, and WP helps you validate your document against your DTD, but the process is cumbersome.  </s>
<s> XML spy is moderatly screen reader compatible.  </s>
<s> But it is so complex and loaded with tools that I found it ran quite slowly and it was easy to get lost in the screen clutter.  </s>

<s> From tom mcCain: Quite the contrary, Lloyd.  </s>
<s> I find your comments, and those from Dave Pawson, to be very helpful.  </s>
<s> Yes, there is no perfect answer but your insights have helped steer me toward some options for the school.  </s>
<s> It sounds like the students could work in Composer or Ultraedit in the beginning and we could test Dreamweaver, Amaya and Mozilla during the fall semester, keeping in mind the potential limitations that you list.  </s>

<s> It's a fairly simple to use program based around a WYSIWYG interface that allows you to create webpages as if you were using a word processor.  </s>
<s> It has the option to review and edit the HTML code as HTML which can be useful especially as a learning tool.  </s>
<s> I haven't used the new version for all that long but from what I have seen it is accessible with JAWS and is a good tool for creating websites if you aren't that familiar with HTML.  </s>
