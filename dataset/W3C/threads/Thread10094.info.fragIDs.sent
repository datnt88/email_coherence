<s> Is rdf:value still in the RDF namespace?  </s>
<s> If so, what is it supposed to mean?  </s>
<s> The most recent schema doc says that it 'identifies' the 'principal value' of a property when the property value is a 'structured resource'.  </s>
<s> None of the quoted words in this make any sense at all to me.  </s>

<s> I believe rdf:value is fairly widely used, as something along the lines of 'a stringy represention of something'.  </s>
<s> Are there any better defintions on the table?  </s>

<s> Struggling to follow this.... so aaa rdf:value bbb .  </s>
<s> means that bbb is a string and bbb represents aaa (?) Does it follow that bbb is a literal value?  </s>
<s> Well, what I really want is to know what Im supposed to say its property extension has got in it, its domain and range, its sub- and super-properties, etc.. Pat  </s>
