This Question was passed onto Bjoern, I take he does not know so I ask again to the group as well I just went to http://tidy.sf.net . 
and got transferred to http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy then I downloaded " tidy_win32.exe 
" I got it to check out (test.htm) h1 {color:red} it said HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st September 2001; built on Sep 15 2001, at 19:16:06) Parsing "E:\HTML-T~1\TEST.HTM_newver.htm" 
No warnings or errors were found. 
OK, I think I like the 05-08-00 15:21 release better From Eric They are illegal cases, however content becomes strange after Tidying, so I report them.

Version: 6.0.307 / Virus Database: 168 - Release Date: 11-12-01 I can't reproduce your problem with either the 04 Aug 00 or current (17 Dec 01) version of Tidy. 
Is there more info about your use of Tidy that we need in order to reproduce your problem? 
I don't know what the 05-08-00 version is, but maybe Charlie built that one. 
Here is what both versions of Tidy I tested with, had to say about your sample HTML : line 13 column 1 - Warning: content occurs after end of body Regards, Terry Hi Terry I just read your Email, I will get back to you in about 12 hours from this Email and answer you questions, I just went to http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy and could only down load the 04 Aug 00 issue, how does one get the current (17 Dec 01) version From Eric again I can't reproduce your problem with either the 04 Aug 00 or current (17 Dec 01) version of Tidy.

Version: 6.0.309 / Virus Database: 170 - Release Date: 17-12-01 Depends on whether you want pre-built binaries for certain platforms, or if you are capable of downloading the source and building it for yourself. 
1) Pre-built binaries (betas, for some platforms) : 2) Source code (current, for all supported platforms) : Hope this helps. 
Regards, Terry Will there ever be a real tar file created for some recent set of tidy changes? 
Having access only to a cvs repository is really a nuisance when what one really wants is to build the code - downloading each individual piece because one can't get to cvs (firewalls, whatever) means an myriad of places for things to go wrong.

- - Definitely when an actual release of the current code is made - we are not in that position yet. 
I was in the process of automating nightly builds and uploads of tarballs when my access to the SF compile farm got corrupted. 
I have since got my access back, but I have been too busy (and there were a couple of problems automating the uploads I hadn't resolved) to do any more work on this. 
I don't find it a nuisance, and you should be able to get the whole thing with a single CVS command. 
I personally use a GUI based CVS tool, and it works great for me. 
But to prove that it can be done with a single CVS command, I have copied the command I used while automating the builds (I have left out stuff that is not needed) : cd tidy; cvs -d ':pserver:anonymous@cvs.tidy.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tidy' 
update . 
(note the period at the end - representing the current directory). 
This was on the SF compile farm, using the "bash" shell, mostly on some version of Linux. 
It assumes you have a directory called "tidy" in the current directory. 
If/when I get time, I will try to make another attempt to automate nightly builds and uploads of tarballs. 
Hope this helps. 
Regards, Terry Unfortunately, the cvs command doesn't work through firewalls (at least some of the ones being used) . 
Thanks though for being patient. 
Someone the other day mentioned that if I really wanted sf.net stuff badly enough there's always the full cvs backup ftp URL that I could use. 
Then I just have to build a local cvs repository for it. 
I'm just not certain I am ready to go to that extreme yet.
