Hello, I'd like to make two stylistic but important points about the 2 May 2003 draft of XSLT 2.0 [1]. 1) Some words are underlined but are not links. 
In the context of the Web, this can be confusing. 
I recommend that some other convention be used to emphasize those words. 
Some examples are "doc" or "collection". 
2) I noted in 2.2 Notation that "An attribute is required if and only if its name is in bold." 
For accessibility reasons, please do not rely on style alone to convey information, especially normative information. 
Someone listening to the document read as synthesized speech is likely to miss this. 
It's fine to highlight required attributes by using bold text, or colors, for example. 
But there needs to (also) be a indication in text. 
One suggestion is that in the appendix C, before "Permitted parent elements", include a line "Required attributes: a, b, c" Thank you, _ Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#notation Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

These should become hyperlinks to a different document in the family of specs at the next version. 
I used the "underlined but not linked" convention as an editorial marker that links should be added when the target documents were stable enough to allow linking. 
Thanks for this, a useful comment. 
I'm not immediately sure how best to address it but will try to meet your concerns. 
Michael Kay Hi Michael, Thank you for the explanation. 
I apologize if I missed an explanatory note to that effect. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
One other approach would be to use the word "required" in the prose description of the meaning of the attribute. 
For instance, in 16.3.1: 
"The required name attribute specifies the name of the key." or "The name attribute (required) specifies the name of the key." _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)
