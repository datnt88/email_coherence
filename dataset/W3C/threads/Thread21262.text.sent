(Just a quick note to capture an idea that cropped up over lunch with Marja) Our XML/RDF annotation vocabularies should capture the language primarily used in any textual content within the annotation. 
For eg., as a dc:language property of the annotation. 
This would allow consumer applications to filter out a particular natural languages view of some annotation resource. 
For example use case, Spanish or chinese or .... annotations of http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ could be pulled out via an RDF query. 
For users browsing through content in a language that isn't their first, this could be a really useful service: one might view a page overlaid with all the annotations of it that have been made in some selected natural language. 
(I'd expect this to be one of a vast number of ways we'll select annotations of interest using RDF queries). 
Related idea: annotation servers implemented over HTTP might be able to pick up language of the annotator from HTTP headers, rather than needing special case support. 
Dan (semantic web geek) Would current clients break if we started posting annotations with dc:language properties straightaway? 
Or should we wait until such a usage is officially sanctioned? 
Matthew Wilson The clients should not break if they were written properly. 
If adding such a property to the RDF that encodes an annotation breaks a client then the client doesn't understand a key feature of RDF - its extensibility. 
Adding a new property to an annotation should not cause problems for Amaya or the Annotea bookmarklets. 
Of course, these Annotea clients may not do anything with the new property but they certainly should not break. 
Art That's what I thought. 
I may experiment with this in Annozilla... Matthew Sensible RDF applications should always "expect the unexpected", ie. not be suprised to find a variety of additional pieces of data ("annotations", in a broad sense of the term) decorating RDF graphs. 
From what I know of the 3 Annotea clients, they should all be OK with additional properties attached to an annotation, since they use an RDF parser rather than match against hard-coded XML encodings of the data structure.
