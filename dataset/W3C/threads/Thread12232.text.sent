Dear all, thanks to Ian there is a new draft at The following outlines the text added to (or in some cases the new vesrions of text in) the draft which will be published shortly. 
This text is intended to resolve the concerns raised in member review (except the suggestion about having a "priority 0", for which the proposed resolution is not to do it). 
From the definitions of priority: as part of relative priority: All authoring tools should support all applicable Web Content Guideline checkpoints, but the nature of that support may vary according to the nature of the authoring tool, the expected skill level of the author using the tool, and the requirements of each WCAG checkpoint. 
In some cases support can be provided automatically, without the need for explicit author participation, in other cases human judgment is required and support is provided by the tool in the form of prompts and documentation. 
and as a general not on priorities: In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the Working Group has assumed that "the author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has no prior knowledge of accessibility. 
For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the documentation but is expected to know how to turn to the documentation for assistance. 
From the Conformance section (note that the piece on applicability in the 2 december draft was removed) Note. 
Some example conformance evaluations are available. 
It should be noted that conformance claims are not necessarily validated or endorsed by W3C. 
Checkpoint 1.3 (as per the meeting yesterday): 1.3 Ensure that when the tool automatically generates markup it conforms to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT]. 
[Relative Priority] Checkpoint 3.1: 3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information (e.g., captions, auditory descriptions and collated text transcripts for video). 
[Relative Priority] Note. 
Some Checkpoints in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT] may not be applicable. 
Checkpoint 3.2: 3.2 Help the author create structured content and separate information from its presentation. 
[Relative Priority] Note: Some Checkpoints in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT] may not be applicable. 
First para of guideline 4 introduction: Many authoring tools allow authors to create documents with little or no knowledge about the underlying markup. 
To ensure accessibility, authoring tools must be designed so that they can (where possible automatically) identify inaccessible markup, and enable its correction even when the markup itself is hidden from the author. 
Checkpoint 4.1: 4.1 Check for and alert the author to accessibility problems. 
[Relative Priority] Note: Accessibility problems should be detected automatically where possible. 
Where this is not possible, the tool may need to prompt the user to make decisions, or to manually check for certain types of problem. 
Check for, in 4.1 is linked to the follwing definition in the definitions section: Check for as used in checkpoint 4.1, check for can refer to three types of checking: In some instances an authoring tool will be able to check automatically. 
For example checking for validity Refer also to checkpoint 2.2. or testing whether an image is the only content of a link. 
In some cases the tool will be able to "suspect" or "guess"that there is a problem, but will need to confirm with the author. 
For example, in making sure that a sensible reading order is preserved a tool can present a linearided version of a page to the author. 
In some cases a tool must rely mostly on the author, and can only ask the author to check. 
For example, prompting the author to check whether equivalent alternatives for multimedia are appropriate. 
This is the minimal standard to be satisfied. 
Subtle, rather than extensive, prompting is more likely to be effective in encouraging the user to verify accessibility where it canot be done automatically.

Charles did the work. 
I tweaked the publication. 
- Ian Which is half the work. 
And not the point. 
I forgot to mention that I have added references to ERT, the XML draft guidelines, accessibility notes, etc to 4.1 techniques as pointers for now. 
Cheers Charles That's misleading.

- Ian W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI 21 Mitchell Street, Footscray, VIC 3011, Australia (I've moved!) Another thing I forgot :-( The checklists now have text explaining that they refer to WCAG, and can be met at three different priority levels. 
(THe table version doesn't make a space for that yet) I ahve not updated the issues list to reflect yesterday's meeting - that will have to wait until thursday.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI 21 Mitchell Street, Footscray, VIC 3011, Australia (I've moved!) I like the wording on 1.3, 3.1, and 3.2 with the following editorial changes to PJ: delete 'W3C's' and add 'Note.' as in: Note. 
Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to the tool automatically generating markup. 
(e.g., PJ: finish sentence and lowercase for 'checkpoint' as in: Note. 
Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to providing equivalent alternative information. 
from PJ: finish sentence and lowercase for 'checkpoint' as in: Note. 
Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to creating structured content and separating it's presentation. 
The section or sections in the techniques document would then have the appropriate information [proposed matrix] about each WCAG checkpoint applicability to that ATAG checkpoint. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins, 2 december  draft was removed) by I believe we should keep my proposed [different from the 2 Dec draft] in the guidelines to improve understanding on the applicability in the conformance section: PJ proposal : Note. 
Some "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guideline" checkpoints may not apply to certain classes of authoring tools. 
The scope of the tool's design dictates whether the requirements of a checkpoint are applicable. 
[A] Some checkpoints require a tool to implement applicable functionality in order for the tool to claims conformance with the checkpoint. 
[Sample conformance evaluations] are provide as example only, and are not necessarily validated or endorsed by W3C. [sample conformance evaluations] would link to ? 
As I read the paragraph again, a "for example" might need to be added, such as: [A] For example, [checking for and alerting the author] about [providing information about the general layout of a site (e.g., a site map or table of contents)] would not be in the scope of all authoring tools. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins, using author assumed the of documentation I would remove much of the paragraph under "relative priority", because it deals more with "applicability". 
"applicability is being covered nicely with each checkpoint and a general paragraph may add to the confusion. 
I would replace both paragraphs about with this one: PJ proposal 1.1[*] : In assigning priority levels for checkpoints, "the author" or user of the tool is assumed to be aware of the language supported, to be a competent, but not necessarily an expert, user of the tool, and to have only a nominal knowledge of accessibility. 
For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the documentation packaged with the tool, but is expected to know how to turn to the integrated help and documentation for assistance. 
[*]I deleted the first sentence and fixed some grammar from my earlier post... Regards, Phill Jenkins,
