Let's try to get consensus on the card within EO today, so that Judy can send it to WAI IG and GL for review asap. 
Changes from version 8: Image Maps Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots. 
goes back to Image Maps Use client-side MAP and text link for hotspots. 
I agree with Charles that it's better to cover both alt text (whether in AREA or in new MAP model) and redundant link text in one sentence. 
Multimedia: Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions when non-W3C inaccessible formats are used. 
Since there is room for clarity, let's try to use it. 
First, let's not equal non-W3C and inaccessible, as the Java 
accessibility effort are real. 
The way Len had phrased it: "accessible version of non accessible formats", it sounds as if we're asking people to use an accessible version of a format, not a page. 
I also think the current wording covers the use of OBJECT (i.e. not necessarily need a separate page). 
We could use "when other inaccessible formats are used" instead of "non-W3C", but since the guidelines mention non-W3C, I think we can use it as well. 
To Alan: HTML is not is only accessible format, in fact, it can be inaccessible, as the other tips prove. 
To Charles: are you really suggesting we use "etc" ? 
Very few people would know what to swap this etc for IMHO. 
We need to be more specific, without including the whole guideline 30 lines of text. 
Watching us working on this, I haven't seen a clear need for numbering the tips, so I removed the counter and just used dot for each tip in this version. 
I think it looks better. 
Tell me what you think. 
Complete version with image of 9 point layout at Let's waicard10 be our last version ! 
1. I was under the impression that we would be updating this card as technology improved. 
If this is actually the case, then we should be using revision numbers. 
I'm not sure you've seen my argument. 
2. I think sometimes "where practical" can be interpreted as "where convenient." 
I vote for leaving "where practical" out. 
How about "wherever possible" ? 
I'm tempted to just drop non-W3C then. 
A few other changes showed up in waicard9 since this morning: - In my local office review here in Sophia, someone told me we should emphasize the word "function" in the Image tip - the same person didn't get the "read out of context" (and he's not a HTML beginner to say the least) so I added back the 'No "Click Here"' piece. 
On the printed layout version... "see the complete guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI" the address is in a san serif font and italics. the "I" in WAI is difficult to tell from a slash or a lower case "L" (my email address has a numeral "1" and it confusing to people when the look at it or write it down) perhaps a font change to something with serif to make the "I" more defined. 
On the 4th bullet "Hypertext links" at the very end No  Click Here  , in the HTML version the "click here" is in quotes. 
I prefer the quotes.
