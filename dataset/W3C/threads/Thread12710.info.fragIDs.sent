<s> Let's try to get consensus on the card within EO today, so that Judy can send it to WAI IG and GL for review asap.  </s>
<s> Changes from version 8: Image Maps Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots.  </s>
<s> goes back to Image Maps Use client-side MAP and text link for hotspots.  </s>
<s> I agree with Charles that it's better to cover both alt text (whether in AREA or in new MAP model) and redundant link text in one sentence.  </s>
<s> Multimedia: Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions when non-W3C inaccessible formats are used.  </s>
<s> Since there is room for clarity, let's try to use it.  </s>

<s> accessibility effort are real.  </s>
<s> The way Len had phrased it: "accessible version of non accessible formats", it sounds as if we're asking people to use an accessible version of a format, not a page.  </s>
<s> I also think the current wording covers the use of OBJECT (i.e. not necessarily need a separate page).  </s>
<s> We could use "when other inaccessible formats are used" instead of "non-W3C", but since the guidelines mention non-W3C, I think we can use it as well.  </s>
<s> To Alan: HTML is not is only accessible format, in fact, it can be inaccessible, as the other tips prove.  </s>
<s> To Charles: are you really suggesting we use "etc" ?  </s>
<s> Very few people would know what to swap this etc for IMHO.  </s>
<s> We need to be more specific, without including the whole guideline 30 lines of text.  </s>
<s> Watching us working on this, I haven't seen a clear need for numbering the tips, so I removed the counter and just used dot for each tip in this version.  </s>
<s> I think it looks better.  </s>
<s> Tell me what you think.  </s>

<s> 1. I was under the impression that we would be updating this card as technology improved.  </s>
<s> If this is actually the case, then we should be using revision numbers.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure you've seen my argument.  </s>
<s> 2. I think sometimes "where practical" can be interpreted as "where convenient."  </s>
<s> I vote for leaving "where practical" out.  </s>
<s> How about "wherever possible" ?  </s>
<s> I'm tempted to just drop non-W3C then.  </s>
<s> A few other changes showed up in waicard9 since this morning: - In my local office review here in Sophia, someone told me we should emphasize the word "function" in the Image tip - the same person didn't get the "read out of context" (and he's not a HTML beginner to say the least) so I added back the 'No "Click Here"' piece.  </s>
<s> On the printed layout version... "see the complete guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI" the address is in a san serif font and italics. the "I" in WAI is difficult to tell from a slash or a lower case "L" (my email address has a numeral "1" and it confusing to people when the look at it or write it down) perhaps a font change to something with serif to make the "I" more defined.  </s>
<s> On the 4th bullet "Hypertext links" at the very end No  Click Here  , in the HTML version the "click here" is in quotes.  </s>
<s> I prefer the quotes.  </s>
