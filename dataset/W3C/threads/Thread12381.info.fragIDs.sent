AUWG, EOWG, 
For Monday, 11 February 2002, AUWG meeting, part of the meeting's agenda 
will concern the EOWG draft resource: 
"Selecting and Using Software for Web Accessibility" 
(FYI this is part of an implementation planning resource, the latest draft of which is at: also viewable in its "collapsed" format (but currently with older content), which will be the first format people arrive at if going to the suite: (Note -- the links &amp; back-links between versions are not up to date) For EOWG members, a reminder that this is a joint meeting with AUWG today, at their regular meeting time, which is: 12:00 p.m.(noon) US Eastern Standard Time Conference number: 2894 The EOWG is interested in AUWG's feedback about the "Selecting and Using Software..." resource. 
EOWG plans to circulate this document shortly for broader feedback.

Couple of comments on the document: 
1. I would like to reference the document, because despite the fact that it 
is only a draft, and that needs to be made clear, I think that it is already 
a useful document covering an important topic. 
Why is it not to be referenced under any circumsatnces? 
2. I don't think it is correct to say that the ATAG reviews are not 
up-to-date, although they may not be in some cases, and may not be complete 
reviews. 
On the other hand I think it is important to point out that these 
reveiws are not intended to be an exhaustive or even a particularly set, and 
are only done by the group for indicative purposes to help in assessing the 
group's own work and important directions to take. 
In other words the group expects these to be accurate, but not exhaustive or 
complete.

it is already a useful document covering an important topic 
This particular cup is WAY more than half full. 
Part of the process should 
be to reveal it forcefully to all Consortium Member reps. 
Companies/institutions like the ones they work for are most of whom we seek to inform. 
Their feedback is vital to the growth of this document which IMO is the most important thing we've done at WAI. 
How can we help them help us "sell" this message? 
The guidelines serve well and the ATAG (and possibly even more so XAG) is 
what will serve our friends/clients best in the immediate future. 
Not to be just a "one-trick pony" I would like to emphasize the importance of getting our audience to serve as our voice in the wider community and begin demanding conformance with our principles by pressuring vendors to create and perhaps more importantly aggressively market systems using universal design accessible/usable notions. 
To do this we may need yet another template: a sort of form-letter/petition that says that as customers of your Web/networding tools products we NEED for said products to conform to these principles. 
This is not only right, it is in many instances all over the world required by law. 
When can we expect to have a tool that enables use by PWD and creates accessible/usable output? 
Love. 
It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious! 
I agree with Charles's second comment: 
complete 
and 
the 
or 
I also think that the point about whether the review is up to date or not is in the review page maintained by ATAG, so EO should just point to it with perhaps a small mention about the purpose that ATAG maintains the list. 
Some additional comments: a. 
One page &amp; 3 columns. 
The 7 guidelines for ATAG should be moved out of the introduction and into the checklist. 
Some of the other introductory 
materials in the later section could be moved into the Into section so the whole document could be collapsed to one page. 
Using a visual one page of information is key to communicating to the masses. 
I believe a 3 column approach would also be helpful here, that of course transforms gracefully to a linear mode. 
b. More graphics. 
Need more graphics or diagrams or something besides so much text. 
EO should be concerned about communications, and pictures are better to communicate with the masses of non-blind web developers and managers. 
The alt text can and should transform to the text-heavy version. 
Besides, the technical stuff is in the guidelines and technique docs and should not be so "technical looking" in the EO materials. 
- for example; the checklist should look like a checklist, not a simple numbered list [1] - another example; use the ATAG icons for types of authoring tools [2]

EOWG had discussed this approach, and felt that if EOWG did not provide some clarification in advance about what to expect when people found the AUWG page, that people would come away frustrated and/or angry. 
This is what our previous experience has been with sending people to the AUWG area to look at reviews; they came back very frustrated. 
So EOWG felt it would be helpful to have some initial clarification in the EOWG documents. 
At the same time, additional clarification in the AUWG document would certainly help also. 
But finally, my impression is that some updating of the AUWG reviews is now happening, and this issue may be less of a concern in the future. 
There was considerable interest in EOWG discussions in having more information to point to in the AUWG area, to the extent possible. 
We had tried not having it in the introduction, and felt that this left the reader with no clear concept of what ATAG was about. 
At the same time, most users of this document would not have the technical capability to evaluate authoring tools against the ATAG guidelines, so it may be self-defeating to make those into a checklist. 
But we can brainstorm various solutions for this concern during the EOWG meeting (today or later). 
Can you explain more how you envision a three-column layout here? 
What in which columns? 
Also, what do you see moving into the intro? 
We've already moved things around a fair amount, so not sure which piece should move where now. 
EOWG will discuss options &amp; see where we get. 
Thanks for the suggestions.

I don't think this problem is about to go away - it would be a major change and very significant amount of work if AUWG was to have a large, up-to-date review section designed to be good as a comparative table on its own. 
I think it is useful to have the explanation on the AUWG page of what the purpose of the page is and why the reviews are the way they are, but I agree with Judy that it is helpful to provide some context information in the EO document itself.
