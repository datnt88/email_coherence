The current draft has "prompt the User to confirm..." Is the requirement to allow the user to require the prompting? 
Is there an issue with cognitive disabilities?

The question is whether it is important that all users be prompted, or that users can be prompted if they require. 
It may in fact be confusing to some users - my observation is that users are confused by the suubmission check that Internet Explorer makes by default (however the submission occurs), in which case it would be important to have the choice.

Was the requirement transmuted from 'allow the user to require this behavior by mode setting' to 'just do it this way' as the result of a deliberative process? 
I did not understand the requirement to be that visual users must forego the Windows-standard behavior, here; but that rather users need protection from this in some interaction modes, notably eyes-free, hence the concept of a mode switch. 
But I have been abset from a lot of the discussions and may not be up to date. 
The mode concept may have been thought too complex to believe users will ever actually use it. 
Or that is my rough take on Chaals's 'cognitive' question.
