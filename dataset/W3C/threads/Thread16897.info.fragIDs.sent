<s> Hi Nina, Had a quick look at the first site which looked OK to me although I personally found some of the text a little confusing.  </s>
<s> I have no idea who or what IBO is for example.  </s>
<s> I also did find the sentence "For use with prospects, clients and IBOs in the United States/Canada only."  </s>
<s> very clear.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's because I'm for the UK but I have never heard prospects in this way and it wasn't immediately clear that it was the site that was "For use" with but I'm being very picky.  </s>
<s> The second site however, http://www.appearancestrategy.com http://www.appearancestrategy.com/ I didn't have so much joy with.  </s>
<s> I use my own stylesheet which sets font size to 14pt (I know, shouldn't use pt in general but this is purely for my own use and I wouldn't use it otherwise!!) and with both IE5.5 and Mozilla the top right links are partially obvscured and are only readable using my powers of deduction.  </s>
<s> It like the right hand side of the words disappear under another "layer".  </s>
<s> Had a quick look at the source and not being a CSS guru couldn't see anything particularly obvious but this looked unusal to me: style="visibility:visible;height:auto;z-index:1;position:absolute;clip:rect( 0,600,auto,0)" Appart from not knowing what clip does I can't see why you would give the div a class and then add more inline styling.  </s>
<s> Why not just stick with one or the other?  </s>
<s> There could be reasons why you might do this though I suppose?  </s>
<s> Also, I did notice that the font-size is set to 12pt which is accepted (as mentioned above) not to be the best units to use.  </s>
<s> The predefined words small, large,...  </s>
<s> I think are the best choice.  </s>
<s> I didn't look at anything else and I only looked briefly at the above but hopefully it will be of some use.  </s>

<s> Hi Nina, A brief look at the first site (http://www.carty-intl.com)  </s>
<s> noted the following: Contrast issues between navigation links and background image; Increasing text size can result in overlap of navigational text-links with text in background image; Avoid beginning all text links on a page with the same word - this means users navigating with a links list are unable to alphabetically jump to an area of interest - begin the link with the most distinguishing information as much as possible.  </s>
<s> (e.g. Feature Product list, all begin with 'new'); Some text size is fixed (e.g. text in search result table); Identical text links to different targets should be avoided (e.g. search result for "baby food" is three text links of 'baby food' that go to different targets); Data tables are not marked up with headers (e.g. search result table); Layout fails in NN 4.7 Lists not marked up as such (e.g. list of 'air treatment product' links have no separator between) Sofia  </s>
<s> Nina, I've taken a quick look at both sites.  </s>
<s> The page looks fine except for the non contrasting link colors at the top.  </s>
<s> When enlarging the font size so I can read it revealed a few things.  </s>
<s> The links flow out of the image t the top and flow into the content earea.  </s>
<s> It also seems that the name of the site and what it delivers is in the image.  </s>
<s> Thereby the links and this text fall together are aren't very readable anymore.  </s>
<s> This could be prevented if the background image of the page is seperated into three areas and made the background for a div tag.  </s>
<s> That is one for the links, one for the name of the site + what is sands for, and one for on the left of the content area.  </s>
<s> The links at the right are a bit difficult to read due the colors choosen.  </s>
<s> When enlargin the font size the links at the right are hidden behind somekind of area, and are not so understandable when you see only the first 3 or 4 characters.  </s>
<s> Also the text of the contents area flows out of the contwents area and starts to overlap the logos and ads at the bottom.  </s>
<s> This could be solved when the content area would streatch itself to be taller.  </s>
<s> This could maybe done using a couple of div tags with a couple of background images.  </s>
<s> But it may require a layout table to be able to keep the same layout.  </s>
