The ERB schedule calls for voting on these Feb. 19th. 
I've take the liberty of grouping a few here that seem totally related. 
2.1.a 
Should we allow link recognition via a reserved attribute? 
2.1.b 
If so, should we generalize this and say that it's an AF? 2.1.c 
If so, should we provide an introduction to AF's? 2.1.d 
If we allow such recognition, what should the attribute be, and what should be the values for each element type we define?

has anyone considered what happens when several arch forms must be applied to the same element type? 
For example, a community wants to use the XML type for a link, but specialize it further with arch forms only a set particular to a community shares? 
The Architectural Forms Definitions Requirement section of the Extended SGML Facilities annex to HyTime will cover this is great detail. 
It provides all the mechanisms you need to differentiate between multiple architectures associated with an element.

Yes. Then the answer to "should we describe arch forms if used" would be, "No.
