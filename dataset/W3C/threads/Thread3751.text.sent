We've discussed with Hugo about a new location for the checklink page currently at http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink . 
The problem with the current location is that AFAICT it's not in a place where I'd be able to update it. 
And to people who don't already know; the main checklink development responsibility has been transferred over to me after discussions with Hugo and Olivier. 
So unless somebody objects, I'll put the checklink doc page in CVS into validator/htdocs/checklink.html. 
When that is publicly available somewhere, eg. deployed on validator.w3.org, we'll redirect the old doc URI to that one. 
I also have some pending work to do, like making it run under mod_perl without trashing the server error log, as well as the entries already in the todo list at http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink#what . 
I hope I'll get to look at those next week.

ville.skytta at iki.fi Ville, We can redirect, or proxy. 
Either will be acceptable. 
When/if you need to change things on the www.w3.org, you can ask me, or (better, to avoir having a single point of failure) this list (where a few team members are). 
Olivier Thereaux - W3C - QA : http://ww.w3.org/QA/ Ok, I'll put the page to CVS as outlined above, then. 
Proxying might not work if (when?) I update the page to take advantage of Validator's SSI things but that's not at the top of my todo list. 
Hmm, ww.w3.org ? 
:) \/ille Skytt? 
ville.skytta at iki.fi What makes you think Proxying won't work? 
Last-Modified? 
That's supposed to work even if this is SSI (that's what XBitHack is for (among other things). 
On a slightly different note, I think it would probably be usefull to integrate checklink and check more on v.w3.org. 
As it is they seem to be two completely different tools despite being linked at the hip in CVS. 
Longer term I still think the brunt of both should be made into modules and let CGI switches decide what gets output froma single CGI application. 
But until we get there, perhaps we could look at integrating the web sites (the *.html files, basically)? 
Combined docs, and perhaps two Submit buttons for the same FORM field ("Check Markup" and "Check Links")?

The SSI mechanism should work just fine when proxied, but I have a hunch that the relative links contained in them, eg. in header.html 
won't, unless practically everything in v.w3.org is proxied. 
Haven't really thought about this too much, but redirection seems more hassle-free to me. 
Sounds good to me. 
Maybe a good start would be to add the checklink doc page into docs/checklink.html 
(maybe it's better under docs/), and adding an entry into docs/index.html. 
I don't currently have a publicly accessible site available for protoing; the new dev box would be very much welcome... \/ille Skytt? 
ville.skytta at iki.fi Agreed. 
As mentioned off-list, I have a box available that I can give you access to to (throwaway Red Hat 8.0 install just used temporarily for smoketesting).
