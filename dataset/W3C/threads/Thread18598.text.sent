Dear UAWG, The W3C Team has just started a four-week W3C Advisory Committee review of a revised UAWG charter [1]. 
The review (rather than simple extension) was necessary since the WG is being rechartered explicitly as a "Royalty-Free Working Group". 
The new charter duration is until 1 May 2003. 
We should be able to continue our work unaffected by this. 
Cheers, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20011218 Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

That is certainly good news for me. 
Will/is RF be part of other WAI recharterings? 
I believe so, yes. 
That's not really a departure from the current charters, just a more formal statement of it in terms of W3C's "Current Patent Practice Note" [1].
