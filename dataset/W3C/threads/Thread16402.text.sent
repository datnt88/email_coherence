An article on wired.com: 
"Not so long ago, Web designers who wanted to create fancy sites with dynamic interfaces had to take a deep breath and code their pop-up menus and glowing menu buttons in Sun's Java. 
"But buggy Java engines, performance problems, and design tools geared toward programmers instead of graphic artists has prompted a mass exodus from Java to a once-obscure format originally intended for animators: Macromedia's Flash." 
The accessibility drawbacks of Flash aren't even touched on, and instead you get the following: "Torrone, a Macromedia partner who sits on the Flash advisory board, is building the first online bank entirely in Flash. 
"You couldn't do a whole bank in Java," Torrone said. 
"It's too unstable. 
There are too many different implementations on different browsers and different platforms. 
It has lower penetration and there are security issues like malicious Java applets. 
Flash is almost foolproof. 
It's just graphics. 
There's no key to the door." 
Anyone else worried about a trend towards an all-Flash web?

At least we won't have to worry about people doing their banking in their car. 
Happy Trails, Mike Wagner Director, Information Technology &amp; Accessibility I find the title of this mail funny. 
Flash has been touted as "The future" for the last two years. 
In reality it has already arrived, and in my opinion, peaked. 
I think Flash is "Like, sooo 1999". 
It is very good for visual designers, and served it's purpose well. 
However, it is quite limited, and authors are looking for more comprehensive tools. 
SVG (scalable vector graphics) is a better standard for Flash-like content. 
It hasn't been adopted yet, but it should be quite accessible, because it is text-based, not binary code like Flash. 
I think Quicktime has a lot more potential, and it's important to make sure Apple know how important accessibility is, so they can build such features into future versions of Quicktime. 
If this is done, it could be a perfect medium for talking books. 
Flash is very prevalent, and that is a worry. 
Authors have to realise that it isn't suitable for everyone, and alternatives should be provided. 
Macromedia has to attack this issue head on as they develop their software. 
Everyone concerned should write to Macromedia and Apple, and demand accessible Quicktime and Flash!
