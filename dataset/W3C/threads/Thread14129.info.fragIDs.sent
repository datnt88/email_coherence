<s> browsers and assistive technologies that do not support frames, then is could be solved by adding "frames" to 6.3 to provide alternative accessible page when frames are not supported, or - removing the phrase "scripts cause changes" from checkpoint 6.5 because it's covered in 6.3.  </s>

<s> Phil, I agree that there is some redundancy.  </s>
<s> I raised a similar issue a couple weeks ago.  </s>
<s> The original intention of this checkpoint was to warn authors about the perils of using images as targets of frames because there is no way to attach alt-text to the image.  </s>
<s> However, that is more of a technique, so we tried to generalize it a bit: "Ensure that the source of each frame is a markup file, such as HTML."  </s>
<s> To make it less HTML-centric frames were generalized into "dynamic content" since the contents of the frame often change.  </s>
<s> I agree that frames could be covered under 6.3.  </s>
<s> A proposed rewording could be as follows.  </s>
<s> Note that the example is also different not only to reflect frames, but to also incorporate discussion from the 4/15 call.  </s>
<s> 6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other dynamic objects are turned off or not supported.  </s>
<s> If this is not possible, provide equivalent information either on an alternative accessible page or within the content of the element.  </s>
<s> A few examples: * An example of an alternative mechanism for an applet simulation is a video recording of someone interacting with the applet simulation.  </s>
<s> * In HTML, use a NOFRAMES element within a FRAMESET.  </s>
<s> * When using JavaScript in an HTML document, do not use "javascript:" as the URI for a link.  </s>
<s> If it is not possible to make the page usable without scripts, provide a text equivalent with the NOSCRIPT element, use a server-side script instead of client-side script, or provide an alternative accessible page.  </s>
<s> Refer also to guideline 1. --wendy  </s>
