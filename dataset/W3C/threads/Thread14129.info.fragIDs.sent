I'm not sure this has been covered in some of the proposed changes. 
6.5 Frames. 
"6.5 Provide an alternative presentation or page when the primary content 
is dynamic (e.g., when frame contents change, when scripts cause changes, etc.). 
" The intent of this checkpoint is not clear as stated and seems to repeat 6.3 In particular, this is in the Frames section of the checklist, yet the reference is to dynamic content. 
If it is specific to frames (not scripts) that change the content of the target frame, then it may not be an "issue" for browsers and assistive technologies that support frames, any more than selecting a link and loading the new page. 
If the issue is related to 
browsers and assistive technologies that do not support frames, then is could be solved by adding "frames" to 6.3 to provide alternative accessible page when frames are not supported, or - removing the phrase "scripts cause changes" from checkpoint 6.5 because it's covered in 6.3.

Phil, I agree that there is some redundancy. 
I raised a similar issue a couple weeks ago. 
The original intention of this checkpoint was to warn authors about the perils of using images as targets of frames because there is no way to attach alt-text to the image. 
However, that is more of a technique, so we tried to generalize it a bit: "Ensure that the source of each frame is a markup file, such as HTML." 
To make it less HTML-centric frames were generalized into "dynamic content" since the contents of the frame often change. 
I agree that frames could be covered under 6.3. 
A proposed rewording could be as follows. 
Note that the example is also different not only to reflect frames, but to also incorporate discussion from the 4/15 call. 
6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other dynamic objects are turned off or not supported. 
If this is not possible, provide equivalent information either on an alternative accessible page or within the content of the element. 
A few examples: * An example of an alternative mechanism for an applet simulation is a video recording of someone interacting with the applet simulation. 
* In HTML, use a NOFRAMES element within a FRAMESET. 
* When using JavaScript in an HTML document, do not use "javascript:" as the URI for a link. 
If it is not possible to make the page usable without scripts, provide a text equivalent with the NOSCRIPT element, use a server-side script instead of client-side script, or provide an alternative accessible page.
