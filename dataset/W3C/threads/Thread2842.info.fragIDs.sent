<s> In my mind, SHOULD and MAY are very close.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the wording looks to me like that for Accept and Accept-Encoding w.r.t. 406 as far as unconditional compliance is concerned.  </s>
<s> And for conditional compliance, servers have the option of sending an "unacceptable response" in place of an error response.  </s>

<s> Comments? - Jim  </s>
<s> Sorry for the slow response - due to a mailing list malfunction, I wasn't getting HTTP-WG messages for a few days.  </s>
<s> In most cases, the 'cachable' constraint is not on whether you store the value in a cache, but whether you USE the cached value.  </s>
<s> Now, it may be foolish to cache something that you cannot use, but perhaps not; e.g., even if the results aren't exactly cachable, could you use delta-coding on the next request with an appropriate entity tag?  </s>
<s> Yes indeed.  </s>
<s> This might be one of the biggest payoffs for delta-encoding, since it allows the "virtual transmission" of a sequence of changing responses without actually sending all of the bits over and over again.  </s>
<s> I don't know whether it's best to say SHOULD NOT and let  </s>
<s> implementors figure out the constraints, or to go ahead and use MUST NOT, but to carefully redefine 'cachable' or 'cached' to mean that the cached value cannot be used,  </s>
<s> and thus probably shouldn't be stored.  </s>
<s> I agree that the term "cachable" may be a poor one to use in a statement of formal requirements.  </s>
<s> But we *do* have the right formal definition in section 1.3: cachable A response is cachable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of the response message for use in answering subsequent requests.  </s>
<s> The rules for determining the cachability of HTTP responses are defined in section 13.  </s>
<s> Even if a resource is cachable, there may be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached copy for a particular request.  </s>
<s> although I'm not sure I would trust every implementor to read and internalize these definitions.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, the folkloric definition of "cachable" (meaning: to store at all in a cache) is a stronger requirement.  </s>
<s> So an implementor who uses the folkloric definition, rather than the formal one, risks losing efficiency but not transparency.  </s>
<s> However, Jim proposed:  </s>
<s> Responses to methods other than GET or HEAD MUST NOT be cached, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields and the verb here ("be cached") is not formally defined in the sense that Larry describes, as far as I know.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest: Responses to methods other than GET or HEAD MUST NOT be treated as "cachable" (by the definition in section 1.3), unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.  </s>
<s> "Responses to methods other than GET or HEAD MUST NOT be cached, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields"  </s>
<s> I believe that the spec makes the above statement somewhere already,  </s>
<s> though I just tried to find it and failed.  </s>
<s> Jeff?  </s>
<s> Hmm. Section 13.4 (Response Cachability) says something vaguely similar, although it might say something wrong: it doesn't mention any methods, but says (in effect) that all status-200 responses are cachable unless otherwise marked.  </s>
<s> Since POST definitely allows a status-200 response and is by default not cachable (section 9.5), this is a contradiction.  </s>
<s> I did a quick search for a statement matching the one that Jim suggests, and didn't find it (which doesn't mean that it isn't there).  </s>
<s> My suggested fix: (1) In 13.4 change:  </s>
<s> Unless specifically constrained by a cache-control (section 14.9) directive, a caching system MAY always store a successful response (see section 13.8) as a cache entry, MAY return it without validation if it is fresh, and MAY return it after successful validation.  </s>

<s> A caching system MUST NOT treat responses to other methods as cachable (by the definition in section 1.3) unless the response includes Cache-Control or Expires header fields implying that the response is cachable.  </s>

<s> This doesn't work with the wording in section 13.11 which I am basing the cache interactions for the M- methods used by the HTTP Extensions Framework on: All methods that might be expected to cause modifications to the origin server's resources MUST be written through to the origin server.  </s>
<s> This currently includes all methods except for GET and HEAD.  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT reply to such a request from a client before having transmitted the request to the inbound server, and having received a corresponding response from the inbound server.  </s>
<s> This does not prevent a proxy cache from sending a 100 (Continue) response before the inbound server has sent its final reply.  </s>
<s> The alternative (known as "write-back" or "copy-back" caching) is not allowed in HTTP/1.1, due to the difficulty of providing consistent updates and the problems arising from server, cache, or network failure prior to  </s>

<s> If the origin server is using an extension that does require write-through, then it shouldn't be sending responses with something like: Cache-control: max-age=12345 which implies cachability.  </s>

<s> True, caches that don't understand the extension will have to validate but on the other hand, if the extension is fully cachable by everyone then it hardly calls for messing with the method name but instead for an optional extension.  </s>

<s> Do we need a vary on the method name?  </s>
<s> The definition in 1.3 doesn't indicate this.  </s>
<s> First of all, the *definition* of "cachable" in 1.3 has nothing to do with the *specification* of what the proxy is supposed to do.  </s>
<s> So I'll ignore that part of your question, rather than trying to guess what you really meant.  </s>
<s> Second, I see what you mean about the need to match the method name, since otherwise I think we're in dangerously undefined territory.  </s>
<s> So I guess that sentence I added should become A caching system MUST NOT treat responses to other methods as cachable (by the definition in section 1.3) unless the response includes Cache-Control or Expires header fields implying that the response is cachable, and the subsequent request uses the same method as the request that generated the response.  </s>
<s> Note that the preceding sentence basically includes the usual exception to the method-matching rule (GET and HEAD "match") with the implicit understanding that a cache can't take a HEAD response and give it back for a new GET request.  </s>

<s> This does not prevent a proxy cache from sending a 100 (Continue) response before the inbound server has sent its final reply.  </s>
<s> Well, I could try to wriggle out of this one, but I admit that this is a little flakey.  </s>
<s> After all, the MUST applies with the precondition "that might be expected to cause modifications", and perhaps it's reasonable that if the cached response with the same method has a non-zero max-age value, then the method shouldn't be expected to cause modifications.  </s>
<s> But the second sentence does contradict this.  </s>
<s> So I would change this to: All requests that might be expected to cause modifications to the origin server's resources MUST be written through to the origin server.  </s>

<s> I don't.  </s>
<s> Since I wasn't involved in writing 5.1.1,  </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether it really meant to say MUST (or if the word "server" here really includes "proxy").  </s>
<s> Anyway, the reason why I don't think this is a good idea is that *if* a response is fully cachable regardless of whether the method is understood or not, then it smell, feels, and looks like a GET request.  </s>
<s> There is absolutely no reason to have several GET-alike methods.  </s>
<s> GET is special because it is special because it is special.  </s>
<s> I think the point is that if an origin server wants to make the response to a FOO cachable, why should we try to forbid it?  </s>
<s> As long as we do it in a way that can't be misconstrued.  </s>
<s> If your origin server doesn't want a proxy to cache a response to a FOO method, then why on earth is it sending "max-age=3600"?  </s>
<s> Just leave that out, and nobody gets hurt.  </s>
<s> But if this is all too much for a last-minute change, then I propose resolving ADAMS31 by not changing anything (relative to -rev-05).  </s>
<s> I started down this path by complaining about Jim's proposed change in and trying to put his words in the right part of the document.  </s>
<s> I suspect we will survive if we just leave this part of -rev-05 alone.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I'm fine with Jeff's updated wording, though I think worrying about the cached entry corresponding to the new request method should be part of the definition of cachable rather than having to repeat the conditional in several places.  </s>

<s> What does bother me is  </s>
<s> which is a bug -- it should say An origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed) if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server.  </s>
