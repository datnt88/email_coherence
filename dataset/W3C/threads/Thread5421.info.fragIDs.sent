There is something terribly wrong with USPTO in regard to software patents. 
I guess I am not saying anything new here. 
The Eolas patent should of never been issued. 
I don't how Microsoft is having such a hard time proving this, but I think I found out why: Here is any another example of a patent that should of never been issued: Microsoft was issued this patent 6,327,617 December 4, 2001 Filing date: April 25, 2000 Method and system for identifying and obtaining computer software from a remote computer Abstract Creators of computer software provide the most up-to-date versions of their computer software on an update service. 
A user who has purchased computer software calls the update service on a periodic basis. 
The update service automatically inventories the user computer to determine what computer software may be out-of-date, and/or need maintenance updates. 
If so desired by the user, the update service computer automatically downloads and installs computer software to the user computer. 
By making periodic calls to the update service, the user always has the most up-to-date computer software immediately available. 
The update service may also alert the user to new products (i.e. including new help files, etc.), and new and enhanced versions of existing products, which can be purchased electronically by a user from the update service. 
Now go to GOOGLE, switch to the groups and do a simple common sense words such as: "Auto Update" and BEHOLD, you will find the following prior arts as far as 1996. 
At least 57,000 hits! 
Our product has been using an Auto Update Program system called the AUP since 1996, and it is probably the only one in the industry that has a successful fee based subscription system tied to it. 
This is a level many software developers would like to get to - the ability to charge monthly for software updates! 
The concept has been in place since 1996! 
It works! 
Thank you very much! 
Microsoft has been in one way or another has been very aware of our WINSERVER product line. 
They know we exist. 
They had us listed back in 1998 as a "Top 100 Windows Application."" 
They told me that. 
I didn't make it up! 
I guess a lot of people our customers call them for tech support! 
Anyway, this is a prime example on how ridiculous the software patent process has become. 
This patent should had of never been issued. 
It is clearly not enforceable!

You'll need to read over the claims section of the Microsoft patent to see what they actually invented.

[chop] 22 of 23 probably means the patent is no good! 
We don't need to put a list of vendors in our AUTOUPDATE system because we are not selling other people software. 
Well, we do but that product becomes another licensed items that is registered to the user when they purchase it. 
It is added to the database and the user will get updates thru the AUP just like all the rest of his registered items. 
But we haven't this for 3rd party developers in a long time because today, they have they own web site update system. 
This patent is silly and non-enforceable. 
As for the rest of the patent, it describes a method using a specific syntax. 
This falls more under a copyright protection. 
This should had never been a patent, but unfortunately the current environment allows it.. Anyway, I'm not worry about it. 
This is technically off topic but it just goes to show that Microsoft is just a bad as the rest of the people they are trying to defend against. 
Sincerely, Hector Santos, CTO Santronics Software, Inc. 305-431-2846 Cell 305-248-3204 Office 
If Microsoft ever chooses to sue anyone over this patent, it sounds like you can be hired as an expert witness to overturn it.
