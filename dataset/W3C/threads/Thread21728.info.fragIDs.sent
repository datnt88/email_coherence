Hi all, I updated my version of the image region vocabulary/doc. 
width and height for regions have been removed, the value syntax for boundingBox is now {x1,y1,width,height}. 
Is the following coords stuff correct: 
A region of type Rectangle uses two pairs of comma-separated integers. 
the 
pairs are separated by a space. 
"0,0 50,100" could for example describe a rectangle that starts in the upper left corner of an image, has a width of 50 pixels and a height of 100 pixels (i.e. the first pair describes the upper left 
corner, the second one the lower right). 
A region of type Circle uses a point (center) and a radius. 
"40,60,20" is a 
valid example (center_x=40, center_y=60, radius=20). 
A Polygon can be described by a list of pairs. 
Each pair consists of two (comma-separated) integers. 
Pairs are separated by a space. 
"0,0 50,0 50,100 0,100" describes the rectangle mentioned above as a polygon. 
The coords value for an Ellipse consists of four comma-separated values. 
In 
this context "40,60,20,15" means: center_x=40, center_y=60, x_radius=20, 
y_radius=15.

Hi Benjamin, thanks for updates. 
I don't think this is the consensus. 
Though there was no clear conclusion, 
I think it's better be {x1,y1 x2,y2} as Rectangle (see bellow). 
[1] 
I think this explanation is confusing re: whether the second pair "50,100" means lower right coordinate, or with/height pair. 
I want it stay the same as we discussed so far, as well as the existing Jim's vocab (where 50,100 is the coordinate of lower bottom corner, rather than width/height pair). 
Maybe example such as "10,20 50,100" is less confusing, and write clearly the latter pair is lower right coord, putting width/height notion into parenthesis ? 
regards, [1]

Thanks for the comments, Masahide. 
I agree. 
I removed the width/height stuff and changed the explanation to A region of type Rectangle uses two pairs of comma-separated integers. 
the 
pairs are separated by a space. 
The first pair describes the upper left, the second one the lower right corner. 
An example coords value for a rectangle is "10,20 50,100" (upper_left_x=10, upper_left_y=20, lower_right_x=50, 
lower_right_y=100). 
oops, ok. 
I asked jim, morten and greg before I changed the doc. 
should I 
change it back again? 
I could live with any syntax. 
another irc meeting required? 
what are the pros/cons, use cases? 
{x1,y1,width,height}: + width and height can easily be extracted - lower right corner has to be calculated + people see that boundingBox != rectangle coords {x1,y1 x2,y2}: + lower right corner can easily be extracted - width and height have to be calculated + same syntax as for rectangle coords can't see a "huge" advantage of any of them.. /me clueless ;)

Benjamin, thank you very much for prompt action. 
New description for Rectangle looks very clear. 
Well, since both Rectangle and BBox are the same type of shape, application 
can reuse the same codes to process them if both use {x1,y1 x2,y2} value. 
But, it's not difficult to process {x1,y1,width,height} value, I'm fine 
with this if there is specific reason to choose this. 
Personally, I don't think another IRC meeting is required. 
Just providing rationale is enough. 
cheers :)

When asked in IRC about which to use for rect, I said x,y,width,height, as that is the natural mechanism for use in SVG, and HTML, so no conversion would be required, I didn't notice that BBox was different, but I would also 
say that should be x,y,h,w since that again is directly usable on the web, 
and it's what API's such as getBBox() of SVG gives. 
It doesn't matter much, both are interchangeable.

ok, I updated the doc. 
both boundingBox and coords for Rectangle now should 
use x,y,width,height. 
I also added some mini inline code examples to the coords doc [1] (thanks for the suggestion, morten). 
(I'm thinking about adding inline image support as well but don't know yet if I will find the 
time for that extension.) 
I'm trying to focus on annotation forms and this 
remote query thing now... 
I have one question left: the basic svg shapes seem to allow float values for coordinates, should I change "integer" to "float" or omit the units in the doc?

I think we should keep it as integer, as originally suggested, to keep the 
format compatible with HTML image maps and the like.

Oh No! I don't care the coords of boundingBox, but do not change syntax of 
that of Rectangle, please!! 
I can't agree to this modification. 
I thought Jim's message only mentioned to BBox...

should 
this 
I'm not even that bothered about it either way, x,y h,w is what I'm happiest with as we don't have to worry about x1 y1 and it naturally follows SVG's elements of the same name - but it's really so insignificant as to be basically irrelevant so please go with what Masahide needs.

(cut) 
SVG 'rect' element uses x, y, widht, height as independent attributes, not put them in one attribute like "10,20,30,40". 
On the other hand, 'points' attribute of SVG 'polygon' or 'polyline' has values in one attribute as "10,20 30,40". 
It depends on point of view which is closer to SVG, IMHO. 
And, I'm not a native English user, but do we call 'x,y,width,height' as coordinate ? 
It's confusing, at least for me.

I think boundingBox should be as simple as possible for parsing: upper left, upper right, width, height. 
I think the rectangle should reflect the polygon or polyline points model, whatever that is.

OK, these are the options I see: a) boundingBox - {x1,y1,width,height} Rectangle.coords - {x1,y1 x2,y2} 
b) boundingBox - {x1,y1 x2,y2} Rectangle.coords - {x1,y1 x2,y2} c) boundingBox - {x1,y1,width,height} Rectangle.coords - {x1,y1,width,height} 
may I suggest that anybody interested sends a short comment to this list to which options he/she can/cannot agree and which he/she would prefer? 
I'm sure we can agree on one of the options above and finally start using this vocabulary... best, benjamin Benjamin Nowack Kruppstr.

hmm, we get the same property naming problem with the syntax of coords for Circle (which has a radius) and Ellipse (x_radius and y_radius). 
do we have to rethink the coords property's name (e.g. change it to "attrs", "facets", "vals", "shapeInfo", ...) or even the whole property (e.g. split it into "x", "y", "points", "radius", ...)? 
I personally like the convenience of having a single property.

I'm not insisting on 'grammatically correct', but just afraid of confusion and misuse. 
Perhaps, coords for circle and ellipse is OK because there isn't much room for misunderstanding. 
But for rectangle or box, 'coords' implies points, not length, thus 'x1,y1 x2,y2', at least for me. 
People quite often use vocabulary, not by consulting spec or schema, but just looking at someone's instance and his/her understanding of the property name. 
This happens for RDFical 'dtend' or ev:enddate, which is defined as 'non inclusive end of event' (i.e. the day after the final date), but many many people use it as the final date of an event. 
That's another reason I insist on using 'x1,y1 x2,y2' for rectangle, along with to retain the syntax of existing vocabulary, e.g. Jim's one or Fotonotes.

Hi, I finally found the time to adjust the doc: Rectangle.coords - {x1,y1 x2,y2} boundingBox - {x1,y1,width,height} I think that's what everyone is fine with.
