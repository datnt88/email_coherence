<s> When I read David's comment below, I noticed the words "tool tip" after TITLE.  </s>
<s> Isn't this just an example of a possible implementation?  </s>
<s> I just want to make sure we don't inadvertently put a "recommendation" in the guidelines that may not belong.  </s>

<s> Sorry to disagree with you, but in my position, I'm very aware of who and who has not implemented Active Accessibility and it's availability.  </s>
<s> Henter-Joyce ships MSAA with each copy of JAWS for Windows, as does Window-Eyes and WinVision, and Window Bridge and DRACULAwin, just to name a few screen readers.  </s>
<s> I'm not including ZoomText, the screen reader/screen magnifier that also ships with Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> Nor am I including the various voice-input and other alternative input or reading aids like Kurzweil 3000 that use MSAA.  </s>
<s> As far as the products that use Active Accessibility, every Office 97 application uses it in some fashion - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook, Project, and even Publisher 98 has it implemented in many areas, including the text of documents.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer 4.01 and Windows 98 ship MSAA implementations to menus including the new Start menu.  </s>
<s> 6.0 versions of Microsoft developer tools, like Visual InterDev 6.0 (currently in beta test) also have MSAA support throughout.  </s>
<s> Microsoft Application Foundation Classes (AFC) implemented MSAA as did it's successor, Windows Foundation Classes.  </s>
<s> So, hopefully this list will change your mind, if not, please reply to me privately.  </s>
