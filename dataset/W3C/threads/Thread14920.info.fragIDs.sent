<s> There are two answers to this question which emerged from today's teleconference: 1.  </s>
<s> Initially, the question of whether 80% or more of informed evaluators would agree, is to be decided hypothetically by the working group: do we think that 8 out of 10 testers familiar with the relevant language/format specification(s), when given the content, would agree on whether or not the checkpoint had been met.  </s>
<s> 2. Later, of course, the issue will be decided by assessing the results of usability testing, in which actual content evaluations will be carried out in application of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Right, The purpose of those qualifiers is just to eliminate having people fail to agree because we picked people who don?t understand what they are doing.  </s>
<s> It is to make it easier to achieve the "objective" label.  </s>
<s> This isn't something that goes into the guidelines by the way.  </s>
<s> It is something we use as part of our testing to see if something does go in, or rather does go in as an objective measure or criteria.  </s>
<s> So we (whomever is doing the testing) will be picking the people.  </s>
<s> We/they just need to pick people who, if they disagree, disagree because the criteria or whatever is ambiguous, not because they don?t understand what the question is.  </s>

<s> If after 80% agreed did anyone propose a "motion to make it unanimous" as happens in most centralized/elitist organizations.  </s>

<s> Bill, Reading back in the thread and the minutes, yes it looks like that definition may need more discussion -- but I'm assuming that's why Gregg put it out there.  </s>
<s> Seems like a thorny issue to figure out.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what other approach would work better, but suggestions are welcome.  </s>
<s> Looks like WCAG WG is trying to set up a re-usable process for making determinations on testing questions not yet on the table.  </s>
<s> The crux of the definition might be who's considered an expert.  </s>
<s> Charles suggested that, and so did you.  </s>
<s> Maybe that's the part of the definition that needs the most work -- in reading it, I assumed that it would include people with disabilities who have need for the accommodation in a specific technique -- plus some knowledge of how it can be tested for.  </s>
<s> But it's not spelled out, and other people might make different assumptions about who's intended.  </s>
<s> The wording in the draft definition says "people who have knowledge of the relevant tech and test methods" which is open to different interpretations.  </s>
<s> One commenter in the minutes suggests "professional" which sounds quite exclusive, but that didn't make it into the draft definition.  </s>
<s> Another flavor I get from the minutes is "technology experts" but again that didn't make it into the draft definition.  </s>
<s> What do you think about "including people with disabilities who have need for the accommodation in a specific technique -- and some knowledge of how it is tested for"?  </s>
<s> Or other ideas?  </s>
<s> Or a diferent approach to addressing this issue?  </s>
<s> If you want to unsubscribe, you can send a message to w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org with "unsubscribe" as the subject line.  </s>

<s> So 80% of people, who meet subjective criteria for inclusion, then make subjective determinations, and if they happen to agree, we label this "objective"?  </s>

<s> I don't think it is useful for us to do a hypothetical assessment - I would prefer that we assume for now that we don't know, but that we don't have sufficient grounds to accept or reject something based on how well the requirement is specified (as opposed to whether it deals with something that is an accessibility requirement) until we have done the testing.  </s>
