James Clark .. has proposed to solve this (and other RE related problems) by abolishing mixed content for XML. 
I think that is an excellent idea. 
If we finesse the RS/RE using the Durand/Nicol trick (which seems like a pretty trouble-free win), then (and this is a serious question) are there remaining big problems with mixed content? 
Because if not, I'd hate to lose it... it is certainly natural to use in declaring, e.g., paragraphs with references or images or a href="http://www.w3.org/" hyperlinks /a .

Your "mixed content" paragraph is easily represented by using explicit sub-paragraph elements (or, as HyTime calls them, "pseudo-elements"), viz: I understand how RS and RE characters can be excluded from XML. 
What I don't understand is whether, under those circumstances the following two cases will cause identical data to be passed to the application. 
If not, what data character codes are passed to the application in each case? 
Case 1: Text of p. Case 2: With the "no mixed content" rule, RS and RE could be confined to element content (that is, between elements) where they would always be ignored; they would never occur in data.

We could (if it is so desired) make it an application convention to strip leading and trailing whitespace. 
Thanks Gavin. 
That's what I feared, so eliminating RE and RS characters doesn't really solve the problem. 
Making it an "application convention" to strip some whitespace just shifts the burden from a few parsers to all applications and increases the chance of inconsistent treatment. 
Better, I think, to eliminate mixed content altogether as James Clark has proposed.
