<s> We would like to give you all until this Friday (19 April) to review.  </s>
<s> If there are no objections, this will be incorporated into a new draft of the Requirements and we will aim to publish to TR early next week.  </s>

<s> While the WCAG WG does not set policy, harmonization of accessibility requirements helps drive demand for supporting implementations in Web applications; therefore it should be easy for policy makers and individuals responsible for implementing policy to understand, cite and/or adopt WCAG 2.0 and related deliverables.  </s>

<s> i agree with your critique, but would like to "see" a more explicit "round-tripping" -- while the buck may stop at the desk of a policy maker, accessibility is achieved not with a single stroke of a bureaucratic pen, but by technicians -- a concept that can neither be lost nor diluted...  </s>

<s> I actually like Gregory's phrtasing, and wonder whether we can make a new re-unified R1 proposal, along the lines of The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users with disabilities.  </s>
<s> However, the users of WCAG 2.0 are a wide audience, and the requirements it expresses these must be expressed in language that policy makers can use, reference and directly adopt as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Which brings me to another point.  </s>
<s> In order to meet this requirement, we need some clear guidance about what language is appropriate for the various policy-setting audiences.  </s>
