<s> In an attempt to determine what would happen if we extended the 'DAV:resourcetype', I tried WebFolders (vintage Win2000Pro 5SP1) against a server that answered a variety of values for resource type.  </s>

<s> For example, I tried the following combo, and the resource shows up as a folder.  </s>
<s> I also tried 'extending' collection as follows: and and they seemed to work ok (i.e., were interpreted as WebFolders and could be opened and browsed, etc.).  </s>

<s> So does this mean we can extend DAV:resourcetype with nested content?  </s>
<s> This sould simplify some of the resource types introduced by versioning.  </s>

<s> This reinforces the direction we had been pursuing of not using DAV:resourcetype for too much.  </s>
<s> For example, using it to indicate whether or not a resource is a principal would mean that even non- collection principals would show up as folders in WebFolders, which is not good.  </s>
