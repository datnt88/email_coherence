<s> It's vitally important to follow the HTML standards when designing for accessibility -- if just because at least that gives the user agent creators and page authors a 'common target' to shoot for.  </s>
<s> Part of following the standards involves including an appropriate DOCTYPE, so people know which standards you _are_ following.  </s>
<s> For accessible web design, it's best to use HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> 4.0 Strict if you can manage it, but Transitional works too, assuming you are working hard to make sure the page _is_ accessible.  </s>
<s> HTML 3.2 is an alternative, not the preferred one, but with other accessibility considerations, it works decently enough.  </s>
<s> To comply with those standards, you need to include a DOCTYPE statement.  </s>
<s> Beyond that, it's useful because then you can run it through validators such as the W3C's at http://validator.w3.org/ to check if your document is actually marked up with valid HTML.  </s>
<s> As XML becomes used even more, it's important to understand the concept behind DOCTYPE, as creator-selectable extended languages come into play.  </s>
<s> Understanding SGML, or the concepts behind it, is also useful.  </s>
