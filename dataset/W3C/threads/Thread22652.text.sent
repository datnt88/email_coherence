hi Van, the best is to down load apache dom parsers from www.xml.apache.org/xerces-j and look at the examples provided along with the parsers,which would really help. 
along with are provided the explanations for the examples Regards, sridhar Hi there, I am new in the HTML, DHTML, XML, DOM etc. 
I recently studied HTML and DHTML and learned about the DOM at very high level. 
Now I want to skill myself to start using the DOM in practice. 
There is so much information on the W3C.ORG site that I really don't know where to start. 
I am currently looking for some very good books, reference manuals on DOM objects, their functionalities, methods, properties and behaviours. 
Maybe somebody can help me by sending me some references (as ISBN numbers etc.). 
I appreciate any help on this. 
Best regards, Patrick 1)Can we create a DOM using just a dtd(with default values in it) and if so how? or 2)Can we create an XML file using just a dtd(with default values in it) and if so how? 
I want the re-use this DOM or XML file to add new values and elements to them later. 
I appreciate your answers. 
Thanks, Andrew Van, Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible, 3rd edition (ISBN: 0764531883) covers the DOM. 
I personally learned it via the specs. 
They really are easy to follow, but to each there own.

Not yet. 
DOM Level 2 doesn't model most of the DTD. 
DOM Level 3's "Abstract Schema" chapter is intended to adress that area. 
Some parsers have custom solutions that they've built for use in the meantime. 
There are certainly DTD-directed XML editors, which seem to be what you're looking for. 
1)Can we create an empty XML file using just a dtd(with default values in it) and if so how? 
So that I can use the XML file to add required/actual values and new elements later. 
I appreciate your response. 
Thanks, Andrew I would appreciate if any one has a answer here to Andrew's question.
