<s> How to implement such properties on interfaces?  </s>
<s> What is standard de facto for implementation of that?  </s>
<s> As Java does, ::getXXX() and ::setXXX() is the answer?  </s>

<s> Best regard, kz.  </s>
<s> See the standard Java and Javascript bindings included with the DOM spec (and the non-standardized bindings available from other sources) for specific examples of how the abstract IDL concepts of "interface" and "property" are typically converted into actual callable APIs.  </s>
<s> Generally, an interface maps to whatever the specific language offers as a completely abstract class/interface/object-API.  </s>
<s> If the language can't offer that, the binding has to come up with some equivalent way to reference the objects.  </s>
<s> Generally, a property will be mapped to a getter method, a setter method, or both... but it may map to field access in some bindings.  </s>
<s> Again, this depends on the characteristics of the language you're developing the binding for.  </s>

<s> It is generally up to the binding creator, not the implementor, to follow the rules of the binding when doing this sort of thing.  </s>
<s> In the case of Java, this means using a getter and setter.  </s>
<s> In the case of ECMAScript, this typically is exposed as a real attribute.  </s>
<s> When creating other bindings, the creator should use whatever is natural for the binding.  </s>
