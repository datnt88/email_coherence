<s> After having upgraded to Amaya 5.0 I experience problems with the validation of a HTML file an error: *** Errors/warnings in /home/reccmo/Musik2/GMD/ick-style.css line 8: CSS value ignored: none This line is found in a css style sheet ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/ick-style.css referenced by the HTML file.  </s>
<s> If I ignore the error and continue with externally editing and reloading the file the indentation gets in a hopeless mess:-( I don't get the error message with the previous Amaya release, and tidy doesn't complain either when I let it parse the file in question.  </s>

<s> The suppression of bullets did not happen in last version but no error was flagged.  </s>
<s> It should not be an error but maybe they are now issuing warnings on unimplemented functions such as a few that are outside the css1 core.  </s>
<s> But this is not outside core just unimplemented.  </s>

<s> In that case Amaya doesn't report an error in your file.  </s>
<s> It only informs you that it doesn't interpret that CSS rule.  </s>
<s> This is new feature with the release 5.0.  </s>
<s> What "small change" have you done?  </s>
<s> The Amaya formatting is broken by the comment between the dt element and the dd element.  </s>
<s> We'll check how to fix it.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> This bug was caused by the comment within the dl element.  </s>
<s> The correction is available in the CVS version and we'll publish a new release next week.  </s>
