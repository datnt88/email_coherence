Using Amaya 3.0 to go to: I get mostly white text on a white background :-). 
I usually use white on black for clarity and glare reduction. 
The main Amaya page doesn't have this problem. 
If this page could be fixed, I'd be grateful. 
Thank you Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk Ok. 
It's done. 
Irene. 
Thank you for your prompt service :-). 
3.1 seems to have build successfully under Solaris2.5.1 from sources. 
I have yet to try it.
