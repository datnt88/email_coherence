<s> Hi all, I'm using a-prompt to test a page that has nested tables.  </s>
<s> I'm looking to  </s>
<s> see what the recommended techniques are in ERT.  </s>
<s> All I see is a link to  </s>
<s> Michael Cooper's comment [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/issues52.htm].  </s>
<s> I don't have a good solution, but it seems that a non-HTML aware user  </s>
<s> should be able to associate the nested table with the appropriate  </s>
<s> headers/rows from the parent table.  </s>
<s> Dream: When a user of a WYSIWYG decides to insert a table into a page.  </s>
<s> They are  </s>
<s> asked, "what will this table be used for? is it a table of data or is it  </s>
<s> to position images and text on the page?"  </s>
<s> Depending on what the user selects, they are lead through a series of questions to get the appropriate  </s>
<s> information from them.  </s>
<s> The whole nested tables section of this would be interesting.  </s>
<s> I haven't  </s>
<s> thought much about how it would work.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>
<s> We really haven't discussed the repair of tables yet and it's going to be a  </s>
<s> big issue.  </s>
<s> Can we try to finish off the BLINK/MARQUEE before moving on?  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> appropriate  </s>
<s> certainly - we can finish up blink and marquee first.  </s>
<s> I just want to get my  </s>
<s> thoughts out there.  </s>
<s> We can check it off as an open issue and come back to it later.  </s>
<s> Just curious - I thought we were going through the document in order.  </s>
<s> Are there other checkpoints that have been skipped?  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>
<s> Each technique in the ERT has a 'Discussion Status' field that tells whether we have discussed the technique on the list or not.  </s>
<s> Most of the techniques are 'awaiting discussion' and the ones that have been discussed are labeled 'under discussion'.  </s>
<s> We are not going through the document in order of technique.  </s>
<s> We started discussing techniques that were thought to be easy to reach agreement on in the hope that we could quickly get through a large number of techniques.  </s>
<s> This strategy hasn't been entirely successful because even the 'easy' techniques still require a significant discussion.  </s>
