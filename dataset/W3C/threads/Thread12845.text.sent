The original suggestion (posted January 5, 2001) was to add a paragraph to the scenario entitled: "Classroom student with dyslexia" This addition would bring mention of the checkpoint on changes in natural language into the example. 
This would be extremely useful for officially multilingual countries like Canada. 
I haven't given much thought to a seamless integration, but the following might fit in as the third, fourth or fifth paragraph: [begin addition] As she was growing up, her family had postings in several countries and she has picked up a working knowledge of several languages. 
Because changes in natural language have been identified in the page markup, her multilingual screen reader automatically switches vocabulary and pronunciation dictionaries, significantly improving her understanding of the pages being read. 
As well, for languages she does not understand, the same markup permits faster and more efficient automatic language translation. 
[end addition] I grant that this would make for a long scenario: most others are three or four paragraphs. 
However, the "Teenager with deaf-blindness, seeking entertainment" scenario is five paragraphs. 
Rather than get hung up on length, I suggest we concentrate on completeness. 
Regards, Chuck Letourneau I recently visited http://www.ld.org, could anyone advise me how well regarded this site is. 
It is the site for the "National Center for Learning Disabilities" and boldly states: 'Individuals with learning disabilities are generally of average or above average intelligence.' 
Is there a language problem here?

This quote was a subject of debate on the Dyslexia list a few months ago: See the archive of the discussion: I'm not sure if you can categorize this site re: whether it is well regarded, or not, since there is helpful info. 
on many sites, even when they make mistakes, or statements not backed up by empirical data. 
But clearly they mixed apples and oranges when trying to categorize those with learning disabilities on an intelligence scale. 
without regard to research...and the discussion caught them on this. 
I have found some of the info. 
on this site useful, and ignore other info.

I am glad to find a response, and hope that we might widen the discussion, the language problem is common enough to english. 
As I understand it, in the UK: SpLD refers to specific learning difficulties which include dyslexia(many are of above average intelligence). 
SLD or severe learning disability would include 'Downs' syndrome, and would not be expected to have above average intelligence. 
Many clients are unhappy with this label, and prefer learning difficulty(the severe is not helpful). 
These terms are very flexible, and are not universal at all.
