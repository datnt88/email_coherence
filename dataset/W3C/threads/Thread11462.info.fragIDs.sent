<s> Hello translators, Martin, Stefan, XHTML Basic in Russian is available at: (including text-only, zip, and gzip'ed tar versions, missing Postscript and PDF versions) The list of terms/abbreviations/acronyms is located at:  </s>
<s> The above-mentioned list is linked from the spec itself and included into zip and gzip archives (I specified that it's not a part of the spec).  </s>
<s> The glossary also includes the acknowledgments section where you can find out how many people were bothered by me.  </s>
<s> See: I used the following techniques to handle names and acronyms (already discussed on the list): 1) The first appearance of every name is followed by its original form in English; 2) The first appearance of important abbrs/acronyms is followed by Russian explanation; 3) Every acronym and abbreviation is inluded into the glossary.  </s>
<s> Martin, could you check the disclosure about the only normative version, etc.?  </s>
<s> Is it ok not to have it in the header but just after the copyright notice?  </s>
<s> Best wishes.  </s>

<s> Hello Alex, Many thanks for your translation.  </s>
<s> This is very nice.  </s>
<s> I think this last part is not done sufficiently clearly.  </s>
<s> The page definitely should not have the W3C Recommendation logo on the upper right corner.  </s>
<s> And the title should be reversed,  </s>
<s> or so.  </s>
<s> Having it after the copyright isn't the best solution, but it's okay.  </s>
<s> By the way, most of the Cyrillic letters at the top of the glossary look like links but don't go anywhere.  </s>
<s> That may be confusing.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello translators, Martin, sorry for the delay.  </s>
<s> Do you mean the upper left corner?  </s>
<s> That was my fault.  </s>
<s> I've included 'style="background-image: none"' for the body element.  </s>
<s> I'm not introducing a new stylesheet in order not to add extra files to gzip/zip.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I removed the dead links, thanks for pointing this out.  </s>
<s> The zip and gzip are updated.  </s>
<s> Thanks again!  </s>
