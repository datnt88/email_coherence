<s> I asked about the card - he said: I can't see how we could fit the stamp/address idea, especially seeing as the address and stamp would be on the right and the message written on the left - doesn't leave anywhere for the text.  </s>
<s> so - sadly - no....  </s>
<s> Libby  </s>
<s> Oh. Leave the title at the top, but small enough not to overrun the stamp.  </s>
<s> Then shrink the rest of the text to take about 1/4 of the card so there is room for a cople of lines that go all the way across the top, under the title and stamp, plus space on the right for an address under that.  </s>
<s> Oh well.  </s>
