<s> Looking into all this messages/issues wrt rdf:XMLLiteral I would second a proposal to change the semantics in the way that lang tags in rdf:XMLLiteral-typed literals would be ignored by the semantics and reflect that in the testcase which would then become a rtest:PositiveEntailmentTest i.e. eg:foo eg:bar "chat"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral. entails eg:foo eg:bar "chat"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral. I've tested that with a test implementation and also made a bug correction so that :aaa :ppp "sss".  </s>
<s> :aaa :ppp _:x.  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:type rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> As far as I've been able to read/test it, I agree with the other changes Pat made in the MT which is an impressive piece of work!  </s>

<s> If lang tags in rdf:XMLLiteral typed literals are to be ignored, then why would we preserve them in the graph for *any* of the typed literals?  </s>
<s> If it is in fact decided that the entailment below is valid and reflected by the MT, then let's just nuke the lang tags from typed literals.  </s>
