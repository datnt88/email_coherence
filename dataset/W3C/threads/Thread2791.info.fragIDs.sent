<s> Has anyone ever considered that it would be useful to be able to add an optionnal 'offset' parameter to the GET request ?  </s>
<s> This would, for example, allow the implentation of very simple video and audio servers using just the http protocol (i.e. the media server would just be the http server).  </s>
<s> Currently the only feature missing to do that is the inability to 'seek' in an object (i.e. requesting the object starting at an offset which is not always 0).  </s>
<s> By the way, the same comments applies to the FTP protocol, too.  </s>
<s> If you have comments on that, please send Cc to me (tristan@mpegtv.com).  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> This feature already exists in HTTP/1.1 See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068 14.36.2 Range Retrieval Requests 14.35.1 Byte Ranges or more generally, search for the word "range" in the text to find related subjects.  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Now I see how to do a GET with range request.  </s>
<s> Now, another question: Is there a way to specify the offset or range with the http: URL syntax ?  </s>
<s> i.e. something like http://host/dir/file@range=0,500  </s>
<s> -t  </s>
<s> There is no provision in HTTP to do this.  </s>
<s> However, some servers have the built-in capability and you could do it using a CGI script with any server.  </s>
<s> An early version of the the byterange specification did not use a header and put the range request in the URL.  </s>
<s> There are pros and cons for URL vs. header.  </s>
<s> In the end it was deemed that a header was best.  </s>
<s> However, one of the cons is that you loose a lot of functionality by not allowing a range specification in the URL.  </s>
<s> Of course any server is free to do it in a non-standard way and, as mentioned above it can be done with CGI.  </s>
