Hi, I checkout Amaya and libwww from CVS repository with winCVS 1.2; I try to compile Amaya. 
I generated files *.h and *.def by running Perl script, then I build compilers.dsw 
and Thot. 
But I cannot open amaya.dsw. 
How can I sort it out? 
Thanks.

Yes, but it open compilers.dsw 
yet.

il metodo pi? semplice per condividere e stampare le tue foto: In the CVS version things changed. 
Now you can directly open amaya.dsw and select the project compilers. 
When compilers are built a window is displayed. 
You just have to build schemas by F7. 
When all schemas are compiled you can close the window and move to the project amaya and build the application. 
The advantage is to keep the same working space for compilers and the application amaya. 
We'd like to link the end of the schemas compiling with the building of Amaya (it's trivial with Unix Makefiles) but we didn't find out a method to do that with Visual Studio. 
Irene.
