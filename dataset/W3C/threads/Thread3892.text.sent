In a nutshell... (I'm one of the co-chairs of the WG, Jaap Akkerhuis is the other, but I am not an implementor of the protocol.) Please note that I took "public-p3p-spec@w3.org" off the cc list - to avoid cross-posting and I'm not on that list. 
If anyone wants to forward this message to that list, you have my permission. 
1. Did you find anything particularly troublesome with adapting P3P to your context from a protocol/binding position? 
(I assume not, you just include P3P in your XML.) Do you have any scenarios where your XML application would also be transported over HTTP, which itself could conceivable have a P3P policy? 
(Or is this an unlikely scenario?) 
Not that I am aware of - trouble with adapting P3P, that is. 
On HTTP - one of the items in our charter has been to investigate "other transports" with "other" meaning "not TCP" in the context. 
But to date, there's been no sustained interest in pursuing any transport other than TCP (with TLS) but multiple members of the WG. 
It's not so much that HTTP was rejected, no one suggested doing it. 
2. What led you to make the changes to the vocabulary that you did? 
(Some terms are removed, some are altered -- we're these casual changes or did you have significant market/policy tensions in your app context?) To some extent because our protocol is "business to business" and constrained in it's reach, as opposed to being "person to business" and in general use. 
3. Your XML app does use schema, did you give any thought to actually using elements from the P3P namespace and if so, what discouraged that? 
I'd have to research that. 
4. Do you have any other feedback that I've missed? 
smile/ None, other than to say that I thought the P3P specification is well written and organized, especially from the perspective of someone who has written specifications in the past. 
I like having the requirement clearly stated and then use prose to convey the spirit. 
Edward Lewis +1-703-227-9854 ARIN Research Engineer I've had it with world domination. 
The maintenance fees are too high. 
Scott and Edward, thanks for your response! 
While cross-listing is generally bad, I'm including w3c list in the cc because this is definitely a substantive in-scope issue for us, and since you guys didn't remove provreg I assume you thought it relevant there too Understood. 
And as Scott said, it was a question of operational experience. 
However, since we, in the P3P context, are trying to figure out how to promote reuse, mind if I follow up on that? 
For instance, if we come to understanding of which parts folks keep, and which parts get dropped or modified depending on the context, perhaps we can provide guidance and better structures. 
I've included a table comparing P3P XML, Compact, and EPP with the following characterization of changes: ACCESS EPP uses a epp:null whereas p3p has a related p3p:nonident. 
epp:null means that only transient data was collected, but p3p:nonident is still a valid description of that, particular when used with p3p:no-retention is used. 
In this case, I'd recommend EPP converge with p3p:noident and support p3p:no-retention since the separation of those two axes is cleaner. 
DISPUTES EPP doesn't support how a dispute can be addressed. 
Is this because in P3P this is a representation to the consumer, and EPP isn't B2C? 
Is the regulatoriness smile/ of it too scary? 
I'll also note the P3P Compact Syntax collapses this all into a DSP token with no p3p:{service, independent, court, law}. 
REMEDIES EPP doesn't support this, see question in DISPUTES. 
NON-IDENTIFIABLE EPP doesn't support this, not sure why. 
PURPOSE EPP supports p3p:{admin, contact, other} and epp:prov. 
I can see the PURPOSE varying widely across application contexts and I think it makes sense to drop and extend from this axes as appropriate. 
REQUIRED No ability designate whether data is required, opt-in, and opt-out. 
Again, probably because EPP is not B2C? RETENTION See ACCESS. 
I recommend you support "no-retention" and then both P3P and EPP will still sync up on these two axes. 
Joseph, There is an implementation. 
The vocabulary element(s) in the EPP schema which correspond to the ACCESS element are not identical to those in the P3P schema. 
p3p:nonident - does not collect identified data epp:null - data is not persistent The problem-domains are not identical. 
P3P is concerned with "initial data collection", EPP is concerned with "onward transport" of data previously collected. 
Comment: Data that moves from one onward-transport node to another may not be persistent on any particular node. 
In particular, a registry could sink part of a data flow (technical data) and discard part of a data flow (social data). 
There is no vocabulary element(s) in the EPP schema which correspond to the DISPUTES-GROUP element, and its child DISPUTES elements. 
No requirement in the problem-domain exists. 
Comment: There is a regulatory regime that is controlling for a class of operators, hence of implementors. 
There is the complement to that class, which lacks an equivalent single regulatory regime, and may be particular to each element in that class (ccTLD operators). 
There is yet another class for which little activity is present (non-tld operators, non-dns operators, and non-IANA root dns operatos, if any). 
See above. 
The problem-domains are not identical. 
The comment is not clear. 
(N.B. 
An optional child element of PURPOSE. 
EBW) 1. 
No requirement in the problem-domain exists for users. 
2. No requirement statement for data in the problem-domain is optional. 
See above. 
I hope this has helped. 
Now for something ... individual. 
I advocated the dcp construct for this problem domain, because I thought it the best mechanism to policy the data, and to allow scoped policies. 
I've tried to kill whois:43 by several means, stealth, poision, very blunt instruments (my wit), etc. 
Others reject the notion that a protocol with a fixed grammer targeting a particular application domain, in particular data collection, is of the slightest use in this problem domain, and insist upon mechanism(s) that support registrant ("user" in p3p usage) defined access et al models. 
As "others" are the IESG, looking at what bits of a data collection vocab are substantially similar, or dissimilar, across problem domains, may not be the best use of anyone's time. 
I hope this has helped too. 
Eric P.S. It might help to keep things in focus to recall every now and again just how much, or little, anyone actually pays for "privacy". 
Indirect cost recovery models for the internet may be ... historic. 
On Monday 07 April 2003 20:27, Eric Brunner-Williams in Portland Maine If the initial data collection had a particular policy (P3P) wouldn't it be best to pass on the initial P3P agreed to, with the data, when it is distributed to those with the "same" policies? 
Let me back way up and ask what data is involved here? 
Was there a usage scenario? 
(Didn't see one, but I expect its clear to those involved with provreg, of which I'm mostly ignorant.) 
I was presuming, as you said, that the data was initially collected by a registrar and then shared with a registry. 
So for instance: https://www.gandi.net/whois?l=EN&amp;domain=w3.org contains personally identifiable data. 
My (continued) presumption was that the registrar, Gandi, might have a policy associated with the collection of this information. 
Now, Gandi might also share this with a .org 
TLD registry data base. 
So in it's initial create it would see the registry greeting and note its dcp (policy). 
If this didn't match the data it collected it under, then it might not upload the information if it said p3p:same, or it might if it said p3p:other-recipient. 
(In the first case, it's more likely to say p3p:public since whois is public, or at least to set its privacy policy based on the policies it knows it must interact with on the back end.) However, my scenario, which is probably incorrect, fails to predict the variances in EPP. 
I didn't follow this bit. 
Sheesh, okay EBW, "no one suggested doing it - on our mailing list." 
;) ;) Granted, I had prior general knowledge, but it did leak into PROVREG, via its principle implementor.

Precedence: bulk At the DNR-forum at RIPE-44 last week, the polish registry presented their implementation of EPP. 
On a related note: Our presentation from monday's Centr workshop are online as well. 
You can get the .ppt 
files (and the latest source code tarballs) from Let me clarify a bit about this. 
At the first day of RIPE meetings there is usually a CENTR technical meeting. 
This time, the afternoon was devoted to EPP. SInce the meeting is limited to CENTR members and invitees (Scott Hollenbeck was there, among others) I don't feel comfortable about quoting from that, although often the meeting minutes are published on the CENTR website. 
Anyway, Otmar Lendl on behalf of the Austrian registry, presented at the centr-tech meeting an implementation of an EPP server as a mod_epp Apache module. 
It is nice to see that this is actually public information. 
For details, see the URL he mentions. 
jaap ------- End of Forwarded Messages This may be a theory-of-foo bump, or it may be a slow moving armidillo, but data originates at a registrar. 
We (epp-hat==1) aren't designing the registrar's UI. 
This is an aside, but (you asked for it). 
A party interposes on the data flow between source and sink, and edits the data. 
Is policy unaffected by the transform? 
I gave this a lot of thought before, and after, the joint WAPF/W3C meeting in Munich (Dec 1999), and concluded that proof of closure was not trivial. 
For the IETFers, take a look at any of the three cache BoF/WGs that came out two years ago -- there was a reason why Mark Nottingham (co-chair, WEBI) attended our f2f at IETF-51 (London), and it wasn't just because we were then both contributors to the W3C's P3P Spec WG. Of these, only Leslie's considered the possibility that cached content was policied (in an IRTF-IDRM-esque fashion) before it was transformed for edge device delivery. 
For the P3Pers, consider a nice bit of html with a nice p3p statement in the usual WKL. 
It is accessed via a WAP device, and transformed by some WAP content management cache for "last mile" lower bandwidth link reasons, and additional operator policy goals ("walled garden"). 
How does an user's p3p evaluation engine evaluate the delivered p3p statement(s)? 
Anyway, we don't know that there was a p3p statement when the data was initially collected by the agent/reseller/registrar. 
What we do know is that a registrar is surrendering, and possibly retaining, data, and a registry is collecting, and possibly discarding, data. 
when it is distributed to those with the "same" policies? 
But it isn't. 
There are several adminstrative or jurisdictional policies that the registrar-collected data might be provisioned (onward-transported) to, and the registries may be unable, under the distinct operational and/or policy regimes they operate under, to accept some registrar-collected data, regardless of the policy under which that data was collected. 
Assume no one has any use for 95/46/ec, or the OECD Guidelines, or the FTC rule-of-the-day (generally, policy on collectors), and only wants raw read and write access on the registries, and a trap on read-requests by other, to interpose a write (or its static equivalent, some sort of mask), for a registrant (user), and/or his/her cluefull agency. 
Now (epp-hat==1) and (p3p-hat==1) are very, very far apart. 
Sailing on different currents altogether, and diverging too. 
Fortunately, this [1] shows that the problem is minor. 
Also, the ICANN Registrars may be limiting whois (both bulk and :43) more effectively than we (PROVREG +/- IESG) are. 
Cheers, Eric [1] http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.pdf 
On Friday 11 April 2003 06:20, Eric Brunner-Williams in Portland Maine So is the information covered is not my data (my contact info I've placed with the registrar) but the registrars information? 
I continue to fail to understand exactly what information the practice applies to and governs. 
I suspect a step-by-step scenario would be immensely useful. 
We have some rules, things like delete-object-before-create-object returns an error. 
What we don't have rule about are where registrars go to get "data", they could just be making it up. 
There is no in-band mechanism to distinguish "registrar-generated-data" from "entity-other-than-registrar-generated-data". 
There is a data collection policy announcement from a data collector, which is indifferent as to the originator of the data which it collects, and it is possible that a registrar might use non-fictive data. 
Did the registrar use P3P when collecting the data? 
I've no idea. 
I don't even know if the registrar was the initial data collector, or if the initial data collector was a reseller and the registrar engaged in onward-transport. 
I don't know how the data got to the registrar. 
What the dcp covers is _everything_ in a session. 
Since sessions exhaust, for the time being, the semantics of state exchange between registrars and registries, everything collected by a registry is policied. 
Note that any registry may have a number other than one of applicable dcp statements, with non-overlapping session-scope. 
Eric
