The enclosed is a rewrite and augmentation of the material on tables from the UA guidelines of 19980814, subsections 4.6 and 6.5. 
In the htm, I have used emphasis around some text changes. 
I have redone and shortened the table examples, so they are new. 
I may not have done enough with spanning TH cells, only a note. 
Regards/Harvey Bingham 
Thanks for your work Harvey, I will try to get these updates into the guidelines this week.

Perhaps, we could use the tables from the guidelines group for our different table renderings.
