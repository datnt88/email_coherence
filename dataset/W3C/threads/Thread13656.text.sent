To the people of WCAG, Many sites use small buttons, menus or tabs that have text as images, e.g. FAQs, Our Team, About Us, Consumer Products, Web Sites, Computers, Welcome, News, How-to, Connect, (this is a mixture from several web sites) Do these pass the following priority 2 checkpoint? 
[1] 3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information. 
[Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and style sheets to format text and control layout. 
Also, avoid using images to represent text -- use text and style sheets instead. 
I contend no, small image buttons/menus/tabs fail this checkpoint: since an accessible markup exists, viz. 
ordinary HTML. 
Plus the last sentence explicitly says to not use images for text. 
Feasible methods exist. 
You can get rid of the link underline, and control color and font with a stylesheet. 
Rectangular buttons are easy. 
If you want something a bit fancier like rounded corners, it's straightforward to piece together the text parts with slivers of images. 
That's a bit of a kluge, but in balance I think it's better than making the whole thing text, given the importance of that checkpoint to people with low vision, who can otherwise simply enlarge the fonts and/or change the colors. 
(Loads faster too). 
I expect some objections to this position, since a number of well known sites in the disability area use such images, so there are clearly folks who didn't think this was a violation. 
By the way, the one place I would allow text as images are in logos, where there are substantial reasons for making the look exact.

This isn't an academic question for me: e.g. full WCAG is now Pennsylvania State Policy, so we've got to know if image folkder tabs are "legal".

If these are provided by an image, and the equivalent can be formatted according to user preferences, then I think that it satisfies the user requirement but not WCAG. 
I am not sure that alternatives can be formmatted in existing user agents.

As for formatting alternatives in existing user agents: If it's simply text inside an image, you can always piece it together using a table and image fragments. 
Some such images get ugly when the font size gets bigger, or when font color and background are changed, but that's better than not being able to change font size or color at all. 
(also, this technique breaks down if there's pictorial detail immediately behind the image, but we should avoid that anyway since it decreases legibility) There are some buttons that can't be formatted this way, e.g. if the text is written around the circumference of a circle. 
But in that case the page can't get a double A rating, IMHO. 
Of course when once we can count on browsers implementing CSS positioning, we can simply position the text in front of any image we please. 
And once we have good suport for SVG and accessibility thereof, we'll have much more flexibility.

If we don't have to worry about providing audio streams -- because screenreaders exist -- then shouldn't the existence of the various technologies listed above likewise ease our fears regarding text buttons? 
We are willing to say "oh, there's technology to deal with -that-" for a number of items, so where is the line drawn? 
(If screenreaders did not exist, the obligation would be on the web designer to provide an aural output stream for everything, no?) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Kynn Glad you raised that points (really) because I'm sure other people, people perhaps more shy than yourself, are thinking the same thing. 
First of all, the lawyerly position: Doesn't matter what technologies are available: the guidelines say what they say, so the statement that something violates a checkpoint is true regardless. 
But we can do better than that. 
I don't think using a screen magnifier is as good as enlarging fonts. 
1. 
When you enlarge fonts, text wraps at the margins, instead of expanding into a virtual space wider than the screen (assuming the page was well designed). 
When the virtual page is wider than the screen, you have to scroll left and right as well as up and down, which makes it harder to stay oriented. 
So enlarging fonts is better. 
2. With magnification, user is no longer able to control the font. 
Some fonts are better than others. 
3. Some people with low vision need reverse contrast. 
If the buttons are already reverse contrast, then if they reverse the whole screen to read other body text, the buttons get normal contrast. 
So they have to keep flipping the contrast depending on where they are. 
4. 
Similarly, if all you can do is an overall screen color map, you can't get all the text, buttons and body, to have optimal color. 
In short, direct control of font, size, and color of all text is better than a magnifier. 
As for turning off images to see the alt text versions of the buttons: well, then the person with low vision is missing other images on the screen, images which may be used appropriately. 
Also, do browsers allow full CSS control of font, color, size of ALT text? 
(I don't know the answer to that one).

Ah, but when you get to lawyerly arguments, you have two choices. 
One, you can argue that you did or did not adhere to the letter of the law. 
Secondly, however, you can argue that _the law itself is flawed_. 
WCAG is going to be undergoing revision very soon, and it's possible that this very issue will be addressed. 
When _should_ you use textual graphics, and how do you use them accessibly? 
Yes, but I don't think that a screenreader is as good as providing a RealAudio stream. 
1. 
When you use a screenreader, you have a lot less control over the specific voice that is read out loud. 
This has the effect of losing "branding" on a web site and making everything in the world speak with one tone. 
2. A screenreader, even with aural CSS, cannot adequately convey the subtleties of human speech -- the particular intonations, subtle hint of a smile, emphasis on the right words -- that a real person can provide. 
This allows for the true intent of the author to be provided to the audience. 
3. Screenreaders are expensive and represent an economic barrier to entry for web users which is eliminated if you use streaming audio; audio players are cheap or free, while screenreaders are expensive pieces of software. 
In short, direct control of font, size, and color of all text is better than a magnifier. 
In short, a streaming audio file is better than a screenreader. 
Of course, that's not really my point. 
(Please, nobody argue on the merits of streaming media vs screenreaders.) My point is that we accept there is no need for web authors to account for non- visual output because the screenreader software exists and is available. 
Granted, it's not the _best_ way to get that information to those users, but it seems to work. 
Why do we believe that the current technologies don't work here? 
As for turning off images to see the alt text versions of the buttons: well, then the person with low vision is missing other images on the screen, images which may be used appropriately. 
That's a browser issue; a user agent should allow you to selectively view and not view specific items, and there should be a keystroke command or a context menu item which says "Magnify Image" to allow each individual button to be blown up large enough to read.
