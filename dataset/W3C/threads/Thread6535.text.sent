The link to the XSV schema validator on the http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema page is referencing an empty document. 
Is the validator no longer available? 
Thank You Richard Morgan Science Museum of Minnesota Computer Education Center rmorgan@smm.org 
Richard, Are you talking about: When I follow this link I get a Web form with: "XSV version: XSV 1.176/1.87 of 2001/02/16 16:38:43" - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 From: Ian Jacobs ij@w3.org 
Organization: W3C - World Wide Web Consortium Precedence: list Richard, Could you give a time frame on this? 
This service was migrated to another server not very long ago. 
In the early am hours of Wednesday March 7th we upgraded both the webserver, Jigsaw, to a shadow release and the jdk it was using. 
This service suffered from a couple days undetected where this was the symptom while other services on the machine ran fine. 
We believe it is corrected. 
To see if it is an intermitten problem I have done a couple samplings of accessing this 5000 times each without replicating.
