Hi, Could you please send your message in text format. 
* Publishing Preferences dialog misspells "application/xhtml" as "application/xthml+xml" Fixed * Text size is smaller in GL version for the AmayaPage.html 
file We analyze the problem. 
* left/right cursor keys do not work (already reported) Fixed * Default button General Preference dialog has no effect on Export CR/LF Fixed 
* en_US is accepted by General Preferences dialog for language, but when reopened, the preferences list en In Amaya en-US and en are the same value. 
* The windows version is supposed to use the %TEMP% variables, but it 
is using the original directory-c:\temp\amaya. %TEMP% variables are: TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\Brant\LOCALS~1\TempTMP=C:\DOCUME~1\Brant\LOCALS~1\Temp Fixed * Shortcuts beginning with Alt such as Alt + t + Alt + w for cite do not work. 
This includes most shortcuts in Style  Information Type and Style  Character Element. 
Fixed * For AmayaPage.html, the normal view only lists Set DOCTYPE to XHTML 1.1 + MathML, but source view gives all options * The modify doctype menu is available for CSS files. 
* The doctype appears in structure view and is editable for new XHTML 1.1 files.

That seems OK in terms of how amaya processes them, but it should still be 
able to keep the preference specified by the user, and send it as appropriate. 
I happen to use en-GB or en-AU in preference to en-US in browsers that let me do this. 
It would be nice if at some point I could declare my english dictionaries for spellchecking to be en-NZ (or whatever). 
In my work I sometimes have to spellcheck things to be one or other variety of english, and it is a pain 
that I can't do this automatically by applying the appropriate dictionary.

I don't know the formal state of this. 
Looking at it from an X11 Unix point of view, the language - area should always be respected. 
In the unix and X11 world, we speek of C for being the default language. 
In most cases it resembles a kind of English that's understandable by all english speaking peobles, even the Frensh and Chineese. 
Hence, for amaya, if at first the area code is added, it should stay there. 
By default, if no language is speccified, it can be just "en" For the spellchecker and such tools: "en" should be verry light: It should accept both customize and customise. 
Would you realy call that en-NZ? 
Not nz-nz?

Indeed! We also have mi-NZ as an official cultural definition!
