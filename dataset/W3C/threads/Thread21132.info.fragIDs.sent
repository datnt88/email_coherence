<s> platform: Windoze Characters in system charset (win1250) that are not in iso-1 charset are not mapped correctly when saving file.  </s>
<s> (their value from win1250 is kept, not translated to unicode).  </s>

<s> Without request from the user Amaya doesn't change the document charset.  </s>
<s> If you want to change it you have to use "Save As" and chose the new charset.  </s>

<s> When I save it for example in us-ascii, these symbols are replaced with #xNNN, where NNN should be unicode value of these (??,??,...).  </s>
<s> But Amaya places its value in system charset (win1250) instead, so that some other symbol is displayed in all other browsers.  </s>

<s> Numeric character entities give the code position in the document character set.  </s>
<s> If the document is using Windows Code Page, then it is correct for the &amp;#xNNN; references to be referring to Windows CP character numbers and not Unicode ones.  </s>
<s> See section 5.3.1 of the HTML 4.01 Specification.  </s>
<s> If you are observing a browser interpreting entities in a way not consistent with this, it is the browser at fault.  </s>

<s> Example of the bug: character ' ?? ': Unicode value: 0x159=345, in UTF-8 hex C5 99 iso-8859-1: doesn't contain it Win1250(windoze system charset for central European languges): 0xF8=248 In Amaya it is saved (doctype XHTML 1.1, but same behavior for HTML 4.01) as &amp;#xF8; in "us-ascii";(!!!) as asc(0x3E) in iso-8859-1 (???) as hex C3 B8 in UTF-8), which corresponds to 0xF8 but cp1250 is not mentioned anywhere in the document.  </s>
<s> And in iso1, and unicode this value corresponds to '??'.  </s>
<s> So it MUST be a bug in Amaya.  </s>
<s> Charset us-ascii is, as I know, 7-bit In Mozilla Composer (for example) it is saved as as &amp;#345; in x-user-defined charset and also in iso-8859-1 as hex C5 99 in UTF-8 The problem is everywhen the character is in system charset and absent in iso-8859-1 (ie.  </s>
<s> first 256 of Unicode)  </s>
<s> Yes, there're obviously several problems related to proper encoding.  </s>
<s> Maybe they're easier to reproduce by using the ??? character for people working on Western computer systems.  </s>
<s> Amaya - I'm using in 7.1 with Windows XP - will output a character reference &amp;#x80; with US-ASCII, and a "raw" ??? character with ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> In the both cases, its behaviour is wrong.  </s>
<s> It should use &amp;#x20AC;, &amp;#8364; or &amp;euro; instead.  </s>
<s> In a previous message I stated that numeric entities give the code position in the document character set.  </s>
<s> Someone has pointed out to me that "document character set" is a fixed concept with respect to SGML applications like HTML and XML, so my commentary about Amaya being correct in outputting Windows Code Page code positions is misguided.  </s>
<s> Ah well, what can you do when the reference implementation is broken?  </s>
<s> :-( Too many years with MIME I guess... Apologies, Archer End.  </s>
