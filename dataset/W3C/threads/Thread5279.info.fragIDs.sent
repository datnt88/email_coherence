<s> At this point, as we've agreed in the previous telecon, I would like to propose this document as an official note.  </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone for their comments and suggestions.  </s>
<s> Major changes: 1.  </s>
<s> I've added one more approach (approach 4) that approximates the solution by identifying the book as a book about *some* lions.  </s>
<s> It is indeed an approximation, but the question has come up often enough that I felt it was worth at least mentioning and explaining what's different about such an approach.  </s>
<s> Please take a look at the considerations there, since this stuff is all new.  </s>
<s> 2. I've changed to real book examples, as Bernard suggested.  </s>
<s> I used rdfs:seeAlso to refer to the isbn site (cool resource indeed) 3. I have not used SKOS properties in approach 3 directly (avoiding the addition of another complexity level), but I have mentioned it (and also used seeAlso to point to the corresponding SKOS property).  </s>
<s> I hope it's a reasonable compromise.  </s>

<s> OWL's open world semantics require that a SomeValuesFrom restriction be included in any case either in this class description or in some superclass.??  </s>
<s> Otherwise, there is no requirement that "BookAboutAnimals" be about anything.  </s>
