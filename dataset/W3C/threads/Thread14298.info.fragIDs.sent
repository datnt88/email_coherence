Hi, When will the notes from the face2face be put online? 
Sorry, they were online right after the meeting at [1]. 
These minutes have not been reviewed by the chairs, but Jason has given me the go-ahead to publish the URI. 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/20000320 Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 
Hi, When will the notes from the face2face be put online? 
Thanks, Scott 
Read the minutes, and thanks to those who scribed and posted them. 
I especially enjoyed reading the comments on cognitive disabilities. 
Of special interest were comments by Mark Urban about the folks in NC who've noticed web navigation is a first problem for the mentally retarded. 
I hope we will hear more from him on this issue.
