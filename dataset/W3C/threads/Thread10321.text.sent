Am I missing something, or does this really not stand up?: 
The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) with comments and with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList of the literal text l, i.e. the entire element content of this property element. 
As I recall, the "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" is an *octet* sequence, not a character sequence, and as such is not eligible to be a lexical form.

We use events equivalent to the latter.

The output of canonicalization, the canonical form, is an octet sequence forming the text generated from the canonical form (XPath node-set). 
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#ProcessingModel 
The XML Canonicalization documents define not only "canonical form of an XML document" (the octets) but "canonical XML" which is XML written in the canonical form. 
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#Terminology 
We use Exclusive XML Canonicalization with comments, which is XML written in the exclusive canonical form (with comments) i.e. written into XML's alphabet - Unicode characters - and encoded as a document into UTF-8 (ibid). 
That's what we use. 
Dave Dave I am going on holiday - actually I was meant to already have gone ... (That is I can see Graham's point but haven't the energy to suggest a fix before stopping work) Jeremy Got it, thanks. 
Hmmm... it seems to say the right things, but it's not as clear as I'd like. 
"The term canonical XML refers to XML ..." so far, so good, because XML is a s3equence of Unicode characters, right? 
"... that is in canonical form." 
But they've just said the canonical form is the UTF-8 encoding. 
I'd like to believe this works, but maybe some belt-and-braces would help us to to be sure, such as: The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Canonical XML obtained by applying Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]), with comments and with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList, to the literal text l, i.e. the entire element content of this property element. 
That is, it is a Unicode string whose UTF-8 encoding is the Canonical XML form of the literal. 
Hmph! 
That's pretty heavy going. 
Maybe just add the last sentence to what you already have? 
#g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E Couldn't we get away with the current text and a pedant's note in brackets ... e.g. .... current text ... (Strictly, it is a Unicode string whose UTF-8 encoding is the Canonical XML form described).
