<s> I would like to make a few suggestions for inclusion in the guidelines regarding the generation of ALT text by the HTML tool.  </s>
<s> HTML tools should NOT generate 'placeholder' ALT text but should leave the Alt text blank (ALT="") or not generate the Alt attribute.  </s>
<s> Placeholder text could be generated by the tool to let the user know that some text should be added.  </s>
<s> Examples of this include "Alt text here" or "Place Alt text here".  </s>
<s> If placeholder text is generated then accessibility checking tools will only see that there is Alt text and assume the element is accessible.  </s>
<s> This should be a priority 1 item.  </s>
<s> HTML tools should generate default Alt text with caution.  </s>
<s> If default text is generated then the user must be offered the option of changing the text.  </s>
<s> Priority 2? These ideas were discussed on the WAI ER IG conference call on Nov. 4, 1998.  </s>

<s> It may be reasonable to present a default option for repeated images - the bullet list is one exmple of this, but more generally we have suggested taht really good systems (this probably applies mostly to those which handle site control not just individual pages) would collect databases of ALT text and LONGDESCs for images (etc).  </s>

<s> However, my intention was to show that there is a precedent for putting "to do" placeholder text in generated code.  </s>
<s> So a possible, non-pri1 guideline could would result in code like this: and This would be in addition to any other source code commenting (not embedded in tags).  </s>
