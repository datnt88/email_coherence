I would like to make a few suggestions for inclusion in the guidelines regarding the generation of ALT text by the HTML tool. 
HTML tools should NOT generate 'placeholder' ALT text but should leave the Alt text blank (ALT="") or not generate the Alt attribute. 
Placeholder text could be generated by the tool to let the user know that some text should be added. 
Examples of this include "Alt text here" or "Place Alt text here". 
If placeholder text is generated then accessibility checking tools will only see that there is Alt text and assume the element is accessible. 
This should be a priority 1 item. 
HTML tools should generate default Alt text with caution. 
If default text is generated then the user must be offered the option of changing the text. 
Priority 2? These ideas were discussed on the WAI ER IG conference call on Nov. 4, 1998.

Authoring Tools should never set the ALT text to null (ALT="").? 
That 
generally means that the image has no meaning and since there is a ALT 
attribute, verses the lack of one, you can be sure the author is telling you 
that the image has no meaning. 
Place holder text is interesting.? Throughout Microsoft development tools are source code comments like: /* TODO:? 
Add code to make this work */ Would the "Place ALT text here", or better yet "Put image description here" be reasonable to folks?? 

HTML tools should generate default Alt text with caution. 
If default text is generated then the user must be offered the option of changing the text. 
Priority 2? 
The only time an authoring tool should generate the ALT text itself is when 
it's absolutely certain of the meaning.? For example, graphical bullets might have pre-fab ALT text.? Same with graphical horizontal rules and table 
borders.

Yes, agreed. 
Yes too.

And even then, the tool should inform the user and allow the text to be changed.

Yes, agreed.

Yes too. 
It may be reasonable to present a default option for repeated images - the bullet list is one exmple of this, but more generally we have suggested taht really good systems (this probably applies mostly to those which handle site control not just individual pages) would collect databases of ALT text and LONGDESCs for images (etc). 
It would then make sense to use them... Charles McCathieNevile 
Charles (Chuck) asked if it would be fine to add comments into the source code, along the lines of Microsoft's Java development stuff, which fills the code with /* Do something or other here */ It seems that if you did an analagous thing in HTML it would be which would be fine.

This is good, and we should consider adding it to the guidelines. 
However, my intention was to show that there is a precedent for putting "to do" placeholder text in generated code. 
So a possible, non-pri1 guideline could would result in code like this: and This would be in addition to any other source code commenting (not embedded in tags). 
The idea being that when the ToolTip shows up with the "TODO:" it'll be an additional reminder to add descriptions.

Charles (Chuck) suggested that we could have That was not reallly what I had meant - I was envisioning The conditions under which I would be happy to support the To Do ALT tag are that they make the author look like a complete goose if they don't do it. 
But I thnk I would prefer no ALT text. 
It really comes dow to a question of which approach is more likely to get the user to do the job.
