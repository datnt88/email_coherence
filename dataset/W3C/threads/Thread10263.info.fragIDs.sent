<s> I am still unhappy with the way that RDF sort of reserves certain things to itself, but also sort of allows anyone to do anything.  </s>
<s> We've been asked [2] to be clearer about RDF namespace terms (full message below).  </s>
<s> I'll try and pick out some key points for discussion.  </s>
<s> 1. "syntactic" URIs.  </s>
<s> I think we could be stronger about these and say that they MUST NOT appear  </s>
<s> in an RDF abstract syntax graph.  </s>
<s> (Does the syntax document already say this?) Concepts (section 4) currently says that they "should not be used in RDF to denote any kind of resource" -- which might be strengthened to "must not".  </s>
<s> 2. Status of rdfs:Class rdfs:Class rdfs:Class .  </s>
<s> My view is that this is syntactically legitimate RDF, whose truth is neither asserted nor denied by the RDF specification.  </s>
<s> Use of statements like this in RDF data is strongly discouraged, except as part of a semantic extension in conformance with the General Monotonicity Lemma [1].  </s>
<s> Some extra words to this effect might be added to Concepts section 2.2.6:  </s>
<s> e.g. While legal RDF data may make assertions about concepts that are introduced by the RDF specification (the values, classes and properties indicated by specific RDF vocabulary terms), such use is strongly discouraged and may  </s>
<s> lead to RDF data that is useless when processed in accordance with normal RDF entailments.  </s>
<s> As noted in the RDF formal semantics [RDF-SEMANTICS], semantic extensions may further constrain the meaning of RDF vocabulary terms in ways that conform to the General Monotonicity Lemma.  </s>
<s> Also, the paragraph in section 4 that currently reads: Vocabulary terms in the rdf: namespace are listed in section 5.1 of the RDF syntax specification [RDF-SYNTAX].  </s>
<s> Some of these terms are defined by the RDF specifications to denote specific concepts.  </s>
<s> Others have purely syntactic purpose (e.g. rdf:ID is part of the RDF/XML syntax) and should not be used in RDF to denote any kind of resource.  </s>
<s> could add something like: The meaning of non-syntactic RDF vocabulary terms is defined by the RDF Semantics specification [RDF-SEMANTICS].  </s>
<s> 3. what is the status of OWL's use of the RDF and RDFS vocabularies?  </s>
<s> I regard these as fine as long as they conform with the General Monotonicity Lemma [1].  </s>
<s> I can't easily tell, but I assume they do I think this is covered above.  </s>

<s> I am still unhappy with the way that RDF sort of reserves certain things to itself, but also sort of allows anyone to do anything.  </s>
<s> In particular, Section 2.2.6 says ``RDF is an open-world framework that allows anyone to make statements about any resource'' but Section 4 says ``Certain URI references are reserved for use by RDF and should not be used in ways not supported by the RDF specficiations.'' So, what is the status of, for example, rdfs:Class rdfs:Class rdfs:Class .  </s>
<s> Is it a) completely unobjectionable, b) something that should not be done, or c) forbidden?  </s>
<s> Section 2.2.6 argues for a); Section 4 argues for b) or maybe even c).  </s>
<s> Similarly, what is the status of OWL's use of the RDF and RDFS vocabularies?  </s>
<s> (See for the current editor's draft of the most relevant portion of the OWL specifications.)  </s>
<s> Is this something that any formal specification can unobjectionably do, or is there something wrong with using the RDF and RDFS vocabularies in this fashion?  </s>
<s> The RDF Semantics document makes this even less clear as it explicitly mentions that semantic extensions may modify the meaning of rdfs:domain and rdfs:range (Section 4.1), but does not say anthing similar for most other elements of the RDF and RDFS vocabularies.  </s>
