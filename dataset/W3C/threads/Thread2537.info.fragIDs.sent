It's quite a while after the deadline for a revised charter/milestone 
list, but here is my best estimate as to the schedule for HTTP-WG: 
July 1997:"Hit Metering" to IESG as Proposed Standard (draft-ietf-http-hit-metering) August 1997: "State Management Mechanism" to IESG as Proposed Standard. 
(draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec) Aug, 1997: discuss revised HTTP/1.1 internet draft revised PEP internet draft revised Content Negotiation Requirements draft revised TCN draft September 1997: - Revised draft on Connection Management HTTP - Revised Content Negotiation Requirements draft November 1997: all documents to IESG: + HTTP/1.1, as two or more documents, to become Draft Standard + requirements for content negotiation, to become Informational RFC + Transparent Content Negotiation, to become Experimental RFC + Feature registration, to become Best Current Practice + Connection Management, to become Informational or Proposed Standard + PEP, to become either Proposed Standard or Experimental + Dec 1997: Working group to suspend, close, or continue, depending on additional review necessary. 
Foteos Macrides: 
Would you please clarify the situation with respect to Koen's "safe" header draft. 
That has been implemented in released versions of Lynx, can be implemented immediately by any server/script which processes form submissions with METHOD=POST, and poses no backward compatibility problems for UAs which haven't implemented it. 
Koen and I both posted messages requesting this WG to move forward on that, but no reply has been forthcoming as yet. 
Quick comment on the status of the safe draft: I submitted a new version (draft-holtman-http-safe-02.txt) to the ID editor yesterday, with slightly improved wording, mainly because the old one had expired. 
I think that SAFE should be added to the 1.1 issue list.

Koen. 
Please be so kind as to remove me from this mailing list. 
Thank you.
