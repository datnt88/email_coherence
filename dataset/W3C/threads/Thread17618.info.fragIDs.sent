<s> The meaning of "relative position" depends on the situation.  </s>
<s> It may mean the distance from the beginning of the document to the point of regard (how much of the document has been read), it may mean the cell currently being examined in a table, or the position of the current document in a set of documents.  </s>
<s> For people with visual impairments, it is important that the point of regard remain as stable as possible.  </s>
<s> For instance, when returning to a document previously viewed, the user's previous point of regard on the  </s>
<s> document should be restored.  </s>
<s> The user agent should not disturb the user's  </s>
<s> point of regard by shifting focus to a different frame or window when an event occurs without notifying the user of the change.  </s>
<s> Disturbing the user's point of regard may cause problems for users who have movement impairments, who are blind, who have visual impairments, who have certain types of learning disabilities, or for any user who cannot or has chosen not to view the authors representation of information.  </s>

<s> In case of a match, the selection should be moved to the element.  </s>
<s> CMN: This section could be structured much better.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints are, so far as I can see, as follows: 1. Allow the user to navigate the document's structural tree [p2] 2. Allow the user to generate and navigate a tree based on teh semantics of a DTD [p3] Technique: For an HTML document, construct a tree where headers are considered children of preceding headers with greater priority, and block-level elements are considered children of headers.  </s>

<s> In case of a match, move the selection to the content [p2]  </s>

<s> 6.3 Provide information about events It is important to alert users, in an output device-independent fashion, when important events occur during a browsing session.  </s>
<s> To avoid confusion that the effects of scripts may cause, users should be notified when scripts are executed (or be able to disable scripts entirely).  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> is also important for security reasons; users should be able to decide whether to allow scripts to execute on their machines.  </s>
<s> 6.3.1 [Priority 1] Allow the user to navigate among elements with associated event handlers.  </s>

<s> In the classic pathological case where the script reads the mouse position and does different things based on where the mouse was, there is nothing in the paramter profile which says the mouse position dependency lines up with the layout boundaries of elements in the document tree.  </s>
<s> So I am afraid that it is like a server-side image map.  </s>
<s> One should be able to navigate to the element for which an on* event is bound to a handler, but not necessarily wander the tree inside that element.  </s>
<s> That is just too many places to go.  </s>
<s> Unless you are going to slave a pseudo-mouse position to the layout geometry associated with the elements navigated to in the parse tree, the navigation does not tell the script anything that calling the script from the enclosing element (where it is mentioned) fails to tell it.  </s>
