I have interspersed my comments between (often lengthy) chunks of the document (look for CMN:). 
Where I don't see any problems, I have left out the relevant excerpt (look for SNIP) 6.1 Provide information about the document view Users that are viewing documents through linear channels of perception like speech (since speech is temporal in nature) and tactile displays (current tactile technology is limited in the amount of information that can be displayed) have difficultly maintaining a sense of their relative position in a document. 
The meaning of "relative position" depends on the situation. 
It may mean the distance from the beginning of the document to the point of regard (how much of the document has been read), it may mean the cell currently being examined in a table, or the position of the current document in a set of documents. 
For people with visual impairments, it is important that the point of regard remain as stable as possible. 
For instance, when returning to a document previously viewed, the user's previous point of regard on the 
document should be restored. 
The user agent should not disturb the user's 
point of regard by shifting focus to a different frame or window when an event occurs without notifying the user of the change. 
Disturbing the user's point of regard may cause problems for users who have movement impairments, who are blind, who have visual impairments, who have certain types of learning disabilities, or for any user who cannot or has chosen not to view the authors representation of information. 
CMN: This paragraph (above) could be significantly trimmed without losing any content. 
SNIP 
6.1.9 [Priority 2] When a document is loaded or when requested by the user, make available document summary information. 
CMN: This is too vague. 
What information is required? 
6.1.11 [Priority 3] Provide the user with information about document loading status (e.g., whether loading has stalled, whether enough of the page has loaded to begin navigating, whether following a link involves a fee, etc.) CMN: This is also very vague. 
Perhaps this should be combined with 6.1.9, and made explicit as to what tyes of information are required. 
6.2 Provide information about document structure 
Hierarchical navigation (through the document tree) is useful for efficiently navigating the major topics and sub-topics of a document. 
6.2.1 [Priority 2] Allow the user to view a document outline constructed from its structural elements (e.g., from header and list elements). 
6.2.2 [Priority 2] Allow the user to navigate the document tree. 
6.2.3 [Priority 2] Allow the user to navigate sequentially among headers. 
6.2.4 [Priority 2] Allow the user to navigate sequentially among block elements (e.g., paragraphs, lists and list items, etc.) 
6.2.5 [Priority 2] Allow the user to search for an element in the current document based on its text content. 
In case of a match, the selection should be moved to the element. 
CMN: This section could be structured much better. 
The checkpoints are, so far as I can see, as follows: 1. Allow the user to navigate the document's structural tree [p2] 2. Allow the user to generate and navigate a tree based on teh semantics of a DTD [p3] Technique: For an HTML document, construct a tree where headers are considered children of preceding headers with greater priority, and block-level elements are considered children of headers. 
Amaya does something like this in its 'outline' view. 
3. Allow the user to search for content. 
In case of a match, move the selection to the content [p2] 
4. Allow the user to search for an element, by specifying text content or the content of descriptive attributes (eg TITLE, ALT). 
In case of a match, move te selection to the element [p3] 
6.3 Provide information about events It is important to alert users, in an output device-independent fashion, when important events occur during a browsing session. 
To avoid confusion that the effects of scripts may cause, users should be notified when scripts are executed (or be able to disable scripts entirely). 
This 
is also important for security reasons; users should be able to decide whether to allow scripts to execute on their machines. 
6.3.1 [Priority 1] Allow the user to navigate among elements with associated event handlers. 
CMN: Is this relevant to UAs which do not handle the events? 
I suspect 
not. 
Should it apply to navigating the children of an element which 
handles bubbled events? 
I suspect so. 
All Children? 
Harder to say. 
6.3.2 [Priority 2] Alert the user when scripts or applets are executed. 
6.3.3 [Priority 3] Provide information about document changes resulting from the execution of a script. 
CMN: I suggest that 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 be rewritten as follows: 1. Provide notification of content and structure changes to the Document Object Model. 
[p1] 2. Provide notification of style changes to the Document Object Model. 
[p2] 3. Provide information about content and structure changes to the Document Object Model. 
[p2] 4. Provide information about style changes to the Document Object Model.

my comments preceded by ja: ja: In reviewing section 5 for SMIL/multimedia accessibility I had one major question. 
Is a plugin (SMIL player, shockwave, insert your favorite plugin here...) a user agent? 
I have always assumed that a plugin was a user agent and would conform to user interface accessibility as well as other appropriate guidelines. 
But, 
the UA guidelines do not specifically address this point. 
5.1.10 [Priority 1] Allow the user to control the position of captions. 
ja: Captions are not one size fit all, in addition to caption placement there is a need for 5.1.10.1 [Priority 1] Allow the user to override font family of the caption. 
5.1.10.2 [Priority 1] Allow the user to override font size of the caption. 
5.1.10.3 [Priority 1] Allow the user to override foreground color of the caption. 
5.1.10.4 [Priority 1] Allow the user to override background color of the caption. 
5.2.6 [Priority 1] Allow the user specify that captions for video be rendered at the same time as the video. 
ja: Similar to audio tracks, captions may be available in different languages. 
There is a need for 5.2.x [Priority 1] Allow the user to choose from among available caption tracks. 
5.2.7 [Priority 2] Allow the user specify that audio descriptions of video be rendered at the same time as the video. 
ja: In discussion with the folks a WGBH, it was recommended that this checkpoint be changed to a Priority 1. Scenario-video showing professor writing complex equations and graphs on the overhead and discussing them but not describing what he/she actually wrote on the overhead. 
Without description this would be inaccessible to people with visual impairments. 
This could be generalize to any video presentation of visually rich or complex information where the visually presented information is critical to the understanding of the presentation. 
ja: additionally, there may also be description tracks in different languages, there is no evidence of this yet so a Priority 2 is recommended. 
So there is a need for 5.2.x [Priority 2] Allow the user to choose from among available audio description tracks.

It is my understanding that with embedded objects, the browser, such as IE, 
truly does not know what the object is. 
That being the case, the "device" 
that is actually rendering the content would be the plug in, not the graphical browser. 
Hence, a media player plug in would be the user agent in this case, and would have to meet all of the accessibility requirements.

Reply to: RE choosing description language Re: review of section 5 The SMIL presentation Charles mentions below is available at ftp.wgbh.org/incoming/ncam. 
Download CAR.ZIP. 
This is a recently uploaded clip that makes use of the switch element of SMIL. 
After you unzip the file, you can see and hear captions and descriptions in English, Spanish and German by doing the following: 1. Open the Options Menu 2. Choose Preferences 3. Choose the Content tab 4. Choose English, Spanish or German from the language menu 5. Turn on the enable captions option at the bottom of the window. 
Note that while you'll see and hear captions and descriptions in the language of your choice, the program audio will always be in English (at least, for the time being). 
Let me know if you have questions.

Date: 2/24/99 12:10 PM From: Charles McCathieNevile It would seem more sensible to make the checkpoint: allow user to select language(s) [p1] as part of ensuring accessibility in the tool as a whole. 
The only accessible SMIL presentation I have ever seen includes audio, captions and descriptions, available in english, spanish, and german. 
It explains a piece of relativity theory, and is actually very cool.

DOCUMENT BEING REVIEWED: 
To discuss in a teleconf. 
ISSUE: What document summary information must the UA make available? 
Specific information should be the in the checkpoint, the rest in techniques. 
If no specific information is required, the checkpoint should be dropped and the topic discussed in the techniques document. 
I agree that 6.1.9 and 6.1.11 should be combined and that the information required be specified more clearly. 
The last example about whether following a link involves a fee is related to the W3C ECommerce Activity, Micropayments WG. 
This sounds like a dependence with that group, i.e., that markup of a "fee link" must be recognizable in some way. 
PROPOSAL: - Drop the "fee link" part of the example - Talk to the Micropayment WG about this dependency. 
PROPOSAL FROM CMN for different checkpoints: 
For 3., I will use your wording. 
Notice that it allows searches that span more than one element. 
Agreed. 
This will be covered in the conformance section by the definition of "applicable checkpoint". 
I'm not sure. 
That's why the checkpoint refers to "associated event handlers", which in HTML will mean "on*" attributes. 
I don't think the WG has enough information yet from the DOM to say more. 
PROPOSAL FROM CMN to be discussed in a teleconf. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) 
DOCUMENT BEING REVIEWD: 
I believe so. 
This should be stated in the abstract/introduction. 
This is covered by the following statement in 5.1: They apply to alternative representations of content as well as primary content. 
Note that alternative representations of content include captions. 
This was an attempt to reduce the number of checkpoints. 
This was decided on a couple of teleconfs ago (don't have the URI right now). 
ISSUE: Priority level of 5.2.7. 
This was also added as the results of a teleconf. 
Thanks for the comments Jim! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) 
I suspect not. 
In the classic pathological case where the script reads the mouse position and does different things based on where the mouse was, there is nothing in the paramter profile which says the mouse position dependency lines up with the layout boundaries of elements in the document tree. 
So I am afraid that it is like a server-side image map. 
One should be able to navigate to the element for which an on* event is bound to a handler, but not necessarily wander the tree inside that element. 
That is just too many places to go. 
Unless you are going to slave a pseudo-mouse position to the layout geometry associated with the elements navigated to in the parse tree, the navigation does not tell the script anything that calling the script from the enclosing element (where it is mentioned) fails to tell it.
