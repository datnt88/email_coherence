I designed my company's web page using Netscape Composer, and I edited the HTML for accessibility purposes in Notepad. 
My company wishes to use Microsoft FrontPage for further web development, however, when I imported the Netscape version of the page into FrontPage, I experienced a number of formatting problems. 
Has anyone had any accessibility issues with FrontPage-made webs? 
Yes. 
:) FrontPage-produced websites scare me, frankly. 
No offense to the Microsoft people on this list.

Any comments you send me on the list or privately will get forwarded directly to the FP team.

:^) -Chris Wilson Program Manager, Internet Explorer Microsoft Well, FP's improved in later versions. 
I don't use it myself -- I don't use _any_ HTML authoring crutchHHHtool, save for vi/notepad/lemmy. 
However, my wife and I have basically discovered that whenever we find a really bad page -- it was almost always FrontPage generated. 
This may simply be a problem with user education rather than something the FP _programmers_ can fix. 
I dunno. 
Perhaps FrontPage and other tools make things a little _too_ easy? 
(Which goes against what I said previously, a little -- however I think that things should be easy _and_ produce good code.) As I said, FP is better than it was, and as I don't use it, I'm afraid I don't have any specifics that are worth passing along.

I'm only offended [by negative comments about our products] if you don't tell me how we can make it better. 
Any comments [about MS Front Page] you send me on the list or privately will get forwarded directly to the FP team. 
Chris Wilson of Microsoft added: Larry Behrens suggests: While I, also, do not use Front Page (anyone see a pattern here G ), I certainly respect your attitude; any manufacturer who wants to better their product deserves input, so may I suggest that you access Those are the people, professionals and hobbyists alike, who either do or do not use your products (and they are not shy about revealing the *why* grin ). 
You may already have someone assigned to monitoring those lists; if not, I certainly would suggest it. 
Regards, Larry Behrens What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is the exact opposite.

Hi.. My thoughts exactly, I finally found a class for FrontPage98 at Prosoft, in the hope that maybe we the webmasters need a class in simple?

Greetings, I can tell you all this: I spent the entire weekend fighting with FrontPage, trying to get it to import a page that was made originally with FP without messing up the formatting. 
I was completely unsuccessful. 
I have never had a positive experience with the import tool in FP, and, if one doesn't use one of the FP "themes," working with FP is quite difficult. 
Hi.. Funny, that is one of the things I thought needed more training to figure out, I found it unbelieveable that I lost my formatting ;/ Perhaps....FrontPage needs it's own mailing support list, is there one?
