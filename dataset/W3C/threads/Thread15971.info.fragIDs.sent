<s> I have an application to publish a directory of information - name, city, state, and so on - on the Web.  </s>

<s> Solutions must work with HTML 3.2; advanced solutions such as HTML4.0+CSS which degrade gracefully to HTML 3.2 are even better.  </s>
<s> This application is still under development, so unfortunately I can not yet provide a URL.  </s>
<s> DETAILS: The application allows a user to search the directory for entries which match their criteria, for example: all the entries in the state of Ohio whose name contains "Smith".  </s>
<s> The search results page lists the matching entries, and each entry in the list links to the full details of that entry.  </s>
<s> On the results page, a summary of the search criteria and results appears at the top of the page: There are 130 directory entries matching your search criteria: Name contains "Smith" State=OH Results: 1-25 26-50 Last 25 Sorted by: Name The user can view 25 entries at a time.  </s>
<s> The "Results:" line lets them navigate through all the results and changes in response to the user's current position.  </s>
<s> In this example the user is viewing the first 25 matching entries; "26-50" and "Last 25" are hyperlinked to those blocks of entries, while "1-25" is not, providing an indication to the user of their current position.  </s>
<s> The "Sorted by:" line explicitly describes the sort order.  </s>
<s> The matching entries are presented in a table.  </s>
<s> The table is structural: column headings provide field names - name, city and state - while the rows provide the values for each field.  </s>
<s> Each name links to the full contents in the deirectory for that name.  </s>
<s> The default sort order is by Name, and the columns are listed in sort order.  </s>
<s> SOLUTIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION These are *not* necessarily accessible.  </s>
<s> 1) Highlight the column heading(s) for the sort field(s) to indicate the sort order.  </s>
<s> For example, an arrow could be placed at the front of the column heading - ^Name or  Name - as an additional, visual signal that the rows are sorted in ascending order by Name.  </s>
<s> I don't know how this could be done accessibly.  </s>
<s> 2) Let the user set the sort order with a radio button selection on the search form.  </s>
<s> To change the sort order on the results page, they've have to go back to the search form, revise the sort order, then re-submit the form.  </s>
<s> 3) Let the user change the sort order on the results page.  </s>
<s> This could be done by: 2a) Providing a simple form at the top of the page which allows the user to change the sort order, again with a radio button selection.  </s>
<s> 2b) Letting the user directly manipulate the column headings to indicate the preferred sort order.  </s>
<s> For example: the column heading text could link back to the server with a URL parm indicating the new sort order.  </s>
<s> The server obliges by resorting the results and returning the page back to the user.  </s>

<s> It doesn't sound to me like any of these ideas present an accesibility problem.  </s>
<s> Some user interfaces might be more intuitively recognisable than others, but I am not sure.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile I am imagining that you would get something like the following: example (summary information) Sorted by: [ X ] Name [ ] State [ ] Shoe size Select new sort criteria and {RE-SORT} NAME STATE SHOE SIZE {charles} {vic} {lots} {henrik} {dk} {some} {tim} {uk} {quite some} {ziggy} {out} {none} example end (where {something} is a link).  </s>
<s> so selecting the State checkbox and pressing re-sort would go back to the server and generate: example (summary information) Sorted by: [ ] Name [ X ] State [ ] Shoe size Select new sort criteria and {RE-SORT} NAME STATE SHOE SIZE {henrik} {dk} {some} {ziggy} {out} {none} {tim} {uk} {quite some} {charles} {vic} {lots} example end or something like example (summary information) Sorted by: [ ] Name [ X ] State [ ] Shoe size Select new sort criteria and {RE-SORT} STATE NAME SHOE SIZE {dk} {henrik} {some} {out} {ziggy} {none} {uk} {tim} {quite some} {vic} {charles} {lots} example end If this is server-side there is no problem.  </s>
<s> A really neat trick would be to provide an option of reading column-wise, so you get example (summary information) Sorted by: [ ] Name [ X ] State [ ] Shoe size [ ]row-wise [x]column-wise Select new sort criteria and {RE-SORT} STATE {dk} {out} {uk} {vic} NAME {henrik} {ziggy} {tim} {charles} SHOE SIZE {some} {none} {quite some} {lots} example end What you're talking about sounds like the Yahoo classifieds where you may sort by ad date, price whatever.  </s>
