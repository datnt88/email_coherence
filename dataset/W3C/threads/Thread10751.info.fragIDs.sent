<s> At least, that is how I have thought about these matters.  </s>
<s> There are several decisions we made that I don't think were the best possible, but not so seriously flawed that I felt compelled to register a formal objection.  </s>
<s> Consensus involves some compromise.  </s>

<s> My reading of the process document concurs with Graham not Dan ... [[Reviewers MAY register a formal objection any time they are dissatisfied with how a Working Group has handled an issue.]] with formal objection linked to with text which clearly suggests that a formal objection is a document of some sort (e.g. an e-mail).  </s>
<s> However, defines consensus has including the absence of objections - and it is not clear whether this is or is not intended to mean formal objections.  </s>
<s> I act on the assumption that voting against=objection and these !=formal objection Jeremy  </s>
