I'm using Tidy to convert plain vanilla HTML into XHTML, and am running into a problem. 
xhtml, but the id is invalid. 
I understand that the name attribute is depreciated in xhtml and that an id attribute is a good practice, but I would like to turn off the "id" being automatically output, and cannot find a way to do so. 
Any advice? 
Wendy A good thing in general. 
Maybe "valid" but not "conforming", the recommendation restricts the value further to match the Name production in XML 1.0 and "1" doesn't do so. 
Upcoming Tidy versions will include better checks for name and id attributes. 
I understand that the name attribute is depreciated in xhtml "deprecated", it already was in HTML 4.01. 
_Required_, the name attribute only may be used for better compatibility. 
Newer XHTML versions don't include the name attribute at all. 
but I would like to turn off the "id" being automatically output, and cannot find a way to do so. 
There isn't and I don't see any good reason to change that.

Do a two step process, use tidy to convert to XHTML, then use XSLT to strip off the id attribute.

Or better, don't use IDs beginning with numbers. 
Will work just fine. 
As we move to XHTML, NAME will disappear and be supplanted by ID. IDs can't start with a number.
