<s> At the WAI GL meeting at CSUN, I took an action item to re-organize the style/text structure section toward or more pragmatic (wrt  </s>
<s> Required/Recommended) and simpler approach.  </s>
<s> Here's what I have in mind, and I'd like some feedback before I move forward in more details.  </s>
<s> Basically, I'd like to merge section 1 on Style and section 7 on Text, Symbols, etc in a new section 1 called "Style and Structure" and only make Required items that are required.  </s>
<s> Required: use valid HTML4/CSS2 document is readable without style use proper nesting of headers (no use of H3 for big font) use UL/LI for list (not for indent) avoid blinking or scrolling text [Interim] Recommended: no text in image when CSS can achieve the same (but of course if you use image as text, ALT is required) no invisible 1pixel image for adjustment  </s>
<s> no B,I,TT,ALIGN,BORDER,FONT,BACKGROUND (HTML4 deprecated++)  </s>
<s> use proper phrase elements: EM, STRONG, DFN, CODE, SAMP, KBD, VAR, CITE, ABBR, and ACRONYM  </s>
<s> use proper Quotations: BLOCKQUOTE and Q elements  </s>
<s> provide title for HR specify structure with DIV and SPAN (example NavBar)  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> B, I, and TT are not deprecated, and they still have some use for situations where HTML lacks a suitable phrase element.  </s>
<s> For example, B class="vector" x /B and I lang="la" i.e. /I are in my opinion better than SPAN class="vector" x /SPAN and SPAN lang="la" i.e. /SPAN since the B and I elements can express the meaning to visual browsers that don't support style sheets.  </s>
<s> The BORDER attribute of TABLE is also not deprecated.  </s>
<s> Given the weak browser support for style sheets (particularly with borders and tables), I don't see the harm in using the BORDER attribute.  </s>
<s> Is it too early to recommend using Q when almost no browsers support it?  </s>

<s> By deprecated++, I meant to encompass [deprecated thing + a couple of presentation markup not yet deprecated in HTML4].  </s>
<s> Yes, B and I have acquire some semantics over the years.  </s>
<s> I guess we need to be more precised and mention that we do not recommend their use for purely typographical presentation: use CSS instead, and if it's to note strong or emphasis, people can use STRONG and EM.  </s>
<s> How about [Interim] and then CSS2 ?  </s>
<s> How about [New] ?  </s>
<s> Right; B, I, and TT should never be used in place of a phrase element that expresses the meaning.  </s>
<s> But I don't think we should object to combining B, I, and TT with poorly supported phrase elements (e.g., using I with Q or INS), nor to using B, I, or TT in place of SPAN.  </s>
<s> I guess... But is there really any accessibility harm in an author specifying table borders in HTML?  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
