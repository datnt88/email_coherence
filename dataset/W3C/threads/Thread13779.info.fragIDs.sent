At the WAI GL meeting at CSUN, I took an action item to re-organize the style/text structure section toward or more pragmatic (wrt 
Required/Recommended) and simpler approach. 
Here's what I have in mind, and I'd like some feedback before I move forward in more details. 
Basically, I'd like to merge section 1 on Style and section 7 on Text, Symbols, etc in a new section 1 called "Style and Structure" and only make Required items that are required. 
Required: use valid HTML4/CSS2 document is readable without style use proper nesting of headers (no use of H3 for big font) use UL/LI for list (not for indent) avoid blinking or scrolling text [Interim] Recommended: no text in image when CSS can achieve the same (but of course if you use image as text, ALT is required) no invisible 1pixel image for adjustment 
no B,I,TT,ALIGN,BORDER,FONT,BACKGROUND (HTML4 deprecated++) 
use proper phrase elements: EM, STRONG, DFN, CODE, SAMP, KBD, VAR, CITE, ABBR, and ACRONYM 
use proper Quotations: BLOCKQUOTE and Q elements 
provide title for HR specify structure with DIV and SPAN (example NavBar) 
[snip] 
B, I, and TT are not deprecated, and they still have some use for situations where HTML lacks a suitable phrase element. 
For example, B class="vector" x /B and I lang="la" i.e. /I are in my opinion better than SPAN class="vector" x /SPAN and SPAN lang="la" i.e. /SPAN since the B and I elements can express the meaning to visual browsers that don't support style sheets. 
The BORDER attribute of TABLE is also not deprecated. 
Given the weak browser support for style sheets (particularly with borders and tables), I don't see the harm in using the BORDER attribute. 
Is it too early to recommend using Q when almost no browsers support it?

By deprecated++, I meant to encompass [deprecated thing + a couple of presentation markup not yet deprecated in HTML4]. 
Yes, B and I have acquire some semantics over the years. 
I guess we need to be more precised and mention that we do not recommend their use for purely typographical presentation: use CSS instead, and if it's to note strong or emphasis, people can use STRONG and EM. 
How about [Interim] and then CSS2 ? 
How about [New] ? 
Right; B, I, and TT should never be used in place of a phrase element that expresses the meaning. 
But I don't think we should object to combining B, I, and TT with poorly supported phrase elements (e.g., using I with Q or INS), nor to using B, I, or TT in place of SPAN. 
I guess... But is there really any accessibility harm in an author specifying table borders in HTML? 
Sounds good.
