Hello, I am trying to convert a HTML file to an XHTML using tidy. 
I am using the following commandline - tidy -asxhtml -o out.xhtml 
in.html 
This runs and gives out a lot of warnings and errors regarding unrecognised tags etc. 
But on windows, the out.xhtml 
file is created, whereas on linux, it just prints out the errors and warnings and quits. 
I downloaded the recent versions of tidy from http://tidy.sf.net 
What am I missing? 
TIA VaibhaV Have an example?

TIA VaibhaV Pick up source code of any site. 
I just did this - lynx --dump --source http://www.yahoo.com  
/tmp/yahoo.html 
Then ran tidy on it - tidy -asxhtml -o test.xhtml 
/tmp/yahoo.html 
It prints out a ton of warnings and errors and the test.xhtml 
file is not created. 
VaibhaV Doh! 
It seems there was a change from the 15th to the 18th that fixed this bug. 
I usually don't update the windows binaries if the source changes in that little of time. 
I've uploaded new ones: http://tidy.int64.org

VaibhaV Hello, I am not exactly sure about this. 
Did you update the windows binaries? 
I need to use the linux binaries which are not working as the windows binaries are. 
:D Thanks, VaibhaV VaibhaV The output file was created, but that's all- it was empty. 
If you read the output, tidy said there are errors you need to fix before it can continue. 
It also says what the errors are. 
Ignorance is bliss ;) Of VaibhaV Sharma Hello, I am not exactly sure about this.
