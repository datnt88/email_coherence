Although the EOWG is not meeting in Toronto, several members of the group will be attending WWW8. 
Is anyone in EOWG interested in getting together? 
Jutta is organizing an event for Saturday night for all the W3C people in attendance (about 40!), but I would be happy to organize a small event (brunch or supper at my place/at a restaurant, or whatever) for EOWG people at another time. 
(Thursday or Friday night? 
Sunday morning?) If anyone is interested in getting an insider's tour of Toronto and environs, let me know. 
If I lived in California, I would brag that I was a tour-guide in Atlantis in a previous reincarnation. 
But because I live in Toronto, I will simply say that I really like giving visitors a taste of our neighbourhoods, haunts, routes, architecture, art, geological wonders, and culinary delights. 
Alan Alan, my wife will be hanging around for some days, and if you have the time she would probably be really keen to have an insiders tour. 
I presume I will be a bit busy. 
Sigh. 
But a get-together of some kind would be cool.
