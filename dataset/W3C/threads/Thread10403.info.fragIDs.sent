Hi Folks, I would very much like to say yes to this. 
Can I have volunteers to draft review comments on behalf of rdfcore please. 
Brian Brian, Dan, The TAG is working toward publishing a Last Call working draft of "Architecture of the World Wide Web" [1], editors copy at [2]. 
I'd like to solict a commitment from the RDF Core WG to review our LC draft once published. 
We expect to announce a 3 month LC which we anticipate ending around the time of the Tech Plenary in Cannes (or later if we fail to meet our publication goals). 
Please could you let me know whether RDF Core would be able to undertake a review within such a 3 month window. 
Best regards Stuart Williams [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch [latest WD] [2] http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/webarch [Editors copy - a living document] 
I could sign up for this... 
I plan anyway to review this doc again, when it's stable.
