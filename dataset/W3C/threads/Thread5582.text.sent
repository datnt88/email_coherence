mark Some scenario thoughts on the topic matter; Staff meeting of financial industry work group (assembled on the fly from labor pools) distributed across U.S. and India on production of code for online payment system for auction services which has a deadline in six hours (involving federal regulation of financial transactions). 
Staff members include visually impaired, and hearing impaired engineers, administrative staff with age related short term memory loss, dyslexia, ADD and other cognitive impairments. 
How does the (cognitively impaired) administrative staff managing the phone conference pass the conversation to the deaf programmer and summarize work demands from the conversation, construct the calendar/timeline information? 
Keep the focus on multiple coding documents for the Jaws using visually impaired user? 
Goal is an integrated work group that works to timeline routing and coordinating everyone. 
Staff members must be able to 'understand' appropriate time structure messaging to carry out their part in the deadline workflow. 
Visually impaired staff access all desk top documents with visual content like photographs coming in as a part of identification requirements of payment users, and all staff say on the phone to deaf persons in India what further programming needs to planned for in a secure firewall corporate working environment intranet that is being implemented in 6 hours.
