<s> Phill agrees with the proposed resolution for: 1. "don't do Priority 0" http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG1-PR-issues#Should 2. "Do link checklist to techniques" but I have the following comments on the "suggested wording" for the other two proposed resolutions: 3. "Applicable use of guidelines" I would change the suggested wording in the 12/02 draft from:  </s>

<s> Common sense dictates whether the requirements of a checkpoint exceed the scope of the tool's design.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints that require a tool to implement a functionality are applicable to the tool.  </s>

<s> All authoring tools should support all applicable Web Content Guideline checkpoints, but the nature of that support may vary according to the nature of the authoring tool, the expected skill level of the author using the tool, and the requirements of each WCAG checkpoint.  </s>

<s> In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the Working Group has assumed that "the author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has no prior knowledge of  </s>

<s> For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the  </s>

<s> In today's environment, most authors will not have the appropriate knowledge to create accessible content and it is up to the tool to help them via methods appropriate to the type of authoring tool.  </s>
<s> to PJ proposal : Authoring tools are developed to assist the author in creating Web content and manage sites.  </s>
<s> In assigning priority levels for checkpoints, "the author" or user of the tool is assumed to be aware of the language support and competent, but not necessarily an expert, user of the tool, and has only a nominal knowledge of accessibility.  </s>
