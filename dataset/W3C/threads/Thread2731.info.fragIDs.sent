<s> I think that one way to do this would be to chunk the entire multipart/byteranges response and calculate the MD5 digest while chunking.  </s>
<s> The Authentication-Info header could then be put in a trailer of the chunking.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason not to chunk a multipart/byterange?  </s>
<s> Is doing so consistent with the spec?  </s>
