Bruce Roberts and Chuck Oppermann have raised the question of development cost on this list recently, although it has also been raised in other WAI groups. 
The mission of this group is to produce guidelines which describe how tools can produce content which is accessible, and how the tools themselves can be accessible to disabled users. 
(Paraphrased from the charter.) 
Enforcement of these guidelines and assessment of how much they cost a particular manufacturer to implement are both beyond the scope of the group as currently chartered. 
There are two reasons why I feel that the cost of implementation should remain an issue which is beyond the scope of this group. 
The first is that the group is meant to solve a single problem - what needs to be achieved (in terms of functionality offered to the user, which generally can be achieved in more than one way) for tools to do the two things required. 
The result is a wish-list precisely to the extent that accessibility is an item on a wish-list. 
If a manufacturer wants to produce an accessible tool, then we are here to let them know what functions are needed, and which functions are desirable, in that tool. 
Equally, if a consumer wishes to purchase an accessible tool, then they should be able to use the guidelines to determine whether, or to what extent a particular tool does the things which are necessary and desirable. 
The other reason is that it is not the place of this working group to involve itself in the management of particular tools, which is what would be required to make decisions based on development costs. 
If we were to go down that path, then we would have to look at the available tools, and the cost of implementing each requirement in each of them, and find the best match before making a recommendation. 
In a changing world that is likely to guarantee we don't ever produce a result. 
We could make such a process more efficient, at the possible cost of overall accessibility improvement, by restricting ourselves to products produced by w3c members, but it is equally possible that developers are not going to let each other look carefully into just how their product is developed, how much it costs, and what they have to spend on it. 
(On this point I invite anyone to prove me wrong in sufficient cases to justify a reconsideration of the charter). 
Without this level of information then we are flying blind, and making it up as we go along. 
As Chuck has repeatedly pointed out, that is an error the group should avoid. 
On the other hand, developers may find a requirement very difficult to implement. 
If it is the case that all developers find it difficult to implement, then it may not hapen for a while. 
Too bad for those who need it, and that's that. 
Alternatively some developers may find it easy to comply with a given requirement, while others find it difficult. 
That is what product differentiation means. 
Again, who uses which tools is beyond the scope of this group - we are here to determine what are the important functionalities of those tools, and how important each of those things is.

I cannot agree more with what you said. 
By harping on these two issue we would be limiting the amount of accessibility we could recommend authoring tools contain or produce. 
Especially if we use the excuse "no one will implement it due to the cost incurred." 
Besides, concerned individuals will always step in to help with the enforcement of standards. 
Look at the Web Standards Project. 
They've taken CSS 1 and HTML 4.0 and made the Web development community aware of how unimplemented these recommendations are. 
Currently, Netscape is rewriting their browser to become as compliant as possible and Microsoft has even admitted it now recognizes Web developers as a potential client and user. 
We should not limit ourselves because we think our recommendations will interfere with a company's cost or product-to-market schedule. 
If the companies do not implement our AU Recommendations, a new group will spring up to educate the public to ask for those features or buy a different product.

The argument does cut the other way as well. 
If there is an identified need for a solution which companies claim is too expensive to implement, then it will not be done until somebody demonstrates a good way to do it. 
In the case of speech recognition and machine translation these turned out to be remarkably difficult, and took a very long time to reach maturity. 
However, they are now moving from the wish list to the "well, it works ok until' list, and we can expect them to become trivial to implement at some point in the future. 
If we don't identify an itch, it won't get scratched. 
Let me just reiterate that I am not saying "all developers must be forced to everything and hang the expense". 
I am saying that this group's primary role is to identify the needs of a particular community, and produce guidelines describing how those needs can be met. 
In addition, this group has taken an approach of specifying the relative importance of meeting each of those needs, to give some guidance to developers who are trying to implement the guidelines, generally in a commercial environment where there are many factors at work as to how important each of these strategies is, which I expect will have some bearing on which problems are solved in individual products released by individual developers.

Enforcement of these guidelines and assessment of how much they cost a particular manufacturer to implement are both beyond the scope of the group as currently chartered. 
I agree with this sentiment. 
This problem of "implementation cost" isn't one of creating checkpoints, it's of prioritizing them. 
We can agree that providing a structured view of a document might improve the accessibility of the documentation creation tool for certain users. 
However, the cost of implementing such a feature may be prohibitive. 
When we come to prioritize this checkpoint, I will strongly argue that it should have a low priority. 
Here is why based on my understanding of the current checkpoint: * It only helps document creators and editors, not users of the finished web site * It only helps those document editors using speech output. 
It is of little help to users with mobility impairments or low vision people using screen magnifiers. 
* The degree that it helps those users is unknown and debatable * It's only meaningful in the cases where structure is important. 
The feature would make little sense in products such as Microsoft Access, Excel or Project. 
* The feature already exists in Microsoft Word. 
Does it need to be duplicated in FrontPage? 
So, given that very few people will achieve a dubious benefit, and given that the design, development and testing cost is likely to be quite high, I would recommend to our development teams that they concentrate on the accessibility of new and existing features and fix accessibility problems that affect a larger number of users. 
All software project managers juggle three balls - Time, Resources, Features. 
Time and Resources are finite. 
I have to cut features. 
I will cut the features that have the least benefit to the smallest number of users. 
I want to place my resources where they can have maximum impact and dramatically increase the accessibility of the produced content. 
So, I agree that the discussions of the working group should not be colored by the potential cost of a feature. 
However, when it comes time to prioritize those features, I hope that common sense and practicality will win out. 
Another area where cost should be considered is alternatives. 
If the problem is that the document editor is unaware of the hierarchy of the information, then how can that be presented? 
A structured view is one way, what's another? 
Surely there are other possibilities. 
Jutta mentioned several times yesterday about the visual formatting information. 
However that information is already available to speech output products - why are they not representing that to the end user? 
In short - State the problem. 
Propose some solutions. 
Write the checkpoints. 
Unfortunately, it *appears* that a checkpoint was thought up, put into the document and then everyone is racing around trying to justify it. 
Let's get those justifications into the document. 
Let's get the alternative solutions into the document. 
If we can agree on the problem, and present some possible solutions, each with various trade offs, it becomes much easier to get one of the solutions implemented. 
If the checkpoint is "provide a structured view" with no supporting information or alternatives, then it becomes very unlikely that the problem that some users are having will get solved in any form. 
I can hear Charles, Ian and Jutta say "there is no supporting information currently, but that's only because we didn't get a change to fill that out yet." 
That is where I say your process is faulty. 
Don't put the checkpoints in first. 
Put the problems in first. 
Put potential solutions in next. 
Develop check points based on the solutions. 
Prioritize the checkpoints. 
Don't think of me as rejecting this checkpoint totally. 
I can understand that there might be some benefit. 
Maybe it can be proven that there is greater benefit to a wider range of folks. 
I am absolutely passionate about improving the accessibility of our products and Microsoft's track record bears that out. 
Things that are of lower priority or not practical just serve to distract, dilute and discredit accessibility efforts. 
I will fight that just as passionately. 
Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Microsoft Accessibility and Disabilities Group 
These comments, and therefore my responses, seem only to address the case of navigiation within a single document, not of navigating a series of related documents. 
[snip] * It only helps document creators and editors, not users of the finished web site CMN: This is true. 
One of the two goals of the group is to describe how to do just that. 
It is in the context of what is necessary to help creators and editors of the documents that the priority of this particular feature should be assessed. 
CO: * It only helps those document editors using speech output. 
It is of little help to users with mobility impairments or low vision people using screen magnifiers. 
CMN: Actually the ability to navigate a structured tree, rather than having to work through a document in its complete form, is of specific benefit to people who have mobility impairments, for precisely the same reason - it enables the document to be traversed with much less work. 
In the case of magnified screens (and users with various types of cognitive disability) it is the ability to work with an overview of a document CO: * The degree that it helps those users is unknown and debatable CMN: While we could debate at great length the precise degree to which it helps, and while I expect in the course of our work on these guidelines to debate this and to refine our understanding, it seems that there is clearly value to accessibility. 
We have heard, as we could also deduce from a little thought, that the value is related to the complexity of the material produced. 
About which more after CO: * It's only meaningful in the cases where structure is important. 
The feature would make little sense in products such as Microsoft Access, Excel or Project. 
* The feature already exists in Microsoft Word. 
Does it need to be duplicated in FrontPage? 
CMN: Essentially, that depends on whether Microsoft regards Frontpage as a tool suitable for creating a structured document, or really only worth using for trivial pages. 
(Whether resources are available to justify its inclusion in these tools is a separate issue to whether there is a reason to put it there in the first place). 
No, it isn't that either. 
It is a question which is beyond the scope of the current group. 
The question of prioritisation is, for this group, a question of the degree to which users with disabilities need the feature. 
Prioritisation of checkpoints according to cost, implementation difficulty, etc is intimately bound up in the development and management processes of each developer individually. 
That is beyond the scope of this group, is not an issue I particularly want to spend time on, and is unlikely to be an issue which, unless the companies concerned are prepared to provide substantial detail on their inner workings, (which would surprise me, as I said in my earlier message) this group will ever have sufficient information to approach sensibly anyway. 
As I said earlier today, the offering of alternative solutions is within the scope of this group. 
Charles McCathieNevile I agree with this sentiment. 
This problem of "implementation cost" isn't one of creating checkpoints, it's of prioritizing them. 
This is precisely the job of the working group. 
A problem was outlined at the face to face meeting, was elaborated on during the teleconference, and has been further explained on this list. 
Solutions have been proposed. 
If there are alternatives we are missing, propose them to the list. 
We can only select from the ideas which are available. 
This is, in part, why I am not yet ready to express my ideas as checkpoints. 
The placeholder in the document was put there by agreement of the group at the meeting, with the recognition that we would require further discussion. 
The primary medium for communication within this group is this email list. 
So here we are. 
If the problem is still unclear, or there are better solutions available, please say so. 
If you are merely concerned that this proposal is being given a higher priority than it merits, please allow that to be discussed when that is the question on the agenda.

It's easy to come up with rationales after the fact and find all sorts of neat uses of the proposed feature. 
However, the solution did not grow out of a real need. 
Each item I mentioned can be dissected individually, but when combined show the relative lack of importance/benefit of the proposed feature. 
Also, there is no discussion of possible alternative solutions and how it might compare with the existing checkpoint. 
I'm trying to show that the process for developing checkpoints is flawed, not to eliminate this or any other existing checkpoint. 
All ideas are valid. 
If someone says they need a structure view of the document, web site, Intranet, or the Universe, that's fine with me. 
Tell me why you need it (i.e.: what problem are you currently having that this feature solves) and then let's brainstorm on this feature and some other ways of solving the problem. 
All those solutions should go into the document.

(Whether resources are available to justify its inclusion in these tools is a separate issue to whether there is a reason to put it there in the first place). 
Regarding the benefits of a structure view, I think Chuck has grossly understated them. 
If I have low vision and am magnifying the screen by a power of eight I can see very little on the screen, I need to scroll through many screens to get a sense of the structure and it is easy to get lost. 
A compressed view of the document allows me to both get a good sense of the overall structure and to navigate that structure more easily. 
If I am a switch access user and I need to manuevre through a document I am writing or editing it may take a great many switch hits to get to the place I want to go. 
If I can again compress my document and move to the section of the document, it will save my limited time and energy. 
The other point to make is that as Chuck has stated, although not directly, this "solution" has many "curbcut" advantages and it can be argued that it would benefit all authors (or why would Microsoft put it in so many of their other products). 
Jutta 
Chuck, In a series of messages to the group in the last two weeks you describe (as far as I can tell) the process the group works by, and then you claim that the group has some other, fundamentally flawed process. 
I suggest that if you listen to what happens in meetings and read the background materials (minutes, agendas, list archives, etc) more carefully you will find the process is pretty much what you claim we need. 
If you have material suggestions to offer, please provide them through the list, so they can be discussed in that forum, and thus dealt with efficiently in the limited time available for teleconferences. 
In the case in point - the need for navigation of structure, I refer you yet again to the minutes of the face to face meeting where it was discussed briefly, and a placeholder was left for further discussion, to the explanations given to you during the teleconference, and to the discussion of the problem on the list. 
If you have in fact read all that material, and the problem is still not clear, let me know and I will ensure that a very simple and straightforward description of the problem, which you find clear and comprehensible, is furnished. 
(I would also refer you to the work done by Microsoft in the development of such features for products which are designed to manipulate documents - I assume that there is material which is internally available.) If on the other hand you feel that the current process is so flawed that the group is moving backwards, and the working drafts are successively worse, rather than successive improvements, please point out to us where the problems are most serious, again via the list, for the same reaasons outlined above. 
In the email quoted below you are asking for all solutions to go into the document, yet time and again you claim that we should not just be throwing things in willy-nilly since a large document is less likely to be read. 
See for example the last paragraph of your message yesterday - I find it very difficult to understand what you feel is wrong. 
It seems the point is so subtle as to require seemingly infinite discussion, with negligible practical impact on the workings of the group, except that it has the unfortunate side effect of removing some of our focus from our actual goals. 
If there is a serious problem then this is important. 
But if not then it is consuming an excessive amount of the group's time and energy.

My comments interspersed - look for CMN: and CO: It's easy to come up with rationales after the fact and find all sorts of neat uses of the proposed feature. 
However, the solution did not grow out of a real need. 
CMN: Nonsense. 
Perhaps that need was not clearly enough stated that you could understand it at first, but I think it has been thoroughly discussed. 
Unless you are suggesting that the individuals who make such proposals just think of ideas at random, and that the group discussion on them is based on a complete lack of understanding. 
It's a possibililty I am prepared to entertain in theroy, but I find it hard to reconcile with the evidence and would need considerable guidance. 
CO: Each item I mentioned can be dissected individually, but when combined show the relative lack of importance/benefit of the proposed feature. 
Also, there is no discussion of possible alternative solutions and how it might compare with the existing checkpoint. 
CMN: The point is that a number of claims, each individually spurious, when taken as a group amount to nothing. 
If you would like to contribute to a discussion of alternatives we welcome your input.
