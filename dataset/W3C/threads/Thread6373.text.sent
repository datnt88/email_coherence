Could we please have a little disclaimer/note about why we used tables for layout on the home page? 
maybe next to the WAI Icon, or at least under the "new home page design" news item, while that item is still news.

The new W3C home page design (at http://www.w3.org/) is in fact an example g : table summary="Layout table: The first cell contains the body of the page, the second a navigation bar." border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" Einar HTML 4.01 spec recommends style sheets for visual formatting. 
However, I find some difficulties in making use of CSS level 2. There are many features that popular visual browsers do not support so far. 
It seems that style sheets layers cannot totally replace the use of Table or Frame elements for web page layout. 
Is there any design guideline for layout formatting? 
Could you suggest any site as examples? 
By the way, I notice that commercial sites rely extensively on visual layout/ effects rather than providing a structured document for scientific research. 
Is there any commercial site of valid htmls or good design in the technical aspect? 
Any design guideline for this kind of application? 
Thank you. 
Ching Does my message to site-comments on this topic count [1]? 
I think that calling us "hypocritical" is unfair. 
I am not excited about using a table for layout, believe me. 
Our experiments with trying to design a page that used floats and worked across different browsers on different platforms failed. 
We debated whether we wanted to use floats and take a stand to promote support for specifications, or to use a table and ensure that the page linearized well (as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1]). 
We chose the table as a practical, not purist solution. 
One of the reasons we created this list was to get feedback on how to improve our design, and in particular, how to get rid of the table. 
We hope that people will contribute ideas and that this archive will allow other people to learn about designs that "do the right thing": provide visually appealing solutions that adhere to specifications and meet the needs of all users.

I'm asking for a little "why we used tables for layout..." or "what? 
tables for layout?" 
link down at the bottom of the home page.
