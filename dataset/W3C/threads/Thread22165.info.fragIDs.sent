<s> I'm going over the DOM Level 2 tests and have a question about the systemId attribute within the DocumentType interface.  </s>
<s> Some of the parsers return the absolute URI while others return just the file name.  </s>
<s> Are both valid?  </s>
<s> If not what should be returned?  </s>
<s> Rick Rivello  </s>
<s> Given Phillipe's response, it would appear that the tests as originally written are valid.  </s>
<s> These tests -- one from DOM Level 1 and another in DOM L2, capture the system id as a string -- look backwards in the string for the first occurrence of "/", and then strip off what would be the system id without the baseURI.  </s>
<s> This is done using the java String lastIndexOf method, followed by a subString method.  </s>
<s> In order to add these test cases, we either need to add these language constructs to the schema and language specific transformations, or we could possibly add another assert element, assertURIequals , with corresponding language specific code to do the comparison.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts?  </s>

<s> The DOM specification doesn't say anything about that.  </s>
<s> It is defined as a URI reference by the XML 1.0 specification.  </s>

<s> If I remember things correctly, I think this would be a good issue for an errata that would clarify what should be returned.  </s>
<s> I think all but one parser test (perhaps Crimson) returned the literal contents of the systemId and the remaining one absolutized the URI.  </s>
<s> Definitely the intention of the author is different when they chose to use a relative URI instead of an absolute URI and not preserving that distinction loses information.  </s>
<s> I'll try to confirm the observations on as many parsers as possible.  </s>
<s> Probably be good to clarify it in the InfoSet too.  </s>
<s> To support either decision, I would prefer to have an explicit assertURIEquals element instead of trying to add all the general string processing capabilities to DOM TS ML. assertURI could look like: assertURIEquals actual="somevar" scheme="http|file|..." ?  </s>
<s> path="" ?  </s>
<s> host="" ?  </s>
<s> file="" ?  </s>
<s> query="" ?  </s>
<s> fragment="" ?  </s>
<s> isAbsolute="true | false" ?  </s>
<s> So for the tests that would accept either absolutized or relative URI's, the test would have been:  </s>
