In Appendix C where it is talking about labels for form elements, it says 15. A.12.4. 
For all form controls with labels, ensure that the label that is either: o [239]immediately following its control on the same line (allowing more than one control/label per line). 
o or [240]on the line before the control (with only one label and one control per line). 
In the second list item [link 240] I would have taken this to mean that the label is on one line, the control on the next. 
That is not what you mean. 
I think that fewer people will be confused if you just make it parallel with the first list item o or [240]on the same line but before the control (with only one label and one control per line). 
Actually, I would have listed this as the first choice... Al Shouldn't a exception be made for labels using the LABEL element? 
That's the purpose of the element, to remove the need for user agents and the accessibility aids that run on top of them to "figure out" where the element is. 
With Internet Explorer 4.01 and Active Accessibility, if the LABEL element is used, it doesn't matter what the visual appearance is - the two elements are linked programmatically and the accessibility aid will be aware of it.

Actually, I would have listed this as the first choice... Al For blind access that is true, the LABEL element allows screen readers identify the label of a control even if the two are spatially separated. 
However, grouping them closely together helps people using magnifiers or who have limited field of vision, and I would assume that it also helps people with some types of cognitive impairments.
