<s> Outreach Update: Gave a presentation on accessibility in Rome just before Christmas.  </s>
<s> English and Italian versions will be available by the start of next week.  </s>
<s> Also: Read the Note - it is looking good.  </s>
<s> There is the perennial question of whether we should identify examples of technology that can or can't provide the facilities described in the note - for example there are to my knowledge two screen readers that can provide table navigation as used in one scenario.  </s>
<s> One has been available for months, the other for years but on a system that is not in wide use in offices.  </s>
<s> I believe that at the moment both are still only available in English.  </s>
<s> I am not really sure where this info gets collected.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of an organisation that does it?  </s>
<s> Is there an obvious place in WAI where it is being done the most?  </s>
<s> (The alternative browsing page is cool, but doesn't provide a lot of detail in many cases).  </s>
