<s> Hi, I checkout Amaya and libwww from CVS repository with winCVS 1.2; I try to compile Amaya.  </s>
<s> I generated files *.h and *.def by running Perl  </s>
<s> script, then I build compilers.dsw  </s>
<s> and Thot.  </s>
<s> But I cannot open amaya.dsw.  </s>
<s> How can I sort it out?  </s>
<s> Thanks. Scarica GRATUITAMENTE MSN Explorer dall'indirizzo  </s>
<s> You have to launch Visual Studio then "Open Workspace" and select  </s>
<s> Amaya\Windows\amaya.dsw.  </s>
<s> Yes, but it open compilers.dsw  </s>
<s> yet.  </s>
<s> MSN Photos ?  </s>

<s> In the CVS version things changed.  </s>
<s> Now you can directly open amaya.dsw and select the project compilers.  </s>
<s> When compilers are built a window is displayed.  </s>
<s> You just have to build schemas by F7.  </s>
<s> When all schemas are compiled you can close the window and move to the project amaya and build the application.  </s>
<s> The advantage is to keep the same working space for compilers and the application amaya.  </s>
<s> We'd like to link the end of the schemas compiling with the building of Amaya (it's trivial with Unix Makefiles) but we didn't find out a method to do that with Visual Studio.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
