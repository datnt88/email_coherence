<s> I have had some feedback on the AUS Accessibility Standards  </s>
<s> for Web Design (guidelines for accessibility for Australian Govt websites), in regards to fine-tuning some of the Standards.  </s>
<s> However, I am not certain as to the accuracy of some of these recommendations, therefore, I was hopeful for some expert feedback.  </s>
<s> (1) Do the Height and Width attributes in image tags alter page load time,  </s>
<s> or do they simply load text first?  </s>
<s> (2) Is it the case that the vast majority of web clients wrap ALT text?  </s>
<s> (3) Is it fair to describe the latest version of Lynx as frames capable?  </s>
<s> (4) Finally, does validation also serve the purpose of making a site  </s>
<s> accessible?  </s>

<s> The issue is with formatting.  </s>
<s> You have to load some text first, in order to get the IMG SRC that are  </s>
<s> included.  </s>
<s> But since you don't want to relayout the text after each  </s>
<s> images, it's better to know the size of the image in advance (so you  </s>
<s> reserve the space and move forward in the text stream).  </s>
<s> So yes, putting image size is valuable.  </s>
<s> Note that this can also be done using CSS.  </s>
<s> I don't really know for sure.  </s>
<s> Netscape 3.0 doesn't.  </s>
<s> Don't know.  </s>
<s> What kind of validation ?  </s>
<s> just HTML ?  </s>
<s> I think that Hiram's explanation of point (1) is helpful.  </s>
<s> The person viewing the page gets better incremental-loading  </s>
<s> performance if the sizes are given.  </s>

<s> Not directly related to accessibility, but it also goes a long way toward assuring that the page looks correct regardless of the browser used.  </s>
<s> It ensures you aren't relying on error recovery which exists in your favorite browser but may not exist in a newer version of that same browser or a different browser.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if you were looking for comments on anything other than the last two, but...  </s>
<s> Yes, depending upon the browser, different results may be achieved without  </s>
<s> these attributes.  </s>
<s> In my experience, Netscape will not render text below (or beside) images for which it has no size until it loads enough of the  </s>
<s> image to get the size of the image itself.  </s>
<s> It will then render down to the next image.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer renders the entire text of the page leaving small default sizes for the images.  </s>
<s> When it begins loading the image and figures out its size, it then RE-renders the text and other images as necessary (possibly resulting in MANY redraws).  </s>
<s> With both browsers, if you specify proper HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes, the entire text of the page will be rendered with the correct size for each image.  </s>
<s> When those images are loaded, they will already have a space set aside for  </s>
<s> them.  </s>
<s> To get a perfect example, create a page with 20 or 30 small icons (all different) on a single line (bigger file sizes for the icons will help).  </s>
<s> If you don't put proper attributes on these, you probably won't see ANYTHING until the last image or 2 has begun loading (depends on the browser settings for the number of simultaneous connections).  </s>
<s> If you put the attributes in, the page will at least appear and show each icon as it loads.  </s>
<s> Your mileage may vary depending on the browser, but in all cases, the  </s>
<s> attributes do speed up the time before the page is actually usable.  </s>
<s> I haven't given any thought to this, but I assume that this would be the  </s>
<s> case unless nbsp's are included in the ALT text.  </s>

<s> (3) Is it fair to describe the latest version of Lynx as frames capable?  </s>
<s> It is at least fair to say it is frames-copable.  </s>
<s> Lynx now presents the contents of frames much as if they were separate HTML documents.  </s>
<s> With a little care for the naming of the frames, this can be quite usable.  </s>
