I've tossed around a variety of wordings and considered whether some of these should be checkpoints or techniques. 
The main guideline is: "Integrate accesibility solutions into the overall "look and feel"" Existing checkpoint is: 2.4.2 [Priority 2] Integrate accessibility features into the overall "look and feel" of the authoring tool. 
Should this one go entirely, as it is just the same as the main guideline? 
Or should one or the other be rewritten? 
Proposed checkpoints: 2.4.X [Priority 2] Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting choices for the author. 
TECHNIQUE: If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and make it the default. 
2.4.X [Priority 1] Ensure that accessibility features can be easily accessed by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion. 
TECHNIQUES: Include considerations for accessibility -- such as the ALT and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG element -- right below the SRC attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an "Advanced..." button. 
Allow efficient and fast access to accessibility-related settings with as few steps as possible needed to make any changes that will generate accessible content. 
2.4.X [Priority 1] Make generation of accessible content a naturally integrated part of the authoring process. 
TECHNIQUES: Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core operation of the authoring tool. 
The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring tool should favor accessible solutions out of the box, for the benefit of newer users. 
Thoughts?

I like it. 
I think some examples should be added to the techniques, but it is a little late in Boston and I have an early start, so I might work on them tomorrow.

I like all the techniques Kynn has given, and think I like the wording of the third checkpoint better than the wording of the second - the wording of the second could be a technique for the third. 
Anyway, I have added some more technique suggestions - look for CMN: and KB: Charles McCN [background discussion snipped] 2.4.X [Priority 2] Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting choices for the author. 
TECHNIQUE: If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and make it the default. 
CMN: For example, When requesting alternative content for an image, offer an unchecked option for empty alternative (ie ALT="" - the image has no real function) with the cursor positioned in the text entry for an ALT value, rather than offering the filename as a default suggestion, with the null ALT value selected. 
KB: 2.4.X [Priority 1] Ensure that accessibility features can be easily accessed by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion. 
TECHNIQUES: Include considerations for accessibility -- such as the ALT and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG element -- right below the SRC attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an "Advanced..." button. 
Allow efficient and fast access to accessibility-related settings with as few steps as possible needed to make any changes that will generate accessible content. 
2.4.X [Priority 1] Make generation of accessible content a naturally integrated part of the authoring process. 
TECHNIQUES: Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core operation of the authoring tool. 
The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring tool should favor accessible solutions out of the box, for the benefit of newer users. 
CMN: Examples: A help page which describes how to make an imagemap should include adding alternative content for each AREA in the MAP as part of the process. 
Any examples of code should give either block content with text links, or AREAs which all have relevant ALT attribute values. 
When a user creates a frameset, suggest the main content page and a navigation bar as the content for NOFRAMES. 
KB: Thoughts?
