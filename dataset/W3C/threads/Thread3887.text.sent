Hello public-iri, These editorial comments relate to From the new appendix A New schemes are not needed to distinguish URIs from true IRIs (i.e. IRIs that contain non-ASCII characters). 
The benefit of being able to detect the origin of percent-encodings is marginal, also because UTF-8 can be detected with very high reliably. 
Deploying new schemes is extremely hard. 
Not needing new schemes for IRIs makes deployment of IRIs vastly easier. 
Making conversion scheme-dependent is highly unadvisable. 
Using an uniform convention for conversion from IRIs to URIs makes IRI implementation orthogonal from the introduction of acual new schemes. 
I suggest some slight wording and spelling changes (editorial) New schemes are not needed to distinguish URIs from true IRIs (i.e. IRIs that contain non-ASCII characters).

Deploying new schemes is extremely hard, so not requiring new schemes for IRIs makes deployment of IRIs vastly easier. 
Making conversion scheme-dependent is highly inadvisable, and would be encouraged by such an approach. 
Using an uniform convention for conversion from IRIs to URIs makes IRI implementation orthogonal to the introduction of actual new schemes. 
It might also be added that the TAG recommends not adding new schemes that are almost exactly like HTTP; i:http: or httpi: would have exactly that problem. 
UTF-8 avoids a double layering and overloading of the use of the "+" character. 
UTF-8 is fully compatible with US-ASCII, and has therefore been recommended by the IETF, and is being used widely, while UTF-7 has never been used much and is now clearly being discouraged. 
I suggest a small change Using UTF-8 avoids a double layering and overloading of the use of the "+" character. 
UTF-8 is fully compatible with US-ASCII, and has therefore been recommended by the IETF, and is being used widely, while UTF-7 has never been used much and is now clearly being discouraged. 
You might also mention here that using UTF-8 here is existing practice and that requiring implementations to convert to the rarely used UTF-7 is an additional implementation burden. 
The arguments against using %u and against inline encoding declarations are well made. 
In 3.1 Mapping of IRIs to URIs, the renumbering of the sub steps in step two is clearer than in the previous draft.

Chair, W3C SVG Working Group Member, W3C Technical Architecture Group Hello Chris, Many thanks for your comments. 
Because they are all editorial, I have kept them as a single issue. 
[http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/#editorial-Lilley-27] 
Up to now, I haven't usually 'issuefied' editorial stuff, but I'm starting to do that to document what has happened in last call. 
Changed. 
I replaced "by such an approach" with "by separate schemes for IRIs" to make things even clearer. 
Do you have a reference? 
I'd like to give the underlying argument rather than just saying 'the TAG said'. 
Do you mean in the context of URIs, or much more general? 
The subsection starts out with "At an early stage, UTF-7 was considered", and in that context, it wouldn't be true. 
The fact that many URI schemes now use UTF-8 in one way or another is largely due to the decision to use UTF-8 for IRIs, and to the general rise of UTF-8. 
That's a good point. 
I added: "Requiring implementations to convert from UTF-8 to UTF-7 and back would be an additional implementation burden." 
Thanks! 
Thanks. 
That was a private suggestion from Chris Haynes. 
In that case probably http://big.example.com/PopularPage.html. 
Done. 
[I made that example.com, even though all other examples are example.org, 
but I guess in that case, that's justified.] 
Regards, Martin.

URI Schemes Good practice: New URI schemes A specification SHOULD NOT introduce a new URI scheme when an existing scheme provides the desired properties of identifiers and their relation to resources MD Do you mean in the context of URIs, or much more general? 
Both. 
MD The subsection starts out with "At an early stage, UTF-7 was considered", MD and in that context, it wouldn't be true. 
The fact that many URI MD schemes now use UTF-8 in one way or another is largely due to the decision MD to use UTF-8 for IRIs, and to the general rise of UTF-8. 
So its circular. 
Okay. 
MD That's a good point. 
I added: MD "Requiring implementations to convert from UTF-8 MD to UTF-7 and back would be an additional implementation burden." 
Great. 
MD Thanks!

Yes, thats fine. 
Thank you, I am satisfied by the response to all my comments.

Chair, W3C SVG Working Group Member, W3C Technical Architecture Group Hello Chris, Many thanks for your response. 
Thanks. 
I have decided to not reference it, although in theory, a reference to 'work in progress' could be okay even for a Standards Track document. 
But I think it's good to have this here in the mailing list for potential future reference. 
As for the underlying arguments, I think the current text already provides them, although of course in a very compact fashion. 
I have closed this issue. 
Regards, Martin.
