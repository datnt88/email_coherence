<s> We have a meeting this afternoon - +1.617.252.7000  </s>
<s> Agenda question is whether we are going to have a face to face meeting and where.  </s>
<s> Reminder that since W3C process requires 8 weeks notice of meetings we need to get this organised pretty quickly if we are looking at October - so we need dates, places, and hosts.  </s>
<s> Also, we welcome Matthias Mueller-Prove from the Adobe GoLive team (the ue should be a u-umlaut, but I don't have that in this keyboard setup) to the working group.  </s>
<s> People who were at the face to face in Amsterdam will have met Matthias already.  </s>
<s> I will also briefly discuss the move to database-backing for the reviews page, and when we can expect a testing document draft (soon I hope :-) Please send regrets to the list.  </s>
