<s> A client wishes to discover resources which are denoted by URIs which match a particular regular expression and obtain descriptions of those resources.  </s>
<s> The client is aware of a source of knowledge from which such resources might be discovered.  </s>
<s> Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a query which describes one or more example templates which reflect the desired characteristics and submits the query to the knowledge source.  </s>
<s> The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more resource descriptions, each description describing a resource which matched an example template.  </s>
