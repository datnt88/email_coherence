I emerge from a pile of work and try to dive into ATAG things but find I don't know if the pool has water in it. 
:) No meeting today? 
Do we need to check over a final document (the one posted 12/22) or are we still editing? 
I feel so lost, what should I be doing right now?

Dear blond Kynn, You should be signing off on the latest draft (currently 22 Dec) so that we can actually finish this process. 
(so should everyone else, but so far I am the only person whose explicit sign-off i have seen :-( Please note that in producing another draft there may be rather minor editorial amendments made. 
However suggestions of minor edits to be made before people sign off are at this stage holding up the process. 
(The definition of editorial amendment that we are working on is that it could be done or ignored and the documnt would not be materially different) cheers Charles McCN Australian blond.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI 21 Mitchell Street, Footscray, VIC 3011, Australia (I've moved!) How is that done, specifically? 
(I'm asking "out loud" because you say that few other people have explicitly signed off, so I'm wondering if perhaps there's some confusion about how to do that.) Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://www.kynn.com/

Fair question... Write to the list and say "I'm now signing off on the draft - I think it's fine".

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI 21 Mitchell Street, Footscray, VIC 3011, Australia (I've moved!) Could everyone in the group sign off on the present document by Monday, January 3rd, 2000 at 4pm Eastern Time. 
This should be done by sending a message to the list saying that you sign off. 
As Charles stated there may be very minor editorial changes occuring to the document between then and now, these will not be changes that affect the document content or intention. 
Thanks Jutta and have a happy new year! 
Happy New Year everyone, from Oz, where it is now 1900. 
(I think) And yes, it would be nice to get explicit sign-offs. 
I know some people are going to in the next few days, but if you hadn't thought about it please get your fingers on the keyboards... Cheers Chaals Could everyone in the group sign off on the present document by Monday, January 3rd, 2000 at 4pm Eastern Time.

(W) 609-734-5615 (Voice) I have yet to go through them personally. 
If they involve harmonization of terminology, I support them and consider them editorial. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Phill send his approval. 
P.S. "signing off" sounds too much like "logging off", so I choose the term "approval". 
With Y2K and everything I thought people were "logging off" on the list... smile , Speaking of Y2K, I really liked the fireworks in Sydney [as seen from TV]. Regards, Phill Jenkins
