ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Section 4.6.1 in the current Web Contents talks about grouping links: Information on the GL issue list can be found at: Jon Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign 1207 S.

I found the reference I have been wanting us not to lose. 
This is the point where we were talking about structural navigation on the UA list and Jim Thatcher had to raise the skip-navigation hyperlink technique, because he rates this as the single author technique with the greatest bang for the buck, bar none. 
I guess I have to qualify that as bang equals benefit to the users of speech and braille screen readers. 
But still, one has to reflect on why he says that. 
The Issues List points at the start of Paul Adelson's straw poll on the WAI-IG list on this problem; the results are summarized at: This mostly reminds us that we need to do _something_ because there is a real problem. 
The skip-navigation hyperlink can serve as the advance guard of our promotional campaign, because it offers such a short path into genuine "thank-you" territory. 
It is easy for sites to do, it works right away with current browsers, and it makes a whale of a difference. 
Never underestimate the power of "thank you." 
This one technique by itself might just generate thank-you email to webmasters. 
If this technique has that potential, it is not clear we want to blunt our impact by digressing into harder techniques that do a yet better job after and only if user agents (browsers and/or layered helpers) implement the matching techniques. 
User agent techniques that depend on sympathetic authors are not going to fix the pages from the ignorant and un-converted. 
Did I hear there is a screen reader already out there that has implemented some sort of skip-navigation heuristic algorithm? 
There is an IE power toy that does an automatic table-of-contents sidebar, isn't there? 
How much of the sidebar does it devote to the head of page navigation links? 
Does it minimize that? 
How?
