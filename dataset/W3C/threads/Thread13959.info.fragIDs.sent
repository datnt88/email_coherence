<s> A small point:  </s>

<s> When using the OBJECT element, specify alternative text within the "title" attribute or within the body of the OBJECT element.  </s>
<s> I think there needs to be more of a description here of why you want to put text in the title vs. the body of the object.  </s>

<s> Further to Josh's comment, why should the textual alternative be included in the TITLE attribute of OBJECT?  </s>
<s> If I remember the HTML 4.0 specification  </s>
<s> correctly, an empty OBJECT element (one that contains no content) is not permitted.  </s>
<s> Thus, the guideline should state that the alternative text  </s>
<s> belongs in the content of OBJECT, and that authors may wish to include a brief label for the resource in the TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> Some user agents may  </s>
<s> simply present the title, and leave it to the user's discretion to decide whether to read the more detailed text which is included in the content of OBJECT.  </s>
<s> LQ:: It shouldn't.  </s>
<s> The TITLE gives a title for the OBJECT, just as TITLE does with any other element.  </s>
<s> Alternative text is not a title.  </s>
<s> JW::  </s>
<s> LQ:: OBJECT can have no content, as in the following example: A content-free OBJECT would be appropriate when embedding a purely decorative object--there is no alternative content because the object is not content.  </s>
<s> JW::  </s>
<s> LQ:: Agreed.  </s>
