<s> Is someone else in the group receiving the same files?  </s>

<s> In other words, there is very little we can do about it at W3C... I will, nevertheless, forward this to our system management.  </s>

<s> This is a common present day phenomena!  </s>
<s> Malicious attachments/emails are targeted towards email lists, W3C is no exception.  </s>
<s> I suggest that you get a good antisapm software which will allow you to direct emails sent by one particular sender/group to a separate folder where they can be safely deleted.  </s>
<s> Also Enable Worm Blocking (Norton); Enables Worm Blocking to scan all outgoing email messages and alert you if a malicious worm is detected.  </s>
<s> Norton antivirus software allows you to see the details of a sender of a malicious email/attachment, use this to create a message rule in Outlook so as messages from the same sender are deleted from the server.  </s>
<s> Keep your Live Update up to date and PRAY!  </s>

<s> Thank you so much to everybody!  </s>
<s> I do have a good antivirus, update it daily, say all the prayers, etc.  </s>
<s> And still cross fingers!  </s>
<s> :-( These messages from "ezequiel martin gurevich", whoever he is, are always sent to the list, among others.  </s>
<s> What really caught my attention is the fact that the sender's name is always the same, although the email addresses are always different.  </s>
<s> I just wanted to share a concern with all of you.  </s>
<s> Thanks again and best regards to all, cristina  </s>
