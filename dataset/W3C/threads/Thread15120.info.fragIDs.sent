<s> Found it: in the 20 June 2002 - WCAG WG Teleconference Minutes  </s>
<s> "Wide applicability" is what the crytira for proritisation of success  </s>
<s> cytirea that was used to asume that putting in hebrew vowels could not be  </s>
<s> level one.  </s>
<s> I think we need to clarifie what that does and does not mean and more to the point does it include that: "If every page in Israel has to be changed " should disqualifie a requirment  </s>
<s> as level one.  </s>
<s> By the way,if we go with that then there are no level one requirments.  </s>
<s> Look at the Israely access orgenisatins and lobbiests and both sites are not at all slightly minimumly accesible (I am working with them to improve - they are willing but had not heard of  </s>
<s> web accesibilty).  </s>
<s> all the best Lisa  </s>
<s> mappingtechnology-specificsto success criteria Jason I completely agree.  </s>
<s> I think many people in the group would also agree  </s>
<s> with you.  </s>
<s> I bring this up because it was explained to me on a recent teleconference  </s>
<s> (where we were discussing Hebrew vowels) that our conditions for a  </s>
<s> requirement to be level one success criteria include that it is commonly  </s>
<s> implemented. can we clarify that this condition does not, at this time, achieve consensus?  </s>
<s> all the best, Lisa  </s>
<s> I think that you are on to a good thing Joe, but I think your examples  </s>
<s> are  </s>
<s> not quite right.  </s>
<s> The place were i feel there is an over dependence on  </s>
<s> what  </s>
<s> is "commonly used" is in placement of success criteria.  </s>
<s> The priority leveling of success criteria are dependent on the extent which a  </s>
<s> requirement  </s>
<s> is already commonly implemented.  </s>
<s> In other words, if a requirement is not already widely implemented it will be lower priority.  </s>
<s> In general I don't think our success criteria are guilty of this, though anyone who thinks they are is welcome, indeed encouraged, to point out places where it occurs.  </s>
<s> The other issue to bear in mind here is that WCAG also provides the basis of the requirements in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines; the priorities in WCAG have a significant impact on the requirements and priorities of UAAG.  </s>
<s> Thus if we were to set priorities on the basis of what is commonly implemented, the effect would be (1) that authors aiming for level 1 conformance would not implement them; (2) that they would be of lower priority in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines; and (3) because of (1) and (2), user agent and authoring tool developers would be less inclined to implement them, resulting in a self-reinforcing cycle of non-implementation, independently of other motives that are likely to influence developers.  </s>

<s> Hi Lisa "Wide applicability" and "commonly used" are not the same.  </s>
<s> They actually mean quite different things.  </s>
<s> Wide applicability means that it would apply across websites.  </s>
<s> It doesn't mean that it is in fact used or commonly used.  </s>
<s> (though I hope we wouldn't require something that isn't used) And the discussion about Israel was not about the fact that every page had to be changed.  </s>
<s> It had to do with determining if it was indeed necessary to disambiguate the words.  </s>

<s> My memory concurs with Gregg's: the issue was whether tools had been created or could feasibly be created, with reasonable time and effort, to solve the problem, and could then be available at no (or low) cost.  </s>
<s> Given the tools, the problem would no longer reside with the content developer.  </s>
<s> The proposal was: let's not make this a priority 1 item for the author unless it is shown to be necessary (i.e., a technological solution isn't feasible).  </s>
