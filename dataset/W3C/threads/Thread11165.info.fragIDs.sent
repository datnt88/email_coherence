<s> But neither traversal or action is at the right level of generality.  </s>
<s> [See next message about traversal] Both you and Martin are too focussed, in my view, on browsers and mouse clicks.  </s>
<s> As a possibly useful example, consider the case of external, non-participating 2-ended links to annotate the translation relationship between the sentences of french and english versions of a bilingual document.  </s>
<s> A terminology extraction tool will exploit the semantics of such a link (i.e. behave in a certain way) completely differently to a translation tutorial program.  </s>

<s> Those of us in the business of being broken records appreciate another voice joining us in...  </s>
<s> I realise this is dragging us back towards the whole link {semantics/type/behaviour} debate, which I have done my best to follow, but it leaves me feeling that although we need to clearly distinguish between 1) intrinsic XML semantics for links, i.e. termini, participation, etc.; 2) XML Application (in the strict SGML sense of 'application') semantics, e.g. the bilingual alignment example above; 3) Implemented application behaviour we are only in the business of specifying (1).  </s>
<s> And we need to specify clearly what is involved in binding 1 - 2 and 3.  </s>
<s> That is the effort currently called stylesheet that needs a different name, desperately.  </s>
<s> Just for kicks how about using "Display and processing spec" to replace the linking +formatting language I keep referring to as a style sheet?  </s>

<s> But note that historically by far and away the most common language for defining large-A Applications is NATURAL language---English, German, Japanese, whatever.  </s>
