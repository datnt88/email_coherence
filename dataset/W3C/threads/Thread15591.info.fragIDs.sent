<s> Should anyone be interested, Reuven and Wendy have brilliantly forwarded private E-mail to the list.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't do that to them.  </s>
<s> Nice move, Reuven and Wendy!  </s>
<s> Would you also like to rifle through my underwear drawer?  </s>
<s> I'm certainly not going to forget this happened, *Wendy*.  </s>

<s> Hello Joe, First of all I would like to apologies if I offended you in any way.  </s>
<s> My talk with you was not private.  </s>
<s> It started from something I posted to the list.  </s>
<s> I accidentally sent a reply to your posting only to you instead of to the list.  </s>
<s> I thought the discussion needs still to address the whole list so I posted back my replies to the list.  </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that each call has two ends.  </s>
<s> Your private email is private as long as you do not send it to anyone.  </s>
<s> Once it reaches another person, he can do with it what ever he like.  </s>
<s> You can ask for the email to be kept private and usually the second person should comply but this is not the case.  </s>
<s> I am here to develop accessibility guidelines and I hope to be able to do it.  </s>
<s> There is no room for private interest which can not be published in the list.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Reuven Nisser Ofek Liyladenu  </s>
<s> Dear Reuven: Please do not post private messages to WAI lists in the future.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your cooperation.  </s>
<s> Regards, - Judy  </s>
