<s> Hi, I think I've found a couple of typos in RFC 2518.  </s>
<s> Specifically: Page 24, Section 8.1.1,  </s>
<s> RFC 2518:  </s>
<s> Response  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status Content-Length: xxxx [snip] Here, this should read: as otherwise, the namespace definition of R: will be out of scope by the time the R:DingALing/ tag is encountered.  </s>
<s> And, on page 91: [snip] 23.4.2 Meaning of Qualified Names [Note to the reader: This section does not appear in [REC-XML-NAMES], but is necessary to avoid ambiguity for WebDAV XML processors.]  </s>
<s> WebDAV compliant XML processors MUST interpret a qualified name as a URI constructed by appending the LocalPart to the namespace name URI. Example Johnny Updraft In this example, the qualified element name "del:glider" is interpreted as the URL "http://www.del.jensen.org/glider".  </s>
<s> Johnny Updraft [snip] In the second example, the line: should read: as otherwise the XML namespace bar is undefined, and a namespace validating parser will barf.  </s>
<s> Can someone shed some light on these.  </s>
<s> Are they typos or have I missed something?  </s>

<s> Ben,  </s>
<s> These are already known issues (the first is "MISSING_NS_SPEC" and the second is "NS_BOOBOO") in the RFC2518 issues list (http://www.webdav.org/wg/rfcdev/issues.htm).  </s>
<s> All RFC2518 readers should (and, I suggest, all implementers 'must') read  </s>

<s> I've notified the editors of that site, so hopefully they'll add some relevant errata entries and no-one else'll get caught by that.  </s>
