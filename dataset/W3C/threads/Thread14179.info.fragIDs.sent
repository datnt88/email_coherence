<s> I cannot think of a guideline which is specific to Maths/Science.  </s>
<s> In so far as the content is conveyed by images, animations, markup languages, applets and complex language, i think the problem is already addressed.  </s>
<s> As I recall the teleconference it was resolved that we would attempt tobroaden some of the examples away from images and towards some of the other areas, such as equations of various kinds, which are important to groups who don't have a 'guideline just for them'.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Historians are not represented very well either.  </s>
<s> I don't think the argument that visibility is important beats the argument that accurately reflecting the requirements for accessibility as concisely as possible is the best approach for these guidelines.  </s>
<s> Getting people to read the guidelines, and interpreting them for specific groups, seems to me primarily the responsibility of the Education and Outreach group, once the Guidelines group has given them the best possible material.  </s>
<s> It may be that the EO group requests the PAGL group to produce a specific interpretation for some group such as chemistry teachers, but that seems to be beyond the scope of the current PAGL group.  </s>

<s> Issue 1: The specific recommendations on how to author mathematical representations.  </s>
<s> Issue 2: Where will the recommendations appear in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Will there be a guideline (primary document) directly referencing math, or will math be mentioned only in the techniques document( examples of how to do things)?  </s>

<s> The only unique aspect, so far as markup is concerned, is the mathematical notation; and we have already devised solution strategies in this area, namelY: Interim: where images are used to convey mathematical content, provide an equivalent markup notation (E.G. TeX) as alternative text.  </s>
<s> 2. Use MathML to represent mathematics.  </s>
<s> These requirements can be absorbed into the existing guidelines.  </s>
<s> I agree with Charles that what is needed is at most a checkpoint or two, and not a separate guideline.  </s>
<s> The second point, concerning alternative text, can be added as a checkpoint to A1: "Until the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) is widely supported by browsers, images, accompanied by alternative text, may be used to represent mathematical content.  </s>
<s> In such cases, the ALT text should convey the mathematical symbols using a human-readable markup notation, E.G. TeX." (Priority 1).  </s>
<s> Explanation of priority: the information will be inaccessible if the the alternative text is not included.  </s>
<s> Second suggestion, under guideline A14, provide either (1) an informative, non-exhaustive list of W3C technologies: "Note: W3C technologies include HTML, XML, CSS, XSL, MathML, Smil, etc.", or (2) a link to such an informative list, maintained in the techniques document or elsewhere.  </s>
<s> The list should include MathML just for the sake of reinforcing its importance.  </s>
<s> It could even be included briefly in the statement of guideline A14: "(E.G. HTML, CSS, XSL, XML, MathML, SMIL, etc.)".  </s>
<s> Having re-read Charles' comments, I would be willing to agree with the proposal to include mention of MathML in the introduction to Section A, rather than in A14 as discussed in my previous message.  </s>
