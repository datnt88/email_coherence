I guess it may be priority setting time for next version of Amaya! 
My personal wish list is for: 1] Completion of the CSS 1 recommendation 2] Completion of the html 4.01 recommendation 3] More mathml character entities... dont know whether this is a STIX problem or a Unicode one but quite a few basic entities are missing. 
Mind you everyone is in catchup mode with new recommendation.

John, I generally just lurk on this list as I've been following the development of Amaya in the hope that eventually it will be a useful tool for our operation. 
It's getting there, but it's not ready for me to recommend it as a replacement for the editor tools we currently use. 
I'm interested in your comment in your "wish list" below about a need to complete the HTML 4.01 Recommendation. 
Given that both Amaya and W3C are geared toward XHTML in all its evolving forms, why do we need further work on HTML 4.01? 
Hasn't it been superseded by XHTML and shouldn't work on Amaya 
be focused solely on implementing the various XHTML Recommendations rather than going back to a now superseded standard?

Amaya 
The XHTML 1.0 standard depends upon &amp; incorporates the HTML 4.01 standard. 
That's one reason. 
As a long-time user, the things that I think would most like to see the Amaya team complete are 1. HTML 4.01/XHTML 1.0 support 2. CSS 1 support 3. Unicode support 4. Annotea 5. MathML support 6. SVG support (that's my order of preferences). 
There's no need for frames support, as Amaya is not a consumer browser; and anyone who wants Amaya users to see their pages shouldn't use frames anyway (they're bad authoring practice) or should at least provide the "noframes" mechanism.

html 4.01 forms the foundation for much of xhtml and the docs i have seen for xhtml1.1 and xhtml-basic all point back to html4.01 for specifics... is there an xhtml doc that is complete within itself please point me to it if so else i look on getting the specific functionality correct. 
most of what i see so far is tightening of rules and dropping redundant or obsolete ways of doing things... but i sure would like to see the basic functionality there .... and once again if you can point me at xhtml recommendation that stand alone (without referring back to html 4) please point me that way and i will use in my bug tracking... as a reference point for some of the things i am tracking look at
