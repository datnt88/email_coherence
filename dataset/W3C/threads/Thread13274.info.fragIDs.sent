Hello, On the ER IG/WG call today we discussed how to prevent an author from receiving warnings for manual checks between sessions if the author has already performed the manual check. 
If a tool maintained results in meta data for each file (or site) that is checked/repaired by a tool this would be useful for a number of reasons: 1. generating conformance claims to WCAG 2. keeping track of what the user has yet to fix or has fixed and thus reducing the numbers of repeat alerts they may get for a particular element. 
Have these issues been discussed in this group? 
If so, please point us to the resolutions.

This has not been discussed as requiring any resolution in the AUWG. 
The benefits mentioned are valuable, particularly the ability to generateWCAG conformance evaluation semi-automagically at least. 
In the context of Authoring Tool Guidelines this woul fall under the rubric of techniques for checking for accessibility, in particular across sessions.

Is it really appropriate that it be the responsibility of whoever (wherever) is *hosting* the tool have the responsibility of tracking each file/site that has been checked/repaired? 
Does the W3C Validator keep a log of who uses it and if they passed or not what errors they had and did they visit again? 
I am not sure that cookies would be a good mechanism for this either. 
The ability to address this feature *is* very important. 
IMHO, the lack of this option severely limits the utility of Bobby. 
Probably the way a Bobby-like program should work is with a command line option to dismiss certain tests/checks that the page *author* is sure have been addressed.

In the context of an authoring tool I think it is extremely appropriate. 
Tools like Word keep large amounts of information about documets across editing sessions. 
In the case of an ER tool it is likely to be more difficult (cookies are indded a good approach) butit is still very valuable as a service to the author.
