<s> Hello, On the ER IG/WG call today we discussed how to prevent an author from receiving warnings for manual checks between sessions if the author has already performed the manual check.  </s>
<s> If a tool maintained results in meta data for each file (or site) that is checked/repaired by a tool this would be useful for a number of reasons: 1. generating conformance claims to WCAG 2. keeping track of what the user has yet to fix or has fixed and thus reducing the numbers of repeat alerts they may get for a particular element.  </s>
<s> Have these issues been discussed in this group?  </s>
<s> If so, please point us to the resolutions.  </s>

<s> This has not been discussed as requiring any resolution in the AUWG.  </s>
<s> The benefits mentioned are valuable, particularly the ability to generateWCAG conformance evaluation semi-automagically at least.  </s>
<s> In the context of Authoring Tool Guidelines this woul fall under the rubric of techniques for checking for accessibility, in particular across sessions.  </s>
