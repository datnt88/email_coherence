The People! Has anyone checked the terms in the Terminology section of W3C's XHTML 1.0 spec? 
To my mind the spec contains not the explained terms. 
So, is there a need in them? 
Maybe you have to put the needed ones into the XHTML 1.1 spec? 
Buy, with best wishes, Croll.

XHTML 1.0 is the reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML. 
So all terms are explained in HTML 4.01. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- Hello dear Sir, there has been a misunderstanding between us recently. 
I wanted to say that some terms in the Terminology section of XHTML 1.0 are not CONTAINED in the spec itself. 
Don't remember exactly, but it was "implementation-defined" I think. 
Do you agree? 
Regards, Croll.
