Thanks to Greg Lowney for important info on color blindness in "But Can They Read It." That material explains a lot, but doesn't repeat specific color choice contrasts and reasons as in your primary reference. 
That reference gives examples, then explains the three dimensions available for choosing colors: lightness, hue, and saturation in a three-dimensional color space. 
[My paraphrase: Lightness is grey scale, white to black top to bottom. 
Hue is spectrum of colors of rainbow, joined onto itself around a circle at red-violet. 
Saturation is color intensity: grey at center to only pure color radially at the outside.] 
The three recommendations there are illustrated: 1. Exaggerate lightness differences between foreground and background colors, and avoid using colors of similar lightness adjacent to one another, even if they differ in saturation or hue. 2. Choose dark colors with hues from the bottom half of the hue circle in Figure 7 against light colors from the top half of the circle (or white). 
Avoid contrasting light colors from the bottom half against dark colors from the top half (or black). 
3. Avoid contrasting hues from adjacent parts of the hue circle, especially if the colors do not contrast sharply in lightness. 
I found another good reference: Web Page Design for Colour Blind Readers Included there are a different list of DO's and DONT's that would be useful for WAI guidelines, with specific color problems identified. 
DO provide ALT="..." text for all your images. 
If a user cannot understand your image they can reload with images off. 
Consider using JavaScript MouseOver events to provide status-line descriptions of images- especially maps and navigation bars. 
DON'T use [red | green | brown | grey | purple] [next to | on top of | changing to] [red | green | brown | grey | purple]. 
DO have a strong, bright contrast between foreground and background colours- not only for your page text but also in your images. 
Even totally colour blind readers can differentiate similar colours which contrast bright with dark. 
DON'T use colours in images to denote special areas, such as bar charts, maps and navigation bars. 
Consider using textures or line shading instead (try the "paper" or "pattern" function in your graph or painting program). 
Alternatively, provide additional written labels. 
DO use blue, yellow, white and black if you really must use colours to distinguish items. 
These combinations are less likely to be confused than others.

In the era of stylesheets color blind people may override all author defined colors, asuming their browsers are designed for usability. 
To a large extent this would be a solution. 
There are web creatures in which you cannot override colors, e.g., images of types used nowadays. 
(vector graphics may be different) Also some older browsers do not allow to override colors defined via table cells (TD) or the FONT element. 
And some recognize the FONT color, but not the TD background color. 
So my recommendation is first to promote the usage of stylesheets for colors (without restrictions concerning color blidness) and put all the color blind restrictions with respect to images. 
Using FONT and TD for colors should be generally discouraged as it gives trouble to everyone.

Thanks Harvey, As you probably saw, the primary emphasis of my article was on making colors configurable by the user so they can adjust the presentation for their needs. 
I think we all agree that a well-designed Web page should be usable when the user overrides the author's colors. 
For us to be successful, it's important that our recommendations allow authors and designers to keep control of and have great freedom to choose the default presentation, as long as the user can override it without causing problems. 
Images and printed documents are really the only places where the user should have to deal with fixed colors, and so that's where selecting colors according to the guidelines below becomes important. 
Beacuse of space limitations I could not go into detail on every aspect, so I'm very glad that more detailed references like the ones below exist. 
A few other comments: * Why recommend using MouseOver to give additional information about images, when TITLE= already does this? 
(Actually, today neither helps users who rely on the keyboard...) * The specific guidelines below on avoiding red/green combinations is one good example, but we have to be careful not to reinforce the common misconception that red/green combinations are the only problem area.
