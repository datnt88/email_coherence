Folks, I've an internet-draft ([1] for the sacred WG) which is in the RFC editor's author's 48 state. 
It contains an XML schema, which contains the following fragment: import namespace="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" schemaLocation="../W3C/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd"/ The RFC editor pointed out that their schema checker objects to the schemaLocation value above since they don't have a dsig core schema at that relative location. 
The schemaLocation attribute is however just a hint [2], so the schema passes using the checker on the w3c site. 
From memory, this is the result of the schema checker I used to use (in a previous job) which I needed to be able to use offline. 
No one's noticed this until now, but then again, I'm not sure how many people have tried to write code for this protocol (few at any rate). 
So, the question:- - is it ok as is? 
- should I change the value of schemaLocation to use an absolute URL, in particular [3]? 
I assume the latter is better. 
Can you cc' me on any responses - I'm not subscribed to this list. 
Thanks, Stephen.

That sounds approriate. 
Yes, though if you do use it, the Schema spec says [b] "When a schemaLocation is present, it must contain a single URI reference which the schema author warrants will resolve to a serialization of a ?schema 
document? 
containing the component(s) in the import ed namespace referred to elsewhere in the containing schema document." 
[b] http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#composition-schemaImport 
A non-working hint doesn't seem appropriate to me, why would you use it? 
Yep, the only way it wouldn't is if somehow one interpreted the URL as a secure string/identifier. 
For example, there's some program that will only use schemas that when they import from dsig, import that specific string, and not the URL. 
But I'm not aware of any such processing, and the W3C never indicated "../W3C/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd" is a blessed string/identifier -- unlike other algorithm identifier URIs where we use an absolute URI. 
Thanks Joseph, That's the change we've decided upon. 
Regards, Stephen. 
To debug the RFC editor's processes of course:-)
