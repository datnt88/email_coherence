Hi, I'm planning a talk about Web Accessibility where I will focus mainly on the WAI Priority 1 recommendations. 
I would like to include slides/Web pages that contain the Priority 1 items from the Checklist (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html), including the appropriate copyright info. 
The reason I am writing is that I am also thinking of adding a few of my 
own comments and examples on each slide/Web page as well, and I would guess that this counts as an annotation. 
If I clearly label my annotation as such, and inform you of my plans and when this is on the Web, is that all I need to do? 
(I do agree to the items mentioned about redistribution and possibly rescinding my publication rights.) 
The talk is called "Increasing Web Site Accessibility" and is planned for presentation at the Massachusetts Education Computing Conference, June 13-15, 2001 at UMass Boston. 
I would also like to put the slides/Web pages on the Web some time before that and leave them there after that. 
Probably they would be linked off the training page of my group's site, http://www.umassp.edu/uis/ipg/training.html 
Thanks so much, Carol

Carol, Thank you very the very clear presentation regarding the excerptation and annotation of the W3C document. 
It's fine as is, but should the explanatory text on each page prove to be unwieldy, I think you could also provide the annotation and copyright notices on a slide of it's own, up front, and then the note (*) could be a one-liner link to the more completet slide: "Excerpted from the Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. 
Copyright (c) 1999 W3C (MIT, Inria, Keio). 
Annotations are by Carol Foster and have not received the review or approval of the W3C and WAI."
