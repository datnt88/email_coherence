<s> Hi, I'm planning a talk about Web Accessibility where I will focus mainly on the WAI Priority 1 recommendations.  </s>
<s> I would like to include slides/Web pages that contain the Priority 1 items from the Checklist (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html), including the appropriate copyright info.  </s>
<s> The reason I am writing is that I am also thinking of adding a few of my  </s>
<s> own comments and examples on each slide/Web page as well, and I would guess that this counts as an annotation.  </s>
<s> If I clearly label my annotation as such, and inform you of my plans and when this is on the Web, is that all I need to do?  </s>
<s> (I do agree to the items mentioned about redistribution and possibly rescinding my publication rights.)  </s>
<s> The talk is called "Increasing Web Site Accessibility" and is planned for presentation at the Massachusetts Education Computing Conference, June 13-15, 2001 at UMass Boston.  </s>
<s> I would also like to put the slides/Web pages on the Web some time before that and leave them there after that.  </s>
<s> Probably they would be linked off the training page of my group's site, http://www.umassp.edu/uis/ipg/training.html  </s>
<s> Thanks so much, Carol  </s>

<s> Hi, I am writing to let you know that I have just put my slides/Web pages online at http://www.umassp.edu/uis/ipg/accessibility/  </s>

<s> Carol, Thank you very the very clear presentation regarding the excerptation and annotation of the W3C document.  </s>
<s> It's fine as is, but should the explanatory text on each page prove to be unwieldy, I think you could also provide the annotation and copyright notices on a slide of it's own, up front, and then the note (*) could be a one-liner link to the more completet slide: "Excerpted from the Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.  </s>
