<s> Hello, This is a comment for your DOM Level 3 Core Last Call Working Draft [1].  </s>
<s> Sorry it is over an hour late.  </s>
<s> White space is two words (see all prose and productions in XML 1.0 except one typo in 1998 and the Infoset since WD-xml-infoset-20010202).  </s>
<s> I don't know why it wound up being one word in [element content whitespace].  </s>
<s> Do you?  </s>
<s> isWhitespaceInElementContent [2] could (should?) be  </s>
<s> isWhiteSpaceInElementContent and whitespace-in-element-content [3] could be white-space-in-element-content.  </s>
<s> If Last Call is too late to change those, perhaps at least the prose could match XML and the Infoset to say "white space" (rather than "whitespaces").  </s>
<s> Also I happened to see: s/web/Web/ s/"Universal Resource Identifiers"/"Uniform Resource Identifiers"/ s/[XML Information set]/[XML Information Set]/ In the lists of defined constants, some dd's end in periods when they are sentences but some don't.  </s>
<s> They could all match.  </s>
<s> In Appendix E, does "part of the Level 2 DOM specification" mean Level 3 now?  </s>
<s> ArborText (contents page) became Arbortext (section 1).  </s>
<s> I don't know what year that happened but maybe the Mike Champion affiliation can match.  </s>

<s> Yes, my Infoset comment was that white space is two words "in prose."  </s>
<s> I have been deferring to XML Core and am sending you all a copy of this mail (hope that's all right).  </s>
<s> At the moment white space in XML 1.0 is two words, and in the XML 1.1 Candidate Recommendation it is one word.  </s>
<s> W3C uses Merriam-Webster for its spelling arbiter [1].  </s>
<s> The term comes naturally from margins and other blank areas in book design.  </s>
<s> White makes less sense on computers where background colors can be anything.  </s>
<s> If you and the XML Core Working Group have time to consider this for a minute and you agree that coining "whitespace" is a good idea, please  </s>
<s> let me know and I would be happy to: 1. retract my DOM 3 Core comment [2] 2. and my XML 1.1 CR comment [3] 3. edit to one word in future W3C specs, and 4. change W3C style [4].  </s>

<s> While I'm not trying to complicate matters, I'm afraid there is a larger audience for this issue.  </s>
<s> I think it may be a word in transition from two words to one word (as often happens in the evolution of languages).  </s>
<s> Just a few random examples: The token S in the grammar above stands for whitespace.  </s>
<s> And more ambivalently: 16.6 Whitespace: the 'white-space' property XSL copies CSS in this regard, often using the word "whitespace" but also having properties such as "white-space" and "white-space-collapse" and "white-space-treatment".  </s>
<s> XSL also uses "white space" in prose except when quoting CSS where it is one word.  </s>
<s> * [element content whitespace] A boolean indicating whether the character is white space.  </s>
<s> A scheme-based pointer consists of one or more pointer parts, optionally separated by white space (S).  </s>
<s> XML 1.0 NMTOKENS attribute type, i.e. a whitespace separated list of NMTOKEN's Even though "Am?rique Latine" may exist as a single string outside of the list, when it is included in the list, the whitespace between Am?rique and Latine effectively creates a fourth item Any well-formed XML belonging to any namespace in the (whitespace separated) list; Chapter followed by a single whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.), followed by a single digit On the other hand: However, a string may contain white space, and white space delimits the items in a list type, and the facet is called whiteSpace (presumably the uppercase S implies two words).  </s>
<s> The component/facet is whiteSpace (presumably the uppercase S implies two words).  </s>
<s> and it talks of "the white space normalization rules".  </s>
<s> On the other hand: Under 2.5.1.2 it says "(where whitespace ?match?es S in [XML 1.0 (Second Edition)])".  </s>
<s> and: A ?list? datatype can be ?derived? from an ?atomic? datatype whose ?lexical  </s>
<s> space?  </s>
<s> allows whitespace talks of "Whitespace in Document Content" and: * Retain all whitespace between consecutive start tags and * Normalization of whitespace in start and end tags 9.1 White space ....  </s>
<s> For readability, whitespace may be used in expressions even though not explicitly allowed by the grammar: Although the data model is able to represent comments, processing instructions, and insignificant whitespace,.... paul  </s>
<s> DOM Level 1 used two words (one occurence).  </s>
<s> DOM Level 2 used one and two words (one occurence for each).  </s>
<s> DOM Level 3 is also using both (several occurences for each).  </s>
<s> I don't have a personal opinion on that one.  </s>
<s> As an additional information, googlefight tells us that "white space" wins for the moment.  </s>
<s> I would propose following the Webster in the prose, and the Infoset for methods and attributes naming.  </s>
<s> fixed.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> JAXP and Xerces's seem to exclusively use "Whitespace" instead of "WhiteSpace" (in method definitions) and "whitespace" in prose.  </s>
<s> The .NET frameword defines System.Xml.WhitespaceHandling, System.Xml.XmlWhitespace and System.Xml.XmlSignificantWhitespace but uses "white space" in the prose.  </s>
<s> MSXML defined DOMDocument.preserveWhiteSpace.  </s>
<s> Current usage favors "Whitespace" over "WhiteSpace" in property names but is split on prose.  </s>
<s> [...long discussion of "whitespace" vs. "white space"...] This may not be directly relevant, but taking a quick grep trip ("grep -i '...' */*.tex | wc -l") through the Python documentation shows 114 occurances of "whitespace" and 2 for "white space".  </s>
<s> Part of the general shift toward "whitespace" may be a matter of using the term to mean "characters that represent what might be presented as white space" rather than to the white space on a page.  </s>
<s> It's easy to think of "white space" when something is conceptually mapped to a sheet of paper, but harder when it's not intended for any presentation to a human: spaces/tabs/newlines are very important in HTTP headers, but there's not normally any presentation of that data, so there isn't any "white space", but programmers still think of them as "whitespace" characters that are useful in separating tokens.  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Zope Corporation  </s>
<s> The name of the method isWhitespaceInElementContent has been changed to isElementContentWhitespace to better reflect that it refers to the Infoset property "element-content-whitespace".  </s>
<s> Same kind of change has been applied to the "whitespace-in-element-content" parameter.  </s>
<s> Since it is too late to rename the Infoset property, and our method and parameter are mapped to it, we don't plan to rename them, whatever the outcome of the whitespace vs white space is.  </s>
<s> Regarding the prose itself, we will happily change to whatever becomes the recommendation, and thus at any stage.  </s>
