Does anyone have an excellent source of annotation use cases in the real world? 
Thanks, Steven Steven Livingstone I have a handful of use cases - are you looking for that, or for soething that gnerates a use case when you ress a button? 
(Actually you have to prod me into writing mine if you need to see them - otherwise they tend to come out slowly...) cheers Chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France The use cases themselves would be great! 
Wouldn't mind that button either right enough, but the use cases themselves would be great for now. 
Cheers, Steven.
