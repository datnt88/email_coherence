Fulfilling Jutta's action item from teh previous meeting... Yes, we could base our techniques on WCAG 2. But that would not be directly helpful to people trying to conform to ATAG since the ATAG 1.0 explicitly requires conformance to WCAG 1.0 We received the checkpoint mapping for the draft from WCAG (see mesage from me titled "Checkpoint Mapping beteween WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0" at details) so we could fairly mechanically change the techniques that are assigned to a current WCAG checkpoint. 
But I think we might as well hold off until WCAG 2 is around last call, since otherwise we will end up trying to maintain two version of the document, and have to reorder every time WCAG changes their draft.

I did bring this up at the CG meeting last week and the general consensus was as Charles discussed it. 
If we can put the stuff into the structure to easily transform the document when the time comes (ie, when WCAG2 has matured), that would address both concerns raised.

Absotively and posolutely. 
However, if we start anything like ATAG 2 then... Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
