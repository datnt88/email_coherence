Done! (I've removed Henry For, which I guess makes sense.) 
I don't understand the bit in parentheses... Gudge 
nsdecl 
The exact as it was before the change had some surrouding XML elements that were not defined in the Schema, and you have ommitted these. 
I thought it made sense, since the Schema was not defining them anyway. 
From memory: the sourroudning XML was something like tag Henry Ford /tag Jean-jacques.
