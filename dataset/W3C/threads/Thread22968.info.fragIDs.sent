<s> A few thoughts:  </s>
<s> I'd say that's a binding issue -- "what does null mean in this binding" --  </s>
<s> since the main spec is supposed to be language independent and many languages do not permit optional/implied arguments or method overloading.  </s>
<s> There's a consistancy question.  </s>
<s> If we declare that undefined shall be taken as null here, we should probably do so throughout the API.  </s>
<s> Purely personal reaction: it strikes me as a bit late to be making that sort of large-scale change in the bindings.  </s>
<s> I admit it's likely to be backward-compatable, because nobody should have been issuing the truncated form of these calls... but forcing every implementation to update itself in order to support what is, at most, a minor coding convenience seems hard to justify.  </s>
<s> So I'd tend to put this one in the category of "Might have been nice if we'd thought of it, but we missed our opportunity."  </s>
<s> Of course I'm not an ECMAScript developer, so my opinion isn't highly significant and I'm perfectly willing to be outvoted on this one.  </s>

<s> Just to refresh on the back ground for those who tuned in.  </s>
<s> The impetus for the initial question was that the NIST tests had code like: boolean hasFeature = impl.hasFeature("XML","");  </s>
<s> but didn't test: boolean hasFeature = impl.hasFeature("XML",null);  </s>
<s> I can't justify that the first as a valid test based on the original text, "" isn't unspecified, it is an empty string.  </s>
<s> I think that the majority of Java developers would look at the second form and the spec and say it should return true if the processor supports any version of XML.  </s>
<s> However, I believe at least one processor threw an exception when passed a null.  </s>
<s> If the NIST test form and only the NIST test form is correct, then "unspecified" should be "empty string" MSXML 3.0's documentation for IXMLDOMImplement.hasFeature ( m/xmmthhasfeature.asp) and System.Xml.XmlImplementation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html /frlrfsystemxmlxmlimplementationclasshasfeaturetopic.asp) interpreted unspecified == null  </s>

<s> in any version.  </s>
<s> In Level 1, "1.0" is the only valid version value.  </s>
<s> I think an errata is necessary because different people have looked at that statement and come up with different interpretations.  </s>
<s> So the options are: 1. Change "unspecified" to "empty string".  </s>
<s> The NIST test stands, and the behavior using null is unspecified.  </s>
<s> 2. Change "unspecified" to "null".  </s>
<s> Behavior using empty string is unspecified.  </s>
<s> 3. Change "unspecified" to "null or empty string".  </s>
<s> The NIST test stands (but an additional test should be added) and the behavior using null is specified.  </s>
<s> 4. Change "unspecified" to "undefined, null or empty string" or "undefined or null" This would definitely be the most desireable from a usage standpoint and might possibly reflect the behavior of deployed ECMAScript implementations.  </s>
<s> I will try to check the MSXML behavior when I finally get to the office.  </s>
<s> If someone could quickly check Netscape 6/Mozilla, I'd be grateful.  </s>
<s> Basically, you would want to results of: impl.hasFeature("XML","1.0"); impl.hasFeature("XML",""); impl.hasFeature("XML",null); impl.hasFeature("XML",undefined); impl.hasFeature("XML");  </s>
<s> If both browsers return true for all the cases, or for all the cases except "", then I'd change it to "undefined, null, or empty string".  </s>
<s> If Microsoft fails the last two, then "undefined" would not be acceptible.  </s>
<s> The hasFeature method is defined as a BSTR which doesn't have a distinct value for "undefined".  </s>
<s> JScript will either coerce undefined to a null BSTR or throws an exception before it invokes the implementation.  </s>
<s> If it throws an exception on the coercsion, then it would require a change of their version parameter to a VARIANT to prevent to coercsion and that would be unacceptibly distruptive.  </s>
<s> I'll try to get the results for at least the MSXML tests within the hour.  </s>
