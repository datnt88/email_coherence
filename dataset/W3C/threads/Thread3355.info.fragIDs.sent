<s> So, would anyone out there like to share their test and their experiences of writing them?  </s>

<s> Libby, A possible additional [FA]Q?: Can I enumerate the contents of a container using a query?  </s>

<s> (The current version of my query code supports both.  </s>

<s> The test cases for the RDQL in Jena are shipped with the standard Jena distribution - you can pull them out of the CVS repository on SourceForge as well.  </s>
<s> The control (manifest) file is not RDF - but it could be.  </s>
<s> Tests take the  </s>

<s> I don't test failure cases (i.e. that queries that are wrong fail in the expectedly wrong way).  </s>

<s> same here - we got some simple RDQL regression tests distributed with rdfstore and you can have a look to them on the CVS rep at sourceforge.  </s>
<s> we are not going that far at the moment just having some test data, queries and some expected num of results; everything is in perl code at the moment but it would be great to have some good ones expressed in some RDF, like Libby/Dan ones and jena.  </s>
<s> I was proposing to Libby eventually the possibility to add links on that page to actually add test data to specific use-cases or examples together with some test results i.e. link up the tests to the query language example to the use-cases.  </s>
<s> is there an RDF Schema for Libby's tests-manifest somewhere?  </s>
<s> not that I need one at the moment :-) cheers Alberto  </s>
<s> Hi Libby! good question; it seems to us that a query is simply a set of triples where bnodes play the role of variables we then basically can apply a resolution process The resolution process starts with a query.  </s>
<s> A query is a tripleset.  </s>
<s> The query will be matched against the triplesets of the initial graph G and against the rules.  </s>
<s> The set unifies with a rule when one of the triples of the set unifies with the consequent of the rule.  </s>
<s> The set unifies with another set if all triples in the set unify with a triple of the other set.  </s>
<s> This can possibly be done in different ways.  </s>
<s> The result of the unification of two triple sets is a list of substitutionlists.  </s>
<s> and this is work done by Guido Naudts in his master thesis we also have some running code at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/ and some testcases starting at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/etc5 but there's still a lot to do... Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
