It seems to me that Betsie can't handle tildes? 
In the USA, this is a fairly common construct. 
Try http://www.gwu.edu/~chaos or http://www.jagunet.com/~rtsmrc 
Betsie also could not handle a page that is currently giving Lynx fits at

Subject: Re: New(ish) Test Version Of Betsie Date: Sunday, May 30, 1999 5:00 PM To help us test the Wayne's new(ish) version of Betsie, I've mirrored it 
at 
our web site: with the following changes: 1. Added form-type user interface 2. Removed limitation to BBC sites (the "safe list"). 
So you can enter 
any

Hi, I'm currently working on an improved version of Betsie, with all kinds 
of 
new features and some currently highly dodgy implementations of them. 
All 
criticisms / suggestions / pointings out of shortcomings / whatever will 
be 
gratefully received; I am hoping to have the new version ready to roll fairly shortly, but it needs to be better than it currently is. 
You can test the new version here: and I'd be particularly into hearing what people think the best way to ensure that everyone can customise it as easily as possible would be, as well as if there are any more really simple and stupid bugs that I've missed, or other simple one liners along the lines of: s/click here/select this link/gis; that might substantially improve things.

Thanks bruce for observing that 
I took a look with lynx. 
This page has two frames, one of which is actually blank, to wit (or witless) 
So we could add a repair rule: omit blank frames And as special case, if there's just one frame, release it from it's shell. 
Actually, I think WAG in effect did this by concatenating frames into a single page.... I'll have to take a look... gotta run now... There's also some images with no alt text. 
Otherwise reads OK. Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Universal Design Engineer, Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Adjunct Professor, Electrical Engineering Temple University Ritter Hall Annex, Room 423, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org

Actually the problem was latter on. 
I should have explained this better. 
I explored both frames, and found the one with content. 
This was no big deal. 
But then try going further. 
Follow the link for "_create_ new student account". 
Filling-in the few lines is no problem (Lynx or Betsie) but submitting the form is another story. 
Lynx cannot activate the "Create" button (even though [BUTTON] is displayed). 
Betsie shows the button, but when it is selected just generates a blank page. 
Please try this, you will not get to a validation screen until after this step (use whatever text you want for the fields). 
I think the pages use poorly designed Java script. 
As you saw, nominally IE 4+ is required. 
For the source of one page was a subroutine named "IE3 stinks" -- this can't be too professional work! 
Thank you for your efforts.
