<s> You can test the new version here: and I'd be particularly into hearing what people think the best way to ensure that everyone can customise it as easily as possible would be, as well as if there are any more really simple and stupid bugs that I've missed, or other simple one liners along the lines of: s/click here/select this link/gis; that might substantially improve things.  </s>

<s> Actually the problem was latter on.  </s>
<s> I should have explained this better.  </s>
<s> I explored both frames, and found the one with content.  </s>
<s> This was no big deal.  </s>
<s> But then try going further.  </s>
<s> Follow the link for "_create_ new student account".  </s>
<s> Filling-in the few lines is no problem (Lynx or Betsie) but submitting the form is another story.  </s>
<s> Lynx cannot activate the "Create" button (even though [BUTTON] is displayed).  </s>
<s> Betsie shows the button, but when it is selected just generates a blank page.  </s>
<s> Please try this, you will not get to a validation screen until after this step (use whatever text you want for the fields).  </s>
<s> I think the pages use poorly designed Java script.  </s>
<s> As you saw, nominally IE 4+ is required.  </s>
<s> For the source of one page was a subroutine named "IE3 stinks" -- this can't be too professional work!  </s>
