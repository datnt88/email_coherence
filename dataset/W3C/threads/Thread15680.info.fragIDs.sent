<s> Thanks, Jamal ----- Forwarded Message Follows ----- Date: Fri, 10 Jul 1998 13:59:21 -0700 From: "Luther Smith" SMITHLL@dshs.wa.gov Subject: Internet Search Engine Jamal, I presently work at Washington Department of Social &amp; Health Services/Aging &amp; Adult Services Administration (AASA), and I am managing the development of our initial Internet site.  </s>
<s> Our site will be hosted by the Washington Department of Information Services (DIS), where most other Washington state agency sites are located.  </s>
<s> We are interested in having the most highly-accessible site possible.  </s>
<s> DIS is planning to acquire an "industrial-strength" search engine for their site, which will be the single search engine for all their hosted sites.  </s>
<s> They currently favor the Netscape Compass search engine and will begin a 90-day evaluation July 27.  </s>
<s> Our experiments with that search engine using the Lynx browser yield miserable results.  </s>
<s> The search engine apparently requires a Javascript browser, which causes a Lynx browser user to go down a long and frustrating path to yield the same results as are easily available to an Internet Explorer or Netscape browser user (try using the search function at DSHS.WA.GOV for a demo).  </s>
<s> In our preliminary discussions with DIS personnel, each of the other major search engines failed to meet one or more of DIS's informal requirements: 1. Detect and use META tags (Excite doesn't); 2. Middle-of-the-road pricing ($12,000 for Netscape Compass vs. $30,000 for Alta Vista); 3. Search engine vendor is responsive and flexible to work with.  </s>
<s> 4. Requires no customized coding to implement.  </s>
<s> What is your personal preference for the search engine we need ?  </s>
<s> We are working regularly with Washington Assistive Technology Alliance in building our site.  </s>
<s> I will forward the same question to Deb Cook.  </s>
<s> Are there other resources we should work with ?  </s>
<s> I am very hopeful that we can find a mutually satisfactory search engine through these informal, low-level negotiations.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your consideration.  </s>
<s> Look at Verity (Search97?). this server package is becoming more popular and easy to use.  </s>
<s> Also check out not sure what verity costs...but when you are making your decision, you must include training (and availability) and maintenance costs, and technical support.  </s>
<s> Make sure you know what you are paying to have on and off site.  </s>
<s> Some companies may have lower costs, but poor training, technical support and availability!  </s>
<s> Do your homework.  </s>
<s> Make sure the package is in-line with your current network/os enterprise solution.  </s>

<s> well: this should be a good hammer to go hit the search vendors with.  </s>
<s> The gratuitous use of Javascript is really irritating, and in general I've avoided Netscape's server products because the configuration step is so inaccessible --in addition to the products themselves being inconsiderate of someone who is blind.  </s>
<s> My personal favorite search engine is Altavista.  </s>
<s> The engine is powerful, and it is easy to customize and configure its look and feel.  </s>
<s> And it delivers powerful searching without doing a javascript song and dance on your screen.  </s>
