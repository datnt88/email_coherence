Dear All, Have uploaded Chuck's new version of the Auxillary Benefits appendix - see: As Chuck indicated that he probably won't be available for a week or two, I 
am happy to collate comments and amend the latest draft appropriately. 
Cheers, Andrew 
From the "Improve usability for non-disabled visitors" section of "...Text alternatives" I would broaden this bullet (or bite it?) to encompass the notion that "text is not sacred" and that having something akin to illustrative alternatives to text is of benefit to the millions with mild to severe learning disorders and the "partially literate". 
We so unthinkingly accept the idea of text being "first among equals" within the communications media because practically everybody working on these documents is in a rather advanced state of denial about text's universality. 
Just a brief mention of how many more people are reached by illustrations than pure text? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
From the "Improve Search Engine listings and Resource Discovery" section In the Text Alternatives there might be benefit in mentioning a side benefit of having table summaries because they could show up in a search that missed the tables because their headers and contents didn't contain the notion for which a search is being made. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
William, The usefulness of illustration with text deserves more than a mere mention, but that is a good start.
