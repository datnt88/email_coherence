per [76]25 May teleconf ([77] issue 504). 
* 11.4: Single-key mode sufficient, per [78]25 May teleconf ([79] issue 505). 
Conformance * New section on configuration issues. 
Glossary * "Global configuration". 
Clarified per [80]30 May teleconf. 
* "User agent user interface": Clarified. 
* "Empty content": New * "Explicit user request": About UA UA controls only. 
* "Rendered text": Added. 
Per [81]25 May teleconf ([82] issue 507). 
References * Added statement to informative refrences section that some may become normative if used to satisfy G6 and G8, per [83]24 May teleconf Techniques * 1.1: Added rationale why cognitive burden of too much direct key access. 
* 4.3: Added technique for case of SMIL regions (and non-applicability of foreground color). 
Per [84]25 May teleconf ([85] issue 507).

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 In the new "distributed" UAAG 1.0, the first link on each page is "next", which takes you to the next chapter. 
It is followed by "contents", which takes you to the main table of contents.

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 aloha, ian! one of the problems with the new "distributed" UAAG 1.0 is that it is impossible to ascertain the date of the document one is reading from within a sub-section, unless that sub-section happens to be cover.html this is a really annoying aspect of the chopping up of technical recommendations into bite-sized morsels... why isn't there a W3C Process guarding against this? if date-stamps are important enough to embed in URIs, surely they should be repeated somewhere in a document which "may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time" gregory. 
ABSURDITY, n. 
A statement or belief manifestly inconsistent with one's own opinion.

Camera Obscura: http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/index.html thanks, it's handy I guess but perhaps next chapter or something a bit more descriptive for those of us who are dense migh be better? 
I never know what next means when I am tabbing. 
In the new "distributed" UAAG 1.0, the first link on each page is "next", which takes you to the next chapter. 
It is followed by "contents", which takes you to the main table of contents.

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 I can repeat the status and date information at the top of each chapter. 
I would note that the more metadata we duplicate the more burdensome it will become to read the document. 
However, date and status label (e.g., Working Draft) seems reasonable.
