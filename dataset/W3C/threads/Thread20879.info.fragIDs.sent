<s> Dear Amaya Team, I am having problems with cutting and pasting in the Open (URI) field on Amaya.  </s>
<s> For example, doing a ctrl-C in the field pastes some old, copied string into the field, instead of copying the new one.  </s>
<s> Other times, it seems that doing a ctrl-C delects the first character in the string.  </s>
<s> There are other, related symptoms as well.  </s>
<s> I am using Amaya 7.0 on Windows 2000.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve  </s>

<s> Yes, for me too.  </s>
<s> And is bizarre because the copy and paste works with the mouse but not with ctrl+c and ctrl+v Best regards, Emmanuelle  </s>
