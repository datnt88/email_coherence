Dear Amaya Team, I am having problems with cutting and pasting in the Open (URI) field on Amaya. 
For example, doing a ctrl-C in the field pastes some old, copied string into the field, instead of copying the new one. 
Other times, it seems that doing a ctrl-C delects the first character in the string. 
There are other, related symptoms as well. 
I am using Amaya 7.0 on Windows 2000. 
Thanks, Steve

Yes, for me too. 
And is bizarre because the copy and paste works with the mouse but not with ctrl+c and ctrl+v Best regards, Emmanuelle

This problem is now fixed in the CVS base. 
We plan to publish a release 7.1 this week. 
This release will include a set of recent bug fixes.
