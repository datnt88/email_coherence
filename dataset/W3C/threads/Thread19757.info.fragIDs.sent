Using the Oct 24 version of Amaya 1.1b on a Win95, pentium 133, with 32 meg, dial-up connection, true color 24 bit, I have observed the following critters: The stop button doesn't appear to function. 
The rendering of graphics to text using a stylesheet (I assume) is not correct. 
Visit http://www.w3.org/style/ as an example. 
Scroll bar is unstable when dragging it with the mouse. 
Clicking between the bar and end points seems to work ok. 
Web documents do not appear to be cached when using the back button. 
Since it refuses to load local documents, I have not taken the time to check it our further. 
Keep up the great work, though!

We've troubles with the event loop on Windows platform and we don't manage different buttons state. 
You know that this release is an Alpha release and we're still working on it. 
The stylesheet implementation is not complete neither in Unix nor in Windows versions. 
In particular, positioning properties used in this css page are not implemented. 
Yes but it's not easy to understand why. 
The Windows API is not always clear and complete. 
You're right. 
I'm sure, it shouldn't. 
I've not problem to open a local file. 
How do you do that: using the open menu or using the address field ? 
Irene. 
Using the file  open  technique, Amaya doesn't appear to allow spaces in a local directory name. 
Win95 does allow this.

That's not the only problem. 
Amaya also cannot handle relative addresses and is always looking for files in the root directory: In the document c:\test\index.html there is a link to a file in the same directory: A HREF="file1.html" file1 /A . 
Amaya is not looking for c:\test\file1.html, but for c:\file1.html 
and therefore cannot find the file. 
Maybe this is also the reason why Amaya doesn't display images (when I place an image in the root, it is displayed correct).
