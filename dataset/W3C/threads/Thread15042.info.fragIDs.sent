<s> Hi, If i may follow up on my question about data and layout tables.  </s>
<s> Thank you everybody who allready sent me answers about definitions.  </s>
<s> Could you comment on the following examples:  </s>
<s> Question: are the examples that follow data or layout tables (supposing that table markup has been used)?  </s>
<s> 1. What about a table that is used to layout the following columns for a list of about 150 people: Name, telephone number, building number, floor, internal code 2. A table that is used to layout a train timetable into three columns for the trains from Amsterdam to Utrecht: departure, arrival, sort of train 3. A table that is used for the following 'data' (sorry, i used spaces in this mail to fake columns): Name, Telephone number Eric +31 12 3456789 Peter +31 12 3456789 Mary +31 12 3456789 John +31 12 3456789 etc. 4. Number of companies that correlate with the results: Company correlation Philips 0,06 Johnson 0,09 Nokia 0,4 Ericsson 0,29 etc. Kindest regards, Eric Velleman  </s>
<s> All these tables have significant, regular data structure conveyed by the layout.  </s>
<s> These are _all_ 'data' tables in the colloquial parlance.  </s>
<s> In each case there is a special relationship between the content of one cell and the content of another cell in the same row.  </s>
<s> These relationships are connoted by this geometrical alignment; and the nature of the relationship is repeated row after row.  </s>
<s> In the cases where you gave headers, the nature of the repeating relationship is explained in the pattern of headers.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Al's right: they're all data tables.  </s>
<s> By contrast, the main table(s) at they simply ensure the placement of elements on the screen in accordance with a visual design: their purpose is aesthetic, not informative.  </s>

<s> Yes, I also think they're all data table.  </s>
<s> The visual layout is not essential to the meaning: it's only a way to represent the relationship among datas.  </s>
<s> The same relations could be expressed in another way, as the heders html method that could be spoken by screen readers.  </s>

<s> (supposing that table markup has been used)?  </s>
<s> This is a little contribution to point out the difference between data and layout tables.  </s>
<s> A data table is a table in which you can't alter the position of a cell in a column or in a row without altering data consistency.  </s>
<s> For example, if you have a two column table in which the first column contains people's names and the second column contains their telephone numbers, you can't move the content of a cell up or down in the second column without destroying the relationship between at least two names and two numbers.  </s>
<s> The same rule applies to data headers: in the foregoing example I can't invert "names" header with "telephone numbers" header at the top of the table without destroying consistency between headers and data in the table.  </s>
<s> On the contrary, a layout table is a table in which you *can* modify the position of a cell in a column or in a row without altering data consistency.  </s>
<s> Doing so, you only alter the appearance of the page.  </s>
<s> For example, if you have a three column/one row layout table, in which the first column contains the site menu, the second column contains a list of abstracts from the last articles published on the site and the third column contains some links to other sites, you can freely invert the position of the three cells without altering data consistency: the list of abstracts will remain meaningful wether you put it on the left, on the center or on the right.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you may summarize this difference saying that a layout table is a table in which you can't use properly CAPTION and TH elements.  </s>
<s> All the best, Michele Diodati  </s>
