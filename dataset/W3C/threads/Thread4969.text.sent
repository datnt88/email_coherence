(IBM-XQ-027): Responding to a request for clarification, I propose that the following rules be added to the XQuery specification: (a) A static error is raised if a prolog contains multiple declarations for the default element/type namespace or multiple declarations for the default function namespace (including declarations imported from other modules). 
These conditions are already defined to be errors in Appendix C, but they need clarifying text and error codes. 
(b) A static error is raised if a direct or computed element constructor contains multiple specifications of the default element/type namespace (that is, multiple namespace declaration attributes named xmlns, or multiple local namespace declarations with no prefix). 
We need an error code for this. 
(c) A static error is raised if a namespace declaration attribute (in a direct element constructor) or a local namespace declaration (in a computed element constructor) binds a namespace prefix to a zero-length URI. 
There is already an error (XQ0053) that covers this case if it occurs in a prolog; this error can be extended to cover the additional cases. 
(d) A static error is raised if two namespace declaration attributes within the same direct element constructor bind the same namespace prefix. 
There is already an error (XQ0043) that covers this case for local namespace declarations in a computed element constructor; this error can be extended to cover the additional case. 
(e) The section on attributes in direct element constructors says "All the attribute nodes generated by an element constructor must have unique names". 
We should specify that error XQ0025 is raised if this rule is violated. 
Currently XQ0025 seems to cover only duplicate attribute names that occur in the content sequence. 
--Don Chamberlin Concerning the phrase in parentheses in (a), surely namespace declarations are never imported from another module?

--Don Chamberlin Hi Michael, Of course you are right (I'm embarrassed). 
Thanks for pointing this out. 
Still, assigning an error code to conflicting default namespace declarations in the same prolog would be helpful.
