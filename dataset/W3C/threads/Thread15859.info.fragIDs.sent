<s> For a very long time now, and across a wide range of browsers, it seems to have been the case that if there is no more than one "INPUT TYPE=TEXT" field, then hitting Enter (return) will cause the form to be submitted, whereas if there is more than one such field, submission can only be done by using the Submit button/widget.  </s>
<s> I had a rather long-standing page on this topic: and that behaviour seemed eminently reasonable, in as much as it facilitates the submission of simple forms, while limiting the risk, when the form is more complex, of a partially-completed form being submitted by accident, bearing in mind that a user is quite likely to hit "enter" when inputting some text to a field.  </s>
<s> However, it's just been called to my attention that what I say there is untrue of MSIE4, although it was true of, at least, Windows MSIE3.  </s>
<s> After some tests of Windows MSIE4, I have had to conclude that hitting Enter within an INPUT TYPE=TEXT will _always_ submit the form, even when the form has several INPUT TYPE=TEXT areas and/or several SUBMIT buttons; I found nothing that I could do in HTML alone that would prevent it.  </s>
<s> To me, this seems to be an accessibility issue, even if there's nothing that I can find in the HTML4.0 specification to say that this behaviour is wrong.  </s>
<s> I've done some searches on likely terms, and found several previous discussions in various forums, which confirmed that MSIE4 behaves in the way I just described; none of them seemed to indicate any way to inhibit this behaviour.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know more about this issue or can point me to some relevant discussions or resource about it?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Hi, The possibility of submitting a form by pressing enter even though the focus is not on the submit button, is very important.  </s>
<s> By behaving this way IE4 saves keyboard users a lot of keystrokes in big forms lets say with 8 controls.  </s>
<s> The first control is the important edit field and the following 6 controls are of less importance.  </s>
<s> Because IE let's you submit the form when the first field is filled in you as a keyboard user does not have to use the tab key 6 times to get to the submit button.  </s>
<s> The only other way to accomplish this is to use accesskeys in forms, and then the user has to know wich keys are assigned to the controls.  </s>

<s> in the previous message on this topic, it was rightly stated that some confusion could and does indeed arrise when the enter key is mistakenly pressed prematurely.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a setting and or a hot key to take one to the submit button automatically is in order here.  </s>
<s> the setting would allow you to toggle the effect of the enter key on forms.  </s>

<s> Thanks very much for this analysis.  </s>
<s> To me, it seemed to be random as to when the enter key acted as the submit button.  </s>
<s> I don't know if I agree with Claus as to the utility of this "feature".  </s>
<s> I would think that consistent behavior is more desirable than situation dependent shortcuts, especially when one can't count "INPUT TYPE=TEXT" without looking at source code (and some author will put two or more short forms right after each other, making it look like one long form), especially with a screen-reader (since "big" and "small" forms will sound the same initially, and "big" is defined by the number of text fields -- not the number of fields, and not the length of the form)!  </s>
<s> Does anyone have similar tips for navigating pop-up lists?  </s>

<s> One approach which might work equally well for the mouse-free and eyes-free modes of use would be if there were standard "review" and "submit" methods for FORMs.  </s>
<s> Review would get you a compact presentation of all the current field values that would be submitted should you submit, and place the focus on a submit element [or equivalently, arm the "submit" command, if it is not always available in a FORM.] Submit would also be a browser verb, equivalent to a macro which does the hotkey for the submit element and then activates the submit.  </s>
<s> This is applying hierarchy to online transaction processing.  </s>
<s> It is something like the story about how DIV is a better structuring device than Hn.  </s>
<s> There are more consumers who are tripped up by forms than just eyes-free consumers.  </s>
<s> Some set of operations that work on the FORM structure as a unit, and include "review" might be able to reduce customer complaint levels across the board, and build consumer trust in electronic commerce.  </s>
<s> It is certainly the way responsible telephone order takers work.  </s>

<s> This is just like a regular Windows dialog, where pressing Enter on a control that does not use Enter (like a radio button, check box, single-line edit control) activates the default button, usually the Ok button.  </s>

<s> I am afraid there are UI consistency problems between "standard Windows Dialog conventions" and web forms.  </s>
<s> In Windows (and Mac), the default action/button is made clear to the user by a dark, thick button border.  </s>
<s> In web forms, the default is the submit.  </s>
<s> From a UI consistency point of view, this should be addressed.  </s>
<s> In a self-voicing browser like ours, we can optionally announce the fact that the submit button is the default.  </s>
<s> Is it important or desirable to add an attribute to the button to indicate which is Default?  </s>
<s> This allows something other than the Submit to be the default, and allows the UA to decide how to render it.  </s>
<s> Accesskeys (keyboard short-cuts) exhibit another problem.  </s>
<s> In windows dialogs, the accesskey is shown in dialog labels and buttons as an underscore, and in dialog editors, the accesskey is defined in context using the &amp; character (example: &amp;Send E&amp;xit).  </s>
<s> This is not possible in HTML and requires some extra work to get the same visible effect.  </s>
<s> This makes me wonder about the design of the accesskey attribute, and whether there is not a better solution.  </s>
<s> And in our browser we have the problem of the potential conflict between browser built-in shortcut keys and those defined on the form.  </s>
<s> We allow complete user keyboard re-mapping of all browser functions and face the question, which takes precedence?  </s>
<s> IE appears to give precedence to the form's accesskey, which has the side effect of disabling previously accessible browser functions.  </s>
<s> Is this desirable for the user?  </s>
<s> We don't think so, and at this point we are not going to enable accesskey support in our code.  </s>
