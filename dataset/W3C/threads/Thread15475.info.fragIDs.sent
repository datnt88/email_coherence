<s> SCOPE needs to be added to both TH and TD, since TD elements can act as row headers.  </s>
<s> This should not be a problem, since if I recall correctly, TH and TD share the same element and attribute definitions in the DTD.  </s>
<s> Indeed the scope attribute is valid on both and allows one to treat some TD cells as acting as kind of like headers.  </s>

<s> /EM Although the first cell in the row is treated visually as a data cell, it is marked up with scope=row so that an aural browser can "explain" later cells in the same row in terms of the cell that gives the course name.  </s>

<s> 1. Do we want SCOPE on TD? In the context of the current draft, yes.  </s>
<s> Given that we have only the AXES attribute to connect a table cell to other cells to form a "keep-with" constraint, I believe that in practical terms we do want SCOPE on TD as well as TH.  </s>
<s> There will be table cells holding data values in the list of AXES IDs along with cells holding data descriptions.  </s>
<s> At that point it does not make sense to start a crusade about when to call something a TD versus a TH.  </s>
<s> I had been stingy with the SCOPE attribute because at the moment I did that I was under the influence of the hope that if an author cares enough to put SCOPE marking on a cell, they might be willing to use a TH cell for headers.  </s>
<s> But I realize that one wants to indicate SCOPE for cells that I would call key values and you would call de-facto headers.  </s>
<s> 2. Al thought of this as ... Yes, Al tried to explain this via inputs and outputs, in which case the key data are all the inputs and the self data is one among possibly several outputs.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it may be clearer to say it this way: AXES ties a cell to other cells that you want to keep with the current cell in non-visual cell query, baloon help, or whatever.  </s>
<s> These other cells comprise a rough definition of the logical vicinity of the current cell.  </s>
<s> I wanted to subdivide these links to logically-close cells into CONDS links that tell you "when" about the current cell and TYPE links that tell you "what" about the current cell.  </s>
<s> The AXES attribute definition as it stands lumps all these relationships as "what."  </s>
<s> You can do that because "what" is a very permissive category under which you can classify anything you have no better home for.  </s>
<s> I still believe that for general utility of the semantic markup there should be at least two classes of semantic links among table cells and that when/what is the most obviously useful dichotomy.  </s>
<s> That is because the semantics where you really need tables is when the message involves significant second-order relationships.  </s>
<s> Analogies of the form "Beer is to television as popcorn is to movies and hot-dogs to baseball." and statements such as "Joe is more distant in age from his closest sibling than Mary is from hers." are second-order relationships.  </s>
<s> They show up in tables as an H pattern overlaid on the table.  </s>
<s> Each arm of the H is terminated by some local cluster or pod of cells which form an atom for they purposes of the H (like a short stack of descriptors cascaded to form a composite description of the data in the row or column subject to this description).  </s>
<s> It may be a single cell, as is common in the case of a TD in the body of the table.  </s>
<s> One of the key capabilities of tables which is why we don't just use indented table-of-contents lists all the time is the capability to compactly communicate lots of second-order relationships; via the parallelism between a pair of pod-pairs, i.e. the visual H. To keep the H's straight, it is desirable to view the cells on a two-dimensional semantic grid.  </s>
<s> By lumping key data and data descriptors under one class of links, valuable information has been lost.  </s>
<s> You have collapsed the H into a star topology with me at the center and keep-with-me ringed around.  </s>
<s> The shape of the relationship has been lost.  </s>

<s> T.V., In this quote I am appealing to the Newton desktop use of the journalist's agenda, who/what/when/etc.  </s>
<s> Is there anything comparable in your model of the audio desktop as the top-level categories for sorting links to related information?  </s>
<s> I haven't read your book, but I would imagine that an audio desktop would want to deal in reasonably small sound-bites, and keep a cache of bites handy which are closely linked to what is happening (the current event) in the audio.  </s>
<s> An "out of earshot model" would hold their connections to the current event.  </s>
<s> Does this relate?  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> Al, I have just re-read your status report and appreciate it very much.  </s>
<s> The report makes it clear how far we have progressed, and which issues remain to be resolved.  </s>
<s> One aspect that could be corrected: SCOPE needs to be added to both TH and TD, since TD elements can act as row headers.  </s>
<s> This should not be a problem, since if I recall correctly, TH and TD share the same element and attribute definitions in the DTD.  </s>
<s> Also, your discussion of searching for map areas within OBJECT is ambiguous.  </s>
<s> The basic functionality requirement is that (1) if SHAPES is specified, a visual user agent (with graphics enabled) will search for anchors with COORDS attributes, specified in the content of OBJECT, which will define the areas of the image map.  </s>
<s> In all other circumstances, visual user agents (with graphics enabled) should ignore the content of object.  </s>
<s> (2) Non-visual user agents, (or visual user agents with graphics disabled) always render the content of OBJECT.  </s>
<s> Note that these rules are implicit in the September draft, and may have been clarified in the October draft, which I have not had time to read.  </s>
<s> I regret having to disagree with you in respect of the table issues.  </s>
<s> Regards, Jason.  </s>
