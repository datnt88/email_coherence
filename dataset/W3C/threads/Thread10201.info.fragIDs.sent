<s> Concerning the WebOnt issue regarding "Structured Datatypes" atatypes, it looks like WebOnt is running out of time to be able to create a "deep" understanding of XML datatypes.  </s>
<s> I am wondering if a clarification of RDF datatypes might provide us an interim solution.  </s>
<s> The current RDF datatypes proposal seems to consider so-called "simple" XML Schema datatypes e.g. might this also work for "XML" datatypes i.e. fragments of XML that are valid with respect to a "complex" XML Schema datatype e.g. where &amp;foo;bar identifies an XML Schema particule analogous to the XML datatype !ELEMENT this (#PCDATA) If this is already allowed, I will propose that WebOnt close our issue and if its not something currently allowed, do RDF Core folk consider this useful?  </s>

<s> This would need to include the parseType specification, but yes, I have considered this both intuitive and reasonable for quite some time, and I understand that the present datatyping solution either already supports this, or has the pieces in place to do so with minor tweaks.  </s>

<s> Did typed XML literals actually make it into the RDF/XML and graph syntax?  </s>

<s> No, we don't.  </s>
<s> In particular parseType literal is not what I'd like to encourage using as an extension mechanism, especially for datatypes!  </s>
<s> We used to think of the parseType="Literal" as setting an is_XML flag on the literal to be true, now we think of it as a datatyped literal where the URI of the datatype is rdfs:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the XML Schema WG has an issue to provide URIs for their more complex datatypes ("particles"?) but hasn't yet addressed it.  </s>
<s> I just remember hearing this, I may be wrong.  </s>
<s> So if that happens, then it'll be Dave  </s>
<s> Patrick Stickler said:  </s>
<s> Well, formerly XML literals were special, they set an is_XML flag on the literals, hence "foo" compared to xml"foo" Now, the latter is considered part of the datatype structure and hence the is_XML flag is subsumed by the datatype URI rdfs:XMLLiteral i.e. "typed XML literals" are gone.  </s>
<s> hence my recent question about killing the syntax xml"foo" form: which I'm moving to doing unless I get some real problems with it.  </s>
