<s> As the file you want to embed with the object element is a MathML expression, you must use the corresponding MIME type as defined in the MathML 2.0 recommendation, following RFC 3023: application/mathml+xml You can check section 7.1.3 of the MathML 2.0 Rec.  </s>

<s> Hi Kai,  </s>
<s> The right solution is to include native MathML constructions into your XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> The latest version of Mozilla (0.9.9) now includes support for displaying Presentation MathML and the Math Working Group has made available the "Universal MathML stylesheet" which makes it possible to author a single form of HTML+MathML that will be viewable in many browsers, including IE5.5, IE6 and Mozilla (see http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL).  </s>
