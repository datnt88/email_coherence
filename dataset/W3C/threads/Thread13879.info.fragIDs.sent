<s> Nir pointed out to me that there is a line in the spec which says:  </s>
<s> Each MAP element may contain either one of the following: 1.One or more AREA elements... 2.Block-level content...  </s>
<s> Which means that the two things are not allowed in there together.  </s>
<s> Since the whole thing is getting unwieldy anyway it seems that for the present  </s>
<s> we have Imagemaps, and we use the HTML 4.0 MAP element as a structural division within which we can put navigation bars and similar collections of links.  </s>
<s> Although I can't see why there is that requirement - it takes some flexibility away that may be very useful.  </s>
<s> (Although I can't think of anything except solving the legacy problem that it is useful for.) On the other hand, I can't see where in the spec it says that MAP is an inline.  </s>
<s> In the discussion (7.5.3 Block-level and Inline elements,  </s>
<s> Inline elements generally cannot contain block elements, which MAP specifically can.  </s>
<s> By my reading that means MAP is likely to be a block element, and in any case it seems to me that it is permissible for inline elements to be children of BODY (Although unusual.  </s>
<s> And my understanding was that in practice any inline stuff which was a child of BODY was given a P as its parent.)  </s>
<s> But I have just crashed my browser, so I have stopped checking this.  </s>
<s> (And actually I am not unhappy about the idea of using MAPs with block-level content and waiting for UAs to catch up.  </s>
<s> But I guess it would be hard selling it to authors.) Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> [jumping into that thread without having read all messages]  </s>
<s> In the review of HTML4 for ISO-HTML over the summer, we also found that constraint of the MAP content model.  </s>
<s> I raised this issue internally, but I didn't get much time to push it forward.  </s>
<s> My current thinking is that we should fix it that way: ((area+) | (block+, (area+)?))  </s>
<s> so that both AREA and regular block (e.g. A) is allowed.  </s>
<s> But there is still the issue of backward compatibility of existing browsers.  </s>
<s> The HTML 4.0 specification defines the content model of the MAP element as: !ELEMENT MAP - - ((%block;)+ | AREA+) On my interpretation, this means that MAP can contain either one or more block-level elements, or one or more AREA elements, but not a mixture of AREA and block-level elements.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the SGML | symbol represents an exclusive or, from which this conclusion follows straightforwardly.  </s>
<s> Thus, the implication appears to be that map p [navigational links] would be valid, but as Daniel pointed out, there remains a question of backward compatibility, which can be easily and quickly tested.  </s>
<s> There seems to be general consensus that the spec won't allow both block-level and AREA in the same MAP.  </s>
<s> Which is a shame - block-level content seems a better way to go in the long run.  </s>
<s> In the short term, putting in block-level links means that the links are displayed, but the imagemap doesn't work.  </s>
<s> Which will not recommend it to authors... If we could put in both block-level and AREA, then we would have to change the specification or violate the 'use a valid w3c technology where possible' rule, which I wouldn't do for this.  </s>
<s> There is however no reason why that can't be done in the next lot of HTML and the UA guidelines Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
