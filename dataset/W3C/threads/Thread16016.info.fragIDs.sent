<s> I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in Australia (http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain of its programmes via the web.  </s>
<s> I haven't checked the accessibility of the site, and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several days after the programmes themselves have been broadcast.  </s>
<s> Are other radio stations with a presence on the web adopting similar policies?  </s>
<s> more interestingly check out http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, it's not linked into their main page yet.  </s>
<s> Note that the page is extremely table rich (a euphasism of sorts) --but emacspeak/w3 should give you good access.  </s>
<s> Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc.  </s>
<s> Public Radio International http://www.pri.org/ offers RealAudio transcripts of at least some of their shows.  </s>

<s> The central point here is that providing transcripts of audio content is a requirement under the guidelines, so that if an audio stream is provided, transcripts must also be made available.  </s>
<s> All,  </s>
<s> where is the best place to find our specifics about the issues involved with web pages and color blindness?  </s>
<s> Does anyone know?  </s>
