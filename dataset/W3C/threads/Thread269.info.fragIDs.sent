<s> There are at least two flavors of Tidy for Linux (i.e. the Tidy RPM Package for "Redhat", maintained by Dimitri Papadopoulos and the Tidy on "FreeBSD", maintained by Martin Fouts).  </s>
<s> Are these releases of Tidy generic or interchangeable, among the different Linux operating systems?  </s>
<s> If so, then could one either of these be setup on, say Caldera or SuSE?  </s>
<s> If not, what are the differences and is there a Tidy for Caldera or SuSE?  </s>
