I have the following HTML in a web page - img src="images/charles2.gif" TITLE="charles" ALT="Charles" LONGDESC="images/charles2.html" ALIGN="LEFT" A HREF="images/charles2.html" TITLE="Description of Charles2.gif" 
IMG SRC="images/dot.gif" ALT="D-link" TITLE="link to description of Charles2.gif (previous picture)" /A What it does in Netscape is fairly predictable - there is an image, then a little white dot (on a white background) with a big blue border, linked to a description. 
With Images off, I get two boxes about the same size, one containing an image icon and the text "charles" (the ALT text), followed by one with a blue border, containing the icon and the ALT text "D-link". 
But using MSIE 4, I cannot find the image by any means I know, in any configuration. 
Does anyone have an idea why? 
(this is the same MISE I use to view objects included with the OBJECT tag, which works generally very nicely. 
Does that mean I have some bizarre version nobody has heard of?) Charles McCathieNevile 
I can confirm that the behavior is the same on my Internet Explorer 4.01. 
I 
had a lot of difficulty clicking on the dot - it's really small! 
Tabbing to 
the D-link was not a problem. 
Why would a border be shown in Netscape when no BORDER attribute was specified?

The point was that the ALT text does not appear, since the odds of 
hitting it by accident and getting the tool-tip text are vanishingly 
small. 
In Netscape, the object is displayed at the correct size to fit in the alt text - this is much more friendly. 
Netscape places a border around images used as links by default. 
That way I don't have to guess where the links are and where the plain images are. 
If I wrote a stylesheet I might specify no borders, but I personally find them very handy.

half that doesn't tell me what I'm getting) Charles McCathieNevile 
Okay, but what's the point? 
smile If you want to reserve more space for 
the image, use HEIGHT and WIDTH. 
If you ask me, you're trying to take advantage of a bug in Netscape, which puts borders around images which are a link. 
Is there something in the HTML 4.0 specification that says user agents should indicate when images are anchors? 
Your comment confused me:

Friendlier than what? 
What's the correct size of the object? 
To me, it's the size of the object, which is really small. 
Under IE4.01 with "Show Images" off and "Always Expand ALT Text" on, the entire ALT text of both images is shown.

I 
to 
CMCCN:: it is only when the images are off that I really care - if people are loading the images I assume they don't really need a LONGDESC. 
The border 
around images in general is something I find helpful - rather than guess which are links and which are just images, I can easily see (if I was 
tabbing around I suppose I could find out too, but as a visual user it isn't my normal way of doing it). 
CMCCN:: Aaah. 
A polite way of saying 'read the instructions you idiot'. 
Sorry folks - thanks Chuck. 
Everything is clearer to me now.

On Thu May/14/98 09:12 UTC, David Norris Commented: Ummm, if bordered images are helpful then why not make them reliable across UAs on your site? 
Why not add a style which specifies that anchored images should have a border. 
Rather than hope the UA does it by default. 
I agree that bordered images are often helpful in this way. 
I kind of like the hover pseudo-class implemented in IE4. 
I use it on occasion. 
It is a great cue for visual users when used to slightly change the border color. 
That way if it isn't apparently a link then a visual user gets a hint if they 
pass over it. 
Will something like hover be added to CSS proper at some point? 
Kind of tough to call since its nature is basically an event-driven 
form of the link pseudo-class. 
I haven't been following CSS developments very closely for a few months. 
Something like this for anchored image borders: A:Link IMG {Border: 2px ridge #00F;} IE4 Hover pseudo-class: A:Link IMG {Border: 2px ridge #00F;} A:Hover IMG {Border: 2px ridge #10E;} ,David Norris World Wide Web - http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/1652/
