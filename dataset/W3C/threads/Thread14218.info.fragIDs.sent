<s> High Priority: A.1.3 Anything about the fact that you have to use TITLE on AREA to work with IE4 or IE5?  </s>
<s> It is very unfortunate, and really the fault of IE, but pages only using ALT as these guidelines recommend will not be accessible with IE, whereas if the page used both ALT and TITLE it would be accessible with all browsers.  </s>
<s> I recognize that that would be adding a hack to work around a flaw in a specific browser, so may not be appropriate, but certainly Microsoft's version of these guidelines would have to recommend authors use both.  </s>
<s> A.1.4 Redundant textual links for client-side image maps seems like it should only be pri 3 because we assume the person can find a UA that support keyboard access to client-side image maps.  </s>
<s> That is, it's no more important than avoiding hard-coding colors, which our UA also allows you to override, and you dropped that one altogether because of the readily available workaround.  </s>
<s> Or is this really important for people with cognitive impairments, and if so, should that rationale be called out?  </s>
<s> A.1.5 As with A.1.4, it should be ok to use client side image maps as long as there is ALT on the AREAs so we should reduce priority to 3. A.5.2 This should be Pri 1 if A.5.1 is not done correctly, but only Pri 3 if A.5.1 is done correctly.  </s>
<s> Making this high priority implies that you have to do both, which I don't feel is true.  </s>
<s> A.6.1 Using Hx tags correctly to convey structure is important, but nesting them correctly is not in my opinion.  </s>
<s> I'd say Pri 3. Can you justify why this is higher priority?  </s>
<s> A.6.2 Using OL and UL is Pri 3--it does not provide access, only makes it easier.  </s>
<s> After all, who's to say what lists cross the line from where it's ok to put them in a sentence, say, or as multiple sequential paragraphs, instead of as bulleted lists.  </s>
<s> That seems to intrude on editorial decisions and so should be recommendation only.  </s>
<s> A.6.3 In discussing this with our Web team, I recommend that it is higher priority to make sure that pages can be used when style sheets are turned off than it is to avoid abusing BLOCKQUOTE.  </s>
<s> Therefore if it's important that a paragraph be set off (e.g. indented) I'd use BLOCKQUOTE instead of relying on style sheets.  </s>
<s> What aids or other tools would be adversely affected in real life by this?  </s>
<s> (Remember, these guidelines are about improving accessibility, not enforcing W3C recommendations in general.) A.10.4 There is no A.10.4 but I'd suggest that the Note 1 about is important enough to be listed as a Checkpoint because they are so frequently used and because the general injunction to avoid non-W3C-approved HTML constructs is not specific enough to make people follow it everywhere.  </s>
<s> Also, A.10.2 and A.10.3 can be interpreted as prohibiting BLINK and MARQUEE but they are vaguely enough worded that they can also be interpreted otherwise.  </s>
<s> (For example, does A.10.2 prohibit blinking, or just blinking that causes flicker?  </s>
<s> I would rephrase it to clarify that the two clauses are separate.) A.12 It does not list the basic requirement that there be A around any object that takes mouse input, which seems very important and should be added.  </s>
<s> At least, that's how you do it for IE, and I assume that other UA would also support this.  </s>
<s> Is there some other, more browser-independent way to make sure things that take mouse input are keyboard accessible?  </s>
<s> B.1 I would add a Pri 3 recommendation that they use Hx elements to distinguish structure of the document, although I recognize that it is not enforceable in a programmatic way.  </s>
<s> (It seems somewhat ironic that we think they're important enough to require them to be nested properly, but not important enough to recommend they be used.) B.1.3 FIELDSET should only be required (PRI 1) for check boxes if their labels don't convey enough information to make them understood on their own.  </s>
<s> In other cases it might be lower priority, especially if there are few options in a group.  </s>
<s> B.2.1 I strongly suggest that you add requirement that when link text can't be reasonably worded so as to be understood out of context, that TITLE be used to add longer names for the links that would distinguish them from each other.  </s>
<s> This is a very powerful technique and of much benefit to accessibilty aids and other tools (such as those that provide a list of the links in a page).  </s>
<s> C. This should include explicit steps that testers can take to evaluate their sites manually, such as (a) run with CSS turned off (in IE3), (b) override colors in IE4+, (c) navigate by keyboard, etc.  </s>
<s> You can find out set of steps on http://microsoft.com/enable/dev/web_guidelines.htm .  </s>
<s> Medium Priority: A.14.1 Seems like a Pri 3 to me; why is that a Pri 2? In fact, in many cases the opposite is more beneficial.  </s>
<s> A.14.2 Also recommend it being demoted to Pri 3, as it doesn't necessarily cause accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> If the only problem is one of compatibility with screen readers, then the fact that a good number of UA (like IE, using Active Accessibility, or future UA which could put a default placeholder in as an option) don't have that problem would seem to relegate it to lower priority.  </s>
<s> B.1.5 Use of OPTGROUP should be Pri 3 as it improves usability but not basic accessibility.  </s>
<s> B.2.9 I still say reserved class names like "nav" are a horrible hack that should be replaced by a new attribute.  </s>
<s> What if you have two different nav bars with different styles, such as bars for the first- and second-tier tables of contents?  </s>
<s> Can't do it using these guidelines.  </s>
<s> Lower Priority: A.2.1 Does it describe how to make D links reliably invisible?  </s>
<s> A.3.3 What exactly is meant by played automatically?  </s>
<s> Only startup sounds, or also sounds played automatically in response to user input?  </s>
<s> A.8.1 Just out of curiosity, why still no table attribute specifying whether it's for layout only etc. (as I'd recommended a long time ago)?  </s>
<s> A.8.3 May want to add note that it's appropriate to override the styles so the TH etc. don't look abnormal.  </s>
<s> A.9.3 I'd recommend listing a third alternative mechanism, something simpler like "text links".  </s>
<s> A.13 I'd suggest re-ordering to put the Pri 2's ahead of the Pri 3's, lest people stop reading after hitting the first Pri 3. B.2.10 This should be the UA's job, but since it's PRI 3 I guess it can stand.  </s>
<s> B.3.1 Seems very unrealistic.  </s>
<s> Other comments: B.2.8 The guidelines document violate their own rules by not providing the complete set of guidelines as a single HTML file.  </s>
<s> A.1.3 Anything about the fact that you have to use TITLE on AREA to work with IE4 or IE5?  </s>
<s> It is very unfortunate, and really the fault of IE, but pages only using ALT as these guidelines recommend will not be accessible with IE, whereas if the page used both ALT and TITLE it would be accessible with all browsers.  </s>
<s> I recognize that that would be adding a hack to work around a flaw in a specific browser, so may not be appropriate, but certainly Microsoft's version of these guidelines would have to recommend authors use both.  </s>
<s> Such a change would be altogether unacceptable for the reason cited: its purpose would simply be to avoid a design flaw in a specific browser.  </s>
<s> Since version 5 has not been released yet, Microsoft still has time in which to correct the problem instead of trying to encourage authors to compensate for it; energies would be better directed toward fixing the design fault.  </s>
<s> Also, there should be no "Microsoft version" of these guidelines.  </s>
<s> They are a W3C document and, as such, intended to be definitive of a recommendation.  </s>
<s> It would be inappropriate for any organisation to produce modified versions.  </s>
<s> A.6.1 Using Hx tags correctly to convey structure is important, but nesting them correctly is not in my opinion.  </s>
<s> I'd say Pri 3. Can you justify why this is higher priority?  </s>
<s> Certainly.  </s>
<s> If a user agent, such as a speaking web browser (via the DOM for instance) provides structural navigation of the document, then it becomes possible for the reader to traverse the tree structure directly in order to locate sections of interest.  </s>
<s> If headings are properly nested, then level n +1 headings will always appear below level n headings in the tree, thus providing the correct document structure for navigational purposes.  </s>
<s> It would thus be inappropriate at best, and confusing at worst, for, to take an example, a subsection heading to appear above a section heading in the hierarchy when structural navigation is being used.  </s>
<s> A.6.2 Using OL and UL is Pri 3--it does not provide access, only makes it easier.  </s>
<s> After all, who's to say what lists cross the line from where it's ok to put them in a sentence, say, or as multiple sequential paragraphs, instead of as bulleted lists.  </s>
<s> That seems to intrude on editorial decisions and so should be recommendation only.  </s>
<s> As discussed on this list recently, lists are very useful navigation aids and are of particular benefit when the document is transformed into braille or auditory media, assist in structural navigation, and generally make it easier to comprehend the document.  </s>
<s> For these reasons they are an important tool of document design, and this is recognised in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> A.6.3 In discussing this with our Web team, I recommend that it is higher priority to make sure that pages can be used when style sheets are turned off than it is to avoid abusing BLOCKQUOTE.  </s>
<s> Therefore if it's important that a paragraph be set off (e.g. indented) I'd use BLOCKQUOTE instead of relying on style sheets.  </s>
<s> What aids or other tools would be adversely affected in real life by this?  </s>
<s> (Remember, these guidelines are about improving accessibility, not enforcing W3C recommendations in general.)  </s>
<s> I disagree with the remarks concerning BLOCKQUOTE.  </s>
<s> If this element is used inappropriately, then a speaking browser, a braille translator, etc., will treat the enclosed text as a quotation, thus providing the reader with an inaccurate understanding of the document's content.  </s>
<s> Also, the use of BLOCKQUOTE for purposes of indentation violates the separation of content and presentation.  </s>
<s> This, indeed, is the more fundamental issue, and leads directly to inappropriate presentation in different media (my web browser, for instance, uses a different voice to indicate quoted text, and there is no way of distinguishing, if BLOCKQUOTE is used wrongly, between a genuine quotation and indented text, without making potentially dubious assumptions concerning the structure of the document).As for the claim that the guidelines should not require compliance with W3C recommendations, it would be inconsistent with their status as a W3C document were they not to do so.  </s>
<s> W3C recommendations are intended to enhance interoperability: the compatibility of the web across the entire range of hardware and software environments that may be available.  </s>
<s> Given the different types of input and output devices, operating systems and user agents that a person with a disability may be using, interoperability as facilitated by W3C recommendations is even more relevant to access for people with disabilities than it is to the population of web users in general.  </s>
<s> Thus, these guidelines should be consistent with, and where possible supportive of, other W3C specifications.  </s>
<s> I shall comment on the remaining aspects of these suggestions as the discussion progresses.  </s>
<s> In navigating a structural view as discussed by Jason, with reference to proper nesting of Hx elements, the tree which would be navigated is a semantic structure rather than that explicitly provided by the DOM (in the case of HTML).  </s>
<s> This is in fact common practise in some User Agents, as well as being analagous to the outline view provided by Microsoft Word.  </s>
<s> Since there are very many structured documents on the web, or in the process of being placed on the web, this is an important way to ensure that they can be navigated sensibly.  </s>
<s> The problem caused by an incorrect HTML implementation in IE should be referred to in the techniques document, with appropriate kludges demonstrated.  </s>
<s> However, I concur with Jason that it seems a fairly small task to fix the bug in IE5 before release, and I would have expected Microsoft to make such fixes in the ordinary course of events, or to make  </s>
<s> them as a matter of demonstrating their real commitment to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Given the amount of lead time I am somewhat surprised that this situation has been allowed to develop, although that is water under the bridge now.  </s>
<s> a trivial point.  </s>
<s> It is not necessarily inappropriate for other organisations to produce modified versions of W3C recommendations.  </s>
<s> This issue is treated in some depth in the W3C's process, copyright, and IPR documents.  </s>
<s> In part it says that documents may be modified, provided appropriate attribution is made, the W3C copyright statements are retained with any such modified version, and it is made clear that the modified version is not a W3C recommendation but a modified document which incorporates material from W3C recommendation(s).  </s>
