After In sent the last email about Bell Atlantic's high cost for ADSL, this 
came over the wire.

Not to throw salt on a wound but the cable modem costs me ~ $40 US per month. 
Don't remember the cost of the set-up fee. 
As for a regular dial-up account, USA pays $10-20 for unlimited service. 
I would kill for that pricing to come to the UK :) I pay like 6c/min on peak phone call rates to my LOCAL ISP! ADSL will be charged at $50//month here at 256k upstream and 2mbps downstream and is being released sometime next March... Cheers,

Cox Cable began offering cable modem services in our area of San Diego early last year. 
We waited two years as they installed new cables and our neighborhood finally came on line. 
My connection costs in August were: $99.00 Installation (one time fee to run line from cable box 28.95 monthly charge 9.67 cable modem month rental until prices fall 30.00 purchase of Ethernet card (installed it myself) Please note that the monthly Internet access fee includes a $10 discount as I am also a customer for the Cox cable TV service. 
Hope this information helps.

Hello All. 
I have a quick question. 
What does DSL pricing in the United States have to do with the Web Accessibility Initiative, which I last checked was an extra-national initiative. 
I can understand issues dealing with various US-centric legislation, but Internet Access Prices? 
Please.

I figured people would like to know what the cost is for the new types of connectivity. 
I find it interesting that people are sharing the costs. 
I for one have no idea what the costs are in Europe or Australia, but find it interesting and a way to understand the hurdles or barriers people with disabilities or low income (or both) might have. 
As we want to get more PWDs access to computer and the web, we should be aware what the costs are around the world. 
This is a barrier for not only PWDs but people without significant income. 
If you have the information then you can budget - if your budget permits. 
Brian had a good point, but I think we also need to understand the other barriers to the web - connectivity and PC costs. 
PC costs are more well know than connectivity costs. 
This may be more of a topic for the EO group, but again this has been useful to other WAI IG members as well. 
Happy Holiday!

Concentric will be offering DSL connection in the DC area in conjunction with a partner starting early next year. 
I was checking around when I moven into a new house to see what would be available on my new exchange. 
Turns out Concentric states (believe when seen) that they will have DSL available on my local exchange next March. 
That was one thing that made me pick them over IBM.net when I was switching ISPs.
