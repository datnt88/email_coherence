Hi, all. 
The company I work for is currently trying to do due diligence in correctly implementing the "lang" attribute on the HTML tag as recommended by WCAG guidelines. 
Simple as it may seem, we have run into a few questions for 
which we are not able to find ready sources of answers. 
1) we needed to standardize on one ISO standard for all our language information in our web publishing systems company wide. 
Since the 3-letter ISO 639 code is more complete, we have chosen that. 
The references on the 
W3C guidelines show all the examples using 2 letter codes. 
Will the 
3-letter codes also work? 
e.g., lang="eng-us" or lang="fre" 
2) There are certain dialects for which we can not find a satisfactory 
representation in W3C documentation. 
Are there standard ISO / W3C representations for these languages? 
if so, what are they? 
The languages we are struggling with are: 
Traditional Chinese 
Simplified Chinese 
Latin American Spanish 
Any answers you could provide would be appreciated. 
Also, if there is an 
online reference that spells these things out I would love to bookmark it and share it with my colleagues. 
Much obliged, Melinda 
This is really an internationalisation question, but since it is required for accessibility it makes sense to look for answers here. 
three letter codes: According to XML 1.0 second edition you must use the two-letter codes -- http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag - and although it seems to foreshadow moving to 3-letter codes that change doesn't appear to have been made in the draft of XML 1.1. 
Same thing goes for HTML -- Dialects: According to that bit in the HTML spec, you can identify languages as spoken in a particular country. 
Since simplified or traditional chinese are the common forms in different countries you 
might be able to use that. 
Latin American Spanish is not, in any case, a single dialect - so you may as well identify the source country... 
just my 2 bits worth - there are people more expert at internationalisation than me Chaals

Hello Melinda, Charles, 
The use of language codes is described by RFC3066 (which obsoletes RFC1766). 
See the erratum E41 for the XML spec I have requested a similar erratum for the HTML spec, and I believe it is close to happening. 
You should use RFC3066 anyway, as it is backwards compatible with RFC1766. 
RFC3066 says you should use the 2-letter codes where available - ensures better interoperability. 
So English should be 'en' not 'eng'. 
3-letter codes can be used where there is no 2-letter code. 
The last time I looked (and I don't suspect it has changed) there was no 
code for Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese (note that these are 
actually scripts rather than languages). 
Common practise in the localisation industry seems to be zh-TW for Traditional and zh-CN for Simplified (actually meaning taiwanese chinese and (mainland) china 
chinese, respectively). 
For South America I don't know the answer, although I must say I've wanted to know for some time. 
In terms of online references, you may find It's great to see that you are adding the lang tag to the html tag. 
Note also (I had a discussion with WCAG about this just last week) that if you are writing XHTML (which is a good idea, by the way) you should also have a xml:lang as well as a lang attribute. 
That is not yet in the WCAG guidelines, but hopefully will be soon. 
I hope this helps. 
Best, Richard.

Hi Richard and Melinda, Charles is right, a Latin America Spanish doesn't exist. 
The Spanish language exists (es) and diverse forms exist of using that language in diverse countries, for example, Spanish that one speaks in Spain that is coded: es-es, the one that one speaks in Mexico: es-mx, the one that one speaks in Argentina: es-ar, etc. 
It happens like in English that there is difference among the form of using it and of being expressed in Great Britain, United States, Australia, etc. Cheers, Emmanuelle Hello Melinda, Charles, The use of language codes is described by RFC3066 (which obsoletes RFC1766).

I have never seen them used in a web context, so I'd be surprised if any of the limited contexts in which they are used would recognize them. 
Conventionally zh-tw. 
Note that there will be significant dialect differences between this and zh-hk, but this is the one for generic material. 
(There is actually a Hong Kong supplemental character set.) 
Conventionally zh-cn.
