I just loaded Amaya 8.0 GL on my P 4 system running win xp pro with all current upgrades etc. 
I have discovered that when I move or close or minimize the graphics, SVG library, or the timeline windows both windows including the browser/editor window close and I have to restart the program. 
The same thing happens if I open one of the above with the menu button and then click the button again as if to close. 
Upon opening I first must make a selection in the Confirm popup window ?your 
previous Amaya session failed. 
Do you want to reload backup documents? 
Any suggestions? 
Eli Could you give us some informations about your graphics card ? 
Manufacturer (nvidia, matrox, ati, st microelectronics, etc) -Paul I hope you received my personal email regarding this: My graphics is a part of this chipset.
