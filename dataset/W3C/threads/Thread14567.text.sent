Noting that the list I prepared of authors of techniques is a bit scrappy, here is a compilation of the posts that are uncertain, or need to be confirmed. 
Although most of the techniques have multiple editors (i.e. it doesn't matter if one drops out), the following have shaky positions:- HTML: Kynn (not confirmed) Kynn, are you working on techniques for 4.01-3.2? 
You suggested it, and I volunteered you automatically, but you didn't actually say anything... Server Side Scripting: Cynthia (not confirmed) Somebody said that Cynthia would want to work on this, but I don't think she confimed that. 
XHTML m12n (?/Sean) CSS Styling for XML (?/Sean) Is anyone going to work with me on these? 
[Actually, I note that techniques for XHTML m12n would be a directly governed by XMLGL, because m12n involves creating an XML language, albeit with respect to XHTML... which is very interesting.] 
CSS styling for XML will probably just be a cut down version of CSS for HTML, with the features generalized, and with more CSS3-type tips.

HTML: Kynn (not confirmed) Yeah, I probably should have objected :), because I don't know how much time I will have to devote to this at present. 
Server Side Scripting: Cynthia (not confirmed) I -could- work on this with Cynthia (but couldn't do it alone, clearly). 
--Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
I'd be happy to work on this, but probably won't have time before the f2f. 
Kynn are you going to Boston? 
Can we spend a few hours pounding this out Monday or Tuesday?

I'll be there! 
So, yeah, this is a good plan. 
Looking forward to it!

I signed up to help with server-side scripting and XHTML. 
Not sure if that was captured anywhere, though.
