<s> I would like to recommend the following to address math issues: 1.  </s>
<s> If a user agent or plug in renders mathematical equations it should use mathml for the representation  </s>
<s> 2. Specify that XML document models are exposed to assistive technologies, just like HTML model.  </s>
<s> This would make MathML element available to assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> 3. Integrated navigation od mathematical equations into the checkpoints on access every element sequentially and navigating the DOM.  </s>
<s> Please comment.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure I understand this one.  </s>
<s> If equations are represented by MathML, then document tree navigation should suffice.  </s>
<s> Is there need to mention math explicitly?  </s>

<s> I ment to say examples of math navigation would be part of the techniques document for those two checkpoints.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints themsleves would remain as agreed on in the May 5 telecon.  </s>
