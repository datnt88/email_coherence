<s> Personally I am not sure I need yet another device to make the web accessible but rather I need folks to follow accessible web design practices.  </s>

<s> December 2, 1999 New Disabled Web Site Unveiled By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK -- The publisher of a magazine for the disabled unveiled a new Web site and tools Thursday to make the Internet more accessible to the blind and other disabled users.  </s>
<s> To take advantage of some features, users of We Media Inc.'s site would need to buy such special equipment as a vibrating mouse that lets the blind ``feel'' boxes and images on the computer screen.  </s>
<s> Walter Cronkite, the former CBS anchorman who acts as an adviser to the site, called the new tools ``the ultimate prosthetic.'' The tools will enable the disabled to do such things as take online college courses and participate in discussion groups, he said.  </s>
<s> The announcement comes a month after the National Federation of the Blind sued America Online, calling its software incompatible with programs that convert text to audio or Braille.  </s>
<s> According to the Census Bureau, one in 10 Americans has a severe disability such as blindness.  </s>
<s> The for-profit site at www.wemedia.com,  </s>
<s> affiliated with the publisher of We magazine, will go into operation Friday, though some of the services and tools won't be available for weeks or months.  </s>
<s> The site will offer shopping and access to online college courses, chat rooms, lists of jobs at accessible workplaces and real estate brokers who specialize in accessible homes.  </s>
<s> The software will be written so that the Web page is compatible with such tools as the vibrating mouse.  </s>
<s> Several other sites cater to the disabled.  </s>
<s> Some of the access tools are also available already.  </s>
<s> We Media, however, brings both elements together; it designs accessible sites and works with hardware companies to develop tools for the disabled.  </s>
<s> For example, someone with paralysis or other motor impairment could surf the site using technology that detects eye movement.  </s>
<s> A blind person could use the vibrating mouse to feel and listen to the site's visual content.  </s>
<s> The mouse works with software to convert text into computerized voices.  </s>
<s> The mouse will sell for several hundred dollars, though We Media is seeking arrangements with nonprofit partners to buy the tools in bulk and offer them for free or at a subsidized price.  </s>
<s> Laurence Bergman, We Media's product manager, likened the one-time purchase to that of a wheelchair.  </s>
<s> John Doyle, a blind college student from Montreal, said the new mouse expands what he could do on the Internet.  </s>
<s> He has an easier time with shopping sites that ask for credit card and other information.  </s>
<s> ``Before it was difficult to fill out this registration info.  </s>
<s> I'd have to ask someone with sight to do it,'' he said, demonstrating the technology.  </s>
<s> ``This allows me to do anything a sighted person would do on the Web.'' So far, We Media is the only Web site to use coding compatible with the vibrating mouse.  </s>
<s> But the maker of the mouse, Haptic Technologies, hopes other sites will ultimately adopt the coding as well.  </s>
<s> Richard Ring, a blind Web user who runs the International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind, said a vibrating mouse would be useful, particularly if it worked throughout the Internet.  </s>
<s> ``I wouldn't want to be limited to using a special Web site any more than you would,'' he said.  </s>
<s> I don't think this website has anything to do with the aol/nfb thing so can't understand why it was mentioned here.  </s>
<s> that notwithstanding, havingnot yet seen the site or finished the article, there are many good reasons for exploring the technology.  </s>
<s> I shall finish and publish a finding on the lists to which this message does not bounce.  </s>
