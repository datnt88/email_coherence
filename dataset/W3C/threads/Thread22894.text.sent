I note that in the DOM level 2 Events spec, the load event is specified only for a document, frameset and object, not for img. 
The implementations in Mozilla and Opera seem to bear this out. 
Is there a good reason for this? 
Is there an alternative recommended way to preload images and fire events when they are ready?

AG Hi Andrew, You can preload images via JavaScript. 
This is how some designers change images on mouse over by changing the image from their preloaded image array. 
According to HTML 4.0, script is allowed in head, and my recollection is that head is guaranteed to be loaded first. 
I'm not sure on the loading thing though. 
Hope this helps, Eric :-) That's out-of-scope for the DOM, of course. 
We just provide hooks; implementing script/ and so on is left to higher-level code. 
I believe the reason we mention Load events only in conjuction with specific nodes is to avoid breaking existing scripts. 
HTML says explicitly which nodes will receive this event; if others start getting it, page behavior might change. 
(Folks mayt not be checking the target node, so a new Load might cause a listener to fire at the wrong time.) Note that if the higher-level code fires any event event against a node, the DOM doesn't care which node it was -- it just propigates the event through its normal capture-and-bubble sequence. 
So if your code sent a Load event to an img/ , the right thing would happen. 
But it seems that the HTML 4.01 spec says that won't happen automatically in a normal HTML DOM. 
It sounds like what you really want is an HTML extension, not just a a DOM extension.
