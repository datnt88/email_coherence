The Editor's TODO list is now complete. 
I've added entries for all the Editorial issues. 
Some of them I've split into multiple entries ( check the CVS log for details ). 
Some of them have comments from me, I'd like feedback from the other editors regarding these comments/proposed courses of action. 
I'll be working on issue resolutions this afternoon, Gudge Here you are... Jean-Jacques. 
221: I think the resolution is problematic. 
Agree. 
286: Add '(which may or may not also be SOAP intermediaries)' to first note? 
Sounds reasonnable. 
289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault? 
Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender ( or previous intermediary)? 
Since we don't indicate what happens when faults are generated in the first place, I think the most we can say is that intermediaries MAY forward fault messages. 
However, I am wondering whether this is not raising a deeper issue, which is how intermediaries forward response messages. 
I think sections 2.7.* are written from the POV of request messages; do they cover adequately response messages? 
334a: Mention SOAP Response MEP???? 
I don't think we need to. 
I also don't think we should. 
334b: Seems to me that MEPs are one of the extensibility points in SOAP... So what do we need to say??? 
I'm confused by the issue as well. 
Ignore? 
335: I don't think we need to change it, it is only an example... Agree. 
352a: When refering to the QNames of types use QName production ( prefix:localname ) rather than 'localname' I think this would improve readability (although, strictly speaking, prefix should be replaced by the corresponding URI ;-)). 
352b: Use textual identifiers for references rather than numerics I believe I have done this already about two months ago, after this were pointed out for WSDL... BTW, this is not a stylesheet issue, we only need to change the key in the bibtex entry (or whatever the XML production name is). 
352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'. 
The better long term solution would be to create and use a new XML element. 
We should then s/[/ prop /. 353a: Provide examples of 'struct' and 'array' from some programming language I agree with Marc, we should not do this. 
I also think this is out of scope for the primer. 
353b: Provide at least one example for each section Possibly. 
353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for encoding Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such. 
20020820 MJG Works for me. 
357: Change DataEncodingUnknown to SOAPEncodingUnknown Sounds good. 
373: suspect this issue really needs to be kicked 'upstairs' to the WG. Agree. 
Jean-Jacques, Thanks for the feedback, I'll update the edtodo accordingly Cheers Gudge From: Jean-Jacques Moreau [mailto:moreau@crf.canon.fr]

Well, my fever finally broke late this weekend, after hanging on all week. 
I was back at the office for a half day yesterday, and expect nearly a full day to day. 
Within the next day or so, will try and get to my first tentative contributions as an editor. 
Sorry for all the delays. 
I am also lurking on xmlp-eds today. 
If there are any suggestions for one or two near-trivial and non-time-critical issues that I might tackle, just to make sure I get the mechanics right, that would probably be helpful. 
Sorry for all the delays in getting back up to speed. 
I have postponed the vacation we'd aimed for this coming weekend (until next weekend). 
so I'll have a few days to make at least some contributions (while digging out from 10 days of missed work.) Thanks. 
Noah Mendelsohn Voice: 1-617-693-4036 One Rogers Street Cambridge, MA 02142 Noah, Glad to hear you are feeling better, sorry to hear that your vacation has been delayed. 
Looking at the edtodo list, you might like to tackle 352, Section 8 XLink. 
It's just a deletion ( although that means adding markup and adding an entry to the change log at the end of both part 1 and Part 2 and also updating the edtodo. 
). 
Should ensure that your CVS stuff is working properly Gudge OK, I'll try it this afternoon. 
As noted in the IRC log a minute ago, I can't get to the todo list, presuming I'm looking in the right place. 
Off to lunch for 15 mins or so, back shortly. 
Thanks.

Subject: RE: Edtodo is now uptodate Noah, Glad to hear you are feeling better, sorry to hear that your vacation has been delayed. 
Looking at the edtodo list, you might like to tackle 352, Section 8 XLink. 
It's just a deletion ( although that means adding markup and adding an entry to the change log at the end of both part 1 and Part 2 and also updating the edtodo. 
). 
Should ensure that your CVS stuff is working properly Gudge Getting up to speed - just looking at part 1 and 2 and noted a few nits--otherwise looks great: * In the inserted paragraph in section 3.1: "The term 'SOAP Module' refers to the set of syntax and semantics associated with implementing a particular feature (see 3.1 SOAP Features) as SOAP headers. 
A Module is described in a Module Specification, which adheres to the following rules. 
It:" It uses the term "SOAP header". 
I think we should be careful and use "SOAP header blocks" as otherwise people get confused as to whether we mean *the* SOAP header or blocks. 
If you are ok then I can fix this. 
* I don't understand the paragraph in section 3.2: "MUST, if* the Module implements a Feature which has already been defined elsewhere, clearly refer to that Feature's URI. 
Note that a Module may EITHER explicitly refer to a separate Feature in this way OR may implicitly define a Feature simply by describing the semantics of the Module." 
Is that a cut&amp;paste error? 
* In section 5.4.5, in the inserted paragraph: "The Detail element information item MAY be present in a SOAP fault in which case it carries additional information relative to the SOAP fault codes describing the fault (see 5.4.6 SOAP Fault Codes). 
For example, the Detail element information item might contain information about a message not containing the proper credentials, a timeout, etc. 
The presence of the Detail element information item has no significance as to which parts of the faulty SOAP message were processed." 
I think the last sentence easily can be misread to say that a detail element says nothing about whether parts of the message processing succeeded and parts failed. 
However, we know that a SOAP fault is for the whole message and not parts of the message. 
What I think we want to say is this: "The presence of the Detail element information item has no significance as to which parts of the faulty SOAP message failed during processing." Thanks! 
Henrik Can we get the outstanding resolutions in before we start questioning the existing resolutions. 
We will all need to re-read the spec and catch this kind of thing but I'd rather do it AFTER we've done the work. 
We have a deadline of Sept 3rd.

OK, how should we proceed. 
This issue is closed as far as the WG is concerned. 
286: Add '(which may or may not also be SOAP intermediaries)' to first note? 
Done. 
289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault? 
Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender ( or previous intermediary)? 
Good question. 
What do the other editors think? 
334a: Mention SOAP Response MEP???? 
I don't think we need to. 
Done, issue closed in edtodo 334b: Seems to me that MEPs are one of the extensibility points in SOAP... So what do we need to say??? 
That's my gut feeling. 
Issue closed in edtodo 335: I don't think we need to change it, it is only an example... Done. 
Entry closed in edtodo. 
352a: When refering to the QNames of types use QName production ( prefix:localname ) rather than 'localname' Well, given we state in the intro what the prefixes map to that isn't necessary. 
I'll do a pass through the spec and make this change. 
352b: Use textual identifiers for references rather than numerics You are correct, this has already been done. 
Thanks. 
352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'. 
OK, I'll put in the appropriate markup and update the stylesheet. 
353a: Provide examples of 'struct' and 'array' from some programming language OK. Closed in the edtodo 353b: Provide at least one example for each section 353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for encoding Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such. 
20020820 MJG Done. 
357: Change DataEncodingUnknown to SOAPEncodingUnknown 373: suspect this issue really needs to be kicked 'upstairs' to the WG. OK. Mail sent to xml-dist-app.[1] 
Cheers Gudge [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2002Aug/0028.html 221: I think the resolution is problematic. 
The only thing we can do is re-open the issue and state why. 
I did this for one of the other post LC issues and the resolution was changed - I can;t remember the issue number off hand. 
289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault? 
Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender ( or previous intermediary)? 
I think this is a deeper issue. 
Does the behaviour differ depending on whether the fault is due to something the intermediary did or a prior node in the message path ? 
Is there a difference between a request and response message as far as intermediaries are concerned ? 
How would an intermediary determine the difference ?

BTW: #sysreq's best minds are trying to figure out my lack of CVS access as we speak. 
With any luck, they should have it set just as you finish all the edits, or failaing that, in time for my vacation mid- next week. 
Seriously, I am trying to get this turned on so I can do at least a bit of work with you all prior to the Sept. 3 target. 
So far, they're still scratching heads.

Sorry for the delay--here are my comments... 221: I think the resolution is problematic. 
Yup... I will follow-up on dist-app. 
286: Add '(which may or may not also be SOAP intermediaries)' to first note? 
Yes, although there are some combinations that violate HTTP and some that don't. 
I think it is ok that we don't go into that here. 
289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault? 
Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender ( or I think so: As we don't say anything about how the forwarding feature is defined for any SOAP messages other than stating that it is a feature, this would also apply to SOAP faults--they are just a certain type of SOAP messages. 
334a: Mention SOAP Response MEP???? 
I don't think we need to. 
334b: Seems to me that MEPs are one of the extensibility points in SOAP... So what do we need to say??? 335: I don't think we need to change it, it is only an example... 352a: When refering to the QNames of types use QName production ( prefix:localname ) rather than 'localname' Yeah, but as I think we have the table up front in the document, I think that's fine. 
352b: Use textual identifiers for references rather than numerics ok 352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'. 
Hmm, now they look like [references]--I think I would prefer some other stylistic solution. 
353a: Provide examples of 'struct' and 'array' from some programming language yup 353b: Provide at least one example for each section I would say no--we just moved all examples to primer. 
353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for encoding Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such. 
20020820 MJG 357: Change DataEncodingUnknown to SOAPEncodingUnknown I actually prefer DataEncodingUnknown because "SOAPEncoding" is used to mean the encoding defined in part 2 while this subcode can apply to any encoding. 
I don't understand this--their issue [1] says that we are not required to do this and I think we pushed back on this some time ago, no? Hope this makes sense, Henrik [1] http://www.w3.org/International/Group/2002/charmod-lc/#C062 [inline] 352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'. 
They have always looked like references. 
All I've done is go through and put [] around some instances of Infoset properties that did not have them ( mainly in Part 2 ) . 
The reason they look like references is because that is the style the Infoset spec[1] uses. 
Gudge [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/ 
So Henrik seems to be saying this is out of scope and should be defined by the corresponding routing/forwarding feature only, which sounds fine. 
Do we want some additional text saying just that or is the spec ok as is?
