So we could create a technique that says, in effect, "If your target browser includes IE, the author must use relative font sizes. 
"Must"? 
*"Must"*?! 
Just give us an alternate stylesheet and an accessible way to select it. 
Or ask people to grow up and use a better browser. 
Newsflash: Even if you must or simply wish to use Windows, you have a wide range of improved browsers at your disposal. 
There *is* no public Web page for which IE *on Windows* (always make that clarfication) is not a "target." 
This is a really genteel and nicely-polished way of keeping the same broken WCAG 1.0 requirement. 
If your target browser is only Opera, the author can use absolute sizes and still be assured that the page will be WCAG-compliant for the user." 
Oh, now who the hell targets for *only* Opera? 
Some authors customize for MOSe browsers (Mozilla/Opera/Safari Enhancement, http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/06/25/mose/ ), but I have simply never heard of anyone writing an entire site only for Opera. 
There are a few features people put in that only Opera gets right, but people do that with Safari, too. 
(Like me.) WCAG WG continues to pretend that the concept of progressive enhancement does not exist and is not already being followed by designers. 
I would suggest Googling it; I have a large folder of bookmarks on that topic I can wrangle later. 
It is of course the author's responsibility to be realistic about the browsers used by their audience and not try to use this browser profiling as a way to wriggle out of the techniques, but a WCAG WG is telling authors to be realistic? 
We'll start when you start. 
and the techniques are easily updated if we become aware of a browser with its own issues. 
Easily updated? 
You people can't get past the issue of abbreviations and acronyms.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ One point of clarification: if you have to use a screen reader and you use Windows, then you pretty much have to use Internet Explorer. 
This is not because of any inherent superiority in IE, but because none of the screen readers support Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, Opera, or even Lynx. 
At least this was true about a year ago when I queried Freedom Scientific, GW-Micro, and Dolphin. 
Whether or not that's as it *should* be isn't the point-- there *should* be more choice. 
But there isn't.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ I know. 
And most people using screen readers have so little usable vision that making fonts bigger is irrelevant.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ Most _blind_ people. 
It is apparently becoming more common (this is, in my not entirely representative experience) for people with dyslexia to use screen readers. 
For these people it is not at all irrelevant. 
There is also a trade-off to be made beteween functionality of the software (advanced screen readers with Internet explorer certainly provide the most features) and stability, since advanced screen readers are very complex programs which mean even the relatively stable Windows XP can be expected to crash several times a day. 
One way to reduce the impact of this is to live with less powerful tools, gaining in stability. 
Neither of these are, at the time of writing, the majority experience of screen reader users. 
I just wanted to be sure that the working group doesn't fall into the trap of designing for one aprt of the user community because they forget that there are others out there.
