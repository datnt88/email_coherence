Dear all, 
I wondered if anyone had any links or research information about accessibility and usability issues for older users.

Hi Pete! 
You might would like to have a look here: http://psychology.wichita.edu/optimalweb/older_adults.htm 
What about having also a look at my forum? 
I have a lot of very good resources: http://www.webnauts.net/phpBB2/index.php 
Kind regards, John Dear all, 
I wondered if anyone had any links or research information about accessibility and usability issues for older users.

Hi Pete, Here are some articles/publications you might find useful. 
1) Older adults are getting online: 2) Print Legibility and partial sight: 3) Color contrast and partial sight: Hope this is helpful.

Most older people will not have been brought up with computers. 
Most young computer users think that GUIs are easy to use but fail to realise the amount of knowledge they have built up with continual exposure to them. 
Some elderly will have memory problems, making it impossible to learn. 
Most others will be afraid of failing or doing something wrong, whereas young children learn techology easily because they have no fear of it. 
Even those with sound memories will try and write themselves instructions, and the number of design conventions on web sites these days is so large that you would probably need to give someone a year's course on web browsing before they were confident, not just write a one page crib sheet. 
It will probably take several lessons to get even a well motivated user comfortable with the use of a mouse, if, like most retired people, they have never used one before. 
People who have had cataract operations, and maybe more generally, will typically have bi-focal glasses that are OK for reading a book or distance use, but the right distance for a screen will fall halfway between their usable range. 
I attended a usability conference last winter at Fidelity Investments in Boston. 
One presentation was on "Web Usability and Age: How Design Changes Can Improve Performance. 
The presenter was Ann Chadwick-Dias, Principal Human Factors Engineer of Human Interface Design at Fidelity. 
The study compared users under 55 with those over 55 with tasks related to changing their financial information online (401k and stocks ). 
Tasks were performed on an 800X600 17" display. 
The presentation was excellent, here are a few things I learned -- they're from the slides and my personal notes. 
Results from the original unadulterated design: - text size did not increase success though the over 55 audience preferred larger text 
- older users were slower to click and more cautious about clicking - older users spend more time reading text and instructions 
- they have difficulty reading text on screen 
- they were more likely to click non-link items (i.e. bullets, headings, icons, etc. but sometimes didn't click even when they saw the "hand" indicating that something was a link) 
- have difficulty with window management (pop-ups) - have difficulty with mouseover navigation Results from the revised design: Note: This new design added text to explain icons, made icons links, simplified choices, reduced unnecessary text, created a my profile page, added concise instructions, larger fonts for account totals, added totals to top and bottom of page. 
- the 2nd version improved the overall usability for both young and old audiences (increased task performance) - older users clicked significantly faster than in first design study - use of action words appeared to compel older users to click with more confidence (action terms such as "go to 401K" or "view 401K" vs the simple "401K" helped users understand that these were links) - the more clear the resulting action for the link, the more likely older users will click it (and the faster they will click it) - the more the older users have a positive experience with a site, the more they'll use it and the less anxiety they'll have. 
KEEP your visual design and layout STABLE...don't introduce needless changes. 
- regardless of level of computer experience, older users continue to have lower performance than their younger counterparts. 
Some Suggestions from her findings: - use a hover color for links (give user feedback) - user a larger target for clicking (no small images) - keep design simple and stable, don't introduce lots of changes, be consistent - see AARP.org (older wiser wired) - older users don't understand web terms: window, login, link, URL, menu bar, toolbar, minimize, go back, home etc. - do NOT use web terms without defining them - have motor and vision issues to keep in mind - don't use unnecessary text because they will read ALL of it! - even though it does not increase performance provide a way to increase the fonts, like using a visible button to change the text size or use scalable fonts. 
(they PREFER larger text) - older users have difficulty clicking on text links because the target is too small. 
- use images to increase the target size of links - be consistent with links: ex. blue underline, red mouseover, purple visited. 
- increase redundancy in links by linking text AND bullets, this increases the chances that an older user will reach their target - keep information in simple bite-sized chunks so users do not have to read it all and remember it from one page view to the next In a third test Ms. Chadwick-Dias found that older users were less trusting than younger users. 
However, it was argued that this could have been related to the content -- they were asked to make changes to their investments. 
I hope this helps.

I would say this was a consequence of the way that links are hidden. 
I don't think they would have any problem if links always looked the same, but pages often hide links in several different ways on the same page, so people who are not experienced web page users resort to hunt the link tactics. 
I suspect this could even happen if you used the standard link presentation and only that, because they will have been taught by other pages that almost anything can be a link, but not learned the level of detail needed to reverse engineer the design to actually predict which really are links. 
These are both symptoms of a fear of doing things wrong. 
(Note that you seem to have started from the assumption that such people know how to use Windows. 
Some may at the lower end of your age range, but most won't at the high end.) 
Dear Pete, I've just been involved in a study for the DTI on the accessibility of Digital Television. 
As part of that we conducted usability/accessibility assessments on a number of set-top boxes with 12 older adults. 
Within that study we found that apart from obvious usability no-no's, such as lack of consistency, by far the biggest problem was that the interfaces had been constructed as a mish-mash of analogue television, computer and VCR paradigms. 
While the older adults were generally OK with the first and last of these, it was the new PC bits that confused them. 
For example, the new pop-up menus on teletext-type services, and the need to press OK/Select every time they wanted to activate something (on analogue TV there is no equivalent of this function - every time you press a button something happens, the TV doesn't just sit there doing nothing). 
The full report is available at: and the detailed usability/accessibility assessment is Appendix E, at: Regards, Simeon

You're right, this is exactly what the presenter said about links. 
And your comment below about caution and lack of experience with Windows, and computers in general, is important to note. 
Both these factors increase the need for consistency with older user groups. 
Otherwise it seems like a web site is a lot like navigating a minefield for them, they hunt for what they want and when they find a word (or something) that looks like it may take them to their goal, they think about it carefully (lacking confidence in the outcome) and decide to take the risk of clicking. 
I actually saw video footage from these studies and the amount hesitation was remarkable. 
Again, 
the stakes were high as they were supposed to be managing online investments. 
I'm curious to know if they were as hesitant surfing other 
more casual types of websites. 
In that application, even I, as an experienced web user, would be nervous unless told right at the beginning exactly where the commit point was in the dialogue. 
(I find this a problem in e-shopping as a whole, as one often has to take the dialogue a long way to find out things like pricing a shipping options.) 
Investment and airline booking are very high risk applications for users, because they cannot cancel without incurring significant costs, once they pass the commit point.
