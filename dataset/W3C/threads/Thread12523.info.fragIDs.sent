<s> Well, there are three perspectives here.  </s>
<s> Geoff sees the document as  </s>
<s> "fundamentally flawed in its generalisation".  </s>
<s> Matt seems to think it is not sufficiently complete to cover what Geoff needs.  </s>
<s> And I maintain that in fact the guidelines document pretty much gets it right.  </s>
<s> What is important, in my opinion, are the techniques which demonstrate how to do this in different types of system.  </s>
<s> Lookng briefly over the techniques work it is clear that there has been some substantial work done since the group started, but there is a need for more.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a few detailed suggestions about what is missing would help determine whether they are the sort of thing that should be a new checkpoint, or whether they are in fact techniques for existing checkpoints.  </s>
<s> cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> My point is, as it stands, ATAG2 does not clearly define each of these authoring environments and classify its guidelines accordingly.  </s>
<s> ATAG2, as a document, bundles all these tools into the one basket, not defining which classification of tools should be compliant with which set of guidelines.  </s>
<s> Matt May responded: This is because the draft is incomplete.  </s>
<s> It is an omission which is being remedied in the process of moving things forward.  </s>
<s> We _will not_ be allowed to proceed to Recommendation if we do not have this functionality.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid I don't see it as incomplete, I see it as fundamentally flawed in its sweeping generalisations.  </s>
<s> For it to have got to this stage and in this form indicates to me that the people working on this document just do not understand this concern.  </s>
<s> Maybe I am mad and just an isolated case, and maybe there is evidence for that:-), but when I have raise this issue with other developers I feel they also share this despair at the quality of technical competence in addressing these issues.  </s>
<s> I think there is a more general point to be made here, which applies across guidelines and is not specific to ATAG:  </s>
<s> It is better to make guidelines conditional on the characteristics of software or content, rather than to design them around a classification thereof.  </s>
<s> The main reason for this preference is that such classifications tend to become artificial and problematic as technologies and practices evolve.  </s>
<s> Further, the purposes of guidelines are better served not by trying to categorize, but by clearly stating and documenting the preconditions under which individual guidelines or success criteria apply.  </s>
<s> This way, the guidelines continue to work when conventional categories break down.  </s>
<s> In WCAG for example, we do not try to classify content in any of the conventional ways, e.g., static vs. dynamic, page vs. Web application, document vs. user interface, client-side vs. server-side adaptation, etc., and I think the WCAG working group should resist such categorizations exactly on the grounds sketched above.  </s>
<s> Instead, it is vital to make clear the preconditions under which each conformance requirement applies; conventional categorizations may be referred to for purposes of explanation or illustration, but not, in my opinion, in the normative text, which should focus on characteristics of content rather than on imposing a classification scheme.  </s>
<s> I suggest the same holds for other guidelines as well.  </s>
<s> I understand your explanation to not try to create categories or to use classification that eventually breakdown.  </s>
<s> However, I think there is also a problem in creating the "preconditions under which individual guidelines or success criteria apply."  </s>
<s> I think the problem, or need, is to better define the boundary between the tool, the content, and the browser and the overlap between the guideline documents.  </s>
<s> WCAG applies to the content, and ATAG applies to the tool, but who is responsible when the content is the tool or is affected by the tool?  </s>
<s> For example, when pseudo content is entered by the developer for the purpose of giving instructions to the tool regarding the eventual content that is created and delivered to the browser - is that pseudo content part of WCAG's guidelines, or ATAG, or both?  </s>
<s> Think of a Web services scenario where the traditional roles of author, tool, and content changes several times throughout out the life cycle.  </s>
<s> A software developer creates a tool called a portal server that facilitates the delivery of web services (content and tools) to application developers who create portal applications that are used by end users that also have the option (or responsibility) to edit and customize the tool and content independent of the browser and/or AT customization.  </s>
<s> We have been very diligent in defining the guidelines for content, authoring tool, and browser, but sometimes there are gray areas, or preconditions, that have yet to be clarified across all three guidelines.  </s>
<s> ATAG was designed primarily as guidance to the developers of the tool or software.  </s>
<s> And WCAG is inherently part of ATAG because the resulting content produced by the tool needs to comply, it's just *when* does the content need to comply?  </s>
<s> - at each stage in it's life cycle, only when real people come in contact with the content or tool's user interface, or only when it is finally delivered to the end user?  </s>
<s> Since many of us consider the full life cycle in WAI guidelines, the UAAG guidelines come into the equation because some of the responsibility relies on the browser (and also implied is the end user).  </s>
<s> I think more guidance may be needed to direct developers (especially in complex situations) to use and understand the guidelines in all three documents.  </s>
<s> We as WAI members need to also review all three sets of guidelines to insure they in fact do not conflict and do in fact provide all the preconditions needed to understand them correctly.  </s>
<s> The developers of tools and content need to understand all three when determining if they comply or if they need to comply.  </s>

<s> Hi everyone, I'm on the move at present but can make a proper reply to this around 30th/31st.  </s>
<s> Geoff  </s>
<s> [to Xtech, Bcc AU, since this is very much cross-guideline discussion] I agree with Phill that there is a question to be solved about where responsibilities lie between user agents and Web Content.  </s>
<s> I think that this isn't such an important question for authoring tools, since the answer for them is most sensibly "whatever WCAG and UAAG work out between them".  </s>
<s> This is important - there is no sense in expecting that people who use authoring tools do one thing, and people who follow WCAG by hand do something else, since that just leads to User Agents having to develop for two different sets of content.  </s>
<s> ATAG 1 seems pretty clear that it means to apply the principles of accessibility throughout the design cycle - having systems that don't allow people with disabilities to create content would fail one of the explicit goals of ATAG 1.  </s>
<s> I agree also that what should be discussed first are the characteristics of a situation, but to get to those we need to begin in the real world with particular software, applications, etc.  </s>
<s> Likewise, to test these, we need to check different real-world situations.  </s>
<s> The abstraction just helps us get away from producing a list of good ideas lacking a coherent logical explanation for why some are included and others aren't.  </s>
<s> And in particular I agree with Phill that checking across the guidelines for consistency is a crucial part of the development - when I was a WAI employee I tended to insist on it as a condition of participation in my areas of responsibility.  </s>
<s> However there is also a need to recognise the overlap that the real world imposes.  </s>
<s> If developers all worked in harmony with each other and WAI, we could assume that real people could get tools with a particular set of characteristics.  </s>
<s> Naturally enough, this doesn't happen in practice, and people's tools are not so consistent.  </s>
<s> We can therefore either take account of this by building in some redundancy of responsibility - content should work in less-than-perfect tools (that are available currently) and tools should handle less-than-perfect content (since most content is).  </s>
<s> Or we can design for an ideal world, and leave real people to fall through the gaps between implementation and specification (and that is before taking into account that specifications themselves are less-than-perfect).  </s>
<s> Ian Jacobs used to write about this - most notably in the W3C Recommendation User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - which I presume is familiar.  </s>
