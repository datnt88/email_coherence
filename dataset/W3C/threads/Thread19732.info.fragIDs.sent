Some bugs: 1. 
If the program tries to connect (using dial up networking) and you cancel, then the whole program is locked and the process has to be killed. 
2. The program always starts with the same window size and position. 
a) it should be able to store previous settings. 
b) it should not sit under the 'taskbar' at the bottom of the screen. 
3. The open files dialogue has '.html' and '.htm' files as separate filters. 
They should be in the same filter. 
It would also be useful to have some kind of history/recent list. 
4. Whenever amaya.exe is run it creates an 'amaya' sub-directory under the 'temp' directory, with 9 further sub-directories which are usually empty. 
a) the program should delete temporary files/directories if it really needs them. 
b) they should be created under the 'thot' or 'amaya' directory. 
5. The distribution contains both win95 and NT binaries. 
A lot of users will only want one, so there should be separate zip files for each (the binaries take up a lot of space). 
6. The program cannot handle spaces in filenames - this is Windows 95 not Unix! 
7. After a few uses, everything goes pear-shaped - it sometimes loads and does nothing - leaving a process running but nothing visible. 
The dialog boxes also go wrong (showing numbers instead of buttons on the scroll bars, wrong fonts etc.) etc. 8. Graphics are often not displayed properly, sometimes appearing as a black rectangle, or else not at all. 
9. It is very slow when displaying files.

The default window height is a little tall for a 1024x768 window under X, too. 
Actually, spaces are valid in Unix filenames too, so Amaya had better be able to handle them! 
This is tricky, because they have to be encoded as %20 when converting to a URL but changed back to spaces when used in filenames. 
And takes a remarkably long time to load under Windows 95 (Linux is fine).

Well, I just downloaded the 9/22 windows95 binary and unzipped it using pkunzip v2.04g to C:\ as suggested. 
I had to rename wwwstrea.dll 
to wwwstream.dll as pkunzip did not handle the long file name. 
However, 
when I then executed amaya.exe from the c:\thot\win95\bin directory the disk spun and then exited back to a command prompt. 
I then tried SET THOTDIR=C:\THOT with no change in action. 
Is there a specific set of environment variables that amaya needs to be happy? 
I got the impression from Xanni over the weekend that there was. 
Is there some test that I can perform to understand what amaya is trying to do. 
Just spinning the disk and exiting doesn't give me a clue. 
Is there some simple critical error handler that w3 might consider implementing to display a clue. 
Is there a specific setup I can use, perhaps some command line argument and a local .htm 
file?

You should download WinZip from www.winzip.com. 
Don't forget that if you change environment variables in a DOS window, it only affects the environment in that window. 
You need to set variables in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to change them globally (including within Windows).

Hi Charles, 
We unfortunatelly can do nothing to improve pkunzip. 
You do not need to set any environment variable. 
The environment variable HOME is not important for amaya/Windows. 
THOTDIR is set by amaya itself. 
All what you need is that the files listed below must be present in the right directory: Thot\amaya: HTML.STR MathML.STR HTMLT.TRA HTMLTT.TRA MathMLT.TRA HTML.trans MathML.trans MathML.SCH EDITOR.SCH HTML.SCH HTMLP.PRS HTMLPBW.PRS HTMLPLP.PRS HTMLPLPUS.PRS HTMLPP.PRS HTMLPPUS.PRS MathMLP.PRS HTML.conf HTML.EN HTML.FR Thot\win95\bin wwwdll.dll 
WWWUTILS.DLL 
WWWCORE.DLL WWWTRANS.DLL wwwcache.dll 
wwwstream.dll 
WWWMIME.DLL WWWHTTP.DLL wwwhtml.dll 
wwwnews.dll 
wwwdir.dll 
wwwgophe.dll 
wwwftp.dll 
wwwfile.dll 
wwwtelnt.dll 
WWWAPP.DLL wwwwais.dll 
msvc_40.dll 
Amaya.exe

If you prefer command lines you can also get unz520xN.exe 
zcr21xN.zip which are the GNU zip and unzip for win32. 
I'm not sure what the URLs are though.
