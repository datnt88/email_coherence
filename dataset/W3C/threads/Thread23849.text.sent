I want to get some technical help on FontMonger by Ares Software but can't find a WWW page for this company. 
Can anyone provide any direction for me or is someone very knowledgeable about this software who can answer a question themselves.

They were purchased by Adobe just last year... (smart move on Adobe's part:) Walter Ian Kaye boo_at_best*com Programmer - Excel, AppleScript, Mountain View, CA ProTERM, FoxPro, HTML Ares FontMonger Although a budget program, FontMonger allows basic outline editing, import and export of Type 1 and TrueType (and several other scalable formats). 
Its autohinting isn't awful either. 
Adobe, which now owns Ares, no longer promotes FontMonger but it is still avaiable from some computer stores. 
Runs on Windows 3.1 and above. 
You could try asking Adobe, depending on whether you assume "no longer promotes" is the same as "no longer supports".

(I already had Fontographer, so didn't pay much attention...) Walter Ian Kaye boo_at_best*com Programmer - Excel, AppleScript, Mountain View, CA ProTERM, FoxPro, HTML Anyone know if there is a PC shareware that can view all the font installed in the machine? 
So that you can compare which font to pick when using word, photoshop, etc. Thank you!

Similar to the way you got on it. 
send mail to www-font-request@w3.org with a Subject line saying unsubscribe Chris Lilley, W3C [ http://www.w3.org/ ] Graphics and Fonts Guy The World Wide Web Consortium chris@w3.org 
2004 Rt des Lucioles / BP 93 A little research on our wonderful Internet will show you all how to remove yourselves from the list you subscribed to without having to crowd the list traffic with unsubscribe requests. 
Notice that the name of the list is www-font@w3.org...perhaps if you examined the web site at www.w3.org it would jog your memory of when you subscribed to the list and you could find the instructions. 
Here's a hint...click on the "Fonts" button in the top right section.
