Hi! Does anyone have experience with Allaire's authoring and development tools with regard to accessibility issues? 
These include Cold Fusion and HomeSite. 
Any comments? 
Recommendations? 
Thanks!

Accessibility of the output or the developer interface? 
For the former, the output is as good as what the user inputs :). 
The fact that CFML is involved is generally transparent to the end user (aside from the .cfm 
file names seen on the web site).

I'm using ColdFusion 3.1.1 
to develop a simple database query application. 
The form is HTML with optional client-side JavaScript form validation. 
I'm not using any of ColdFusion's built-in forms generation. 
Version 3.1.1, 
at least, supports HTML 4.0 but has no accessibility-specific features. 
The HTML syntax checker built into CF Studio (the developer client) recognizes most of HTML 4.0. 
It complains about the ACCESSKEY attribute on a form SELECT tag, but that's the only problem I've encountered with it. 
I have no experience with HomeSite. 
Home Site is totally customizable. 
If something doesn't work the way you need, you likely can change it. 
HTML Validator, Tag completion, Color syntax-highlighting, etc are all customizable. 
Coding in Home Site is done by hand, and verified to be proper HTML using the built-in CSE 3310 HTML Validator, which you can easily modify. 
The UI is not too bad, although there could be some accessibility problems somewhere of which I am not aware. 
All toolbars are built using a XML-like 
language. 
There are stock toolbars, but, you can create your own. 
HomeSite has provisions for creating its toolbars, although it isn't quite as simple as one may want. 
It is good about providing redundant information via visual and aural warnings and errors. 
On an error or warning, it beeps, the status bar displays the exact error, and the status bar changes colors depending on severity of the coding error, and it shows an icon which characterizes the error to some extent. 
All of this is done real time; after you enter  it performs all of the coding checks. 
Of course, it has tag completion so you don't have to type as much. 
When you press , it 
drops down a list of all valid HTML tags and narrows the list as you type. 
Then when you press space after the tag it starts dropping down lists of valid attributes for that tag. 
All tags and attributes for each tag are stored in stock and/or custom DTDs, which you can modify quite easily. 
All of this applies to Cold Fusion support in HomeSite, also. 
I have never used Cold Fusion's editor, as I don't use Cold Fusion. 
But, HomeSite probably has a superset of the Cold Fusion editor's features. 
HomeSite provides color syntax-highlighting of most popular server and client scripting languages: PHP, CFML, ASP, JScript, VBScript, etc. Hope that gives you some info. 
I use HomeSite 4.0, and, used HomeSite 3.x for quite some time beforehand. 
They are both excellent, but, HomeSite 4 is by far the best yet.

Like most of the other folks, I have used Cold Fusion to drive websites. 
I don't use the development stuff supplied - I tried it once and didn't like it, but there is no reason why you can't create perfectly accessible CFML, although some of the components that it offers are only in inaccessible formats.
