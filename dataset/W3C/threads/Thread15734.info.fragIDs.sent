<s> You know, I never really thought of that much.  </s>
<s> I suppose that it could be a problem with most speech synthesizers.  </s>
<s> It is hard to say if that is a flaw with the synthesizer, the specs, or the writer.  </s>
<s> The little emoticons are almost a language of their own.  </s>
<s> It would be a shame to stop using them because of perceived accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> They often translate to something that words cannot describe in an adequately short space.  </s>
<s> :o could never be totally captured by words.  </s>
<s> Not to mention that almost anyone could understand ;) without translation.  </s>
<s> CSS2 could help tremendously.  </s>
<s> Controlling the prosody would be a useful thing.  </s>
<s> But, I am not sure that something wouldn't be lost if we gave up our emoticons completely.  </s>
<s> Emotional states for the voice would be a useful addition to CSS.  </s>
<s> I mean, do most people know which volume, pitch, stress, richness values would make a voice sound happy or sad?  </s>
<s> A high quality speech synthesizer, using the MBROLA algorithm for instance, could easily duplicate emotional inflections in its speech.  </s>
<s> Some of the rougher voices, like Peter, wouldn't benefit much.  </s>
<s> Here is something that surprised me the first time I heard it.  </s>
<s> My speech synthesizer speaks "Winking Smiley Face" when it encounters ;) and it speaks "Smiley Face" when it encounters :) There is other ASCII 'art' that it speaks.  </s>
<s> I have noticed these in common practice, though.  </s>
<s> I am using MS IE 5.0 b1 on Windows 98 with MS Voice 4.0 installed.  </s>
<s> I am using the 'Mike' True Voice speech engine that comes with Voice 4.0.  </s>
<s> I modified one of the example programs to read using the Accessibility hooks in Windows 98.  </s>
<s> It isn't as sophisticated as the commercial screen readers, but, it works much better for my needs.  </s>
<s> I dislike all of the other screen readers that I have tried.  </s>
<s> I can, at least, fix mine when it does something stupid ;)  </s>
<s> I will add that I am not visually impaired or blind.  </s>
<s> So, I have not had to rely on the screen reader.  </s>
<s> I have many friends that do rely on them, though.  </s>
<s> However, I have found that the screen reader helps me stay focused.  </s>
<s> I often get distracted while reading.  </s>
<s> I read about 1000 words per minute, but, I rarely make it through more than a few minutes before drifting off on a tangent.  </s>
<s> The screen reader and headphones seem to keep me focused on what I am doing.  </s>
<s> It only speaks clearly to about 200 WPM, so I trade a little speed for endurance.  </s>
<s> I am sure it helps comprehension a bit, also.  </s>

<s> Hi all... i have been trying to work around the 'smiley problem', ie, that ':)' means nothing for aural browsers... my current solution is to use a span class="smiley" *smile* /span (or *wink* or *pout* or whatever...) and the use a CSS stylesheet so the *smile* is printed out in red (or pronounced in a different peach, although I haven't tried aural stylesheets as I cannot yet check them) Booby approves my pages but on accessibility tips it comments about ASCII art...  </s>
<s> The only thing I can think of as ASCII art is the '*' surrounding the words... how much of a problem is "*grin*" for an aural UA? Would it be better just "smile" and making it to stand out of the main text via the stylesheet?  </s>
<s> Any help appreciated... (note: pages with this are, if you like to check, at really welcome...) Thanks, David@ sig who David Su&amp;aacute;rez de Lis uri mailto:phdavidl@usc.es from institution University of Santiago de Compostela  </s>

<s> Mmm... that is an idea... Using CSS2 and the @aural media, I guess we could make some kind of on-the-fly translator for the most usual ASCII art, so on visual environments they would see ' :) ' or whatever, and on aural UAs have a gigle, or a description of the emoticon... that would require CSS2 fully aware UAs, btw... Would such a thing be possible with CSS2?  </s>
<s> (haven't dug too much on the @aural possibilities yet...) i am thinking is something like: span.smiley@aural { ":)": Rose.read "Smiling face" } or span.gigle@aural { ":)": Rose.play "gigle.wav"  </s>
