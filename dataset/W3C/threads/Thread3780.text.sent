The debate has come to life on www-validator again! 
I'm posting the ParserMessages.msg 
I use for Page Valet here, and I'll post a pointer in the current thread on validator. 
Should we consider using these (or some further-modified version) for v.w.o? Nick Kew -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Well, we certainly need better messages; but I really don't want to use a patched version of OpenSP for the Validator if at all possible. 
My current plan (for 0.7) is to get the message numbers out of onsgmls and keep a completely separate catalog; either to replace its messages or to supplement them. 
Possibly also context sensitive so that references to specific elements will trigger appropriate explanations.

:) Nick, aren't your changes (or a subset of them) acceptable upstream in OpenSP?

It's not really a serious issue for packaging; the different sets of messages are completely interchangable as far as building and running a working installation are concerned. 
I haven't asked there. 
The basic issue is that some of the changes are pretty specific to the validation task, and would probably not be appropriate to other OpenSP applications. 
For example, it replaces a warning about NET-enabling start tag with (from memory) "Stray slash found in start tag: are you confusing SGML and XML (or HTML and XHTML) syntax?" 
Do you think I should post a diff to openjade-devel with a pointer to this thread, and ask for opinions? 
Nick Kew Ok, but there's stuff like http://validator.w3.org:8001/docs/errors.html 
... That's what I'd do. 
It's a win-win situation for everyone in the end if even some of the changes are considered improvements to OpenSP and get applied there.
