I have questions about retrieving and posting replies, neither of which are currently documented on the Protocols page 
It looks as though I can retrieve a reply thread for an annotation by doing GET /annot?w3c_replyTree=annotationURL 
The RDF returns has resources of type Is posting a reply like posting an annotation, but using t:Reply and all of the other thread properties?

Let me be less vague here. 
(When I started writing the last email I thought I had some example RDF to hand, but couldn't find it in the end.) When I GET with ?w3c_replyTree=annotationURL for an annotatoin with replies, I get something like Most of this is fairly clear I think (except maybe the atr:attribution). 
So my question is, what message do I need to send to create a new reply to an annotation? 
Is it a POST to the annotation server with ... similar to Figure 2 on the Protocols page?

Hello Matthew, Thanks for your remarks. 
We had completely forgotten to update the protocol page. 
I promise to do it early next week to add the reply queries. 
Your feedback will be as always welcome. 
It was never our intention to hide this info or force people to reverse engineer the applictation to find it. 
Sorry about it. 
I'll answer your mail more thoroughly next week, after finishing the update. 
Have a good weekend, -jose
