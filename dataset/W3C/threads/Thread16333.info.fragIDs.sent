<s> Hi, Len I believe that dynamically generated pages could better handle pages  </s>
<s> where a left column contains links and reference information and a column to the right of that contains text.  </s>
<s> The screen readers which can  </s>
<s> read a column at a time will read all that stuff in the left column first.  </s>
<s> Then it reads the column with the text and then the right column which probably has more links.  </s>
<s> This reading order is not most optimal for blind users.  </s>
<s> Decorative images can be left out since they can be distracting to blind users with little useful information.  </s>
<s> Informational images might be better handled by having alert boxes which have a long description which  </s>
<s> can be accessed on demand.  </s>
<s> Or, having a section towards the end with  </s>
<s> the various image descriptions.  </s>
<s> If the page is from a catalog where description is important, the dynamically generated web page could have a detailed description of the coat  </s>
<s> instead of an image on pages for sighted people.  </s>
<s> The description should be integrated into the text flow for easier reading.  </s>
<s> Sighted users tend to not like text compressed together.  </s>
<s> More whitespace is preferred.  </s>
<s> Blind often like more compressed text on the screen since they have to interact with their screen reader less (depending on the screen reader).  </s>
<s> I've had requests to use smaller fonts since that puts more text in the window.  </s>
<s> My impression is that the fewer of these "speed bumps" which cause distraction in reading, the easier it is for blind users.  </s>
<s> It might be helpful to try some experiments.  </s>

<s> Hi Scott, You talk at the end of your note about the potential benefit of dynamically generating different versions of pages.  </s>
<s> Of the examples you gave the one where the benefit is most obvious is the radio button vs. drop down list.  </s>
<s> Radio buttons are more convenient in many situations for sighted people (especially when there are a lot of ratings arranged table fashion) but in a previous discussion on this list blind users pointed out the advantages of dropdown lists while screenreading.  </s>
<s> And this isn't just a hypothetical situation: I'm facing this exact situation right now while advising some folks how to make an online survey.  </s>
<s> In the other examples though, you described solutions that didn't require dynamic generation.  </s>
<s> Could you give additional examples in which the advantages of different forms is more obvious?  </s>
<s> For example, a case where text is laid out in a table, and is understandable when linearized, but could be read more conveniently if not linearized?  </s>
<s> By the way, reading order is one situation where style sheet layout could do the same thing as dynamic generation.  </s>
<s> To bad we can't count on that in visual browsers at the moment.  </s>
<s> Len  </s>
<s> Hi Len, I was wondering what effect placing a null value in the alt tag.  </s>
<s> Doesn't this result in the same problem as having no alt tags at all, in that the  </s>
<s> user will be prevented from finding out the reason for the image?  </s>
<s> I would  </s>
<s> assume that in most cases the image has some meaning, and therefore would  </s>
<s> benefit the user if they could have a description of it.  </s>
<s> I don't doubt that on a very busy interface there might be call to reduce  </s>
<s> the amount of text (although perhaps the page is overloaded anyway?) , but  </s>
<s> such decisions should be made with a lot of caution, and only when there's  </s>
<s> no other way to simplify the page.  </s>
<s> Otherwise,it might wrongly encourage designers to use null values on images that would enhance the page.  </s>
<s> Gareth Parkinson  </s>
<s> Hi Scott, Thank for the extra example.  </s>
<s> I just want to check one thing to preempt any misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> Even though you offer a page with alternate layout and other changes to make browsing more efficient with screenreaders, you still make the default page "accessible" in the conventional sense, right?  </s>
<s> For example, the default page would still satisfy the web accessibility guidelines... alt text, table reading order, etc.  </s>
<s> It's just that the alternate page would be more efficient to use.  </s>
<s> As for the details... 1.  </s>
<s> It does seem useful to have an alternate layout where the section of links and references come at the end instead of the beginning.  </s>
<s> It might also be useful to have a link at the start of the page to jump to that  </s>
<s> section  </s>
<s> 2. You speak of leaving out decorative images, but why not accomplish that by simply having null alt text?  </s>
<s> A ha.  </s>
<s> The difference between null and missing ALT text is the real life behaviors of  </s>
<s> browsers.  </s>
<s> In somecases, MISSING alt text is PREFERABLE to null alt text!  </s>
<s> From the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (now in "last call" status) at  </s>
<s> URL: Q 2.8 When alternative text has been specified explicitly as empty (i.e., an  </s>
<s> empty string), render nothing.  </s>
<s> /Q This is how Lynx currently behaves, but not pwWebSpeak.  </s>
<s> The guidelines say  </s>
<s> nothing about what to do about missing alt (and invalid html, of which would  </s>
<s> be one example.  </s>
<s> Lynx (and the big two with image loading off) generate something like [IMAGE].  </s>
<s> This is different behavior than ALT=" " or ALT="nbsp;".  </s>
<s> The bigger problem is when an image is a link.  </s>
<s> With Lynx, each  </s>
<s> link normally gets a number, so the following snippets of code are shown next  </s>
<s> to the default rendering with Lynx: A HREF="foobar.html" IMG SRC="foobar.gif" /A [1][LINK] A HREF="foobar.html" IMG SRC="foobar.gif" ALT="Foobar" /A [2]Foobar A HREF="foobar.html" IMG SRC="foobar.gif" ALT=" " /A [3] Notice that the last example generates nothing!  </s>
<s> If "hidden" links are the ONLY  </s>
<s> links on a page, Lynx generates a warning, but otherwise these hidden links are  </s>
<s> effectively invisible.  </s>
<s> (One can list all links on a page, or look at the source code, but these are extreme time consuming measures.)  </s>
<s> We have been over this before, and many have made the arguement that ALT="" is  </s>
<s> frequently appropriate.  </s>
<s> I agree that it should be valid html, but I think this  </s>
<s> is a point where the WCAG could make a clear unabigious distinction.  </s>
<s> The problem with ALT="" is that it is ambiguous.  </s>
<s> You don't know WHY the author  </s>
<s> put that in there.  </s>
<s> Is he just trying to get his code validated?  </s>
<s> Is this REALLY just a decorative, content-free graphic?  </s>
<s> Does he have something against  </s>
<s> text-based browsers?  </s>
<s> Is this some kind of spacer image?  </s>
<s> Did he just forget?  </s>
<s> IMHO, ALT="" is NEVER prefereable to other choices.  </s>
<s> For decorative graphics, use a single non-alphanumeric character.  </s>
<s> There is  </s>
<s> ALWAYS a punctuation mark that is closer in meaning (closer than nothing anyway) to a "content free" image.  </s>
<s> The burden of repeated links (one big arguement for using ALT="" within A HREF  </s>
<s> ... /A ) is much less of a problem than the chance of missing content and links!  </s>
