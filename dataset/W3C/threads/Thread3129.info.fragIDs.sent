So shall we go with this: for SKOS-Core 1.0. 
Al. 
Do you want multiple namespaces? 
then maybe (contents of http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/2003/11/21-skos-core) (contents of http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/2003/11/21-skos-mapping) 
others? 
dan, did you say http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/ was available for us? 
That's outside the swad europe area, so we'll need permission to write there.

Yes, that seems a little better (in practice is means we have this stuff in a subdirectory...) Dan
