More reports from the March 8 and 12 meetings. 
Attendence was confusing: every member of the ERB was in attendence in part, but there was a certain amount of checking in and out based on travel plans and interruptions; my notes record no dissenting votes to any of the following, but some member who missed a particular vote may choose to record a dissent: 1. 
The XML-LINK attribute will get a new declared value. 
So far, we have (LINK|XLINK), which inconveniently doesn't provide a this-ain't-no- steenking-link value to override a defaulted value from the subset. 
So we'll change it to (LINK|XLINK|FALSE). 
2. We discussed the idea of having a way to provide a base address; the LOCATION-SOURCE and IMPLIED-LOCATION-SOURCE stuff in the initial draft. 
The ERB is powerfully in favor of giving entities a way to specify the canonical address by which they'd like to be referred to, bookmarked, relative address computed, etc. 
But we realize this is really not XML-LINK stuff, just a very convenient convenience feature for the XML language itself. 
So we provisionally decided (provisionally because this hasn't had WG exposure) to create a new per-entity ?XML-BASE 
PI and write that into the language spec. 
We could not, at this time, muster support for the IMPLIED-LOCATION-SOURCE stuff. 
3. We took up the questions of what subset of TEI Xpointers we're going to need. 
We developed consensus that: - the subset in the initial spec is reasonable, except that - even though SPAN is really useful, we are nervous that as far as we know, the world has only one implementation, namely Panorama; are there others?, and - sub-element addressing (TOKEN, character counting, patterns) are just not stable enough, particularly in the case of some Asian languages, to be worthwhile including in XML-Link release 1.0. 
4. We decided that we were not going to specify support for any query language, built-in or FOREIGN, in XML-Link 1.0, beyond TEI Xpointers, which are in fact a query language. 
Support in some way for SDQL remains firmly on the agenda, but not in this release. 
5. On the subject of Extended Link Groups, the ERB is unanimous that we must have some way of providing this function - of pointing to other documents that contain links into a current one. 
However, there is another standardization effort underway in the W3C called Web Collections that may well be, in parallel, cooking up a solution to this same problem. 
Furthermore, the rumor mill says that the idea of using XML for Web Collections is in play. 
We have an action item to check this out - if we can outsource this job to existing web machinery, it would clearly be a good thing. 
6. 
We discussed whether or not we should specify a process model, i.e. assert that a locator containing a '#' should be split in two, the part before the '#' being handled by the server to retrieve a resource, the part after being used by the client to track down a more specific resource within the retrieved one. 
This is universal Web behavior. 
We decided not to specify this, and leave it to the implementors; clearly we can think of cases (humungous SGML docs) where we'd like the server to help out with the after-the-# part; while it's hard to see how that could happen in the current Web architecture, we are reluctant to rule it out.

+1-604-708-9592 Is this the work sitting behind a passworded web site and available only to dues-paying members of the W3C? 
If so, how does that fit into a spec being developed by this Working Group which includes consortium and non-consortium members? 
len bullard Well, I when I go to look at "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Submission/1997/2/Overview.html", the site certainly behves like it's passworded and not available to non-consortium members. 
On the other hand, the abstract that I can read says: "The submission may be distributed publicly free of any fee." So... Good point. 
Microsoft has to be a bit careful, because this is a *formal* proposal from that corporation to an industry consortium of which they're a member - they have to play by the rules, which I think say that proposals are initially available only to members. 
On the other hand, I think that MS would agree that it would be a good thing to make this available to us - I'll ask around. 
On the other hand, we just create XML, we cannot, nor should we want to, control what people do with it. 
The playwright has no normative influence over the director.

+1-604-708-9592 Yes, but the playwright sits in on rehearsals and is consulted for changes in the script. 
Union rules. 
We can't adopt or count on what we can't see. 
If those are the consortium rules, we are definitely building this under the wrong aegis. 
Hitching a ride is one thing; walking behind the horse without watching where one steps is another. 
len Tim Bray: Web Collections is supposed to be part of the IETF WEBDAV spec, too. 
Discussion is ongoing on that list about the document (which Yaron Goland says he's going to revise to meet criticisms). 
There must be a public copy somewhere.

len We thought that it would be handy to be able to provide multiple base locations, which you'd be able to do if you repeated the PI. 
My preference, which you all must be tired of hearing about at this point :-), would be syntax like this (a fake GI along with the attribute structure): Eve TOKEN and FOREIGN seemed the obvious ways to solve some of my problems. 
I'm happy to accept the ERB's conclusion, but will require some method of searching through a node once it has been reached by a TEI pointer. 
Is this completely application-specific, or is there a way (FOREIGN not being allowed) to apply (say) a Java method to the node contents? 
It could be worthwhile to converge towards a standard syntax, because this will be a common requirement and general XML applications/browsers will need to recognise it.
