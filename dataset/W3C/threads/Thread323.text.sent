Hi, I've noticed what may be a little bug in HTMLTidy. 
That when it inserts it's own "meta" tag saying the page was generated by HTMLTidy, it puts it as the first element in the head, before the "title" tag. 
Now I'm sure I've read in the standard that the "title" tag must be the first element in the "head" tag, but when I read back through the standards (HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0) I could not find such a rule. 
If I'm right, then HTMLTidy should put the "title" tag first. 
If I'm wrong, then I'm losing my mind and seeing things! 
Best Regards, Nick Read Hobart, Australia Nick Read: There is no such rule. 
You've read it somewhere. 
There are lots of sites citing this non-existent rule. 
You're mind is OK, but theirs are not. 
Bertilo Wennergren There is no such rule. 
I'm glad someone with some confident knowledge said that. 
:-) I too read the same rule (and even printed it) from fairly reputable sources but when I went looking in the specs myself, I found not a trace of that rule. 
Makes sense. 
Sounds too arbitrary!
