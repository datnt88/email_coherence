<s> Some time ago I registered online for the Web Accessibility Evaluation Exchange being held in Dublin this week, organised by WAI, Microsoft and the CRC.  </s>
<s> The event is tomorrow at Dublin University and I've heard nothing  </s>
<s> back.  </s>
<s> I'm loathe to go to Dublin to find that I'm not registered or there is some other difficulty.  </s>
<s> There is no contact on the event section of the site to confirm or discuss.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have a contact ?  </s>

<s> There's a phone number on the page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/0904-eval.html .  </s>
<s> The number is for people who need help getting accessible transport, but they might be able to point you in the right direction.  </s>
<s> On the subject of transport don't call it "Dublin University" when you get into a taxi, we have three.  </s>
<s> A taxi driver would be more likely to bring you to TCD (the one the tourists always want to see) than to UCD (the one you want to go to).  </s>
<s> should be sorted now.  </s>
