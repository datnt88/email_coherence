Hi All, At ephen_rylander/Persist.aspx under my large font settings I have to scroll to the right to see text which makes reading the thing very slow and awkward. 
The main body of text is contained in a TD tag so I specified 50% in my stylesheet but it had no effect. 
I changed it to just 500 (for a laugh really) and to my surprise it worked and the text displays in a more narrow column which I don't need to scroll. 
So my question is why didn't the 50% work? 
What is it 50% of? 
Is that the point? 
I just don't like using fixed values.

Which browser and version? 
What platform? 
It still jars when people write "tag" and mean "element". 
This is invalid CSS, although I believe that "px" is commonly interpolated by browsers. 
IE 5.5 tables (Win 32) seem to have some non-intuitve behaviour for percentages. 
I had to style a table element with "font-size: 100%" to get the expected behaviour of using the size given on the body element. 
This might be an absolute size for table elements in the browser's virtual style sheet, but might be an actual non-compliance. 
The percentage of TD is, I believe, of the TR. 
Most likely seems a browser bug - there are problems with CSS and tables in many old browsers.
