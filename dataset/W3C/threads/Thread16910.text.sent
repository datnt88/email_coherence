Hi, I'm just finishing up a project where we checked web page accessibility for blind users by phone. 
Basically, each blind subject was on a conference call with the testers. 
There were a couple of benefits to this approach. 
It reduced the amount of set up time because the blind subject was able to work with his/her standard accessibility configuration. 
Another benefit was that it significantly reduced testing costs like travel while increasing the number of testers. 
I've been asked to take our notes and produce a document describing the approach taken so it can be used in some other projects. 
I was thinking it might be good to include any testing approaches that other people may have taken. 
So far the only significant description of testing web pages by blind subjects seems to be the one written by the Norman-Nielsen group. 
If you know of any other or have your own approach, I would very much appreciate hearing about them. 
Thanks, Scott Hi, The issue of "getting it right" is an interesting one, but it is not clear exactly what it means since various people and organizations have different interpretations. 
With regards to web page accessibility, I contacted hisoftware and found out their software doesn't address a number of the issues of "understanding". 
When we were doing some web page testing, some of the questions that blind people were asked were like: 1. 
What is the purpose of the web page being presented? 
2. How do you know you are correctly interpreting the purpose of the web page? 
3. How long did it take you to correctly understand the purpose of the web page? 
4. What on the web page is confusing to you? 5. What on the web page did you use incorrectly? 
Scott I just run the hisoftware tools because it is more important to get it right than to know who and how can and they use it. 
Just to add a few more comments (or possibly re-add the same comments ...): Who decides what the "real" purpose of the page is? 
If the designer is on hand (or if you designed a test page), then you have a good chance of being sure what the page is for. 
But this still may not agree with what most users think the page is for, or ought to be for. 
Some pages have one specific purpose, &amp; should have as little distracting material as possible (a purchase completion page). 
Other pages (a university or supermarket homepage) may need to offer something to a wide range of users with different interests. 
So it may be better to frame the questions in terms of user expectations, esp. 
since few people will ever be presented with a web page out of thin air. 
They are either typing in an address, following a link recommended by a friend, or following a link from a previous web page. 
In all these cases the user has some expectation of what will happen when the new page loads. 
So the question might be: What were you expecting to find on the page? 
Were you able to find it? 
What unexpected things occurred? 
Did they distract or help you in finding what you wanted? 
You might also compare the confusion level of the novice blind user with the confusion level of a novice sighted user. 
(My hunch is that there won't be very many "intuitively obvious" pages without some level of training/experience.) Another area that studies, particularly of blind users tend not to address is the learning curve issue. 
It may take even an experienced blind web user a long time to understand a new site, esp. 
if it uses unfamiliar navigation or other layout features. 
But after the structure of the page is learned, return visits can go much faster. 
So if I know that the link I want is the third one that starts with R, I simply load the page, use the Link List command, type R R R &amp; hit Enter (for example purposes only). 
So I may actually get to the desired content faster than a darkness-impaired user in some cases. 
This is where things like frames become issues. 
Blind users (&amp; many others with &amp; without disabilities) work best in familiar navigational structures. 
When the metaphor for the page design changes (it's a Windows dialog box; it's like a spreadsheet for you to fill in numbers), or new elements are added (pop-out menus, etc), these are confusing until learned. 
So, if a user has to continually learn new page metaphors, his/her efficiency will be decreased. 
(Of course many web authors are constantly seeking new page designs to differentiate themselves from the competition, so this will always be an issue.) My rambling shall cease, Patrick
