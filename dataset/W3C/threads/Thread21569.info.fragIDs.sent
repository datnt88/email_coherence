application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-external-parsed-entity content, so I guess application/rdf+xml is in the clear.

But RFC3023 says that "Fragment identification" is part of the 'generic' processing implied by foo+xml. 
--- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt 
--- 7. A Naming Convention for XML-Based Media Types This document recommends the use of a naming convention (a suffix of '+xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types, whatever their particular content may represent. 
This allows the use of generic XML processors and technologies on a wide variety of different XML document types at a minimum cost, using existing frameworks for media type registration. 
Some areas where 'generic' processing is useful include: o Fragment identification - XPointers (work in progress) can work with any XML document, whatever vocabulary it uses and whether or not it uses XPointer for its own fragment identification.

I'm not sure you are -- that conflict looks unpleasant. 
The XPointer people need to clarify that: do XPointer semantics apply to all application/FOO+xml media types (as your text suggests), or only those who say it does in their definition. 
And if the latter, as the suggest, what's going on between W3C and IETF on this? 
Can you do an official comment on it? 
So when are you going to hatch into a louse? 
I'm not sure I want to be around for that!
