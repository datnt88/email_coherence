<s> On the Amaya list there is some traffic about why that "test bed" hasn't been ported to Macs, like: "More web pages are created on a Macintosh than any other platform.  </s>
<s> According to WebWEEK, the weekly trade journal for Internet Professionals, Macintosh is again the #1 platform for professional World Wide Web authoring."  </s>
<s> Have we been (are being?) blind (pun intneded) to this because it might account for a large area of the biggest problem - the Web design attitude that holds appearance to transcend in importance the "content"?  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> It's people, not machines.  </s>
<s> Macintoshes are not responsible for inaccessible web design any more than PageMaker is responsible for poorly-designed publications.  </s>
<s> It's all about educating web authors, regardless of their tools, and that means we need guidelines that are clear and understandable.  </s>
<s> The new guidelines _are_ an improvement, thank you, WAI.  </s>
<s> Keep at it.  </s>
<s> And I won't jump onto my 25-year-old soapbox about graphic designers who fall in love with their design at the expense of the information they are supposed to deliver.  </s>

<s> The wide usage of Mac's for web authoring is just a consequence of the fact that the web is so young that most people who write for the web come from other other professions, namly desktop publishing and advertising.  </s>
<s> In a few years web authoring will become a profession of its own, and with people who started their professional career in the Web age.  </s>
<s> Since the web is inherently operating system independent, the operating systems used by web authors will be more or less the same as of the general public.  </s>
