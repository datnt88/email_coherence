Here is 8.1: Allow the user to navigate views (notably those with frame viewports). 
I don't know what this means. 
The view menus of IE, Opera and Netscape don't offer any guidance. 
The terminology needs refining. 
Not only do I not know what a view is, neither do I know what one is with a frame viewport. 
But then again, I don't know what a frame viewport is. 
That all makes me pretty stupid, I recogonize, which is no surprise to me. 
But I put myself at the high end on probablity of understanding one of these checkpoints. 
This is probably just a wording problem. 
Please help with different words. 
Jim Thatcher IBM Special Needs Systems www.ibm.com/sns thatch@us.ibm.com (512)838-0432 Linking these words to the definitions would be helpful. 
In addition, there are some helpful things that could be mentioned in the techniques. 
For example, Opera does allow the user to navigate between views - in it's case various windows, as does emacs-w3. 
Other systems rely on the Operating System to do it - in MSWindows and the X window system there are keyboard and mouse driven methods for moving among open windows.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Jim, There is a definition of views in Appendix A of the guidelines document which should help clarify the meaning of views. 
It maybe useful to have a link on the key word "view" to the definition. 
I will check with Ian on the possibility of doing that. 
Thanks again for your comments, they are very important for getting this document into a usable shape.

I get the impression that you guys have been working so long on these checkpoints without others interacting that when someone comes in and says, what does that mean, you think, wow, she must be out in left field. 
Yes I am fully aware that the techniques document is not ready. 
But, darn it, we are on the same side, so to speak, I know assistive technology, and I know the web. 
The responses I have gotten have been like pontification. 
Quote This is the way it is Endquote. 
On the subject checkpoint, the wording is not consistent with the glossary. 
I believe that quote frame viewports endquote does not make sense. 
And the checkpoint should not require reference to a glossary. 
If this is important, if should stand on its own. 
That is true for other checkpoints I have asked about. 
I believe that if I can't understand the points being made, then it is a problem with the wording of the points. 
If I can't evaluate an agent against the checkpoints/guidelines then there is a problem with the checkpoints. 
Thanks for thanking me for the comments!

You mean other people are meant to read this document??? 
I'm all ears! 
I think we can rely on the glossary and may have to. 
Not all terms are used the same way, and having a definition that's internally consistent is important and perhaps the only way to ensure that the document as a whole stands up. 
Internal inconstency is a bad thing, however. 
I agree! 
I haven't had a chance to review all of your comments yet, but I will soon. 
- Ian It is always a danger when working on something clsely that you forget how people see it on first meeting. 
But I think that we have made certain assumptions. 
One of them is that there are a few terms we want to define so we can use them, and view is probably one of them. 
Whether we can do that better is of course an open question. 
I think in the specific checkpoint what we want to do is allow navigation between views and/or viewports (such as frames or multiple windows). 
Charles McCN (probably the greatest offender in the Pontificating stakes, for which I'm sorry) I agree. 
I've fixed this. 
I went through the whole spec and tried to ensure consistency. 
There may still be bugs and I hope you will find them and point them out. 
I almost agree. 
However, there are some terms that are used differently in different contexts or by different communities, including words like "element", which may have a technical meaning (e.g., SGML) and common parlance meaning (component). 
We need a glossary to ensure that readers understand what we mean. 
Internal consistency is crucial and I hope you will point out inconsistencies you find. 
I am all for the clearest language possible (and to avoid jargon where we can). 
If you can propose other language you feel is clearer, please don't hesitate. 
Just an historical note: "viewport" comes from the CSS2 specification [1]: 9.1.1 
The viewport User agents for continuous media generally offer users a viewport (a window or other viewing area on the screen) through which users consult a document. 
User agents may change the document's layout when the viewport is resized (see the initial containing block). 
When the viewport is smaller than the document's initial containing block, the user agent should offer a scrolling mechanism. 
There is at most one viewport per canvas, but user agents may render to more than one canvas (i.e., provide different views of the same document).
