Folks, Last night as hubby was playing "flick a channel" on the tv, I caught an ad by Microsoft, advertising a speech reader designed for learning diabled folks. 
Has anyone else heard anything about this? 
Is it usable? 
Does it work with Explorer?

Enabling Support Foundation My understanding is that rather than a speech reader, the product in the ad was the Encarta encyclopedia with the read text option turned on.

Enabling Support Foundation Ah, well, I did think it was too good to be true. 
Truly wish MS would make a really good text to speech software, include it the next version of Windows and make it easy for anyone to use it who wants when they want.
