I am using egcs-1.1.2, glibc-2.1.1, and mostly current libs. 
I get this error along with many more similar: make[3]: Entering directory `/usr/src/Amaya/obj/thotlib' gcc -O2 -W -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I../../tablelib/f -I../../thotlib/include -I../../thotlib/internals/var -I../../thotlib/internals/h -I../../thotlib/internals/f -I../../schemas -I../../schemasOPERA -I../../libjpeg -I../../libpng -I../../libpng/zlib -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/X11R6/include -c ../../thotlib/unicode/ustring.c -o unicode/ustring.o

Any help would be appreciated.

The gcc optimizer on Linux Redhat 6 cannot compile the Amaya code. 
The current solution is to remove the -O2 flag. 
We're looking at that problem to find out a better solution. 
Regards Irene. 
The problem was found an a patch to Amaya sources was reported previously Something changed in the configure steup leading not to produce HAVE_MEMCPY in config.h 
(while it is indeed available on RH6), check the patch !
