Secondly, I agree that there are a number of places where the marshaling is underspecified with respect to (usually) error conditions (though in this case it is a 200 OK response). 
For example, in REPORT "the response body MUST contain the requested report" and "The DAV:version-tree REPORT response body MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML element." 
I didn't quite follow your point here Tim ... could you restate or clarify? 
Simply that when, say DAV:version-tree REPORT is in error, it returns an extended status element body (contrary to "The DAV:version-tree REPORT response body MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML element.")

OK, I think I get it. 
These statements should be qualified by "if the request succeeds". 
Will this address your concern?

I really wasn't that concerned g , I was acknowledging Juergen/James' comments -- but yes, that would fix it.

Ok, I'll make that fix. 
It's really bad to have false statements in the protocol, even if there is a reasonable interpretation very confusing to another. 
I'll make this change to every marshalling section.
