<s> Let's see how to pose this question.  </s>
<s> A company wants to convert Powerpoint slides as web content.  </s>
<s> They are planning on using the U of Illinois web export wizard that converts the Powerpoint slides to HTML (the wizard also produces associated CCS).  </s>
<s> Upon basic review it is noticed that the converted files render well in all the major Windows-based browsers and are screen readable.  </s>
<s> However, on a Macintosh running OS-X, using the latest Internet Explorer, the pages did not render nor did they render in Apple's Safari browser.  </s>
<s> However, the same files did render in Netscape, OmniWeb, Mozilla and iCab (all Mac browsers).  </s>
<s> Here's the question...a pretty good conversion tool in the making (some problems but a good start) but not all browsers support it's final output.  </s>
<s> I am going to leave the question open-ended and only ask, how would those of you in the group deal with this issue?  </s>
<s> A few more questions follow: Would you point people toward a browser that will work?  </s>
<s> Would you save the Powerpoint document as Rich Text/Outline as well as actual Powerpoint presentation and let folks download the two?  </s>
<s> Would you re-do the Powerpoint slides in HTML from scratch?  </s>
<s> Would you say, the majority of screen reader users use Windows so who cares about Mac users?  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'd like to hear some thoughts.  </s>
