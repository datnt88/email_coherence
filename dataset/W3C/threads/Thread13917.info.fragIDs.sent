<s> Dear ERT WG Participants: Please review the following draft charter for the ERT WG, and comment to the list as requested below.  </s>
<s> Note that due to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section is now required.  </s>
<s> Also, the charter is written with the possibility, but not the assurance, that EARL 1.0 would be Recommendation-track. If the group thinks that this is not a likely option, we could remove these references in the draft charter; if Rec-track work became more of an option once the group was underway, the group could then request an amended charter.  </s>
<s> The draft is available at: 1. Okay as is  </s>
<s> 2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)  </s>

<s> Nice to see that the ER group is getting started again.  </s>
<s> I agree with everything execpt that the AERT should not be part of the deliverables.  </s>
<s> The standard set of accessibility checks [1] are a better way of describing the same thing and should be used instead.  </s>
<s> These could be made part of the ER group.  </s>
<s> We should also increase the scope of the group to help coordinate the world wide development of ER tools and to promote the sharing of information.  </s>
<s> A deliverable would be to create a list of all ER tools worldwide.  </s>
<s> Putting EARL on the recommendation track is a good thing and we can easily fix the few problems it has within the timeline in the charter.  </s>

<s> This requires a different mindset on the part of the participants as well  </s>
<s> as different sorts of participants - more programmers, less essayists.  </s>
<s> Originally EARL was proposed by the late/lamented Len Kasday to make it possible for Web authors to make claims about what features concerning accessibility were contained in their efforts and nothing much has been done since.  </s>
<s> It's not a trivial undertaking but is probably necessary so that there is at least a semblance of objectivity of providing accessibility and device independence by using a utility that assists in the Web entity creation process.  </s>
<s> This is easier said than done, but I think we need to try with that outcome in mind.  </s>

<s> My 2 shekel...  </s>
<s> The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG) is to develop techniques and resources - this is a great mission, the scoop is more practical but less great... Perhaps we could brainstorm as to what is needed to fulfill this mission, before we bend to practical considerations.. Will idea: a w3c wcag validate My dream: a place to develop techniques for WCAG (Wcag documents but does not develop techniques) specifically today I think we need a forum to develop an ontology for WCAG repair.  </s>
<s> We have SWAP.  </s>
<s> And the work of the WAACI, but lets see what missing and what can be done.  </s>
<s> That would then feed into the RDF techniques document.  </s>
<s> By the way, Something that I am yet to find in any WAI charter is a place to define the problem, and brainstorm and design a solution.  </s>
<s> IE A place to fully document, specify and research what are the access related problems for as many user profiles as possible.  </s>
<s> A place to fully document and research how people with disabilities access the web content.  </s>
<s> Including: What design techniques can potential help, and what design techniques can potential hinder different groups.  </s>
<s> PF (or someone) could then develop strategies to ensure mark up can support solutions, and from there WCAG could effectively do it's job of creating guidelines.  </s>
<s> All the best Lisa Seeman  </s>
<s> We've been working to a software program that does just that: It is open source and runs on an Apache Tomcat server.  </s>
<s> It uses an open standard of accessibility checks and tests for WCAG 1, WCAG 2, 508, German BITV and more.  </s>
<s> Is this what you were thinking of?  </s>

<s> clarify a little more what you mean,  </s>
<s> It seems to be the same part of it that has been played by Josh Krieger's Bobby and Len Kasday's WAVE, etc.  </s>
<s> Of course, it doesn't "repair" or make indexed claims (such as metadata concerning accessibility features/levels) - and without an interactive-with-"author" component such programs never will.  </s>
<s> My point centers on doing this in a consortial setting so that the people who do these things with stuff that is likely to get widespread inclusion in widely-used products are able to suffer/benefit from wide input that is without the biases of commerce/academia/author-ego.  </s>
<s> Although I am still partly of the opinion that much good stuff in this vein gets done by (mostly) individuals working (mostly) alone, such as Josh, Len, Dave Raggett have demonstrated, there is a part of me that still hopes for a form of collaboration that can actually produce something that will attack this in other ways than merely writing lists of guidelines/checkpoints/criteria/techniques/examples.  </s>
<s> The latter process should be of little interest in my opinion.  </s>

<s> Hello to everybody.  </s>
<s> I'd like to contribute with my view of what AERT might be focussing on.  </s>
<s> This is more an open discussion rather than specific points to be made to the charter proposal.  </s>
<s> My apologies for this generality.  </s>
<s> I think we need to establish some sort of consensus on a long-term vision of what the group is about, and then define some of the steps (and hence deliverables) that should be produced in the short-term to achieve progress along those lines.  </s>
<s> As for the long-term vision, what is the service that AERT WG is going to offer and to whom?  </s>
<s> EARL is not directly an answer, as it is a means to achieve something: better interoperability between tools, so that end-users, tool manufacturers, possible purchasers, consumer associations, etc could be able to compare tools and could be able to compare/integrate different evaluations on certain websites.  </s>
<s> To achieve this we need tools that can incorporate EARL report, process them, and produce interesting and useful results, not simply tools that can only generate EARL reports.  </s>
<s> I think the AERT WG should keep constantly under the radar how EARL is or might be used, and do what can be done to promote its usage.  </s>
<s> One idea that was discussed sometime ago was to develop a service that would be able to upload EARL reports produced by several tools and offer to the user a sort of integration and comparison of results.  </s>
<s> The service could then be used by the public just like the HTML or CSS validators are used now.  </s>
<s> I would consider this a great success of AERT WG. Secondly, I would not like AERT WG to focus on technical aspects of what techniques AER tools should/could employ to evaluate websites.  </s>
<s> Let the developers do this.  </s>
<s> Why not concentrating on understanding how to measure the effectiveness, usability, quality of use, accessibility of tools?  </s>
<s> Development of an appropriate methodology could lead to (i) valid and useful comparisons between tools, (ii) and corresponding labeling (in terms of strength and weaknesses) of evaluations performed by the tools (perhaps evaluations could also be compared if available in EARL).  </s>
<s> The service AERT WG would provide in this case is again towards end-users, purchasers, tools manufacturers, etc in terms of a well-studied and robust tool evaluation methodology, that would be able to appropiately classify tools and results produced by tools.  </s>
<s> If appropriate, AERT WG could also run evaluations of tools according to such a methodology, and "sell" these results.  </s>
<s> A first draft of an example of methodology is described in Best regards to all of you Giorgio Brajnik Dip.  </s>
