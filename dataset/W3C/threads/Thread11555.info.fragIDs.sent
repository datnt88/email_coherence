Translator must translate and must not try to improve the source text. 
They should point out the errors, terminological aspects, and other suggestions to the author. 
The author should take note: create an errata document, improve future versions, etc. 
Having aligned texts (see my previous posting) will help greatly with maintaining the translations.

Excellent question, however I've become involved with the translation efforts mainly through policy and intellectual property concerns. 
Since this is an editorial issue, I'm cc'ing w3c-translators@w3.org and the HTML 4.0 editors. 
My initial response would to do a literal translation, including the errors. 
Another possibility, as you say is to, is to make note where you made the corrections, perhaps using a different color text or some such thing, but I am personally less comfortable with that. 
Mr. Diodati, I spoke with the some of the W3C team including management and our continued policy is that translation should be literal, including errors. 
However, you may also translate the errata page.

The following is my opinion and does not represent W3C policy: 
When translating a technical document, I think translators should stay as close to the text as they can since (I don't feel as strongly about translating non-technical documents). 
However, I don't think it makes sense to translate recognized editorial errors, i.e., those that the original authors have clearly listed on the errata page. 
If we wrote "the the" by mistake, French translators should not have to write "le le" and translate the errata sheet to read "Le texte d'origine contient par erreur 'le le'". 
The HTML 4.0 errata sheet is clearly divided into two sections: stupid editorial mistakes on one hand and editorial or semantic 
ambiguities on the other. 
I think translators should be allowed to eliminate the first class of errors, perhaps with a note in the translation stating that the error was corrected ; 
the erratum itself should not be translated. 
For the second class of errors, translators should leave the spec as is and point to a translated errata sheet. 
In the latter case, it makes sense (and is important) to provide a translation of the semantic error. 
Please note that I am only referring to errors that the authors and Working Group members have identified as errors.

Makes sense. 
This is good for HTML, that it even has an errata sheet, but other specs may not and I'd like to keep people constrained. 
This seems reasonable, but I hesitate to even mention this in a sense, it makes are policy that more complicated in a sense. 
I think this may be one of those instances where the official policy is, "please translate literally" but "if you delete a 'the the' we aren't going to complain." 
In the specific instance of HTML4.0, the "minor typographical errors" could be something we accept. 
Agreed. 
If the other editors of the HTML spec don't mind having the "minor typographical errors" corrected in translations, I'll be happy to follow up with Mr. Diodati. 
(Or you can even, please cc: me.) 
Thank you for your further explanation. 
There is no problem for us in translating the errata document too. 
My approach to the problem of known errors concerns principles, not the number of file that we have to translate. 
I recognize that copyright laws and ethics want total conformity to the original text, but I think, at the same time, that integrating also the semantic errors listed in html40-errata.html 
into our translation would make the italian document more simple and comprehensible, as well compliant to the semantic of the original english document (provided that we include, wrapped around the correct text, a note and a link to the relative error listed in html40-errata.html). 
However this is only an opinion, so I do not have problems to adapt our translation to the directives suggested from the W3C.

Well, we will follow your suggestions: our translation will be literal, including errors. 
We will add, when an error occurs, a note (looking clearly different from the surrounding text) with a link to the relative correction listed in html40-errata.html.
