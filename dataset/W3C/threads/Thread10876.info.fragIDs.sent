<s> I fear all the discussion about FPIs as URNs has sailed right over  </s>
<s> The ERB is highly concerned, in at least a significant minority, about the effects of putting this facility in without specifying a resolution mechanism.  </s>
<s> Doing so would contravene one of the major design goals of XML - that any compliant XML processor should be able to read any compliant XML document.  </s>
<s> Understanding a name ("reading" it) is different from being able to resolve it and obtain the object it names.  </s>
<s> If the design goal is really that all reference must always work, be they SYSTEM or PUBLIC, you'll have to discard it anyway.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, there is also substantial concern about giving an unconditional blessing to any particular name resolution mechanism at this point in history.  </s>
<s> If name resolution lies outside the scope of the XML spec, as I think it ought, then no particular mechanism at all should even be mentioned.  </s>
<s> Your choice seems to lie between treating PUBLIC IDs as URNs, which means "hand it off to your URN resolver"; defining a mechanism for resolving some larger class of vaguely "public" identifiers peculiar to XML; and defining some particular way to resolve FPIs for the Internet.  </s>
<s> The last course would preclude using URNs that aren't FPIs, which is not a very appealing or sensible course.  </s>
<s> If the decision is "hand it off to your URN resolver," then no resolution mechanism need be recommended or required; URNs are names, you will resolve by whatever means suit you best.  </s>
<s> Thus, there are a variety of options open to us.  </s>
<s> Not those you list (see above).  </s>
<s> The ERB's in a pretty deep hole on this one, having deleted from SGML an essential capacity for indirection.  </s>
<s> 1. Leave it as it is  </s>
<s> And appear hidebound, ignoring the example of peer specs such as VRML, the existence of IETF activity on URNs, and the utility of indirection.  </s>
<s> Will that appeal to your target audiences?  </s>
<s> will that persuade the great unparsed public that SGML experts have a clue and that their XML spec can be regarded seriously?  </s>
<s> 2. Agree that we'll put PUBLIC identifiers into XML *when* we are ready to specify the resolution mechanism; the practical effect is almost certainly that they don't go in for now.  </s>
<s> Equivalent to 1.  </s>
<s> 3. Put a slot in the syntax for PUBLIC identifiers... 3* ...and require an accompanying SYSTEM identifier  </s>
<s> Why require?  </s>
<s> Just say that the author has the two choices of how to refer, by URL (SYSTEM) or URN (PUBLIC), or both.  </s>
<s> If you like, point out that URN resolvers are no more widely deployed than user agents that read XML, and *recommend* use of a SYSTEM identifier if the author isn't confident that the PUBLIC ID  </s>
<s> will be resolved by his target audience.  </s>
<s> To the extent it doesn't work right now, people won't use it exclusively.  </s>
<s> 3a - say nothing about resolution mechanisms, perhaps providing a taxonomy of available technologies in this area  </s>
<s> Bingo.  </s>
<s> If you define PUBLIC IDs as URNs, resolution mechanisms are entirely out of scope.  </s>
<s> Which is a big win for the size and simplicity of the XML spec and of XML applications.  </s>
<s> But I think you must say that PUBLIC IDs are to be resolved as URNs to grasp the laurels.  </s>
<s> 3b - document one resolution mechanism, but not make it required.  </s>
<s> This is somewhat similar to our i18n approach, where we bless 2 encodings but admit the possibility that people use others.  </s>
<s> That is, add unnecessary verbiage.  </s>
<s> Your i18n approach is not a good parallel; it does make requirements on user agents.  </s>
<s> 3c - document one resolution mechanism as before, but make its use mandatory for XML processors.  </s>
<s> Meaningless if PUBLIC IDs are URNs.  </s>
<s> Note that there is a continuum between 3b and 3c; we could place varying strengths of recommendation behind one resolution mechanism, with homilies about document portability.  </s>
<s> Not really.  </s>
<s> So far as implementation conformance is concerned, there is only SHOULD and MUST.  </s>
<s> Jawboning counts for nothing in the Internet standards game.  </s>
<s> In the area of which resolution mechanism to (perhaps nonexclusively) bless, SGML/Open catalogs (hereinafter Socats) stand out, and would probably be the ERB's choice.  </s>

<s> Yesterday's URN session at IETF was eerily harmonious, especially for that group, *as if people understood that they were close to acheiving something they all think is extremely valuable and which they want to use as soon as possible*.  </s>
<s> The syntax draft is very nearly complete (it doesn't have whitespace problems).  </s>

<s> Subject: Re: re ERB discussion of public identifiers Why require?  </s>
<s> (a SYSTEM id) Because to go by current performance, processors and apps on the Web neither know nor care about PUBLIC indentifiers (with one or two obvious exclusions), and certainly wouldn't know where to go to broker a request for resolution.  </s>
<s> I agree with Terry that this is theoretically suspect, but practical considerations have made me side with Peter up till now.  </s>
<s> However, Terry made a good point -- URNs will not be widely used for publication until thereS is a widely implemented resolution base, so there will be no need to require SYSTEM IDs as people will need them and include them.  </s>
<s> Once at least one URN scheme is widely deployed, then there may be no point in requiring a SYSTEM ID.  </s>
<s> I find this market logic pretty convincing, but I can accept the compromise as require SYSTEM IDs even though they may not be necessary.  </s>
<s> Just say that the author has the two choices of how to refer, by URL (SYSTEM) or URN (PUBLIC), or both.  </s>
<s> This is exactly the problem I pointed out the other day.  </s>
<s> It is insufficient to allow both without indicating the sequence in which they should be tried, regardless of how any resolution is to be performed.  </s>
<s> I think this point is important: even more importantly, the URN (FPI) should take priority, if it is resolvable -- since URN resolution, when applicable, has more options to produce the "best" copy -- since it is constrained only by the identity restrictions of URNs, rather than the location restrictions of SYSTEM identifiers.  </s>
<s> ///Peter  </s>
<s> And I meant to reply to your point, but forgot.  </s>
<s> - why is order significant to correct resolution?  </s>
<s> Not so much the order, as bothering to see if the other reference is given.  </s>
<s> The problem arises when you carefully provide a SYSTEM identifier so that if the user's host cannot provide PUBLIC resolution, the SYSTEM one can be used...and the app just looks at the PUBLIC one, says "I can't do this" and gives up, never looking to see if there was a SYSTEM identifier that might be usable.  </s>
<s> [And by the same token, apps which grab the SYSTEM identifier first, find it doesn't work (or they can't make it work) and then don't bother trying the carefully-provided PUBLIC identifier.] - why does the XML spec need to specify the order rather than the user's configuration file?  </s>
<s> If the user has a config file that specifies it, sure, use it, no problem.  </s>
<s> - why shouldn't the user have the option of trying both, and doing something further if the two results don't match?  </s>
<s> They should.  </s>
<s> But it may be the app that won't let them do this.  </s>
