Cheers, Geoff Even though we've made it through a couple of last calls, and we're on the path to IETF last call and Proposed Standard, I'd still like to schedule some design team meetings during IETF 50. 
How about 3-5pm on Wed to prepare for the Working Group meeting, 11-3pm on Thu for detailed discussions, and a 9-12 on Fri to followup on any post-Working Group issues? 
I may have to leave a little early on Friday to make a flight.

Looks like our DeltaV Working Group meeting got moved to Friday 9:00 to 11:30. 
So I propose the following new schedule for the DeltaV design team meetings: Thursday 9:00 to 11:30 WebDAV Working Group Meeting Thursday 11:30 to 5:00 DeltaV Design Team Meeting: Prepare for the Working Group meeting and detailed discussion on remaining issues Friday 9:00 to 11:30 DeltaV Working Group Meeting Friday 11:30 to 3:00 DeltaV Design Team Meeting: Wrapup and address issues that were raised in the Working Group Meeting.
