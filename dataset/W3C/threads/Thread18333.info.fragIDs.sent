Earl, The User Agent Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has almost finished resolving the issues raised during the third last call review of the 9 April 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1]. 
This is the UAWG's formal response to the issue you raised on behalf of Sun, which has been logged in the Working Group's issues list [4]. 
The UAWG's resolution and other editorial suggestions have been incorporated into the 22 June 2001 draft of the UAAG 1.0 [5]. 
Please indicate before 19 July whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's resolution, whether you think there has been a misunderstanding, or whether you wish to register an objection. 
If you do not think you can respond before 19 July, please let me know. 
The Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the resolution or not. 
Below you will find: 1) More information follows about the process we are following. 
2) A summary of the UAWG's response to your issue. 
Thank you, 
_ Ian 1) Process requirement to address last call issues 
Per section 5.2.3 [2] of the 8 February 2001 Process Document, in order for the UAAG 1.0 to advance to the next state (Candidate Recommendation), the Working Group must "formally address all issues raised during the Last Call review period (possibly modifying the technical report)." 
Section 4.1.2 of the Process Document [3] sets expectations about what constitutes a formal response: "In the context of this document, a Working Group has formally addressed an issue when the Chair can show (archived) evidence of having sent a response to the party who raised the issue. 
This response should include the Working Group's resolution and should ask the party who raised the issue to reply with an indication of whether the resolution reverses the initial objection." 
If you feel that the response is based on a misunderstanding of the original issue, you are encouraged to restate and clarify the issue until there is agreement about the issue, so that the Working Group may prepare its substantive response. 
If the response shows understanding of the original issue but does not satisfy the reviewer, you may register a formal objection with the Working Group that will be carried forward with the relevant deliverables. 
There are currently two objections that the UAWG will carry forward with the document in a request to advance to Candidate Recommendation. 
Each concerns the priority of checkpoint 12.1, one that the priority should be lowered, the other that the priority should be raised. 
There are additional supporters of each position.

Resolution: The UAWG has adopted the following definition (adapted from the definition you proposed): "An applet is a program (generally written in the Java programming language) that is part of content, and that the user agent executes."
