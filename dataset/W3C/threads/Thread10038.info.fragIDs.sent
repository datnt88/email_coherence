<s> none of the above Patrick, just 3. the object of that statement *is* the typeless lexical form "somestring" I think we need the primitive notion of a typeless lexical form which is just denoting itself and of course it could be paired with a rdfs:Datatype to describe a datatyped value but it must also exist independently I think and identified with itself  </s>

<s> Well, any literal that is typed as xsd:string or a similar datatype serves this purpose, does it not?  </s>
<s> Specifying that the datatype of the literal is a string is synonymous with the tidy interpretation of the literal denoting its lexical form component.  </s>
<s> The lexical form of the string typed literal maps to the string value that is identitical to the lexical form (i.e the mapping is equality).  </s>
<s> Thus xsd:string"foo" with untidy semantics is equivalent to "foo" with tidy semantics.  </s>
<s> In essence, string typing provides tidy semantics, but you just have to say that's what you want.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I'm not fully understanding you.  </s>
<s> I'm still struggling to see the added utility of the "typeless" literal over the string typed literal, apart from perhaps syntactic sugar so one doesn't have to type as much.  </s>
