<s> Charles, What happens is that the user agent can enumerate a number of voice labels that are typically made available to users as a list of voice options.  </s>
<s> Each voice label has its own pitch range and other voice filter parameters that determine the "sound" and "accent" of the voice (i.e adult male, child female, robotic...).  </s>
<s> Usually features like average pitch and speech rate can be adjusted within a voice label, but the other voice filtering parameters like pitch range, stress and richness cannot be adjusted within the label.  </s>
<s> Therefore the voice label confounds these later voice filter parameters since they cannot be adjusted manually, and typically if you allow the user to adjust these filters manually they can easily set filter parameters that result in unstable speech filters (i.e. noise rather than speech is generated).  </s>
<s> But I would leave it to the editors to find the right words.  </s>

<s> I checked, and confound can be used like this, but it has more other interpretations than combine.  </s>
