Hi all, Does Amaya add any information (inside its request) about the current selected profile (Special\Preferences\Profiles)? 
If not, it will be very interessting to add that, for example using the "user agent" header field (ex: "User-Agent: amaya/7.1 libwww/5.3.1 Mini-browser"). 
This will help adaptation-enabled servers to take into account the current profile of the user. 
Best regards Tayeb* Tayeb Lemlouma Opera project National Research Institute in Computer Science and Control (INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes, France ) Actually I recall that somebody implemented CC/PP for Amaya, but can't find the references at the moment.

He says that he tries to implement a prototype of an application of libWWW for CC/PP, but no further information is given. 
Did you recall the same implementation?
