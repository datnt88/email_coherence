Proposal for UA guidelines: Presenting an ALT-text or LONGDESC to the user - It must be clear when an ALT-text is available/presented. - It must be clear if a LONGDESC is available. 
- It must be clear when a LONGDESC is presented.

ALT text is replacement text for the image. 
Good ALT text fits seamlessly into the context of the document, without the need to announce "Hey, there's an image here!". 
ALT text should be presented as if it were normal text and there was no image. 
Let's look at a common example: If the UA makes it clear that ALT text is being presented, the aural user hears something like "ALT: Welcome to the Web Design Group". 
If the UA presents ALT text as normal text, the aural user hears "Welcome to the Web Design Group". 
In my opinion, the latter is much easier to listen to and understand. 
The fact that the information is presented with an image on graphical browsers should not be of interest to the average aural user; if the user were interested in the image, then he or she should get a hold of the LONGDESC if one is available. 
Agreed. 
I guess so... My understanding of LONGDESC is that it would only be presented upon request of the user, in which case it would be obvious that the LONGDESC is being given. 
Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development That is the ideal situation. 
If the situation was always so nice I would fully agrre. 
We of course ask for good ALT texts and LONGDESCs. 
I like and agree on yhour good example which is ... ideal. 
The real situation is though that we may be glad if there is an ALT text and we may even be happy if there is a LONGDESC. 
I would like to know when a posible pitfall is nearby and there for I do not want to trust on possible good ALTs. 
Just to replace a "possible good ALT" by being sure "an ALT has been added to someting els". 
We ALWAYS must be aware there is something for which an ALT is added i.e. it is an alternative, a stand in, never a 100 % garanteed form of the origional thing showed.

Let's not make the ideal impossible to reach by assuming that authors can't write good ALT text. 
We can recognize that some authors can't write good ALT text and accommodate this by providing a user option to render ALT text distinctly. 
But requiring a distinct rendering for ALT text would make it impossible for us to achieve the kind of seamless device-independence that would make the Web truly accessible. 
Which means that you can never enjoy the clean presentation of a page with good ALTs. 
Users should have the option to trust or not trust the author to provide a device-independent document. 
Perhaps browsers could save these trust relationships for future visits so that the user doesn't have to bother switching between the two modes.
