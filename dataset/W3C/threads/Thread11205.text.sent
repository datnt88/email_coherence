3.2.b 
Should the locators of a general link be packaged in attributes as in HyTime, or as child elements as in the initial draft? 
I liked the child elements approach, especially as that means many (most) of the attributes in each locator sub-element will be the same as ones in in-line link elements (or whatever they are to be called). 
ht There is one syntactic advantage i see to the element approach: It provides a way to attach additional information to each linkend. 
If, for example, the user wants to add an explainerHHHHH^H label to each linkend, it's a lot cleaner to do it with subelements: LINKEND ROLE=AUTHOR HREF="http://www.ebt.com//u/sjd/bio.htm" 
LINKEND ROLE=TEXT1 HREF="http://lit.org//milton/paradise_lost.htm#27966" 
LABEL="In this passage Milton clearly alludes to D. Steele." LINKEND ROLE=TEXT2 HREF="http://lit.org//dsteele/yet_another.htm" LABEL="See, they both talk about people." Try combining them LABELs into one element! 
Obviously doable by introducing internal syntax (prohibit semicolon or something and pack 'em up). 
But ugly. 
Steve To allow maximum flexibility in DTD design, I would prefer that both be allowed (in fact I'd like to see this in HyTime too...). 
If it has to be one or the other, I'd vote for putting them in atttributes (partly for compatibility with HyTime, and partly because that seems like the simplest and easiest to use).

My feeling is no, we should use attributes. 
Now to comment on Steve's answer, because it may illumuninate my own. 
I agree that this syntax is better for explainers, but it's less-compatible with the "new" HyTime as I understand it, and it means that we have to talk about content models which I would like to leave completely open to the user. 
So, although I love explainers (Labels), and have spent years arguing that they should be supported by Hypertext systems, I'd rather lose them and keep the syntax simpler and more flexible. 
It will also keep our Mini-AF description much shorter and more understandable, as all we need to specify are attributes, and we don't even need to raise the confusing questions of what meta-content models mean and require.

Dave For in-line links they should be attributes, but for external links we should allow users to associate child elements with a default set of attribute values, e.g. Martin Bryan, The SGML Centre, Churchdown, Glos. 
GL3 2PU, UK Not sure what general link is. 
Attributes for URLs are established practice and the same kind of structure is used in other SGML DTDs links. 
Information in child elements should be alternates or external linking information.
