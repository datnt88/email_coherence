<s> Which  </s>
<s> is the publishing environment?  </s>
<s> I've been assuming that Domino is Lotus'  </s>
<s> webserver, simmilar to Apatchy and etc.  </s>
<s> It just serves pages.  </s>
<s> The publishing  </s>
<s> environment is Notes.  </s>
<s> It provides a way to specify the look and feel of the site and takes care of generating the HTML from the specifications.  </s>
<s> How  </s>
<s> exactly does this happen?  </s>
<s> How much control over the HTML being generated does the designer have?  </s>
<s> Does it use all the new features of HTML4 (label fields on form buttons, etc)?  </s>
<s> The biggest problem we are having is with the bullet (or twistie) frobs which appear anywhere an object is referenced in a list or database view.  </s>
<s> See the directory or events pages on www.accessexpressed.net.  </s>
<s> I've seen this same kind of layout all over the net, mostly on webpages providing an interface to usenet or mailing list archives, a great application for a database.  </s>
<s> The twisties can be labeled (and are labeled as "+") and thus when images are turned off, clickable plus signs appear next to the text of items in the list.  </s>
<s> For example, we have an alphabetized index of all venues in our directory.  </s>
<s> The letters a through z appear with twisties next to them.  </s>
<s> Clicking on the graphic opens up the list, inserting the database items after the propper letter and changing the graphic to indicate that a expansion of the list is in affect.  </s>
<s> Clicking on the twistie again collapses the list removing the database items.  </s>
<s> This is hard to use with a screen reader.  </s>
<s> The designer says that the text to which the graphic refers cannot be made an anchor (clickable link).  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> This kind of layout appears throughout our site.  </s>
<s> Please excuse my rambling, but I want to understand this stuff so I can make clear and hopefully informative recomendations to our web designers.  </s>
<s> Is there any technical docs on this stuff I can look at?  </s>
<s> Any info you can provides is most appreciated.  </s>
<s> On Tuesday, August 04, 1998 8:16 PM, Robert_Savellis@agd.nsw.gov.au  </s>
<s> Rich, I am the webmaster for the NSW Attorney General's Department in  </s>
<s> Australia.  </s>
<s> When I designed our first website, it was based on flat HTML.  </s>
<s> As this department had an emphasis on providing access to community, I based the design on a collection of principles that were called the AUS Accessibility Standards, that were  </s>
<s> also  </s>
<s> adopted by other NSW government agencies at the time.  </s>
<s> As such, we were proud of the accessible nature of the website.  </s>
<s> Two months ago, we launched our new website.  </s>
<s> This website is at www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au  </s>
<s> This site resides on a Domino web server.  </s>
<s> My greatest concern at moving over to Domino was that the HTML component was being removed from the control of the author, and placed in the hands of the web server.  </s>
<s> Effectively, the author creates the content in Rich Text Format, and the Server calculates the HTML equivalent when rendering it over the web.  </s>
<s> As such, I was worried that I would not be able to apply access  </s>
<s> principles  </s>
<s> to this site as with the previous.  </s>
<s> There was a lot of trial and error in the design of our new website, and  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> even posted a few questions on this list regarding the access implications of Domino.  </s>
<s> In the end however, a combination of the following has made our site as accessible (or close to) as the previous site.  </s>
<s> 1. Configuring the template databases to render HTML in an accessible  </s>
<s> way.  </s>
<s> 2. The use of HTML in Notes Web Pages, where appropriate.  </s>
<s> 3. The use of many Accessibility principles in the (non-HTML) design of  </s>
<s> the  </s>
<s> pages.  </s>
<s> I will note that before launch we asked the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia to do a thorough testing of the site.  </s>
<s> They made some very constructive suggestions, but on the whole were very pleased with the results.  </s>
<s> Rich, I hope that this has been of some help.  </s>
<s> Regards Robert Savellis NOTE: Unlink your case, our website does not use the standard look or  </s>
<s> feel  </s>
<s> of a Notes database.  </s>
<s> It looks like an ordinary HTML based website.  </s>

<s> The site, as currently implemented, uses a Lotus Domino server  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> a Notes database.  </s>
<s> The interface uses the standard look and feel convensions of Lotus Notes, and is cumbersome at best, down right inaccessible at worst  </s>
<s> to  </s>
<s> blind users.  </s>
<s> My question is: is there a more accessible set of tools/interface builders which may make the interface more usable by the blind?  </s>
<s> Do we  </s>

<s> to redesign completely using a different database?  </s>
<s> Can we build a better interface on top of what already exists?  </s>
<s> While I understand the basics of html, client server architecture,  </s>
<s> etc  </s>
<s> I no nothing of Notes and Domino and the ways in which it is or is not customizable.  </s>
<s> I understand that these tools are quite popular for they provide a seemingly flexable and consistant way of designing interfaces on top of a fairly sophisticated database with minimal effort.  </s>
<s> It seems that one of the biggest barriers to accessibility is the lack of accessability-related features integrated into most popular web publishing environments.  </s>
<s> I think a good easy to use powerful publishing environment whose designers are aware of accessibility issues would be a big win for disabled people net-wide.  </s>

<s> Use IE to tab to a twistie.  </s>
<s> The assitive technology will say what is in the box and that is it.  </s>
<s> Tell me why a "twistie" need to be associated with a label.  </s>
<s> There is absolutely no rule that tells the user that this is a "twistie" and what to say with it.  </s>
<s> There is not enough semantic information.  </s>

<s> We might suggest to the WAI group that we create a labelFor for tag.  </s>
<s> This might also help with FORM element labeling.  </s>
<s> For example this HTML object or text is a label for this other HTML object.  </s>
<s> Here is a possible implementation for a twistie if we were to suggest such an implemenation: A HREF="http:..." NAME="foo" IMG SRC="twistieexpand.gif" ALT="+" LABELFOR TARGETNAME="foo" List of WAI Gurus /LABELFOR  </s>

<s> I have not seen these twisties, so I am guessing a bit here, but It seems that the twisties should be covered by the GL recommendation - use meaningful links.  </s>
<s> As I read this discusssion, that means that the associated text should be prt of the link.  </s>
<s> I am imagining something like some websites use, where a list uses graphic bullets which are links, while the explanatory text is not a link.  </s>
<s> This seems to me counter to the idea behind hypertext such as HTML, which makes it possible for the text itself to be active, rather than the old Prestel-type systems, which simply provided for linking of objects, nd text descriptions of what the links might be.  </s>
<s> If the Notes/Domino solution cannot provide that (and I would be surprised if that were the case) then it is a poor solution indeed.  </s>
<s> On the other hnd, it does highlight the fact that this is not necessarily simple, and people need to understand their tools.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> Rich,  </s>
<s> Lotus'  </s>
<s> Yes, you are correct, Domino is the WEB SERVER.  </s>
<s> Lotus Notes is a groupware product (which includes email), but it also performs the role of a WEB EDITOR.  </s>
<s> Notes itself doesn't generate the HTML.  </s>
<s> This is done by Domino.  </s>
<s> Basically, the information you create in Notes is created as RTF (rich text format - much like with Word), and once created, it sits on Domino in a database as RTF.  </s>
<s> When someone views the document on Domino, Domino adds HTML to the document (only while the document is being viewed.)  </s>
<s> The beauty of the RTF method is that you can copy and paste an Excel spreadsheet for instance, and it renders perfectly on the web.  </s>
<s> How much control over the HTML being generated does the designer have?  </s>
<s> The lawlink site is a based on a Notes template that I designed.  </s>
<s> Within this notes template, I have added HTML for all the important design features.  </s>
<s> This html is hidden from the webpage authors who use this template.  </s>
<s> The HTML components include the header, the background image, the footer and the body tag.  </s>
<s> See the following as an example: Therefore, I have minimised what Domino has to render into HTML, in the view that this will eliminate the risk of Domino rendering certain things inaccessibly.  </s>
<s> However, Domino still renders the following: *All text sizes and colours.  </s>
<s> *All tables.  </s>
<s> *Some of the graphics in the body (I use html to insert some graphics, and Notes for others, depending on certain parameters--- eg, Notes graphics have colours restricted to the Notes pallette.) *All links, apart from header and footer.  </s>
<s> *As I do not create views as webpages (ie, different columns of data), the lawlink site rarely has twisties.  </s>
<s> The only pages that have twisties are databases that were specifically designed for an internal environment, and then we tried to re-designed them for the web.  </s>
<s> View the following as an example: OpenView Hope that helps.  </s>
<s> Robert Savellis  </s>
<s> [follow-up to discussion of the Lotus Notes/Domino implementation of expanding lists with inscrutable "+/-" link text on twisties.]  </s>
<s> The existing rule about "use meaningful link text" explains why using plus and minus as the link text for twisties does not work for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> But it does not really tell you what to do about it because a long substitution would get tedious even in speech.  </s>
<s> We probably need to step back and see what the twisties are doing for us to understand the problem.  </s>
<s> Twisties are used as controls inside what we might call "accordion lists" by analogy to "accordion file" containers for information on paper.  </s>
<s> These are list structures similar to a table of contents that the user interface lets you fold and expand on a section by section basis.  </s>
<s> Users of MacOS since version 7 and Microsoft Windows since Windows 95 will be familiar with this in the file system interface.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the visual user can see where the un-changed parts of the list come back in the adjusted list presentation.  </s>
<s> It is not similarly easy to perceive the structure in terms of changed and unchanged segments in audio, so far as I know.  </s>
<s> Accordion lists are visual context-savers for exploring hierarchical information structures.  </s>
<s> I might even say that accordion lists are a best current practice for this function.  </s>
<s> If there is a comparable best current practice for saving context inside a hierarchical domain, in the context of an audio user interface, I don't know what it is.  </s>
<s> What to do about it?  </s>
<s> This could easily get technical enough and voluble enough to be worth moving off the general interest list.  </s>
<s> There are several groups that are potentially affected: User Agent, Page Author, Authoring Tools, Protocols and Formats.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should try an ad-hoc action team.  </s>
<s> If people will volunteer to work on how to make accordion lists accessible, then we can move the discussion off the Interest Group list.  </s>
<s> The WAI Coordination Group w3c-wai-cg@w3.org can worry about what sort of a coordination process will keep the interested groups tuned in.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman PS: HTML 4 already has the functionality suggested as LABELFOR for form controls, but not for general links.  </s>
<s> The usability concerns are the same whether the interface behavior is done with Javascript or CGI.  </s>
<s> Is the problem just with the symbols used for the twisties or do people see it as a more general problem of expandable and contractable lists?  </s>
