The website in question is http://www.accessexpressed.net. 
I'm still a bit unclear as to the relationship between Notes and Domino. 
Which 
is the publishing environment? 
I've been assuming that Domino is Lotus' 
webserver, simmilar to Apatchy and etc. 
It just serves pages. 
The publishing 
environment is Notes. 
It provides a way to specify the look and feel of the site and takes care of generating the HTML from the specifications. 
How 
exactly does this happen? 
How much control over the HTML being generated does the designer have? 
Does it use all the new features of HTML4 (label fields on form buttons, etc)? 
The biggest problem we are having is with the bullet (or twistie) frobs which appear anywhere an object is referenced in a list or database view. 
See the directory or events pages on www.accessexpressed.net. 
I've seen this same kind of layout all over the net, mostly on webpages providing an interface to usenet or mailing list archives, a great application for a database. 
The twisties can be labeled (and are labeled as "+") and thus when images are turned off, clickable plus signs appear next to the text of items in the list. 
For example, we have an alphabetized index of all venues in our directory. 
The letters a through z appear with twisties next to them. 
Clicking on the graphic opens up the list, inserting the database items after the propper letter and changing the graphic to indicate that a expansion of the list is in affect. 
Clicking on the twistie again collapses the list removing the database items. 
This is hard to use with a screen reader. 
The designer says that the text to which the graphic refers cannot be made an anchor (clickable link). 
Why? 
This kind of layout appears throughout our site. 
Please excuse my rambling, but I want to understand this stuff so I can make clear and hopefully informative recomendations to our web designers. 
Is there any technical docs on this stuff I can look at? 
Any info you can provides is most appreciated.

Rich, I am the webmaster for the NSW Attorney General's Department in 
Australia. 
When I designed our first website, it was based on flat HTML. 
As this department had an emphasis on providing access to community, I based the design on a collection of principles that were called the AUS Accessibility Standards, that were 
also 
adopted by other NSW government agencies at the time. 
As such, we were proud of the accessible nature of the website. 
Two months ago, we launched our new website. 
This website is at www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au 
This site resides on a Domino web server. 
My greatest concern at moving over to Domino was that the HTML component was being removed from the control of the author, and placed in the hands of the web server. 
Effectively, the author creates the content in Rich Text Format, and the Server calculates the HTML equivalent when rendering it over the web. 
As such, I was worried that I would not be able to apply access 
principles 
to this site as with the previous. 
There was a lot of trial and error in the design of our new website, and 
I 
even posted a few questions on this list regarding the access implications of Domino. 
In the end however, a combination of the following has made our site as accessible (or close to) as the previous site. 
1. Configuring the template databases to render HTML in an accessible 
way. 
2. The use of HTML in Notes Web Pages, where appropriate. 
3. The use of many Accessibility principles in the (non-HTML) design of 
the 
pages. 
I will note that before launch we asked the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia to do a thorough testing of the site. 
They made some very constructive suggestions, but on the whole were very pleased with the results. 
Rich, I hope that this has been of some help. 
Regards Robert Savellis NOTE: Unlink your case, our website does not use the standard look or 
feel 
of a Notes database. 
It looks like an ordinary HTML based website.

webwatch-l@teleport.com cc: (bcc: Robert Savellis/FSS/NSW_AG) Subject: Lotus Notes/Domino and accessability by the blind Our company, Very Special Arts Massachusetts, is developing a website, www.accessexpressed.net, which provides disability accessibility information related to various cultural organizations (theaters, museums, and other venues). 
The site, as currently implemented, uses a Lotus Domino server 
and 
a Notes database. 
The interface uses the standard look and feel convensions of Lotus Notes, and is cumbersome at best, down right inaccessible at worst 
to 
blind users. 
My question is: is there a more accessible set of tools/interface builders which may make the interface more usable by the blind? 
Do we 
need 
to redesign completely using a different database? 
Can we build a better interface on top of what already exists? 
While I understand the basics of html, client server architecture, 
etc 
I no nothing of Notes and Domino and the ways in which it is or is not customizable. 
I understand that these tools are quite popular for they provide a seemingly flexable and consistant way of designing interfaces on top of a fairly sophisticated database with minimal effort. 
It seems that one of the biggest barriers to accessibility is the lack of accessability-related features integrated into most popular web publishing environments. 
I think a good easy to use powerful publishing environment whose designers are aware of accessibility issues would be a big win for disabled people net-wide.

Rich, Your said "This is hard to use with a screen reader." 
Why is + or - next to a text label hard to use with a screen reader? 
Whether 
visually or aurally browsing, I have to associate the "twistie" with text label. 
Similar to bullets in a list, only twistie's have a function other than 
identifying them as a list item... 
I agree it might be easier if the +/- link include the adjacent text label when 
viewing only links. 
Is that what you want Notes/Domino to do? 
Since this is a specific topic - I would like to take this discussion off the wai-ig interest list.

Domino is NOT just a Web server, it does handle some of the publishing task because it knows all about Notes and the application you've designed. 
I would also recommend the following to anyone who wants to understand more: Developing Web Applications Using Lotus Notes Designer for Domino 4.6 This redbook describes how to develop applications using Notes Designer for Domino Release 4.6, specifically for users accessing Domino from Web browsers. 
Domino combines the open networking environment of Internet standards and protocols with the powerful application development facilities of Lotus Notes, enabling you to develop a broad range of business applications for the Internet and intranet. 
The earlier chapters of the book introduce the concepts of Domino and creating Web applications using Domino, for those readers who may be familiar with Web application development but not necessarily with using Lotus Notes/Domino for that development. 
The book then describes how to use Domino design elements such as databases, forms, subforms, views, navigators, and agents to create Web applications. 
Other chapters illustrate how to include traditional Web development items, such as HTML, Java and JavaScript, in Domino applications. 
The redbook was written for Domino technical specialists and programmers in customers, IBM business partners, and the IBM and Lotus community, who need a good technical understanding of how to develop Web applications using Domino Release 4.6.

Phill, I'll make this simple. 
Use IE to tab to a twistie. 
The assitive technology will say what is in the box and that is it. 
Tell me why a "twistie" need to be associated with a label. 
There is absolutely no rule that tells the user that this is a "twistie" and what to say with it. 
There is not enough semantic information. 
This is a limitation of mainstay screen reading technology today and the WAI HTML guidelines. 
We might suggest to the WAI group that we create a labelFor for tag. 
This might also help with FORM element labeling. 
For example this HTML object or text is a label for this other HTML object. 
Here is a possible implementation for a twistie if we were to suggest such an implemenation: A HREF="http:..." NAME="foo" IMG SRC="twistieexpand.gif" ALT="+" LABELFOR TARGETNAME="foo" List of WAI Gurus /LABELFOR 
when viewing only links. 
Is that what you  want Notes/Domino to do? 
Yes, for twisties that is true. 
This was suggested solution before. 
visually or aurally browsing, I have to  associate the "twistie" with text label. 
Similar to bullets in a list, only twistie's have a function other than 
Bullets in a list are implemented by known browser images in which case this could be hacked. 
Secondly the HTML source tells you that these are explicity list items i.e: LI . 
... hence semantic information through known tags in the context of a list ordered or not. 
You can take this off the WAI IG list if you believe that there is no need for suggesting a labelfor tag definition. 
This seems a logical extension given all the descriptive text added for tables.

I have not seen these twisties, so I am guessing a bit here, but It seems that the twisties should be covered by the GL recommendation - use meaningful links. 
As I read this discusssion, that means that the associated text should be prt of the link. 
I am imagining something like some websites use, where a list uses graphic bullets which are links, while the explanatory text is not a link. 
This seems to me counter to the idea behind hypertext such as HTML, which makes it possible for the text itself to be active, rather than the old Prestel-type systems, which simply provided for linking of objects, nd text descriptions of what the links might be. 
If the Notes/Domino solution cannot provide that (and I would be surprised if that were the case) then it is a poor solution indeed. 
On the other hnd, it does highlight the fact that this is not necessarily simple, and people need to understand their tools.

Rich, 
Lotus' 
Yes, you are correct, Domino is the WEB SERVER. 
Lotus Notes is a groupware product (which includes email), but it also performs the role of a WEB EDITOR. 
Notes itself doesn't generate the HTML. 
This is done by Domino. 
Basically, the information you create in Notes is created as RTF (rich text format - much like with Word), and once created, it sits on Domino in a database as RTF. 
When someone views the document on Domino, Domino adds HTML to the document (only while the document is being viewed.) 
The beauty of the RTF method is that you can copy and paste an Excel spreadsheet for instance, and it renders perfectly on the web. 
How much control over the HTML being generated does the designer have? 
The lawlink site is a based on a Notes template that I designed. 
Within this notes template, I have added HTML for all the important design features. 
This html is hidden from the webpage authors who use this template. 
The HTML components include the header, the background image, the footer and the body tag. 
See the following as an example: Therefore, I have minimised what Domino has to render into HTML, in the view that this will eliminate the risk of Domino rendering certain things inaccessibly. 
However, Domino still renders the following: *All text sizes and colours. 
*All tables. 
*Some of the graphics in the body (I use html to insert some graphics, and Notes for others, depending on certain parameters--- eg, Notes graphics have colours restricted to the Notes pallette.) *All links, apart from header and footer. 
*As I do not create views as webpages (ie, different columns of data), the lawlink site rarely has twisties. 
The only pages that have twisties are databases that were specifically designed for an internal environment, and then we tried to re-designed them for the web. 
View the following as an example: OpenView Hope that helps. 
Robert Savellis 
[follow-up to discussion of the Lotus Notes/Domino implementation of expanding lists with inscrutable "+/-" link text on twisties.] 
The existing rule about "use meaningful link text" explains why using plus and minus as the link text for twisties does not work for screen reader users. 
But it does not really tell you what to do about it because a long substitution would get tedious even in speech. 
We probably need to step back and see what the twisties are doing for us to understand the problem. 
Twisties are used as controls inside what we might call "accordion lists" by analogy to "accordion file" containers for information on paper. 
These are list structures similar to a table of contents that the user interface lets you fold and expand on a section by section basis. 
Users of MacOS since version 7 and Microsoft Windows since Windows 95 will be familiar with this in the file system interface. 
The problem is that the visual user can see where the un-changed parts of the list come back in the adjusted list presentation. 
It is not similarly easy to perceive the structure in terms of changed and unchanged segments in audio, so far as I know. 
Accordion lists are visual context-savers for exploring hierarchical information structures. 
I might even say that accordion lists are a best current practice for this function. 
If there is a comparable best current practice for saving context inside a hierarchical domain, in the context of an audio user interface, I don't know what it is. 
What to do about it? 
This could easily get technical enough and voluble enough to be worth moving off the general interest list. 
There are several groups that are potentially affected: User Agent, Page Author, Authoring Tools, Protocols and Formats. 
Maybe we should try an ad-hoc action team. 
If people will volunteer to work on how to make accordion lists accessible, then we can move the discussion off the Interest Group list. 
The WAI Coordination Group w3c-wai-cg@w3.org can worry about what sort of a coordination process will keep the interested groups tuned in. 
Al Gilman PS: HTML 4 already has the functionality suggested as LABELFOR for form controls, but not for general links. 
The usability concerns are the same whether the interface behavior is done with Javascript or CGI. 
Is the problem just with the symbols used for the twisties or do people see it as a more general problem of expandable and contractable lists?

One possibility is to simply give users direct access to the hierarchy, via the following functions parent child next/prevous sibling(s). 
This does functionally some of what the accordion list does for sighted users, viz ability to quickly get items for above relationships. 
There is problem of getting lost as to which level you're in. 
Perhaps some explicit audio label (e.g. "level 1" preceding output) would do the trick. 
Or Raman's audio techniques.

For those of us who do not happen to have Notes available to them, can someone post a URL or provide sample files that demonstrate the twistie? 
I have a feeling I have seen this in a variety of pages using straight HTML links, DHTML, and ActiveX, resulting in a situation where we have the same UI implemented via different techniques.

trick. 
Actually I have seen this done in straight HTML. 
It is a visual metaphor, but it seems that it could be translated functionally to a more general technique. 
A simple approach would seem to combine the use of HTML lists with a marker which actually explained its function. 
The following example is very simplistic, but should be implementable in a tool which provides the mechanism in an accessible way. 
It assumes a new version of the page is generated, with an item expanded or collapsed, and ignorse the problem of keeping track of what is currently expanded/collapsed. 
The solution could certainly be applied recursively to give the tree structure familiar to visual users of this UI. Presumably the contents listed would also be linked to something, but I have left that out for legibility. 
I haven't looked at the spec to see what happens when using both a # and a ? 
extension - it may be the case that the server process needs to direct the browser to the named anchor. 
The idea is just to ensure that although the document changes the location remains static, for ease of navigational understanding. 
LI A HREF="thispage.xyz#chap1?expand=1" 
NAME="chap1" IMG SRC="expandicon.gif" ALT="Expand this item" /A Chapter 1 LI A HREF="thispage.xyz#chap2?collapse=2"

I would encourage all of you with advice on Notes/Domino to post your concerns and suggestions to the web forum at http://notes.net/46forum.nsf. 
This is where the Developers hang out and where your comments will do the most good. 
A new forum for version 5 of the software (under development) should be announced sometime soon. 
The Tech Watch group of NCD (National Council on Disabilities) talked with Lotus last year about access and they were receptive. 
Jamal Mazrui of NCD probably can hunt up the name of the contact within Lotus.
