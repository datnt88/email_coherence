Dear W3C experts: I'm just starting to dig in the W3C-recommendations,so I might miss something very elementary, now. 
But I'm very confused by the following opposition: In the DOM2-Events-recommendation "focus" is a valid method for the object "button, but in the DOM2-HTML-recommendation it's not mentioned (just like in the DOM1-HTML-recommendation). Could someone explain this? 
Thank you. 
Resources: Document Object Model Events focus The focus event occurs when an element receives focus either via a pointing device or by tabbing navigation. 
This event is valid for the following elements: LABEL, INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, and BUTTON. 
Document Object Model HTML Interface HTMLButtonElement Push button. 
See the BUTTON element definition in HTML 4.01. 
IDL Definition interface HTMLButtonElement : HTMLElement { readonly attribute HTMLFormElement form; attribute DOMString accessKey; attribute boolean disabled; attribute DOMString name; attribute long tabIndex; readonly attribute DOMString type; attribute DOMString value; This doesn't say that button has a "focus" method. 
It says that an event of type "focus" is dispatched to the button, and if the button has an event listener for this event type (created using addEventListener) the event listener will be triggered.

-- Voltaire Is the issue that calling the button.focus() 
method does not result in the generation of a "focus" event on the button? 
The HTML "focus" event is fired when the focus changes due to some user action. 
There is also the DOMFocusIn DOM 2 UIEvent that is fired when any focusable element receives focus.
