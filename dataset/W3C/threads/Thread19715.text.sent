I am using amaya-java on LINUX-ELF. 
After "mkdir 1 2 3 4 5 6" amaya started loading http:// pages, but still, all the pictures seem to be rendered incorrectly. 
Could it be because I am using truecolor visual? 
Also it would be nice if I didn't have to double-click to follow a link. 
A single click is quite enough. 
Nick. 
A single click would prevent from editing the text or the images that support the link. 
My question: I have two problems with displaying TABLEs. 
First, even when doing: DIV ALIGN=CENTER *and* TABLEs stay at the left of the page. 
Does this belong to the same "TABLE bug" already explained before? 
Thank you in advance.

'Panem et circences' Juvenal Depends what you do more often, edit or follow the link. 
I don't edit too much. 
So, maybe allow this option to be user configurable? 
Also amaya doesn't understand p align=justify , shape=polygon and shape=default in imagemaps. 
Nick. 
You are right, this is a bug. 
It will be fixed in the next release.

655 avenue de l'Europe p align=justify is not valid HTML 3.2. 
If you want to control style, you could use CSS instead. 
Try Style - Format - Justification in Amaya or write p style="text-align: justify" shape=polygon is not valid HTML 3.2. 
Try shape=poly instead. 
shape=default is not part of HTML 3.2.
