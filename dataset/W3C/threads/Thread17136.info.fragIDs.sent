In today's letigeous society, it is sad that it is possible even though all that can be done has been done that an entity can still be sued for lack of accessibility or in any case, compliance with someone's idea of accessibility even though the site is accessible. 
I would hope that compliat companies and entities out there who are producing and maintaining web sites are keenly aware that they need not be coerced into meeting someone's idea of accessibility if their site reflects the best of all possible worlds in this regard. 
I mention this because There is a growing sense that a tool alone is the measure of accessibility and defense of that tool by its producers or proponents is growing and because it is education that is important to the process and not the tool we use. 
I know of two instances where the tool is the rule and the tool fails to measure up. 
The tool can also be an entity using or producing or backing a tool. 
Being sued in the United states is not pleasant, but even more unpleasant is being sued even though you have followed someone's guidance in providing a site that is "accessible". 
To this end, we all need to work hard to educate the community towards accessibility which is not defined by the use of a particular tool but that is defined by good practices in site design and development. 
The W3C WWAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v1.0 though having its ambiguities and pitfalls and being open in some cases to interpretation has stood many in good stead in achieving the goals implicit in best practice development. 
The techniques that accompany it and the expertise that has grown up around it has been fenoninal but can be undermined quite easily and soon if the notion that a tool is the end is allowed to flourish and prevail. 
Tools have their place but in the rong hands as we have seen, they can also become weapons of distruction. 
If someone asks you to enter into an agreement with them concerning making your site "accessible", make it clear that what you are buying is at least conformance with the p1 and p2 guidelines of the WCAG. 
In the case of course of the us government, make sure that you are getting a site that complies with section 508. 
The same goes for reviews. 
If someone reviews your site and tells you that it does not meet their specifications but they can help you meet those specifications, ask them instead to provide you with a site review based on either 508 if you are an us federal government entity or WCAG v1.0 p1 and p2. 
If you have been told that your site meets some notion of accessibility, find a way to have it looked at for p1 and p2 checkpoints or 508 even a spot check will do because if it fails, you are leaving someone out.

David, 
Can you provide some specifics on what is prompting these comments? 
I'm not saying I disagree but would like some context for the implication you are raising here of legal action being taken when a site has complied with some metric of accessibility. 
How could a court set damages if no damage was done? 
There is damage though to the reputation of the entity and harm to the entity if there is one envolved who assisted in the development of the site and the list goes on. 
How could a court set damages if no damage was done? 
Apologies to the international list as my reply is grounded in US disability rights-based law. 
In rights-based litigation, damages are found due to the fact that a technical standard for accessibility was violated. 
The fact that the discrimination occurred - even though the entity did not know they did not comply - is grounds for a disability rights claim. 
Traditionally, remedies involve correcting the disability rights violation. 
In other cases, the enforcing agency seeks monetary damages depending on the grievance and provisions of the rights-based statute. 
This is why rights-based statutes like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act tie the entity's receipt of federal funds contingent upon not discriminating against people with disabilities. 
If discrimination occurs, then the federal funding can be immediately withdrawn. 
Now that the State of California has adopted 508 into its State Statutes, the State can withdraw state funding for covered entities that do not comply with Section 508. 
This is because the State statute requires that any entity that directly or indirectly receives funding and does not comply with Section 508- they will lose funding AND still have to correct the violation. 
State law now requires the entity's technology contractor to resolve all complaints on accessibility violations. 
Interesting, isn't it? 
I am leaving today for Nice, France to speak at the Accessibility for All conference, so if there are further comments about my comments, I will not be able to respond until I return in April.

How could a court set damages if no damage was done? 
In the case of SOCOG vs Maguire (the Sydney Olympics case) damages were set based on the fact that Bruce Maguire had suffered by not being able to participate in the general enjoyment of the Olympics. 
This is like 
"pain and suffering" suffered in addition to things that have a clear money value, like loss of earnings or hospital costs, and is well established in law. 
You can read the reasoning of the commissioner in Maguire vs SOCOG online: DD000200.htm - it's a few paragraphs summing up what the problems are and a few about what damage was suffered. 
It doesn't explain exactly how the $20,000 was chosen, but the assumption is that this is consistent with damage assessments in similar cases. 
This case shows another interesting point of Australian disability law: It is designed primarily to solve problems. 
In the case of the ticket books (which was part of Maguire vs SOCOG) the initial finding was that SOCOG should make accessible ticket books and ensure Mr Maguire got one and could get tickets to the Olympics, since a cost of about $20,000 was reasonable given they spent a bit over 7 million dollars on making ticket books. 
This finding is also online, separately, at DD000150.htm 
Note that these are cases in Australia. 
Different countries have different approaches and set wildly different monetary damages in this area. 
In some places there is a strong requirement that damages are set consistently. 
In other places a jury sets damages with very little requirement for consistency. 
In addition there is a concept of "exemplary or punitive damages" which are not really based on the damage done to the individual, but are meant to be a deterrent to people thinking there is no damage. 
Again this is well established in law, although not as common. 
Basically it is the idea that the damage sustained is one thing, but the defendant should pay more than that purely as punishment for their having caused those damages. 
Finally, a court will not award damages if (in the opinion of the court) there has been no damage done. 
Occasionally they will award nominal damages (perhaps one penny), for example to discourage frivolous litigation. 
They may also require costs to be paid as a way of discouraging people from bringing trivial suits. 
(But there are also cases of this tactic being used as a way of sliencing dissent...) cheers chaals

To set these damages Maguire had to be unable to use the site. 
Hence the accessibility problem was real, not determined solely by a tool, checklist or any other theoretical model of accessibility such as David was referring to. 
Yes, My reference has to do with incorrect use of tools and lack of education on the part of some vendors and organizations in leading the way toward broad accessibility. 
For instance, we have discussed the use of the summary tag for lay out tables on this list. 
Sure, using it gets you past some tool or other, but does it really improve accessibility? 
On the other side, When the wcag best practices are followed, should not someone be able to win or avoid a suit by someone because the site perhaps fails a tool or does not carry their certification and they have been turned away from application of that certification? 
What I am aiming at here is to work to provide an awareness as in any venu that there are things to be aware of when making a purchase or making an arrangement with a service providor to provide accessibility services for your organization. 
This grew out of concern that some sites were deemed accessible which did not meet wcag or 508 but the sites in question do not fall into 508 so far. 
I do not want to see someone sued because they spent a ton of money and got organizational approval against getting sued nor do I want to see an organization get sued because they apply the standards, have an accessible site but are not certified by the suing organization. 
The idea that "If you pay me to certify your site I won't sue you" is quite repugnant to me because it limits creativity, lowers the bar and also because someone else may sue if they don't.
