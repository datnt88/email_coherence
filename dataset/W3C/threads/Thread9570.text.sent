2002-11-22#1 janG ensure test cases themselves are named using frag IDs 2002-11-22#2 jang [test case fix] remove RDFS entailment rules from the language-ignored-for-numeric-types cases. 
2002-11-22#3 patH Tie MT datatype to the sec that points out language isn't important to DT entailment (except for rdf:XMLLiteral) 2002-11-22#4 jjc create an example.org 
DT-entailment showing that language is not relevant. 
2002-11-22#5 jjc check that RDF Concepts does not allow a synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral 2002-12-06#2 patH update the rdf:value desc in the semantics doc 2002-12-06#4 jjc Write explicit definition of blank nodes in concepts. 
2002-12-06#6 jang Check the use of rdf:XMLLiteral in the current RDF Semantics editor's draft and its effect on test cases. 
2002-12-06#7 JanG Find the test cases with rdf:RDF issues (we think xml:base ones). 
Find out what the test cases were testing and adddress replacing/deleting or updating as appropriate. 
2002-12-06#8 PatH Produce wording on effective use of closure rules on datatyping (sec 4.3 ?) 2002-12-06#9 janG Check list of testcase actions under item 12 agenda and confirm with bwm that they are all done. 
Ah, forgot that. 
Will do. 
Done Done Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501 (850)291 0667 cell phayes@ai.uwf.edu http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes s.pam@ai.uwf.edu for spam Ive added the following paragraph to the section on datatype interpretations in the Semantics doc. 
(I realized that the current text was not actually accurate, since it said that the generic datatype conditions applied to rdf:XMLLiteral as well as all the others, so Ive tweaked that.) Now, further to the above, what exactly should I link it to??? 
The semantic conditions for the built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral have been described in previous sections; but in a datatyped interpretation, in addition, a graph which contains a literal with a non-well-formed XML string or an illegal language tag, and which is typed with rdf:XMLLiteral is always considered a datatype violation. 
These semantic conditions are exactly similar to [those for other datatypes] if one defines the lexical space of rdf:XMLLiteral as the set all XML documents and all pairs of XML documents and language tags, and L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral)) as XML canonicalization. 
The possible inclusion of language tags makes this a special case, however: in all other cases, RDF ignores any language tags which occur in typed literals.

I'd also put an @@ on it to confirm. 
Looks good but I don't believe I'm a competent judge in this area. 
Brian Referring to: Also refer to the definition of D-interpretation later in the same section, and the subsequent explanatory paragraphs? 
My my mind, that's the bit the primarily defines the semantic conditions for datatyped literals.
