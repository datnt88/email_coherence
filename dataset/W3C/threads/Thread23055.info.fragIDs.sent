<s> In a pure XML context, is it the root element, or the document itself, that receives this event?  </s>
<s> In an (X)HTML context, does the body element get the event?  </s>
<s> If the latter, then how does one attach a load event to a document before the body node has been loaded into the document?  </s>
<s> (As is common with load events, since the document is typically not going to be fully loaded when the event is attached.)  </s>

<s> This has been (hopefully) clarified in the DOM Level 3 Events specification.  </s>
<s> The load event can be dispatch to an Element node:  </s>
<s> Given the compatibility between XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4, the list of possible targets for the load event is: HTMLBodyElement, HTMLFrameSetElement, HTMLObjectElement, HTMLLinkElement, HTMLMetaElement, HTMLScriptElement, HTMLFrameElement, HTMLIFrameElement, HTMLImageElement  </s>
<s> The load event, as defined in HTML 4 using the onload attribute, was designed for the FRAMESET and BODY elements.  </s>
<s> We extended the concept in DOM to address other "objects".  </s>
<s> I believe that your functionality is addressed in the Load and Save module: Events supported by asynchronous DOMBuilder objects are: * load: The document that's being loaded is completely parsed, see the definition of LSLoadEvent * progress: Progress notification, see the definition of LSProgressEvent In other words, the target is not the Document, but the object used to build the Document.  </s>
<s> Correct, it would be good to put it on our errata list for DOM Level 2 Events at some point.  </s>
<s> We are giving priorities to DOM Level 3 for the moment (over DOM Level 1 Second Edition or DOM Level 2 errata).  </s>
