Sean and I spent some time chatting today about EARL and a test point description language. 
Here's the log of the chat. 
I've edited out irrelevant bits. 
21:14:37 wendy sbp: you suggested changing { :Page earl:passes :TestCase } . 
21:14:39 wendy to 21:14:45 wendy [ rdf:subject :Page; rdf:predicate earl:passes; rdf:object :TestCase ] 21:14:52 sbp yep 21:15:15 wendy hmmm. 
could you explain why? 
21:15:39 sbp contexts are kinda special to CWM, and I'd hoped they'd catch on by now. 
But people are still just discussing away, and reification is here to stay. 
Ooh, that rhymes 21:16:14 sbp actually, they just discussed it today on RDF IG 21:16:29 sbp Seth asked Tim if a context with one statment as a member is equivalent to a statement ID 21:16:47 sbp Tim said he stays out of those sort of arguements :-) 21:17:03 sbp so reifying might be better 21:17:16 wendy when you say "I'd hoped they'd catch on" who is they? 
21:17:25 wendy people other than those creating CWM? 21:17:32 wendy you want others to use contexts? 
21:18:16 sbp they: the world and it 21:18:19 sbp and it's dog 21:18:27 wendy :) 21:25:03 wendy so, when are you going to write an EARL validator? 
:) 21:25:13 sbp it only implemented "earl:pass" :-) 21:25:30 sbp EARL Validator: there are two different approaches I could take 21:25:53 sbp 1) Play about with CWM/Llyn 21:26:01 sbp 2) Beg Aaron to work on his RDF API 21:26:08 AaronSw Already on it! 
21:26:15 sbp problem solved 21:26:17 AaronSw Running the unit test now... 21:27:00 sbp we're looking for a CGI form whereby one can paste in a URI, and have it "validate" the EARL 21:27:16 sbp in as much as one can validate an RDF Model. 
Really, you just check it for consistency 21:28:02 sbp which CWM is good at. 
Perhaps I'll try that approach too 21:28:19 wendy hmm. 
i thought it was the syntax we wanted to validate, not the model. 
am i confusing things? 
21:28:41 sbp but I'm a bit saddened by the whole state of EARL at the moment: test case work messing things up, etc. 21:28:50 sbp syntax: just use the RDF Validator for that 21:29:44 sbp with a model validator, you want to check that people are not doing _:Checkpoint earl:passes _:Page . 
or anything silly like that 21:31:36 wendy hmm. the other day you said s/earl:suite/earl:id. but this uses earl:suite. 
21:31:46 wendy or am i switching them? 
21:31:46 sbp oh, feck 21:33:15 sbp I'm not even sure what earl:suite does anymore 21:33:34 sbp I mean, it's meant to link to a set of conformance criteria 21:33:41 sbp e.g. all of WCAG 1.0 21:34:20 sbp but perhaps it would be better to link it to a URI/bNode, and then link all of the IDs off of that. 
Sort of like the machine readable version of WCAG that I drafted up 21:34:28 wendy yes, linking to all of wcag 1.0 could be called a suite, but it's an id. not sure we need to distinguish... 21:34:34 wendy although some of the recent thread gets into that. 
21:34:54 wendy if you want to make a less granular claim you could...but i'm not sure how it would change how it gets processed. 
21:35:08 sbp well, when processing, you need to be explicit 21:35:27 sbp it's not enough to be fuzzy to any degree, you have to state things in incredibly pedantic detail 21:35:34 sbp which is probably why I like it :-) 21:35:53 wendy yes, good to be pendantic. 
but, i'm trying to think of a scenario of how this would be processed differently. 
21:35:54 sbp so using WCAG as a kind of bag may seem good on the surface, but the processor won't know what's in the ba 21:36:08 wendy yes - exactly - unless that bag is defined somewhere... 21:36:14 wendy perhaps suite = WCAG 1.0 21:36:29 wendy WCAG 1.0 is a bag for {set of checkpoint URIs} 21:36:32 sbp and WCAG's annoying, because really it's a bag with three other bags in it, all of the different checkpoints, and you can have overlaps of the bags 21:36:40 wendy actually- 3 bags. 
one for each level of conformance of wcag. 
21:36:41 sbp yep, that's how I wanted to model it 21:36:49 wendy :) exactly. 
21:36:53 sbp :-) 21:37:29 wendy ok. so in this instance i've used an id, but suite should be possible, as long as we have a way to define what is in the suite. 
21:37:43 wendy which, is basically just an rdf:bag. 
21:38:09 sbp DAML lists are considered "cooler" 21:38:26 wendy I don't know anything about DAML, really...could you explain? 
21:38:53 sbp er... it's an ontology. 
so, it's a language which allows you to make other languages with astonishing detail 21:38:59 sbp like a schema language 21:39:18 sbp but it has other little knick knacks in it, like daml:Seq, or whatever it's called 21:39:28 sbp we use DAML a little bit in the EARL schema 21:40:17 wendy yes - that's the only bit of DAML i know is in the EARL schema. 
21:40:57 sbp the schema is at http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil# 
21:41:18 sbp oh, and there's a really good walkthrough: 21:42:25 sbp Any idea what we're going to do about the TPDL? 
I kinda decided all of a sudden that EARL walks a weird tightrope act between linking to a test case, putting up metadata for a test case, and actually defining the test case 21:42:59 sbp Daniel's original properties had a list of test case stuff with a note to enumerate them out later, but we never did, and in the end we lost interest in that aspect and got rid of some of the properties 21:43:15 wendy yes, it is in an odd grey area. 
21:43:19 wendy Not sure what we'll do. 
21:43:22 sbp so we have a kind of semi-pointer/semi-metadata language for test cases in EARL 21:43:26 wendy I expect it will end up in QA. 21:43:40 sbp but the question is: what do we do for EARL? 
21:43:40 wendy BUT, i would like to iron out as much of that as possible before handing off. 
21:43:47 wendy right. 
yes. 
21:44:09 wendy What are your thoughts? 
Add back the properties that were stripped out? 
21:44:47 wendy incorporate parts of Chris/Josh's test case dtd? 
21:45:00 sbp well, if a TPDL lanuage exists at all, it will be separate from EARL. 
Well, IMO it should be separate from EARL. 
Even Al said it would be good as a Semantic WEb project, but I'm damned if I'm going to be able to work on that as well, what with another degree coming up and so forth, so the course for EARL looks a bit shaky 21:45:32 wendy do you think more needs to be stripped from earl to remove the greyness? 
21:45:40 sbp well, the question is whther or not to standardize a TPDL, and then if so, how do we incorporate that into EARL assuming that it doesn't turn out as an RDF language, and if not, how EARL copes with the mess that will be created 21:45:51 sbp I'm not sure if we need to remove stuff, or add it, or what 21:45:59 sbp well... let me slow down a bit... 21:46:06 wendy what was your reaction to Dimitris' post? 
21:46:28 wendy it seemed to me that he was saying the DOM TS ML was specific to DOM and not something to base other test suites on. 
21:47:22 sbp we have the pointer to the test case at the end of the statement. 
That's al;ways going to be there. 
The more sympathetic the test case is to EARL, the less mess we end up with in EARL itself. 
At a level of full compatability iwth EARL (i.e. if TPDL is an RDF language), we can just simply put the URI in the reified triple. 
THat would be the perfect, most wonderful solution that coyld happen, and we can all go for a drink and dance around the maypole 21:47:29 sbp so we're faced with the alternatives... 21:47:53 wendy then there is the test case vs test distinction. 
21:47:57 wendy maypole :) 21:47:59 AaronSw * AaronSw wonders what a TPDL is. 
21:48:05 sbp he said that if TPDL was standardized, that he'd try to move over to it, which I thought was really cool 21:48:14 sbp TPDL - Test Point Definition Langauge 21:48:22 wendy yes, he seems very open to finding an elegant solution. 
21:48:26 AaronSw Ah. 21:48:56 sbp but, that's a lot of work that somebody will have to do. 
The problem with the legant solution is that it takes work away from DOM TS and EARL (good), but heaps it all into a group that will have to be chartered to cope with it, surely 21:49:14 sbp and it's going to be months, if not years, until a good TPDL is created 21:49:23 wendy seems that it is NISTs job. 
21:49:26 wendy they are the experts. 
21:49:32 sbp and even then, it will probably end up being less than compatable with either EARL or DOM TS 21:49:43 sbp yeah, but are NIST keeping an eye on EARL and the DOM TS? 21:49:46 wendy * wendy wonders about large corps that do testing...they must have something...likely proprietary. 
:( 21:50:10 wendy actually, NIST has participated some in DOM TS, but I think are drooling over QA participation. 
21:50:20 wendy thus, expect if it is to happen, it will be in QA. 21:50:21 sbp If QA sat down and did it, it would benefit us. 
if someone else does it, we'll have even more of a headache, waiting for them to finish, and so forth 21:50:30 wendy esp. 
w/DD as one of the leads. 
21:50:45 sbp yeah, absolutely 21:50:53 wendy thus, you and i just need to join QA! help make it happen! 
:) 21:51:19 sbp heh, with all the bundles of free time that we have, eh? :-) 21:51:38 wendy free time. 
:) 21:51:52 AaronSw And the validator folks are joining QA too... it's getting quite popular it seems. 
21:52:14 sbp the problem is, we've been working on EARL for ages and ages now, and with just one more turn of the wheel, it could be basically compltete. 
And now there's the problem of the TPDL, which could be a whole other process... aaargh! 
I just want to get EARL finished 21:53:34 wendy finishing EARL: will it every be? 
:) 21:53:55 wendy TSDL: it would be extremely cool, but it seems part of the second phase. 
21:54:03 wendy there's still tons of work to do for earl. 
21:54:17 sbp yeah, but TPDL should hav come first, and it's coming second! 
21:54:18 wendy most elegant solution includes TSDL, but earl at least makes current situation better. 
21:54:27 wendy hindsight is 20/20. 
21:54:34 sbp yeah, true 21:54:47 wendy we should have thought about users as well as devs, but we focused on devs and now jim ley is upset. 
21:54:52 wendy ya live. 
ya learn. 
21:55:11 sbp and anyway, EARL 0.95 is unimplementable to devs right now 21:55:25 wendy EARL came first, TPDL will come second. 
egg before chicken as it were, I guess. 
21:55:43 sbp yeah 21:56:02 wendy yikes, unimplementable? 
missed ya there. 
what do you mean? 
21:56:06 sbp O.K., so I ask you: what do you want me to do now? 
21:56:12 sbp oh, O.K., hang on... 21:56:28 sbp unimplementable: well, we're going to change it substantially, I hope 21:57:18 sbp there are so many little bits which just bug the crap out of me that we could do with changing now. 
But then there is the resistance from Chaals, which is valuid, and goes something like "we've already learned a lot, we have a lot more to learn" 21:57:35 sbp I had hoped that using RDF for all of this would soften the blow. 
But.. um... it hasn't really 21:57:54 sbp well, it has. 
Just not as much as I would have hoped 21:58:15 wendy the blow of what? 
implementability? 
21:58:20 sbp the 0.9 to 0.95 thing was really cool 21:58:27 sbp the blow of version changes 21:58:32 wendy ah. gotcha. 
21:59:02 sbp now, if we go to 1.0, we are in effect saying "this is done, go implement it" 21:59:26 wendy what was nick's reaction? 
21:59:32 sbp TPDL is threatening, because it means we cannot conceivably come up with the above until we work out how it fits in with EARL 21:59:38 sbp Nick's reaction to what? 
21:59:53 wendy possibly moving to 1.0 in the midst of implementing 0.95. 
22:00:04 sbp oh, I don't think I told him yet :-) 22:00:07 wendy lol 22:00:22 sbp and I should note that it's not that 0.95 is unimplementable... it's that 1.0 will be better 22:00:32 wendy yes. 
gotcha. 
22:00:37 wendy ok, then. 
here's what i know: 22:00:45 wendy 1. we don't have a tpdl yet. 
22:00:58 wendy 2. we want to make sure earl can jive w/tpdl once it exists. 
22:01:06 wendy 3. but we need to go ahead w/earl. 
22:01:15 wendy therefore, i suggest that we anticipate earl 2.0. 
22:01:25 wendy earl 1.0 exists today w/out tpdl. 
22:01:30 wendy once tpdl exists, we modify earl. 
22:01:51 wendy only problem then is need to make sure all earl 1.0 data doesn't go stale 22:02:01 wendy and that there is some sort of easy migration like from 0.9 to 0.95 22:02:01 sbp * sbp sobs 22:02:19 sbp 0.9 to 0.95 was easy 'cause we just bugfixed it 22:02:37 sbp 1.0 to 2.0 will be scary 22:02:55 wendy but not impossible? 
22:03:14 sbp as long as no data is added, no. it's not impossible 22:03:40 wendy and, data is likely to be added in 2.0 to jive w/tpdl. 
22:03:43 wendy right? 
22:04:01 sbp I'm not sure what TPDL is (it doesn't exist yet), so I can't say for sure 22:04:02 wendy :) 22:04:07 sbp :-) 22:04:26 wendy how difficult would it be to come up with a skeleton of what tpdl might look like? 
22:04:32 wendy earl took a while since we were all learning. 
22:04:41 wendy tpdl might be easier since we've done some of this. 
22:05:03 wendy but, i still think tpdl is best owned by qa. 22:05:16 sbp yes, I agree. 
You'd have to ask them, I guess 22:05:17 wendy therefore, perhaps we try to get this on the qa agenda for their upcoming f2f? 
22:05:38 sbp oh, absolutely! 
22:05:44 wendy hmmm. 
22:06:00 wendy * wendy figures out how to fit in tpdl into w3.org/2001/10/22-earl-uaag/all.htm 22:06:19 sbp let QA do it :-) 22:06:21 wendy this was supposed to be my slideset for a presentation to the UA WG on monday, but i think it will be a more genearl resource. 
22:06:35 sbp it's a really good little page 22:06:45 wendy well, but i think we can offer some wisdom to get them started. 
22:06:51 wendy we've been thinking about this for quite a while! 
:) 22:06:55 wendy thx. 
22:07:03 sbp so, WCAG would have to create test point stuff. 
How do you feel about that? 
22:07:18 wendy we already are and we need to do it. 
22:07:27 wendy WCAG needs to be less ambiguous. 
22:07:35 wendy AERT was born b/c of the ambiguities. 
22:07:45 wendy it should have come from WCAG in the first place. 
22:07:48 sbp well, a TPDL would both help and hinder GL as much as ERT, right? 
22:07:59 wendy yes. 
22:08:05 sbp yep, I certainly agree with that 22:08:31 wendy also would help UA WG as working on test suite for UAAG's CR. 22:08:36 wendy and XAG's CR 22:08:44 sbp perhaps I'll look in my mailbox, and someone will have sent me a specification for a decent TPDL langauge in RDF? 
22:08:48 sbp * sbp checks his mail 22:08:51 wendy :) 22:08:59 sbp nah, oh well 22:09:05 sbp sorry, you were saying? 
:-) 22:09:21 sbp XAG's CR... oh, man... dependencies! 
22:09:32 sbp we should have done TPDL first! 
22:09:41 wendy lol 22:09:49 sbp no, seriously! 
EARL would have been just chaff then 22:15:43 wendy well, i'll write up some stuff on the tpdl and include it in this thing i'm working on. 
22:15:48 sbp actually, that's your decision 22:15:55 sbp what should I do next for ERT? 22:16:09 wendy well, hmmm. 
22:16:24 wendy i'm primarily concerned about what we are going to tell WCAG about using EARL on sites. 
22:16:45 wendy so, any help with that would be good. 
22:17:05 sbp just make something up! 
that's what I do 22:17:05 wendy secondly, i'm still real interested in what bugs you about 0.95 and how you would move to 1.0. 
22:17:20 wendy that whole thing we discussed on monday. 
22:17:32 wendy :) 22:17:36 sbp well, for a start: bug with 1.0: how do we make conformance claims about a whole site? 
22:17:46 wendy yes. 
that needs attention. 
22:17:49 sbp s/1.0/0.95 22:17:59 wendy yes, that's how i read it :) 22:18:18 sbp well, we could nick CWM's stuff for 0.95, or add something specialized to EARL 1.0 22:18:30 sbp s/or/and\/or/ 22:18:46 sbp [[[ 22:18:46 sbp It could be, for example:- 22:18:46 sbp _:a earl:testSubject _:b . 
22:18:46 sbp _:b log:uri [ log:startsWith "http://example.org/" 
] . 
22:18:46 sbp It may turn out that we add some terms in the EARL 1.0 vocabulary to offer 22:18:47 sbp a "standardized solution" for this. 
22:18:49 sbp ]]] 22:20:22 sbp ah, we could even say 22:20:53 sbp _:x a earl:Site; earl:testSubject http://example.org/ . 
# would that work? 
22:21:03 wendy sbp: what terms do you think we would need to add in EARL 1.0? 
"applies-across-domain" or "starts-at-base-uri" or stuff like that? 
22:21:06 sbp Aaron: would it be valid to say that? 
22:21:26 AaronSw It's well-formed RDF. 
22:21:43 sbp yeah, we could add loads of stuff. 
I dunno why we were so conservative before: we should just add stuff 'till the schema explodes 22:21:51 wendy lol 22:22:09 sbp it doesn't matter if we add stuff and it's useless. 
It totally stuffs us if we don't add something and find we need it later on 22:22:49 wendy * wendy considers how this would tie in w/html... 22:22:53 sbp for example... if I wanted to use a single page as a test case, I'd do... oh actually no, I don't think it does make sense 22:23:13 sbp tie in with HTML? 
22:23:22 wendy well... 22:23:35 wendy lots of straws here... HTML base element... 22:23:45 sbp unless we created a new disjoint class. 
Ooh, that might work 22:23:58 sbp HTML base element? 
22:24:27 wendy hmm. 
no nothing there. 
22:25:12 wendy there are two pieces that we need to look at here on out: 22:25:18 wendy 1. how the earl is structured 22:25:26 wendy 2. how the html references it 22:25:34 wendy keep in mind the following scenario: 22:26:02 wendy search engine ferrets out a set of pages that seem to fit the user's query then prioritizes them based on EARL. 
22:26:14 wendy based on EARL compared to user preferences. 
22:26:24 wendy hmmm. 
wonder if that means we would be keeping user preferences in EARL? 
22:27:03 wendy or rather what is the earl model (rather than how structured) 22:27:24 sbp note to self: split :TestSubject up into smaller pairwise disjoint classes, restrict :testCase so that the domain is a union of those classes, spend ages telling people why I hacked it that way 22:28:02 sbp Wendy: example user's query? 
22:29:28 wendy a user has uses a search engine (SE). 
SE knows that the user needs text equivalents (WCAG 1.0 cp 1.1) 22:29:50 wendy SE searches database for user's query "rdf api tests" it finds several pages, but puts highest 22:30:02 wendy priority on this one that claims it conforms to WCAG 1.0 cp 1.1 22:30:09 wendy not the most compelling example... 22:30:40 wendy the user could also say, "don't show me sites that don't make a claim, since they'll likely be useless to me." 22:30:44 sbp ah, I get it now. 
No, you're right 22:31:15 wendy about which part - user prefs in EARL? 
22:31:53 sbp er... the preferences file would be something like a filter in whatever you're using to process the EARL, which in this case in the SE. 
The filters would be in whatever query/inference language the SE implements, which is annoying... standardized inference language, please! 
22:32:08 sbp did I get that right? 
22:33:45 wendy sounds reasonable, although I don't know that much about SEs. 22:33:46 sbp neither do I 22:33:59 wendy know anyone who does? 
22:34:10 sbp Nick, perhaps? 
22:34:24 wendy worth a shot. 
22:34:30 wendy we ought to take this to the list for discussion. 
wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa we I should've always explained myself better, what exasperates me, is you've all put a lot of effort into EARL, and come up with what seems a good technical solution (I'm not completely up on RDF, but can pretty much grok what seems to be going on.) The problem was that I suddenly discover that you don't seem to be too sure what EARL is the technical solution to. 
Too much technical work has gone on, without the user implications being fully thought through. 
I've been in projects like this, I'm technical and I've learnt from my hard learnt mistakes, this has led to me wasting lots of my time, I hope none of EARL has been wasted. 
By the way, in case people wonder why I'm reading/posting, I have an Evaluation tool (on the use of scripts), creating an extension to my browser that uses EARL reports. 
conformance Definition of site needed? 
I'm assuming domain, but I don't think that's safe, too many "sites" are widely spread with what are really subsites within them, for example Government sites have often only made part of their sites fully accessible and different departments with different criteria are still running off the same www.ukonline.gov.uk so this by domain wouldn't be appropriate. 
By startsWith, I assume you mean that to be a url fragment? 
so log:startsWith "http://example.org/chickens/" would refer to http://example.org/chickens/bantam.html but not don't My own personal direction with this would not be in the search engine, but would be in the user agent, so is more generic, I can apply it to any page of links, (for example a list of where to learn more about HTML authoring, I can prioritise those to the ones that have provided EARL.) I already have something similar, I currently check that links aren't 404's and also get the file size and content type, and even this minimal information is improving my search efficiency. 
EARL would open this up to further areas. 
It may be nice to have it as wide as possible, so it therefore is as useful to as many people, whatever their accessibility interest. 
Okay I've also thought of some "Opportunities" for EARL's links to HTML: I have a site, it provides presentations online - Generally it only provides Graphic Slides (without description) and Audio, so is in general pretty inaccessible - this is for simple cost reasons and there's a limited audience (it's a hosted service we generally have nothing to do with the production, they just phone the computer.) 
So I'd have to say them we have the material available to provide descriptions on the images, closed captions on the audio etc. etc. and would want to let the users know, but would still not want to go to the effort of individually stating the checks on all pages (I assume it's not a proposal that you have to manually check each page when they are all generated from a similar template?) What solutions could there be in EARL for this? 
My own thoughts were an EARL "testPage" that just referred to a "template" or "sample" or "class" or something I don't know the word, but this class of testpage could then be referred to throughout the site and linked to with a LINK element. 
This would let you create a series of "classes" being different Accessibility successes, and then reference them from anywhere on your site, without worrying about the urls in the EARL. 
I realise this is slightly away from EARL's current use, but I think it would be a solution to using it on sites. 
Then of course there's non HTML resources, how do we link EARL to them, here I think a robots.txt 
idea whereby EARL specifies URL fragments and types say "PDF's in /documents/" and has the report for these. 
Unless we go down the compact privacy solution and there's an HTTP option for specifying it here. 
Okay that's about it on my thoughts at the moment... Jim. 
I think that's unavoidable in any project of this nature :-) But on the whole I think we've been doing fairly well... 7/10? 
All input is welcome though, and we received only scraps of feedback for nearly a year now... 
I know that some people have questioned various aspects of EARL development, and yet I am also aware that the feedback from those people has been low. 
I can't understand why that is so! 
A couple of notes:- a) I meant "0.95". 
b) I didn't really mean bug: as I noted, it can be done, we just haven't really settled the technology at that layer yet. 
Side-effect of the top down approach? 
That's my excuse, and I'm sticking to it :-) Clearly. 
The problem as ever is deciding how much power we want EARL to have. 
It could have incredible power, stating that all pages from a site with a certain extension in a certain folder are excluded, but that all others matching a certain RegExp are included, with priority levels and so on... there's always the question of how far we go, trading of expressiveness of the language for the sake of implementation. 
Of course, we also strive to make it extensible, and although it clearly is, it's difficult at this stage of the evolution of RDF to settle things down. 
Yes. 
What you're doing in essence there is "typing" the page, which is fine. 
You don't even have to have that information in the page; you can have it, annotation style, in a third party database. 
As usual, there are about 5 different ways in which one could approach the situation, which acceptable results. 
It needs someone to weigh them all up against each other and say "this is how it's going to be". 
The problem with link types is that HTML is messy in that department. 
So I'd prefer the remote typing solution, but perhaps that wouldn't be as viable to people who just want to go into their pages and say "this one is marked"? 
But then, it might be more sensible to try to get them to do it the other way.
