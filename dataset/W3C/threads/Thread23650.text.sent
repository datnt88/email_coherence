Hello! I've been using your service for a long time, and yesterday I made a request as a postscript (a web page as a postcript: I think this will save the pictures, won't it?) The problem is that the returned postscript is not valid! 
I tried to open it with several programs (GhostScript, I even tried to convert it to other format -pdf-) but I get an error message! 
Am I doing something wrong, or is it a bug? 
Note that I tested several sites, and noone was successfully sent. 
Yours, Fernando Rodriguez I detect this problem yesterday, when I request a page in this format. 
I'm using Adobe Acrobat to read PS file and It fail.

Try opening the file in a text editor and see what it contains.. My guess is that it probably contains an error message. 
BTW which server do you use? 
Thanks Clement Onime
