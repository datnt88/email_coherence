Before it isn't too late (i.e. today), please look over the responses I (and some others) have made to the issues raised since IETF last call. 
I have begun preparation of the draft, and it will be soon too late to make any changes. 
With some luck, this will be the draft that goes to DRAFT Standard; I'd hate to have made some mistake that would require another draft, and it is up to you to make sure I don't (other than a mechanical editing mistake, for which I am alone responsible). 
I REALLY want to get a draft in for the ID draft cutoff, and get this to bed. 
There are a number of issues that still should have some final discussion. 
These include: ADAMS3 ADAMS31 ADAMS84 ADAMS84b ADAMS88 Please look at these in particular, and my previous responses, while there is time. 
I don't know if I will get to all of the nits in ADAMS3 in time; I did look at the ones that Glenn said were significant and respond to them. 
Thank you all for your contributions to the HTTP working group. 
You editor, Jim Gettys 
I'm very satisfied with the state of affairs as reflected in the issues list today (Wednesday - sorry Jim!). Nice work, as usual. 
There is one question I'm aware of (because I raised it ;-) ) that doesn't appear on the issues list and hasn't provoked any traffic on this list. 
It has to do with the general syntax of headers and a change between HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 that appears accidental. 
See It's not by any means a show-stopper, but if it was accidentally missed I'd like to see it addressed. 
If it was intentionally omitted, that's not going to give me any heartburn.

ID draft deadline was at 5:00PM. 
I made it... To late.... I'll issue an announcement of "come and get it" as soon as the files get installed in the Web. 
Probably in the next day or two.
