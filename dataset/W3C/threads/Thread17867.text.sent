Hello, Per my action item of the 11 April face-to-face [1], please consider this editorial clarification to checkpoint 10.9: Allow the user to configure the arrangement of graphical user agent user interface controls. 
For graphical user interfaces, allow the user to configure the arrangement of user interface controls. 
I would note that the minimal requirement of this checkpoint is unclear.

And if it isn't, there is probably a disability that needs rearrangement in a special way (conflicting with other accessibility needs). 
This might give a clue as to what the minimum requirement must be.

People with different types of disability may need different control interfaces. 
For example, a person with limited ROM might want the frequent controls close together. 
A person with poor motor control might want them farther apart. 
Allowing the user to configure the location of controls allows both users to create an interface that works for them. 
(By the way, a "skin creator" feature would probably meet this requirement, and be a mass-market feature as well.) Denis Behalf Of Hans Riesebos Strange that I never saw this before, but isn't this a repair strategy for a badly designed UI of the UA!?
