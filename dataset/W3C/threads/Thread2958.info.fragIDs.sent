<s> Hi! I have a client application which is running behind a proxy server.  </s>
<s> I want to connect to another server application in another domain.I  </s>
<s> am using Http to connect to the server.The  </s>
<s> problem is how do I pass the information across the proxy to the server and get the response back.I have read of CONNECT method in the Request header, but don't know how to implement it.  </s>
<s> What I could get from reading isStep 1: Send a http request to the proxy with only CONNECT method i.e. the header will only contain connect method and nothing elseStep 2 : Receive the response from the serverStep 3: Send the Get request to the server, containing other fields as host, Accept etcStep 4: Receive the response from the server Is my thinking correct.  </s>
<s> Can you suggest me something on the same.  </s>

<s> Bingo.  </s>
<s> A bit of googling should have given you: or: Anyway your idea seems correct.  </s>
<s> 1) Client sends a requests with the method CONNECT, the request can be a full request so there may be some headers folliwing the request-line.  </s>
<s> 2) The proxy can send a response with response code 200 (which means that there is a tunnel ready to be used.  </s>
<s> The proxy could also send a response with a 4xx or 5xx code which means that you can not use the proxy as a tunnel.  </s>
<s> 3) If the response was a 200, send data, and read data as you want, the proxy will not interfere (you should not have to care about the proxy anymore).  </s>
<s> The proxy will close connections when they are closed by either the client or the server.  </s>
<s> Things to consider: *) Does the proxy allow you to tunnel data to the ports you want?  </s>
<s> Since connect can be used to connect to all ports, many proxies will only allow connects to some ports (like 443 for https).  </s>

<s> Have I missed something?  </s>
<s> Are the answers that propose CONNECT over-thinking the question?  </s>
<s> To connect to an HTTP application through a proxy, send an absolute URI (RFC 2616) to the proxy.  </s>
<s> For example, if the application server is app.com and the proxy server is proxy.com,  </s>
<s> send this request to proxy.com:  </s>
<s> GET http://app.com/the-rest-of-the-URI  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: app.com [more headers]  </s>

<s> I'm assuming his idea was to tunnel and use the connection for something else... but you may be right.  </s>
