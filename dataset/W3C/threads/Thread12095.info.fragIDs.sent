<s> This is Jan's evaluation of Dreamweaver 4. I haven't done a lot of testing beyond that, but I have had a play with the Accessibility checkers provided as extensions.  </s>
<s> Macromedia's original one did about the same set of checks that Bobby does, and that is all.  </s>
<s> As I recall it doesn't include anything about manual checking.  </s>
<s> The UsableNet extension claims to check for all WCAG 1.0 priority 1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> It seems to do a lot of useful testing - I don't know if it does all the checkpoints but I don't yet see that it doesn't.  </s>
<s> It also provides a basic repair functionality - takes you to the relevant bit of the document and highlights the problem, with smoe explanation of how to repair it (or what to check, in cases where it relies on a manual check).  </s>
<s> Again, I haven't tested it rigourously, but it appears on first glance to meet the claim, that it covers priority 1 checkpoints of WCAG.  </s>
<s> If this is the case, then Dreamweaver 4 with the accessibility checker from UsableNet would meet Checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2 to level A. I am also told that Dreamweaver implements MSAA to try and provide access to assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Since I use a Macintosh, I haven't been able to test that at all.  </s>
<s> In order to produce valid HTML 4 Dreamweaver needs to have the "add Doctype" extension - without a doctype declared the only HTML spec that can be validly met is HTML 2.  </s>
<s> In order to produce XHTML (the latest recommendation) a similar extension would need to be added - but it should only be a very simple one to produce.  </s>
<s> If it is used with a validating browser as a preview browser (for example iCab, on the Mac) it can also validate.  </s>
<s> It uses blockquote to indent/outdent, which is not too cool... cheers Charles  </s>
<s> That's common misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> HTML 2.0 specification [1] does require conforming documents to start with a DOCTYPE declaration.  </s>
<s> Here's an excerpt: 3.3.  </s>
<s> HTML Public Text Identifiers To identify information as an HTML document conforming to this specification, each document must start with one of the following document type declarations.  </s>
<s> This document type declaration refers to the HTML DTD in 9.1, "HTML DTD".  </s>
<s> NOTE - If the body of a `text/html' message entity does not begin with a document type declaration, an HTML user agent should infer the above document type declaration.  </s>
<s> The above note is for _user agents_, not for _documents_.  </s>
<s> Besides, this behavior is no longer recommended.  </s>
<s> See [2] for details.  </s>

<s> Aah. Thanks.  </s>
<s> (So the answer is that it needs the "addDoctype" extension to produce valid documents.) cheers Charles  </s>
