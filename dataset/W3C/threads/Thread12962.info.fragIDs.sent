<s> EOWG: There is now an updated and copy-edited version of "Why Standards  </s>

<s> discussion at our 7 May teleconference and on the EOWG list following the meeting.  </s>
<s> It incorporates almost all the change requests from recent EOWG meetings, though a few change requests need additional discussion: Most sections have been significantly copy-edited for readability and flow, but with no substantial changes in meaning.  </s>
<s> This is likely close to its final form, so please review it carefully over the next few days.  </s>
<s> Note that this is still not intended for circulation, but should be soon.  </s>
