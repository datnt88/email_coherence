<s> OK I have a question - Section 6.4.4 is called "structuring documents" I've read the entire document again to try and figure out what kind of documents this refers to.  </s>
<s> Anyone have an idea?  </s>
<s> Are we talking SOAP documents?  </s>
<s> That doesn't make sense in the context.  </s>
<s> Are we talking about documents provided by the service?  </s>
<s> I envision a discussion of recommending XML format (in non-recommendation verbiage) and talking about i18n-related information within such a document.  </s>
<s> But, that seems a little too much like i18n primer material.  </s>
<s> So I figure I must be missing the point here.  </s>
<s> Here's a stab at section 6.6.1 - it's a little pedestrian.  </s>
<s> I'll try and come up with something a little more creative, but I guess I'm not overly inspired.  </s>
<s> If someone has an idea for a scenario, I'm happy to write it up.  </s>
<s> 6.6.1 Times and Time Zones Time handling in Web services is usually affected by time zones.  </s>
<s> However, there is no standard parameter to indicate the time zone.  </s>
<s> Locales are not useful for determining time zone because there can be many time zones within a given locale.  </s>
<s> Scenario A: A Web service returns the current time of a city listed as part of the request.  </s>
<s> The requester sends the name of a city (with an xml:lang tag) and the provider returns the current time in that city formatted in ISO 8601 format (hh:mm:ss).  </s>
<s> Scenario B: A Web service takes a date/time value in ISO 8601 format (yyyymmddThhmm+hhmm) and the name of a city with an xml:lang tag, and returns the value converted to the specified city's time.  </s>
<s> Scenario C: As a sub-process of a calendar service, a Web service inspects multiple calendars looking for mutually available time slots.  </s>
<s> The requester provides a span of time in ISO 8601 format (yyyymmddThhmm+hhmm) using a start time and an end time.  </s>
<s> The inspected calendars store information about their time zones.  </s>
<s> The service returns a series of time spans in the ISO 8601 format.  </s>
<s> I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone.  </s>
<s> My wish has come true.  </s>
<s> I no longer know how to use my telephone.  </s>

<s> Hi Andrea, You're first with your assignments!  </s>
<s> Thanks!! I think the word 'documents' in USWD means explicitly SOAP documents or their WSDL analogs.  </s>
<s> In this case, it probably really means 'types' such as those described by WSDL (see http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#eii-types).  </s>
<s> This may actually be a deep topic; too deep to really deal with here?  </s>
<s> Designing internationalized data structures would make a good book length topic :-).  </s>
<s> The timezone examples are fine.  </s>
<s> To be honest, I think we need to decide just how much i18n primer we're going to provide in the finished document.  </s>
<s> The timezone material seems important to mention.  </s>
<s> In depth coverage here might be too much to ask for.  </s>

<s> It is not a feature.  </s>
<s> OK so, in thinking about SOAP doc structures, I would think about the things we recommend putting in the header and those we recommend putting in the body.  </s>
<s> BUt we talk about that elsewhere in the USD.  </s>
<s> Are we just trying to consolidate the info?  </s>
<s> If we're looking for specifics and examples of SOAP and WSDL docs done in an i18n-sensitive way, then it's going to take me a long time, since these are documents I never generate.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to slog through the WSDL spec right now, but I don't think I'll have a firm enough grasp in time to get this done.  </s>
<s> I'll focus on my other 2 sections for now.  </s>
