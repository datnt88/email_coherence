Having taken a vacation this last week, both physically and from the net, I've had time to consider the issues related to accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities. 
One key question I've been wrestling with has been "is this different than enabling access for people with other disabilities (e.g. those with mobility/dexterity, vision, or hearing impairments), and if so, why is this different?" 
It certainly has *felt* different to me, and so I've had to consider why exactly that difference may be. 
Here's what I concluded: When creating a web page that can be used by people with other disabilities, we are not making the page -directly- accessible to them, we are making the page accessible to their assistive technologies. 
For example, when I create a page that can be used by someone who is unable to see, I am not actually creating the sound files and sound-based navigation structure she needs in order to achieve accessibility; instead, I am ensuring that my page interacts properly with her screenreader and/or specialized web browser that can provide for her what she needs. 
To enable access for a user without mousing ability, I don't have to write a keyboard driver or explicitly program a javascript keyboard-based interface for my page; I simply need to make it compatible with the user's assistive technology. 
However, when dealing with people with cognitive disabilities, I'm not dealing with the assistive technology -- instead, I've got to make the page *directly accessible* to the user. 
This puts me in the position not of a web designer seeking to make his page interoperable with someone's access device, but instead, one meta-level *up* -- I -am- designing their assistive technology! 
I believe this helps explain many of the problems faced by the Web Accessibility Initiative regarding the issues related to CD accessibility -- putting us in the position of directly creating the interfaces. 
An analogous situation would be if the WAI were trying to design a screenreader or voicing browser. 
(Now, the WAI -does- suggest requirements for web browsers -- but that's generally been done in the User Agent working group...) This line of thought led me on to the question (as long as I'm being asked to be an accessible interface designer!) of: If I were creating a browser or other designed to enable web access for people with cognitive disabilities, what would that browser be like? 
Now, of course, there's a need for a breakdown of "people with cognitive disabilities" into smaller groups, because as we know, that grouping covers a pretty broad range of disability types. 
And I personally don't have the expertise to describe their needs or how to meet them, but I can suggest some ways in which various theoretical needs may be met. 
PRODUCT SPEC: CogWeb 1.0 This describes a theoretical user agent, CogWeb 1.0, created to meet the needs of users with cognitive disabilities. 
* Screenreader Compatibility: CogWeb interfaces with any screenreader or accessibility technologies installed in the user's operating system, allowing for words, phrases, and web pages to be read out loud to enable access for non-readers. 
A button on the toolbar allows for the current highlighted text to be read out loud. 
* Graphical Icon Library: At the user's request, CogWeb will include additional graphics when displaying a web page. 
These graphics will be chosen from a large (5,000 images or so) library of images that come with the CogWeb program. 
AI-style text analysis allows for subtle differences in context and meaning to be expressed. 
The text of each icon appears below the icon a la "Ruby." 
Web designers can also specify their own image sets and/or embed graphic "hints" for unknown words. 
* Definition Engine: A powerful context-sensitive English dictionary -- written at a relatively low reading level (say, a children's dictionary) -- allows the user to select a word and then click on the "define" button. 
The definition is either popped up in a new window or read out loud, according to the user's needs and desires. 
* Page Layout Simplification: By restructuring the display of web pages, CogWeb makes comprehension of a site simpler and easier to navigate. 
Content analysis identifies the navigation components of the page, unstacks overly confusing layouts (such as overuse of tables), and builds simplified navigation schemes, such as graphically-labeled "next" and "previous" buttons in the toolbar that allow for standardized access to site contents across a variety of sites. 
Okay, so if this is my theoretical assistive technology device -- how do I, as a web designer, provide the information it needs in order to present an accessible view of a page to someone? 
Here's some techniques I'll have to keep in mind: * Follow the methods (such as ALT text for images, etc) that enable screenreader access to my content. 
* Identify long words and mark them up with either the URI of an icon or a list of related words/concepts: span cog:uri="http://www.kynn.com/icons/tibmastiff.gif" 
Tibetan Mastiff /span span cog:keywords="dog, fuzzy, black, large, guard, pet" Tibetan Mastiff /span This allows CogWeb to either download and display the icon (which must be 100 x 100 pixels in size), or to choose the best icon from the graphics library that matches the keyword -- for example, choosing a larger black dog icon (say, a Newfoundland) instead of a smaller, white dog (poodle). 
* Designate at least one additional web-based dictionary on pages that use complex language (dictionaries defined in an XML-based markup syntax): Identify words or phrases that might be problematic and provide links to definitions; as well, list alternative text definitions inline: span cog:lexicon="http://www.dogshow.com/vdslex.xml#catalog" 
cog:def="pictures of dogs"  Catalog /span * Create pages where the navigation scheme is explicitly designated in the markup; use the link elements and the rel/rev attributes to designate relationships between pages in a collection. 
These relationships are displayed on the tool bar -- see iCab for an idea of how this may be done. 
* Design pages which degrade gracefully when tables are removed and which allow for linearization of content. 
What do you think about this -style of approach- to the situation? 
How offensive is it to suggest that the solution is to work with rather than create the assistive technology? 
If that's a viable approach -- who, if anyone, is working on the research and development of tools especially for our CD friends? 
(In my opinion, it's not reasonable to put the entire burden of providing accessibility to people with CD on the shoulders of web designers!) Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://www.kynn.com/

Kynn, Hope you enjoyed your vacation. 
I can see you did a lot of thinking. 
There are many good ideas that could be suggested to developers of browsers so that a browser can be created to be used by those with the most text-limited cognitive disabilities. 
But, in addressing this extreme end of those in this category, you have neglected the very real and very easily-do-able recommendation for web designers to illustrate their pages/sites because many with disabilities in cognition, language, etc., need them. 
Your solutions still heavily depend on text which is the problem. 
It is much easier for everyone involved if web designers put some attention to illustrating their sites, at least enough to allow effective navigation of sites. 
The person designing the web is in a much better position to know, locate, and connect what will illustrate the actual theme/main idea of the page, than to set up some limited data base of icons that won't likely be available to those who depend on tv web reception anyway ... Incidently, providing support for tv web delivery (no choice of browser, no speech) would be providing support for an "assistive technology" which is used by folks I know with a CD. 
Not all of them, just as all visually impaired folks don't use old comuters.

What is it? 
Uh, okay. 
I guess this explains some of our recent threads? 
Well, I like to think that there's room for both types of people, those who want the world to make sense, and those who don't. 
I fall *squarely* in the first camp. 
I want the world to make sense to the point of wanting the world to be inherently fair, just, and kind. 
I know it's a lost cause. 
But I try anyway.
