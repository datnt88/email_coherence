<s> It must be "everything that does not begin with the LE BOM is big-endian".  </s>
<s> One might add a note that UTF-32 with a little-endian BOM could appear to have a UTF-16 LE BOM because that is a subset.  </s>
<s> The UTF-32 registration might specify that FF FE 00 00 is UTF-32 (little-endian), and that FF FE xx xx with not both xx bytes 00 is UTF-16 (little-endian).  </s>

<s> We deliberately introduced the term UTF-32 since this regularizes the notation for everyone.  </s>
<s> Little is to be gained by using a mixed notation in that section using UTF-8, UTF-16 and UCS-4 together.  </s>
<s> If you would like to fix the 10646 spec, you could propose that the term UTF-32 is formally added there as well.  </s>
<s> As it stands, 10646 has an unfortunate asymmetry in notation that is cumbersome to use for the non-specialist.  </s>
