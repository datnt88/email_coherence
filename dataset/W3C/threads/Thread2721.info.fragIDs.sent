<s> Is there a good reason why WWW-Authenticate can have multiple challenges while Proxy-Authenticate can't?  </s>
<s> draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03:  </s>
<s> Proxy-Authenticate = "Proxy-Authenticate" ":" challenge WWW-Authenticate = "WWW-Authenticate" ":" 1#challenge  </s>
<s> I also think that the following sentence from the description of WWW-Authenticate fits better if moved to the draft-ietf-http-authentication  </s>
<s> document as it is the one that define "challenge".  </s>
<s> User agents MUST take special care in parsing the WWW-Authenticate field value if it contains more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, since the contents of a challenge may itself contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters.  </s>

<s> none.  </s>
<s> Just forgot to update the one when I was updating the other.  </s>
<s> I'll fix it in the next draft.  </s>
<s> BTW: there isn't any good reason not to have multuple challenges for the same mechanism, either (with different realms).  </s>
<s> Jim: can we log this an an issue?  </s>
