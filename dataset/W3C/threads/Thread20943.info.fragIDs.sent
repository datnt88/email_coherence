<s> Yes we came back in our implementation because many CSS files use upper case in selectors following examples provided in http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ even if these CSS files apply to XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> What do you suggest?  </s>
<s> To propose a CSS profile in Amaya?  </s>

<s> Implement it correctly.  </s>
<s> Trying to accommodate bad practice won't promote interoperability in the long run.  </s>
<s> This bug effectively kills an attempt to use the same style sheet with different rules for HTML and XHTML, using different case for selectors.  </s>
<s> Note that I'm only talking about XHTML/XML documents served as XML.  </s>
<s> It's OK to treat selectors case-insensitively when an XHTML document is served as 'text/html'.  </s>
