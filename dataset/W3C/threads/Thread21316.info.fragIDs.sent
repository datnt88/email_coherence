<s> Hi All, In response to Dan's challenge, here is a SOAP server and client for the query engine.  </s>
<s> At the moment, it only lets you query by file name (can be a local file name, or an HTTP URI), but it works alright.  </s>
<s> I had to modify query.py a little so that it would run using a SOAP interface (I have not added the other changes that need to be done yet).  </s>
<s> Aaron, could you bung it in CVS please?  </s>
<s> It's attached as query.py  .  </s>
<s> As for the server and client, the server is attached as query-server.py   </s>
<s> , and runs with:- python query-server.py   </s>
<s> errors.html  </s>
<s> Further to the attached query.py,  </s>
<s> you'll need rdfapi.py,  </s>
<s> ntriples.py  </s>
<s> to run it, available from CVS [1], and of course SOAP.py.  </s>
<s> To run the client, which is attached as  query-client.py   </s>
<s> , load up the server, and try:- python query-client.py   </s>
<s> output.n3 for the built in test (which runs over the Web), and:- python query-client.py  </s>
<s> URIa URIb  output.n3 for your own query.  </s>
<s> As query.py gets updated, more features may follow.  </s>

<s> Done.  </s>
<s> My distaste for SOAP's abuse of WebArch in this instance  </s>
<s> prevents me from committing the client and server stuff.  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Agreed, but it was a fun hack :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>

<s> O.K., so it veritably sucked... not only did it use POST instead of GET, but it used it over a non-CGI based server.  </s>
<s> Well, to make up for that, find attached a proper CGI  query.cgi  of about half the size, that works just as well, and runs in an ordinary browser.  </s>
<s> There, now you can relax Aaron... or should I say REST?  </s>
