<s> Joe -- I like it, I think.  </s>
<s> Agreed regarding the sentence construction.  </s>
<s> I think we also need an explanation of what we're talking about here, too.  </s>
<s> Is this the checkpoint that covers: This page has been updated.  </s>
<s> You will be automatically taken to the new page in 5 seconds, or if that doesn't happen, you can follow the link below: Go to the new address In such cases our advice is likely either (a) just use automatic redirects (i.e. in the HTTP headers), or (b) remove the automatic forward and just leave the link.  </s>
<s> We don't necessarily want to suggest that a button which says "add 10 seconds" is going to be better, and that may be how some people might interpret this.  </s>
<s> We may have multiple cases here with different suggestions and success criteria, which may be a good measure of when we need to break into more than one checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Your thoughts on this?  </s>

<s> Hi Joe Can you think of a another work for expiry.  </s>
<s> Synonyms I found were "expiration" and "termination" Substituting "expiration" I get For events whose expiration depends on user actions.....  </s>
<s> Is that what you meant?  </s>
<s> If so then I don?t think it is getting at the same thing as was covered in the previous item.  </s>
<s> Most of the time, the problem is events that expire without user action.  </s>
<s> Rather they expire because of a time limit.  </s>
<s> In some cases the time limit is a period of time in which the user has to act or a default selection is made for them.  </s>
<s> In other cases, it is a time which they are given to comprehend something before it is removed.  </s>
<s> Could you try a reword to encompass these?  </s>
<s> Also in the second part you suggest warning them when the event expires.  </s>
<s> Did you mean alert them when the event expires or warn them that the event is going to expire?  </s>
