<s> Can the TDL / S authors say something about where they see how the xml:lang attribute will appear in the data type models.  </s>
<s> Use this pseudo N-triples to talk about language-enabled literals: "foo"(en) "foo" - no language Thanks Dave  </s>
<s> Firstly, was it not decided that xml:lang was to be removed or at least ignored?  </s>
<s> Secondly, this is a matter of value qualification (or statement qualification, depending on your particular bent) At present, it seems the preferred way of handling this is  </s>
<s> by using a blank node that has the literal value and  </s>
<s> the qualifiers hanging off it.  </s>
<s> E.g. X ex:title _:1 .  </s>
<s> _:1 rdf:value "foo" .  </s>
<s> _:1 xml:lang "en" .  </s>
<s> [or in RDF/XML:  </s>
<s> with the datatyping presumption xml:lang rdfs:range xsd:lang .  </s>
<s> or an alternative is reification  </s>
<s> X ex:title "foo" .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:type rdf:Statement .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:subject X .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:predicate ex:title .  </s>
<s> _:s rdf:object "foo" .  </s>
<s> _:s xml:lang "en" .  </s>
<s> So, this really isn't a datatyping issue at all.  </s>
<s> It's a qualification/scoping issue.  </s>
<s> The literal "foo" does not have a datatype of (xml:lang,"en") but rather that is a property of the value (not the literal).  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> Patrick Stickler said:  </s>
<s> Not at present: Summary: "This is a mess - it is in the syntax and not in the model.  </s>
<s> Should have used an RDF vocabulary for language.  </s>
<s> It should be removed from the syntax."  </s>
<s> Currently: for discussion Which is really, waiting for the datatypes/what is a literal?  </s>
<s> discussion to complete.  </s>
<s> That's OK, if you model like that, see below.  </s>
<s> I don't think using xml:lang as a property is widespread.  </s>
<s> Doesn't that require schema support in order to use it?  </s>
<s> xml:lang in M&amp;S doesn't need that  </s>
<s> That attaches it to the statement, not the unicode string, see below  </s>
<s> I don't know about prefered way; the abvoe is one way to model it but  </s>
<s> RDF/XML in M&amp;S gives the other way: M&amp;S says: "The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to associate a language with the property value.  </s>
<s> There is no specific data model representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the literal.  </s>
<s> An application may ignore language tagging of a string.  </s>
<s> All RDF applications must specify whether or not language tagging in literals is significant; that is, whether or not language is considered when performing string matching or other processing."  </s>
<s> so there are several get out clauses there.  </s>
<s> This form is used in examples and M&amp;S and also, the RDF Schema for RDFS: and we owe the community an answer for what these forms mean.  </s>
<s> I think that since we use XML for the syntax, and M&amp;S mentions xml:lang, we must continue to support it.  </s>
<s> The in-scope xml:lang  </s>
<s> attributes affect all inner literal element content so that I want to know about these statements: and how you think they should be modelled?  </s>
<s> Do literal-labelled nodes become (unicode string, optional xml:lang) pair as the quoted paragraph above I think indicates - "part of the literal"?  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> I stand corrected.  </s>
<s> Though I still don't see this as a datatyping issue.  </s>
<s> A literal value with xml:lang qualification is not a "kind of" xml:lang.  </s>
<s> The xml:lang attribute does not assign a type to the literal.  </s>
<s> What else could it be?  </s>
<s> Only if you want the datatyping to be explicit in the RDF graph rather than left to the application layer.  </s>
<s> I.e., I was presuming a datatyping interpretation of xml:lang to be xsd:lang, not requiring the range constraint to be made explicitly.  </s>
<s> Nothing attaches to the unicode string.  </s>
<s> Literals do not act as subjects.  </s>
<s> You must use some form of idiom to infer properties of literals (or rather of the values they denote).  </s>
<s> It is not the literal that is "English" but rather the value denoted by the literal.  </s>
<s> After all, what does "pan" mean.  </s>
<s> Is it English?  </s>
<s> Spanish?  </s>
<s> The literal itself means nothing.  </s>
<s> It's just a sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> You must have context to determine meaning.  </s>
<s> The xml:lang property provides context for the interpretation of natural language strings.  </s>
<s> This problem is disjunct from the problem of interpretation of lexical forms per datatype.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant a preferred way to express value or statement qualification, not for using xml:lang.  </s>
<s> Apologies for being unclear.  </s>
<s> In principle, I agree, though it is a difficult issue.  </s>
<s> We would want support of xml:lang, as with e.g. XML Schema datatypes, to be provided, but by generic mechanisms and not with special interpretation in either the syntax or model.  </s>
<s> I would treat this as two statements where the first is qualified for language but the second is not.  </s>
<s> Whether a given application wishes to consider these statements synonymous in a give context is undefined.  </s>
<s> I hope not.  </s>
