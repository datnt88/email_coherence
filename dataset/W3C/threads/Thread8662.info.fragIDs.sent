<s> Hi Joseph,  </s>
<s> I just have glanced at both the schema definitions and the new schema drafts.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately the schema drafts have undergone lots of changes (apart from the change to simpletype/complextype), e. g. * the '*' value in maxOccurs is now called 'unbounded' * the former group attribute "order" with values like "sequence", "choice"  </s>
<s> has been rejected.  </s>
<s> These semantics now can be exressed by subelements named "sequence", "choice".  </s>
<s> * the former simple type "uri" is now called "uriReference" Somewhere along this reading I have stopped, since I am not very familiar with  </s>
<s> the new drafts, and I think I sometimes have to work through the whole matter more intensively.  </s>
<s> To put it in a nutshell, I think we must (once again) redesign our schema definitions so that they conform with XML Schema again.  </s>
<s> BTW:  </s>
<s> In [1] I found out that you have not found one of my reported typos.  </s>
<s> Actually the parenthesis can be found in section 2.1.1 (and not in 2.2.1, as I stated before):  </s>
<s> The verifier may obtain the digested content in another method so long as the digest verifies.  </s>
<s> In particular, the verifier may obtain the content from a different location such as a local store) than that specified in the URI.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregor,  </s>
<s> That's why I couldn't find it!  </s>
<s> smile Fixed.  </s>
<s> "choice"  </s>
<s> Right you are.  </s>
<s> Odd.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I can explain it in that I've been using Henry Thompson's validator and maybe it's still permitting bits of the older syntax.  </s>
<s> However, he's presently rewriting it for public release, so I'll speak to him about the above.  </s>

<s> Actually, I checked the schema file, and it references the January draft not the last call.  </s>
<s> So since I said I'll review last call I'll go through and make the changes for the post FTF meeting draft.  </s>
