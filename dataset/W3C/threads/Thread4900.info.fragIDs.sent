Hi, I was surprised when I looked in the XQuery specification for a media type definition, but couldn't find one. 
I believe XQuery should have its own. 
FWIW, there's a TAG finding that seems to recommend it too; "W3C Working Groups engaged in defining a language SHOULD arrange for the registration of an Internet Media Type (defined in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) for that language" -- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2002/0129-mime#registration Thanks!

If you look in the XQueryX WD [1] you will see that we plan to do the XQuery media type in that specification.

Ah, thanks Paul. 
I'm not sure why that didn't turn up in Google ... By "the XQuery media type", do you mean a single media type for both the human readable format, and for the XML format? 
Because I'm not sure that's the best idea. 
RFC 2048, the media type registration procedure document, says this; "All registered media types must employ a single, canonical data format, regardless of registration tree." -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt 
section 2.2.4 Also, consider that you couldn't use the "+xml" convention of RFC 3023. 
So IMO, two media types would be best. 
Thanks. 
Mark.
