<s> Hi, I was surprised when I looked in the XQuery specification for a media type definition, but couldn't find one.  </s>
<s> I believe XQuery should have its own.  </s>
<s> FWIW, there's a TAG finding that seems to recommend it too; "W3C Working Groups engaged in defining a language SHOULD arrange for the registration of an Internet Media Type (defined in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) for that language" -- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2002/0129-mime#registration Thanks!  </s>

<s> If you look in the XQueryX WD [1] you will see that we plan to do the XQuery media type in that specification.  </s>

<s> Ah, thanks Paul.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure why that didn't turn up in Google ... By "the XQuery media type", do you mean a single media type for both the human readable format, and for the XML format?  </s>
<s> Because I'm not sure that's the best idea.  </s>
<s> RFC 2048, the media type registration procedure document, says this; "All registered media types must employ a single, canonical data format, regardless of registration tree." -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt  </s>
<s> section 2.2.4 Also, consider that you couldn't use the "+xml" convention of RFC 3023.  </s>
<s> So IMO, two media types would be best.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
