Interactions are bound to WSDL operations, as I understand the current draft. 
This implies a few things and some questions: WS-CDL must be associated to some abstract WSDL service definitions (port types but not ports)? 
Concrete WSDL defined by each participant must built on this abstract WSDL? 
Why specify a message type in the interaction? 
Why not in the associated WSDL? 
Could they be different? 
How do you guaranty that they cannot be different if specified in two different places? 
As I understand it, the only operations that will be referenced are One-Way and Request/Response, no Notifcation and Sollicite-Response will be needed/allowed? 
I understand why you do that, but this is a big departure from WSDL itself? 
A comment with respect to state alignment and work unit. 
It looks like the granularity at which isAligned() can be used is too big and that could defeat the purpose of work units along with state alignment which are otherwise very useful concepts. 
BPSS offers alignment at the message level (it is not because you received a message that this message is understood as valid and can be processed by the receiver). 
If no protocol is available to notify the sender of potential standard errors for each message, then these error notifications must be implemented in the choreography itself. 
This is not a satisfying solution, because you end up acking the ack. 
As I learned it, it is only through the use of widely agreed upon and structurally constant signals that you can really guarantee state alignment otherwise, I am under the impression that it will remain a wish rather than a fact. 
JJ- Hi JJ, Its good to have you back even after all this time. 
It would be nicer though to have you in the group where you could help us with CDL ;- Anyhow, you are raising some very interesting questions and as Steve has said earlier we are going to log issues (if they don't already exist) based on your feedback and all other feedback we get from the public list. 
Nick Nick: Actually, I am not really back, just trying to understand your work informally. 
Hum...is that an invitation? 
Sounds like you have a lot of brain power already. 
I don't know if I am capable of adding anything to your work. 
has based Actually, I was expecting a more substantive response, I guess we did not have an agreed upon choreography in place and it sounds like you took an unforeseen exception path in somewhat basic unit of work. 
I would hate to have this choreography park. 
It would be really great if you have some time and could compensate with an answer to these questions, as I really did not mean to raise any issue. 
At least I cannot see where I raised an issue or did I? JJ- associated will which message errors in you really
