<s> Actually, the reference in the mail archive is here: But it's also the one that's included at the back of the Primer that Eric has been developing (less some of the diagrams).  </s>
<s> I know you read the version you cited, I got your comments, acknowledged them, and tried to address some of them.  </s>
<s> If you'll read the version in the Primer, I don't think you'll find I confuse people with their names (part of why I did that in the version you read was the way the triples syntax has us quoting strings used in triples, but that's another subject).  </s>
<s> As far as using strings for predicates (and then "fixing them"), and related issues, I think I've brought up the fact several times: (a) that I thought there were some benefits to this method of presentation (like, this is the way ordinary people make statements, and it'd be nice to see how those statements get translated to RDF concepts gradually), although I also recognize (and have stated as much) that you have a valid point about wanting to start off with "pure" RDF from the beginning (PS: it would have been "wrong" to state that, for example, using strings for predicates, or the triples I wrote using them, were valid RDF, but I don't think I did that).  </s>
<s> (b) that I thought this was a significant issue of presentation order that needed to be explicitly addressed and decided on.  </s>
<s> Part of my point here is that it hasn't been explicitly addressed or decided on.  </s>
<s> Rather, your material has one order, and my material has a different one.  </s>
<s> I didn't do my presentation differently from yours just to be bloody minded; I felt some people might be confused if we expected them to understand the property/value pair model that RDF uses, *and* the use of URIs for those properties and values (and subjects), *at the same time*.  </s>
<s> So I started off with what I thought would be more familiar to most people, and then introduced the URI idea (NB: URLs for Web pages are familiar to most people; URIs for anything and everything aren't).  </s>
<s> Be that as it may, the order you've used has some advantages (and some disadvantages IMHO); the order I've used has some advantages (IMHO) and some disadvantages.  </s>
<s> Where does that leave us?  </s>
<s> If we're going to work independently on this material with any degree of coherency in the result, we have to decide these sorts of things (and also who is likely to be confused by what).  </s>
<s> That's what I want to have happen, and if it does happen, this exchange will have served its purpose.  </s>
<s> If we decide to go "URIs all the way" (which I could certainly live with; we just need to decide), I'll have to think about what material I might want to add in order to address some problems I think people might have with *that* approach.  </s>
<s> (I suspect the URI section would have to get a bit longer, for example).  </s>
<s> I would still argue that we need more examples of statements than we have now.  </s>
<s> I don't understand your point about "Web Architecture as tools to use, as opposed to a foundation to build on" (???) --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
<s> Primer fans-- I've gone over the current Primer draft again, and think I can see how to both address Aaron's concerns about using correct RDF from the start (instead of triples with string names for the predicates and so on), and mine about introducing the RDF "model" (graphs and triples) in a fairly complete way right away, without doing to much violence to the material we have now, by an appropriate interleaving of that material.  </s>
<s> I don't think I'll have a draft before the telecon, but might have a draft of at least that material for us to consider either by the end of today or sometime tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Anyway, we can talk about it.  </s>
