<s> Back in August we were last discussing the accessibility of the W3C email archives.  </s>
<s> The W3C Team (Dom, the webmaster) has now started on a design proposal for archive reforms.  </s>
<s> Here is the first draft for the archives improvement proposal: This document explains what changes are proposed, why, and links to implementations of these changes.  </s>
<s> The 'implementations' are demo-ware mockups.  </s>
<s> The links peter out after a while.  </s>
<s> Please comment on this description and the example instances.  </s>
<s> Be as specific as you can in describing what features you used, and what if any difficulties you encountered or you expect users with disabilities would encounter.  </s>
<s> Post comments here to wai-xtech@w3.org.  </s>
<s> Thank you Al PS: The previous send was a typo, I was not really ready to send.  </s>
<s> Just a quick note to anyone who might try these pages with versions of JAWS earlier than 4.0, at least I think that's the right version.  </s>
<s> Remember that earlier versions of JAWS defaulted to showing a title tag on a text link as opposed to the link text.  </s>
<s> You need to change JAWS to default to reading screen text.  </s>
<s> You can do this on the fly by pressing insert-v and then changing the Text Links Verbosity option.  </s>
<s> I mention this because if you don't make this change you'll find some text duplication for things like Next and Previous message.  </s>
<s> A few comments: On the page http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-period  </s>
<s> I find the following at the beginning.  </s>
<s> *L indicates where AT says "link". wai-xtech@w3.org  </s>
<s> from August 2001: By Date wai-xtech@w3.org  </s>
<s> from August 2001 By Date *L 58 messages sorted by *[ author ] *[ thread ] *[ subject ] Would it be possible to include "sorted" in the line that indicates the current sort method?  </s>
<s> Also consider changing the "sorted by" to "sort by"  </s>
<s> The page http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-inde seems to have a search feature at the beginning.  </s>
<s> But I find no Go/Search button to submit my search.  </s>

<s> It would also be nice (in my opinion) to include the number of messages with the setction of the mailing list: March 2202 - 1 mesage | sorted by date | by author | by thread  </s>
<s> (I don't think there are many screen reader users left who need the vertical bar seperator.  </s>
<s> But as a visual user I find that it helps me a lot.)  </s>

<s> No, I think there isn't one there in the mockup.  </s>
<s> Actually I would find it  </s>
<s> helpful if the search stuff were moved to the end of the page, so I didn't have to jump through it at the start - but then I tend to rely on memory of what happened when (more or less) more than I do on searching.  </s>

<s> Err, could you clarify?  </s>
<s> Where would like to see that: in the index page, in the period page or in the message page?  </s>
<s> The index page already has the number of messages in the table, so does the period page.  </s>
<s> Right, this needs to be fixed.  </s>

<s> In the index page.  </s>
<s> What I mean is to have the number of messages included in the first link, rather than listed at the end of the table.  </s>
<s> (Or as text after the first link but before the second one).  </s>
<s> a href="x" mar 1815 - 1 message /a | a href="x.a"  </s>
<s> sorted by author /a | ... Or something similar.  </s>
<s> I would also like to explicitly ask for those little visual bars as seperators.  </s>

<s> :  </s>
<s> I've fixed this, inserted the new search form proposed by Olivier and fixed the titles on the sort methods on the period page (Kelly's comment).  </s>
<s> Al, I didn't get much feedback on this proposal: what should be the next step?  </s>
<s> Should we go ahead as is?  </s>
<s> I think you wanted to send some detailed feedback too.  </s>
<s> For the record, the project is at: Regards, Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C's Webmaster  </s>
<s> Yes, I believe there is more that should be said.  </s>
<s> May I have two more days (before Thursday) to get it to you (and to this list)?  </s>
