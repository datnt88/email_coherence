This doesn't use Annotea, but instead extends the approach to annotating images used by RDFPic. 
An offering from Norm Walsh that provides tools for adding information to jpeg images.

That would be I take it? 
According to the blurb here (if I understand correctly), it doesn't allow you to modify the info actually within the jpeg, but allows you to extract and manipulate it. 
It uses RDF (via the Jena Java toolkit) so I imagine it's fairly Annotea-friendly. 
Cheers, Danny. 
Ah yes, sorry for forgetting to put the URI, and thanks Danny for being on the ball :) You can query things in a jpeg (for example EXIF or I think XMP), and you can update them, according to the documentation that Norm provides: you can change what is in the jpeg already. 
One of the things that interests me is linking between annotea servers and how to federate diferent sources of information (for example merging info included in a jpeg and info about it stored in an annotea server). 
cheers (and thanks again for being on the ball :) Charles
