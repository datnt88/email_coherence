<s> This document: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/ Contains these bits: ...which are less than usefully explicit for "priority 1" items, and unfortunate implementation precedent proves that elaboration is needed.  </s>
<s> Currently, the only techniques cited to assure user control of font size are  </s>
<s> "...[A]llow the user to control font size through style sheets or the user interface.  </s>
<s> Or allow the user to magnify text." and "Implement the CSS 'font-size' property."  </s>
<s> I can think of at least one implementation [WinIE5] which arguably passes muster under such lax language, which nevertheless presents serious usability problems in this area.  </s>
<s> The result is that many authors are less ready to embrace accessibility-conscious visual design techniques.  </s>
<s> The problem lies in the details of the CSS font-size property implementation, for which no explicit normative references exist.  </s>
<s> The CSS Recommendations, for their part, have tended to avoid UI specifics that might offend some members' sense of "turf", as it can affect competitive issues such as look-and-feel, OS integration, etc., or so it seems to me.  </s>
<s> This W3C product, however, seems like the right vehicle.  </s>
<s> For the sake of "getting to the point", I'll suggest additions/revisions first, with discussion of rationale to follow: * Implement the CSS 'font-size' property as follows: * When a single font-size value is solicited in UI, the font- size choice must define the value of the 'medium' font-size keyword.  </s>
<s> Larger and smaller absolute size keyword values must be computed relative to the user-chosen 'medium' value.  </s>
<s> * To avoid confusion, circularity, and indeterminacy, user-chosen font-size values should not themselves be given in keyword terms (e.g. 'medium', 'smaller', etc.), but in length units appropriate to the media type (e.g., 16px for the screen media type, 12pt for print, etc.).  </s>
<s> * UAs should take available resolution into account when calculating the CSS absolute font-size keyword intervals, such that, e.g., the three size values below 'medium' remain legible and distinct from one another as long as the user-chosen 'medium' value is itself at least three steps above the legibility floor, as determined by device and font design constraints.[1]  </s>
<s> * the font-size choice exposed to the user in UI must provide a font-size value for the root elements of documents to be rendered.  </s>
<s> * Implement the CSS2 Processing Model  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/intro.html#processing-model)  </s>
<s> such that a font-size specified on the document root (e.g., HTML) will inherit predictably per the CSS cascading and inheritance rules (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/cascade.html) to all children, including HTML TABLE elements.  </s>
<s> The reason for most of these elaborations should be clear upon considering their *lack* in practice.  </s>
<s> If an author wishes to respect the font size needs of the user, s/he must be able to assume certain sympathetic correlations between hir stylesheet rules and those of the user, as well as predictable cascading and inheritance rules.  </s>
<s> This is common sense, yet implementations are in chaos for lack of norms here, and a lot depends on cleaning things up.  </s>
<s> Need I say more than that "medium" used by an author as a font-size value maps to a size ONE STEP LARGER than the "medium" selected by users as a default font size in WinIE5?  </s>
<s> Of course, this throws off the meaning of SMALL and all the rest rather absurdly.  </s>
<s> This renders the keyword system unusable in commercial Web design practice.  </s>
<s> And the weirdly tenacious table-related inheritance bugs in WinIE and Netscape 4.x render the other font-size schemes equally useless.  </s>
<s> You don't want to see more slow, inaccessible GIF/pixel text?  </s>
<s> Then help fix the CSS alternatives by explicitly stating the font-size UI requirements in CSS terms!  </s>
<s> Rationale The WAI Authoring guidelines wisely discourage the use of absolute length units (e.g., "points") for font-size values in the screen media type, instead favoring relative units (e.g., ems) for their supposed reference to a UA default font size, presumably under control of the user.  </s>
<s> The trouble with relative length units, however, is that they are *not* relative to the font size set by the user.  </s>
<s> They are instead relative to the font size of the parent element in the document tree, which itself may or may not refer to a user-set font size.  </s>
<s> Accessibility-conscious use of relative length units thus requires a more confident knowledge of how user style rules (e.g., preference settings) are resolved against author style rules and the document tree than is warranted either by normative references or deployed UAs.  </s>
<s> It is nowhere specified, for instance, that the font size exposed in the UI is understood to be to 1em on any document node, and in fact UAs vary significantly both in how they parse documents into trees and in how style rules inherit through said trees.  </s>
<s> Most Netscape and Microsoft products, for instance, fail even to consider the root element of HTML documents (i.e., HTML) to be part of the parse tree, susceptible to formatting rules.  </s>
<s> More significantly, they fail to inherit many style properties - including font-size - into TABLE elements, instead setting these back to the user-set size by default.  </s>
<s> Other, less idiosyncratic UAs such as MacIE4.5 and Opera *DO* inherit font-size into TABLE elements, presenting accessibility conscious authors with an awful dilemma: either specify font size in relative length units redundantly for TABLE elements as the most popular UAs require, thus screwing things up badly for Opera and MacIE4.5, or abandon CSS and stick with good-old BIG/SMALL or deprecated FONT tags in every last cell.  </s>
<s> The reason that FONT tags and the like succeed where CSS relative length units do not is that FONT tags, per HTML 3.2, take scalar values 1-7, and relative values along this scale.  </s>
<s> These scalar values are anchored (at size "3") to the font size chosen by the user, and are *exempt from document tree inheritance issues* ("absolute"), making them far-and-away the most useful and accessible scheme currently implemented.  </s>
<s> Commercial sites that must work use them, and will continue to do so ad infinitum unless CSS implementations (and their UIs) are brought to a similar standard of usefulness.  </s>
<s> CSS superceded the FONT size system with 7 keyword sizes of its own, but the scheme is underspecified and has been badly botched in implementation.  </s>
<s> There are no really good alternatives - you can't get  </s>
<s> by with ems/percentages, especially not before the sacred table bugs are crushed.  </s>
<s> This must be fixed.  </s>
<s> Hence my proposed amendments to the WAI UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> ps: I am no expert in aural stylesheet concepts, but it seems to me that what goes for font size might just as readily go for, say, "volume".  </s>
<s> The user must be able to define the value of "normal" in absolute terms in order for authors to make meaningful use of, e.g., "loud" and "quiet"....  </s>

<s> are  </s>
<s> It seems to me that because low-vision users have a particularly strong interest in this aspect of style usability, this clarification is appropriate for the UAGL and UAT.  </s>
<s> For the purposes of making the situation clear to the CSS community, I would [without a lot of reflection] tend to prefer that I be able to refer into the UAT for this discussion, as opposed to some freestanding Note for which there is no obvious charter or accessibility tie-in.  </s>
<s> The UAT document is not hidden as compared with a freestanding note.  </s>
<s> Publishing this here gives the CSS folks the context and rationale for the correction.  </s>
<s> The CSS specification does not presently meet accessibility needs because it is vague to a debilitating degree as regards the kind of user abstraction that Todd is explaining.  </s>
<s> However, this is style-control  </s>
<s> behavior that the user with partial functional impairment in vision requires, and hence it is properly in scope for the UA group to articulate in their own planned work products, so far as I can tell.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, we should consider adding a checkpoint abstracted from Todd's techniques to the effect that there should be one control in the UI which accomplishes a general increase or decrease of the font sizes throughout the document, while preserving size ordering of different text fragments to the maximum extent with user directives.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/intro.html#processing-model)  </s>
<s> Excellently phrased.  </s>
<s> If WAI authoring guidelines (and the techniques I've suggested) are observed, users should be able to accomplish this simply by re-specifying their preferred font size - no special checkpoint/technique required.  </s>
<s> When authors use pixel- or absolute-length units (e.g., points) for text, however, it is charitable (and sometimes correct) to assume that the text must maintain a consistent size relationship to non-textual elements.  </s>
<s> In this case, I think a "zoom/magnify"  </s>
<s> functionality (such as implemented in the Opera UA) should be  </s>
<s> required to override specified measures.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you'd have to treat pixels or points specified for text as less privileged than pixels or points specified for (or inherent to) other objects, and that strikes me as unclean.  </s>
<s> Todd Fahrner  </s>
<s> That is correct.  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> I have been an invited expert to the CSS&amp;FP WG since 1996, and have been harping on such "implementation issues" for 18 months or so, in W3C and other fora.  </s>
<s> I do not believe that any such Note is forthcoming.  </s>
<s> If you believe, as I do, that resolution of these matters is critical to the coherence of the WAI's recommendations regarding font size, I suggest that the WAI must not defer the responsibility.  </s>
<s> * Implement the CSS2 Processing Model [snip]  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> But the "non-normative" language couching the CSS-2 processing model description belies the fact that other models or ad hoc contortions are highly unlikely to support the cascade in as reliably determinate a fashion, and is illustrative of the CSS&amp;FP WG's reticence or inability to address many UA implementation issues head-on.  </s>
<s> This isn't censure, either; I recognize that it is sometimes necessary to choose one's battles carefully, and to run away from the rest.  </s>
<s> In view of the apparently determined disregard for the cascade in mainstream UAs (failure to inherit from HTML or even BODY into TH/TD), and the importance of same for WAI guidelines to be viable in practice, I suggest that the WAI establish an explicit checkpoint for correct behavior.  </s>
<s> I believe that Microsoft will effectively defeat any such pushing in the CSS&amp;FP WG, since it is contrary to their increasingly stable (stagnant?) implementation of HTML, CSS, and attendant UI, at least in Win32/Office2K.  </s>
<s> I think it is incumbent upon this group either to challenge this state of affairs, or to accept that MS's implementation is the de facto standard in this regard, and reformulate its recommendations regarding font size control accordingly.  </s>
<s> I advocate the former, as I can't see a way through the latter.  </s>
<s> I do.  </s>
<s> If I fail to convince you, however, would you regard it as proper for the WAI to flag these implementation issues formally for the CSS&amp;FP WG, as WAI concerns?  </s>
<s> Todd Fahrner  </s>
<s> As Al Gilman has indicated, the WAI PF WG is probably the appropriate WG to apply such pressure.  </s>
<s> PF has already been made aware of the issue.  </s>
<s> Thank you again Todd for the precise analysis.  </s>
