<s> Yes, it's on, but you phoned in early.  </s>
<s> It's 3PM EST which is 15:00 in 24 hour time, which something like 21:00 (+-1 hour) in western Europe ( I don't know the exact conversion with daylight savings time, etc.) I hope you will still be able to be with us then, since the Altifier is a major topic.  </s>

<s> People may want to talk about this today, or defer it, but I have a potential application scenario that I have been thinking about and would like others to think about.  </s>
<s> You could call it "distance user testing."  </s>
<s> Toronto has a setup like this now.  </s>
<s> I think we want to think about how our modules could flow into such an environment for industrial-strength evaluation of techniques.  </s>
<s> This is a situation where people with various ability profiles participate in systematic, structured-sample user testing and _they are the only person at their location involved_.  </s>
<s> What does one want in such a workstation?  </s>
<s> Session logging?  </s>
<s> Remote administration?  </s>
<s> Shrink-wrapped Aps and rapid-prototype modifications?  </s>
<s> Anyhow, that's one of my answers for "where do we see this stuff going _next_ if someone codes something and someone else likes it?"  </s>
