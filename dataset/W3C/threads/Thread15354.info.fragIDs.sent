<s> Hello, On the mailing list, we have had some discussion about numbering success criteria [1].  </s>
<s> Jason, Gregg, Ben, and I were editing the next draft and came up with the following proposal.  </s>
<s> If each guideline was identified by a letter (e.g., "N" for "Navigable") rather than a number (3) and if each conformance letter was identified by a letter (M for Minimum, S for Second Level, T for Third Level), then each success criterion could have a unique identifier (e.g., N3M1, N3M2, N3S1).  </s>
<s> For example, the current checkpoint 3.4 with the proposed scheme:  </s>
<s> Checkpoint N4 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint N4 at the Minimum Level if: N4M1.  </s>
<s> where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them.  </s>
<s> N4M2.  </s>
<s> wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the following is true: a. an easy to find setting, that persists for the site visit, is provided for the user to deactivate processes or features that cause extreme changes in context or b. extreme changes in context are identified before they occur so the user can determine if they wish to proceed or so they can be prepared for the change At the Second Level:  </s>
<s> N4S1. the content has been reviewed, and it has been found that where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to its  </s>
<s> function (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.), the user is warned in advance of encountering them At the Third Level: (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> Pros and Cons: - Should sound better for screen reader users since there are not multiple numbers that are read in a row and the numbers follow  </s>
<s> the letters.  </s>
<s> - Creates a unique identifier for each success criterion.  </s>
<s> - Might be harder to decipher the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> - Is not consistent with WCAG 1.0, ATAG 1.0, or UAAG 1.0 numbering schemes.  </s>
<s> - However, since it is different and since some people need to conform to both WCAG and ATAG or WCAG and UAAG, they are less likely to confuse ATAG/UAAG checkpoint 3.4 with WCAG 2.0 checkpoint N4. - Not sure that it help distinguish our conformance levels from those of WCAG 1.0 (Level A, Level AA, Level AAA) and the priority scheme (priority 1, 2, 3).  </s>
<s> Although, we did make a minor change: previous "Level 2" is "Second Level" and "Level 3" is "Third Level." Discussion questions: 1.  </s>
<s> Is this easier or harder to decipher than the previous proposals?  </s>
<s> i.e., 1.1.1.1 or 1.1-1a ?  </s>
<s> 2. Is it a benefit that this is different from the WCAG/ATAG/UAAG 1.0 numbering scheme or will it cause confusion?  </s>
<s> 3. Our preliminary tests showed this was better for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> Do you agree or disagree? 4. Other issues or comments about this proposal?  </s>
<s> We discussed some other possibilities but discarded those because: 1. we wanted to associate the checkpoint with the guideline in some way to preserve the grouping (thus we didn't want to assign a unique number to each checkpoint).  </s>
<s> 2. we wanted to make something that would not be garbled by a screen reader (1.1.-1a was read as "one one one ah" instead of "one one one A").  </s>

<s> Whether or not this is a good idea for English-speakers, I think this would be a nightmare for internationalization.  </s>
<s> For one thing, it's very unlikely that in all languages, the five best translations of Perceivable, Operable, etc., would all start with different letters.  </s>
<s> The same goes for Minimum, Second and Third.  </s>
<s> The semantics would lose all meaning when localized.  </s>
<s> I don't know that success criteria numbering is a problem that exists outside of the WCAG WG; therefore, I propose that any solution to this problem should be handled within the WG, without passing it on to the end users of the document.  </s>
<s> If we want to use this terminology to streamline discussion on conference calls or in email, then we can just as easily adopt it as shorthand without changing the document itself.  </s>
<s> (Or perhaps something more intuitive to participants, like G3.2-AAA-1.)  </s>
<s> As AUWG contact, this represents a problem for me, since our document's conformance scheme depends on that of WCAG, and I'm concerned this would confuse tool vendors.  </s>

<s> Wendy, whilst M,S and T are consistent in there usage, and repeated regularly throughout the Guidelines, really there seams little reason for reducing Navigable to N. This has been discussed at length with regard to some HTML attribute, I forget which.  </s>
<s> The point is that for very little extra text the meaning is more immediately transparent.  </s>
<s> back on M,S and T, don't we already have A, AA and AAA as well as 1,2 and 3 do we need another tier?  </s>

<s> Gregg, as if I need to spell it out, I agree with Matt, and would prefer, one English word such as Navigation to be included as a topic marker Presumably this word could be translated for localisation AAA is clearer than 1,2 ,3 in my opinion as AAA is clearly the best, whereas 1 and 3 are arguable.....similarly with A and C thanks Jonathan  </s>
<s> We decided to not use A, AA, AAA in WCAG 2.0 because 2.0 is structured in a completely different way and level 1 2 and 3 don't mean the same thing as A, AA, and AAA.  </s>
<s> So it would be confusing.  </s>
<s> But if we ignore that detail - and just think of it as being 3 levels of increasing accessibility.  </s>
<s> Interesting to consider.  </s>

<s> I just meant the time it took to read different numbering approaches.  </s>

<s> N3M2 becomes "N" "3" "M" "2" which is quite fast and informative.  </s>
<s> I can tell this is the 3rd Checkpoint under Navigation - 2nd success criteria under minimum.  </s>

<s> ("dot" may be "point" on some screen readers but result is same.)  </s>
<s> You can read the other proposals aloud too and see what they sound like, and how long they are.  </s>
<s> Remember that these numbers are read before each item in a list and break up ones ability to view the items as groups.  </s>
<s> Some ideas we have seen are - be sure each item has full and unique number or label - make sure that the numbers are informative - just put the lowest level numbering and use the titles above for context - have full numbers but have a script that will shorten the numbering for screen reader users - use numbering that allows you to quickly place the success criteria even when out of context - make numbering easy and quick (short) to say for screen reader users who must listen to it before each item.  </s>
