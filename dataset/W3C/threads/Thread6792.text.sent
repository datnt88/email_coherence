It would be good if the link checker offered multidocument publication support e.g. today (1st december) i wish to link check (OWL Test Cases hopeful PR) which is dated 9th december and has links to other 9th dec. 
docs. 
If the link checker had an additional box where you could put up a set of pairs of URLs INTENDED = CURRENT then it could check a "future" URL by mapping it to the current editors draft URL. 
(In fact this could be used to check all the documents in a multidocument set at the same time); also could flag any use of one of the CURRENT urls (which is usually a mistake, not always).

: The linkchecker has this function, but only available as a command line parameter; cf http://www.aero.jussieu.fr/WEB-outils/docs/checklink.html (I agree that having this as an advanced capabitility of the on-line version would be good; but this is better proposed/discussed on www-validator) Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM If the link checker had an additional box where you could put up a set of pairs of URLs INTENDED = CURRENT It's not there in the web interface but it is (or was, at least) there in the command line version if you run the perl locally.

For more information on a proactive anti-virus service working around the clock, around the globe, visit: Perhaps this is on-topic for this list then ... the needs of multidocument spec-prod would be better met by having support for a specific link checker for each multidocument set. 
e.g. for OWL there would be a particular page with the mappings set (by perhaps the team contact) Each editor could then use that page to check their document. 
I suppose this could be provided by the link checker page accepting a query part of the URI that sets up the mappings. 
(Then the multidocument set specific checker would just be the standard link checker with a specific query part).
