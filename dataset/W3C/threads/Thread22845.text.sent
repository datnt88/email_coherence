Hello, can anyone tell me the right way to process multivalued attributes? 
I have a DTD which specifies an attribute as type NMTOKENS. 
In the dom-tree I get only a single string containing the NMTOKENS separated by spaces. 
Do I have to parse this string by myself if I want to access the single NMTOKENS? 
Thank you for your attention, Stefan Wachter SWachter@heyde.de have get have Yes, you have to parse the string yourself. 
Future versions of the DOM may or may not provide additional assistance. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Yes. 
But then you also had to discover its type was NMTOKENS by yourself too, so at least it's consistent in that ... :-) - Dave
