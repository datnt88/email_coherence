I am still not sure what you are talking about. 
*Could you give more context?* 
Why? 
What? 
How? etc. - - - Is it stats of usage for the browsers? 
Things like http://www.upsdell.com/BrowserNews/stat.htm 
Which are never quite exact, for example, Opera Browser to be able to access some Web sites which do browser detection fake its id and is counted as IE. 
You have also plenty of browsers that are not counted but still are an important part of people using the Web. 
Voice Browsers Braille Readers Mobile Phones (a lot in Europe and Asia, North America is years late on this topic) Text Browsers Authoring Tools which can be browsers too Bots etc.

Hi Kichelle, How do you mean by 'requirements'? 
Do you mean if what is the current browser that corporations and educational organisations are using? 
Or do you mean what is the latest browser version available, or ... do you mean which browsers are recommended? 
Or ... none of the above? 
:) cheers, -steph 
People (and others) are currently using virtually _all_ released versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape browsers as well as many other browsers. 
Are you interested in the currently most popular browsers and their versions? 
The answer will depend on your web site audience. 
You can start your research here: If you are interested in making your pages "look good" in currently popular browsers, you can start with HTH, Alex.
