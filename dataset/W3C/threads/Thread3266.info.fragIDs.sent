<s> Hi Kichelle, How do you mean by 'requirements'?  </s>
<s> Do you mean if what is the current browser that corporations and educational organisations are using?  </s>
<s> Or do you mean what is the latest browser version available, or ... do you mean which browsers are recommended?  </s>
<s> Or ... none of the above?  </s>
<s> :) cheers, -steph  </s>
<s> People (and others) are currently using virtually _all_ released versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape browsers as well as many other browsers.  </s>
<s> Are you interested in the currently most popular browsers and their versions?  </s>
<s> The answer will depend on your web site audience.  </s>
<s> You can start your research here: If you are interested in making your pages "look good" in currently popular browsers, you can start with HTH, Alex.  </s>
