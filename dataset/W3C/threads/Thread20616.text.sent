Hello, I had a look at amaya 4.2.1, looks very nice, but here are some points: 1) No support for frames. 
This doesn't bode well these days. 
Yes I can't stand them either, but do need to look at them. 
2) The loading if images can't be turned off. 
Very bad. 
I am not willing to pay for all the graphics crap many sites put on their stuff. 
3) It's impossible to access links derived from coordinates over an image. 
This is also common these days; amaya fails dismally. 
These links don't show up in the link view either. 
See www.canterbury.ac.nz for an example. 
4) Why do numerous libraries (jpeg, z, ...) have to be statically linked? 
GNU autoconf is a marvellous tool! 
(At 110M compiling it broke - disk full. 
Had to shift somewhere else. 
All that for a 2M binary - this has to be the highest ratio I've seen yet...) 5) When entering a URL, I still have to type the "http://". 
This is majorly dumb as well as antiquated. 
I don't like software forcing me to waste my time. 
I don't care whether it's in any www standard or not. 
Political correctness only makes annoying software. 
6) The editing in both the browser view and the html view is absolutely outstanding!!!!!! 7) If you made the little Help- About Amaya dialog window selectable, I could paste your email address. 
Volker This is on our TODO list. 
I guess the introduction of SVG generated the problem. 
We'll check. 
It's for platforms that have no pre-installed libraries or in the case where available libraries are incompatible. 
You can configure and build with your own libraries. 
To avoid to enter file:// when you are loading a local file it needs to check the local file system first then access the network. 
We didn't spend time on this feature but if any external contributor can contribute there. 
Any volunteer? 
This is a limitation of the used widget. 
Probably the best would be to send a message when clicking on the mail address. 
Who knows how to do that? 
Irene. 
With Perl you can chose what gets linked dynamically when built. 
Perl does not use autoconf to create configure. 
I think it uses metaconf. 
Ruby uses autoconf, and it gives you the choice of static and dynamic linking also. 
FYI but OT admittedly: for those who want to know about Ruby.

This is on our TODO list. 
This would make a big difference to how useful Amaya is to me - There are a number of times when I have decided not to use it directly, but use Lynx to get a text-only copy of a document, becuase I don't have the time to wait for downloads (over a cellphone they are VERY expensive). 
I guess the introduction of SVG generated the problem. 
We'll check. 
In fact the areaas are still available, as you can see if you select View - Map Areas from the menus. 
But there is a bug so that the geometry doesn't put them in the right place. 
This means they are pretty hard to use... To avoid to enter file:// when you are loading a local file it needs to check the local file system first then access the network.

This is eventually just a user preferences question. 
It would of course be handy if you could choose where it looked by default - I find it very handy that it works in my filesystem, but that is becuase I use it a lot to edit in my file system. 
I think a smarter thing to do would be to run jigsaw, and get it to look in http://localhost/ by default, but that still means I need to be able to set preferences. 
And I don't have much time to volunteer right now (sigh) Charles McCN Thanks to all those who cc'd me a copy - if this goes to a mailing list I'm not on it. 
Also, as I pointed out, the high profile sites that have been around a long time have almost unanimously eliminated I have no opinion on this them. 
It's all the e-business sites. 
which just copy each You are not in touch with reality :-) There are few sites not using frames. 
I don't frequent e-business sites. 
Ok, let's settle on 50-50? 
That makes amaya useless for half of the web. 
Not good. 
(PS I don't care about politics. 
If *nix wants to cut it on the desktop, ...) Is there any browser besides amaya which doesn't deal in frames? 
Frames cause lots of problems for the web model, e.g. standard I never denied they're a PITA. 
However, they are reality. 
Checking the local file system is considerably faster than checking the web. 
Also, with all this security stuff coming up, it's much safer too. 
Chances that there is a file called ./www.myfancysite.bull/somedir/somefile 
on my disk are practically zero. 
I dislike software accessing the net by default. 
Personally I'd say that's a waste of time. 
Chances of conlficts here are so small that I'd be quite prepared to type the http:// in those cases, but this is a minor issue. 
Volker Volker Kuhlmann v.kuhlmann@elec.canterbury.ac.nz [DJW:] Firstly, Amaya is an editor for creating valid CSS formatted HTML, not primarily a browser. 
Secondly Lynx (and, I suspect, a couple of other text only browsers) don't support frames. 
html2ps (a printer medium browser, used to create the PDF version of the HTML specification) doesn't. 
WebTV converts frames into tables (I suspect in the gateway - i.e. the actual browser doesn't support them).

[DJW:] Half may well be true, but for it to fail on frames sites, the sites have also got to violate basic accessibility rules and not provide a sensible fallback mechanism (please "upgrade" is not a sensisble fallback). 
As well as the original mechanism, noframes , you can use sensible frame names (not left and right) and use titles on the frames. 
The problem is that few frames sites do things properly - however Amaya's job is to help people do things properly, not really to let them cope with bad design. 
If you want a stable browser capable of handling most current HTML abuses, you should use IE5. 
If you want open source, and can tolerate some instability, you should use the Mozilla series. 
You may get slightly more commercial web support with Netscape's build of these, but people report that it is better to track the latest open source version.
