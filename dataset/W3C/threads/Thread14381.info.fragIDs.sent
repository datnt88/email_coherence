web designers will _not_ accept styled text as a solution because of the following: (1) CSS is not widely implemented yet and excludes older browsers. 
Excuse me butting in, but this assertion should not be allowed to stand unchallenged. 
I suspect that you presented this as a parody rather than as something that you believe yourself, but, since it is such a widespread response, then I respectfully suggest it needs to be more overtly challenged. 
The whole point of the stylesheet concept is that it does NOT "exclude older browsers". 
On the contrary, its proper use ensures access to the content by older browsers (minus some details of the presentation, of course). 
No, it's accurate, and you are not thinking like a graphic artist. 
I am troubled by the continued insistence that graphical web designers' needs are "not really needs" and the callous way in which we dismiss their concerns. 
Is it _any_ surprise that we get back the same attitude when we talk about accessibility? 
Frankly, the WAI folks are _more_ arrogant in dismissing graphical designer needs than graphic artists ever are in dismissing the needs of people with disabilities! 
Let's look at why older browsers are excluded by CSS. 
I'll use my web page as an example. 
(http://kynn.com/ 
for those who haven't read my .sig.) Right now it's orange and yellow and all sorta autumny. 
I use 
tables and I apply styles, colors, and fonts using only CSS. 
If you use Internet Explorer 4+, Opera 3.6+, or Netscape Navigator 4+, you will see a happy autumnal web site, and you will have access to the content of the site. 
If you use an older browser, or one which does not support CSS (or have CSS turned off), you will see a very plain, default- colors web site, and you will have access to the content of the site. 
From an accessibility standpoint, this is GREAT and it is how things are meant to function. 
From a graphic designer standpoint this is a TERRIBLE TRAGEDY and demonstrates exactly why CSS is not reliable -- because it doesn't work in old browsers! 
My design, my feel to the site, the look I was trying for -- it's completely GONE in Netscape 3! Now, if instead of using CSS, I had used attributes on the body tag and the table elements, and maybe some well-chosen solid-color graphics, I _would_ have the same presentation on each browser. 
I could look at it in Netscape 3, Netscape 4, Opera 4, and IE 5.5, and it would WORK on all of them! 
CSS is provably BROKEN for the needs of the graphic artist. 
Remember -- this is an artist who CARES ABOUT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY. 
For YEARS we have been trying to impress people with the need to support older browsers -- and now that our hypothetical designer is doing that (supporting Netscape 3, where a pure CSS model would not work), he's told it can't be used? 
Buh? 
And this isn't even starting to get into the Netscape 4 implementation. 
Look at http://www.hwg.org/ in Netscape 4 and in IE 5. There are three-D buttons visible in IE, but they are GONE and the font styling is WRONG in Netscape. 
But some designers express "needs" which are perverse in WWW terms - and that cannot be achieved anyway. 
But in attempting to achieve the unachievable, they can produce some disastrous consequences. 
It's perfectly achievable. 
Graphic artists have figured out how to get the effects they want. 
You want to replace these workable solutions with broken solutions which are not backwards compatible, because you do not see the problem which is being solved. 
The problem facing web designers is not "making the textual information accessible", it's "making the page look like what I want it to look like." 
It is truly a shame that there are so few graphic artists involved in these discussions, and it is no surprise that we continue to make specifications which will not be applied, because we discount the valid concerns of the people who will have to apply these standards.

Why isn't multi-media the solution instead of the problem? 
Why do people insist that WCAG regards multimedia as "the problem"? 
Without once again going through the laborious exercise of citing all the cites I can assure you that so far as I can determine there is absolutely no intention or even indication of a bias against multimedia presentations regarding any supposedly adverse effects on accessibility. 
The "accusatory" tone of Anne's quote above seems to hound us endlessly. 
WE ARE NOT AGAINST MULTIMEDIA. 
MULTIMEDIA IS NOT THE ENEMY OF ACCESSIBILITY. 
Excuse me for shouting, but I'm tired of being bum-rapped on this issue. 
Bad enough when it's journalists' sound bites but when people close to the undertaking have (and spread) that misconception, it's frustrating.

Kynn, Nice web site. 
Didn't see it in it's previous colors. 
Interesting 
use of style sheets to change the seasons on one's web site! 
Reminds me, I need to update my Halloween page and hang it on our site soon! 
Well said, Kynn. 
In an earlier note to Alan I mentioned Flash which provides a presentation in which text and graphics are displayed while a sound file duplicates the text ... What else is needed for this to be "accessible" to disabled web users? 
Why isn't multi-media the solution instead of the problem?

Seriously, what would be the issues if a multi-media vehicle, such as Flash, would not require a "text equivalent"

kynn recently wrote, quote The problem facing web designers is not "making the textual information accessible", it's "making the page look like what I want it to look like." unquote if this is the aim of the graphic designer, then why aren't graphic designers besieging the campuses of the major UA manufacturers, INSISTING on full support for CSS2, SVG, XSLT, SMIL, and the like? 
(at least to the base level of conformance outlined for each individual spec which includes a conformance section) i find it hard to pity the plight of the graphically oriented designer, especially when, what we (as a group) are constantly being told that what they most want -- namely, that what they see when they design a page is what the end user will receive, have rendered, and perceive when they visit that page -- is ONLY feasible through adherence to standards, and even then, it will still always remain subject to variations in hardware, nationalized versions of products, the situation under which the content is retrieved, etc. so, i fail to see the point of castigating the WAI for being insensitive (or downright hostile) to the graphical components of web design... first of all, it's page authoring, not graphical design that is under discussion -- there is nothing inherently visual slash graphical about the web; that today's web is overwhelmingly visually oriented is the product of 2 inter-related phenomena: (1) a deeply ingrained predisposition for the visual -- "seeing is believing" is the principle tenet of the visually oriented (dare i say, materialist, in the strictest sense of the word?) culture of which today's visually-oriented web is but a reflection; and (2) it should come as no surprise that the use of visually oriented tools that, at heart, rely mainly upon the designer's hand-eye co-ordination and aesthetic sixth sense to create pages, leads to the construction of pages that only truly work as intended if they can be visually perceived -- unless, of course, the author is willing to evaluate and repair the output of the tool used to create the page, which usually entails editing document source by hand... no, i'm not insisting that every page author be fluent (or even conversant) in the markup languages that the tool they are using to create content for the web employs -- that would be as ridiculous as limiting driver's licences to someone who can completely disassemble and reassemble an automobile... and yet, without the requisite tools -- such as an ATAG compliant authoring tool that automatically (where possible) and interactively (where there is no a priori solution) creates pages that contain (a) valid markup; (b) well-labeled and appropriate structural elements; (c) content with which the user can interact in the modality that best fits that individual user's circumstances -- what's an individual page author to do? the answer is quite simple: raise a ruckus... complain to the authoring tool manufactures whenever their tool spits out invalid, inaccessible, and browser-dependent markup; complain to the user agent developers about their lack of support for standards (in whose drafting, i might add, they played a significant role), but don't come to the WAI complaining that its members just don't understand the needs of the visually dependent... in the end, kynn, what is more important? 
that the visitor to your site receive the content you wish to share, or that your page is rendered with absolute fidelity on every machine that hits your page? 
if your concern as a page author is the former, then i suggest you gather an army of webmonsters and lay siege to the UA and AU manufacturers -- or, at least, lash yourselves to their corporate flagpoles; otherwise, if you insist on quote thinking like a graphical artist unquote, my advice would be to stick to a strictly graphical medium, such as print, which can be used to deliver "final form" documents, in which the content is irreducibly wrapped an immutable style in order to be delivered to _passive_ recipients...... like it or not, the web is NOT, nor was it ever intended to be, a graphical medium -- that it is a medium that is capable of delivering graphics is part of what makes it a very powerful tool, but the essence of the web is communication, not decoration... if i am accessing your content, why should you care whether i appreciate your autumnal color scheme or 
not? what about someone accessing your page with a wireless, monitorless 
device? yes, styling is part of the package, and has a place in design, but it should not be the make-or-break point for page authors... and if it is, don't complain to the WAI -- complain to those whose support for CSS is either broken or absent... and get used to the fact that an increasing number of people don't care one whit what stylistic devices are employed on a web site -- they want content, not color schemes and stylistic effects... yes, attention to stylistic detail and the development of a consistent quote look and feel unquote are undeniably important aspects of web design, but they should neither interfere with, nor be an essential component of comprehending, the content being delivered... and who is to say that the color scheme you applied is actually autumnal? 
isn't the underlying meaning of the color scheme a product of the brain of the beholder? 
what meaning would the colors that, in north america, are considered autumnal, have to a resident of the gobi or kalahari deserts -- that is, if they even paused to reflect upon it as anything other than a possible annoyance? 
would it have any meaning at all, or would it be akin to wearing white clothing to a wedding in southeast asia (where, in many cultures, white is the color of mourning), or wearing white clothing to a north american or european funeral (where black is the color of mourning)? 
what is vision, other than the interpretation of a natural phenomenon, a process which is shaped either by acceptance or rejection of one's own cultural influences and biases? 
which is why it is impossible to communicate a universalizable message (such as, "hey, i'm happy it's autumn!") stylistically... it's the thought that counts, right? 
and it's the thought (in this case, "hey, i'm happy it's autumn!") that you are attempting to convey through the use of what you perceive as an autumnal color scheme... but your color scheme is only one manifestation of the content that you are trying to convey, which is "hey, i'm happy (or at least know) it's autumn!" so, what is content? 
solely the message that the author is attempting to convey, regardless of the markup used to create the conduit for the content or the modality in which the content is received and perceived... and, unless content can be received by the user in his or her modality of choice, you aren't communicating with others, you're dictating to others... as for making people aware of what quote alternate unquote modalities are like, a tool such as len kasday's WAVE  , speaks silent volumes to page authors who don't own a screen reader or tracking magnifier -- an ingenious eye AND ear opening experience -- try reading the flow of a poorly defined page to another person who isn't looking at your monitor, and you'll see slash hear what an impressive thing len's done... kynn, i'm not saying that there isn't a place for the graphical mind set on the web, but it shouldn't be allowed to become the bedrock upon which the web itself is built... the visual is only one output modality, and by far, probably the most expensive, in terms of display and quality of reproduction, etc., so it's a matter of survival for page authors to begin to think in terms of device independence, interoperability, and usability (of which accessibility is, if not a subset, then a facet) -- if the majority of the world either doesn't speak an author's stylistic language or can't interact with an author's pages in the way the author intended (namely, on a system capable of faithfully reproducing his or her handiwork when encoded in a standards compliant markup language, rendered by a standards compliant user agent) to whom is that author speaking? 
so, rather than stating, as you did, that, quote: The problem facing web designers is not "making the textual information accessible", it's "making the page look like what I want it to look like." unquote if web designers fail to consider interoperability and usability (which, of course, includes accessibility--one's a subset of the other!) when creating content for the web; AND if they don't insist that the tools they use to create content and the tools available to individuals to receive content adhere to standards (including the User Agent and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines); AND if they don't stop to consider why some of us, mantra-like, constantly harp upon the separation of style from content, the problem for a lot of people involved in web design today will ultimately be, "how do i pay my rent?" gregory.

What's on my bookshelf? 
http://kynn.com/books/ 
in the end, kynn, what is more important? 
that the visitor to your site receive the content you wish to share, or that your page is rendered with absolute fidelity on every machine that hits your page? 
Leading question, really. 
Are you willing to accept an answer that does not agree with your own? 
In truth, what is more important _will vary from author to author_ and if we try to tell authors that their importance levels are worthless to us, we are as bad as if they try to tell us that the disabled are a worthless audience. 
if i am accessing your content, why should you care whether i appreciate your autumnal color scheme or not? 
Well, maybe I want to evoke a specific reaction through colors. 
Maybe I want to let you know that I update the page every now and then. 
Maybe I am demonstrating the power of stylesheets. 
You probably haven't noticed, but I tend to cycle through my color choices every couple of months by changing the CSS. 
People have told me they _enjoy_ that. 
I'm not sure why you sound as if you are out to _deny_ them that enjoyment. 
Yes, I'm purposely misinterpreting you here, but I also feel that the implications of your current approach lead to a rhetoric which _insists_ that visual design is worthless and has no value, and if we say that, we have lost the battle right there. 
But that's not what we're talking about here. 
We're talking about the difference between two approaches -- one which works fairly reliably on most browsers, and one which does not. 
Let's look at it by benefits: HTML Presentation - Displays in older browsers - Displays in newer browsers - *Does not* display in wireless devices CSS Presentation - *Does not* display in older (pre 4.0) browsers - Displays in newer browsers (with bugs) - *Does not* display in wireless devices So, either approach is going to work in newer browsers, and neither approach will work in wireless devices. 
But what we are talking about here is the Netscape 3 browser -- the older browser which DOES display HTML markup, and which does not display CSS. 
By these criteria, for anyone who _does_ place a priority on graphical design, CSS is an inferior method to putting color and font choices in body and table tags. 
yes, styling is part of the package, and has a place in design, but it should not be the make-or-break point for page authors... and if it is, don't complain to the WAI -- 
The WAI are the ones saying "thou shalt use CSS" which is a broken technology. 
If you ask me, we probably should cut our losses and give up on CSS because the situation is not likely to improve. 
Insisting on CSS as The One True Way has been a failure from the start. 
And keep in mind that styling may be a make or break point for many authors. 
It is a very cavalier thing for someone (especially a blind web designer) to dismiss styling as not being vitally important to the web design process. 
A number of web designers will tell you differently -- what, suddenly the whole world is wrong and the WAI are the only people with the truth? 
No wonder people get the wrong idea about web design. 
No wonder they are quick to dismiss us and find our guidelines threatening. 
so, what is content? 
solely the message that the author is attempting to convey, regardless of the markup used to create the conduit for the content or the modality in which the content is received and perceived... 
Content is in the eye of the communicator. 
Color can be content, as with my "autumn" look. 
(I'm really not sure what you would suggest as an "alternate modality" on each page which expresses the same thing.) 
and, unless content can be received by the user in his or her modality of choice, you aren't communicating with others, you're dictating to others... if web designers fail to consider interoperability and usability (which, of course, includes accessibility--one's a subset of the other!) when creating content for the web; AND if they don't insist that the tools they use to create content and the tools available to individuals to receive content adhere to standards (including the User Agent and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines); AND if they don't stop to consider why some of us, mantra-like, constantly harp upon the separation of style from content, the problem for a lot of people involved in web design today will ultimately be, "how do i pay my rent?" 
Gregory, you know I love you to pieces so when I say this, don't take it personally: It would be very nice to live in the world you describe. 
Meanwhile, back in our world, it's pure folly to suggest that lack of interoperability and lack of standard adherence is going to suddenly put a bunch of web designers out of work. 
We are vastly over-emphasizing the importance of our work if we run around with doom and gloom pronouncements like this. 
When Liz and I started Idyll Mountain Internet in 1995, most of our competitors were using scare tactics to convince potential clients that "if you don't have a web site within 6 months, you will be out of business." 
We never liked that approach and haven't ever used it. 
Guess who is out of business? 
Those competitors. 
What's my point? 
I don't think it's realistic at all to claim that web designers will be going hungry if they don't support accessibility and web standards. 
To claim otherwise is to ignore the evidence around us -- people can and will get by just fine in their jobs, thankyouverymuch, by doing what they've done all along. 
Sure, you will probably point to a few cases such as IBM's Olympics screw-up or AOL or something -- but those are rather isolated. 
The sad truth is that you can make a HUGE amount of money these days in the web industry without ever having read the HTML 4 specification. 
Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that we are going to put people out of business if they don't line up with us. 
Let's instead concentrate on how to solve the problem. 
And what's the problem? 
It's convincing web designers -- the VAST MAJORITY of whom tend to be primarily visual people -- that designing things the way we suggest is going to be better than doing it another way. 
The only way we can convince an audience of that is if we _do_ take their needs seriously, and not just write them off as crazy light- dependent artistes who are one step away from a soup kitchen because they value the appearance of their web sites.
