<s> This was a message from '96 that I found with a Google search.  </s>
<s> Was this ever implemented and how?  </s>
<s> If not, is there another way to achieve this?  </s>
<s> a) allow GET to take a body  </s>
<s> b) add a new method, GET-with-body (spelled how you like)  </s>
<s> c) allow the return value of POST to indicate that the request can be repeated safely.  </s>

<s> Having POST/PUT idempotence would be imcompatible with many applications (and the protocol itself).  </s>
<s> - Joris  </s>
<s> Since '96, several protocols have been developed which can be used to extend HTTP so that you could build an idempotent POST; PEP, RFC 2774, and SOAP.  </s>
<s> So that's one possible approach.  </s>
<s> More comments below ...  </s>
<s> GET is a different operation to POST, and means something quite incompatible with it.  </s>
<s> Except in very specific cases, I don't think that's what you'd want to do.  </s>
<s> If none of the above extension protocols are an option, I'd suggest that you should consider how to wrangle your request to use PUT, which takes a body and is idempotent.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the server could return a URI to which a PUT would be performed?  </s>
<s> Same issues with GET semantics.  </s>
<s> In my experience, an idempotent POST is most desirable in the situation where a response is not, or may not be, available.  </s>
<s> So signally it in a response after the fact seems nonsensical.  </s>
<s> But perhaps there are other use cases I'm not familiar with.  </s>

<s> Actually, idempotence is of no interest if a prior response doesn't exist .. or more precisely .. knowledge of a prior request doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> If the user-agent has no such knowledge, then idempotence isn't an issue for GET or POST.  </s>
<s> The SAFE protocol proposal allowed a server to signal that a particular POST was itempotent and could be re-issued w/o user prompting with no risk of data distortion.  </s>
<s> It also logically means that a user-agent didn't have to submit the POST request to the server if it had a valid cached response.  </s>
<s> Safe POST was the best alternative we could conceive of for allowing a logical GET w/body which is a desirable feature.  </s>
<s> For example: a.  </s>
<s> There is an expectation of a finite length for URLs ... allowing a body would have resolved those issues b.  </s>
<s> In some application interactions, such as login, it is quite undesirable to have the credential data included in a URL ... i.  </s>
<s> They tend to be easy to compromise on the user's workstation through interfaces such as the broser location field.  </s>
<s> ii.  </s>
<s> Encoded URLs usually appear in server log data ... in order to preclude such exposure applications tend to use POST requests which may not be needed otherwise Etc.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I hope this is not too much off topic, but I am currently testing my HTTP client with Microsoft IIS server.  </s>
<s> Every time I issue a POST request I get Error 405 (Method not allowed) along with an Allow response header that does not list POST in the list of allowed methods.  </s>
<s> We have tried to configure the server in several different ways - we allowed all methods for the directory to which I am POSTing, but there is no change in behavior.  </s>
<s> Can anyone shed some light on this?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Charu.  </s>
<s> I do not use MS IIS, but it sounds like you may be missing the application on the server end to accept (do something with) POSTs.  </s>
<s> On general-purpose web servers, one cannot POST to a directory or a file; there has to be a program (e.g., a CGI script) on the server side for processing of POST requests.  </s>
<s> Alex.  </s>
<s> Charu, If you are using IIS 6.0 (with Win2003), these things are turned off by default.  </s>
<s> You need to turn them on.  </s>
<s> Check for the URLScan configuration, if installed (needs to be done manually).  </s>
<s> Check whether ASP and such are actually running.  </s>
<s> Please refer to the Windows or IIS help or MS web site (knowledge base) for information.  </s>
<s> You can also try a Microsft newsgroup regarding IIS, they will probably know these kind of things.  </s>
