Registration for the technical plenary is open until 20 February. 
If you plan to attend the WCAG WG face-to-face meetings on Thursday and Friday (4 and 5 March) as well as any meetings on Monday or Tuesday or the Technical Plenary presentations on Wednesday you will need to register. 
In order to register, you will need a user name and password. 
To apply for a username and password, send me email by Tuesday, 17 February (at the latest) and I will broker the process for you. 
As we move the mailing list to use the new W3C database, everyone will need to create accounts - more on that soon.

right, registration is only open to people with a username and password. 
that's why, if you don't have one and you need to register, you need to send me an email so that i can get you set up. 
we can create public accounts that do not have the same access privileges as member accounts.
