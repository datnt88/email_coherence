<s> Now that the DOM Level 2 is nearing a stage where all that remains to be done is to make sure it can be implemented :-), here's the list of  </s>
<s> modules that the DOM WG is tackling for Level 3. Others are possible, but only if more people join to help with the work, or the ones currently on the list are resolved much more quickly than we expect.  </s>
<s> We're starting work on requirements; the first WD of level 3 will contain requirements and a few use cases to motivate them.  </s>
<s> Content models, validation: finally, the long-awaited DTD module which will also allow for validation, lexical checking, etc. Hopefully we'll be able to come up with something that can be easily extended to schemas, once they get here.  </s>
<s> View and formatting: when a user highlights something on the screen, how does the DOM know about it?  </s>
<s> Etc.  </s>
<s> Load and save: standardising the way in which a DOM implementation opens a document, and serializes it.  </s>
<s> We need to look at existing implementations, of course, to see how they've all done it.  </s>
<s> And, of course, there's Core and Events maintenance to add in the thing we'd like but didn't want to put into Level 2 for various reasons.  </s>
<s> regards, Lauren  </s>
<s> hopefully after yesterday's announcement that sun is withdrawing java from the ECMA standardization process (a process they initiated), people will choose another language for reference implementations.  </s>
<s> even if there are no suitable standards-based languages, there are certainly a number of suitable "open" alternatives (python comes to mind) that are developed in an open spirit consistent with that of the w3. thanks Brad Clawsie brad@yahoo-inc.com  </s>
<s> I don't think those of us with L2 in Java will be inclined to stop.  </s>
<s> And in any case the L2 spec needs to be implementable in both Java and JavaScript, since those are the standardized bindings.  </s>
<s> Question: how is an implementor going to know their implementation is correct, and conforms to the specification?  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> I think we all reconsider our options from time to time, and this will be seen as a negative, but until something else emerges that solves the implementor's requirements as well as Java did, it is hard to make a case for switching right away.  </s>
<s> There are no compliance tests.  </s>
<s> The spec is the sole source of info to determine whether the implementation is compliant or not.  </s>
<s> Tests would be desirable IMO, but are always incomplete, and would have to defer to the spec for additional cases, which can never be entirely covered.  </s>
<s> I think that part of this exercize is to find places where the spec is not clear enough for a developer to know whether the spec is being followed or not.  </s>

<s> It would be Really Nice to have a formal validation suite.  </s>
<s> Writing a good one is a nontrivial effort.  </s>
<s> Think of it as an opportunity for someone to contribute to the Cause...  </s>
<s> (My minimal test harness for Events wouldn't help much; it focuses on mutation events and on the corner cases in my own code, and it isn't self-analysing.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> NIST did a Level 1 test suite (only works in ECMAScript in IE at the moment) and would probably welcome feedback on it, in part to see whether they should do a test suite for Level 2... See http://www.nist.gov/xml/ for more details, including Mary Brady's email address for comments.  </s>
