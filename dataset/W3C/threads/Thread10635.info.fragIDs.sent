<s> I express interest in 1.2 whitespace, 4.1 rdf:datatype vs xsi:type 4.4 XML grammar 4.5 RDF and XML Although I expect the last two come down to charter really.  </s>

<s> A "process" comment... I note that the first URI is not publicly readable (W3 member access is required).  </s>
<s> I think all the same information is available at the second URI.  </s>
<s> With reference to Concepts-related comments: 2.1 They suggest the term "lexical mapping" instead of "datatype mapping".  </s>
<s> I see no problem with that change.  </s>
<s> 2.2 Suggestion to restrict the value space to those values for which there is a lexical form.  </s>
<s> I cannot identify any problem with this, but I'm uneasy.  </s>
<s> I think it means that applications designers must be aware of the allowed lexical forms whenever using a datatype name as a class name in RDF.  </s>
<s> I wonder if there is scope for surprises here?  </s>
<s> 2.3 Suggests describing the lexical space of datatypes as being "character sequences" rather than "strings", to reduce possibility of confusion with the datatype called "string".  </s>
<s> I think the suggested change is fine.  </s>
<s> (But  </s>
<s> I do find myself wondering if the tail is wagging the dog here; there is this common problem that when certain terms get specific technical interpretations, we are pressured to stop using them for their more common purpose.  </s>
<s> The term "model" springs to mind.)  </s>
<s> 2.4 Language tagging of strings is not enough for encoding natural language.  </s>
<s> I think this warrants discussion.  </s>
<s> I think a number of people (including myself) are uneasy about the special treatment of language tags when there may be more elegant and comprehensive ways to achieve the desired goals.  </s>

<s> I think the union case is decisive here (though depending on how one squints, one could see each value having a lexical form, even if the mapping is shadowed by that of a "preceeding" datatype).  </s>
<s> In any case, I see no reason why XML Schema cannot be more restrictive than RDF with regards to datatypes.  </s>
<s> There may be other datatyping frameworks which do not presume that all values have lexical representatations, but which will work just fine with RDF.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> So many headaches would be cured if we just ignored xml:lang entirely... Patrick  </s>
