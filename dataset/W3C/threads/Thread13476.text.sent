Hello, I finally got around to updating the issues list [1] per our telecon on Monday [2]. 
I've been going through a few more and here are my conclusions. 
We can include this as a brief discussion on Monday's telecon. 
One thing that I did different from the decision on Monday, was put #17 as an issue for xtech rather than ATAG. 
It's requesting a definition of multimedia which seems to go more with xtech than atag. 
Here are the other changes i've made: #20 Allow user to change the units of measure. 
a new technique for ATAG-TECHS, therefore ATAG issue. 
#22 Check document for missing quote markup Moved to WCAG [HTML Tech] since need guidance on use of Q . 
There was a thread in January 2001, but I don't think any resolution. 
#23. 
ABBR values should be shorter than 15 characters. 
Moved to ATAG. 
This is describing a possible technique for identifying abbreviations and if they are pronounceable. 
Looks like a someday pile and not something critical. 
#25. 
Testing embedded technologies Moved to ATAG. 
#26. 
Server-side to client-side image map conversion Moved to ATAG. 
#27. 
Logical tab order Closed. 
#31. 
Provide general information about a site Moved to ATAG #43. 
Priorities for techniques based on level of heuristics closed. 
#44. 
HTTP headers - check for refresh? 
Uncertain of the issue. 
Does anyone remember this one? 
William? 
you raised the question. 
LK took an action item, but I don't see any follow-up. 
Should we consider this closed? 
#47. 
Checking A elements for valid text content closed #48. 
Checking for quoted text Moved to ATAG. 
#50. 
Suggested repair for updating equivalents of dynamic content Moved to [WCAG Scripting Tech]. 
Although this is a discussion about repairing dynamic content, I think the definition of what it takes to be equivalent needs to come from WCAG. 
#51. 
Identifying OBJECTs Moved to ATAG #52. 
Checking for device independent event handlers Moved to WCAG [Scripting Tech] #53-60 - didn't get to yet.
