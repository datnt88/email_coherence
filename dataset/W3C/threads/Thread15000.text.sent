Hello W3C, Something to consider in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. 
The problem is described at: and the enclosed email is feedback from a sufferer. 
Does the W3C have a colour test page? 
I could expand on mine for use in tests. 
Peter Moulding ------- Start of forwarded message ------- Subject: /colour/colourblindness.html Date: 2/5/02 3:11:07 AM Name: Ian City: Oxford Country: United Kingdom Message: Good to see this - as a mildly red-green colour blind person. 
(Although interestingly I can distinguish all the colours in the very first bar of nine colours.) 
It is sometimes a source of frustration, to say the least, that colourblindness is not mentioned in the context of web design. 
That apart I am just getting acquainted with your book (two days in) but it looks good so far. 
Basically although I already had a little, playing around, experience of php and mySQL, my work has me making a web inteface to an MS SQL server database and yours looked like a good reference. 
I'll let you know if further questions come up. 
--Ian -------- End of forwarded message -------- I imagine what is needed is a validator, so that users can 'see' what their page would look like. 
thanks j.chetwynd@btinternet.com Hello Jonathan, What I envisage are pages where people with known colour discrimination problems can look at colour samples and report back on the result. 
They would identify the type of screen they use, crt, lcd, etc, and tick colour pairs that look different but not those that look the same. 
Each result would add to the information displayed and Web site developers could look to see the contrast required between colours. 
Each sample would display the HTML RGB parameter and any equivalent useful to image editors. 
People creating HTML could look for colour differences with universal acceptance and those without. 
If the information is presented as colour differentials, it could lead to a simple page where people type in their preferred colours and get the problem combinations highlighted. 
If someone wants to then take the calculations from the script and place them in to a validator, I could help. 
People creating images would get the general idea but creating an image validator would be difficult. 
Way beyond my poor brain. 
Easier to just have examples of what works and what does not. 
Peter Here is some good color-blind information. 
Web Page Design for Colour Blind Readers DO provide ALT="..." text for all your images. 
If a user cannot understand your image they can reload with images off. 
Consider using JavaScript MouseOver events to provide status-line descriptions of images- especially maps and navigation bars. 
DON'T use [red | green | brown | grey | purple] [next to | on top of | changing to] [red | green | brown | grey | purple]. 
DO have a strong, bright contrast between foreground and background colours- not only for your page text but also in your images. 
Even totally colour blind readers can differentiate similar colours which contrast bright with dark. 
DON'T use colours in images to denote special areas, such as bar charts, maps and navigation bars. 
Consider using textures or line shading instead (try the "paper" or "pattern" function in your graph or painting program). 
Alternatively, provide additional written labels. 
DO use blue, yellow, white and black if you really must use colours to distinguish items. 
These combinations are less likely to be confused than others. 
An even better web site for information on color-blindness is I hope this helps everyone. 
Thanks, Lee Roberts President/CEO Rose Rock Design, Inc. Here's a neat page that's under development by Matt Wickline, a volunteer at the HWG's AWARE Center: He says you need the following in order to get best use out of this: "frames, javascript, color monitor, color vision all required..." Send feedback to Matthew Wickline He reports some problems with Opera users. 
Enjoy!

I use Vischeck: http://www.vischeck.com/index.php 
You can run it on a web page: http://vischeck.com/vischeckURL.php3 
(has problems with CSS, frames, java etc though) or download a filter to use with Photoshop although this looks useful too: Gian Here is some good color-blind information.

Thanks, Lee Roberts President/CEO Rose Rock Design, Inc. Vischeck is a tool that can show a web page as seen by 3 different types of color deficiency: --w wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa Anyone know if it would be possible to remap colors on a page using CSS in order to compensate for a specific type of color blindness? 
Could I write a user stylesheet that would take a page where color was used to encode information and remap those colors to something a person with deuteranope could see, for example? 
Chas. 
Munat It's possible, assuming that we're only talking about CSS. 
I'd imagine you'd want something like this: (1) Download the web page and CSS page. 
Analyze it for color use. 
(2) Set up an appropriate color mapping for the specific type of color blindness. 
(3) Apply that to the page and present to the user. 
Step (3) is pretty easy. 
Step (1) is not so hard. 
Step (2) I'm not sure how hard it is, but it may be relatively easy to do. 
Unfortunately can't do it just by doing, e.g.: (x) Apply a generic style sheet to a page. 
You need to have that analysis and mapping and application process. 
Sounds like a fun challenge. 
Anyone want to give me job doing this?

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to handle CSS at all. 
I can't use it, for example, on my own web site, which (properly, I believe) doesn't encode any color in the HTML, only in CSS.

Next Book: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 http://cssin24hours.com Why? 
Why can't I just map all reds on the page -- for example -- to a known color that I can recognize? 
Granted, the color space is smaller, but how many colors are used on a web page typically? 
If I can't see reds, for example, then maybe I can map reds to a particular shade of blue and other blues to another shade of blue. 
Or better yet, maybe I could add some sort of text decoration -- an overline maybe -- to any text that was red. 
Obviously images would be a problem (another blow to text-in-images), but if CSS can override the default colors, why wouldn't this work? 
And as for mapping colors to colors, if I knew which colors were mapped to which (and it was consistent across pages), then even if a site said something such as "new items are in red," I would know that this particular shade of blue corresponded to red, so I'd still be able to get around it. 
It might not work 100% of the time, but why wouldn't it work most of the time? 
Charles F. Munat Seattle, Washington Oh, that's fine and that's what I suggested based on your initial proposal. 
Because there's no rules for color transformations built into CSS. 
I can't write something which says: ~~color: blue~~ { color: red; } Oh, well, what you suggest should work pretty reliably most of the time; the only problem is that it can't be done with CSS unless there's major changes to how CSS handles color. 
I don't know if the CSS3 color-profile model will help any. 
(Another CSS-related idea would be to attempt to recast everything in system colors.) 
Ultimately, what would work better is simply a browser plug-in for users, which transforms colors as they need 'em. 
I think this is a good idea.

There isn't any technical barrier to doing this as far as I can tell, but it doesn't work with CSS - you waould have to develop a transformation. 
(You can also do this for images, although I suspect the coding is a little more complex except for SVG where it uses CSS for colours anyway....) I suggest if you think this is a good project you take discussion to the wai-er-ig group and see where there is interest/expertise.
