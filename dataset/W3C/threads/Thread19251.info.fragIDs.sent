<s> Dear all, First let me congratulate you with your excellent browser/editor.  </s>
<s> Thanks to Amaya we were able to start 'prototype'-tagging MathML in one of products!  </s>
<s> About the fonts: The STIX working group is developing free fonts containing 2000 symbols for scientific publishing.  </s>
<s> STIX is part of STIPUB, a group of leading publishers in the field STM publishing (ACS, AIP, AMS APS, Elsevier Science and IEEE).  </s>
<s> The goal is to get rid of all the (propriety) copyright hassles for authors and publishers.  </s>
<s> The STIX fonts will be freely available for everybody.  </s>
<s> I am the representative of Elsevier Science within STIX.  </s>
<s> Elsevier Science has already started with the development of app.  </s>
<s> 900 of the 2000 fonts.  </s>
<s> Our font developer needs input from you - that is MathML browser/editor developers - about the best way to define the font specifications for your 'rendering machine'.  </s>
<s> At this moment we are stuck because we do not know how some of the symbols will used in your browser/editor.  </s>
<s> Could you please contact us ASAP.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> We would be very lucky to have free available fonts for mathematics symbols.  </s>
<s> As you know we have two different platform families and so two different fonts managements: one based on the X technology and one based on the Windows technology.  </s>
<s> At the same time we're currently investigating the Unicode support and the GTK interface.  </s>
<s> I guess you plan to deliver Unicode fonts?  </s>

<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> We'll develop Type1 and TrueType fonts.  </s>
<s> The first should suffice for UNIX platforms.  </s>
<s> We do use UNICODE numbering, but not all of our (STIX) fonts are accepted by UNICODE yet.  </s>
<s> So, we will put some of the symbols in the Private Use area (PUA).  </s>
