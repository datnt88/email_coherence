In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces, under Interface CSSPrimitiveValue, 1st para appears: "An instance of this interface can be obtained from the getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface." 
This is a bit misleading. 
The getPropertyCSSValue method return type is specified to be CSSValue, not CSSPrimitiveValue. 
I think you want to say here something like: "An instance of this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on the instance of the CSSValue interface returned from the getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface."

:"An instance of this interface can be obtained from the :getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface." 
:This is a bit misleading. 
The getPropertyCSSValue method :return type is specified to be CSSValue, not :CSSPrimitiveValue. 
I think you want to say here something like: Given that CSSPrimitiveValue is a kind of CSSValue, you can use CSSValue.getValueType() to determine which type the returned item is and perform a language specific cast against that. 
So the type is knowable without a cast. 
Perhaps the comment should read: "An instance of this interface *may* be obtained from the getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface."

:"An instance of this interface *may* be obtained from the :getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface." 
It's just be pointed out to me that 'may' is not the right word here, and should read: "An instance of this interface *might* be obtained from the getPropertyCSSValue method of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface."
