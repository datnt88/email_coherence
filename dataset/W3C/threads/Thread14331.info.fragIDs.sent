<s> I get a very strong feeling that we are all tacitly assuming that the Web and all our Guidelines, etc. assume literacy on the part of a user?  </s>
<s> Of course this is the basis of Jonathan's criticisms and also the explanation of our emphasis on "text" as being fundamental.  </s>
<s> I don't think this is "wrong" but perhaps just unremarked.  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I think there are other reasons (and I'm deriving these comments from discussions with Eric Hansen): 1) All content must be available only to eyes, only to ears, and only to fingertips.  </s>
<s> (Refer to my comments on grouping checkpoints and the category of perception and the senses.) [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JulSep/0197.html 2) Given the state of current technologies (that are readily available, not too expensive, and accurate enough), text is the best way to ensure that information can reach all of those senses.  </s>
<s> Text is not ideal for communicating all information (graphics and audio are often a lot more effective than text, some users can't read visually displayed text, deaf non-readers seem to lose entirely in this model, etc.) However, today's tools handle text characters as input much better than images of text (OCR) or voice-to-text translation (although that seems to be improving).  </s>
<s> How good is general visual-to-auditory translation?  </s>
<s> Or auditory-to-visual?  </s>
<s> Thus, I think the emphasis on text is not strictly bound to assumptions of literacy but requirements to reach eyes, ears, and fingertips.  </s>

<s> Writing ex officio again: I don't think the guidelines assume that the reader of web content must be literate.  </s>
<s> An illiterate person can in principle operate a computer via speech input and listen to speech output.  </s>
<s> What the guidelines demand is that (per Principle 4) content must not be expressed in a more complex manner than the nature of the purpose and subject matter demand; and that modality-specific (auditory/visual) presentations be provided to aid comprehension where appropriate.  </s>
<s> This reduces the over-all comprehension threshhold, but it also needs to be acknowledged that a certain ability to understand language will be necessary in order to access most (though not necessarily all) content.  </s>
<s> This is a plain and simple fact which no access strategies can overcome.  </s>
<s> However, we can try to minimize complexity, provide a consistent style of presentation, include graphical/auditory material where appropriate, etc., to aid understanding.  </s>
<s> This will not make all content accessible to all people, but it will facilitate comprehension and under certain circumstances amount to the diference between content's being accessible, or inaccessible, to particular individuals.  </s>
<s> IJ:: "Text is not ideal for communicating..." WL: I think "ideal" misses the point that it's sofa king *good* for that purpose that the Web (and our puny efforts) assume it.  </s>
<s> I think we're pretty well agreed that we can (at least effectively enough to have established an almost entirely verbal communication network) put more stuff into text than we can put text into the other obvious media.  </s>
<s> Each urge to do it the other way 'round has met with something right next to ridicule, if not scorn g .  </s>
<s> It is so widely held that speech (yes even ASL) is what identifies us as sentient and that text is a reasonable representation, for most purposes, of speech (hence the word "language" deriving from "tongue").  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> That's technology-specific, right?  </s>
<s> The fact that screenreaders exist and braille terminals exist is what lets us "use text" and assume that it will be presented somehow to people who can't see, yes?  </s>
<s> If screenreaders didn't exist -- would we need to provide an audio stream with each web page?  </s>
<s> (A serious question, because it deals with the evolution of technology and availability of that technology to various groups.  </s>
<s> If we want to be completely technology-agnostic, we'll need to consider these things.) Here's an example -- I work with a fellow (Jack Berkowitz) who used to work with DARPA projects.  </s>
<s> One of the things he's seen was a very sophisticated image recognition program that could look at a picture and tell you, for example, "this is an image of a man standing next to a tree, and a van is driving by." It could tell you what the man is wearing, what the text on the van says, and what kind of tree it is.  </s>
<s> (This is all stuff used for spy satellites and whatnot.) Now, of course, that kind of technology is not readily available.  </s>
<s> It won't be used by the common consumer for some time.  </s>
<s> However, with increases in processing power for basic machines continuing to go up, and with high technology routinely trickling down out of the research labs, there's a possibility that within 10 years all of us could have such a thing on our desktop machines.  </s>
<s> This would mean that labelling images _may no longer be necessary_ at least not as we know it today.  </s>
<s> With today's technology you could probably set up something to read most text off of navigation buttons using OCR.  </s>
<s> Longdescs?  </s>
<s> Heck, with the stuff I've described, you can pull information out of pictures without needing a longdesc.  </s>
<s> So the "poster child" for web accessibility -- the ALT attribute -- may not be necessary in the future.  </s>
<s> Will this affect our "principles"?  </s>
