<s> Hi Tex, Some notes from a quick first read... [1] A lot of the expected readers of this Q&amp;A are content authors who  </s>
<s> are struggling to learn about internationalization of web technology.  </s>
<s> Apart from the fact that they're unlikely to come across an example of it, I think listing languages like Hindi under Arabic script with no qualification is likely to create confusion for the (non-script guru) readers of this page - particularly as you don't mention it in the section "Languages that are not right-to-left" - This applies for other languages cited too.  </s>
<s> [2] Indonesian/Jawi needs some attention.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, Jawi is another name for the old 'Malay' script based on the Arabic script which was used to write the Malay language.  </s>
<s> Indonesian is a (fairly recent) derivation of Malay language.  </s>
<s> Today, however, Malay and Indonesian pretty much use Latin script (indeed only ASCII characters).  </s>
<s> So I think this is incorrect, but also I think it is misleading/confusing for the average reader of this page without further qualification.  </s>
<s> [3] "Languages that are not right-to-left" - "Languages written in scripts that are not right-to-left ".  </s>
<s> Also I think a lot of expected readers will find it useful these days if you include indic scripts here.  </s>
<s> 'Thai' could be commuted to 'South-East Asian'.  </s>
<s> You could add Georgian and Armenian, if you like.  </s>
<s> [4] "In actual fact, they are written vertically top-to-bottom in lengths of a single character, and therefore appear to be written as right-to-left.)" -- as I said before this is not necessarily the case.  </s>
<s> I have a Taiwanese newspaper here that does RTL text that is not a single character deep.  </s>
<s> (See the attachment - esp the caption of the photo to the left.) (Note also that this is bidirectional text - see 8.6% - which has the % on the right, unlike Arabic/Hebrew.)  </s>
<s> [5] Please try to describe what's useful to the reader in this context behind links such as Omniglot, Rosetta Project, etc.  </s>
<s> Hope that helps, RI Richard Ishida W3C See the W3C Internationalization FAQ page  </s>

<s> I removed Hindi.  </s>

<s> I don't know all of the scripts languages are listed in, nor the probability of one or another script being used.  </s>

<s> thanks for everyone's comments.  </s>
<s> Changes are posted.  </s>
<s> In addition to what Richard already said: - "Classical Syriac", "Modern Syriac" and "Syriac" are all one and the same script, by the point of view of information technology.  </s>
<s> I suspect which a pair of these can be seen as the same script also by the point of view of grammatology.  </s>
<s> ok, merged  </s>
<s> - AFAIK, "Indonesian" is not a script.  </s>
<s> Have you perhaps swapped the Script and Language columns on this row?  </s>
<s> removed.  </s>
<s> Came from elsewhere.  </s>
<s> - AFAIK, there is no computer character set for N'ko.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it is unlikely that a designer is asked to design a page in this language.  </s>
<s> ok. I'll leave it in for kicks.  </s>
<s> - The South Arabian script is extinct, as probably are the languages which where written with it: Hadhramautic, Himyaritic, Qatabanic, and Sabaic.  </s>
<s> I am quite confident that Sabaic is extinct.  </s>
<s> removed.  </s>
<s> - Ladino/Judezmo is most often written in the Latin alphabet, especially on a web page.  </s>
<s> Consider that the biggest Ladino communities are in Turkey and in the two Americas, where the Latin script is normally used.  </s>
<s> I don't know whether Ladinos in Israel also use the Hebrew script, but I have seen many Israeli pages about folklore where Ladino songs where only in Latin scripts.  </s>
<s> ok. I added a note at the top of the table.  </s>
<s> I may remove Ladino, or I may do something further with identifying languages that use multiple scripts.  </s>
<s> The paragraph uses both.  </s>
<s> I see Ideographic used quite a bit.  </s>
<s> But you should perhaps add information for *all* the script in Unicode and the main languages written with them.  </s>
<s> It may be less than obvious that, say, Marathi is written in the Devanagari script, and that Devanagari is written LTR.  </s>
<s> hmmm, yes.  </s>
<s> When I get more time.  </s>
<s> I actually started out that way.  </s>
<s> SUGGESTION value=$0.02  </s>
<s> It's a good one, but I can't pursue it now.  </s>
<s> I will continue to accept suggestions as to which languages and scripts should be added.  </s>
<s> If you want to give comprehensive information, it'd perhaps be better to rearrange completely the information in two separate tables, the first one mapping languages to script(s), and the second one mapping scripts to directionality: Languages table: Language: Script(s): Notes: Croatian Latin Cmp.  </s>
<s> Serbian Ladino Latin, Hebrew Also known as "Judezmo" or "Judeo-Spanish" Serbian Cyrillic, Latin Cmp.  </s>
<s> Croatian Scripts table: Script: Dir: Notes: Cyrillic LTR Hebrew RTL Latin LTR Also known as "Roman" A first draft selection of languages for table 1 could all the languages having a two-letter code in ISO 639 (http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html).  </s>
<s> Note that, e.g., Ladino would not be included.  </s>
<s> Finding out which script(s) are used for each languages could be an interesting trivia game for the members of this mailing list.  </s>
