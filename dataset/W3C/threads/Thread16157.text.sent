Locke was pleased to thank his new friend for identifying the issue as to whether: a blind man cured would recognise a cube and sphere from sight alone. 
Does anyone know of a later idea that disputes this? 
It is pythagorean in its failure to be testable, but do you know of a better test that differentiates the intellect from the senses? 
Text according to Jonathan Ree is mostly temporal due to its intellectual qualities, whereas the senses are spatial. 
If I understand him awry.

A person who was blind from birth and had no experience of seeing cubes and spheres would not recognize the difference without touching, during the early part of newly seeing. 
Part of the problem is learning to pay attention to edges as compared to other things in the environment. 
Part of the problem is the synthetic aspects of visual processing (synthesizing an "object" from the individual sequential eye movements that actually constitute seeing). 
The person would already know how to do both of these with the sense of touch. 
Although this stuff is interesting, it is not appropriate for this list, IMHO. 
Please continue the discussion, but privately, unless there is some relationship to Web matters.
