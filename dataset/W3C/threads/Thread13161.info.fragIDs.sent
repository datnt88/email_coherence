I likely will sleep through the conference! 
I would like to comment on a feature that is addressed in two different ways throughout the resources, having to do with the relationship between the "liability" and "social responsibility" points of view. 
Although my usual stance has sided with the "it's the law!" viewpoint, I also recognize the merit of complimenting folks on their being "good citizens" in these matters so: In the overview document introduction section "... Web accessibility helps organizations avoid liability" seems too much like the sort of advice one gives to help miscreants avoid prosecution or evade taxes! 
Later in the "Identify the Organization's Interests" section this stance is "softened" to "...wanting to show its leadership as a socially responsible organization" and later under "Sample Outlines for Different Environments" is the somewhat colder "avoidance of legal exposure" bullet. 
I think some way should be found to use language that doesn't appear threatening, but still informs the reader that this stuff is now, and will likely increasingly become, THE LAW. 
Whether this is accomplished by commending "good citizenship" or pointing out the sanctions of regulations and public opinion, our choices of approach should be carefully chosen. 
Love.
