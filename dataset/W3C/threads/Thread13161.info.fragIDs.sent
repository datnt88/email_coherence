<s> I likely will sleep through the conference!  </s>
<s> I would like to comment on a feature that is addressed in two different ways throughout the resources, having to do with the relationship between the "liability" and "social responsibility" points of view.  </s>
<s> Although my usual stance has sided with the "it's the law!" viewpoint, I also recognize the merit of complimenting folks on their being "good citizens" in these matters so: In the overview document introduction section "... Web accessibility helps organizations avoid liability" seems too much like the sort of advice one gives to help miscreants avoid prosecution or evade taxes!  </s>
<s> Later in the "Identify the Organization's Interests" section this stance is "softened" to "...wanting to show its leadership as a socially responsible organization" and later under "Sample Outlines for Different Environments" is the somewhat colder "avoidance of legal exposure" bullet.  </s>
<s> I think some way should be found to use language that doesn't appear threatening, but still informs the reader that this stuff is now, and will likely increasingly become, THE LAW.  </s>
<s> Whether this is accomplished by commending "good citizenship" or pointing out the sanctions of regulations and public opinion, our choices of approach should be carefully chosen.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
