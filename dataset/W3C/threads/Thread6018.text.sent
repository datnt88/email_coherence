Hi, I'm a newcomer to the list and "choreography" lingo so forgive me if I have missed some important context. 
I've been reading through the archives and noted that you're grappling with the issues of behavioural composition in a distributed context. 
I spent several years of my PhD on this issue and hope that I can help. 
The thesis describes a choreography (or coordination) language, a formal execution semantics for the language, and a prototype for a distributed, asynchronous runtime engine implementing the semantics. 
The approach does not require any central mediator because execution progresses based on partial state held at each participant. 
I've included some references to papers at the end of this email and can supply copies of those and the thesis on request. 
The third paper is preceding but related work on the business/legal aspects of implementing contracts that I think might be quite relevant to choreography use cases. 
The thesis has overview and example chapters that are fairly approachable for those without significant interest in the more formal and technical aspects of the work. 
I'll try to follup up on a few threads with more specific comments.

Can you post actual links to these texts? 
Frank Dear Andrew, Welcome from me! 
I am sure others will welcome you as well. 
It sounds to me as if the work you have done is exactly on the topic we are trying to produce a 'standards' solution for. 
Personally I would be happy with the 'technical' content of what you say below as an expansion of our 'Mission Statement'. 
This W3C WS-Choreography group has just set up a task force to look at formalisms we could base our work on. 
The lead is Frank (Francis McCabe fgm@fla.fujitsu.com) 
and you may wish to make contact with him and that 'sub-group'. 
Mike Champion (Mike.Champion@SoftwareAG-USA.com) and Monica Martin (Monica.Martin@Sun.COM) are leading an 'Inputs' task force looking at some existing languages such as WSCI, BPSS and so on. 
Hope this helps you - looks like you will have some interesting contributions to make. 
Personally I appreciate your bringing in the idea of contracts. 
I think they are very relevant, but I was waiting until the group was a bit further along before raising.

I've had quite a number of requests for web links to the work referenced in my previous email. 
There is no specific web page, but the following links might be useful: Abstracts for the first two papers with links to full text are at: If you have IEEE and ACM membership, you will be able to download the full text. 
Unfortunately, copyright prevents me from making them publically available on a web site (at least, that is my understanding of the copyright agreement) hence the "on request" in my original email. 
I've also put the PDF for my PhD up at: Ciao, AndyB
