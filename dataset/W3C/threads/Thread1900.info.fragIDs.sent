<s> We can't guarantee this as a proxy may change the order of the headers.  </s>
<s> Also, we can't guarantee that a down stream, non-mandatory proxy doesn't add a new header with an existing prefix.  </s>

<s> To be more precise, the HTTP/1.1 spec says (in section 4.2) The order in which header fields with differing field names are received is not significant.  </s>
<s> which presumably means that this is not something that can be changed in HTTP/1.X (for all X). On the other hand, it's not clear to me that an extension-aware HTTP implementation should be discarding headers as "unrecognized" before it has parsed them all.  </s>
<s> I understand that this somewhat complicates the parser, but there are other aspects of HTTP header parsing that require buffering some of the headers, and I don't see why we shouldn't expect that this is part of the solution for an extension mechanism.  </s>

<s> At the same time, we should not warp the protocol design into unnatural forms just to make possible the simplest imaginable implementation, especially for optional features of the protocol.  </s>

<s> But that is not the same case - Accept-Language is not an unrecognized header, and in event, the server doesn't need to buffer the header itself, just the header value - and can fold the values from multiple instances of the header.  </s>
