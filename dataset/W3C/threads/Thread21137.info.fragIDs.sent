You can now use fink to do a binary install of Amaya 6.1 - instructions will be updated in http://www.w3.org/2002/09/amaya-darwin later today (Australian time) but if you have fink you can just do sudo apt-get install amaya-gtk or you can use the unstable tree to compile version 7.1 - instructions are in 
the above page already if you don't know how to use the unstable tree.

great 
OroborosX looks a bit more Mac like... http://oroborosx.sourceforge.net - download and put the folder in your applications folder, then use the oroboros thing to start X and make a launcher for Amaya (they re pretty simple). 
Not yet - if you get it going you could always write one?

You have to launch ../configure instead of ../config Pay attention, by default ../configure build a GTK version so check before you have GTK libraries installed.
