Readers may be interested in my new article over at A List Apart on the failures of Macromedia's plans for accessible Flash, namely "Flash access: Unclear on the concept."

It struck me as a bit unfair. 
It seems to me that blasting companies -because- they've chosen to make improvements doesn't really encourage them to make positive steps forward. 
Now, I'm not saying that incomplete efforts should be overlooked in the name of good intentions (just ask the WCAG 1.0 document), but I think that it's premature to run an attack piece against Macromedia at this time. 
The questions asked in part two are legit and should be asked, but the assumption that Macromedia is going to screw it up seems pretty unfounded at this time. 
At the very least, let's see what kind of product they ship after having time to digest these and other issues.

i am confused. 
seems the author is trying to cover too much and be all things to all people. 
however, i think there are several issues here that should be broken apart. 
1. Flash can be made accessible. 
we did it at the United States Mint when I 
was there. 
Flash is not accessible by itself, however it is a great tool and product that can be made accessible using a technique to provide ALT text. 
2. Universal access is a concept - a seed that is being planted. 
This will take some time to fully implement. 
I am very proud that i am on the leading edge of a "revolution' to help make the web accessible to everyone. 
Until there is 'buy-in' from the companies to that make browsers to adhere to standards as being developed by the W3C, then not all the functionality will be there. 
3. I have seen significant progress made over the years form both the web browser and page authoring side. 
The biggest catalyst is the Federal Government's decision to do something about this. 
I am refereeing to the requirements in Section 508. 
Hence the State and Local government needs to follow and put some requirements into the ADA. 4. I do agree, while there are not many browsers that support the full functionality, we do have Microsoft, Adobe, and Macromedia's attention. 
However, after being on both the government and industry side, web developers are caught in the middle as they 1) Do not have the page authoring tools to apply all the requirements to accomplish this, 2) Must design for two main browsers and multiple operating systems, 3) Must become educated on how to design web sites for multiple browsers and for universal design, and 4) Fight for the funding, resources, training and support to do so. 
The funding and understanding is more apparent in the government than it is in the commercial and retail world. 
There is a huge cost to test your development under multiple browsers and this can be a cost to purchase the PCs and maintain the configuration, cost to train everyone on the multiple browsers and purchase them, cost to train the web developers, business folks and retrain new employees. 
Therefore the tools must be provided to permit rapid application development, rapid design and quality assurance. 
5. The PWD community must organize and show they exist and are an economic force to be recognized. 
This is still a fragmented audience and the realization to mobilize is now with e-commerce and call centers. 
Until the PWD community stands up and shows they are a user and economic force to be recognized, this will not impact any company's bottom line. 
6. Security and protection of data, for example, Secure Socket Layer or SSL, will require all users to upgrade and this is where the browser community or you will not be able to access their site. 
Because more and more sites are becoming dynamic, database driven, and putting information under forms via SSL, this is the number one reason why I think the argument that the web designer must design for all browsers will not be valid down the road. 
7. Here are my final comments, we are at the leading edge and WE all have improved the world, but the PWD community must stand up and be recognized because screen readers and many of the methods used do not show up on the company log files as a hit or a significant presence. 
Companies understand economics and the bottom line and the ability to create new markets, so PWD needs to organize. 
The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, and some Organizations and individuals who are in the trenches fighting cannot do it alone!

At the risk of appearing to be insensative and on the impropper side of this question, I have to ask: 1 have you talked to mm about this? 
I must confess here that I did not read the entire article only to the point where we got to the open question aire because it was unclear as to where to go. 
there was a link that spoke its self to me as: or something to that effect and above that was "beyond the press release". 
2 are you going to go after adove as well? the damage they have done here is magnificent. 
I also want to comment on braille as you have it in your article. 
braille is still the best means no matter how few people use it to deal with certain types of information. 
Also, it is a bit of a secret but braille useage is and will be on the rise so braille is something to be payed attention to. 
I take isue as well with the contention in the article that alt stands for an image. 
My view however is unpopular. 
alt should convey the same thing that the image would convey. 
for instance. 
if you have a logo for xyz you need to put xyz corporation in the alt tag. 
Lastly, this is a first attempt and should be commended and recognized as such.

unfortunately no. they two major programs that used this technique were removed because of government concern for collecing personnel information or so i heard. 
They were the interactive maps for the 50 State Quarter and Golden Dollar Program. 
however the technique is utilized in the WCAG techniques document. 
let me know if i can be of any other assistance.

Rob, thanks for your input here. 
I'd like tosee site developpers make it possible for pwd to identify them selves on sites. 
I know that there are lots of places for comments and such but since ats are not loggable and the logs are what they steer by, perhaps this could be another way. 
alternately, it might be possible for browser developpers to provide a cookie factory for ats so that that info can be transferred.

cookies are not the cure all. 
corporate security and network policies may not allow them or better yet, the user may not allow them. 
secure socket layer (SSL) can also cause problems. 
basically the implementation of the cookie is important especially when it comes to session management and how information is stored on the server as well as is passed between forms.
