Hi all, 
I am trying to create Lao website using Amaya but could not find where to change the font. 
Or there is another way? 
Any suggestions will be appreciated in advance.

Using the last release, modify the text file corresponding to your platfrom in Amaya/config/ fonts.win for win fonts.gl for gl fonts.unix for unix You should change the unicode entry (the last one in the file.)

In the Amaya FAQ, entry "How to change fonts?" can probably help you to find a solution.
