<s> I'll preface this by saying that I understand that HTML-Tidy is not a "validator" per se.  </s>
<s> But it does make an "educated guess" (see the description of the "doctype" config option).  </s>
<s> So all I'm saying below is that Tidy could use a bit of "re-educating" ;).  </s>
<s> That is because S U and STRICT are deprecated in strict HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> If you want to use them, you will have to change the DTD to the loose version  </s>
<s> No, no, that's not my point.  </s>
<s> I *don't* want to use them.  </s>
<s> I didn't think they were OK in strict 4.0 (hence the ?  </s>
<s> in the subject).  </s>
<s> My point is that Tidy seems to think that they *are* OK. Here's a capture of Tidy on a test file: [C:/Temp/html] tidy strike.htm  </s>

<s> Tidy thinks it's HTML 4.0 strict.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to make sure all of my docs have *valid* DTD references, otherwise I wouldn't mind.  </s>
<s> If I add the above DOCTYPE line to the file, it doesn't change Tidy's response.  </s>
<s> For any of the other deprecated elements I get a warning: "line 10 column 1 - Warning: html doctype doesn't match content" if I try to reference HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it thinks (correctly) that they're OK in 3.2.  </s>
<s> Not for strike, s, and u, however -- it seems to think these are fine in HTML 4.0 strict.  </s>
<s> It's not a terribly big deal -- I can grep for the offending tags in the documents that come back as HTML 4.0, or I can try to get an SGML parser to do the validation (the files aren't on the internet, or I'd use validator.w3.org).  </s>
<s> But I thought people should be aware that Tidy may say your file "appears to be" 4.0 strict, when it isn't.  </s>
