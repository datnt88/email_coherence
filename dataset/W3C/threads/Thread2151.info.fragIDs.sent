<s> Section 3.1 of v10-spec-01 describes the rules for dealing with major releases, and which old ones must be supported.  </s>
<s> I would like to add a statement that also sets a time limit for supporting antique versions.  </s>
<s> For example, the HTTP/1.1 specification might say that after January 1, 1997, conforming WWW software need not support HTTP/0.9 transactions.  </s>
<s> Vendors would be free to continue to support legacy systems, but they would not be required to do so to remain conforming.  </s>
<s> Software accretions imperil the health of any software system.  </s>
<s> Occasionally scraping them away will reduce size and complexity and increase speed.  </s>

<s> What do you mean by saying, "half the transactions are for 0.9"?  </s>
<s> I think that most of the transactions are simple, and they could be processed with 0.9, but nevertheless they carry a HTTP/1.0 label.  </s>
<s> Therefore, a phasing out of 0.9 should not give much problems, at least IMNSHO.  </s>
