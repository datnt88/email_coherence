I'm starting a list of URI implementations[1]. 
The only one I know of is the one I wrote for Tcl[2]. 
Does anyone know of any others? 
By implementation I mean something that can resolve relative URIs, probably break URIs into parts and maybe do some other related things. 
I'm sure this kind of stuff must be out there, especially for things like RDF parsers. 
If you wrote, or know of something similar to this, please email me so I can add it to the list.

Gisle Aas perl implementation at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=URI is worth mentioning (does support data: schema too) Alberto For Perl: Author: Gisle Aas Greetings, Stefan I noticed that you didn't include a Java URI implementation on your page. 
I happened to write one just a week ago for a project i'm working on, so i bundled it up and placed it here: Feel free to add/critique/use this at will.
