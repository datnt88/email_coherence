It is time that the WAI site made determined efforts to make the site accessible to people more graphically inclined and thus show the way to other academic or text based sites. 
Jonathan, can you show us how, by creating a mock-up of the WAI home page -- http://www.w3.org/WAI/ -- and posting it on the web, and sending email that explains exactly what changes you made, why you made those changes, and how they are meeting the needs of people with cognitive disabilities?

I have already done this. 
and posteds the address FYI please take a look and perhaps you will care to comment: 
it is not intended as more than a discussion piece. 
The main point is that there are few links and not too much text. 
Obviously many more pages would be needed. 
It is an alternative entry point rather than the only one.

That's not a version of the page I requested -- the page I requested (the one you SEEMED to be talking about) was the home page of the Web Accessibility Initiative. 
Here's the URL: Can you show me how to make that page accessible? 
Are you trying to say that the principles are: 1. Break it down into smaller pages, and 2. Use graphical icons?

Members might like to contact one of these CD colleagues. 
They have all done extensive research in the area of graphics, communication and IT. 
I have found them very helpful and encouraging. 
Sally and Richard are both promoting the use of graphics with emails for CD. 
They also are keen to promote the use of powerpoint presentations. 
Members will readily recognise that ppp use few words and concentrates on the synopsis and presentation. 
Chris is promoting the means of communication, including the web for CD Sally Paveley The Advisory Unit: Computers in Education 126 Gt North Rd Hatfield Herts AL9 5JZ Web Site www.advisory-unit.org.uk
