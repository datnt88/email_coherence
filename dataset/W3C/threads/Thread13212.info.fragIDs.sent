<s> There's been objections to various checkpoints on the basis of various types of hardships: e.g. time and diffculty to implement, danger to intellectual property, conflict with artistic visions.  </s>
<s> What I'll call "considerations X" These are all legitimate concerns.  </s>
<s> But I bet we can come up with these problems for every single guideline.  </s>
<s> For example, there are objections to textual equivalents.  </s>
<s> A few years ago I wrote Scott Adams asking for textual equivalents to his on line Dilbert comics.  </s>
<s> He refused on intellectual property grounds: he felt it would make it too easy for people to make illegal copies of the dialog.  </s>
<s> Similarly, a store may want to print sale prices as graphical text, without textual equivalents, to foil robotic screenscrapers that go hunting for competitive information.  </s>
<s> Or guideline 2, separate content from presentation.  </s>
<s> Again, makes it easier for the screenscraping robotic thieves, or people who want to take your content and make it look like theirs (the next step after framed content).  </s>
<s> Or guideline 3, ease of comphrehension.  </s>
<s> Constrains artistic freedom... James Joyce would never have gotten past this guideline (the ghost of WCAG 1.0/checkpoint 3.1 returneth).  </s>
<s> Guideline 4, ease of navigation.  </s>
<s> I have heard web designers say quite seriously that they want you to go bouncing around a lotta pages to be exposed to max impulse buying stimuli.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5, device independence... well, as soon as we see gamepad interfaces flying users thru 3D interfaces (a la Neuromancer) there may well be economic resistance to redoing the whole thing 2D discrete equivalents.  </s>
<s> As for Guideline 6, graceful degradation: see guideline 5. Now, we have to address these objections eventually.  </s>
<s> Plus the various problems that others on this list have already brought up in the checkpoint 3.1 saga, and the intellectual property concerns about exposing internal presentation rule bases.  </s>
<s> But I thought we had agreed that for now, we'd just talk about accessibility, like WCAG 1.0 said it was (cf.  </s>
<s> definitions of priorities 1,2,3).  </s>
<s> Later, we can do one of the following 1.  </s>
<s> Just say we only defining accessibility, and not considering considerations X 2. Make a blanket policy giving people dispensation to ignore checkpoints in cases where there are legitimate consideration X concerns 3. Define "qualified" compliance that refers to consderations X 4. Make a detailed catalog of all the hardships that each consideration may entail.  </s>
<s> 5. -- your suggestion here --  </s>
<s> So, bottom line: are we going to focus on accessibilty now and package up considerations X later?  </s>
<s> Yes or No?  </s>

<s> OK I'm a newcomer to this forum, and am missing out on the background to your question, so feel free to ignore me.  </s>
<s> But I went through AERT (as published at URL:http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT ) just a few hours ago with a view to posting here, and planning the next level of accessibility checking for Site Valet.  </s>
<s> On several points, it seems that AERT is - or could be - unnecessarily restrictive, in that it condemns a legitimate but often-abused technique.  </s>
<s> I'll post my comments soon, and include some examples.  </s>
<s> As to your question: it seems to me that accessibility cannot be well-served by antagonising authors.  </s>
<s> This argues for always taking Consideration X seriously, and and accommodating it wherever reasonable (I think some of the more extreme examples you suggested fall down on the reasonableness test).  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be helpful to distinguish different types of case where Consideration X may arise.  </s>
<s> I'm particularly concerned that accessibility tools shouldn't be so restrictive as to be marginalised in cases where authors are making an informed choice.  </s>
<s> * Education - the author has no idea that a construct is a problem.  </s>
<s> Guidelines and software tools have an important role.  </s>
<s> * Laziness and stupidity - the author can't be bothered.  </s>
<s> Not too much anyone can do - short of legislation.  </s>
<s> * Diplomatic considerations - "don't tell us how to do it".  </s>
<s> I mention this because your reference to Scott Adams seems rather ironic: his reaction is very much the kind of thing he is famous for lampooning!  </s>
<s> * Choice - the author sees a good reason to use a construct that AERT warns against, and that if used well will not present a problem.  </s>
<s> We should avoid making the "Accessibility" choice seem unreasonable or unduly restrictive.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm rambling - perhaps someone can give me a URL for a past thread where this has all been discussed to death before?  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Nick and all... Sorry, I sent this to the wrong list.  </s>
<s> Please pursue on the guideline list, w3c-wai-gl@w3.org where I'm posting a (slightly edited) version...  </s>
<s> I just want to make a brief reply to what Nick said though.  </s>
<s> I definitely do want to take consideration X seriously.  </s>
<s> That's what I was trying to say.  </s>
<s> The question has to do with the process we're following in the guideline group.  </s>
<s> Some people have objected to accessibility guidelines because some authors will object some of the time.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to say that we don't throw out the guideline just because there are objections in some circumstances.  </s>
<s> The question is what process we follow in the guidelines group to address considerations X. Right now it's kind of ad hoc.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm continuing this in the guidelines list.  </s>
