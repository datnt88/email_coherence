The BEST so far - I am logging off. 
-L "So far as I am concerned, "disabled access to the web" is yet another bastion of political correctness, most of which in general is well-meant but utterly lacking in basic common sense... 
I put this one almost right up there with Braille keypads at drive-up ATM machines---yes, I've seen it!" Okay, dumb question: What is the HWG? 
Where are these comments coming from? 
Thanks. 
Brandon A. Barnett Multnomah County Library ~ Community Information System Project HWG is the HTML Writers Guild, www.hwg.org for details. 
Other question: Is the forum where these messages are sent archived publicly somewhere ? 
The HTML Writers Guild (HWG) is a non-profit educational organization for those interested in Web development. 
It is not a professional association, though plenty of professionals are members. 
Individual comments should only reflect on the *individuals* that have made them, not on an organization as a whole, especially one that large. 
It cannot be expected that the entire membership of over 70,000 people will have accessibility as their first concern in Web design. 
As has been discussed here previously, market-place realities sometimes compete with that. 
So the quotes of "we've made this decision to only design for X" CAN in fact be legitimate, even if it's not popular with the disability community. 
The Guild has put forth a considerable amount of effort at educating our members on accessibility issues, and we continue to do so. 
In fact, we're currently accepting registrations for an online course on accessibility (http://www.hwg/org/services/classes). 
We're working on the issue as much or more than any other web developer group out there. 
However, nobody can guarantee full buy-in to any design philosophy.

Pointgrrl, Central Coast Webgrrls I hear this a lot. 
When I do I ask them? 
if they would suggest that the blind person just hand their credit card and pin number to the cab driver and trust them?.
