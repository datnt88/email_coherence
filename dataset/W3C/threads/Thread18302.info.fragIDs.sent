<s> This memo explains a contradiction that I see in the current guidelines -- or at least an interpretation of it -- regarding whether a component that does _not_ export the DOM can be part of a conformance claim.  </s>
<s> I consider this a 'boundary' problem regarding the subject of the claim (composite user agent or singular user agent).  </s>
<s> I think of it as closely associated with what Jon Gunderson has called the 'line in the sand'.  </s>
<s> The basic problem is that the boundary that surrounds the "subject" (short for 'subject of the claim') is solid and well-defined on one side or segment but not well-defined on other parts.  </s>
<s> I don't know if it was always a problem but its importance seem clear to me as we have allowed "composite user" agents.  </s>
<s> I have some ideas for resolution but would like to focus in this memo mainly on the problem.  </s>
<s> The Exclusion of DOM-less Components Within the Subject If I understand Jon correctly, any component _internal_ to the 'subject' (i.e., inside the subject) must export the DOM.  </s>
<s> This came up in the differing responses of Jon and Charles regarding a question that I posed.  </s>
<s> See the excerpt from Charles memo (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0360.html )below, which I have slightly reformatted and labeled with the authors - EH (Eric Hansen), JRG (Jon Gunderson), and CMN (Charles McCathieNevile).: EH: a. No DOM Support in Component of a Composite User Agent True or False: "It is possible for a user agent that does not implement the DOM to be a component of a composite user agent that achieves any of the three levels of claim (single-A, double-A, and triple-A)."  </s>
<s> JRG: False.  </s>
<s> If you do not export the DOM, you cannot comply.  </s>
<s> CMN: Actually I think it is true that a given component need not export the DOM so long as the composite agent does.  </s>
<s> EH: Answer: True (?). ... Defining Some Terms and Concepts Let us call a component that exports the DOM as a 'DOM component' and a component that does not export the DOM as a 'DOM-less component'.  </s>
<s> Thus, the current document intends that the subject consist _only of DOM components_.  </s>
<s> What happens outside the subject is somewhat immaterial because it is outside the claim.  </s>
<s> The subject may communicate with external components that are either DOM components or DOM-less components.  </s>
<s> Yet, a problem arises if a user agent developer wants to rely on a DOM-less internal component to do important work.  </s>
<s> According to the current document (or at least what I understand from Jon that it intends), that is not allowed.  </s>
<s> It is not possible for a subject to obtain any of the three conformance levels if it uses a DOM-less component.  </s>
<s> This problem does not occur (or does not become apparent) if the subject is 'singular', that is, that it consists of only one component; the one component is either a DOM component or a DOM-less component and stands or falls in consequence.  </s>
<s> Need for DOM-less Components Within the Subject Under what circumstances might a developer want to use a DOM-less component within the subject?  </s>
<s> One might want to use a DOM-less component within the subject for _performance reasons_.  </s>
<s> In W3C FAQ regarding the DOM, we read: "There is one potential downside to using the DOM: As with any generalized set of interfaces, the DOM calls can be used to solve a very wide range of problems, but may not be the optimal solution for any specific problem.  </s>
<s> The advantages of interoperability and familiarity to users will more than compensate for this in many applications, but you will find that some tasks may call for other interfaces in addition to, or instead of, the DOM.  </s>
<s> For example, your application may wish to use custom interfaces internally for performance reasons, yet be able to import/export/expose its data via the DOM for convenient access from outside." (http://www.w3.org/DOM/faq.html)  </s>
<s> Please note: "... your application may wish to use custom interfaces internally for performance reasons, yet be able to import/export/expose its data via the DOM for convenient access from outside."  </s>
<s> I could imagine many other things that a user agent developer might want to do for which performance considerations might be paramount.  </s>
<s> DOM-less Components for Rendering I think that one of the most important things that a user agent developer might want to do with a DOM-less internal component is to _render content_.  </s>
<s> The current guidelines have many checkpoints that deal with various renderings that a subject might have.  </s>
<s> For example, it has many checkpoints that are applicable if the subject happens to be capable of presenting certain media types (text, graphics, audio, video), although there is no checkpoint that requires the subject to be able to render any of them.  </s>
<s> It should be noted that while the current guidelines do not _require_ rendering of any particular media type they implicitly require rendering of _at least one media type_ because there are so many checkpoints that refer to rendering of content through the user interface, most notably checkpoint 2.1 ("Make all content available through the user interface.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]").  </s>
<s> If a subject did not render any content to the user interface, it would have a great number of inapplicable checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Yet has been no upper limit set on the number of inapplicable checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Logically, there is at least an _implicit_ requirement that a subject must render content in _at least one way_; if not, it would not meet the definition of 'user agent' ("A user agent is software that retrieves and _renders_ Web content..." [definition of 'user agent', emphasis added]).  </s>
<s> I think that for performance or other reasons the developer might want to render content such as text, graphics, audio, and video using DOM-less internal components.  </s>
<s> Are there reasons that multimedia players -- or to extend the idea of 'player' -- 'graphics players', 'text players', and 'audio players' must be required to be DOM components?  </s>
<s> Do we as a working group really want to restrict people from using DOM-less components within the subject?  </s>
<s> (Note that these are issues that we run into in rendering content visually and auditorily, the same issue could be extended to tactile/Braille renderings but that issue is not as pressing since we normally think to the braille device as being outside the subject of the claim.)  </s>
<s> The Contradiction If were to remain firm in saying that each component within the subject must be a DOM component, then this would mean that a developer who wants to use DOM-less software to render content must _integrate_ that software into a DOM component so that is it is literally part of the DOM component_.  </s>
<s> But what does one really have to do to make one piece of software, in this case, a DOM-less content rendering piece of software part of a DOM component so that it can achieve some level of conformance to the document?  </s>
<s> How can merge to the DOM-less content rendering piece into the DOM component?  </s>
<s> By putting them in the same physical package?  </s>
<s> By requiring that they come from the same vendor?  </s>
<s> By requiring that they are both put into place by the same installation routine?  </s>
<s> I think that we have already correctly decided our approach to the installation, maintenance, and upgrading of user agents should be vendor-neutral, source-neutral approach, and mechanism-independent.  </s>
<s> That is, it doesn't matter in the least where components come from or how they are pieced together.  </s>
<s> For the purpose of analyzing conformance of a user agent, it shouldn't matter, for example, whether a component or an entire subject is pieced together from a hundred different sources (Internet, CD, floppies, punch-cards, etc.) and vendors or whether it comes one a single CD from a single vendor.  </s>
<s> The conformance rating should be the same.  </s>
<s> So we end up with a situation in which is contradictory.  </s>
<s> We want every component of a subject to be a DOM component because 'DOM-fulness' is the key attribute that we want to use to determine what we allow within the subject.  </s>
<s> Yet for very practical reasons we cannot forbid user agent developers from incorporating DOM-less 'components' (patches, modules, programs, etc.) into the subject.  </s>
<s> Summary I think that we need a clear rule for determining what can or should be allowed within a component or a subject of a claim.  </s>
<s> I think the document (or at least an important interpretation of it) has used the rule that 'A  </s>
<s> subject of a claim must be composed of one or components, each of which exports the DOM.' However, I think that this leads to contradiction noted above.  </s>
<s> If we extend Jon's metaphor of 'line in the sand', I think that we need more than a line.  </s>
<s> We need a circle or at least a closed loop with a consistent set of rules for determining what we will allow to within the loop (i.e., the component or the subject of the claim).  </s>
<s> In other word, we need to more carefully define the characteristics that a subject should have before it can be seriously in the running for obtaining one of the three conformance levels.  </s>
<s> I think that this can be solved by making clear in the document that the  </s>
<s> subject as a whole must export the DOM, but any individual component may not  </s>
<s> need to export the DOM.  </s>
<s> (There may need to be further refinements,  </s>
<s> especially as they relate to information going to the user interface that  </s>
<s> does not come from the DOM.)  </s>

<s> [snipped good discussion]  </s>
<s> I agree with this.  </s>
<s> I would argue the following: 1) The subject of a claim may have many components (in fact, is likely to have more than one component).  </s>
<s> 2) Some checkpoints may not be relevant to some of the components.  </s>
<s> For instance, a component of the user agent that implements a search algorithm but has no user interface and does not maintain state in the form of a document object would not be affected by  </s>
<s> user interface or DOM requirements.  </s>
<s> However, if that functionality  </s>
<s> is available to the user, then it needs to be documented, so Guideline 11 applies.  </s>
<s> 3) The subject as a whole must satisfy the requirements of the document.  </s>
<s> The subject must export the DOM for access to the document object, whichever component or components contribute to that document object.  </s>

<s> Ian's memo [1] is attached below with my comments labeled with "EH:" [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0366.html  </s>
<s> EH: A statement like "Some checkpoints may not be relevant to some of the components" begs the question, "Which checkpoints are not relevant to which kinds of components?"  </s>
<s> You have elucidated above a principle that seems relevant to the situation involving DOM requirements.  </s>
<s> It would be But is that even really necessary?  </s>
<s> Instead of trying to define which ones are relevant either piecemeal or even in bunches, is there an even simpler approach.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you have already suggested the approach when refer, in this case to functionality/content that is "available to the user".  </s>
<s> Perhaps the document should treat the subject of the claim as a "black box" with inputs and outputs where we don't care _at all_ about the interaction between components.  </s>
<s> Inputs to the Subject: (a) Web content from the Web content author (including documenatation), (b) configuration settings and control actions from the user, (c) program control data.  </s>
<s> Outputs from the produced content (notifications, alerts, repair info), (b) revised settings, (c) work product (produced primarily through use of author-supplied content), (d) history data, (e) trash (temporary files, etc.), (e) DOM export, (f) other data export as required.  </s>
<s> All output from the subject must be WCAG 1.0 conformant (at the AA-level), unless other spec is applicable (e.g., DOM export) or unless it is a 'work product' over which the user agent has no control.  </s>
<s> (Perhaps this ought to be a checkpoint.) I was going to say "If the foregoing is done properly then perhaps we don't even need to specify which checkpoints a given component helps satisfy" but I checked the 1 September UAAG document and there is no such requirement in the claim so my comment is not necessary.  </s>
<s> I suppose that the checkpoints need to be examined from the standpoint of whether there is every any instance in which we must care about the interaction between components.  </s>
<s> Eric, My original response was wrong.  </s>
<s> The composite of the components that claim conformance must export at least the author supplied context through the dom for HTML and XML based markup languages.  </s>
<s> Each component of in collection of components in the claim does not need to support the dom, but the combination of the components must.  </s>
<s> In the future the DOM may support exporting user interface information.  </s>
