<s> This is a thorny issue, as it is not clear that the priorities and conformance scheme in WCAG 1.0 is the best possible approach in this area.?

<s> I disagree: if you can't navigate to the active elements, how do you activate them?  </s>
<s> That makes it P1.  </s>
<s> I believe we used the Priority scheme in a manner largely consistent with WCAG and that it worked quite well.  </s>
<s> Sometimes it's possible to assign a priority on a "logical" basis (i.e., it's clear that if you don't do this, access will be impossible).  </s>
<s> At other times, there is more judgment involve (e.g., checkpoint 10.1 is a P1 for Level Double-A conformance of documentation to WCAG 1.0 because the WG felt that two levels were necessary and didn't choose a relative priority scheme.  </s>
<s> Or, checkpoint 6.1 is a P1 for *all* accessibility since otherwise they may never be implemented -- the UAWG decided to "take the lead" here).  </s>

<s> AG:: Streaming play.  </s>
<s> Check out pwWebSpeak.  </s>
<s> If you just play the page through, the focus auto tracks to the closest active element in the recent past of the play stream.  </s>
<s> You can activate an element any time from [when you have entered it?] to when you have passed it but are still within a given finite grace period.  </s>
<s> This is just "access to all content" and "provide activation methods associated with recognized active content."  </s>
<s> It does not require any navigation at all.  </s>
<s> In other words, isolating the focus so that activation affects a given link under certain conditions is a P1.  </s>
<s> But navigation is not.  </s>
<s> Navigation is an optimization that affects the efficiency of use.  </s>
<s> It is very important.  </s>
<s> It is not WCAG.P1.  </s>
<s> "Play it to me" is the most fundamental mode in audio access, and Navigation is a more exotic, less essential, mode of relating to the content.  </s>
<s> Ask Lloyd Rasmussen for more info on this point.  </s>
<s> Lots of talking book customers just pop it in and play it.  </s>
<s> Navigation is mode #2.  </s>
<s> You don't have to recognize the 'active elements' as elements to activate them, just recognize by the LINK pronounced before them that there is an activation opportunity.  </s>
<s> One doesn't need to know the end of the LINK nor dwell on the link in order to meet P1 levels of functionality (and above).  </s>
<s> This reveals that I have not been regarding streaming play as 'navigation,' although it does continuously move through the [default tour of] the content of the document.  </s>
<s> I may need to adjust my bin structure on this, but we should cover it in writing if this is the fix.  </s>
<s> One resolution is to clearly state that continuous play is one of the navigation methods which may be used to meet this requirement.  </s>
<s> The traceback of the logic is sorta like: The user must have access to activating any method associated with any active element.  </s>
<s> If activating the method is dependent on having the focus, then there must be a way to get focus to each such element.  </s>
<s> Navigation is a technique for getting the focus to the element.  </s>
<s> It is not necessarily the only way.  </s>
<s> The abstract requirement is that the user must be able to discover, isolate [focus] and activate any method of active element.  </s>
<s> This can happen in an abstract point-set sense, without any required reference to any more structured topology or navigation with respect to that structure.  </s>
<s> This is related to a comment I failed to write that "The P1 requirement for content search is to search all content.  </s>
<s> It does not involve any concept of 'forward,' 'backward,' or 'starting at' in its minimal form."  </s>
