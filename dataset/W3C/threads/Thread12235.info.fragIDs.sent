<s> My remaining feeling about both the "applicability" and "relative priority" is that they were fine some time back and that whatever we do is sort of like marginalia, i.e. explanations of what is meant for those who didn't "get it" from the original language - which will always include somebody, no matter how extensive the textual extensions.  </s>

<s> If the group wants to make further "elucidations" of the intent, I'll certainly go along but there is obfuscation caused by proliferation of endlessly growing volume of explanatory material designed to answer the almost infinite possible extensible questioning of every possible interpretation of each phrase used in making the document try to play to the widest possible audience of those who care to raise comparatively trivial issues concerning...(well, you get the idea!).  </s>

<s> William and Gregory, I am confused why you make the comment "...

<s> I understand your comment, I just think it should have been guided at earlier text proposed.  </s>
<s> Charles, I appreciate your constructive comment on the "... the idea that an author would be familiar with the language produced by the tool was implicitly rejected ..." and that "...that an author cannot be expected to know the nuts and bolts, only how to use a tool..." That is why I did not use the phrase "familiar with", but I used the phrase "aware of the language supported" to support the notion that a user chooses a tool because of it's capabilities which includes the "languages supported", or at least the notion that the tool supports publishing on the Web by converting RTF to HTML, or PDF, or whatever language formats the tool supports.  </s>
<s> I had thought that the assumptions going into selecting the priorities did assume that the author knew why she was using the tool and that is why I add the phrase to be explicit.  </s>
<s> I agree with Gregory when he says: "...whether or not an individual author has experience using a particular tool or a specific markup language does not materially affect the user's need to be guided, assisted, prompted, and encouraged to create accessible content ..." and I agree that needs are met when the checkpoints are implemented by the tool.  </s>
<s> In other words the selection of the checkpoints did not need to assume a particular level of user.  </s>
<s> But Gregory's statement does not explain the assumptions used to select the priority levels assigned to the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> I also agree with Gregory when he says:  </s>
<s> disabilities unquote will be able to use such tools to create accessible content ..." and that is why we have the goals stated in the document and Guideline 7. And again Gregory went on to say: "... how, then, can we expect them to be quote competent, but not necessarily an expert, user of the tool, unquote when use of such tools has been seriously curtailed, compromised, or stymied by the inaccessibility of the tool itself?"  </s>
<s> again, that is why we have priority 1 checkpoints in Guideline 7. However, I am now even more convinced that we need to document the assumptions about the level of the user [disabled or not] when we assigned the priorities.  </s>
<s> Our assumption is not "obvious" or we would not have had so many comments posted to the list.  </s>
<s> Gregory made the following assumption about the author's [tool user] skill level when he said:  </s>

<s> Because we are going to document our assumptions, I agree the verbiage should not assume too much, it should not ignore too much either, and it should not cause obfuscation by proliferation of an endlessly growing volume.  </s>
<s> I cannot support the removal of our assumptions from the document, but I can support what is in the 10 Dec draft with editorial changes: removal of the phrase "the working group has" and change "no prior" to "nominal": In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the "author" is assumed to be a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has nominal knowledge of accessibility.  </s>
<s> For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the documentation but is expected to know how to turn to the documentation for assistance.  </s>

<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> Some thoughts: 1.  </s>
<s> The word nominal is obscure.  </s>
<s> 2. It needs to make sure the reader knows that the working group already did the determining.  </s>
<s> It is not their "choice".  </s>
<s> 3. The reference to "documentation" seems out of place because it has unnecessary and it is not immediately clear why it is there.  </s>
<s> On examination one realizes that it is refering to the level of author expertise in the authoring tool (not in accessibility).  </s>
<s> Old (10 Dec 1999 draft): "In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the Working Group has assumed that "the author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has no prior knowledge of accessibility.  </s>
<s> For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the documentation but is expected to know how to turn to the documentation for assistance."  </s>
<s> New Suggestion: "In determining priority levels for checkpoints, the working group assumed that "author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that he or she has a basic knowledge of accessibility."  </s>
<s> Eric, I understand that "nominal" is an obscure term, but we went from "no prior" to "nominal" to your "a basic knowledge".  </s>
<s> Perhaps this phrase would capture the intent of "nominal" ... and that he or she has little knowledge of accessibility I think we really are assuming that the author has "almost none", or "very little if any" knowledge on accessibility.  </s>
<s> I don't even think we are assuming that the author is motivated to do accessibility, but that it will happen because of the checkpoints and because of the priorities.  </s>
<s> If we were to use the term "a basic knowledge of accessibility", I could argue that some of the priorities could be lowered - which very few of the working group wanted to re-open.  </s>
<s> I also feel that the term "no prior" is a little too absolute, because most authors are aware that people have disabilities, assistive technologies such as wheel chairs exist, and that laws exist such as the ADA in the US.  </s>
<s> Also, if we go with "no prior knowledge", some may argue that some priorities may need to be increased.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins,  </s>
<s> Phill, I agree with your bottom line here, removing "working group" and changing "no prior", although I am not sure that nominal is precisely right either - how about "the autor may have little or no knowledge of accessibility"?  </s>
