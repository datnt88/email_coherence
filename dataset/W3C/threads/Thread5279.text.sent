You can find the next (and, hopefully, close to last iteration) of the "Classes as values" note at ClassesAsValues-v3.html 
At this point, as we've agreed in the previous telecon, I would like to propose this document as an official note. 
Thanks to everyone for their comments and suggestions. 
Major changes: 1. 
I've added one more approach (approach 4) that approximates the solution by identifying the book as a book about *some* lions. 
It is indeed an approximation, but the question has come up often enough that I felt it was worth at least mentioning and explaining what's different about such an approach. 
Please take a look at the considerations there, since this stuff is all new. 
2. I've changed to real book examples, as Bernard suggested. 
I used rdfs:seeAlso to refer to the isbn site (cool resource indeed) 3. I have not used SKOS properties in approach 3 directly (avoiding the addition of another complexity level), but I have mentioned it (and also used seeAlso to point to the corresponding SKOS property). 
I hope it's a reasonable compromise. 
Natasha Alan, In Approach 1 under "Considerations" on pg 3 you have vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv o The class BookAboutAnimals has AnimalClass as an allValuesFrom range restriction for the dc:subject property: ? 
:BookAboutAnimals ????????? a?????? owl:Class ; ???????? rdfs:subClassOf ??????????????? [a?????? owl:Restriction ; ????????????????????????? owl:allValuesFrom :AnimalClass ; ?????????????????????????? owl:onProperty dc:subject????????????? ] . 
A footnote notes that if it could be about other things, then the qualifier could be "SomeValuesFrom". 
OWL's open world semantics require that a SomeValuesFrom restriction be included in any case either in this class description or in some superclass.?? 
Otherwise, there is no requirement that "BookAboutAnimals" be about anything. 
You are right of course -- my mistake. 
Thanks a lot for spotting this. 
I'll change to someValuesFrom and leave it at that. 
We will probably have a different note to discuss the proper use of all and some and the patterns for closing roles. 
So, I'd rather leave the issue out of this note.
