<s> Dear all, I spoke at the WebxTutti (Web for All) conference in Italy last week, and thought I would send my trip report here.  </s>
<s> This is a personal impression, not a formal report.  </s>
<s> The event was well-organised - instead of the anticipated 100 people there were over 200 in the audience.  </s>
<s> The event was hosted by the Ministry for Communication in Rome, was free, and was advertised as providing a full day of presentations on accessibility.  </s>
<s> The conference was in Italian, as is the Web site launched there - http://www.webxtutti.it - which is good news for the Italian speakers of the world...  </s>
<s> The presentations were of a high quality, covering a good range of important topics.  </s>
<s> Particular personal highlights included: "No Accessibilty without Usability" Because that seems to me such an important idea.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that accessibility guidelines can be replaced by user testing for most people, because most developers cannot afford the time or money to find a test audience covering the huge range of users they are trying to cater for, and then do their own interpretation of their results.  </s>
<s> A presentation on (among other things) the XML Accessibility Guidelines - draft of shortly.  </s>
<s> Several presentations on assessing accessibility of different sites using a combination of methods including automatic testing and user testing.  </s>

<s> Hello Charles, I was particularly interested in your comment about "no accessibility without usability"...  </s>
<s> It is exactly our philosophy !  </s>
<s> We try to prove to the whole earth (lol) that accessibility and particularly technical accessibility is clearly not enough to make a good experience for the impaired users.  </s>
<s> If one conceive a web site keeping in mind (and use experts for) accessibility and usability, the web experience will improve for everyone !  </s>
<s> What do you think about it ?  </s>
<s> Where can i find informations about the author of this part of the conference ?  </s>

<s> I think people generally prefer URLs to attachments.  </s>
<s> This is an accessibility issue too.  </s>
<s> Think about the time and cost needed to load an attachment when your E-mail works over a GSM connection, for example, and the E-mail program has been set to download all new messages.  </s>
<s> Well, the first question is whether we have the original author's permission to distribute and translate the document.  </s>
<s> The document appears to contain interesting points, but it would probably be much more useful if expanded from lists of items to somewhat longer running text with explanations.  </s>
<s> Anyway, when I fed the HTML document (which has apparently been created by saving a Word document in "HTML" or "Web" format) to the Systranet translator I noticed, in addition to some other problems, that the translator was unable to translate simple words like "Sulla" in some contexts - because they were immediately preceded by bullet characters in Windows encoding, assumably confusing the translator.  </s>
<s> I think this illustrates how seemingly innocent tricks in markup or in the use of characters may have impact on accessibility.  </s>
<s> (Automatic translatability is an accessibility issue too, since it helps to get over language barriers to some extent.) Jukka Korpela, senior adviser TIEKE Finnish Information Society Development Centre  </s>
<s> I will write to the guy and ask for permission to translate (and ask that WebXTutti host the translation) to an HTML version in english.  </s>

<s> All, You do raise some interesting points.  </s>
<s> I agree that I did not get permission to distribute.  </s>
<s> I apologize to anyone offended or concerned.  </s>
<s> I might have put it on a web site, but my company does not allow people like me to put anything on the web (perhaps with the indirect exception that I can create support documents that can be accessed by authorized users of our support system).  </s>
<s> To get things on a public web site takes a review by "Corporate Identity", and this would have included the check for authorization, as well as formatting and other reviews/requirements, one of which it probably would have failed (like, business need).  </s>
<s> As for the size of attachments, yes, I agree.  </s>
<s> This was about 24K bytes, a very small attachment in my current experience.  </s>
<s> I routinely have to deal with megabyte PowerPoint Slides that convey the same information content as a 1000 byte text file would.  </s>
<s> When I ran on a slow connection, my email tool allowed me to select not downloading attachments except explicitly.  </s>
<s> But, not all people run that way.  </s>
<s> But, in any case, if the user is to see the document, either it needs to be sent across the line as an email or as a web page.  </s>
<s> And, I also have the habit of not removing the text of the document to which I am replying, so these messages get increasingly long.  </s>
<s> And, yes, I just asked Microsoft Word 2000 to Save As HTML what was in the original Web page.  </s>
<s> I don't know to what HTML standard Word 2000 conforms or to what standard systranet built it's translator.  </s>
<s> All issues that do affect accessibility.  </s>
<s> Anybody following the IETF efforts to facilitate language translation?  </s>
<s> Dan Nissen  </s>
<s> Here is the referenced document in html.  </s>
<s> It is small enough so we can handle the text, I hope.  </s>
<s> But, it is still in Italian, so I can't get too much from it.  </s>
<s> Any volunteer translators?  </s>
<s> CMN: I have translated the document into english.  </s>
<s> Thanks to Michele for his permission to publish this, and for helping me clarify difficult parts of the translation.  </s>
<s> I have attached the HTML version and hope that it will be made available from the WebXTutti site.  </s>
<s> The text is below for easy reading.  </s>
<s> As I said I found this an interesting presentation.  </s>
<s> I will make a few comments on the content in a reply to this email... Chaals It isn't Accessible without Usability: For a synergy between technology and design by Michele Visciola, Etnoteam Three topics 1.  </s>
<s> On the relation between Accessibility and Usability 2. On the role of automatic evaluation tools and evaluation of Usability 3. On the relation between providing technology and a culture of Accessibility and Usability 1: On the relation between Accessibility and Usability + Developing for assistive technology does not resolve design problems + In particular, does not resolve Usability problems + In solving access problems technology can enable, but ultimately design determines the outcome Typical usability problems when using assistive technology + Auditory overload + Loss of context during navigation + Short-term memory overload + repetitive browsing patterns to avoid frustration and underutilization of important features and/or contents in the site Some typical factors encountered in good design with usability methodology (testing with real users above all) + Organisation of the page and of HTML attributes (e.g. ALT, LONGDESC) + Navigation method (e.g. Organisation of the links in a page) + How and when to enable skipping links or navigation bars + Optimisation of time taken for navigating to find information + Presentation of search results + Use of tables; automatically inserted data; space between links; use of acronyms and abbreviations; length of text; use of special characters (punctuation, parentheses, mathematical functions) Brief navigation demos with a screen reader + Government "gateway": www.governo.it  </s>
<s> + Site designed for accessibility: http://Wai.inps.it  </s>
<s> + Newspaper site: www.corriere.it  </s>
<s> + Another newspaper: www.republica.it  </s>
<s> 2: The role of Automatic Accessibility evaluation tools.  </s>
<s> + Tools available today are more or less useful for identifying things that are *not accessible* + The automatic tools seem mostly oriented towards functioning with screen readers.  </s>
<s> They don' pay much attention to other technology - not even screen magnifiers Example of things that automatic tools can't test + Organisation of the page + Presentation of the text + Navigation methods 3: On the relation between providing technology and a culture of Accessiblity and Usability + Why are there always so many problems with interaction and problems in the interface, as if there were no guidelines?  </s>
<s> + Is it really enough to rely on the goodwill of webmasters and on voluntary or special-interest groups to signal basic problems?  </s>
<s> Conclusions + There needs to be a real adherence to a culture of development based on user testing + It isn't enough to declare a site accessible: it has to be tested in practice and documented with empirical evidence  </s>
