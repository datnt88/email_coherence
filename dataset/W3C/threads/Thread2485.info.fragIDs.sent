This reminds me: if you are a browser vendor implementing (some parts of) 2109, please do *not* use language like [X] disable cookies in unverifiable transactions in your preference setting panels. 
It is not only ugly, it is imprecise as well, because 2109 talks about the option [X] disable cookies in unverifiable transactions on domains which do not domain-match the domain of the origin transaction. 
I believe I invented it), but in end-user applications you should say something like [X] disable third-party cookies 
Thanks, Koen. 
I would really hope that any browser vendor would do a much better job of providing a user interface than any of the above variants. 
There is NO WAY Joan Average-User has any way of understanding: "unverifiable transaction" "domain" "domain match" "origin transaction" Etc. 
Therefore, informed consent would be impossible. 
Actually 'unverifiable transaction' is bad spec termnology as it implies there might be a verifiable transaction. 
There was a recent suggestion 
that the transaction be refered to as an 'indirect transaction'. 
For informed consent to exist, users need: a. 
An explanation of the issues written in terms they can understand b. 
An explanation they can *easily* view as to how an individual cookie provider will use the cookies. 
Browser vendors can nicely differentiate themselves by how well they integrate the decision process for the user. 
The protocol doesn't make (b) possible and it should (e.g., the commenturl). 
Secondly, some form of the general Cookie Certificate Approach proposed to the WG should be integrated as an alternative which enables immediate acceptance of authenticated level-1 cookies preconfigured in browsers. 
It really shouldn't be difficult to get the CCA infrastructure established by the time UAs are available with the CCA support.

David W. Morris: 
Verifiable transactions do exist, and are defined by the spec. 
Koen. 
That I understand ... I guess my point wasn't clear. 
The whole notion of verifiable here is rather obscure as the english word means something to me much stronger than the usage in the spec. 
The implication is along the lines of a certificate authority having done research to verify the identity of the origin and providing a CA to that end. 
When I initially studied the various drafts, I found it confusing because I had to keep reminding myself exactly how the termnology was defined in the draft. 
As you pointed out, the concept is completely unsuitable from a UI perspective.

There is actually a proposed addition (seperate RFC?) that explores the idea of the CA type entity in this context. 
"Verifiable," in that expanded context, seems to be very appropriate.
