In section 8.10 of the Range spec the argument to the surroundContents() method is first defined as "n", and then later referred to as "node". 
Similarly, in the API specification, the argument is first defined as "newParent", but then in the descriptions of the exceptions it may throw, it is called "node" (see INVALID_NODE_TYPE_ERR and HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR). David Flanagan As you can tell by the section number I cite, I was looking at a draft, rather than the final specification. 
You can ignore this portion of my comment. 
Sorry. 
This problem, however, remains in the final version of the spec. 
David Agreed. 
newParent is clearly what was intended. 
I'd say we should accept that one as an editorial erratum. 
(If we hadn't marked "node" as being a keyword, I'd be tempted to claim this was just a sloppy phrasing of "the argument node" and let it go as suboptimal-but-harmless. 
But if we did that we should fix the markup... and if we're going to edit it at all, we should fix it properly.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research
