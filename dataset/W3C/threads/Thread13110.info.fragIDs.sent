I sympathize with William's concern about watering-down our message, but unless someone can point to some hard data I think we have to couch our message in probabilities. 
I am reasonably certain that the "Advertising Institute of America" (if 
such a body exists) has data that shows that nationwide direct-mail marketing of any product will generate more sales for that product. 
In that case, increased audience reach translates directly into increased market share. 
But in the case of a Web site people still have to come to it: i.e. potential audience. 
An accessible site only increases the size of 
the potential audience. 
I wish I could tell a company that an accessible site guarantees more site traffic, but I can't.

An increase in market share (as I understand it) is a possible consequence of reaching a wider audience, but not a given. 
I'm always struck by how "honest" we seem to be about things like this. 
Instead of "Increase your profits four-fold by making your site accessible" we insist on a disclaimer for the rather intuitively obvious claim that increasing audience will increase market. 
It's as though we are packaging accessiblity with a demurrer of the "your mileage may vary" sort.

Sure you can. 
It's the inverse of the following statement, which I consider valid: An inaccessible site decreases site traffic. 
It appears to me that you're saying something comparable to "one can't claim that traffic to a store would necessarily increase just because the owner unlocked the front door." 
Eventually, someone is going to enter where they couldn't have before. 
Now, imagine that all of your competitors' doors are locked, while yours is open. 
(This is arguably the status quo in web accessibility in many areas.) So, back to my original statement: An inaccessible site decreases site traffic -- by virtue of turning away willing visitors. 
Lost traffic represents decreased market share. 
Therefore, An accessible site increases site traffic and market share.

Actually I don't think that the initial traffic increase is what is important 
- getting people to your home page is only the first step. 
The point about accessibility is that it allows people to do something when they are there instead of searching for a competitor. 
I know that I personally have dropped several companies from my list of places to do business because their inaccessibility caused problems for me, and there are others I try to avoid if possible becuase it is annoying to stay there. 
Rather than the analogy of the door lock, think of the customer service person sitting on the desk saying "we're not interested in talking to you, do everything yourself or go away". 
Now, why do we not see that very often in a successful business or service? 
(It isn't true that I can't use inaccessible sites - most of the time I can if I only install a new browser some software I don't have. 
But I don't want to - it is easier to find a competitor in most cases. 
If I had a real accessibility requirement, of course, I would simply make a formal complaint.) Cheers Charles

In whatever case, the problem I was trying to address is our tendency to be "too objective" in these matters. 
The tone of the document could be, while not actually confrontational, at least almost enthusiastic about these benefits without necessarily emphasizing their possible "vaporosity". 
Charles' example of being turned away by the support desk is spot on. 
But we don't need to emphasize that there's no hard evidence that an accessible site will enhance market share. 
Love.
