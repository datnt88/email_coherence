<s> I have a question about the OWL test suite.  </s>
<s> In Restriction test 5 (http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/Restriction/Manifest005#test), there is a negative entailment test for the introduction of a concept name in the conclusions (it's labelled as a "mis-application of the OWL comprehension axioms").  </s>
<s> This test fails if the reasoner allows the introduction of concept in the conclusions.  </s>
<s> Conversely, in Description Logic test 901 (http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/description-logic/Manifest901#test), the positive conclusions are of the form: owl:minCardinality rdf:datatype= "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonNegativeInteger"  </s>
<s> 2 /owl:minCardinality  </s>
<s> This seems to require me to use the comprehension axioms to introduce a new concept (albeit an anonymous one), in a way that restriction test 5 says shouldn't be done.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering why this wasn't done as a consistency test, and whether there is indeed a conflict between the two tests.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ian  </s>
<s> I've done some research on the internet, without any results.  </s>
<s> Could anybody tell me what exactly are the OWL comprehension rules?  </s>
<s> And why do they impede the introduction of a concept in the conclusions?  </s>
<s> (If I missed something important in the standard documents, please accept my apology).  </s>

<s> I quick search in OWL S&amp;AS for ``comprehension'' provides a table of the Comprehension conditions (principles) in OWL.  </s>

<s> _:l2 rdf:first ex:c .  </s>
<s> _:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil .  </s>
<s> Without the first comprehension principle this entailment would not hold because ex:a rdf:type ex:b .  </s>
<s> ex:a rdf:type ex:c .  </s>
<s> would not OWL-entail _:l1 rdf:first ex:b .  </s>
<s> _:l1 rdf:rest _:l2 .  </s>
<s> _:l2 rdf:first ex:c .  </s>
<s> _:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil .  </s>
<s> i.e., there would not need to be a list containing ex:a and ex:b so there would be no way to form its intersection.  </s>
<s> Yes, this is all an artifact of having to encode OWL syntax in semantically-meaningful RDF triples.  </s>
