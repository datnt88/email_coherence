<s> Hi Are there any sites or books or papers which contain any information about the effects on accessibility by making language on web sites simpler.  </s>
<s> For example, less jargon and slang can improve things for those without Eng as a first language, and also those with limited education, the deaf, blind and so on.  </s>
<s> Is this concept simply taken as read, or are there any studies on it?  </s>
<s> Any help appreciated.  </s>

<s> Well, I don't think it is taken as read, but it is understood to be important on the Web just as it is elsewhere.  </s>
<s> There is a checkpoint in the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines: Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content.  </s>
<s> And there is ongoing discussion of this in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines group, as well as some discussion in the tools groups of methods that can be used to check this.  </s>

<s> There's been quite a bit of activity organized around the concept of "plain language".  </s>
