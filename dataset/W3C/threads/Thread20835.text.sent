Hi, Could the "Dialogue language" be chosen in the Amaya setup? 
Best regards, Barto On Tue, 15 Oct 2002 14:39:44 +0200 Not yet. 
Normally we just have to change the following line in the file Amaya\config\win-thot.rc: LANG-en Does somebody know how to do that in the setup?? Irene. 
I only wonder in what language to ask the user what language she/he likes... On Unix machines, there is an environment language which can be used. 
I bet there is something on M$WIndows machiens to. 
On the other hand, C is the best default (C, a kind of english, a lot of users might understand, not US-english, not UK-english). 
Something like: Choose your language: English / Choisissez votre langue: Fran?ais / Escoja su idioma: Espa?ol / W?hlen Sie Ihre Sprache: Deutsch / etc. 
If it's part of an installation program/wizard, just make a dialog with no title, and each language named in that language. 
Most people will work out that they should choose the option they can read, not any of the ones they can't. 
* English * Fran?ais * Espa?ol * Deutsch If you wanted to the really clever, the OK button would change name with the current selection :-) Scott
