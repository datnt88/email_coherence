<s> The application I've been interested in is the ability to help mitigate the  </s>
<s> problem of a proliferation of some open source software licenses.  </s>
<s> OSI [1] is being asked to approve more licenses than it can evidently handle.  </s>
<s> Many of the licenses differ with respect to the owner, and trivial and substantive variances.  </s>
<s> It would be interesting if a vocabulary/template could be constructed that genercized the form of the license (e.g., MIT  </s>
<s> type, GPL type, IBM type without the organization listed so others can use it without ceding ownership of copyright), eliminated trivial variances, and permitted the easy combination/categorization of content.  </s>
<s> For instance,  </s>
<s> in package management formats (e.g., Debian) they try to maintain a difference between "free" and "non-free" in the FSF sense.  </s>
<s> Or, the Linux kernel now looks for similar "free" terms in the modules it loads.  </s>
<s> Giving someone the ability to say "I want the software to be OSI compliant, GPL compatible, with ownership of 'me' with a W3C type style terms" would be nifty.  </s>
<s> And then subsequent packages and derivative works could combine constituents parts more transparently.  </s>
<s> This also applies to human readable content, particularly multi-media content.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this intersects with the intent of CC, I've been awaiting some draft specification or examples to get a sense of direction.  </s>
<s> However,  </s>
<s> in reviewing the new public site [1] (nicely done!) it states, "Giving License to Creativity: Our initial goal is to provide an easy way for people (like scholars, musicians, filmmakers, and authors--from world-renowned professionals to garage-based amateurs) to announce that their works are available for copying, modification, and redistribution."  </s>
<s> and "Unlike the GPL, Creative Commons licenses will not be designed for software, but rather for other kinds of creative works: websites, scholarship, music, film, photography, literature, courseware, etc." [2] Consequently, I suppose I now have the answer.  </s>
<s> However, I'm also wondering  </s>
<s> why software was excluded, and whether the goal of CC to arrive at a *single* license, or a framework for multiple licenses with a few core one's defined?  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph, I'm metadata advisor to the Creative Commons, so I'll tell you some of what we're currently planning to do with RDF (plans may change, std.  </s>
<s> disclaimers, etc.) .  </s>
<s> I'm sure other members of the team can answer the other parts of your email.  </s>
<s> Yes, one of the things we're working on is an RDF Schema for our licenses.  </s>
<s> It will be roughly like this: work1 license license1 .  </s>
<s> license1 requires copyleft, attribution, ... .  </s>
<s> copyleft description "The license requires that each modified version of the work is ... " .  </s>
<s> I'm hoping to expand the characteristics (like copyleft, etc.) so that we can describe other licenses like the GNU GPL or the EFF OAL.  </s>
<s> Building something like Zooko's Quick Reference[1] from the RDF data is an interesting place to go.  </s>
<s> So if one were to say that MIT-style licenses were those that only required attribution and no warranty, then they'd be easy to categorize.  </s>
<s> [1] http://zooko.com/license_quick_ref.html  </s>
<s> Yep. While I doubt that our web site will be able to do that kind of thing, it should certainly lay the framework for others who are interested.  </s>
<s> Others can probably explain a little better why software was excluded.  </s>
<s> Reasons I've heard are: - a lot of work has already gone into software, and so we should focus on the more neglected stuff  </s>
<s> - software, by its nature of practicality, has a lot of issues that other content doesn't.  </s>
<s> When was the last time you bought a CD that had a shrinkwrap license disclaiming warranty?  </s>
<s> Anyway, I hope this answers some of your questions.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your interest in the project and your letter.  </s>
<s> All the best, - Aaron  </s>
<s> joseph,  </s>
<s> the aim on this round was not to get into the proliferation game, by creating our own licenses.  </s>
<s> I am eager, however, that we do develop marks for standard licenses -- GPL, apache, etc.  </s>
<s> Then we're just expressing other standard licenses, and increasing the pressure towards convergence.  </s>
<s> That is certainly in our near-term plans.  </s>

<s> Aaron and Larry, Thank you for your answers!  </s>
<s> Some follow-up questions are below which don't require immediate answers; they're the sort of questions I've had in my mind while trying to understand the direction of CC.  </s>
<s> One of the things I've been wondering is to what degree would this be used as self-labels and third-party labels (harkening back to the PICS days) .  </s>
<s> For instance, I might want the ability to self describe the license for my content, and other organizations might want to say this is "OSI certified" or "GPL compatible."  </s>
<s> Yes, this would be nifty.  </s>
<s> Question, when I register my content [1] at your site will I have to send a URI for every single Web page?  </s>
<s> Can I specifiy domains such as already done in P3P [2] (and other applications?) (Also, it'd be neat if I could feed it RSS so new content is fed to CC automatically!) [1] http://www.creativecommons.org/technology/contributor.html [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/#ref_file_processing  </s>
<s> I'd think one could take advantage of the work.  </s>
<s> Is it the (Red book non-compliant) "copy protected" CDs that have been known to crash computers?  </s>
<s> smile/ Regardless, even if for natural language content that is technical there is often a disclaimer [3].  </s>
<s> [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice-20000612#Legal_Disclaimer  </s>
<s> Some other questions I have specific to your license include questions I've encountered at the W3C including: the right of translation, annotation, reformatting (e.g., html - pdf), the right/authenticity of the submitter to assign the work under the stated license (is CC negligent/liable if abused?), and will you version the license so you can introduce a debugged one in the future, if so, is content under the old licenses also available under the new license (e.g., GPL).  </s>
<s> Responding to my part:  </s>
<s> As it is a license, it is only self-labeling, though the meaning of the self label may eventually be to link to an expression of another's contract.  </s>
