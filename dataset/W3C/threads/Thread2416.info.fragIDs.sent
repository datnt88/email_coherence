<s> The fifth HTTP/1.1 Multi-Vendor Internet Test Day is Dec 4.  </s>
<s> !!! We do have at least one 1.1 proxy for this week !!!  </s>
<s> This is the last test day before the December IETF - don't miss the chance.  </s>
<s> If you plan to participate, please register by filling out the survey form at the end of this mail, and sending it to 'httptest@agranat.com' by your close of business on Tuesday, Dec 2. I will combine them and forward them as a single mailing on Wednesday to all who signed up.  </s>
<s> If you will have multiple instances of the same implementation and configuration active, send that as one registration; if you will have different implementations or configurations active please send those separately so that it is clear just what each active system should be.  </s>
<s> Note: There is an updated list of continuously available test sites at: Send me a note to update that list.  </s>
<s> All are welcome, including 1.0 implementations (testing backward compatibility is important too).  </s>
<s> Test Day Ground Rules: - Participating systems may be configured to allow access only by announced participants for that week (if you will be using a dynamically assigned IP address, indicate this and try to specify the range from which it will be chosen).  </s>
<s> - Participants will, on request, make a reasonable effort to provide whatever relevant log or trace data they have to other participants to resolve problems.  </s>
<s> - If a problem or possible issue with another participant implementation is found, that issue will be communicated to the contact for that implementation promptly.  </s>
<s> Only if the involved participants disagree on the correct behavior or if the involved participants agree to do so will the issue be brought to the working group mailing list.  </s>
<s> - Any other disclosure of problems found with other implementations during these tests is poor form.  </s>
<s> - Communicating positive results to other participants is strongly encouraged.  </s>
<s> Additional suggestions welcome.  </s>
<s> Organization: User-Agent or Server string: (may be approximate) HTTP Role: [origin, proxy, tunnel, client, robot, ...] HTTP Version: Address: (DNS host names and/or IP addresses for the HTTP implementation) Time: (GMT times the system will be active or available) Contact Name: (person to contact with an issue) Contact Hours: (GMT times the contact is available, should overlap the span in Time, but may be a subset) Notes: other relevant information, possibly including URLs for information on where to find background material.  </s>

<s> Is this going on now - how can I contribute?  </s>
<s> I have libwww ready to handle  </s>
<s> trailers and TE and so if anybody want to test the fastest client on the market ;-) for pipelining then I would be happy to try it out.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> Sign up next week.  </s>
<s> Scott sends out a list of those participating to all participants the day before the test.  </s>
<s> Then try to find any bugs you can...  </s>
<s> Not that many clients have participated so far, so I think the server folks would be especially happy if you participated.  </s>
<s> I'd like to add some long overdue good words for the tests here (and of course many thanx to Scott for organizing them).  </s>
<s> I've been able to eliminate a number of bugs in my client, and there've been a few in most servers.  </s>
<s> I take it as a good sign that most problems have been implementation bugs, but nevertheless the tests have turned up at least one protocol problem (which has been solved).  </s>
<s> Note that no proxies have been involved in the tests (at least, not that I was aware of) so this is one area of the spec which could use some testing.  </s>
<s> I've got my client ready too - now I'm waiting for a server to implement the trailers and TE (at least I didn't find anything during the tests that included trailers or the Trailer header).  </s>
<s> Any servers out there sending trailers?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ronald  </s>
