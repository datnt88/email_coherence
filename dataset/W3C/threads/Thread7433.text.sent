Is it possible to require certain properties be supplied when creating a resource using WebDAV? 
For instance, in a CM world, requiring that every new source file revision have an accompanying comment. 
Or in the DMS world, that every document have an author and document type? 
How do you enforce this if it requires a PROPPATCH that is separate from the PUT or CHECKIN? 
We could try to enumerate every possible combination of policy into the protocol but clients wouldn't be written to support them all so interoperability goes out the window. 
Especially in the case you specify below where you essentially need transactioning or some sort of composite method in order to guarantee the policy is properly enforced. 
If you desperately need this policy, if you must have it or you just can't work, then DAV isn't for you. 
However, there is nothing which stops your clients from performing PUT/CHECKIN followed by a PROPPATCH. 
But if you are to use DAV then your server must also be able to handle clients who don't necessarily PROPPATCH the properties your need. 
This, unfortunately, is one of the compromises that having an open interoperable standard requires. 
Yaron These might better be considered client application responsibilities that use the protocol to implement their own specific requirements and work flow.
