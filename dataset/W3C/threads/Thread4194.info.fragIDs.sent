In my 2/11 reply to your note below a few items were not addressed as these needed to be taken up by the F&amp;O task force. 
These items were discussed on 3/3 and resolved as below. 
Again, we thank you for your comments and close reading of the document. 
- For all functions that accept an optional collation argument: What happens if a collation is specified but the sequence is not 
strings? 
Is the collation just ignored? 
[AM] Agreed. 
The next draft will contain appropriate wording. 
- According to the Unicode(tm) website, Unicode(tm) is a trademark and should be designated so everywhere it is used. 
See 
[AM] There is no precedent for this in any of the XML specs. 
One of the taskforce participants said that their lawyers had told him that the trademark needed to be cited only if there was a contractual dependency between the partners. 
*** 6.2 The codepoints-to-string() and string-to-codepoints() functions are 
great, 
but they are completely underspecified. 
- What happens if the input sequence to codepoints-to-string() is 
empty? 
(Presumably the empty string, but this is not stated.) - What happens if the codepoints are not valid characters in XQuery strings, for example codepoints-to-string((0))? - What happens if the codepoints contain a combining sequence that is 
not 
valid? - What happens if the codepoints are not valid codepoints (i.e., 
outside 
the range 0-10FFFF inclusive)? 
[AM] Agreed. 
Additional semantics will be specified in the next draft. 
*** 6.4 - The following functions perform comparisons, and therefore should probably accept an optional collation argument (but currently do not): tokenize substring [this one's especially weird, because substring-after/substring-before do accept an optional collation 
argument] 
- The lower-case and upper-case functions are locale-unaware. 
Consider 
supplying another argument (collation or otherwise) to allow 
applications 
to handle locale-dependent casing (such as the famous Turkish I). 
[AM] From the minutes of the meeting: On locale-dependent casing; we will ask the author of the message to please refer to a specification that we can reference to make this change. 
(Collations do not have casing information.) Unicode TR21 defines a table that has locale-insensitive folding and mentions locale-sensitive folding. 
The editors will ask for public feedback in this area. 
- Consider adding at least title-case() and possibly also case-fold(). 
It 
is strange to select only two of the four functions described in the Unicode Case Model (TR #10). 
Both the Java and .NET 
class libraries support 
these 
functions, so there is no barrier to development. 
[AM] The taskforce did not agree to these suggestions. 
*** 14.3.1, 
14.3.2 - It's strange that sequence-deep-equal() and sequence-node-equal() 
return 
the empty sequence if either argument is the empty sequence, but 
otherwise 
return false if their two arguments have different lengths. 
I 
recommend 
against special-casing the empty sequence here. 
The empty sequence 
should 
compare true with itself, and false with every other sequence. 
[AM] Agreed. 
The next draft will contain these changes. 
All the best, Ashok

All the best, Ashok -----Original Message----- From: XQuery [mailto:xquery@attbi.com] Sent: Saturday, January 25, 2003 3:59 PM Subject: Some F&amp;O issues Apologies if some of these have been previously reported or are open issues; I did not perform due diligence and check.

have 
reported some of these already myself, I didn't keep track.) *** All sections - For all functions that accept an optional collation argument: What happens if a collation is specified but the sequence is not

[AM] Good point. 
I've put it on the F&amp;O telcon agenda.

[AM] [AM] On the agenda. 
*** 6.4 - The following functions perform comparisons, and therefore should probably accept an optional collation argument (but currently do not): tokenize [TBD] substring [this one's especially weird, because substring-after/substring-before do accept an optional collation 
argument]

[AM] We have discussed similar suggestions but they are on the agenda again. 
- Is it an error if in the quantifier {n,m}, n  m ?[AM] 
[AM] I presume this refers to the translate function. 
The semantics 
for 
this case are specified. 
- What happens if n or m exceeds the maximum integer value supported 
by 
the implementation? 
*** 14.3.1, 
14.3.2 - It's strange that sequence-deep-equal() and sequence-node-equal() 
return 
the empty sequence if either argument is the empty sequence, but 
otherwise 
return false if their two arguments have different lengths.

The empty sequence 
should 
compare true with itself, and false with every other sequence. 
[AM] This is on the agenda based on other mail. 
*** 14.4 - I found section 14.4 difficult to interpret precisely and correctly. 
Some particular problems with the wording: [AM] The text in these sections has been rewritten. 
I hope you will 
find 
that the next version of the document addresses your concerns. 
Some revision may be necessary now that we have agreed to preserve the 
timezone 
on date/time values. 
*** 14.4.3, 14.4.4 - How do min()/max() behave on the empty sequence? 
The text does not 
say. 
- Must all members really be the exact same type? 
The other functions promote all numeric types to a common type. 
- What happens if members are subtypes (e.g., subtypes of the duration types)? 
Presumably they're promoted to the appropriate duration type 
and 
the comparison performed there, but the text taken literally precludes this possibility. 
*** 14.4.2, 14.4.5 - The sum function really ought to be listed immediately before avg. 
Fine, they're in alphabetical order, blah blah. 
I'm not convinced. 
- The constraints for sum() and avg() are strangely not alike. 
- Both functions talk about timezone normalization, even though date/time/dateTime values are not allowed (because both functions 
require 
that all members be numeric or else the same type and support 
op:add(). 
The only definition of op:add() on non-numeric types in which both 
operands 
have the same types are yearMonthDuration and dayTimeDuration). 
- Similarly, both functions talk about support op:add() (and in the 
case 
of avg, division by integer). 
But clearly the numeric types and the two duration types I just mentioned are the only types that fit this bill, 
so 
the description is unnecessarily indirect. 
Cheers, Michael Brundage xquery@attbi.com 
The description of op:numeric-mod says: "If $arg2 is zero, then an error is raised [division by zero]." 
Shouldn't this say, If $arg2 is zero, and the operands are of type xs:integer or xs:decimal, then an error is raised [division by zero]." 
Because, as it says later, if they are float or double, it returns NaN rather than raising an error. 
Or is that sentence intended to be with the previous paragraph, which appears to cover only the case where the operands are integer/decimal? 
If that's the case, maybe the sentence should be moved up to that paragraph. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
The description of the fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration says in one place that it "returns the result rounded to contain only years and months." 
But it also says that "If there is a remaining number of days, they are discarded." 
These two statements seem to contradict each other. 
Does it round or not? 
Thanks, Priscilla 
In section 7.6.1.1, it says: "In string mode, the metacharacter . 
matches any character whatsoever. 
In multiline mode, the metacharacter . 
matches any character except a newline (#x0A) character. 
Suppose the input contains "hello" and "world" on two lines. 
This will not be matched by the regular expression "hello.*world" in multiline mode. 
" This appears to be old text, since string mode is no longer defined, and multiline mode no longer has anything to do with the metacharacter ".". 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Throughout F&amp;O, accommodate is misspelled; it has two m's. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Several places in F&amp;O, references are made to the special value "+INF". 
According to XML Schema, this is not a valid lexical form for float/double values - only "INF" is allowed. 
I think these references should be removed. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Several places in the XQuery language draft, there are references to "element defintions" and "attribute definitions". 
These should both use "declarations" instead of "definitions". 
Thanks, Priscilla 
In section 2.4.4.4, point #3b , of the XQuery language draft, it says: "...where ST is the simple or complex type of attribute AttributeName " Attributes can't have complex types, so "or complex" should be removed. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
I think the XQuery language draft means to use "unprefixed" every where it currently uses "unqualified", namely in the following three sentences: Section 3.7.1 
"Unqualified element names used in a direct element constructor are implicitly qualified by the default namespace for element names." 
Section 4.5 "If no default element/type namespace is declared, unqualified names of elements and types are in no namespace." 
Section 4.5 "Unqualified attribute names and variable names are in no namespace." 
Thanks, Priscilla 
In section 3.7.4 of the XQuery language draft, after the example, it says "The resulting p element..." That should be "The resulting a element". 
Thanks, Priscilla 
The description of the xmlspace declaration in the xQuery language draft says that it "controls whether boundary whitespace is preserved by element and attribute constructors" It really only applies to element constructors, at least the way boundary whitespace is currently defined. 
To be even more specific, it only applies to direct element constructors, right?. 
Perhaps this could be changed to "controls whether boundary whitespace is preserved by direct element constructors" Thanks, Priscilla 
In section 2.4.3, the XQuery language draft says: "It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an ElementName in an ElementTest if that name is not found in the in-scope element definitions unless a TypeNameOrWildcard is specified." and "It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an AttributeName in an AttributeTest if that name is not found in the in-scope attribute definitions unless a TypeNameOrWildcard is specified." 
But the error description for XP0008 reads: "It is a static error if an expression refers to a type name, function name, namespace prefix, or variable name that is not defined in the static context." which does not cover element or attribute names. 
It seems to me that a new error should be created for these 2 cases. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
The description of the treat expression in the XQuery language draft says: "During expression evaluation: If expr1 matches type1, using the SequenceType Matching rules in 2.4 Types, the treat expression returns the value of expr1; otherwise, it raises a dynamic error.[err:XP0006] 
" Then later it says: "The static type of $myaddress may be element(*, Address), a less specific type than element(*, USAddress). 
However, at run-time, the value of $myaddress must match the type element(*, USAddress) using SequenceType Matching rules; otherwise a dynamic error is raised.[err:XP0050]" 
These seem like the same situation with 2 different error messages (XP0006 and XP0050). 
Does the draft contradict itself, or am I misreading? 
Thanks, Priscilla 
The XQuery language draft says: "Each operation E1/E2 is evaluated as follows: Expression E1 is evaluated, and if the result is not a sequence of nodes, a type error is raised.[err:XP0019]" 
Shouldn't E1 be allowed to be the empty sequence? 
Can it be reworded "...if the result is not a (possibly empty) sequence of nodes..." Thanks, Priscilla 
I think that every place the Data Model draft says "complex content", it means "element-only content". 
I say this because I believe "complex content" includes both "element-only content" and "mixed content". 
For example, when describing the typed-value accessor of element nodes, it says: "If the node has a complex type with complex content, raises a type error..." but mixed content was covered by an earlier point. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Fixed. Thanks!

Priscilla: The wording for this function was changed as a result of some discussion on the QT list. 
It now reads... "This function returns the result rounded to contain only years and months. 
The calculation is as follows: first the duration is calculated as the value of an xdt:dayTimeDuration in seconds. 
Then, starting from $arg2, the maximum number of whole months in the duration is calculated rounding towards zero. 
If there are a remaining number of days, they are discarded." 
Is this OK?

Hi Ashok, Yes, now that it says "rounding towards zero" it makes more sense.
