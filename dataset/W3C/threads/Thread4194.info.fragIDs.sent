<s> Presumably they're promoted to the appropriate duration type  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> the comparison performed there, but the text taken literally precludes this possibility.  </s>
<s> *** 14.4.2, 14.4.5 - The sum function really ought to be listed immediately before avg.  </s>
<s> Fine, they're in alphabetical order, blah blah.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced.  </s>
<s> - The constraints for sum() and avg() are strangely not alike.  </s>
<s> - Both functions talk about timezone normalization, even though date/time/dateTime values are not allowed (because both functions  </s>
<s> require  </s>
<s> that all members be numeric or else the same type and support  </s>
<s> op:add().  </s>
<s> The only definition of op:add() on non-numeric types in which both  </s>
<s> operands  </s>
<s> have the same types are yearMonthDuration and dayTimeDuration).  </s>
<s> - Similarly, both functions talk about support op:add() (and in the  </s>
<s> case  </s>
<s> of avg, division by integer).  </s>
<s> But clearly the numeric types and the two duration types I just mentioned are the only types that fit this bill,  </s>
<s> so  </s>
<s> the description is unnecessarily indirect.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Michael Brundage xquery@attbi.com  </s>
<s> The description of op:numeric-mod says: "If $arg2 is zero, then an error is raised [division by zero]."  </s>
<s> Shouldn't this say, If $arg2 is zero, and the operands are of type xs:integer or xs:decimal, then an error is raised [division by zero]."  </s>
<s> Because, as it says later, if they are float or double, it returns NaN rather than raising an error.  </s>
<s> Or is that sentence intended to be with the previous paragraph, which appears to cover only the case where the operands are integer/decimal?  </s>
<s> If that's the case, maybe the sentence should be moved up to that paragraph.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> The description of the fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration says in one place that it "returns the result rounded to contain only years and months."  </s>
<s> But it also says that "If there is a remaining number of days, they are discarded."  </s>
<s> These two statements seem to contradict each other.  </s>
<s> Does it round or not?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> In section 7.6.1.1, it says: "In string mode, the metacharacter .  </s>

<s> In multiline mode, the metacharacter .  </s>

<s> Suppose the input contains "hello" and "world" on two lines.  </s>
<s> This will not be matched by the regular expression "hello.*world" in multiline mode.  </s>
<s> " This appears to be old text, since string mode is no longer defined, and multiline mode no longer has anything to do with the metacharacter ".".  </s>

<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>

<s> According to XML Schema, this is not a valid lexical form for float/double values - only "INF" is allowed.  </s>
<s> I think these references should be removed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> Several places in the XQuery language draft, there are references to "element defintions" and "attribute definitions".  </s>
<s> These should both use "declarations" instead of "definitions".  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> In section 2.4.4.4, point #3b , of the XQuery language draft, it says: "...where ST is the simple or complex type of attribute AttributeName " Attributes can't have complex types, so "or complex" should be removed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> I think the XQuery language draft means to use "unprefixed" every where it currently uses "unqualified", namely in the following three sentences: Section 3.7.1  </s>
<s> "Unqualified element names used in a direct element constructor are implicitly qualified by the default namespace for element names."  </s>
<s> Section 4.5 "If no default element/type namespace is declared, unqualified names of elements and types are in no namespace."  </s>
<s> Section 4.5 "Unqualified attribute names and variable names are in no namespace."  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> In section 3.7.4 of the XQuery language draft, after the example, it says "The resulting p element..." That should be "The resulting a element".  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> The description of the xmlspace declaration in the xQuery language draft says that it "controls whether boundary whitespace is preserved by element and attribute constructors" It really only applies to element constructors, at least the way boundary whitespace is currently defined.  </s>
<s> To be even more specific, it only applies to direct element constructors, right?.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this could be changed to "controls whether boundary whitespace is preserved by direct element constructors" Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> In section 2.4.3, the XQuery language draft says: "It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an ElementName in an ElementTest if that name is not found in the in-scope element definitions unless a TypeNameOrWildcard is specified." and "It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an AttributeName in an AttributeTest if that name is not found in the in-scope attribute definitions unless a TypeNameOrWildcard is specified."  </s>
<s> But the error description for XP0008 reads: "It is a static error if an expression refers to a type name, function name, namespace prefix, or variable name that is not defined in the static context." which does not cover element or attribute names.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that a new error should be created for these 2 cases.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> The description of the treat expression in the XQuery language draft says: "During expression evaluation: If expr1 matches type1, using the SequenceType Matching rules in 2.4 Types, the treat expression returns the value of expr1; otherwise, it raises a dynamic error.[err:XP0006]  </s>
<s> " Then later it says: "The static type of $myaddress may be element(*, Address), a less specific type than element(*, USAddress).  </s>
<s> However, at run-time, the value of $myaddress must match the type element(*, USAddress) using SequenceType Matching rules; otherwise a dynamic error is raised.[err:XP0050]"  </s>
<s> These seem like the same situation with 2 different error messages (XP0006 and XP0050).  </s>
<s> Does the draft contradict itself, or am I misreading?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> The XQuery language draft says: "Each operation E1/E2 is evaluated as follows: Expression E1 is evaluated, and if the result is not a sequence of nodes, a type error is raised.[err:XP0019]"  </s>
<s> Shouldn't E1 be allowed to be the empty sequence?  </s>
<s> Can it be reworded "...if the result is not a (possibly empty) sequence of nodes..." Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> I think that every place the Data Model draft says "complex content", it means "element-only content".  </s>
<s> I say this because I believe "complex content" includes both "element-only content" and "mixed content".  </s>
<s> For example, when describing the typed-value accessor of element nodes, it says: "If the node has a complex type with complex content, raises a type error..." but mixed content was covered by an earlier point.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> Fixed. Thanks!  </s>
