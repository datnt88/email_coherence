Yesterday I participated in a W3C/IETF coordination call where one of the topics was about the registration of mime types defined by W3C Recommendations. 
A summary of the meeting will be available soon to the W3C Membership. 
what about the IETF membership? 
Why would the process be any different for the W3C than for anybody else? 
It is perfectly possible to have a MIME registration RFC that references a non-IETF document for the actual syntax of the format. 
For example, see RFC-3240.

I was originally pursuing the strategy [2] akin to 3240 but some think the spec itself should contain the registry information, so I will move the non-boilerplate content of [2] into the W3C document, and the next version of the internet-draft will be nothing more than a one line statement saying "see appendix foo in W3C spec." 
Even so, you get into hairy situations with which spec becomes stable first, and which way the references flow under this scenario (which I try to address with [1]) though an improved process is desired by some.

Some W3C groups are trying to follow a finding[1] of the W3C's Technical Architecture Group[2], to include the media type registration form (for an IETF tree media type) within their specifications[3]. 
The process will have to be a little different if W3C working groups are to follow that finding. 
However, that *does not* mean that we are trying to subvert the IESG review required for IETF tree media types. 
We want to work together to figure out how best to tweak the process while respecting the important parts of the existing process. 
FWIW, one idea I've had is to publish the registration form as an I-D to get IESG approval, but with explicit intent of *not* taking it to RFC, and instead pasting the IESG-approved text verbatim into the relevant W3C spec. 
Thanks. 
BTW, I'm only speaking for myself, not for the W3C or any W3C working group. 
So that suggestion is mine and mine alone - if it's wildly disrespectful of the existing process, kindly disregard.

MB Some W3C groups are trying to follow a finding[1] of the W3C's Technical MB Architecture Group[2], to include the media type registration form MB (for an IETF tree media type) within their specifications[3]. 
Yes - and it is likely that this will become policy over time.

However, that *does not* mean that we are MB trying to subvert the IESG review required for IETF tree media types. 
That is correct and in fact the intent is exactly the reverse - to ensure that W3C working groups consider the media registration as part of their final deliverable, start work on it early enough, and that the media type documentation gets the same review as the rest of the specification (last call, candidate rec, AC review, etc).

That gets it into the spec eventuually; it would be better to be in the spec early on and to handle IESG comments along with other last call comments, for example.
