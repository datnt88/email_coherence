<s> Hi, A very basic question.  </s>
<s> Should the hrefs that appear within the XML content be encoded?  </s>
<s> For example, should the hrefs reported in the DAV:successor-set be URL encoded?  </s>
<s> Should the '+' and the blank in the above URLs be encoded?  </s>
<s> Rgds, Girish  </s>
<s> There are no such things as "unencoded" URLs.  </s>
<s> A URL cannot contain a space.  </s>

<s> Yes. There's no such thing as a un-encoded URI.  </s>
<s> If you un-encode it, it's not longer a URI.  </s>
