Hello there, For some time (i.e. several versions) now, Amaya has been crashing on most (if not all) of my web pages, including validated pages (valid XHTML1.0, valid CSS). 
Is there any way to know where it crashes (like using a debug option to trace what it succesfully does to infer what it could not do ?). A sample w3c-validated short page causing a crash is at On my PCs (Win98, NT4SP6a), it stays locked after displaying the loading of the osinetcode.css 
stylesheet. 
Thanks Hello Frederic from John in Niagara, Canada I was able to view your file in Amaya by downloading it and RENAMING IT TO TEST.HTM. 
I suspect that there may be an file extension name hangup in Amaya because viewing the on-line version hung up my computer as well (but did not crash it!). someone else may verify that .asp extension may cause problems --- A side note is that you may wish to look at the screen layout. 
Right now it forces a need for horizontal scrolling. 
If possible make the design ADAPT to various screen sizes by wrapping techniques.... or at least design for the current standard of 800x600 desktop which leaves about 750 pixels width to work with in a browser. 
John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Please send complaints to my legal reps Dewey, Cheatum &amp; Howe ATTN: Sue Alotte I tried saving the page to disk, and it hangs all the same. 
It displays the title of the page, a white area for the first IFRAME, the load messages for the CSS files, and stops there, whatever the name under which the file is saved. 
Before anyone asks, here are the headers returned by a request to that page. 
They look normal, don't they ? 
(the wrapping on the PICS label is in the mail client, not the headers).

This 11-lines page is W3C-validated for both XHTML1.0 and CSS, and freezes Amaya. 
This one with just 5 characters changed does not freeze Amaya. 
If I understand CSS correctly (questionable issue), this probably points to a bug in Amaya., because both forms should be correct. 
And anyway, the CSS validator accepts both. 
Fr?d?ric G. MARAND of This form: style="{ background-color: red ; }" makes no sense; there's no selector, so there should be no brackets.

Fr?d?ric G. MARAND ----- Original Message ----- the title of files, I can read your page with the next version (in progress). 
With this new version the CSS parser will generate Error/Warning like the XML or the HTML parser. 
I guess that can help the user and us. 
I guess the problem occurs within the interpretation of CSS stylesheets. 
The bug is fixed in Amaya now. 
A error/warning will be reported in the parsing error file (command Views/Show parsing errors)
