Hallo, Has anyone used Tidy for web based editing applications? 
I was wondering if it has been used as an activeX/applet/plugin. 
I'm building a web based XML editor and I plan to expand it's functionality to a document centric interface (mainly for XHTML). 
I would also need to dynamically change the configuration (xhtml or not, doctypes etc). 
I would *really* appreciate any pointing on this. 
I would also be interested to see docs describing server side implementations. 
Please accept my apologies if you believe this query has no place in this list. 
Kindest regards, Manos Hi Manos, Great questions, but perhaps I am biased. 
I have written (and support) a web based XML editor and, separately, I also use Tidy for web publishing of HTML. 
A couple things. 
My XML editor is medium-tech. 
I parse the DTD and generate a config file that drives a form generator package. 
It is good for throwing up a data entry form for simple to medium complexity XML instance docs. 
We use it to maintain data sets and parameter sets used by financial modelling tools and it works well for this purpose. 
It is also useful to decouple simple data maintenance from UI/presentation. 
We can configure XSLT pages to render a particular "Document Type" (defined as the DTD URL + the root element name). 
Document editing, however, is much more complex. 
Further, the DTD does not fully describe the document semantics (for either SGML or XML variants of HTML). 
So I ask folks to use their HTML editor of choice and run everything through Tidy at upload time. 
I also convert everything to XHTML on the way in, so that anyone can pull out document fragments using generic XML tools. 
Within the system, we just use Tidy, but this feature is still experimental. 
ActiveX is probably a decent way to go. 
I.e. you need a more response UI for document editing than HTML forms can provide. 
There is a TidyCOM component included with TidyGUI (See motivations for the SourceForge project is to build a library version of Tidy to make it simpler to integrate into browser plugins or what have you. 
See http://tidy.sourceforge.net. 
We are closing in on our "bug fix" release (which actually has significantly enhanced HTML handling). 
So work will be commencing on tidylib Real Soon Now.

Kindest regards, Manos Hi Charlie, Yes XML is supposed to enable the ease of web based development among other things but poor implementations of standards continue to make a mess out of our every day work. 
Interesting and practical. 
Can I hope for sourcecode lying around somewhere on the web? 
Let's not talk about forms, I had much trouble building that grid interface out of xhtml/css2 ;-) Okie dokie. 
I am still hoping that the java version of Tidy might be used instead of the tidy/com wrapper combo after all. 
The grid interface should work just fine in Mozilla (and I'm sure there's room for getting better thanks to a solid CSS support), it would be sad to find out all this work will be useless in other browsers. 
Also, Jtidy would be easier for me to extend. 
Anyway, I'll just start experimenting while keeping an eye on the tidy.sourceforge 
page. 
Promise I will report back with any implementation + documentation to put in the pot as well. 
Thanks for your reply. 
Kindest regards, Manos
