9: Confirm Status of Completed Actions ACTION: 2001-08-02#7 Dave Beckett With help from Art and Jan, investigate how to represent RDF/XML grammar and the specification of the transformation of RDF/XML to a graph representation. 
see: ACTION: 2001-09-28#7 Jan Grant Remove xml:base from test cases see: see: ACTION: 2001-10-19#1 DaveB ensure there is a syntax document issue dealing with unrecognized attributes in the RDF namespace.

15: Issue rdfs-constraint-properties-resources Propose that the WG resolve: The current mechanism, rdfs:ConstraintResource and rdfs:ConstraintProperty, fails to serve its original purpose and should be removed from the RDF Schema 1.0 specification. 
The accompanying text be amended accordingly. 
See: 16: Issue rdfms-resource-semantics Propose the WG close rdfms-resource-semantics on the grounds that the model theory says all that RDF is going to say about the nature of resources. 
Further specification of the nature of resources is the work of other WG's. 
See: 17: Issue rdf-equivalent-uris Whilst the WG recognises the importance of a mechanism for defining equivalence of URI's, the WG has decided it does not fit within the limited scope of its current charter. 
The WG notes that DAML+OIL has an equivalence mechanism which raises the question of which layer of the stack best suits such functionality. 
The WG also notes that by allowing cycles in rdfs:subPropertyOf and rdfs:subClassOf RDF Schema provides a related mechanism for properties and classes. 
See: 18: Issue rdf-containers-otherapproaches Propose the WG postpone rdf-containers-otherapproaches on the grounds that it is out of scope of the WG's current charter. 
See: 19: Issue rdfms-logical-formalism Propose the WG close rdfms-logical-formalism on the grounds that the model theory adequately addresses this issue. 
See: 20: Issue rdfms-logical-terminololgy Propose the WG close rdfms-logical-terminololgy on the grounds that the new terminology introduced by the model theory adequately addresses this issue. 
See: 21: Issue rdfms-reification-required Propose The WG resolves that a parser is not required to always emit statements representing a bag of reified statements for each Description element. 
A parser SHOULD emit statements describing a bag of reifed statements when an rdf:bagID is present in the description element. 
It SHOULD be possible to instruct a parser to emit bags of reified statements for all description elements. 
See: 22: Issue rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf Propose The WG resolves to postpone rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf for later consideration on the grounds that it is out of scope of its current charter to change the current RDF/XML syntax to the extent necessary to address it. 
The WG notes however that validation may be helped with various submitted (non-normative) XML schemas for RDF/XML pointed to at present in the editors draft at See: 23: Thanks and Farewell to Art This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com said: in the RDF namespace. 
I think this issue: Summary: Clarify the legality of the use of names from the RDF namespace, e.g. can rdf:Bag be used as a property or can rdf:Description be used as a property attribute etc. is close enough that the resolution will address the ACTION. 
I'm not writing the resolution now but I'm going to go for listing the entire list of the terms in the rdf/rdfs namespace(s) and defining their legal use in the XML syntax. 
So I'd consider the above ACTION complete. 
Dave bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com said: Me too. 
That's why its under agenda item 9, Confirm status of completed actions.
