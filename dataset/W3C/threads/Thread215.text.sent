Using the July/26 version of Tidy when I have things like "&amp;trade;" [Trade Mark symbol] in my source Tidy changes it to "&amp;amp;trade;", or if there is a "&amp;" in a search URL it changes it to "&amp;amp;" making the URL useless. 
Is there some different option I should pick? 
I normally use "-ium" as my options with no config file.

Actually, using the &amp;amp; in urls is exactly what the standards say to use - I just noticed this in the HTML 4.01 doc. 
And in fact, I have verified in my own case that if I use &amp;amp; in CGI URLs that they work. 
Now, as for the &amp;trade;, then I suspect that special character is no longer a supported character. 
I haven't verified it though. 
Hang on. 
Nope, it is listed in the HTML 4.01 entities, as is &amp;reg. 
Hmm - Perhaps we need to build a 'test page' for tidy that includes all the entities, all the HTML tags (used properly of course). 
That way, we feed it to tidy and if what comes out is still valid then we know tidy hasn't broken.

- - I'll check my URL's closer, seemed to be server that didn't like it not the browser. 
I'll switch my &amp;trade's to &amp;regs then. 
'trade' is listed in entities.c 
of the source code but I don't know what that actually means at this point. 
Hang on, I just and went put "&amp;trade;&amp;reg;" in a page. 
In IE4.01 it is rendered as I expected as a supper scripted "TM". 
In both netscape 4.61 and Opera 3.60 it came out as "&amp;trade;". 
All three agreed that &amp;reg; = "(R)". 
So I guess &amp;reg; it is... 
I would love to have that, just so I know what *is* proper...
