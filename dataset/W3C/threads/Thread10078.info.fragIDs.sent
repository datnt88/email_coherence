<s> The basic idea of treating rdf:XMLLiteral as a datatype means that there are two different kinds of datatypes - I(rdf:XMLLiteral) and all the other datatypes.  </s>
<s> The two different kinds of datatypes work completely differently, but there is no way of distinguishing between them.  </s>
<s> I agree with Peter here.  </s>
<s> I think that the best way to go would be to remove rdf:XMLLiteral entirely.  </s>
<s> It is a bastard amalgam of syntax and semantics that provides far greater pain than benefit.  </s>
<s> Another option, and one which I've suggested several times, is to revert the definition of XML literals to that defined by M&amp;S, that there would be no rdf:XMLLiteral datatype, but that we would have three types of literal: the two original M&amp;S types of literal, plain and XML, for which the lang tag is significant, and the new type of literal, typed literals, for which the lang tag is not significant.  </s>
<s> D-interpretations only are relevant to typed literals.  </s>
<s> Not to either plain literals or XML literals.  </s>
<s> This way, we can give the special treatment we need to XML literals without it mucking up the semantics of typed literals.  </s>

<s> Jeremy, can we do this??  </s>
<s> Note that this would then mean that we could GET RID OF LANG TAGS IN THE GRAPH ALTOGETHER.  </s>
<s> Just thought I'd mention it in passing.  </s>
<s> Reverting rdfs:XMLLiteral to M&amp;S XML literal would also allow for removing lang tags from typed literals, since there would no longer be any typed literals for which lang tags were semantically significant.  </s>
<s> This provides for a very clean distinction between traditional, M&amp;S literals, for which lang tags are included, and the new typed literals for which lang tags are not included.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Brian, Can we plan to include in that discussion my proposal to revert to M&amp;S XML literals?  </s>
<s> Given the two options -- M&amp;S XML literals and Peter's proposal -- M&amp;S literals seems the safer bet, since they are well understood and there is substantial prior implementational experience with them, and also reverting to M&amp;S XML literals is more in sync with the charter, providing a overall solution that is closer to the original definition of RDF.
