<s> I follow the rdf-interest group list and have been proposing the "Palmer Method" for including RDF/indexing information in a file pointed to by the head profile="myinfo.xml"  </s>
<s> element.  </s>
<s> This would be a good place to include  </s>
<s> the who/when/what/why/how information in the form of RDF assertions, including a claim of conformance in whatever detail we could envision - sort of like the Accessibility Description Language thing Len proposed.  </s>
<s> Since one can have more than one profile URI, there are other possibilities, but the opportunity to achieve signivicant indexing at essentially no cost is compelling.  </s>
<s> Because there is a certain amount of "security" and "trust" due to the file  </s>
<s> being in the author's password-protected space, this would be a great "I think every web authoring tool should include a standard feature where you choose a questionnaire before you click save.  </s>
<s> People would be naturally motivated to answer the questionnaire because they want their pages indexed.  </s>
<s> The save function would automatically include the RDF descriptions in the file.  </s>
<s> And there should be a way to motivate the librarian types among us to write the questionnaires."  </s>
<s> That resonates with what we've been talking about - and it could be started this week!  </s>
<s> No special languages/protocols/recommendations - just a little formatting and it doesn't have to be bulletproof because if there's RDF in there it can be mined for rather readily.  </s>
<s> No DTDs, no schemas, just a file containing certain simple formatted statements.  </s>
<s> It can grow without having a major backward compatability problem and it will be fairly simple to design forward compatability into it.  </s>
<s> If nobody finds a *fatal flaw* we already have an example in place:  </s>
<s> head profile="rdfprofile.xml"  </s>
<s> If you call up that profile in IE 5.5 or NS 6.3 it displays the contents in a way that makes it evident that any reasonably sane RDF tool would be able to extract the appropriate information.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> We could even "appropriate" some file extension like .idx or whatever and establish a precedent if needed.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Yes, there is still the caveat: head xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" profile="[...]" doesn't mean anything at the moment becase there is no schema for it, although that doesn't stop us writing one (see quick example [1]) and importing it into the namespace (especially as it is a unique attribute).  </s>
<s> Really, we need to be able to either:- 1. Embed RDF into the file in the first place 2. Link to it using XLink or some other XML reference technology.  </s>
<s> Using  </s>
<s> head profile="[...]" , meta or link isn't good enough for XML processors which haven't got a clue what they should do when they run across them.  </s>
<s> [1] Took about 5 seconds cutting and pasting stuff into this, so don't assume correctness(!) In fact, this still doesn't tell processors to grok the profile target [@@need to tie this into the XLink namespace somehow]:- rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/DC/elements/1.0/"  </s>

<s> For future extensions, user agents should consider the value to be a list even though this specification only considers the first URI to be significant.  </s>

<s> What "XML processors"?  </s>
<s> Why can't their cluelessness be abrogated?  </s>
<s> If the RDF information from head profile="[...]" exists on the Web (and we now have at least one instance thereof!) then why couldn't it be retrievable by something WELL short of an AI implementation?  </s>
<s> Even if this is labeled a "hack" it could avoid an absurd amount of "syntax  </s>

<s> whether XHTML will ever be ubiquitous.  </s>
<s> In point of fact, one could impose this "hack" on any HTML file RIGHT NOW and the resultant profiles would FOREVER be available without too much wringing of purist hands?  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> "questionnaire" scenario that Seth Russell spoke of seems very practical and whatever resulted would always be decodable, much as we can still convert a WordStar document into Word 2005 or whatever.  </s>
<s> We need a plausible mechanism for indexing such statements as "I tried this file out in Lynx 2.8.1 and it's usable therein" or "this one passed Bobby 3.0" and any later refinements of the method for doing that or niceties of how it's encoded/stored/retrieved will be transcended by the nowness of it.  </s>

<s> I suppose I meant SW processors.  </s>
<s> It will be aborogated when definitions of how to process XHTML are written.  </s>
<s> I haven't even written a Schema yet for the example of using profile, so it isn't really valid (i.e. makes too much sense) yet.  </s>

<s> I suppose, but the more independant a system is, the nore you need to describe it.  </s>

<s> I notice that rdf-interest (don't know about the *real* rdf group)  </s>

<s> We'd still be waiting.  </s>
<s> By insisting on doing something (even if it's less than perfect), I hope to raise awareness of the importance of indexing - right now.  </s>
<s> Unless there's a genuine *fatal flaw* in having a separate profile resource, I can't see why we need to wait much.  </s>

<s> Well, if right away is before you even ask me to do it...seriously it's always nice to be doing something of value.  </s>

<s> RDF is A Recomendation, and RDF Schema is close.  </s>
<s> RDF IG is just abou the only general RDF forum there is right now!  </s>
<s> No flaw, it's just a bit hacky for now (I was about to send this to RDF IG):- Maybe it was a bit naive of me to suggest XHTML can be used as an RDF language...it looks as though RDF/XML are for data, and XHTML is for documents/language.  </s>
<s> If someone wants to work on the rather fuzzy area between documents and data, then great, but it's quite hard.  </s>
<s> Approaches: 1. Add RDF to XHTML 2. Link to RDF from XHTML 3. Use XHTML as RDF 4. Transform XHTML into RDF 1 doesn't work because it won't validate (yet!), 2 doesn't work because XLink isn't supported yet, 3 works to a very small extent, but with emphasis on the "small", and 4 is a hack for now because it uses "classes", but at least it works: ple%2FConnolly%2Fsmart-home.xsl&amp;xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FPeople%2FC onnolly%2F Tough call on what is the best approach...altohugh I would suggest a combination of 3 &amp; 4 for now.  </s>
