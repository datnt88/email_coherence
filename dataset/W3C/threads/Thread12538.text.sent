Hi everyone, I have attached an idea for bringing together our two sets of categories: the tool types under the "definition of authoring tool" in the ATAG Guidelines and the tool categories we use in the ATAG Techniques. 
The idea is still rough, but I'd like to hear what people think.

Great job! 
While we're talking about definitions, I for my own education looked up some of our terms in dictionary as follows: Webster's II New Riverside Dictionary, 1996 - typical - 1. exhibiting the essential traits and characteristics of a kind, class or group 2. of or relating to a representative specimen:characteristic 3. conforming to or being a type use - 1. to put into action or service - employ for some purpose 2. employ regularly implication - user - one who does the above author - 1. someone who writes a literary work 2. someone who creates or originates anything tool - 1. an implement or machine used to do work or to perform a task 2. something regarded as necessary to the performance of one's occupational or professional tasks 3. one utilized to carry out the designs of another As we talk about glossary/definition issues, perhaps keeping the above in mind might be helpful (as a kind of "reference" for perspective? 
Best, Tim Boland NIST I have attached an idea for bringing together our two sets of categories: the tool types under the "definition of authoring tool" in the ATAG Guidelines and the tool categories we use in the ATAG Techniques. 
The idea is still rough, but I'd like to hear what people think. 
1) I like it! 
It looks much better than the existing version! 
2) I vote to have this definition in Guidelines only to remove the 8 examples + "Authoring Tool Categories" from Techs completely. 
to place the 8 examples in the Guidelines directory. 
I.e. if Guidelines is at w3.org/WAI/AU/2004/WD-ATAG20-20040120/ then the examples should be at w3.org/WAI/AU/2004/WD-ATAG20-20040120/example1.html, .../example2.html, 
etc. to change "Authoring tool" definition in Guidelines Glossary to read "See 1.1 Definition of Authoring Tool" where that title is an href. 
As for Jan's work: A) I attach my version with a couple of word changes along with a move of the 4 functions to the right. 
I think they needed to be offset visually for those skimming either online or printed copy. 
B) In Code-Level Authoring Functions, not sure what is meant by "Author may or may not control other aspects (e.g. code formatting)." 
Began to think of structure vs. presentation, but I don't think that is what you mean. 
Couldn't see anything in the existing version to clarify matters. 
C) You're missing "Constrained Editing". 
Couldn't it be argued that it fall in the new Content Management Authoring Functions? 
This type of editing uses sharply defined templates. 
Don't know if I am on shaky ground saying this. 
D) You're missing "Symbol-Level Editing". 
Could this be placed under Object-oriented functions? 
I think the definition might need a slight change. 
Not sure. 
regards, Karen Mardahl Hi Karen, Thanks for the comments. 
My comments are in-line: to have this definition in Guidelines only OK to remove the 8 examples + "Authoring Tool Categories" from Techs OK to place the 8 examples in the Guidelines directory. 
I.e. if Guidelines OK - except that the 8 examples are down to 6. to change "Authoring tool" definition in Guidelines Glossary to read OK OK This was put in so that the definition would cover totally flexible text editors such as textpad as well as tools that do some code formatting (e.g. code indentation) but still allow complete flexibility of the stuff that matters (i.e. the code itself). 
Yes, that's what I intended. 
I think this can be split over 1 and 2 in the new scheme - depending on the amount of flexibility afforded to the author. 
Cheers, Jan Hi everyone, The attached proposal has been modified according to Karen's comments. 
Category 1 has been re-worded.
