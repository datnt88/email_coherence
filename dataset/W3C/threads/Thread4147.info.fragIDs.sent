<s> A comment on the substring function: I think the 3rd example is incorrect.  </s>
<s> -INF + 3 is still -INF, so wouldn't it return ""? Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> yes, you are right.  </s>
<s> There is another error here as well: -INF is not a representation of minus infinity.  </s>
<s> It should be written fn:double("-INF") or -1 div 0 (Ashok, why not simply revert to the XPath 1.0 examples?) I've just been checking the formula, which is written as: fn:round($startingLoc) = $p  fn:round($startingLoc + fn:round($length)) whereas XPath 1.0 uses the simpler: fn:round($startingLoc) = $p  fn:round($startingLoc) + fn:round($length) I think they're equivalent, but to avoid the effort of proving it, I think it would be better to use the latter (which is more efficient because the $startingLoc only needs to be rounded once).  </s>
