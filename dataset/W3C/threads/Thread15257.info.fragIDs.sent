<s> Dear Jason, Gregg, WAI Content Guidelines Working Group, I would like to ask if the Errata for WCAG 1.0 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA) could be updated to reflect the changes in guidance so far incorporated into WCAG 2.0 (for example, the fact that the flash rate considered unacceptable for content has changed from a range of 4 to 59 hertz to a new range of 3 to 49 hertz).  </s>
<s> I am asking this as the Chair person of the EuroAccessibility Consortium's Task Force 3 who's task is to produce a harmonised European approach to evaluating the accessibility of Web content.  </s>
<s> In order to be as flexible in our approach as possible we are looking to take into account the changes in guidance being suggested in Version 2 of the guidelines, but have the issue that if we do incorporate these changes our approach would then be in breach of the guidance given in WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> We would very much like to see this matter resolved quickly, and would state again that an updated Errata would be most beneficial as everyone could work with the new material in WCAG 2.0 on the official basis that WAI considers it to be an errata to WCAG 1.0.  </s>

<s> Gregg, Interesting combination of questions.  </s>
<s> I'm going to give a quick initial answer here, but it could be worth the WCAG WG looking at more carefully.  </s>
<s> In particular it is helpful to review the entire section 7.6 of the recently updated W3C Process document that deals with modification of a W3C Recommendation: Alistair's question seems to be requesting an update of the documented errata.  </s>
<s> I believe that updating errata is usually a simple process -- for those things that fall into an easily-agreed upon category of "errata."  </s>
<s> The general example that Alistair gives -- updating the errata to reflect changes in changes in guidance incorporated into current drafts of WCAG 2.0, but not yet reviewed by W3C Membership -- is not typically what errata updates have been used for, though changes that meet the criteria specified in Section 7.6.2 of the Process document could be possible.  </s>
<s> The specific example that Alistair gives -- a potential change in the hertz range for flashes that is considered unacceptable -- would be worth examining from the perspective of those criteria.  </s>
<s> However, one would need clear information on how widely accepted the new range is, and possibly other information, if you wanted to be sure it didn't slide over into the category of something needing additional review.  </s>
<s> You seem to be asking a different question than Alistair, about an amendment to WCAG 1.0 itself, using the documented errata, and possibly also using some draft WCAG 2.0 provisions.  </s>
<s> Since the W3C Process for incorporating errata has recently been changed, it should probably be looked at anew with regard to some of the documented errata in WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> So far in each discussion that I've heard on the topic of potential errata  </s>
<s> roll-ins to WCAG 1.0, and/or development of a transition version of WCAG 1.x, I've heard no two people agree on what "obviously" should be included in an amended version.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I have missed a comprimise proposal backed by WG consensus.  </s>
<s> It can be very hard to distinguish what is errata, minor change, or substantial change; and therefore correspondingly difficult to judge which items need which level of review and approval without careful scrutiny and discussion.  </s>
<s> Debating which items fall into which categories can burn considerable amounts of Working Group time while it is making good progress towards a WCAG 2.0 Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Please note that the preparations needed to meet the review requirements described under 7.6.3 "Call for Review of an Edited Recommendation" and 7.6.4 "Call for Review of Proposed Corrections" are not trivial, and can potentially also burn considerable amounts of Working Group time.  </s>
<s> Very likely almost all draft WCAG 2.0 provisions would need review by the W3C Membership before being incorporated into a transition version.  </s>
<s> This doesn't mean that an amended version is not a good proposition; just that the likely benefits must be weighed carefully against the costs of delays in progress towards WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> You also ask to open a discussion about harmonization and transition.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> think that this is a good idea, and something that the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) can help with.  </s>
<s> EOWG has been working on a draft document called "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility" and hopes to circulate a draft for comment outside of EOWG shortly.  </s>
<s> Some of the intent behind that document is to support a transition from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> In addition we had some joint discussion on transition planning in March 2003 between WCAG WG and EOWG, and EOWG is hoping that we can have more of the same at a joint meeting at the W3C Technical Plenary in March 2004.  </s>
<s> We should probably have a joint teleconference sometime before then, since transition planning seems to be  </s>
<s> an urgent item on the agendas of both WCAG WG and EOWG.  </s>

<s> I would suggest "WCAG 1.0, Second Edition" as per a number of updated W3C specs (XHTML, XML, etc) that use such terminology.  </s>
<s> "This document is the second edition of the XHTML 1.0 specification incorporating the errata changes as of 1 August 2002.  </s>
<s> Changes between this version and the previous Recommendation are illustrated in a diff-marked version."  </s>
<s> "This second edition is not a new version of XHTML 1.0 (first published 26 January 2000).  </s>
<s> The changes in this document reflect corrections applied as a result of comments submitted by the community and as a result of ongoing work within the HTML Working Group.  </s>
<s> There are no substantive changes in this document - only the integration of various errata."  </s>
<s> "This second edition is not a new version of XML (first published 10 February 1998); it merely incorporates the changes dictated by the first-edition errata (available at as a convenience to readers.  </s>
<s> The errata list for this second edition is available at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata." "This document is a Proposed Edited Recommendation of the W3C.  </s>
<s> This third edition is not a new version of XML.  </s>
<s> As a convenience to readers, it incorporates the changes dictated by the accumulated errata (available at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata) to the Second Edition of XML 1.0, dated 6 october 2000.  </s>
<s> In addition, markup has been introduced on a significant portion of the prescriptions of the specification, clarifying when prescriptive keywords such as MUST, SHOULD and MAY are used in the formal sense defined in [IETF RFC 2119"  </s>
<s> As Joe Clark pointed out, this is what I proposed in May:  </s>
<s> This is the approach which I feel would have the greatest benefits to the working group, the Web developers, and the general public.  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0 is with us now, and is being used -- likely in an "unpatched" mode by developers, most of whom NEVER look at the errata -- and will continue to be used as WCAG 2.0 work proceeds.  </s>
<s> Once WCAG 2.0 is  </s>
<s> adopted, there is no guarantee that WCAG 1.0 will fall by the wayside; there is a lot invested in WCAG 1.0, from official policies to software tools, which will make the idea of an easy switch very hard to do for some audiences.  </s>
<s> Those audiences will benefit greatly from a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition, especially if work on WCAG 2.0 takes longer than expected.  </s>

<s> Summary: Sidar would like to see errata discussed and incorporated into a second edition, but feel that many issues which require discussion are properly dealt with either in the work on techniques, or in the development of version 2.0 of WCAG.  </s>
<s> More detailed response...  </s>
<s> There seem to be three issues in play.  </s>
<s> One is incorporating errata - "mistakes in WCAG 1 that can be readily cleared up without changing the meaning of the document" might be a working definition.  </s>
<s> A new example might be clarifying what is meant by "relative units" in checkpoint 3.4, since the CSS specification describes px as a relative unit, although the clear intention of the WCAG checkpoint is to refer to units relative to the base size definition of the user.  </s>
<s> Some more examples are in the current list of errata: As Judy pointed out, the process for dealing with these things has been recently revised, and it is now realistic to rapidly incorporate them into a second edition.  </s>
<s> From Sidar's perspective, this would be extremely helpful - in particular as a motivation to update the translations of WCAG being used in Spain and South America, and course material that we currently produce - and we feel that it should be possible without distracting the working group too much from the major task of developing WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> The second part is in making clarifications, as discussed by Kynn.  </s>
<s> The "until user agents" checkpoints are one example, but there are other areas such as what kind of metadata is actually required by checkpoint 13.2.  </s>
<s> This is more complex.  </s>
<s> There may be areas that can be readily resolved by the group, and incorporated into a second edition, as clarifications.  </s>
<s> There is one example in the current errata document.  </s>
<s> There are probably other ares better clarified by providing techniques - and we would ike to see more frequent republication of the techniques note.  </s>
<s> The third area is contentious "errors" - ones where there is currently significant discussion required, or disagreement.  </s>
<s> Correcting these takes some substantial work, and we feel it is appropriate that this work is part of the development process leading to WCAG 2. Finally, we agree that a second edition is not going to be made redundant by working on WCAG 2.0 in any reasonable time frame - the investment in and implementation of WCAG 1.0, and the time required to move to a new standard, particularly for languages other than english, where translation of documents and tools is likely to slow down the adoption even further.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, the fact that errata are known but not incorporated in a revised edition is already a problem, because many people do not read the errata.  </s>

<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> "Erratum" seems a bad choice for an update which was planned from the start -- the phrasing "Until user agents handle empty controls correctly ..." indicates that this is not a mistake per se, but a simple update.  </s>
