Checkpoint 4.7 "allow the user to configure the position of...captions..." should be a priority 2 until a reference implementation is available.

Frost The reference implementation is CSS positioning. 
There's heaps of it available.

Frost W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia i'm unclear why we should wait for a reference implementation and i'd also vote to leave the priority as is (e.g. P1) Because this is an undo burden on application developers. 
There is a great number of requirements in our user agent guidelines. 
My concern is that if we place an unrealistic burden on developers that we have difficulty gaining compliance. 
Also, if we are too demanding then we will be ignored. 
I would prefer to have this first round of User Agent guidelines accepted and implemented ASAP and to have the developers feel good about having done it. 
If nobody has done this particular requirement at all there is obviously a reason for not doing it. 
My guess is that it was too difficult to implement and that the payback was inadequate.

sorry to disagree The requirement to provide for positioning is essentialy the ability to implement the positioning pieces of CSS, including user style sheets. 
This has been demonstrated as possible a number of times. 
It relies on specifications that were endorsed by the membership two years ago. 
The User Agent guidelines describe a priority scheme which is based (solely) on the necessity for users of a particular feature. 
Development burden is not an input factor for the things people need to be able to use the web. 
I also reject the argument that if nobody has done something there is a good reason not to do it. 
Nobody had implemented HTML 12 years ago, although all the ideas had already been around for decades, and was technically feasible.
