<s> I put both of these resources under baseline control and create a baseline from them.  </s>
<s> What does the DAV:baseline-collection collection look like?  </s>
<s> Does it include "filler" collections to reach the VCRs that are under baseline control?  </s>
<s> Concretely, would it look something like: /BCs/b72/non-vcr-1/vcr-a/foo /BCs/b72/non-vcr-2/vcr-b/bar  </s>

<s> Same applies to "/" -- does it contain just non-vcr-*, or  </s>
<s> would /BCs/b72/ contain other bindings?  </s>
<s> [ this doesn't apply in the Subversion scenario, so I'm not personally worried, but it appears to be a "hole" in the draft.  </s>
<s> ] Note that my property proposal would resolve the situation.  </s>
<s> Each VCR under baseline control would have a path to its corresponding VCR in the BC.  </s>
<s> Thus, the BC could look like:  </s>
<s> /BCs/b72/1/vcr-a/foo /BCs/b72/2/vcr-b/bar (i.e. "1" and "2" are computed as a way to differentiate each disjoint set of resources)  </s>
<s> The paths attached to the "public" VCRs would be: /non-vcr-1/ n/a vcr-a/ "1/vcr-a" foo "1/vcr-a/foo" vcr-b/ "1/vcr-b" bar "1/vcr-b/bar" Hmm.  </s>
<s> Actually, to be pedantic, I only put two resources under baseline control.  </s>
<s> The BC would thus look like: /BCs/b72/1/foo /BCs/b72/2/bar  </s>

<s> Assuming foo and bar are VCRs themselves.  </s>
<s> Yes, this is required for the baseline to capture the namespace of the configuration.  </s>
<s> baselined values?  </s>
<s> I'm planning on 'yes', otherwise these would be empty, filler collections -- not very useful.  </s>
<s> only those that were required to reach VCRs.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Though I've not figured out yet how the proposed property works when the VCR is a member of multiple baseline-controlled collections.  </s>
<s> It is an important property of baselines that they capture the namespace of the configuration, so collapsing the namespace this way into the 'disjoint sets' would be a Bad Thing.  </s>
<s> Two resources?  </s>
<s> Then I assume the two resources that you put under baseline control are 'vcr-a' and 'vcr-b', so the BC would look like this: /BCsb72/foo /BCs/b88/bar Tim  </s>
<s> Of course :-)  </s>
<s> Euh. Baselines capture a set of versions.  </s>
<s> Who said they capture the layout of the namespace in which the VCRs appear?  </s>
<s> Given my current understanding of baselines, I don't believe your statement necessarily follows.  </s>
<s> Oops.  </s>
<s> Reset.  </s>
<s> Somebody changed the definition on me in the past couple months :-) ... I just read the intro to the baseline section.  </s>
<s> "... and their names relative to the collection, ..." Sigh.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking: toss the property proposal, depend upon locate-history.  </s>
<s> Seeing the current definition of "baseline" ... I agree.  </s>
<s> Okay... so maybe I'll go write a FAQ entry -- non-versioned collections can appear in a BC as a way to reach the VCRs.  </s>
