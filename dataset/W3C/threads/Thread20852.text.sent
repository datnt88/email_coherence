Hi! 
I'm trying to use new Amaya 7.0 on W2K amaya-WinNT-7.0.exe 4631405 Bytes It displays error box on every start, however continues to work : (source: WIN_TtaSetToggleMenu (1) Error 1401 : ERROR_INVALID_MENU_HANDLE) [OK] -=AV=- amaya-WinNT-7.0.exe on W2K It silently exits (no any error messages) by selecting menu item : Special -- Preferences -- Browsing... -=AV=- On Wed, 4 Dec 2002 10:45:39 +0300 We cannot reproduce that bug. 
Could you try to des-install Amaya and check that no old version is still there. 
Then re-install the package 7.0. 
I hope it will solve your problem. 
Irene. 
Hi! It seems, there are problems in Windows Installer, it should check for previous versions of Amaya to upgrade to new version correctly. 
Yes, I removed Amaya 6.4 via Control Panel -- Add/Remove Programms before installation and completely removed C:\Program Files\Amaya\ folder by hand. 
Amaya 7.0 installation completed without problems. 
Still no success. 
It seems, some DLLs [in C:\WINNT ? 
] or Registry records from Amaya 6.4 conflicts with current Amaya 7.0 -=AV=-
