<s> I have been reading the specs on 1.0 working draft for XQuery regarding the where clause.  </s>
<s> It does not seem to support the following syntax: Let $a := input()/person/lastname Where $a = "miller" ?xml:namespace  </s>
<s> prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / Return $a  </s>
<s> Notice in the where clause there is no further navigation down the tree because this query wants all documents with lastname = to miller.  </s>
<s> All spec examples do not show this usage of the where clause.  </s>
<s> Is the above query syntactically correct based on the 1.0 standards?  </s>
<s> many thanks in advance Shane  </s>
<s> If you delete " ?xml:namespace  </s>
<s> prefix = o ns =  </s>
<s> "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / " and change the case of your keywords to lowercase, this parses fine according to our grammar:  </s>
<s> let $a := input()/person/lastname where $a = "miller" return $a It's often helpful to try out queries on our test grammar page if you're not sure whether a given query parses:  </s>
<s> Our BNF accepts this query just fine.  </s>
<s> You might be a little surprised by what it means!  </s>
<s> To explain why, let me add in a little data: let $in := people let $a := $in/person/lastname where $a = "miller" return $a What do you expect this to return?  </s>
<s> It returns the following: To explain why, let me step through this one clause at a time: let $a := $in/person/lastname $a is bound to: lastname robie /lastname , where $a = "miller" this is approximately equivalent to: where some $dot in $a satisfies $dot eq miller return $a since the where clause evaluates to true, this returns $a That's why for/where is more common than let/where, but let/where is very helpful with aggregate functions like sum(), count(), avg(), min(), and max().  </s>
<s> Is that helpful?  </s>

<s> Shane, I may be misunderstanding your question.  </s>
<s> Try the following query in the X-Hive online demo: for $b in document("/XQuery/docs/XMP/bib.xml")/bib/book where $b/publisher = "Addison-Wesley" return $b Paste the above query into XMP 1.1.9Q1  </s>
<s> Is that the usage of the where clause you are interested in (given the constraints on what can be queried in the online demo)?  </s>
<s> BTW general XQuery questions can be discussed at the mailing list on Andrew Watt  </s>
<s> Many thanks Mr Robie.  </s>
<s> The results you highlighted below are exactly what we were getting but not expecting.  </s>
<s> We changed the let to a for and all works great.  </s>
