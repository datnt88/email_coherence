<s> This kind of ISV activity is excellent and sorely needed in this working group.  </s>
<s> Hopefully the Working Group can get the input of accessibility aid vendors that do not have off-screen models to read information off the screen.  </s>
<s> Products such as voice-input, switch and scanning systems and learning disabled tools all need information about the document and the user interface it provides.  </s>
<s> These products cannot read information off the screen and must get the data programmatically.  </s>

<s> GG: DOM!  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this question shows a lack of knowledge of what Active Accessibility provides and unnecessarily limits the scope of the technology.  </s>
<s> If I was asked that question, and didn't know better, I'd have the same exact response!  </s>
<s> Active Accessibility is not just a screen based model, current versions expose the structure of HTML documents, not just what is present on the screen.  </s>
<s> Active Accessibility is not limited to HTML, like DOM is.  </s>
<s> It's a interface to interact with the user interface as a whole.  </s>
<s> Glen's response is different that what he's told me personally is separate discussions, but that's probably because of the limited scope of the question.  </s>
<s> Also, it's my position that if the vendor is willing to spend more time and special-case HTML, then more power to them!  </s>
<s> A native object model, be it DOM, Word's, Excel's, or Visio's is much richer than the generic interface provided by Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> Often times though, native object models are not designed with the needs of accessibility aid vendors.  </s>
<s> We improved Microsoft Office 2000's various object models to provide more information to accessibility aids.  </s>

<s> JRG 2. Would it be useful to for you to provide your own speech or Braille rendering using DOM with a synchronized visual highlighting of what you were rendering on the visual display?  </s>
<s> This would allow sighted colleagues to see where information is being spoken is coming from on the screen.  </s>
<s> GG: This would be an interesting thing to experiment with and offers promise.  </s>
<s> Several companies already do this with alternative input software and learning disabled products using Microsoft technologies.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> JRG 3. Do you see as one of the main weaknesses of the current DOM the lack of visual display positional rendering information?  </s>
<s> GG: Yes!  </s>
<s> This is not an issue with Active Accessibility and is also available in the Dynamic HTML object model.  </s>
<s> Hopefully the DOM WG will adopt it.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> JRG 4. Are there other features that would make DOM useful for your purposes?  </s>
<s> GG: None come immediately to mind.  </s>
<s> A feature that Glen's product doesn't currently need, but others might find  </s>
<s> useful is the ability to get a element based on a X/Y coordinate.  </s>

<s> Sure, many screen reader provide a "review" system to allow the user to freely move a cursor, sometimes the mouse pointer, over items that appear on the screen.  </s>
<s> The user can then request more information about the object.  </s>
<s> The accessibility aid uses the "element from point" feature to get a reference to the object at a particular location on the screen.  </s>
<s> Screen magnifiers and alternative input devices also use this feature.  </s>
<s> Mouse utilities also use this feature to "know" when to slow down over certain objects.  </s>
