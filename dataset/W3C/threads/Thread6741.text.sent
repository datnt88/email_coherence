Hi, Some comments on http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/ . 
It's great work in general, but there are some issues left. 
XHTML source: * to increase interoperability, it should use UTF-8 as character encoding. 
It's questionable whether the XML declaration should be included in the document, if the character encoding is UTF-8, since IE6 will only without switch to compliance mode. 
* The document RECOMMENDs usage of XHTML 1.0 Strict, the document itself declares it as XHTML 1.0 Strict. 
The good reason is...? * The style element includes comment delimiters. 
In XHTML this will cause, that the style sheet will be ignored, since comments get stripped. 
5.2 Translations First person pronouns ("I," "we") which are hard to translate SHOULD NOT be used. 
See [PRONOUNS]. 
Avoid "my" and "me" in examples (e.g., use "userResource" and not "myResource"). 
Specifications should not directly address the reader aswell. 
Translating second person singluar pronouns is a hard task if the language distinguishes between various forms (like formal and informal) of translations for "you", hence avoid using "you". 
9.1.2 
Document Identification Access privileges for documents in /TR/YYYY space are controlled by ACLs. 
ACL? 
I thought initialisms should be expanded on first occurence? 
;-) There are more instances of undefined initialisms/acronyms/abbreviations in this document, please take a look at it. 
9.5 References Markup for the example above: dl dt [HTML4] /dt dd cite a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/" HTML 4.01 Specification /a /cite , D. Raggett, A. Le Hors, and I. Jacobs, Editors. 
World Wide Web Consortium, 17 December 1997, revised 24 April 1998, revised 24 December 1999. 
This version of the HTML 4.01 Recommendation is http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424. 
The a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" latest version of HTML 4 /a is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/html4. 
/dd /dl This misses some anchor identifier. 
If references are links, some anchor is required. 
11.2 Spelling * Spell-checking using a US English dictionary is REQUIRED. 
Available tools? 
Mention ispell? 
11.5 Linking * Unless intentionally referring to the latest document in a series, always refer to specific W3C documents by using the "this version" URI. 
* URIs should not include a trailing ".html" or other extension because this is not part of the document identifier. 
... unless intentionally referring to a specific version of a document (e.g. a gif image where gif and png are available through content negotiation). 
* Omit trailing slashes from visible URIs but include them in href attributes and link elements. 
This saves the machine from having to make an extra round trip and the reader will be free of excessive punctuation. 
I don't like this one. 
If saving machine resources is a good thing, why should readers be educated to use the URI that doesn't? 
I think this is a disservice to the reader, /TR and /TR/ don't have to be the same thing, but W3C documents would imply otherwise. 
11.8 Markup * alt text describing the function of all images MUST be present and typo-free. 
Use alt="" for purely decorative images that do not add meaning to the page. 
No, not in the first place. 
If it is possible to write a text that replaces the image (read, alternate text), this should be done in favour to a description of the function of the image. 
* Use the longdesc attribute for important graphics and ASCII art, or explain them inline. 
The longdesc attribute can still be used to link to the inline explanatory text (if not inline == in some bitmap image). 
* Use the lang attribute for language change within a page. 
xml:lang * Links with the anchor text "Click here" MUST NOT be used. 
They make no sense on setups without mice or similar input devices. 
That's a rather bad reasoning. 
The main issue is that 'click here' is bad hypertext, you dunno where 'here' should be and the link provides no context information; especially it cannot be used without context, while the Style Guide for Online HyperText (IIRC) says they should. 
11.9 Large Documents Large single files that may be easy to print may not be easy to download. 
For large documents, you SHOULD: 1. Divide the document logically, storing chapters in separate files. 
Refer to compound documents. 
2. Offer an archived version (zip, tgz) of the separate files. 
3. Offer a single, printable version of the specification. 
This format may be compressed if too large. 
IMO, *all* technical reports SHOULD provide archived versions, especially if they are not made of only a single file (e.g., have images). 
Archived versions MUST provide all necessary files, especially they should include the relevant WD/CR/PR/REC/... style sheet and MUST NOT link images or style sheets not included in the archive. 
It might be quite common in North America to be connected 24/7 to the internet and thus offline reading just doesn't matter, but e.g. in Europe Internet connection fees are high and rated on a per-minute base, so offline reading is quite vital for many readers. 
Do them a favour and provide archived versions whenever possible and make them work (providing an archived copy is nice, but if the files link e.g. to the REC.css style sheet, users will encounter many difficulties). 
12. Confusing Terms W3C has reviewed its technical reports one by one since November 1999, for typographical errors. 
The following words appear repeatedly in those reviews and are easily confused. 
anti-alias hyphenate ASCII all caps Better US-ASCII if refering to the character encoding. 
US-ASCII is the preferred MIME name.

I will have to check into this. 
You mean Transitional. 
The 'bgcolor' attribute in the XML example needs transitional. 
I think using transitional is preferable to having a manual that won't validate as strict. 
Fixed. 
I quoted you. 
:-) Sorry, that's Access Control List. 
Fixed. 
To do. 
Fixed. 
Good catch. 
Done. 
Quoted you, thanks. 
For now, I left this as is, current W3C usage. 
Fixed. 
Quoted you. 
Would you explain that again? 
Sorry I don't quite understand. 
Fixed. 
Fixed (I hope). 
Fixed. 
Maybe it would help to know that this came up in reference to the ASCII standard and ASCII art rather than encoding. 
Thank you for your comments! 
Indeed... it seems unwise... Current in what way? 
I wasn't aware of this rule. 
Any idea where it came from? 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Hello, Dan, Yes. 
It won't do spec-prod much good as there is no public link to it. 
I will send it to you under separate cover to see what you think.
