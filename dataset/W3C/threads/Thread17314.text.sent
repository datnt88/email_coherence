Some time ago I implemented a couple of php subdomain detection tricks for quick testing of hex and rgb colour codes: typing ff0.milov.nl, 
cc6633.milov.nl, 
100,100,200.milov.nl, 
0,255,150.milov.nl 
(and so on) in your Address bar will fill the browser window with that particular colour. 
Now, couldn't this be expanded into a kind of hackable user stylesheet? 
Don't like the site colour, so add "orange." to the URL and it turns orange? 
(We'd have a bit of complexity with foreground colours, but it could be fun to try.) Joe Clark | joeclark@joeclark.org

Expect criticism if you top-post http://milov.nl/2544 
Interesting. 
But I can't see any advantages over current style switching techniques really. 
Am I missing something?
