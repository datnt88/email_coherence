Hi, When I set output-xml: yes why does the output include html , head , title and body tags when my original file doesn't include these tags? 
I'm using tidy as a last cleanup step after stripping those tags from an HTML file. 
The idea is to get my 'almost' XML' file cleaned up by tidy before presenting it to an XML parser. 
TIA, Pete

xml specs are more stringent than html 'specs'. 
In particular, there is less defaulting (or is it more proper to say no defaulting) of things like end tags, enclosures, etc. Larry W. Virden mailto:lvirden@cas.org

XML files are SGML files which use a special SGML declaration. 
In this declaration, you have the following code : FEATURES MINIMIZE DATATAG NO OMITTAG NO 
So you are not allowed to omit tags (and elements). 
Actually, in a SGML file, are many elements that you do not see, because of OMITTAG sttings. 
Anyway, they are present and when a parser builds a tree from your document, those things are there. 
In XML, all must be explicite. 
This is why in an XML DTD, you never see the - -, - O, O - that you can 
encounter in a more loose SGML DTD. 
Compare : SGML : (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd) XML (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/transitional.dtd) 
The two DTD describe the HTML transitional version 4 the two forms. 
You can notice that the use of cases and comments is more strict in the XML version. 
So, if you strip your XML file, I guess the will say it is not valid, even if it is well formed. 
Depends on what you intend to do.

It is, after all, called "HTML-TIDY." 
My guess is that the program assumes when you ask for XML that you want a *web page* in XML rather than a db for example; and most web browsers expect the html , head , title and body tags (and their closing equivalents), so it puts them in. 
I could be wrong, of course .

I'd use TIDY as my FIRST cleanup step.
