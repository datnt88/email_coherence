<s> Hi, When I set output-xml: yes why does the output include html , head , title and body tags when my original file doesn't include these tags?  </s>
<s> I'm using tidy as a last cleanup step after stripping those tags from an HTML file.  </s>
<s> The idea is to get my 'almost' XML' file cleaned up by tidy before presenting it to an XML parser.  </s>
<s> TIA, Pete  </s>
