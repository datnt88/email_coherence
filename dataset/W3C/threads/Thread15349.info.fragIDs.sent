<s> This draft uses more complicated language than the last, but I think it makes the intentions more clear.  </s>
<s> It's still a little rough, and I'd be happy to get feedback on both the substance and the language.  </s>

<s> We might not need to define a profile for every level, but I'd like to leave the option open.  </s>

<s> Since this document is intended for human, not machine reading, I'm not bothered by the self-reference.  </s>
<s> I'd like to hear what others think about this one in particular.  </s>
<s> I added the level 2 requirement that the author be able to specify the data to pass through to access tools.  </s>
<s> This would be things like specifying what letter to use for the shortcut, or which text to read out.  </s>

<s> For example, the technology supports device independent event handling and has a mechanism for specifying text equivalents.  </s>
<s> GV: I think in we need to limit the above statement to the same level as we are discussing.  </s>
<s> That is, "I have chosen a technology that allows me to meet Level 1 requirements" for level 1a statement.  </s>
<s> That is - It should say "allows the author/programmer to meet the other level 1 requirements of these guidelines."  </s>

<s> I don't think we should require this at level 1.  </s>
<s> If I make an obscure interface and publish the interface or an API for it on my website I would comply even though the interface was completely inaccessible.  </s>

<s> GV: e) I think this requires that the authors know what the Assistive Technologies are.  </s>
<s> Not really practical for most programmers I don't think.. 2) If the technology makes use of a user agent, the user agent [link to definition] meets UAAG at (insert level) GV: Doesn't this require that the author knows what user agent the person will be using?  </s>
<s> Often they will not.  </s>
<s> Perhaps if it said.  </s>
<s> At least one common user agent (or a user agent with a link on this page) exists that meets UAAG.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.3 at Level 2 if: 1) the technology or combination of technologies chosen allows the author/programmer to specify what data is to be passed through to the operating system accessibility interfaces GV: Many people won't know what this means.  </s>
<s> Yet it is required for level one conformance.  </s>
<s> 2) If the technology makes use of a user agent, the user agent [link to definition] meets UAAG at (insert level) GV: How will they know what user agent is being used?  </s>
<s> Oh, you mean technologies that only have one user agent?  </s>
<s> I guess we could use the following again.  </s>
<s> At least one common user agent (or a user agent with a link on this page) exists that meets UAAG.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.3 at Level 3 if: 1) If the technology makes use of a user agent, the user agent [link to definition] meets UAAG at (insert level) GV: I don't understand why the same things show up at multiple levels?  </s>

<s> just to clarify: We should promote accessibility even when the natural language of the site does not have adequate user agent support.  </s>
<s> assistive technologies do not support some language because there are no accessible sites in that language.  </s>
<s> It is a chicken and egg thing.  </s>
<s> As soon as there is enough pages (say all government pages), it becomes worth it for assistive technologies to provide support.  </s>
<s> Also you can translate a page and then use a screen reader -if it is accessible.  </s>
<s> Also you can get partial accessibility, such as enlargement of text ,but not full support such as speech...  </s>
<s> Besides whould this checkpoint make it against Australian legislation for a site to have content in some languages?  </s>
