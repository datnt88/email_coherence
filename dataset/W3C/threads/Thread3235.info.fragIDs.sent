<s> Just pottering around the website - I know Dave and Jan have started it thinking about this:  </s>
<s> I think the intention of this deliverable is ambigious: Month 5: (10.2: scalable_rdbms_mapping_report) Public report on mapping data from RDBMS.  </s>
<s> This will describe current best practice on using existing RDBMS or other storage systems for general Semantic Web data.  </s>
<s> (2 months, report, Pub.) 'mapping from' seems rather different to 'mapping to', i.e. you could have existing data in RDBMS and map it to RDF, or you could be storing general RDF in RDBMS.  </s>
<s> This deliverable seems to cover both.  </s>
<s> Do we think this is the case?  </s>
<s> I think it should :)  </s>
<s> cheers Libby  </s>
<s> That was (I think) the intention with this wording.  </s>

<s> I wrote it to be flexible and indeed wanted to and from them in the scope.  </s>
<s> Jan and I have started sketching notes in the draft area.  </s>
<s> It also can cover "other storage systems" that are not RDBMSes.  </s>
