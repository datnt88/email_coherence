We now have a first version of our test files ready for comment. 
They can be 
downloaded from: For a description of the test files, please read this document: We also have a tool, called the Access Tool Reviewer (ATR), that makes the use of the test files a bit easier. 
For more information on the ATR, please 
read this document: All these files, programs and documents are under development and intended to solicit comments and discussion. 
Please take a look and send your comments to the list.

Ooops. Make a small mistake in the previous message.

Chris and Josh, This is great! 
I've begun a preliminary review of SSB Technologies InSight 
(version 2.4 - couldn't download the latest - I'll have to talk with Tim again). 
The results that I have so far are at: In the quick 10 tests that I did, I found some interesting errors in InSight. 
I have a few questions/suggestions about the ATR tool and test files. 
1. If the tool being evaluated identifies the problem, but doesn't offer the suggestion, does it pass? 
For example, test file 1-1-1-f12 is a horizontal rule image without alt-text. 
InSight correctly identifies that it is missing alt-text but doesn't suggest "horizontal rule." 
The ATR tool 
says, "Should trigger: Image missing ALT text (suggest "horizontal rule"). 
I said that it passed it, since it did trigger. 
Perhaps these ought to be separate - the suggestion from the error detection. 
I think it would be good to know if the correct suggestion was made or if any suggestion was made. 
2. Several of the test files do not say what should trigger. 
e.g., 1-1-10-f1, 1-1-12-f1, 1-1-14-f1, 1-1-14-f2, 1-1-14-f3, 1-1-14-f4 1-1-10-f1.xml 
has a comment element while 1-1-1-f1.xml has a suggested_message and an empty comment element. 
3. During my review I made comments about additional messages that InSight 
was generating as I went along. 
Those comments are not recorded in the results. 
Also, the comment field did not clear when I selected a new test file (as I had expected it to do). 
To write something new I had to delete the text then write. 
BUT none of that was captured. 
Thanks for your work Chris and Josh! --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa 
Wendy, Thanks for the quick feedback. 
In answer to your questions:

rule"). 
I think that they have failed this test. 
But this test comes from the AERT section on "suggested repairs" so the test doesn't have the weight of some the other tests. 
You must mark the tests correctly then process the EARL to find out how the tool performed. 
For example, they may have passed only 50 tests but they were all P1 tests so the tool is excellent on P1 items. 
Sorry about that We're still working on the test files and should have this fixed up in the next couple of days.

Yes, comments are not getting stored in the output file. 
I'm not exactly sure how we should store them in EARL and am waiting to hear back from Sean. 
I hope to have this implemented very shortly (perhaps tomorrow). 
Cheers, Chris
