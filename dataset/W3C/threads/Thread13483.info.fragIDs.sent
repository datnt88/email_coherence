<s> Chris and Josh, This is great!  </s>
<s> I've begun a preliminary review of SSB Technologies InSight  </s>
<s> (version 2.4 - couldn't download the latest - I'll have to talk with Tim again).  </s>
<s> The results that I have so far are at: In the quick 10 tests that I did, I found some interesting errors in InSight.  </s>
<s> I have a few questions/suggestions about the ATR tool and test files.  </s>
<s> 1. If the tool being evaluated identifies the problem, but doesn't offer the suggestion, does it pass?  </s>
<s> For example, test file 1-1-1-f12 is a horizontal rule image without alt-text.  </s>
<s> InSight correctly identifies that it is missing alt-text but doesn't suggest "horizontal rule."  </s>
<s> The ATR tool  </s>
<s> says, "Should trigger: Image missing ALT text (suggest "horizontal rule").  </s>
<s> I said that it passed it, since it did trigger.  </s>
<s> Perhaps these ought to be separate - the suggestion from the error detection.  </s>
<s> I think it would be good to know if the correct suggestion was made or if any suggestion was made.  </s>
<s> 2. Several of the test files do not say what should trigger.  </s>
<s> e.g., 1-1-10-f1, 1-1-12-f1, 1-1-14-f1, 1-1-14-f2, 1-1-14-f3, 1-1-14-f4 1-1-10-f1.xml  </s>
<s> has a comment element while 1-1-1-f1.xml has a suggested_message and an empty comment element.  </s>
<s> 3. During my review I made comments about additional messages that InSight  </s>
<s> was generating as I went along.  </s>
<s> Those comments are not recorded in the results.  </s>
<s> Also, the comment field did not clear when I selected a new test file (as I had expected it to do).  </s>
<s> To write something new I had to delete the text then write.  </s>
<s> BUT none of that was captured.  </s>

<s> I think that they have failed this test.  </s>
<s> But this test comes from the AERT section on "suggested repairs" so the test doesn't have the weight of some the other tests.  </s>
<s> You must mark the tests correctly then process the EARL to find out how the tool performed.  </s>
<s> For example, they may have passed only 50 tests but they were all P1 tests so the tool is excellent on P1 items.  </s>
<s> Sorry about that We're still working on the test files and should have this fixed up in the next couple of days.  </s>

<s> Yes, comments are not getting stored in the output file.  </s>
<s> I'm not exactly sure how we should store them in EARL and am waiting to hear back from Sean.  </s>
<s> I hope to have this implemented very shortly (perhaps tomorrow).  </s>
