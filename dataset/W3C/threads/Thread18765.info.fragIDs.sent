One message from Murray Maloney followed by my comments. 
We will probably discuss that at the meeting Thursday, so your comments are welcome.

(by way of Mike Paciello paciello@ma.ultranet.com ) Subject: Dave/Dan: We would like to propose "D" Tag, use of FIG, IPP and PP at HTML meeting - thanks, Mike Hi, Here is a summary of my notes from the recent ICADD meeting... To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag with the REL attribute value set as "DESCRIPTION" The convention for the content of the A element could continue to be the text "D". 
However, when user agents are able to deal with A REL="DESCRIPTION , they might use a style sheet mechanism to hide the content of the element and substitute an icon, or language-specific text. 
In consideration of the potential need for multiple alternate versions of descriptive text, ICADD recommends the use of the FIG element to serve as a container for an image and attendant "descriptions" and "alt" text. 
For example: Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax. 
They are used to illustrate. 
I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification. 
To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag. 
The use of A in this case requires the use of standardized values for the REL and REV attributes, and a convention for the names of target anchors. 
We need conventions for pointing to a target anchor and asserting that it represents the beginning of an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page". 
There are two potential and complementary mechanisms available: - Use a naming conventions for identifying anchors, such as "IPP-[0-9]+", "IPP-[ivxlc]", "BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc. - Use REL="BPP" or REL="IPP" I assert that it would be helpful and reliably redundant to utilize both methods, and am recommending that. 
We need conventions for naming an anchor, which may serve as the target of a hypertext link, that asserts itself to be the represent the beginning of an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page".

Subject: "D" Tag, use of FIG, IPP and PP. Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 11:34:53 +0200 
To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag, 
I found a reference for the D tag is this the correct one ? 
What it says is: "A D-tag is a capital "D" text anchor that appears next to or below an image. 
This "D" links to a page with a full description of the image. 
Because D-tag descriptions appear on their own pages, they can be as long as an author wants them to be." 
My understanding is that the new cougar OBJECT tag will in fact serve the same purpose, and so I'm not in favor of doing anything with D tags at this point. 
For example: FIG IMG SRC="image.png" ALT="Picture of ICADD" A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ENGLISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="FRENCH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="SPANISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ITALIAN" HREF="...." D /A ALT LANG="ENGLISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="FRENCH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="SPANISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="ITALIAN" ... /ALT /FIG 
Unless I'm mistaken, FIG and ALT are not valid HTML elements at this point. 
Are you suggesting they get added ? 
Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax. 
They are used to illustrate. 
I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification. 
Langage can also be taken care of with HTTP Content-Language negociation. 
To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22, 
Is there a better reference to the semantics of these elements than: Basically, IPP and PP are for reference to printed page numbering. 
I think our team working on printing HTML/CSS should look at that. 
My reaction is that since we don't know how to print HTML well yet, it is too early to think about any mapping mechanism for accessibility purpose. 
Maybe I'm being blunt, but I have a hard time understanding how this whole IPP/BPP mechanism work. 
This is markup that appears in a source HTML and describe a post formating information ? 
How is that achievable ?

Two footnotes for this thread: Lloyd Rassmussen did a good job of introducing WebHeads to life with Braille in a note on the lynx-dev mailing list, archived at The "content" and "presentation" of braille documents are not so independent as in the visual-print realm. 
Braille is very 
physical; it must fit the fingertip. 
Disasters occur when a non-user tries to do something without checking with a user, as seen in the "monumental scale" braille in the new FDR memorial. 
A news article about this can be found at 
Al Gilman 
The above is not a true statement. 
What is true is that the presentation of Braille cannot always be directly derived from the visual presentation of the content. 
But to say that Braille formatting is in some way different from visual 
formatting in terms of separation of content from presentation is 
definitely incorrect. 
Yes-- Braille formatting needs to take into account the needs of the finger tip just as much as visual formatting takes care of the needs of the eye. 
But the above is just to acknowledge that Braille formatting is different from and distinct from visual formatting for the eye-- it does not assert that Braille formatting requires formatting specific knowledge to get tangled up in the information content.
