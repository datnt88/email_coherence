<s> (by way of Mike Paciello paciello@ma.ultranet.com ) Subject: Dave/Dan: We would like to propose "D" Tag, use of FIG, IPP and PP at HTML meeting - thanks, Mike Hi, Here is a summary of my notes from the recent ICADD meeting... To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag with the REL attribute value set as "DESCRIPTION" The convention for the content of the A element could continue to be the text "D".  </s>
<s> However, when user agents are able to deal with A REL="DESCRIPTION , they might use a style sheet mechanism to hide the content of the element and substitute an icon, or language-specific text.  </s>
<s> In consideration of the potential need for multiple alternate versions of descriptive text, ICADD recommends the use of the FIG element to serve as a container for an image and attendant "descriptions" and "alt" text.  </s>
<s> For example: Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax.  </s>
<s> They are used to illustrate.  </s>
<s> I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification.  </s>
<s> To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag.  </s>
<s> The use of A in this case requires the use of standardized values for the REL and REV attributes, and a convention for the names of target anchors.  </s>
<s> We need conventions for pointing to a target anchor and asserting that it represents the beginning of an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page".  </s>
<s> There are two potential and complementary mechanisms available: - Use a naming conventions for identifying anchors, such as "IPP-[0-9]+", "IPP-[ivxlc]", "BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc. - Use REL="BPP" or REL="IPP" I assert that it would be helpful and reliably redundant to utilize both methods, and am recommending that.  </s>

<s> Subject: "D" Tag, use of FIG, IPP and PP. Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 11:34:53 +0200  </s>
<s> To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag,  </s>
<s> I found a reference for the D tag is this the correct one ?  </s>
<s> What it says is: "A D-tag is a capital "D" text anchor that appears next to or below an image.  </s>
<s> This "D" links to a page with a full description of the image.  </s>
<s> Because D-tag descriptions appear on their own pages, they can be as long as an author wants them to be."  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the new cougar OBJECT tag will in fact serve the same purpose, and so I'm not in favor of doing anything with D tags at this point.  </s>
<s> For example: FIG IMG SRC="image.png" ALT="Picture of ICADD" A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ENGLISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="FRENCH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="SPANISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ITALIAN" HREF="...." D /A ALT LANG="ENGLISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="FRENCH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="SPANISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="ITALIAN" ... /ALT /FIG  </s>
<s> Unless I'm mistaken, FIG and ALT are not valid HTML elements at this point.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting they get added ?  </s>
<s> Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax.  </s>
<s> They are used to illustrate.  </s>
<s> I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification.  </s>
<s> Langage can also be taken care of with HTTP Content-Language negociation.  </s>
<s> To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22,  </s>
<s> Is there a better reference to the semantics of these elements than: Basically, IPP and PP are for reference to printed page numbering.  </s>
<s> I think our team working on printing HTML/CSS should look at that.  </s>
<s> My reaction is that since we don't know how to print HTML well yet, it is too early to think about any mapping mechanism for accessibility purpose.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm being blunt, but I have a hard time understanding how this whole IPP/BPP mechanism work.  </s>
<s> This is markup that appears in a source HTML and describe a post formating information ?  </s>
<s> How is that achievable ?  </s>

<s> Two footnotes for this thread: Lloyd Rassmussen did a good job of introducing WebHeads to life with Braille in a note on the lynx-dev mailing list, archived at The "content" and "presentation" of braille documents are not so independent as in the visual-print realm.  </s>
<s> Braille is very  </s>
<s> physical; it must fit the fingertip.  </s>
<s> Disasters occur when a non-user tries to do something without checking with a user, as seen in the "monumental scale" braille in the new FDR memorial.  </s>
<s> A news article about this can be found at  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> The above is not a true statement.  </s>
<s> What is true is that the presentation of Braille cannot always be directly derived from the visual presentation of the content.  </s>
<s> But to say that Braille formatting is in some way different from visual  </s>
<s> formatting in terms of separation of content from presentation is  </s>
<s> definitely incorrect.  </s>
<s> Yes-- Braille formatting needs to take into account the needs of the finger tip just as much as visual formatting takes care of the needs of the eye.  </s>
<s> But the above is just to acknowledge that Braille formatting is different from and distinct from visual formatting for the eye-- it does not assert that Braille formatting requires formatting specific knowledge to get tangled up in the information content.  </s>
