<s> From Chuck Opperman:  </s>
<s> "I have the following regularly scheduled meetings (Pacific Time) and would not be able: Mondays 10am - 1pm Tuesdays 11am - 1pm 2pm - 3pm Wednesday 9am - 10am Thursday 3pm - 4pm Friday 10am - 12noon However, I also have many meetings that get scheduled during the week that might prevent me from attending some occasionally.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that a 9am to 10am (PT) on Tuesday mornings might be best for me, and accommodate the many East Coast time zone folks as well."  </s>
<s> From Jan:  </s>
<s> "It's ok withh me but I could also go later (4-5pm or 5-6pm)." and on behalf of possible participants from Sausage in Australia anytime before 3pm EST would be the middle of the night.  </s>
<s> Are there any other requests, suggestions?  </s>
<s> Are later or earlier times prefered?  </s>
<s> Thanks Jutta  </s>
<s> I cannot make the following times (all given in Boston time): Tuesday 8 am - 1 pm Wednesday noon - 1 pm Thursday 8 am - noon Thursday 4 pm - 5 pm Friday 8 am - 10 am This means Chuck's suggested time of 9am - 10am (US Pacific Time) is not possible.  </s>
<s> My suggestion would be Monday afternoon.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, if we get commitments from people in both Europe and Australia or East Asia I would suggest that we have alternating times.  </s>
