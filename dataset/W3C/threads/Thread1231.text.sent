It looks like by chance I'm just barely in time for this last call. 
Some comments, none major showstoppers: Good to hear. 
I'm basically looking at this as "do the ones that are OK to handle as last call comments". 
Stuff that requires discussion or a new last call needs to wait for the next time around. 
- The first sentence on page 3 has some strange repetition: 'to allow charsets' in the first line; 'to be used as charsets' at the end. 
Fixed. 
- Section 2.5: 'A given CES is typically associated with a single CCS': For the UTF-8 example, this is definitely true (and helpful to be pointed out). 
For others CESs, I think it's wrong. 
The classical example is what I would call here the 'identity 8-bit CES', which is used in the whole ISO-8859-X series and many other cases. 
I'll change it from "typically" to "sometimes". 
- Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list. 
It is on my to-do list, but it isn't something I want to address in this registration procedure update. 
- 3.1 'constructed as a composition of a CCS and a CES...': CCS appears three times in singular. 
There are many charsets where a CES combines more than one CCS. 
Same problem again in the registration template. 
Good point. 
I'll make them plural. 
- 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646? 
What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/). 
What about them? 
The requirement is for a stable specification and nothing more. 
Updating the specification is OK as long as whatever rules that specification gives for updating are followed. 
(We have a detailed set of such rules for UTF-8, for example.) 
The primary point here is that we don't want a definition based on a pointer to a document which then vanishes, leaving us with a name and nothing else. - 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name. 
The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'. 
It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified. 
That's an issue for the registry, not for the present document. 
- 3.5 'ONLY if it adds significant value': I have heard from some people that this strict requirement has lead to some contraproductive effects, in particular things being used with x- prefixes for years. 
I think it would make sense to tone this down a bit. 
If you were talking about MIME types I might agree. 
But this is charsets, and we've seen no reluctance in this space to register everything under the sun. 
And perhaps more to the point, we had a lot of trouble reconciling the views of people who feel that charset registration should be restricted whenever possible and people who feel that registering everything that comes along is a good idea. 
This language is the carefully crafted result -- I don't think it would be appropriate for me to change it based on your say-so. 
In any case, if you feel this is worth pursuing I would suggest that you bring up specific examples of where this language has caused harm and see if a consensus can be reach to change it. 
- 3.6: The requirement of documenting the mapping to ISO 10646 where possible is great. 
It may be worth for the IETF to look at formats to do this in a machine-readable way. 
For an example, please have a look at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/. 
This is beyond the scope of this document. 
- Section 4.1: 'The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback on the definition of the charset and the name choosen for it over a two week period.': 
At the end of the sentence, the references are not exactly clear. 
The name choosen for the definition of the charset? 
The name choosen for a two week period? 
This can easily be improved, I guess. 
Fixed. 
- 4.2: 'Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf- charsets mailing within 14 days.': 
Within 14 days of the decision? 
That would be pretty easy; nobody can prove to the reviewer that he made a decision three months ago if he forgot to post it and claims that it took him three month to actually take the decision :-). 
Well, it is pretty obvious that the intent is two weeks after submission to the reviewer. 
But I'll clean up the language. 
- 5. The text about the 'Assigned Numbers' RFC reads hopelessly outdated in the age of the web, and rather strange given that the last such RFC was issued in 1994. 
This is outside the scope of this document. 
- 5. Given some recent explanations by Harald about how to coordinate charset registration and RFC publication, it seems to be a good idea to explain that roughly, so that further registrants don't start from the wrong end. 
This will have to wait for the next revision. 
- 6. 'A URL to a specification' - 'A URI to a specification'. 
Fixed. 
- [ISO-8859]: Lots of updates here, please see e.g. Fixed. 
- [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version! 
The ISO catalogue doesn't list it yet so I didn't update it. 
If I get a reference before publication I'll handle it as an author edit. 
Ned It looks like by chance I'm just barely in time for this last call. 
Some comments, none major showstoppers: Makes sense. 
But I don't agree on all points with your classification. 
- Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list. 
It seems to be the case that: - There is consensus (in the IETF sense) on the meaning of the above sentences. 
- It was shown that the interpretation of the above sentences may pose some problems. 
This seems to be a typical case for a last call correction. 
- 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646? 
What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/). 
Thanks for giving the interpretation of 'stable'. 
This is a reasonable interpretation, but there are others, and the doc should make clear what interpretation is intended. 
- 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name. 
The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'. 
It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified. 
Well, if it cannot be unified, it would at least be helpful to point out that there are differences, and which terms correspond to which. 
- [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version! 
Below is an excerpt from a mail from mike Ksar, convener of the WG responsible for ISO 10646: From: mike_ksar@hp.com 
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 Information technology -- Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS) -- Part 1: Architecture and Basic Multilingual Plane Regards, Martin. 
That may well be, but without substantive support from other quarters -- support I've seen no signs of -- I'm not going to accomodate your positions on these points. 
- Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list. 
I don't agree. 
This is a much bigger problem and the registry needs to be cleaned up before it gets addressed. 
(Work to clean up the registry is already underway, but I don't want to wait for it to finish before getting this update out.) - 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646? 
What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/). 
I'll see what I can do as a RFC editor note, but I note in passing that you seem to be the only one who was confused by this. - 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name. 
The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'. 
It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified. 
I'd much rather correct the problem than try to work around it. 
- [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version! 
I'll make the change as an RFC Editor note.
