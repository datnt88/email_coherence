<s> Hi all, we are a group of "geographers-turned-computer scientists" who are starting to get our heads around using OWL-S.  </s>
<s> Specifically we are planning to use OWL-S (Profiles) for service discovery (and later simple composition).  </s>
<s> We have first experimented a little with "pure" OWL(-DL).  </s>
<s> We have modelled concepts as classes and used a reasoner (RACER) to compute taxonomies between those concepts.  </s>
<s> The resulting taxonomy can be used for service discovery (e.g. return all sub- or superclasses of the requested input/output classes to the requester).  </s>
<s> OWL-S, however, models services as instances, which then refer through  </s>
<s> their IOPEs to OWL ontology classes.  </s>
<s> Our main questions in this context are: How can we use those instances in reasoning for service discovery?  </s>
<s> How does the service requester have to specify her request (class or instance)?  </s>
<s> What is the role of more specific service types that can be derived from the generic OWL-S service profile?  </s>
<s> (Is it possible, e.g. to specify a specific service type (as a class) and then retrieve all service descriptions (instances) that are instances of that class?) All this boild down to the question whether the service profile can be used for service discovery as a whole or whether only its parts (mainly IOPEs) are to be parsed from the description and then be used in separate reasoning processes (e.g. computing one taxonomy for inputs, one for outputs etc. - this seems to be what is proposed in [1], for example)?  </s>
<s> If the latter is the case, i.e. if OWL-S only serves as a "fancy XML template" (I'm playing the devil's advocate here) what use is the OWL-S "overhead" for service discovery?  </s>
<s> If you have any questions regarding mine, please don't hesitate to ask.  </s>
<s> Any help with this (or pointers if this has already been discussed elsewhere) are greatly appreciated.  </s>

<s> Hi all,  </s>
<s> as we did not get any responses to our first (lengthy) e-mail, here's another (much shorter) try.  </s>
<s> Reasoners like RACER are able to compute taxonomies between (OWL) concepts  </s>
<s> (ontology classes).  </s>
<s> As OWL-S itself is an ontology of services - how is it  </s>
<s> possible to reason about OWL-S service descriptions (which are instances in  </s>
<s> that ontology) in order to derive taxonomies of services?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Michael &amp; Arnd  </s>

<s> Sorry, lots going on.  </s>
<s> It's an ontology about services.  </s>
<s> Maybe of services if we consider the tripartite division of Atomic, Composite, and Simple, I suppose.  </s>
<s> What I meant is that we have no specific service types defined.  </s>
<s> In Processes as Classes (PAC), there was the thought that of any two services, you could derive whether one was more general than the other by computing their subsumption relation.  </s>
<s> However, it's not clear that that's useful or that it's even common that services defined as concepts in this matter *would* tend to have interesting subsumption relations.  </s>
<s> This suggests that there was no loss, at least ;) In Processes as Instances (PAI), there is, I think, the intuition that "Service type" and "Service definition" are somewhat separate.  </s>
<s> If you want a hierarchy of service types based on the definitons, you need to define some classes which have as members those definitions.  </s>
<s> We have to define some classes just to get some of expressivity we want (e.g., that a class has exactly 3 inputs), so there should be emerging some (uninteresting?) class hierarchies).  </s>
<s> You might be able to generate classes by looking at these definitions and thus recapture some of the PAC thought, but I'm not sure this is beneficial.  </s>
<s> Reasoners with ABox capability (like Racer and Pellet) offer a number of services for dealing with indiviudals (Pellet, for example, offers sound and complete (if slow and a bit limited) conjunctive Abox query).  </s>
<s> I think there is the thought (:)) with PAI that this sort of thing is more useful in the arbitrary case.  </s>
<s> For any particular purpose, you should define your own classes of processes and do instance checking (or retrieval, or realization) against the fully classified class tree.  </s>
<s> I don't know if this answers your question, but even if not, I hope it helps :) What kinds of problems do you want to solve with such taxonomies?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
