<s> Under Guideline 3.1, Level 3, Success Criterion #4: I think we missed a proposed rewrite to the first item uner the heading "Vocabulary."  </s>
<s> The The curent wording is as follows: *?Using vocabulary that is likely to be familiar to intended readers.  </s>
<s> : Using vocabulary that is common in the field or discipline to which the resource belongs (for example, integrative biology, marketing professionals, civil engineering, sales, human resource management) JS note (this note is not for inclusion in TR draft, just to explain change): Gregg had pointed out that phrases like "intended readers," "intended audience," etc., are not testable.  </s>
<s> The proposed rewrite above gets WCAG WG and accessibility evaluators out of the business of recovering authorial intention but allows them to acknowledge that some resources belong to highly specialized fields with their own specialized vocabularies; it doesn't require that all resources be written for the mythical "general audience."  </s>
