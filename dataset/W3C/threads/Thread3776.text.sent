v.w.o seems to need passive FTP. 
Could someone add this to the relevant Apache configuration files and restart (-HUP) the port 80 and 8001 instances? 
SetEnv FTP_PASSIVE 1 Recent CVS checklink and validator default to passive mode, but until they're updated, the setups are bitten by: ville@validator:~$ HEAD ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2506.txt

: I have done it on the port 80 instance, but I didn't mess up with the 8001 one (which seems to be run from Terje's account). 
(and that does fix the problem, see e.g. Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM Thanks!
