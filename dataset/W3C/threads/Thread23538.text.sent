Hi All A DOMDocument is just a container. 
So why is it derived from DOMNode? 
For invoking DOMNode functions we should get the DocumentElement from the Document and then invoke the functions we need. 
I am trying to implement the DOMDocument interface and I'm quite puzzled as to what should be the impl for getFirstChild, etc. Thanks in Advance Jaspreet DOMNode is also a container, with children, etc. getFirstChild would return the document element, or a processing instruction if any, etc. Have a look at section 1.1.1 regarding the possible children of a Document node, or appendix C.1.1 on how to map the Infoset to a Document node. 
Philippe Prompt replies make me so happy :) I tried returning the documentElement from getFirstChild but it didn't work.... What worked was returning the first child of the documentElement. 
Is this right? 
Thanks a lot Jaspreet I would recommend reading a tutorial on DOM. 
Almost any good introductory XML book should have one. 
There are also many on the web, see http://xmlfiles.com/dom/, http://www.xml.com/pub/rg/141, 
General question on usage should be directed to the users mailing list associated with your DOM implementation of choice, for example, xerces-j-users@xml.apache.org. 
If you implementing the DOM for a class assignment, you should investigate using the DOM Test Suite (http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test) to check your interpretation of the specification. 
If you are implementing the DOM and it is not for a class assignment, then you might want to reconsider since there are no shortage of existing implementations for common programming languages and platforms.
