Another charter item which isn't met yet, and with no progress in 5 years, is the ACL goals document. 
Attention went from goals to specification and never returned. 
The ACL specification may no longer be very much in line with the goals document any more (somebody would have to reread the goals document to see). 
It doesn't really matter because events left the goals document behind. 
The main reason for the goals document to be standardized would have been to enforce some process on getting ACL itself to RFC but that's done now anyway. 
So, to perform good housekeeping on our charter, does anybody object to simply removing this goal from the charter? 
Again, feedback and discussion within 2 weeks would be appreciated. 
Thanks!
