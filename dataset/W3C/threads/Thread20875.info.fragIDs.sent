<s> I don't know amaya details but I do know that once unix source bundles compile and build with gcc and related open tools, then it is fairly easy to port that source to all systems for which gcc and the other build tools are available.  </s>
<s> One exception is the used libraries.  </s>
<s> For tools like amaya, most notably the windowing libraries.  </s>
<s> On unix, this is the X11 set and on top of that sometimes sets like motif and such.  </s>
<s> Those libraries are hard to port to M$Windows but most of them are somehow ported or such, at least somehow available.  </s>
<s> For example the nirvana editor (www.nedit.org).  </s>
<s> That uses the motif librariy.  </s>
<s> It is also available for M$Windows machines, it 'just' needs a motif library.  </s>
<s> With the same route, I think it must be possible to get Amayas unix source and build that on M$Windows.  </s>
<s> But then again, why would hou? the M$Windows source is also available.  </s>
<s> if you have a compiler and such, you might be able to build it yourself.  </s>

<s> I just installed 8.1b in my W95 laptop and it worked like a charm.  </s>
<s> No messages, no nothing.  </s>
<s> The only difference might have been that I selected D:\amaya as the target directory instead of the default.  </s>
<s> It replaced a 7.2 Amaya that was there.  </s>
<s> The ISSET_SE.DLL was not mentioned, nor it appears in my disks.  </s>
<s> The version I used is amaya-WinXP-8.1b.exe which is not intended for W95.  </s>
<s> I didn't try the other one.  </s>
