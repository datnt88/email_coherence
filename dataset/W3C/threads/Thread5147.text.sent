Hello, sorry if it's in the draft but I didn't see anything about this : what about printing at a given scale ? 
Either specified in svg source file, or chose at print time by the user ? 
I guess it may be very interesting at least for mapping usages, Greetings, Robert Rivi?re French Ministery of Transports RRegf Hello, RRegf sorry if it's in the draft but I didn't see anything about this : RRegf what about printing at a given scale ? 
Either specified in svg source file, RRegf or chose at print time by the user ? 
This can be done already by specifying the width and height of the image, and also providing a viewBox that sets up the map-coordinates to physical-coordinates relationship. 
RRegf I guess it may be very interesting at least for mapping usages, Another thing that is useful in that context is the SVG mapping metadata: RRegf French Ministery of Transports Any publicly accessible use of SVG there that you could point me to? 
Its always good to see real-world examples, especially from industry and government.

But on the subject of printing, I think that's not enough to manage rendering scale : you also need to have complete control on or information about physical aspects of the support, e.g. at least a way to map your drawing units to paper units. 
You may answer that it's not SVG's responsability to take care of this, but from an user point of view, I think there is a need for this. 
I'd be delighted to give you this kind of thing, but unfortunately there isn't yet. 
From what I'm aware of, there are two projets under developpement running here : - one is about an intranet application for managing highways maintenance - the other is about distributing public information about traffic conditions, like this : on Java applet). 
But this one isn't going on very quickly... Bye, Robert
