<s> We have several times found that Amaya strips the charset declaration,  </s>
<s> ie. in our case, from an XHTML file during either editing or saving.  </s>
<s> This is bad enough normally, but we are posting files now without the  </s>
<s> XML declaration to ensure that IE works in standards mode.  </s>
<s> That leaves the file without any internal encoding information.  </s>
<s> Please rectify this as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Also, please check whether Amaya takes any other such decisions on  </s>
<s> behalf of the user.  </s>
<s> In my opinion the default should be to leave the  </s>
<s> file untouched.  </s>
<s> If any cleaning is done it should be an option and the user should be asked whether it is appropriate.  </s>

<s> date: 2002/06/27 Amaya no longer generates a meta http-equiv ...  element when it saves a XHTML document (and removes this element if it exists) to avoid  </s>
<s> conflicts between the charset in the XML declaration and the meta charset.  </s>
<s> When you request to save the document in HTML (See Save As), Amaya adds the meta.  </s>
<s> So the charset is either defined by the XML declaration or the meta element.  </s>

<s> Irene, Thanks for this explanation, but it still doesn't allow me to save XHTML Transitional pages in a way that will allow standards-mode on IE.  </s>
<s> This means that I cannot use Amaya for any of the web pages I currently  </s>
<s> develop.  </s>
<s> (I imagine that would apply to a lot of other people too.) If there happens to be a conflict between the xml declaration and the  </s>
<s> charset declaration, I would like Amaya to inform me when I save, and  </s>
<s> offer me the chance to change it, rather than take (in this case  </s>

<s> Okay I restore the old code and now the CVS version of Amaya generates the meta element with an http-equiv for each saved XHTML document.  </s>

<s> Then I'm unfortunately going to have a problem again if I edit and save my docs with Amaya.  </s>
<s> I put together an example.  </s>
<s> See the enclosed xhtml file (without xml declaration).  </s>
<s> The graphic withoutXMLDecl.gif shows how this will look in IE6 and, for example, Amaya, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.3 and Opera 7. If I edited this slightly with Amaya and it added an XML declaration, it would continue to look the same for all browsers, except IE 6 - the graphic withXMLDecl.gif shows how it now looks in IE.  </s>
<s> I am now authoring new pages in Standards Mode.  </s>
<s> With the XML declaration, IE is now in Quirks mode because the DOCTYPE wasn't the first thing in the file.  </s>
<s> If this were some small new browser I wouldn't care, but since IE has such a huge market share, this is going to affect (and break) the look of my page for the majority of my readers.  </s>
<s> That's why I don't want Amaya to add the declaration without my permission.  </s>

<s> Hello Richard, Irene, I think it is okay to leave out the xml declaration if the file is UTF-8 (as I think we have done for some time (but not currently) on the W3C homepage) is okay.  </s>
<s> The same applies for UTF-16 (with a proper BOM).  </s>
<s> However, I think it is a bad idea to not use an XML declaration for files in other encodings.  </s>
<s> As I think you are working mostly in UTF-8, I hope this should be okay.  </s>

<s> If I understand, your suggestion is to remove the xml declaration and to add a doctype + meta element.  </s>
<s> This is an HTML document, isn't it?  </s>
<s> As I explained before, Amaya is able to generate and edit HTML documents.  </s>
<s> In your case I suggest you generate HTML documents instead of XHTML documents (we can also add the HTML option in the New menu).  </s>
<s> The xml declaration is there not only to define the charset.  </s>
<s> It also allows browsers able to read xml documents to use an xml parser instead of an html parser and so to check that the document is well formed.  </s>
<s> What HTML guys think about that?  </s>
