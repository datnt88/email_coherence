Section 4.3.2 of the data model document does not appear to reflect the decisions of the working group in relation to mixed content: specifically, that the type of an element declared as having mixed content should be the string value, as an instance of xdt:untypedAtomic. 
The correct rules are stated in section 4.1.6. 
It is not clear why 4.3.2 
attempts to restate the same rules in a different way. 
In fact, the overall structure of section 4, which presents the same accessor functions organized first by function and then by the kind of node that they apply to, seems designed to lead to inconsistencies of this kind.

That's a good point. 
I'm content to call this editorial and address it by reducing the per-node-kind accessor sections to a simple list of cross references back to the appropriate section in 4.1.x.

These sections have been extensively redrafted. 
I believe the 12 Nov spec is clearer.
