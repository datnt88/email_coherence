<s> 1) It's not quite the same content.  </s>
<s> The "index" page *is* different when framed versus non-framed.  </s>
<s> The non-framed index page - http://www.cpsc.gov/indexnof.html - adds a "Spotlight" link, which points to the same page as the first frame of the original frameset.  </s>
<s> The first frame - the left-hand frame, for sighted users - is not a "navigation" page; it's a list of recalled products which, while important, isn't necessary for navigation or use of the site itself.  </s>
<s> 2) They might not have to maintain multiple copies of content.  </s>
<s> It depends on how they generate their pages.  </s>
<s> I can find nothing in the source of the pages to indicate that they're not using techniques which allow them to make updates in one place.  </s>
