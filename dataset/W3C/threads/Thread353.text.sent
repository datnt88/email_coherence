I've had problems with Tidy and XHTML. 
Tidy seems to get things very wrong with XHTML framesets. 
Tags like frame ... / are rejected. 
The final "/ " seems to make Tidy upset. 
Tidy itself however produces such frame tags, with "/ ", but when fed the code back for a recheck, it rejects its own code. 
Also the XHTML attribute "xml:lang" is unknown to Tidy. 
Many thanks for your feedback. 
I have altered FindTag() in tags.c to deal with this, moving the test for XmlTags to before the dictionary lookup. 
I have also updated the way xml is formatted to suppress line breaks after start tags and before end tags for elements with mixed content. 
I have to make a new release with these fixes soon.

Wonderful! 
I use Tidy a lot to check my XHTML pages. 
Now I'll be able to use it for my (very few) frameset pages too. 
I look forward to the new release. 
Thanks!
