<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> Adding support for DOM effectively turns a browser into an editor.  </s>
<s> This is often beneficial, but in memory-constrained enviroments it is often impossible.  </s>
<s> By making this Priority 1, a whole segment of UAs will fail conformance and might therefore pay less attention to the Guidelines in general.  </s>
<s> I suggest changing it to Priority 2 and limit the requirement fo the read (i.e. not write) portions of the DOM.  </s>
<s> I suggest changing all sections in Guidline 5 to reflect this.  </s>

<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> It depends on why you say that UAs should implement the DOM.  </s>
<s> Since I think that you could use the DOM to implement 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5, which are all Priority 1, it would seem to follow that at least some parts of the DOM should be Priority 1.  </s>
<s> If the UA is a readonly tool, then obviously read-write parts of the DOM are inapplicable, but could be used for "writing" parts of a document to, e.g., a screen-reader.  </s>
<s> However, if you don't see the DOM as being a way to implement other guidelines, but as something else entirely, then the priority should depend on what use cases you have for using the DOM at all.  </s>
