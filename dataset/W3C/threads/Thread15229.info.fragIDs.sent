<s> As discussed in the call today, we are planning to post a public working  </s>
<s> draft of the HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0 to the Technical Reports page.  </s>
<s> This is a draft, only a draft, and there are lots of incomplete areas.  </s>
<s> Still, if there are issues that you believe need to be addressed before we post it publicly, please send them to the list by the end of the day Friday, October 31.  </s>
<s> Please identify that the issue needs to be addressed before going to TR, or we will assume the comment is a general one that can be addressed after this working draft is posted.  </s>
<s> The current draft is available at Michael -- Signature -- Michael Cooper Accessibility Product Manager, Watchfire 1 Hines Rd, Kanata, ON K2K 3C7, Canada michaelc@watchfire.com Watchfire's spam filter often mistakes legitimate email for spam.  </s>

<s> Just my two eurocents: Uncategorized techniques - Use of the title attribute - Meta redirect - Meta refresh Why the two meta (redirect and refresh) aren't inside the metadata group?  </s>
<s> In the draft you refer to metadata for the HTML 4.01 Meta element[1] in the "Resource" section that contain also the meta http-equiv values for redirect and refresh.  </s>

<s> I moved the meta redirect and refresh outside of the metadata group because, although they involve the meta element, they aren't metadata, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> They are an HTML mechanism for simulating part of the HTTP response header.  </s>
<s> In a future draft I would like to find a better home for these than "uncategorized".  </s>
<s> These techniques overlap with techniques I expect will be in the Server-Side, or HTTP, or whatever we call it, Techniques document.  </s>
<s> We'll have to find a way to express that, and also to indicate when you would follow the HTML vs. the HTTP technique.  </s>
<s> There was a thread recently that raised that issue, and there seems to be a lot of preference for using the HTTP technique, though there are specific reasons people use the HTML technique.  </s>
<s> Anyway we'll have to speak to that.  </s>
<s> There are other techniques involving the meta element that are in the metadata section.  </s>
<s> These are about keywords, description, etc. and in my opinion belong there as they provide true metadata.  </s>
<s> It's messy semantics that the same element has such distinct uses, but there are historical reasons for this (pre W3C) and we're stuck with it.  </s>
