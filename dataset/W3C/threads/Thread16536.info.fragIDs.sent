<s> I am developing accessibility standards for my company.  </s>
<s> We do government sub contracting and a lot of government sites use Front Page for design.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> need to explore accessibility solutions (or have definitive reasons why it  </s>
<s> can't be done)for this product.  </s>
<s> Are there ways of designing accessibly with Front Page?  </s>
<s> Is it possible to fix a page designed on Front Page?  </s>
<s> Are there any resources addressing this issue?  </s>
<s> (Personally I would never use this product, but I need to deal with a lot  </s>
<s> of Front Page sites and Front Page users.)  </s>

<s> [DJW:] I'm pretty sure that if you know how to write HTML you can write good HTML in Front Page.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the user interface encourages bad habits, and  </s>
<s> it seems that it is fairly easy to generate invalid HTML as well.  </s>
<s> Early versions generate a document type that only permits HTML 2.0, which will need fixing for most pages!  </s>
<s> The sorts of ways that it encourages problems are by making presentational features easy to use, by putting them on the tool bar, but hiding the proper structural ones; I think that is consistent with the target WYSISWYG market.  </s>
<s> Obviously it also encourages the use of canned formats, automation etc.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] Dave Raggett's Tidy program was designed to try to create valid HTML from it.  </s>
<s> Accessibility requires human intervention though.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] There's actually an accessibility thread running on the lynx-dev mailing list in which two different sites (I think Ohio State is the problem one and a newspaper the good one) are producing pages with a Front Page meta tag (possibly hand retouched) and one is virtually unnavigable text only, whereas the other is no problem.  </s>
<s> The fundamental problem is almost certainly that the people who like using Front Page don't like to think about information (as against specified browser graphic) design.  </s>

<s> One of the ways you can 'fix' pages created by FrontPage is to modify the template used to create all your new pages, and add the DOCTYPE to the template.  </s>
