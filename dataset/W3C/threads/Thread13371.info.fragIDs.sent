<s> Having studied the relevant parts of http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226/ these are my thoughts 0.0 Where possible sites should be transparent in meaning without the use of text.  </s>

<s> 1.0 Provide text equivalents for text.  </s>
<s> ensure that the minimum text is used that conveys the meaning, with links to details.  </s>
<s> ~50% have a vocabulary of 2k words.  </s>
<s> 1.01 Provide data in site titles (meta tabs) as to number of words used and readability (flesch reading ease).  </s>
<s> 1.1  </s>
<s> Provide a means in the common browsers for:  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Is such data likely to be useful?  </s>
<s> I for one have no idea what a certain number in the Flesch scale means.  </s>
<s> We are going to have a problem with this one anyway though.  </s>
<s> I can just imagine webmasters saying, "if we provide data on how easy our web pages are to read, people will think that they're aimed at those speaking English as a second language, and therefore not read them."  </s>
<s> Maybe it would be better to put it in a new kind of tag (like the ALT tag does at present), and let the browser display it?  </s>
<s> Eg.  </s>
<s> That way, different browsers can decide how best to display it (and you can always hack out an HTML filter if you want to use any browser), and people who don't need the information don't get it.  </s>
<s> If it's possible to crawl the whole site (as Mike Vorburger did with one of his ALTifier programs) then the word count / reading level information can probably be generated automatically.  </s>
<s> (Not so with filters though because they only process the page you're looking at.)  </s>
<s> I thought that ALT tags do not get displayed when images are turned on.  </s>
<s> However, I can add an option to my access gateway to remove ALT tags if that's what you really want.  </s>
<s> (Or if there's anything else you can think of that a filter can do, within reason)  </s>
<s> Can you elaborate?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you mean.  </s>

<s> It's under Options and it's disabled by default; if you're using it then make sure you also disable the sight-related options as obviously the two interests conflict.  </s>

<s> Yes, there is some history embedded in the name.  </s>
<s> One of the key advantages of the Web when it was new was the hyper-linking feature that would take you straight to a new starting place anywhere in the world.  </s>
<s> This hyper-linking was first implemented with text, so it is commonly known as HyperText.  </s>
<s> It is called a markup language because it uses SGML-style tags to provide content and metadata interwoven in a single text stream.  </s>
<s> Letting one class of content be the default can increase efficiency.  </s>
<s> W3C is now developing Scalable Vector Graphics where the default will be vector drawing instructions, not text, and text will be the inserts.  </s>
<s> In fact, the format W3C has developed for multimedia, SMIL, basically has plugin media players as the default kind of content.  </s>
<s> Web documents can have these formats as their mother document.  </s>
<s> So it has indeed grown beyond Hyper- "Text."  </s>

<s> In the current draft User Agent guidelines it says the user should be able to turn off animated or blinking text.  </s>
