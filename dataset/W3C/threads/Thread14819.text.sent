Dear GL Listmembers, As part of the New Year we are trying to follow the W3C process guidelines for our group more closely. 
One of the components is the maintaining of a list of active members of the working group that are in good standing. 
Generally the working group is made up of a small group of people who meet consistently and regularly. 
Such members are expected to attend most all of the working group sessions. 
Members who do not attend at least 2/3 of the meetings are usually not considered in good standing. 
In our work we have many who cannot meet this standard for active membership but who do still contribute on the list or periodically. 
They don't fit the W3C definition of active members in good standing but we want you all to know that we value your/their contributions very much and find them an integral part of our work. 
For those interested in the list of the current active members in good standing you will find it posted on our GL website at To this group -- thanks for all your time and dedication. 
The workgroups are well named. 
It is a lot of work and we appreciate your particular dedication to the group. 
To the rest of our unofficial extended working group and contributors, keep up the good work. 
Thanks Gregg Vanderheiden Jason White WCAG Co Chairs Some of us (e.g. the unemployed) have difficulties making weekly lengthy long-distance calls. 
Perhaps we need to reconsider our method of meeting.

Forthcoming: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours I was disappointed in this too. 
I recently joined and have faithfully attended all but one of the meetings since joining. 
I read all the emails and try to add any input. 
I guess you are automatically placed on "bad" list until?? Eugenia Oh, one more question -- why is the W3C Process referenced, but not was followed with regards to members in "bad standing"?

Forthcoming: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours The W3C Process document defines participants in good standing: wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa Please excuse my ignorance. 
I realize I'm new to the group and some of you have been here from the beginning. 
But, please correct me if I err here on the side of caution. 
The fact of whether someone is on the list is not important. 
What is important each of us are adding in a way that helps the world be a better place. 
If we continue to allow designers whose total elevation of Internet savviness comes from having learned a programming language somewhere and has no concept of what the front end does to people that want to access the Internet we are back where we were and light years behind again. 
I was under the assumption that this group's goal was to make the Internet a better place. 
I didn't realize this was a political venue where I'm better because I've attended more meetings. 
I assured the leadership that I would not be able to travel to foreign countries and may not even be able to travel to a meeting. 
I do, however, intend on providing input when possible to perhaps provide a different view or a view that may not have been considered. 
I feel confident that I will be able to help in some small way. 
Again, please excuse my ignorance. 
If I'm on the "not so good list", but am allowed to participate that is fine with me. 
My suggestion to the situation is to have a list of people that are considered Associate Members and a list of people called Full Members. 
The Associate Members could still have their name on "the list" on the web site since that seems to be the goal of some individuals. 
Yet, the Associate Members could be ones that were not able to make meetings due to work conflicts or funding issues for small shops and unemployment for those that still want to participate. 
If I get removed because of this view, I accept that. 
It is not my intention to offend in any manner.

Here's a quote from that: "When a participant risks losing good standing, the Chair and Team contact must discuss the matter with the participant and the participant's Advisory Committee representative before declaring the participant in bad standing."

Forthcoming: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours I agree guys. 
I'd love to join some of the groups, but am unable to attend the meetings, so I've held off because I don't want to be in bad standing. 
We should think of a way to redo our meetings. 
BTW, I'm new to this group. 
I'm also in the CSS group and the HTML group. 
I'm just learning things about accessibility.

Perhaps we need to identify which large communities have no representation in w3c. 
Remarkably few non-profits, third world members, how about executive directors ie from other industries?. Blue chip industry sectors seem to have a predominance, where are aol and redhat? 
Is it fair to say that for the present, w3c can lay no claim to representing the interests of the wider world web. 
thanks j.chetwynd@btinternet.com Speaking for myself. 
My goal isn't to have my name on a "list". 
But at the same time I don't want to be placed on a "bad" list because of some unknown reason. 
At this point in time I feel that I have met the requirements for the short period of time I have been part of the group. 
And I fully intend to continue to do so. 
That's why I joined the group. 
To contribute, to learn, to encourage. 
To be placed on a "bad" list makes me feel that I'm not doing my part. 
If I'm not, tell me what to do to fulfill my obligation. 
Please excuse my ignorance. 
I realize I'm new to the group and some of you have been here from the beginning.

Regards, Lee Roberts Rose Rock Design Building web sites accessible by EVERYONE I think it's not just the name on the list that's all that important, but it is important to recognize that many of us are volunteering our time (and our expenses) to participate, too. 
Those of us who are active -- and I'm not saying I am or am not, only questioning how the rules are applied -- should at least receive recognition. 
I'm more concerned that the W3C procedures don't seem to be followed except in part. 
This leads me to some confusion at to how exactly the working group is being run, and whether or not that will be a barrier to getting more and/or more-interested people involved. 
Please keep in mind that the question of "who is on the list" was not raised by anyone wanting to be on a list, but rather by the working group chairs publishing -- for whatever reason -- a list of "members in good standing." 
--Kynn PS: I currently have an action item pending, and I was planning to take time out of my writing schedule this week and get it off my plate. 
However, as I am not a member of this working group, according to the official record, I am not sure why I should take the time to do so. 
No, I am not here purely for the public recognition, but on the other hand, if I'm told I am not "in good standing" -- then why am I spending any time on this?

Forthcoming: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours I am a disabled user who must utilize special accessories to operate my PC. My reason for joining The Group was to learn about and possibly contribute toward the formation of useful guidelines regarding accessibility issues on the Web. 
I guess that I'm not in good standing because I have not attended any online meetings, face-to-face sessions or meetings. 
Hopefully, I be able to attend in the future. 
I am not a Web scholar or designer, but I did submit a webpage for Web Validation last year located at: and somehow duplicated itself and definitely not up to your standards. 
Nonetheless, I enjoyed building it. 
And, despite the fact that now (as opposed to those 1986 photos) I am severely crippled, and wheelchairbound, I am still able to "soar like an eagle" just about anywhere on the WWW. 
So, thank you Active Participants for helping me understand some of the complicated steps involved in making the Web more accessible for all of us. 
With Great Appreciation, Gwendolyn I intend too. 
Currently I am mobile most Fridays. 
Also, I have yet to arrange a budget phone plan, because I am ringing the USA from Australia in peak time at my own expense. 
I hope to be available in the coming weeks.
