Draft Response To "Do No Harm" Member Request for An Additional Conformance Level That Would Address ONLY The Accessibility of the Content Created by the Tool NOTE: This response is a work-in-progress and does not reflect a consensus on the part of the Authoring Tools Working Group. 
This response is divided into 6 parts: Part 1: Introduction Part 2: Response Part 3: Conclusion Part 4: References Part 5: Drafter's End Note Part 6: Appendix: Member A's Comments in Full INTRODUCTION The Authoring Tools Working Group (AUWG) has been asked by a W3C Member Organization to consider adding a conformance level lower than Single-A, which would signify that the product "does no harm" [reference 1] RESPONSE It is the decision of the AUWG to reject this proposal for the following reasons: 1. 
The AUWG's charter [reference 2] expressly states that the "mission" of the Working Group is to: * provide author support for creating accessible Web documents; * ensure an accessible user interface for authors with disabilities. 
A conformance level that addresses only the output of an authoring tool, and ignores the accessibility of the tool itself, would, therefore, violate the AUWG's charter. 
Furthermore, it is the consensus of the AUWG that this request has been made in the improper forum. 
The proper forum in which the member organization should have raised this issue was the AUWG's charter review, and not during Proposed Recommendation. 
2. The AUWG has consistently, and repeatedly, reiterated its commitment to the fulfillment of the goals outlined in the ATAG's Abstract: This specification provides guidelines for Web authoring tool developers. 
Its purpose is two-fold: to assist developers in designing authoring tools that generate accessible Web content and to assist developers in creating an accessible authoring interface. 
Authoring tool users ("authors") can be enabled, encouraged and assisted to create accessible Web content through prompts, alerts, checking and repair functions, help files and automated tools. 
It is equally important that all people can be the authors of Web content, rather than merely recipients. 
The tools used to create this information must therefore be accessible themselves. 
Adoption of these guidelines will contribute to the proliferation of Web content that can be read by a broader range of readers and in authoring tools that can be used by a broader range of authors. 
[reference 3] And in the ATAG's Introduction: The guidelines in this specification are designed to help authoring tool developers design authoring tools that can be used by people regardless of disability, and that produce accessible Web content. 
[reference 4] As the above excerpts eloquently illustrate, it is the consensus of the AUWG that the web must not be reduced to a read-only experience for users with disabilities. 
The provision of a lowered conformance level, which addresses only the accessibility of the output generated by the tool, would, therefore, undermine the integrity and import of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, and is unacceptable to the AUWG. 
It is not sufficient that users with disabilities merely be recipients of accessible content--they, too, must be given the ability to make their individual and collective voices heard. 
CONCLUSION Therefore, it is the consensus of the AUWG that one cannot possibly "do no harm" without addressing the accessibility of the tool itself. 
Failure to do so would not only violate the Working Group's charter, but -- more significantly -- exclude a significant minority of users from expressing themselves online in an independent manner.

Appendix: MEMBER A's COMMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY We encourage the working group to focus on producing guidelines and/or techniques that will be more immediately intelligible and usable for practicing programmers, even at the expense of potentially creating difficulties within the W3C process. 
Particular areas of concern that have been identified are: 1. lack of clarity about what the guidelines expect to be done by the tool, versus what they expect to be done by the user of the tool; [CMN notes there has been discussion in a Member-only mailing list suggesting that the working group should formally identify which WCAG checkpoints must be dealt with by the tool and which can be ignored] 2. lack of clarity about the expected level of sophistication of the user of the tool; and 3. a document structure that allows considerable confusion about how many checkpoints there are. 
We suggest that the working group consider the possibility of a lower conformance level, indicating effectively that the product "does no harm" -- that it may not yet reach A level for supporting accessibility, but neither does it impair or interfere with efforts to provide accessibility. 
Such a conformance level could do a lot to help eliminate the problem of tools that do interfere with accessible markup.

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC I do not feel that having a conformance level available which allows a tool to get some kind of endorsement without meeting our aims is automaticaly a violation of our charter. 
However I think Gregory has raised an important point or two. 
The first is that in his opinion, a tool that excludes a number of users is doing harm, and should not be declared worthy of some kind of endorsement. 
Although I agree with the conclusion, I think it reflects a larger point, which is that there is not, (and is unliekly in my opinion to be) agreement in the working group on what is the single most important checkpoint - the answer always depends on who is asking the question, and in what context. 
For some people, a text editor such as emacs provides all they need to author HTML successfully, and their only requirement is that it be accessible itself. 
For others they don't really care if a tool is accessible, but they need to know what is required to make accessible pages, and help is the most important thing, since thay can repair anything a tool does, or rewrite it in the case of a programmable tool (this is what I did for over a year. 
For others again, the important thing is that the tool doesn't destroy their markup. 
I don't think there is any way we can stop (or any reason we would try to stop) people saying they meet some portion of P1 checkpoints and some portion of P2 checkpoints even if they do not meet a particular level. 
I think that is valuable information for consumers who are looking to match a tool to their needs, and it is therefore in our interests that it is possible to deal with such partial solutions in the absence of a good solution. 
I don't think hte propoosed solution will solve any problems, and I think it will sdetrack the group into dealing with questions of implementation plans that are more properly handled by the developers of an individual tool. 
So I agree with Gregory that we should not make this proposed change, and as I understand it that was the opinion expressed generally in the meeting where we discussed it last week. 
However I think the proposed answer addresses one aspect of the reasoning by which we rejected it at the expense of more generalised reasoning which I think we should have in our final response.

i do feel strongly that quote having a conformance level available which allows a tool to get some kind of endorsement without meeting our aims is automatically a violation of our charter. 
unquote it all falls under the heading appropriate use, and what use a particular developer makes of ATAG is up to that developer... only when they slap a conformance claim on their web site or on their boxes can we take action, although what form that action might take, i know not...

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC Are we approaching consensus on something like the following?: 
The working group has considered the suggestion. 
We reject it on the following grounds: 1. Determining finer grained priority levels is unliekly to achieve consensus. 
In particular, although there is consensus in the Working group that the current set of Priority one checkpoints are an acceptable set, ther is strong disagreement over which should be implemented first. 
In fact in existing authoring tools there are different implementation approaches. 
In particular, there is a strong sentiment that the first priority should instead be "make the tool accessible to people with disabilities", and some suggestion that it should be "promote accessibility in documentation". 
Attempting to resolve these differences seems unlikely to make any progress, although it will necessarily delay the release of the Guidelines as a recommendation. 
2. Providing an endorsement for such a trivial level of accesibility, which is simple for some developers to achieve while it requires others to rework their entire application structure seems counter to the goals of having actually accessible tools available. 
3. Determining the order in which to approach checkpoints is really an implementation-level decision which itis inappropriate for the Working Group to make, since it involves many factors that are relevant to an individual development project rather than to end user needs, which are the determinants of priority in the specification.
