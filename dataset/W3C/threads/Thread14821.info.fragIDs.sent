<s> Live captioning is delayed for a number of reasons -- including allowing people to read and correct the captions before transmission.  </s>
<s> That delay is unavoidable today.  </s>
<s> Yet that delay would  </s>

<s> Also, when doing training, you want the captions to lead any important visual event.  </s>
<s> That is, you don?t want the person reading the caption when they should be looking at the screen to see something critical.  </s>
<s> So having a time gap criterion may yield either an impossible goal or a  </s>

<s> Larry Goldberg or Geoff Freed would have the answer though.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there is a standard for Pre-captioned and another for Live-captioned.  </s>

<s> It would be entirely possible to say nothing on the point in the guidelines and leave it to techniques, or to say that the media equivalents (namely captions and auditory descriptions) must be reasonably synchronized with the non-text content, then leave it to the techniques to explain what is reasonable under various circumstances.  </s>
<s> On the other hand if there are clear requirements for synchronization that can be readily formulated and are of general application, then they could readily be included in the guidelines themselves.  </s>
<s> Yep - and that is done.  </s>

<s> Chas, there are many use cases where the captions aren't the same length as the content, or where it is desirable to pause the rest of the presentation - this is also the case in audio-described content, where it takes extra time to put in the audio descriptions.  </s>
<s> SMIL 2 was designed to handle these cases better in various ways.  </s>
<s> For example, it is possible to have audio descriptions (for example) which, if they are played, force the presentation to wait at key points (this is related to the way that it controls synchronisation failure, but also to some more purpose-designed functions it introduces).  </s>
<s> Of course there are other cases where this is not desirable.  </s>
<s> Enabling a user to choose between slowing the overall presentation, and keeping it running in real time, is a nice choice to have when people are getting a live transmission.  </s>
<s> The technology exists (not just in SMIL, but also with conventional TV) for making this choice at multiple points, and going from one mode to the other by various means (fast-forward through buffered content, or just jump to current real-time point, or ...) cheers Charles McCN Why do captioned objects need to be the same length as uncaptioned objects?  </s>
