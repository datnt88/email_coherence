<s> Hi folks, I am trying to post EARL to the annotea server http://earl.w3.org  </s>
<s> It has been modified to require certain EARL properties to be present before it accepts an annotation.  </s>
<s> However it is not clear to me where it requires these - I have tried including them in an external annotation body and in the annotation head (with the context, etc) to no avail.  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me what should be in the body if I was going to use an  </s>
<s> inline body.  </s>
<s> I note that in the discussion of this [1] Nadia figured out  </s>
<s> something about what was going to be needed, and the output for MUTUAT [2] seems to have the rights kinds of things Anyone got any clues?  </s>
<s> Prize is tools that post EARL and retrieve it... Chaals [1] http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-08-01.html [2] http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/MUTAT/  </s>
<s> The key is that you're not posting annotations anymore.  </s>
<s> You're just posting earl data.  </s>
<s> So you don't need to put your EARL in the annotations framework before posting.  </s>
<s> The form submission bit has yet to take out all the annotation-specific parts; if I remember correctly, you should use the form that allows you to just post plain RDF and formulate your own EARL-specific algae queries and not use the pre-made fields for querying.  </s>
<s> Nadia  </s>
<s> Yep, thanks.  </s>
<s> I might see if I can get a built-in that makes the server do what we would like and returns EARL stuff regarding what we are after (otherwise I have to URI-encode things which will be annoying ;-) Chaals  </s>
