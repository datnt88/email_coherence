Hi folks, I am trying to post EARL to the annotea server http://earl.w3.org 
It has been modified to require certain EARL properties to be present before it accepts an annotation. 
However it is not clear to me where it requires these - I have tried including them in an external annotation body and in the annotation head (with the context, etc) to no avail. 
It is not clear to me what should be in the body if I was going to use an 
inline body. 
I note that in the discussion of this [1] Nadia figured out 
something about what was going to be needed, and the output for MUTUAT [2] seems to have the rights kinds of things Anyone got any clues? 
Prize is tools that post EARL and retrieve it... Chaals [1] http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-08-01.html [2] http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/MUTAT/ 
The key is that you're not posting annotations anymore. 
You're just posting earl data. 
So you don't need to put your EARL in the annotations framework before posting. 
The form submission bit has yet to take out all the annotation-specific parts; if I remember correctly, you should use the form that allows you to just post plain RDF and formulate your own EARL-specific algae queries and not use the pre-made fields for querying.

Yep, thanks. 
I might see if I can get a built-in that makes the server do what we would like and returns EARL stuff regarding what we are after (otherwise I have to URI-encode things which will be annoying ;-) Chaals
