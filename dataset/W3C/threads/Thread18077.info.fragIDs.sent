<s> Charles, The group is committed to moving the document ahead with the best information it has for now.  </s>
<s> All outstanding issues were resolved last week and the group is preparing for the next stage of moving the document to recommendation status.  </s>
<s> I think that any further refinement of the document for features for people with cognitive disabilities will need to wait until the next draft, unless of course, their are comments from external reviewers on this topic during the upcoming stages to recommendation status.  </s>
<s> Any information though you are able to gather would be very useful for the current techniques document.  </s>
