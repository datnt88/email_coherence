<s> Hello everyone, We'll be having a qa-dev IRC meeting next tuesday.  </s>
<s> Notes from last time are at: Ville told me that (even though in general mail worked best for him) the only possible times would be 18-24 EET, that is 17-23CET if I'm not mistaken.  </s>
<s> I guess that may also be best for the night folks among us.  </s>
<s> Would it thus be possible to hold a quick poll for tuesday's meeting?  </s>
<s> Please send me a mail stating your preference: - 14:00 CET (15:00 EET, 08:00 Boston/Montreal) - 17:00 CET (18:00 EET, 11:00 Boston/Montreal) thanks olivier  </s>
<s> Given the few answers I got, The following seems like a good schedule to try at least once.  </s>
<s> irc://freenode#validator tuesday, Feb. 3rd 17:00 CET (18:00 EET, 11:00 Boston/Montreal) for two hours (or till I fall asleep) Agenda ideas: - recent progress /work  </s>
<s> - Bjoern's CSS schema  </s>
<s> - validators' test suites agenda additions welcome if you think that won't be enough.  </s>

<s> Notes from 2003-02-03 IRC meeting.  </s>
<s> Attendees : Bjoern, Nick, Yves, Ville, Karl, olivier + lurkers (Regrets: Terje) Agenda: - CSS schema and parser - Checklink - Test suite/harness for validator(s) Action items after this meeting: AI (cont): Bjoern - write a specification for css schema AI (cont): Bjoern - contact libcroco maintainers AI (cont): Nick - investigate Apache2+modperl, play with :8001; AI (cont): olivier - review and integrate submitted error messages AI (new): Nick - demo test harness  </s>
<s> AI (new): Ville - send edited changelog for checklink  </s>
<s> AI (new): olivier - organize release cycle for checklink - CSS schema and parser Bjoern showed and explained his draft[1] (ideas and issues) of CSS schema. the basic idea is to have a language that helps writing tools for css and a new css validator.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.websitedev.de/css/schema/draft/  </s>
<s> The group then discussed available CSS parsers to work from (or lack thereof).  </s>
<s> Ideal would be a C (CPP) engine, other languages Ok as well.  </s>
<s> Existing products: SAC implementations are mostly vapourware, W3C CSS validator needs to be (partly) rewritten, libcroco the best-available approximation.  </s>
<s> Bjoern has a (continued) AI to contact libcroco developers and will proceed with that, and will work on his draft, show it to www-style at the end of february.  </s>
<s> - Checklink Currently Link Checker (checklink) tied to the Markup Validator (check) but the two have very different development process and speed.  </s>
<s> No specific reason for them to be tied (though nothing prevents against adding some integration glue somewhere if that is desired).  </s>
<s> Decision: We will work on a beta test and standalone release, as well as packaging of checklink ASAP.  </s>
<s> Ville will send a list/summary of changes from code in stable validator, olivier will prepare beta announcement from it.  </s>
<s> Future work: tearing apart / modularizing.  </s>
<s> Easier now that it should  </s>
<s> not go in the way of markup validator's release pace.  </s>
<s> - Test suite/harness Currently we have a basic list[2] of links as "test suite" for markup validator.  </s>
<s> Not sufficient, nor very flexible.  </s>
<s> [2]http://validator.w3.org/dev/tests/  </s>
<s> What would be much better: (semi?) automated test system, a solid repository of test cases with description/expected result, and an easy (i.e not bugzilla-heavy) process to submit test cases (e.g with bug reports).  </s>
<s> Not only for markup validator, checklink.  </s>
<s> Olivier has been playing with the current tests and Log validator[3], but that does not address all necessary features, e.g test the validators ui, escaping html, uris, showing proper dialogs, etc. [3] http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/10/valtest/ Nick has ideas, will hack up a demo.  </s>
<s> Olivier will gather clear and full feature set and requirements.  </s>
<s> Next meeting : March 2nd, 2004, 17:00 CET (18:00 EET, 11:00 Boston/Montreal) olivier  </s>
<s> Ok, here goes a "NEWS"-like change log since the production version (full changelog available at - Improved redirect loop detection - Recursion scope checking fixes - Config option to disable checking documents on non-public IP addresses - new dependency on the Net::IP CPAN module - Markup improvements - Documentation improvements (command line options, embedded man page) - Various other small bug fixes  </s>
<s> I have started some initial work on this, implementing some per-document type (ie.  </s>
<s> MIME type) based handlers, akin to HTML::LinkExtor, using a factory pattern.  </s>
<s> Currently first cut implementations exist for generic XML documents (XML Base, XLink, XInclude) and CSS (using CSS::SAC which is currently broken for url(...) property values - only @import's work).  </s>
<s> Only the handlers are implemented currently, checklink does not even use them yet.  </s>
<s> Will continue that development and post betas for discussion after the next "production" checklink is out and modularization officially starts.  </s>
