LRK:: 
By the way, just to reveal a personal preferance, I prefer to watch non-English films with subtitles instead of films which dub into English to attempt a seamless presentation. 
It particularly annoys me to discover a film is dubbed without being told. 
LQ:: It seems like you're saying that Web pages presented in non-visual environments have been dubbed and that the natural medium for Web pages is visual. 
I'll assume that I'm misinterpreting your analogy. 
There is no dubbing required for presenting a Web page seamlessly in non-visual environments. 
The point of seamless accessibility is that the page adjusts naturally to all browsing environments. 
The non-English film dubbed into English is not seamless. 
Ideally, all movies would come on laserdisc, with optional subtitles for several languages that can be turned on by the user, and alternate versions available dubbed into a similar variety of languages. 
:) So the user can select whatever they want. 
That's how _I_ see the web working, with regard to seamless accessibility.

to follow up on what Kynn Bartlett said: 
The W3C agrees with you. 
I think that if you review the Proposed Recommendation for SMIL you will find it supports that scenario well. 
OBJECT in HTML 4 gives you an ordered fallback sequence but SWITCH in SMIL 1 gives you a range of choices. 
And a few presentation-wide logicals which mean you don't have to walk through all videos turning on captions, for example. 
Al 
with newer production and playback technology, selectable language subtitles looms just ahead. 
for the web, I can only hope for comfortable viewing and useability. 
no medium will ever be all things to all people.
