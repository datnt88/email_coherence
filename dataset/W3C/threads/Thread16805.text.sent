I have been trying out the map element as a way of organising sets of links into groups. 
What I have found is that the screen reader I am using reads out "start of map section navigation with 0 items" . 
- when there is a group of several links within the map tags. 
Does anyone use this, and can you write the code so that it will tell you how many links atre in the group, rather than saying "0" ? 
Does anyone know of sites that use the map element to group links? 
The html I was using is like this: A HREF="page1.htm" Topic 1 /A | A HREF="page2.htm" Topic 2 /A | A HREF="page3.htm" Topic 3 /A | A HREF="page4.htm" Topic 4 /A | Cheers all, I would say that your screen reader is trying to be extra smart, and has a bug in that. 
A map like you have described should be renderable directly. 
This is the new HTML 4 model (well, it was new 5 years ago) which adds block content (paragraphs, lists, text links, etc) to the things that can be in a map. 
In the old model the things in there were always invisible anyway, and they were all "area" elements. 
Check with the manufacturer of your screen reader. 
The relevant part of the HTML spec is Cheers Charles McCN I have been trying out the map element as a way of organising sets of links into groups.

MAP is required to have a name attribute, because it only makes sense in the context of a USEMAP. 
You also are in violatin of a *should* requirement on the A elements; the syntax of SGML doesn't really allow the DTD to enforce the requirement that A elements specify regions. 
Map is not a general means of grouping links, but specifically for image maps. 
A graphical browser, with images on, will not render it. 
HTML 4 introduced the concept of the map element as a general method for grouping links. 
This was reinforced in HTML 4.01 when it was changed to allow what already worked - text links and area elements being mixed (for backwards compatibility). 
You are correct about hte name attribute being required, although this probably would have changed if we had done an even better job. 
If the map element contains block content, and not just area elements, then it should be rendered by graphical browsers, and the only one I know of that didn't is amaya, where it is a registered bug that may have been fixed now.

(please provide not only name, but version number, as well - choose "Help" and then "About" to discern) the second question to be asked is: 2. did you change any of the screen reader's default settings? the third essential question is: 3. what browser are you using? 
(please provide not only name, but version number, as well - choose "Help" and then "About" to discern) using JAWS for Windows versions 3.x and 4.0 in conjunction with MSIE 5.5-SP1 or Lynx32 (version 2.8.4dev2), textual maps are handled without problem - could you please also try the following test pages, in which the MAP element is used to provide a navigation bar: (the markup of the last 2 passes the W3C validator) - and report what you hear? when the MAP element does not contain graphics, JFW does not identify the links contained within the MAP as "image map links" (when the user-configurable setting "Say Link Type" is selected, which is the default setting) as it does when it encounters an image map comprised of IMG elements - for more information on JFW's HTML Options, consult: gregory. 
Hi Gregory I'm using Home Page Reader 3.0, which works with IE 5. I have changed some of the defaults, but none to do with "map" as you don't get the option. 
I tried your first example page with my test page, ie when it gets to the map element it reads "start of map with 0 items" then reads the links, then "end of map".
