<s> There is a new version of the Guidelines Working Draft up on the GL website as before there is a table version and a linear version of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Table version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806.htm The linear version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806txt.htm  </s>
<s> This set has incorporated as many of the following as we could (compatibly) cover -comments on the lists  </s>
<s> -comments made at Peterborough -the results of coordination talks between the chairs of all the guidelines and tool groups We still have a few to work on but wanted to get this out to the list for use, study and comment.  </s>
<s> We will be using this document as a reference document from here forward.  </s>
<s> That is, we will begin logging changes that are made to make it easier to follow.  </s>
<s> So much has happened though that we haven't been able to do that in the past while.  </s>
<s> So give this one a thorough read and we'll reference discussions back to this one.  </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for all the input and hard work.  </s>

<s> The current issue list doesn't seem up-to-date with the recent thread on reorg of the sections, that's fine, but it would help if the date of "issues gathering" on the list was indicated.  </s>
<s> Hello, I think the guidelines are looking great.  </s>
<s> Here are a few comments.  </s>
<s> The ones marked [Editorial.]  </s>
<s> do not refer to the guidelines as such but rather the prose or organization of the final easier-to-read document.  </s>
<s> 0) [Editorial.]  </s>
<s> Some words should be defined, such as: a) "equivalent" (as in what makes two forms of information roughly equivalent) b) "modality" (B.1, Rationale) c) "collate" (A.4, Technique 3) d) "link phrases" (D.5) 1) Rating and Classification - Instead of "implementing" a guideline (presumably with one or more techniques), I suggest using a different expression, including "follow a guidline", "observe a guideline", "respect a guideline", or even "comply with a guideline".  </s>
<s> I like the latter, but realize that it's much stronger language that may scare off some readers.  </s>
<s> - In the paragraph following the priorities: "For Techniques, there may be a number of techniques..." This should be fixed.  </s>
<s> [Editoria.]  </s>
<s> I think that the differences between a guideline and a technique should be more clearly spelled out.  </s>
<s> - [Editorial.]  </s>
<s> In the introduction to the guidelines, a statement should be made that authors should keep in mind that some of their audience is required to override and ignore the intended layout and design of the page.  </s>
<s> Many of the guidelines (those for sense-independence and device-independence) are motivated by that fact.  </s>
<s> 2) Section A. - "Provide alternative representations of all non-text information so that a page may be perceived and used without needing to be seen and without needing to be heard."  </s>
<s> [Editorial.]  </s>
<s> Perhaps some explanation should be given about when alternative represenations are and aren't helpful.  </s>
<s> For instance: 1) Text is almost always useful as it may be read or spoken.  </s>
<s> However, even text may confuse a user when it is presented improperly by a UA.  </s>
<s> For instance, tabular text, spaces between words, or ascii art read by a screen reader may lead to confusion.  </s>
<s> 2) Sound is useful to describe visual information (images, video, scripts).  </s>
<s> However, sound must be complemented by text.  </s>
<s> 3) Images are useful, however (1) they must be complemented by text and possibly sound (2) some people may have difficulty seeing them in some contexts.  </s>
<s> ...and so on.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether saying something like this steals the thunder of the guidelines or whether it complements them by comparing the alternatives in one place.  </s>
<s> Maybe this could appear instead in a central reference document.  </s>
<s> - Guideline 5. "Use HTML in a way that allows you to provide alternative presentations easily."  </s>
<s> My first reaction to this was "This belongs in the techniques section."  </s>
<s> After a good night's sleep, I have changed my mind (for now!).  </s>
<s> Perhaps what struck me was the word "HTML" in the guideline.  </s>
<s> I think it's the only guideline to refer to HTML explicitly (although some refer to some HTML features).  </s>
<s> I propose removing HTML from the guideline and saying something like: "Design documents that readily lend themselves to alternative presentations." 3) Section B. - Guideline 2: "Use elements and attributes appropriately."  </s>
<s> Define appropriately (e.g., "as specified").  </s>
<s> 4) Section C. - Guideline 2. "Enable keyboard operation of all page elements."  </s>
<s> Why all?  </s>
<s> Does this mean active (links, controls) elements?  </s>
<s> Should be defined.  </s>
<s> - Guideline 3. "Provide interim solutions to facilitate operation ..." "Solutions" strikes me wrong here.  </s>
<s> Instead, I propose echoing the language of A.5 (minus the "HTML" part): "Design documents that are accessible to users with older browsers and assistive technologies."  </s>
<s> 5) Section D. - Guidelines D.1 and D.3 are similar.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a more abstract guideline would be: "Group document components into semantic units and clearly label those units."  </s>
<s> Under this guideline, techniques would refer to form controls, lists, and frames.  </s>
<s> I realize that frames may be an important enough subtopic to merit its own guideline.  </s>
<s> - Guideline 5. "Create link phrases that strike a balance between being an accurate description of the link, even when read out of context while at the same time, not being too long." Proposed: "Create link phrases that (1) do not repeat on a page and (2) are meaningful when read out of context and (3) are terse."  </s>
<s> Note: Since the technique for this guideline is the same as the guideline, perhaps the technique should be changed.  </s>
<s> For example, one technique might be to avoid phrases such as "Click here." 6) Section E. - I think E.1 should say more specifically : "Do not use elements or attributes unless they are defined in a W3C Recommendation (HTML 2.0, 3.2, or 4.0)."  </s>
<s> Note the addition of "W3C" and "Recommendation".  </s>
<s> - Proposed guideline: "Avoid deprecated features of a language."  </s>
<s> The HTML 4.0 spec says that authors should avoid deprecated features (as they are likely to be dropped in future versions and with the advent of new technologies).  </s>
<s> That's all for now! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
