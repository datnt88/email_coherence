Hit the reload button :) W3C Working Draft 12 November 2002 But great work Eric! 
Yeah, thanks all. 
Dave Well done everyone. 
Since we have so many working drafts, it makes sense to send out just one announcement for them all. 
If no one objects, I'll do that tomorrow. 
Brian This isn't an objection, but some thinking-out-loud. 
Asking everybody to review everything often results in getting nobody to review anything. 
It's clear to me that subscribers to www-rdf-logic will be interested in the model theory; they're perhaps more likely to pay attention to an announcement from PatH (though I hesitate to impose further on Pat). 
The syntax spec and test cases should go to the developer fora; www-rdf-interest at least, but probably other places too. 
I'd expect an announcement from DaveB to get the most attention. 
I'd like to see Mike Dean shop it around the DAML crowd too. 
I'd like to see the "customer groups", i.e. dublin core, RSS, etc. invited to review the primer. 
But I wonder... you can really only expect one thorough read of a document from any given reviewer. 
Do we want to play that card on this draft? 
Or do we expect the next one to be substantially different? 
EricM, thoughts? 
I have similar thoughts/reservations about concepts. 
So... hmm... maybe asking everybody to review everything is right for this round of drafts, supplemented by a few more targetted invitations here and there.
