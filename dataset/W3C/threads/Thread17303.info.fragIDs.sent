89% of 408 California municipal Web sites surveyed flunked Priority 1 (in automated testing). 
75 were manually tested, also with poor 
results, though the report goes into no detail at all on that point. 
(In fact, it's only mentioned on the blog.) And the actual report is, of course, in a PDF (tagged, with three minor access errors)-- -- which for some reason Google doesn't have an HTML version of. 
(Are they cutting down on that? 
Even PDFs I put up aren't converted.) Joe Clark | joeclark@joeclark.org

Expect criticism if you top-post 
Joe Clark said: 
I'm suprised that 11% passed. 
I build Web applications for public sector 
clients on a daily basis. 
In every Request for Proposal that we get, there are accessibility requirements, but they are never given any kind of priority when it comes to awarding the job. 
And, quite often, you can tell that the client really has no clue as to what accessibility is all about. 
I hear and read this phrase way too often: "Must be compliant with the ADA Section 508 Guidelines." 
The sad thing is, our salespeople refer to accessibility the same way. 
They are equally as clueless. 
The simple fact of the matter is that goverment agencies are required to mandate accessibility as a requirement, but they have little idea of what it is all about. 
This does not mean that everyone working for a government agency is clueless, because I know for a fact that the State of Connecticut put all of its Webmasters through accessibility training a few years ago. 
The point is that most people working in the real world working on Web sites simply don't care about accessibility -- because they don't need to. 
Quite a few know that, to some degree, it's an issue, but there is no mechanism, no driving force in place that actually makes them want to learn the intricacies and be compliant.

From Randal RUST: 
The problem is that there are many people in the "accessibility value chain", a term we use to describe the whole endeavor of accessibility, which includes AT manufacturers, mainstream technology engineers, salespeople, retail clerks, etc.: everyone involved in getting the product designed, delivered, and supported. 
Most of the people in this chain have important roles, (procurement officials, web design RFP writers, etc.), but do not have the spare cycles to absorb the entire world of accessibility. 
Instead of expecting them to become experts, we should lower our expectations. 
They should get only the training they need to do their jobs. 
But there is a trade-off: the ***organization as a whole*** must be made fully competent. 
That means that for each job category in the accessibility value chain, there must be clearly interlocking "policies and procedures" on accessibility, and the training that goes with them. 
Not at all by coincidence, our training program is customized: by industry or product category (web, telecom, computer hardware, etc.) by organization type (company, state agency, consumer advocacy group) by job responsibility (engineering, marketing, customer support, etc.) We find that this works well, once you get the organizational commitment. 
Basically, it creates a "bureaucratic model" (in the positive sense) instead of a dysfunctional "clone the expert" model of information dissemination. 
It's easier to get the commitment from the organization if you can show that the training and implementation will be economical and proportionate to the issue.
