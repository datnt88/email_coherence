<s> I agree that we must, at all costs, stay in synce with the WAI guidelines.  </s>
<s> I will not, however, refrain from complaining.  </s>
<s> ALT=" " is much closer to  </s>
<s> function (for spacer images) than ALT="spacer" which is, obviously, descriptive.  </s>
<s> I wish the debate over the validity of ALT=" " were archived someplace.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the final opionion on this matter was reached because the HTML specs disregard all leading and trailing white  </s>
<s> space.  </s>
<s> This means that ALT=" " should be treated as ALT="" and that a paradox is produced by having a string to produce the NULL value!  </s>
<s> ALT="" is used for LOTS more things than spacer images.  </s>
<s> One technique that I think is fairly common is to divide a large graphic into pieces so that it loads faster.  </s>
<s> ALT text is really only required for the first piece and ALT="" would be *prefered* for subsequent pieces of the same graphic.  </s>
<s> Check out http://www.apple.com/ for an example.  </s>
<s> The rule that you are trying to enforce is:  </s>
<s> Provide text equivalents for all images, including invisible or  </s>
<s> transparent images.  </s>
<s> If content developers cannot use style sheets and must use invisible or  </s>
<s> transparent images  </s>
<s> (e.g., with IMG) to lay out images on the page, they should specify  </s>
<s> alt="" for them.  </s>
<s> The prohibition against ALT=" " occurs ONLY as part of a depreciated example and it is NOT explained.  </s>
<s> We are NOT talking about writing an HTML  </s>
<s> validator.  </s>
<s> What is *OUR* (the WCAG) *REASON* for prohibiting ALT=" "?  </s>
<s> BOTH of deprecated examples at the *wrong* way to do things.  </s>
<s> ALT="spacer" is *NOT* suggested by the  </s>
<s> techniques document.  </s>
<s> Until we get an definitive answer to this, I propose the following: - ALT=" " is allowed.  </s>
<s> (No warning, nothing.  </s>
<s> Not untill we can say (with a clear reference) with authority WHY this is not allowed.  </s>
<s> - ALT="" is suspicious and, if found, the user is prompted with "ALT text for this image is NULL.  </s>
<s> This is acceptable only if this image is used solely for decorative purposes and is completely free of meaningfull content, for example, as a spacer image."  </s>
<s> ALT="" should NOT be allowed when the image is the only item in a link.  </s>
<s> For example: This would mean that our authoring tool would have to be dynamic enough to  </s>
<s> allow: but then generate an error condition if "go to foo" were deleted!  </s>
<s> This is tricky because the "easy out" is to never allow ALT="" -- which IS in conflict with the WCAG techniques document!  </s>
<s> Rules enforced by authoring agents CAN be more strict than the WCAG.  </s>
<s> This would alow us to include the ALT="" exclusion!  </s>
<s> I am all for dropping any references to the "TITLE" attribute.  </s>

<s> Provide text equivalents for all images, including invisible or  </s>
<s> The rule we should try to enforce is checkpoint 1.1, not something in the technique document, which is not a stable reference.  </s>
<s> Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element  </s>
<s> I disagree, you might have no need for ALT text other than "" even for an isolated image link.  </s>
<s> For instance, on www.whitehous.gov:  </s>
<s> (that's not what you actually get there, there's currently no ALT at all, but you would get something like that under lynx, with ALT and [] used to show link) [Head shot of the President &amp; Vice President] [The President &amp; Vice President]: Their accomplishments, their families, and how to send them electronic mail [Drawing of the America Eagle] [Interactive Citizens' Handbook]: Your guide to information about the Federal government [Stone statue of George Washington] [White House History and Tours]: Past Presidents and First Families, Art in the President's House and Tours -- Tour Information [Drawing of a book opened] [The Virtual Library]: Search our site, including an extensive archive of White House documents which is a little redundant, not to say annoying with ALT="", you get just the right information: [The President &amp; Vice President]: Their accomplishments, their families, and how to send them electronic mail [Interactive Citizens' Handbook]: Your guide to information about the Federal government [White House History and Tours]: Past Presidents and First Families, Art in the President's House and Tours -- Tour Information [The Virtual Library]: Search our site, including an extensive archive of White House documents In a sense, the wording: Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element fits my example, since in that case, the equivalent is "". since the description/function is already inline, next to the image, but not in the same A  </s>
<s> Daniel brings up the case where an adjacent image and text point to the same place.  </s>
<s> I agree it's redundant to have both links.  </s>
<s> However, even if you replace the ALT text with "", there's still a problem.  </s>
<s> The user will hear that there's a link there.  </s>
<s> For example, in Lynx with numbers on there will be a number.  </s>
<s> So they'll know it's a link, but hear that there's no ALT text.  </s>
<s> First of all, this adds a bit of clutter.  </s>
<s> Second of all, it will I think decrease user's confidence that it's accessible, hearing a link with no ALT text.  </s>
<s> In general, I think the better solution is to include the image and text within a single A /A pair.  </s>
<s> The white house page has a complication, however, since the image and text are in separate table cells, and this would require the link to start before a cell and end in the middle of the cell, which is illegal.  </s>
<s> A way around this is to put the image and text in the same cell with the image floated left.  </s>
<s> An example using the align=left attribute is shown at Of course, align=left is deprecated, but since the whole thing uses a table which is deprecated in favor of style sheets, that doesn't really matter.  </s>
<s> The best solution would use style all the way, except that not all browsers support style... but thats another story.  </s>

<s> On the other hand, the WAI will only undercut its effectiveness if we are sending different messages by the ER guideline-implementation guidance and  </s>

<s> They should be consistent and any  </s>

<s> On the whole, where it affects what should be in the resources as served, the GL group should still be regarded as having senior authority even for points where the WCAG requires some interpretation to be concrete.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I realy do not understand the idea behind: Not allowed - NULL ALT value (ALT="") Allowed - ALT value of 1 or more spaces (ALT=" ") Both from a semantic/logical point of view and HTML specification these are quite the same thing.  </s>
<s> My major reservation with this guideline is that there may be out there many people who took the effort to write accessible pages with alt="" where appropriate, and now we tell them to revise their pages, without any reason whatsoever.  </s>
<s> Regards, Nir Dagan "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein  </s>
<s> This depends on the UA.  </s>
<s> An smart UA could completely drop the ALT="" image link, after checking that the A href for the img is the same as some other very close textual A.  </s>
<s> Note that this technique of adjacent logo pointing to the same resource as an adjacent textual equivalent is common on the web, and often it uses two A, not one, for implementation reason (alignment, table layout, etc) that we can't easily ignore.  </s>
<s> The idea is that ALT=" " is appropriate for spacer images, while ALT="" is appropriate for "content free" images.  </s>
<s> Your point is well taken that from a semantic/logical point of view they are equivalent.  </s>
<s> I think this is the reason for any debate.  </s>
<s> Another reason for the distinction is the (perhaps incorrect) behavior of the most popular text-only browser.  </s>
<s> Lynx treats them differently.  </s>
<s> Missing ALT Lynx will treat as [LINK] or [IMAGE].  </s>
<s> ALT="" will hide images and links from Lynx.  </s>
<s> ALT=" " will be rendered as Lynx as [ ].  </s>
<s> ALT="" is really only an issue for links.  </s>
<s> There is agreement that ALT="" is often appropriate (and even prefered to some other choices).  </s>
<s> The current debate is the behavior of authoring agents.  </s>
<s> The authoring agents should NOT start with ALT="" since this would encourge bad content.  </s>
<s> The warnings that an authoring agent generates could be more strict than a HTML/WCAG validator.  </s>
<s> [good summary; may I offer the following tweaks:] The hiding of items with ALT="" is under user control; it can be switched off.  </s>
<s> Screen reader users require that their systems be able to pronounce punctuation, but a lot of the time they run with punctuation skipped.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the ability to suppress all mention of the most insignificant images is regarded as a benefit by many users.  </s>
<s> I agree that warnings can and should be issued without a strict violation of a WCAG checkpoint.  </s>
<s> On the terms of reference of "the current debate" I wonder if you have drawn such a fine line that you actually managed to miss the mark.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> believe that the document Chris is maintaining is supposed to serve as a  </s>
<s> common reference; both for tools which check existing HTML and for checking which is performed seamlessly as one creates new material in an authoring tool.  </s>
<s> Even that can be either by writing HTML text or by triggering generation of HTML text.  </s>
<s> In that sense, the debate is not about what the generator "starts with," but rather what the checks accept, IIRC.  </s>
<s> Chris, Daniel: can you clarify this?  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Not quite.  </s>
<s> You are ignoring the way logic depends on lexical analysis or the recognition of word boundaries.  </s>
<s> "Lay out" is a verb while "layout" is a noun.  </s>
<s> The logic depends on the lexing.  </s>
<s> Whitespace is not guaranteed to  </s>
<s> be logically without effect.  </s>
<s> Null is not whitespace, space is.  </s>
<s> There are enough situations where this introduces a semantic difference.  </s>
<s> In the HTML specification it merely warns that some user agents may ignore whitespace in certain circumstances.  </s>
<s> I do not believe that you will find this carried forward in either the work on XML normalisation nor in the Internet-Draft from DRUMS updating RFC 822.  </s>
<s> What I am saying is that the best thinking on this issue is that a null string and linear whitespace are  </s>
<s> logically different, a distinction that must be preserved.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I like the idea of a smart UA surpressing a picture link that's near and equal URL-wise to a text link, but couldn't it do that more generally, even if ALT is not "" ?  </s>
<s> User configurable of course.  </s>
<s> ACtually, this is a potential ER repair tool feature idea which, like all repair tool features, would have use in the user interface As for associating a specific behavior with ALT="", we could try to establish that convention, but I think it would be better to use Aural CSS, with the Speaking property set to "none".  </s>
<s> cf.  </s>
<s> Yes, it would take longer for this to come to pass, but it would take a long time to promote specific meaning for "" vs " " By the way, what about " " or Would they be semantically the same as " "  </s>

<s> What about the case where the meaning requires both elements?  </s>
<s> For example, a icon that means "mail to" followed by the words "Larry LarRue".  </s>
<s> Here we can't use ALT="" or " " because there's a function to the image.  </s>
<s> Here's the code with separate links: Its clearly better to put img and text within the same link: IMG ALT="Mail to:" src="mbox.gif"  </s>
<s> Larry LaRue I'll admit that this can get tricky if people are using tables to format their pages.  </s>
<s> There are ways to do it for some common cases, e.g. text below the image, in which case the whole link can fit inside a single table cell.  </s>
<s> There may be more complicated cases where you can't manage it.  </s>
<s> But at least we should recommend it where it is possible.  </s>
<s> And this will go away when style sheets become widely used.  </s>
<s> If we accept this as a general recommendation, then ALT="" or ALT=" " becomes a particular case.  </s>

<s> Chris came in with the additional requirements that we look at suggested checkpoint repair techniques during the authoring process (for A-prompt).  </s>
