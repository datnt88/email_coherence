<s> When I think of documents, I think of a single resource only, especially if we?re using the word resource to replace the present word ?page?.  </s>
<s> In my mind, 50 documents as per above would be 50 resources.  </s>
<s> Could a resource be considered large if it contained limited words (or none) and a huge file (a video clip, for example)?  </s>
<s> If URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a specific address for the location of a resource, isn?t the resource then the last ?thing? in the address string.  </s>
<s> For example: http://www.sesa.org/blah/blah2/blah3/etc.html where etc.html would be the resource or page.  </s>
<s> I see a series of documents being the same as a series of resources.  </s>
<s> My question is ? is a single resource the same as a single document?  </s>
<s> Is there any difference?  </s>
<s> By all means, I am really confused now.  </s>

<s> Like I said, this is by no means a make it or break it issue for me but an issue that I feel will be confusing to others.  </s>

<s> thank you for all of you hard work.  </s>
<s> I have a couple of reservations as well - more so on the 'readability' of the final WCAG document.  </s>
<s> By using terms such as 'single resource', 'multiple places in a resource' we risk alienating the developers and authors who are working on *only* web sites - they simply may not understand WCAG.  </s>
