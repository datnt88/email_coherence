<s> This could set up conditions where browser vendors claim HTML 4.0 support without supporting any of the implied style and script extensions.  </s>
<s> Another problem could arise where browser vendors implement vendor specific languages which would not support access to the DOM in a standard form.  </s>
<s> If a new specification (Unified Browser Language (UBL) for example) or a unified all consuming HTML specification were created to incorporate these existing and emerging standards, then a clearer direction could be given to browser vendors.  </s>
<s> The UBL could be broken down into various levels which would define browser capability very clearly.  </s>
<s> UBL 0 (Standard HTML, No Scripts, No Styles) UBL 1 (Style sheet extensions to HTML and style sheet interpreter) UBL 2 (Scripting extensions to HTML and complete script interpreter) Devices like WebTV, Windows CE Devices, Nokia 9000's etc. would probably support "UBL 0" or "UBL 0/1" for "presentation/publishing" only.  </s>
<s> More advanced devices might support "UBL 0/1/2" or "UBL 0/2" and so on for application purposes.  </s>
<s> A unified specification would also provide less leeway for vendors like Microsoft and Netscape because the various language interfaces would be fully described.  </s>
<s> Extensions to the UBL could then easily be presented and added with embedded HTML extension so that the base HTML spec would not have to go through as many revisions.  </s>
<s> I don't think XML will provide the kind of extension support required here.  </s>

<s> Your commercial web applications are ready!  </s>
<s> You will note from my original comment that I have suggested doing exactly what you are suggesting by providing levels/modules of the specification which add the required extensions to HTML for each module.  </s>
<s> I am in no way implying that a single spec should cover all aspects of the browser interface, merely that the base spec should be extensible by module and not contain superfluous extensions implemented at the discretion of the browser manufacturer's.  </s>
<s> If a browser maker support HTML 4.0 then they should support all of it.  </s>
