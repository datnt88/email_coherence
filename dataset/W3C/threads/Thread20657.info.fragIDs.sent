<s> I just noticed that Amaya doesn't work on an ftp site only http sites ... is the addition of ftp access or mailto anticipated or do they not fit the goals of Amaya...  </s>
<s> Unix philosophy normally says one tool for EACH job (efficiency) so user uses his own ftp / mail utilities but Windows tend to tie systems together (user friendliness)  </s>
<s> Wondering which philosophy is pursued here ?  </s>

<s> Received this message but can't answer ---  </s>
<s> Could someone on the development team answer the query ie what is the Amaya behavior and can it be made to call ShellExecute ??  </s>
<s> in Windows you have a: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ftp\shell\open registry key.  </s>
<s> It says what application the user wants to use to open FTP sites.  </s>
<s> I bet Netscape and other "I'm the 800 pound gorilla and you'll do what I say"-style applications ignore it and always use their builtin ftp client A properly designed Windows application, when it founds an unhandled file or protocol, or a user preference that overrides the standard behavior, should use the ShellExecute(Ex) function instead, which automatically determines what's the registered application, and launchs it.  </s>
<s> It's really easy to implement, since the function does all by itself.  </s>
<s> What's the current behavior of Amaya when it founds a ftp/gopher/telnet/mailto URL?  </s>

<s> Hi, We didn't propose the ftp support in standard because the is not tested enough, but it's available.  </s>
