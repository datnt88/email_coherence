Hello, I would appreciate if the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model defines whether a default null namespace is represented by a namespace node or not. 
Section 4.5 Namespaces says in 4.5.1 2 The namespace prefix may be the empty sequence. 
If the URI is the zero-length string, the prefix must be the empty sequence. 
Hmm, there might exist namespace nodes without prefix and without URI. 
Such a node would be created by an xmlns="". 
OTOH, I would interpret this as an undeclaration of the default namespace, thus it removes an existing namespace node (that would be present otherwise). 
The specification should unambiguously state, under which circumstances such namespace nodes come into live. 
I prefer not to introduce such "null" namespace nodes. 
There shouldn't be a difference between foo / and foo xmlns="" / One more question: Are situations imaginable that a namespace node doesn't have a parent? 
Since the specification thinks so I would like to see a comment just as for attribute nodes.

| I agree with you, I think the text is wrong. 
There should never be a namespace node whose string value (namespace URI) is zero-length, as namespace nodes always represent the declaration of a namespace and not the undeclaration. 
I think that it is now possible in XSLT to create a parentless namespace node: viz Though this probably isn't what was envisaged when the DM spec was written - at one time there was an idea that namespace nodes would be "shared" between elements in some way.
