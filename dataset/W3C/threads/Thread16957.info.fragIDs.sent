All, I have search the archives and can't seem to find anything on this although I'm sure that it's been covered somewhere. 
scenario: A page needs posting that is aimed at a minority section of the community. 
Let's say for the sake of argument that we need to post material aimed at the local Cantonese-speaking population. 
There is a problem in putting up 
the text of the page because Cantonese is not based on the Latin character set and reads in a different order to Indo-European languages. 
we could scan 
an image of the text and put that up (far from ideal) with alt text and longdesc but the textual equivalents would have to be in English too so that doesn't solve anything. 
Has anyone considered embedding a sound file in the page that will play on loading the page and 'speak' the text in the appropriate language? 
What potential problems might this cause?

Hi, I don't see where the problem is, except that you might not have the right authoring tools. 
There is in fact a lot of content in Cantonese. 
Putting 
pages on the Web in chinese or arabic or other character sets has been reasonably easy for a number of years now. 
But putting up an image of chinese 
text causes lots of problems, like any images of text. 
Embedding a sound file alongside text only causes two problems. 
One is the bandwidth required, and the other is whether people are able to play the file. 
The technique has been used by lots of sites for quite a long time now - for an example consider mencap - http://www.mencap.org.uk - whose audience often find any written language difficult or impossible to work with. 
I think the problem might be more acute in languages like Welsh, which worldwide have very few speakers - I don't know if there is a speech synthesiser that can handle welsh, so a person who is blind may have trouble getting comprehensible text to speech. 
But a little work with Yolngu Matha languages - a group of 31 languages that share a script and pronunciation, more or less, and have collectively only thousands of speakers - suggests that it probably is possible. 
A more complex problem exists for hebrew and arabic (one of these is a common language for australian government material to be translated into). 
In these languages it is common not to write the vowels in words. 
This apparently causes problems for screen readers, and more problems for people who are dyslexic in certain ways. 
This should considered when testing WCAG checkpoint 4.1 - write simply and clearly. 
A similar issue exists in Japanese over the use of Kanji or Kana characters, but it is a more complex issue that I won't treat here. 
Cheers Charles All, I have search the archives and can't seem to find anything on this although I'm sure that it's been covered somewhere.

For some values of "reasonably", yes. 
:-) I'm afraid it's still rather complicated to get started with authoring in such languages, especially in countries where such languages are minority languages so that the problems are not widely understood. 
A large part of pages in Arabic still uses images of scanned texts. 
(Some sites that might help in getting started with authoring in Chinese: Besides, browsers often have problems with displaying Chinese. 
On most modern browsers, it's basically a font problem, but possibly a big one. 
For example, if you use computers in a classroom or public library, you typically depend on what has been installed on them, and this might be rather restricted. 
When the user agent side of the matter is problematic, it would be best if the content were available in different alternative formats. 
For Chinese for example, this could mean an alternative presentation that uses Latinized transcription (pinyin). 
If digits (rather than diacritic marks) are used as tone markers, it could be written in ASCII, resulting in high accessibility in the technical sense. 
I have no idea what this would imply as regards to speech synthesis, i.e. whether there is speech generation software that takes pinyin as input.

Yes, getting into the nitty-gritty of internationalisation there are perhaps as many issues as there are in accessibility. 
In a public setting, what has been installed is of course important - it is easier to find terminals set up for chinese text in asia than in earl's court london. 
When I worked on this five years ago I was editing source code, which was fairly easy for me - there is text editing software available that handles all kinds of scripts. 
Talking to people who use a "minority language" in a place where it is a common language is helpful, but it is true that the choice of WYSIWYG tools for handling latin scripts is much broader than the choice for some other scripts. 
The www-international@w3.org mailing list - archived at a similar role to this list for issues of internationalisation. 
In addition, looking for information in english about how to edit Thai is a little like trying to do user tests with a screen reader as a casual user - people who use the technology or language every day will be able to use them better, on average.

Not a good example because Chinese is well supported by modern browsers. 
Although books and possibly newspapers may be written top to bottom within right to left, that's not a fixed rule and web pages are written in left to right within top to bottom order. 
If you want a difficult case use an Indian language. 
Whilst the BBC Hindi page is in UTF-8, I think you might need IE6 and Word 2000 (for the fonts) to cope with it. 
I'm not aware of Indian versions of Windows in the way that there are Thai and Chinese ones, although there may be local software, which probably violates character set labelling rules, that does support Indian languages in native form. 
(Google use romanised Hindi.) Chinese web pages have about the same proportion of text as graphics as do English ones. 
You need to consider where people will be viewing these pages. 
I would suggest that relatively few people would have their own web access if they weren't relatively competent in English, but if they did have, I would expect such a person to already have at least Big 5 (Hong Kong and Taiwan) Chinese support already installed, either through Windows Update, or as one of the commercial bolt ons). 
If they had access in a work place (and I suspect few workers with poor English would have such access), the most common ways of delivering sound (most configurations of Real Media, e.g. those used by the BBC World Service) will not get through many firewalls. 
If they are older people gaining access through the systems owned by younger relatives, those relatives might want to simply interpret the English version, but otherwise, it is probably better to encourage the relatives to install Chinese support (from the Mandarin classes I attend, I get the impression that very few Cantonese speakers actually have it installed, but then a lot of them are not particularly competent in written Chinese). 
That more or less leaves libraries and the like. 
In the UK, where libraries tend to be controlled by the council, I would suggest that you should educate the librarians into installing all the various language packs for their browsers. 
In any case, I haven't noticed many library systems having sound - it would probably encourage purely recreational use, when they are providing the internet access for educational use. 
I can't see people going into an internet cafe to see your pages unless that cafe specifically supports the Cantonese community, in which case they will already have Big5 support, or could be encouraged to add it. 
Chinese pages, in both simplified and traditional characters, is a major component of the web, and some say is about to become the dominant one. 
One other thing about sound. 
On older systems, non-streamed audio really is not streamed, so tends to start a long time after the page displays.
