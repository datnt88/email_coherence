Windows has this wonderful feature called MouseKeys, the keyboard imitating the mouse. 
Today many if not most websites are almost impossible to navigate without a mouse. 
A skilled keyboard user using MouseKeys can actually navigate most if not all mouse-based websites, but not a blind person. 
Is MouseKeys an alternative to making a website accessible for the keyboard in the traditional sense of "tabbing" from link to link, short-cut keys, etc.? 
Is anybody out there using MouseKeys? 
Are they helpful for some in the real world? 
Or are MouseKeys always a very poor alternative to the real keyboard in the traditional sense, and can MouseKeys only be considered a last resort? 
I never use MouseKeys, I have only tested them. 
I'm an expert keyboard user but I mostly use the keyboard and the mouse together, since I have the benefit of being able to use both forms of navigation.

I'd say that it can get VERY tedious and frustrating using mouse keys when you have to move across a lot of screen space even for simple tasks. 
I'd see them as a last resort, or rather a poor excuse for a proper solution. 
IMHO, anyway (and no, I'm not a regular mouse keys user either, so take this as my outsider's opinion) Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford Mouse keys are not available to everyone who cannot use a mouse. 
In the case of someone who uses a single switch device, for example, mouse keys are not a viable option. 
Using an onscreen keyboard, however, Tab is.
