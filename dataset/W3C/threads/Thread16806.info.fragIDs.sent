Thanks Charles for bringing it back to basics, but if I may point out (with the utmost respect to all the learned list) re setting font sizes and successfully navigating around web sites is fine..... for the computer literate. 
In the harsh real world where I operate, as opposed to web designers, government circles and academia, these skills are not in majority. 
I know "let the user choose" is the belief of this list generally. 
It is fair, very reasonable and democratic. 
However, this defeats the independence advantage thus appeal that the internet gives to many disabled people, (i.e where's the problem, let someone re-set the computer for you) It's not just low vision but some cognitive disabilities all have problems with smaller fonts. 
Re-set the font size and suddenly many pages need to scroll in both directions. 
This can present a bigger problem and is a pain anyway. 
How many sighted (low or otherwise) on this list use less than a 17 inch screen? 
Try using a 12 or 15 inch, and see what happens to pages with larger font sizes. 
9 times out of 10 that is all that is affordable to our targeted market place. 
Donated and/or old systems. 
Brookes University is working on the Cognitive problems/browser now (the friend who asked me the original question is assisting in this) Maybe I getting too specific, but how about memory problems? 
In many places in the UK resources need to be shared within various departments/organisations, thus computers constantly need to have settings changed to suit the individuals. 
Not easy to reset settings if you have short term memory problems (hence computer software to remind you what to do) We can not please everyone, I understand this, but we need to please as many as possible. 
In my experience working with many disabled people and charity organisations, they want to be independent and they want to access the internet without the need of a guide or assistant watching over their shoulder. 
I believe they have a right to this simple thing. 
There are no such things as problems, there are situations. 
Every situation has a solution. 
If there is no solution then it is a fact of life. 
We have to learn to live with it. 
It is a fact of life that the majority of disabled people world wide have limited resources at their disposal, because of that their skill base/experience is also limited. 
Allowing the user to choose I believe will not work in the majority of cases. 
(however very happy to be proved wrong) These people are not always aware they have a choice, or if aware they do not know how to exercise it. 
Graham, I would welcome further comments on your email that low vision users prefer non serif fonts, I find this interesting, why please? 
Also can anyone tell me what I have just killed three of, since I started this email? 
They are wasp like but three times the size, nocturnal, brown and yellow (not black and yellow like wasps) brown heads and look evil and deadly. 
I know what a hornet looks like and these aint them. 
Only there are 4 more banging their heads on my now closed window.........If I am not here tomorrow..................................... smiles Paul Davis 
Unrelated, perhaps, but...To the list: What's the general Per-Cap income and unemployment rate of the disabled? 
How far off the usual averages is it? 
I'm looking for US stats, and particularly for the blind, but any data would useful.

John, I heard 78% of disabled people are unemployed. 
I do not have the online source for this. 
If anyone has the details, then please feel free to post them.

Check out the Disabilities Statistics Center's FAQ under "What are the income and poverty levels of people with disabilities?" 
It doesn't break out people who are blind but does provide a source: Kaye, H. S., and Longmore, P. K., (1997). 
Disability Watch: The Status of People with Disabilities in the United States. 
Oakland, CA: Disability Rights Advocates. 
Also take a look at their reports and publications. 
Another source is the International Center for Disability Resources on the Internet (ICDRI). 
They link to a number of documents about employment. 
I haven't looked at any of them, so I don't know how relevant they are.

Information Services Accessibility isn't just the law; it's good business. 
Optimizing Websites for Accessibility, Content, Search &amp; Usability 
Interesting point regarding unemployment, one of the sites I helped into existence was Dish, the Disability Information Service for Hertfordshire, (I still host but they now run it themselves....evolution!!) They are currently running a 2 year program called DEOS (disability employer outreach service) funded by the EEC social fund. 
The aim is to contact and advise potential employers on the DDA and assist with advice on what basic requirements are needed in the workplace. 
Also any Government help that is available to employ disabled people. 
The objective being to get people off state benifits, out of rehab (there are just so many wooden boxes and baskets a person wants to make!!) and into gainfull employment. 
I plan a commercial job agency to work along side Dish's Deos project. 
So DEOS having got agreement to employ disabled people, Ten-20 provides those people. 
I had hoped to bring in a national Job agency to administer to this, thus avoiding duplication of infastructure and costs. 
Brick wall here!! 
So my reach and development is limited to Hertfordshire and my pocket again. 
Oh well, so no change there then, or in my pockets! 
Interestingly I found in my talks with employers and disabled people there seems to be a stalemate here i.e. Large national and international employers say (no reason to doubt them) no disabled people apply for advertised postions, and the disabled people say they are fed up with knock backs because they are disabled. 
I hope to snaffle jobs before they are advertised and present potential employers with a list of candiates.......Is that discrimitory?!!! Lets call it positive discrimination.

Not discrimination at all. 
Advocacy. 
Which is something that, frankly, IMHO, shouldn't just apply to the most basic things like essential human needs, but *especially* things like employment, and, yes, the Web. 
Part of the thing with the Web and the disabled is that we have to not only make sure the Web WORKS for the disabled, but also that it doesn't seem like we're handholding the disabled. 
If we achieve full access, and the able-bodied can not only tell the difference but have reason beyond being bigoted to look down on the disabled... (Say, "Dammit...The damn disabled freaks made me kill the cool Total Graphics Interface") We've failed. 
IMHO, we have to do more than push tech standards, we also have to act as advocates for the disabled AND accessibility. 
For a medium designed by and for geeks, you'd think some of this was basic. 
But, nah. 
Soon as the corps entered the game, accessibility and support for use by the disabled died, or at least took a nap. 
IMHO.
