Chaps, After discussion with Deborah I have uploaded another version of Martin's comments. 
Let's try to publish this on Thursday. 
Please send in any other comments asap, then we'll have a final discussion during the meeting tomorrow. 
Cheers, RI Richard Ishida W3C contact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ W3C Internationalization FAQs RSS feed: http://www.w3.org/International/questions.rss still limping without a disk... so hard to write- here are a few comments. 
It is very good, mostly editorial nits. 1) Can Question be more succint? 
I dont think "removing" is needed it is implied. 
Perhaps change: When I'm using a UTF-8 encoding, why does an extra line appear at the top of my web page in some user agents, and how do I remove it? 
to Why do utf-8 encoded pages show extra lines at the top? 
2) Suggested changes to answer section, para by para- a) Perhaps Change- This may be caused by the presence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file that the user agent doesn't recognize. 
Note that a number of more recent browsers, such as the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do not exhibit this behaviour. 
to: Some user agents do not (yet) treat the UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file properly. 
Many of the more recent browsers, such as the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do process the UTF-8 signature correctly. 
(should we say "windows-based"? 
for Mozilla and Opera it is probably true for other platforms.) b) For the next para, perhaps after "manually" add "with an editor". 
In second sentence perhaps change "can remove" to "automate removal of": To remove the extra line or spaces that appear in the browser, remove the bytes that represent the UTF-8 signature. 
You can remove them manually or with a script. 
One of the benefits of using a script is that you can remove the signature from multiple files. 
c) For next para, I would change "cause of extra line..." to "UTF-8 signature". 
Also, we should include the other way to remove bom- An editor that is bom-aware might have an option to save without the bom. 
So you might not need to edit it, just open and save correctly. 
You may not be able to see the cause of the extra line or space in your editor, if it handles the UTF-8 signature correctly. 
An editor which does not handle the UTF-8 signature correctly displays the bytes that compose that signature according to its own character encoding setting. 
With the Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1) character encoding, the signature displays as extraneous characters ???. 
With a binary editor capable of displaying the hexadecimal byte values in the file, the UTF-8 signature displays as EF BB BF. d) next para is fine, but I would move "thoroughly" after "signature. 
Also instead of "but that" use "but note that only", and add to the end something like ", so look specifically for some of these chars to check." 
You should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature, bearing in mind that pages with a high proportion of Latin characters may look correct superficially but that characters outside the ASCII range (U+0000 to U+007F) may be incorrectly encoded. 
If there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere. 
e) For the following para- how do we mean "include"? 
Also, if embedded in the middle of the file it is likely going to display as something other than blank lines, no? 
Note that if you include text from a separate file that has a UTF-8 signature at the top you may find blank lines appearing within the page, rather than just at the top. 
On Tue, 25 Nov 2003 17:49:19 -0000 Also textpad doesn't always add BOM. 
There is a configuration option which specifies whether to add or not add the bom. 
You can turn it off. 
On Tue, 25 Nov 2003 17:49:19 -0000 Just a few more comments: In the question: "a UTF-8 encoding": How many UTF-8 encodings are there? 
"You should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature"...: This seems to be a general issue about checking whether UTF-8 is really UTF-8, not really related to the BOM. 
Better say so. 
"If there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere.": 
Is that something that appears frequently? 
If not, maybe leave this out. 
If yes, better give some other possible causes. 
I guess we could leave this out. 
The background mentions things such as 'BOM'. 
This is okay. 
But I'm affraid there are quite a few readers who know this thing as 'BOM', so it would help to add "('BOM')" after "UTF-8 signature" in the first paragraph of the answer. 
"Each character in the file is represented by 2 to 4 bytes of data": changing '2 to 4' to '2 or 4' will be more precise. 
3 bytes isn't an option of UTF-16 or UTF-32. 
I think we were talking about taking Helios Textpad out (because it's UTF-8/i18n support is currently marginal). 
Or was this in another context? 
"Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order" - "Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order Mark" Why is there a link to Apache Content Negotiation?
