I'm trying to run an XML file through tidy and it seems to choke on the doctype (the output stops at that line). 
If I remove the line, the file is properly formatted. 
Unfortunately, I need the line in there. 
I could remove it, run it through tidy, and then put it back in, but I'd really prefer not to do that if I don't have to. 
I'm hoping I'm missing some config option or something, but I couldn't find it if I am. Anyway, here's what the beginning of the source file looks like: [...snip...] and after formatting: [end of file] As I said, if I remove the !DOCTYPE tag, it will work fine. 
Any ideas? 
--Brad This is tricky. 
Tidy needs to known when it could safely break the line and when it shouldn't because this would introduce meaningful whitespace. 
I guess it's reasonably safe before the doctype declaration, though.
