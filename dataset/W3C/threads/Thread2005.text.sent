As Larry Masinter's draft IETF meeting notes said, HTTP/1.1 will progress with separate pieces that will be brought together in time for the next IETF meeting. 
I agreed to try to make progress on State-Info (http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/session.html). 
(The actual topic area was "state management", and right now there's only the one draft proposal.) 
I claimed at the meeting, on the basis of http-wg mailing list activity, that there was "rough consensus" for the I-D I wrote, draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt. 
I was advised that I had better confirm that here. 
So, are there dissenting voices? 
(I'm really hesitant to do this just before WWW4! 
How about taking time to read the draft, then responding late next week....) Whether or not there's "rough consensus", there's another important issue: will the browser vendors actually implement it? 
Absent their acceptance, this whole exercise is academic. 
What say ye, Netscape (Lou) and Spyglass (Eric)? 
Others? 
Dave Kristol Dave Kristol: I too remember there being a rough consensus for incorporating draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt into HTTP/1.1. 
Let me try to break this consensus down into three separate issues: 1) Some web services need to maintain session state (where a session is a series of requests and responses between one server and one user agent). 
I don't think anyone on this list would disagree with 1). 
Several existing services (like some games, some cooperative systems, some tele shopping services, some library-like systems) already maintain state, either through ugly, not completely reliable, and cache-unfriendly hacks or by requiring user authentication (which is reliable, but both cache-unfriendly and user-unfriendly). 
2) HTTP/1.1 needs to introduce reliable and cache-friendly mechanisms to support session state. 
I also believe there to be a rough consensus on this. 
I remember someone saying that Java would, among other things, solve the session state problem so why bother also solving it in HTTP, but many people had objections to this reliance on Java. 3) draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt is internally consistent and will offer good session state support. 
I believe there is consensus on draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt being robust, cache-friendly, and easy to implement. 
There recently was some discussion on draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt not addressing its stated privacy concerns, but consensus was reached that draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt does indeed provide adequate privacy. 
There has also been some discussion on scalability: some people think that draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt will not scale to services with a very large number of concurrent sessions and a very large amount of session state. 
I believe there to be at least consensus that, if these large cases exist at all, they will be very rare.

I think this may perhaps be an instance of "consensus by lack of discussion" for which this group ought to be famous. 
Whether there is consensus (of any texture) for it or not, I think the reasonable thing to do under the circumstances is to compare it critically to the Netscape Cookie Proposal, since that is the main competitor for this ecological niche (aside from the actual dominant species, which is URL hacks in all their glory). 
I personally think that the Kristol proposal, to which several members of this group have contributed, is a reasonable and simple solution to the problem, although it does have certain limitations, and we should be clear on the acceptability of those limitations before OKing it. 
I'll try to address some of these issues later -- gotta get some work done today.
