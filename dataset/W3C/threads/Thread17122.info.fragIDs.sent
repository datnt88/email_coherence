<s> Hi, Everyone... I was involved in the project for improving intranet usability.  </s>
<s> So, my team has decided to propose develope style guide for intranet.  </s>
<s> We decide almost of things for style guide... But, now we need to decide the intranet's background color that is comfortable for intranet users... Some peoples said Green or Blue tone colors will be comfortable for eyse of users.  </s>
<s> I don't know What color will be really comfortable for eyes of users who always use them everyday.... and why that color will be comfortable...  </s>
<s> I wanna know what color will be comfortable for intranet and why?  </s>
<s> I hope the reason will be scientific, so everyone can be acceptable for that reason.  </s>
<s> Please give me some advice... Thanx in advance... Tony...from Korea... ^^;;  </s>
<s> Hello Tony, By my personal experience, some users with limited vision prefer Light text on a dark background, as there is less glare associated to the overall monitor screen, reducing eye fatigue.  </s>
<s> An interesting PDF "handout" on this subject can be found at cannot access PDFs).  </s>
<s> It appears to support this fact with other users (with Disabilities) via a controlled study.  </s>
<s> A fairly detailed exchange of ideas on this subject can also be found here:  </s>
<s> dark backgrounds produces less eye strain, but also goes on to suggest that black text on white backgrounds produces the best legibility and thus comprehension/retention.  </s>
<s> So, Tony, there does not appear to be a "magic" answer to the question.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the final answer will depend on the type of information, the length of time users will be using the site/page, etc.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a certain amount of black text on white surrounded by darker, less stressful colours would probably be a good compromise, perhaps something along the lines of what is used by Ziff Davis (http://www.zdnet.com/)?  </s>
<s> Good Luck.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, the latter isn't true for all eyes - the white background can produce glare which can reduce the perceived "thickness" and "sharpness" of the characters displayed on that background.  </s>
<s> Especially the latter (characters not perceived as "sharp") is what causes fatigue - the eyes will constantly try to focus and constantly not get a better result.  </s>
<s> (This is a problem for me personally, a reason why I have "taught" The Proxomitron [1] to filter out white backgrounds from web pages so the background color will revert to my default window background color which is off-white.  </s>
<s> White-on-black is even more tiring, I'm not sure why (possibly because there's not enough light overall) - I only know that my eyes are very sensitive to glare.) For such eyes black on a *light* background (fairly high but not maximum contrast) provides much better legibility - this reduces glare but retains the same advantage of comprehension/retention for all (i.e., including those for whom black on white would also be legible).  </s>
<s> Personally, I never use black on white, or white on black, for the above reason.  </s>
<s> Of course brightness contrast should always be sufficient when seen in grayscale (I use that as a basic test for color-blindness accessibility).  </s>
<s> I've only received a complaint once, from someone who didn't like the color scheme on a site (well, tough).  </s>
<s> Using a light color instead of white (either as background or foreground color) has an added advantage that it can be part of a site's look and feel (or 'branding') for those who can actually perceive the colors.  </s>
