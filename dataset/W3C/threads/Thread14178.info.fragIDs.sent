<s> During the teleconference last week, the "Support for Cognitive Disabilities" issue was discussed.  </s>
<s> The working members on the call felt that we covered the basic issues for cognitive disabilities, but we wanted to bring to the list a discussion of the priority levels of those items.  </s>
<s> The following excerpt is from the Guidelines open issues list (at: Issues We are concerned that there is not a P1 checkpoint specifically for cognitive disability concerns but the group could not come up with any others that didn't seem to already be covered (at their base level - they will be expanded on in the techniques doc).  </s>
<s> During the teleconference we discussed B.3.1 and B.3.2 as possible checkpoints to raise in priority.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint B.3.1 is currently a Priority 2. Could it be raised to Priority 1? "Use the simplest and most straightforward language that is possible for the content of your site.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] " Comments 1.  </s>
<s> We will be requiring people to use "as simple as possible" language.  </s>
<s> 2. It is hard to determine if people follow.  </s>
<s> However, we don't rate things based on how easy it is to comply with but on how necessary it is for access.  </s>
<s> 3. On some sites, simplifying the vocabulary means a loss of precision.  </s>
<s> Will the wording of this guideline address this problem or will people just complain that their sites don't lend themselves to simple language?  </s>
<s> 4. This is similar to what the HTML 4 working group went through with ABBR and ACRONYM.  </s>
<s> They aren't defined that differently in the dictionary, people have different interpretations and UAs already had various implementations.  </s>
<s> Therefore, they decided they didn't need to define the difference between them nor outline how decide which to use; they left them both in. 5. With at least one of these as a Priority 1, we would show strong support for cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint B.3.2 is currently a Priority 3, but might be a Priority 2. "Use icons or graphics (with alternative text) where they facilitate comprehension of the page.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] " 1.  </s>
<s> Should not be a Priority 1 because it is sometimes harder to interpret images rather than words.  </s>
<s> 2. Increasing the priority to at least 2 might decrease the perception that we say "images are bad, don't use them."  </s>
<s> We also considered giving one or both a variable priority, along the lines of, "If the information is important to understanding the page, make it a P1 otherwise P2." thoughts?  </s>

<s> We are concerned that there is not a P1 checkpoint specifically for cognitive disability concerns but the group could not come up with any others that didn't seem to already be covered (at their base level - they will be expanded on in the techniques doc).  </s>
<s> CMN:: I do not like the idea of making something a P1 "to show support" - I think it should only be done because 'failure to do this means some group will be unable to access the content'.  </s>
<s> GV:: Checkpoint B.3.1 is currently a Priority 2. Could it be raised to Priority 1? "Use the simplest and most straightforward language that is possible for the content of your site.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] " CMN:: It could, particularly if we explained why in the rationale.  </s>
<s> Testing of language is a notoriously hard thing to do, but the principle is well-established.  </s>
<s> For example, many countries have made significant attempts to render laws in plain language.  </s>
<s> GV:: Checkpoint B.3.2 is currently a Priority 3, but might be a Priority 2. "Use icons or graphics (with alternative text) where they facilitate comprehension of the page.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] " CMN:: It should.  </s>
<s> My '7 sins and 7 virtues', as its first virtue, says 'use images.  </s>
<s> carefully.'  </s>
<s> They can serve to increase comprehension significantly (hence their popularity) for large groups of people.  </s>
<s> But they have associated problems (as we have discussed) so I don't think they should be a P1. GV:: We also considered giving one or both a variable priority, along the lines of, "If the information is important to understanding the page, make it a P1 otherwise P2." CMN:: I think we should have a general staement in the introduction which says something about important information/functionality, and 'presentational candy' - in the latter case it is acceptable to let the content/function disappear so long as it doesn't break the document.  </s>

<s> I think it is difficult to come up with one solution that helps all, especially with LD. What helps one person will make it more difficult for another.  </s>
<s> I think the only general page authoring mechanism is to ask the author to provide redundent forms of information and hopefully the user agent will allow the user to filter the representations that is most effective for themselves.  </s>
