<s> There are to-go-versions of my docs now at (same URLs as before)  </s>
<s> These have edits made in response to recent points raised by Peter, most notably some of the proofs are rewritten and there are some quick fixes to the Lbase treatment of strings and 'peculiar' names, such as names starting with '(' or including whitespace.  </s>
<s> This version has the rdfD4 rule removed and a consistency comment added in its place.; that seems consistent with the majority view on how best to handle this.  </s>
<s> I can't do any more to these before Wednesday.  </s>
<s> For some reason, the pubrules checker thinks that there is something wrong with the boilerplate, but it seems to have all the links and things that the checker says are missing, all cut-and-pasted from docs that the checker was OK with.  </s>
<s> The other filters are OK.  </s>

<s> There are lots of other possible (and similarly innocuous) problems.  </s>
<s> I just put the new boilerplate into Primer (mostly copied from the latest Concepts), and it now complains about the fact that the word "last call" appears, but there's no ending date (however, it says you can ignore it).  </s>
