Amaya seems to build OK, now that I have lesstif (www.lesstif.org). 
However, on running it I get: ./bin/amaya 
./bin/amaya: 
error in loading shared libraries libXm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
I did not seem to get any warning at configuration time that this might happen. 
Thank you, Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk 
I suggest you use the RPM at : ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-2.1-1.rh52.i386.rpm

Is there one for Alpha, rather than i386? 
Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk 
hum, no, sorry.

libXm.so.1 is the Motif library. 
Could you check your Options file. 
Irene. 
The first time I tried to build it, it said there was no Motif Installing lesstif fixed that error, but the Options below don`t point to any lesstif directories (I installed lesstif in the default place -- maybe configure should know where to look?), but although /usr/local/LessTif/Motif{1.2,2.0}/{include,lib} exist they have not been found by configure. 
Do --x-includes and --x-libraries options for the configure command override the defaults or provide the extra places for configure to look?

Our goal is to automatically generate the file Options when it doesn't exist and let the user change options he wants to change. 
All these changes are never overridden by a new configure. 
Configure overrides the file Options.orig that you can compare with your file Options. 
Otherwise you can remove the file Options before launching the configure. 
Irene.
