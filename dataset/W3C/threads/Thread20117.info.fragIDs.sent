<s> libXm.so.1 is the Motif library.  </s>
<s> Could you check your Options file.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> The first time I tried to build it, it said there was no Motif Installing lesstif fixed that error, but the Options below don`t point to any lesstif directories (I installed lesstif in the default place -- maybe configure should know where to look?), but although /usr/local/LessTif/Motif{1.2,2.0}/{include,lib} exist they have not been found by configure.  </s>
<s> Do --x-includes and --x-libraries options for the configure command override the defaults or provide the extra places for configure to look?  </s>

<s> Our goal is to automatically generate the file Options when it doesn't exist and let the user change options he wants to change.  </s>
<s> All these changes are never overridden by a new configure.  </s>
<s> Configure overrides the file Options.orig that you can compare with your file Options.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you can remove the file Options before launching the configure.  </s>
