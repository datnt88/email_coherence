<s> Excellent Point... at the regular IPP/PWG meeting in San Diego myself and Randy Turner of Sharp noted the need for IPP to make contact with the CONNEG WG and exchange ideas and concepts since IPP is pretty deep into defining capabilities for IPP Printer Objects.  </s>
<s> The CONNEG framework is IMHO perfect for printers...at the very least the framework IPP is considering should not conflict with CONNEG, though 3WC has several proposals on the table for similar concepts specifically in the mobile device area using XML [suprise?].  </s>
<s> I'm very hopeful that the fine work of CONNEG can extend out into other application areas.  </s>
