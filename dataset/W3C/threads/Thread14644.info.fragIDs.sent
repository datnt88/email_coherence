<s> A data model says what information is to be contained in a database, how the information will be used, and how the items in the database will be related to each other.  </s>
<s> For example, a data model might specify that a customer is represented by a customer name and credit card number and a product as a product code and price, and that there is a one-to-many relation between a customer and a product.  </s>
<s> It can be difficult to change a database layout once code has been written and data inserted.  </s>
<s> A well thought-out data model reduces the need for such changes.  </s>
<s> Data modelling enhances application maintainability and future systems may re-use parts of existing models, which should lower development costs.  </s>
<s> A data modelling language is a mathematical formalism with a notation for describing data structures and a set of operations used to manipulate and validate that data.  </s>

<s> an attempted refinement.. Data Model (WC): The way that information is organised.  </s>
<s> For example, a database might contain information about a customer, classified as an address, a name, a birthdate, and a picture.  </s>
<s> A web page might contain a list of lists, where each sub-list contains (in order) a family name, an initial, a street, a city, and a URI.  </s>
<s> These data models are slightly different, but so long as the model is explicit about what things are represented it is often posssible for either people (using their own knowledge) or computers (using technologies like XML schema) to do sensible conversions or comparisons between information using different data models.  </s>
<s> An explicit data model also helps a user to provide a personalised presentation.  </s>

<s> AG:: I wasn't in on the discussion, so I can demonstrate ignorance without shame.  </s>
<s> Assumption: There is somewhere in the drafts of the principles a statement that the content should provide necessary information either "in markup or in an associated data model."  </s>
<s> If that is what needs explanation, then a general discourse on data models is not necessarily necessary.  </s>
<s> What we really need to make clear is the difference that forced us to say either/or in the above.  </s>
<s> In this case, the "associated model" is knowledge that is not spelled out in the markup itself but can be reliably associated with items in the content by pattern matching against the markup.  </s>
<s> Short definition: A data model is something which publishes patterns or rules which aid in the interpretation of data.  </s>
<s> Where we are headed is a pattern of practice which says: a) use these marks (markup definition) and b) interpret those marks in the following way (model definition).  </s>
<s> The markup and model work hand in hand to convey what the User Agent needs to know to have flexible presentation and interaction-control capability reconstructed in the User Agent and delivered to the user.  </s>
<s> Example of application of data models to accessibility: tables.  </s>
<s> A proper model for tables in XHTML would define columns, and not just rows.  </s>
<s> What column or columns a TD cell is in can be reliably reconstructed from textual order of the cells in a TR row and the 'colspan' attributes of the cells you have passed over already in the row.  </s>
<s> A model would spell this out, so that a "myColumn" query against a cell would be well defined and implemented alike in all XHTML table implementations.  </s>
<s> Because this can be reconstructed given the present markup, we don't want to add markup.  </s>
<s> But we want the standard interpretation spelled out so the content can reliably be referenced in this way by User Agents.  </s>
<s> Homework exercise.  </s>
<s> To understand the possible role of models in defining formats, consider doing an HTML table as an application of the XForms work.  </s>
<s> That is to say, a table is a degenerate form where all the fields are defined constants, and don't accept user input.  </s>
<s> This would give you a data structure in the document with a model behind it.  </s>
<s> Second Example: assistive tracks in multimedia.  </s>
<s> We have a variety of flavors of these.  </s>
<s> Descriptions of the video presented in audio.  </s>
<s> Descriptions of the video presented in timed text.  </s>
<s> Replication of the dialog in timed text (subtitles).  </s>
<s> Replication and orientation to the dialog in timed text (captions).  </s>
<s> Text representing the multitrack multimedia ensemble in a form capable of un-timed reading (script or collated transcript).  </s>
<s> These are but a few examples We are very concerned as to how do we capture what media objects are there, and how do they relate to one another, with enough information so that a User Agent can understand how they can be used to satisfy the needs and desires of a user.  </s>
<s> This is important so we can be sure that SMIL 2.0 has enough expressive capability to say what needs to be said.  </s>
<s> This is urgent because the CANARIE project is building prototypes of multimedia archives that will be played with the aid of (under the rules of) some such model.  </s>
<s> And it is needed by the User Agent Working Group so they are confident that they have asked the right kind of things of players in interpreting and offering user control over the content.  </s>
<s> Note: for those of you into computer math, the breakpoint is this: The relationships that we need to understand among the various media objects in an accessible multimedia resource form a graph.  </s>
<s> A collated transcript contains equivalents for more than one of the other media objects, but not necessarily for all of them.  </s>
<s> The model that one can build with an XML DTD is a tree structure.  </s>
<s> There are references to other elements by ID that make the model of the XML document a graph and not just a tree, but the DTD capabilities give us no way to say what those arcs mean, or how they are to be interpreted.  </s>
<s> For this we must rely on an additional model that defines the structure of the semantic graph.  </s>
<s> Our alternatives are to define the XML application straight off in XML Schema or to use mixed model-building media by having a core tree constructed with an XML DTD and annotated by RDF which completes the model as an overlay on the structural armature that the XML DTD lays out.  </s>
<s> The latter construction method is what we have at present in SVG and SMIL.  </s>
<s> We need an application or requirements model which captures the information requirements or preconditions for graceful transformation, and an implementation or format model which allocates this information into encodings in the element attributes and metadata structures of the mixed-mode dialects of SMIL and SVG.  </s>
<s> Sometimes it helps to look at the information in these two {as required, as coded} views.  </s>
<s> Sometimes one can do it in one pass, but the results are not always satisfactory.  </s>
<s> Warning: we probably need to capture and understand more than one 'definition' for data model to have this topic under control.  </s>
<s> In the world around us, people use the phrase in a variety of senses, some broader, some narrower; and we _probably will need to touch all those meanings at some point_ so we need to be able to lump or distinguish them at different times, and might as well have our map of the meanings in hand to guide us as we go.  </s>
<s> In fact, in our application -- capturing information in web content that enables and facilitates the graceful transformation of the essential information into diverse and thereby adaptive presentations -- we will be dealing with multiple types of data models (in the broadest sense) and data models that are of different classes or fill different roles.  </s>
<s> References: groups that use the term 'data model' or simply 'model' that we will want to care about include: RDF model and syntax, XML Schema Working Group, and the XForms Working Group.  </s>
<s> In addition we will want to understand the connection between object oriented modeling and data modeling.  </s>
<s> Because information content is about what people perceive and understand, and people perceive and understand things in terms of how the act, not just what properties they exhibit or what constituents they contain.  </s>
<s> For a mind-bending exercise, study the following two papers on model mediation, where there are actually multiple models spelled out in computer-interpretable formality, interacting to create a composite capability, a composite resource.  </s>
