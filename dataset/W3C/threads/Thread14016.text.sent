Is there an agenda for today's meeting?

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Unfortunately Wendy and Ian are unavailable until the call (and not online I think) and Chuck is on vacation. 
I suspect there will not be an agenda published in advance (although I would be happy to be wrong) Charles McCN Is there an agenda for today's meeting?
