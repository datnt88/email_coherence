<s> First the question:  </s>
<s> How the HECK do you enter a copyright symbol or other special symbol?  </s>
<s> Other than editing the source outside of amaya and typing in &amp;copy; there, or similarly, that is.  </s>
<s> Yes I did try using the Char Map applet to insert the symbol.  </s>
<s> I checked the copyright symbol's input code and it is alt+0184; I held alt and typed 0184 on the numpad to insert it, and it inserted a comma instead.  </s>
<s> It inserts a copyright symbol into Notepad or Word, so it's a quirk of Amaya that it reacts like this to attempts to insert special characters -- some would say a bug.  </s>
<s> I was hoping Amaya would get the correct character from that key combination and would intelligently recognize it as a special character and recognize it as something that should translate as &amp;copy;.  </s>
<s> I also looked at the Help option Creating Elements (the closest topic to what I want, which is CReating Special CHaracters).  </s>
<s> I also looked at all the possibly-relevant menu items and found none.  </s>
<s> I would have expected there to be a menu item, probably in Types or Edit, named Special Character... that would pop up a special character input palette resembling the math symbol palette that is useful when editing equations.  </s>
<s> Alas, Amaya appears to lack this  </s>
<s> feature.  </s>
<s> (Version 2.0a.) How are users expected to enter a copyright symbol?  </s>
<s> Surely not by editing the source in a third-party app and inserting &amp;copy; there?!  </s>
<s> As for the quirks: I've noticed that when IE and AMaya are open at the same time, there seems to be a weird interaction.  </s>
<s> Some Amaya windows act funny, often with their icons vanishing or turning black and white on the task bar; math palettes may not display or work right; and images may disappear, becoming invisible while still being clickable and manipulable.  </s>
<s> When this happens, IE also acts strangely, displaying garbled Web pages or Web pages with parts missing, especially tending to garble images and tending to garble pages that have many images.  </s>
<s> I think it may be some quirk in the HTML rendering part of the Windows 98 OS.  </s>
<s> It is unclear whether it's an OS bug, an IE bug, or an Amaya bug; your developers may be able to shed more light on it, assuming they have access to a Windows 98 machine with IE5.  </s>

<s> Paul, Did you make sure that you had the Windows charmap applet set for the Times New Roman font?  </s>
<s> In my experience, that's the font to which you must set the applet for its characters to display properly when transferred to working docs opened in other apps.  </s>
<s> The input code for the copyright symbol in Times New Roman is alt+0169.  </s>
<s> See if that doesn't work.  </s>
<s> I'd test it for ya but I haven't installed Amaya yet, and after reading about all the bugs, I may just wait for the next version!  </s>
<s> Mike  </s>
<s> [MCepl] First, I would love to support unhappy Paul, because I am unhappy too.  </s>
<s> For me, it is not as much the case of &amp;copy; but I am missing &amp;nbsp;.  </s>
<s> I am lawyer so all my texts are full of &amp;sect;&amp;nbsp; some number .  </s>
<s> Somebody told, that proper is Ctrl+ SPC but on my Windows setup it includes normal space (&amp;#20;) rather than non-breaking one.  </s>
<s> Also, I would not be happy to use Alt+ number as the result ought to be some named entity (&amp;copy; or &amp;nbsp;) rather than hard-coded character.  </s>
<s> How would one setup my keyboard in Amaya, so that it includes any entity I wish?  </s>
<s> Matthew  </s>
<s> [MCepl] to complete my previous message: Ctrl+ SPC doesn't work notwithstanding the fact, that I DO have Ctrl Key Space: TtcInsertChar("\240") in amaya.keyboard.txt  </s>
<s> file.  </s>

<s> In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 17 Jun 1999 14:13:59 +0100."  </s>
<s> You can setup keyboard by creating a personal file amaya.kb  </s>
<s> (windows) or amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> (unix) See how to configure Amaya Due to a bug, Ctrl+ SPC doesn't work on Windows platform We're fixing that bug.  </s>
