try the following markup XYZ Company A HREF="logo.html" TITLE="Logo description" logo description /A Charles McCathieNevile Does anyone see a problem with OBJECT's lack of a LONGDESC attribute for long descriptions? 
OBJECT can contain markup for a rich alternative to the embedded object, but there is no method of giving a richer description than the TITLE attribute can provide. 
Consider, for example, a company logo, which I might mark up as follows if using OBJECT: OBJECT data="logo.gif" title="XYZ Company Logo" XYZ Company /OBJECT A company logo could benefit from a long description, but that's not possible except by removing the seamless accessibility of the preceding example and placing the long description within the OBJECT element. 
When we start mixing an object's description and replacement (as has long been done with IMG's ALT attribute), we make it difficult for user agents to render content without the seams from a visual Web becoming a distraction.

Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development LQ:: Sure, but what about my last sentence: LQ:: I won't use long descriptions if it means that seamless accessibility becomes impossible. 
(This is why I don't use D-links.) Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development If seamless accessibility means presenting different material to different audiences, each audience not knowing what the other is getting, then I am not at all in favour of it. 
I am, like I suspect most people here, in favour of solutions to accessibilty problems which do not rely on the 'get a life - download hotbrowser version 567 for the BBC Micro to see this website' approach. 
Charles McCathieNevile I agree with Charles. 
"Separate but Equal" is not the answer here.
