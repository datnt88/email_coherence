<s> Question: How can a CSSValueList possibly know how to generate a cssText value?  </s>
<s> Background: DOM 2, 10 May, 2000  </s>
<s> 1. A CSSValueList is a CSSValue.  </s>
<s> CSSValue must return a cssText value, which is how the value should be represented in the document.  </s>
<s> Therefore, CSSValueList should return a cssText value.  </s>
<s> 2. A CSSValueList has no knowledge of which property name its values are for.  </s>
<s> 3. A CSSValueList can hold values for font-family and text-decoration.  </s>
<s> 4. font-family requires a list of font names to be separated by commas, while text-decoration requires the list to be separated by whitespace, as far as I can tell.  </s>
<s> (There doesn't seem to be any explicit examples of multiple text-decoration values, but the grammar certainly allows it.) So if a CSSValueList wants to generate text for its list (each of which is a CSSPrimitiveValue) using the cssText property, how can it know how its list items should be separated?  </s>
<s> It seems the value of cssText would be different depending on whether the CSSValueList holds values for font-family or text-decoration, just to give one example.  </s>
<s> I'd appreciate anyone telling me what I'm missing here.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Garret garret@globalmentor.com  </s>
<s> This is where you have been mislead.  </s>
<s> The specification states: "The CSSValue interface represents a simple or a complex value.  </s>
<s> A CSSValue object only occurs in a context of a CSS property."  </s>
<s> If the CSSValue had no knowledge of its property then there would be a problem with both the retreival of cssText and the parsing of the text during a set.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> Blaine, Ah, there's the catch.  </s>
<s> Knowing which property a CSSValue is for will certainly help implementation, given that a CSSValue can be rendered in several ways depending on the property.  </s>
<s> Whether or not such a design is very elegant is a different matter, and I guess that, with CSS already having several ways to represent lists, there may not be much else that can be done.  </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing that out.  </s>
