Just a brief note to say that in the course of my accessibility related activities concerning various public UK websites, I've come across clear evidence that the BBC is addressing the accessibility issue positively. 
Whilst this is very good news and something to be warmly welcomed, it is very important that people should continue to write in to the BBC to express their concern about accessibility issues, and will continue to be important until such time as every IMG on their sites ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/ and http://www.beeb.com/ ) has a meaningful ALT attribute, and every whizz-bang impediment to accessibility has gone.

I don't think this is true for all of _my_ sites, even.

Vice President, Marketing and Outreach, HTML Writers Guild actually that is good to hear -- as a long time listener of the World Service I was disgusted by their WWW site. 
At one point there was a message here soliciting access feedback and stating that the BBC was "interested" -- but both then and earlier all I got for in return for writing to them was a canned reply. 
And their site has more than alt text problems, they abuse tables extensively and it would take a major AI project to extract any kind of structure out of their pages.
