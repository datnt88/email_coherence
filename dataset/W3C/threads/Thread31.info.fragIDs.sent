<s> I'm trying to run an XML file through tidy and it seems to choke on the doctype (the output stops at that line).  </s>
<s> If I remove the line, the file is properly formatted.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I need the line in there.  </s>
<s> I could remove it, run it through tidy, and then put it back in, but I'd really prefer not to do that if I don't have to.  </s>
<s> I'm hoping I'm missing some config option or something, but I couldn't find it if I am. Anyway, here's what the beginning of the source file looks like: [...snip...] and after formatting: [end of file] As I said, if I remove the !DOCTYPE tag, it will work fine.  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>
<s> --Brad  </s>
<s> This is tricky.  </s>
<s> Tidy needs to known when it could safely break the line and when it shouldn't because this would introduce meaningful whitespace.  </s>
<s> I guess it's reasonably safe before the doctype declaration, though.  </s>
