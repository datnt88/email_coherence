<s> OK, I was wavering before, but now you've pushed me over the edge.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> believe it is reasonable to do what you want, and you shouldn't have to do a "write" operation to get it.  </s>
<s> So I propose the following:  </s>
<s> Add a DAV:baseline-collection property on a baseline, which holds a DAV:href containing a server-defined URL.  </s>
<s> This URL identifies  </s>
<s> a read-only collection that exposes that baseline as a collection.  </s>
<s> Access to that read-only collection would be the message to the  </s>
<s> server to "cache" that baseline as a collection.  </s>
<s> The server would then just have to automatically clean up that cache when it needs the space, rather than counting on a DELETE from the client to tell it when to do so.  </s>
<s> This is a burden on the server, but probably not an unreasonable one.  </s>
<s> In particular, I don't think that Greg's will be the only server that will have very different performance/implementation tradeoffs for a read-only view of a baseline (what Greg wants) and a writeable view of a baseline (aka a workspace).  </s>
<s> Conceivably, I could get the version-history for a given VCR, use a DAV:baseline-version report to find the specific version of that collection, get the collection version's members and execute DAV:baseline-version on those, etc.  </s>
<s> But this is a far cry from random-access to a specific path within a baseline.  </s>
<s> Yes, that would be really gross.  </s>
<s> Note that I can't simply use the Depth: header, as that would apply "once" to the collection version history (which has no children); the Depth header would not apply to the collection versions.  </s>
<s> Yes, that wouldn't work.  </s>
<s> So, Greg: Does the DAV:baseline-collection property on a baseline give you what you want (I presume, yes).  </s>
<s> So, everyone else: any objections?  </s>
<s> (For Greg at least, I presume, no :-).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> No objections at all, on the contrary: I'd really like to have this property.  </s>

<s> No objections at all, on the contrary: I'd really like to have this property.  </s>
<s> Also note that this property allows us to get rid of the DAV:baseline-version-set property, since you can get the same information by doing a PROPFIND for the DAV:checked-in values in this collection.  </s>
<s> This is probably cleaner anyway, since the DAV:version-set property had scalability problems (just imagine how useful it would be to get the DAV:version-set property of a baseline with 10,000 elements).  </s>
<s> In contrast, with the collection approach, you can just obtain the version info for a particular resource or subtree of interest.  </s>

<s> No objections here, boss.  </s>
<s> How'd you guess?  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Yes, I'd prefer to see that nuked.  </s>
<s> As you point out later, it scales poorly and it has little utility anyways.  </s>
<s> Somebody mentioned "four implementations" of DeltaV that were occurring.  </s>
<s> Have we seen feature sets from any of these other three?  </s>
<s> I'd be interested in what others are implementing.  </s>

<s> hehe :-)  </s>
<s> Speaking for Subversion, this isn't actually a burden as we'll synthesize the collection as the user requests it.  </s>
<s> (i.e. we don't have to worry about constructing and tossing a set of baseline resources) [ well, asking for an old baseline will be a bit painful since we use a reverse-delta storage system, but I believe the intent is to cache those as part of normal operation (meaning the new baseline collection won't burden us any more than we already had) ] Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
