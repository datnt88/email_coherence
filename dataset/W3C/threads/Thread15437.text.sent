Hello, In the fall of 2003, the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the American Institutes for Research (AIR) conducted a series of usability tests of the WAI Web site: http://www.w3c.org/wai/. 
The AIR report is available [1]. 
Specific for this discussion, I highly recommend that you read "Key Findings." 
[2] On Wednesday's Techniques Task Force teleconference, several of us took an action item to create a prototype to demonstrate linking from guidelines and success criteria to the techniques gateway and then from the gateway to the technology-specifics (David, Michael, Ben, Tom, Chris, and me). 
In this discussion it also became clear to us that we need to separate the "traffic cop" functionality of the techniques gateway from the general, non-technology-specific techniques (similar to the WCAG 1.0 approach where we had Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [3] as "traffic cop" and Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [4] for non-technology-specific techniques). 
Yesterday, Shawn and I discussed a mock-up of various options of linking from Guidelines/success criteria to techniques. 
Option 5 [5] is a result of this discussion and attempts to address the following factors that were noticed during the AIR usability testing: 1. 
When looking for "how to" information, people were looking for links that said, "how to" or "example." 
The links marked "Technique for Checkpoint..." did not trigger an association with the material they were looking for. 
2. Most people are not familiar with the numbering scheme. 
i.e., most people do not refer to "Checkpoint 1.1" they think in terms of "provide text equivalents." 
A link that says, "Techniques for Checkpoint 1.1" does not trigger an association with "how to" information for this checkpoint - it doesn't have any "scent." 
[6,7] 3. In WCAG 1.0, there are 65 links of the form, "Techniques for Checkpoint X.Y." These links could be ignored because they don't obviously provide new or related information. 
(Shawn - feel free to add additional thoughts or clarify any of these) Thus, it seems less an issue of formatting the links and more an issue of writing good link text. 
Thoughts?

--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative This is tremendously interesting news and I quite strongly commend WAI for doing this kind of research.

Expect criticism if you top-post Loose comments... ...and every usability consultant and/or company linking to a page where you already are [1] is inconceivably credible (that's almost always the first that catches my eye). 
I cannot resist -- it's unbelievable what professionals don't know the basics of their domain, CMIIW. 
ACK, some findings definitely confirm this. 
By the way, maybe you remember LSA (Latent Semantics Analysis), a rather scientific method calculating the familiarity of links (by determining the vector length of a term) [2]? 
Though, I think that stuff (including CWW [3]) is /really/ scientific ;) Best regards, Jens.
