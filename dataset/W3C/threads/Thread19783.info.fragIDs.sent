Hello, I'm currently busy writing a server application which depends on clients using http/put to supply documents. 
Behind the scene there is a non traditional approach working which will eventually hide files from the user interface (those are treated to be an implementation detail). 
Unfortuntly amaya writes the images before the actual document. 
This seems to be ok at the first glance because the other way around (as netscape does, writing the html first followed by the imgs) introduces the chance to request non-existing documents. 
Looking at my new system there are no files visible. 
Hence the html page must be saved before the imgs because the imanges are assoziated with th page and I need the page to store the reference. 
To a little more into the details: there is also a history associated with the page. 
The way amaya saves the img either gets associated with the last page in sequence or for new pages (there os no reference to the picture) garbage collected. 
It would be possible to keep all imgs accociated with the old document but this would be a hack. 
Another less hard problem is amaya always complaining when a document I try to save gets redirected by the server upon the next read. 
I need to do this in any case. 
Would it be hard to change that (maybe configurable)? 
Thanx /jerry 
Hello Joerg, I think it's a good suggestion to save the document file before images. 
I'll change that in next release. 
Concerning redirected pages, I'll discuss with Jose Kahan who has in charge this part of code. 
Regards Irene.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hello Irene, 
Is there a date at the horizone when the next version will be released? 
If this is later than the first half of jan98 it would be quite a brake in my work, hence I would be interested in a patch. 
Hm, meanwhile I'm no longer sure which one is the better way around. 
As I said, I treat every document somewhat like a directory and all those pictures like dir entries. 
Having the document already in place makes things easier at the first glance. 
But after thinking twice about it I realized that I could associate another idea with the reception of the document body: the document is final at that moment. 
Every submission of further content would then be associated with the next version. 
After implementing this policy I became quite happy with that idea. 
The only draw back is that netscape (or whatever) users will have to submit another request to close the document. 
After all It remains merly a philosophical question. 
But concerning the question of compatibility it might be more important to behave all the software same than better. 
Anybody with ideas.
