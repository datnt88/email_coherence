<s> Hi. First of all, please forgive my ignorance about this subject.  </s>
<s> I have downloaded, and printed, the DOM Level 1 Spec and think I have got the general idea.  </s>
<s> Also, I have downloaded the Java-bindings.zip file and have amended my CLASSPATH to point to the class files.  </s>
<s> My question is, how do I actually USE the Java Bindings classes?  </s>
<s> I don' t mean how do I use the interfaces, but how do I get access to the interfaces from within Java.  </s>
<s> Do I need to import the classes, or something?  </s>
<s> Ultimately, I want to be able to dynamically alter an HTML document using the HTML Bindings.  </s>
<s> Regards John Duffy jbduffy@cwcom.net  </s>
<s> Hello, I have another Java language binding question: Why is the DOMException artificially made abstract?  </s>

<s> Sent:27 January 2000 22:33 Subject:Re: Another Java Language Binding Question I don't know what you mean by "artificially", but the reason it is abstract is that it's the closest we could get to an interface.  </s>
<s> Ideally the DOM java binding would only define interfaces.  </s>
<s> This is unfortunately impossible due to the way Java defines exceptions.  </s>
