What is "accessible markup"? 
It needs to be spelled out. 
For example, is ABBR accessible markup? 
A list of immutable tags and attributes should be provided. 
The Guideline 4.4 - Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain accessible markup and content is essentially restating techniques from other guidelines. 
If we beefed up the current technique 4.1.1 to mention conversion tools as a specific example, then the declaration of scope which is currently in the Introduction makes it clear that the guidelines apply to such tools. 
(Conversion tools allow the user to save a file as HTML although that is not the usual format of their input files. 
This covers both desktop publishing packages which can save as HTML, and translation tools which convert between formats, such as PDF to HTML conversion tools) --Charles McCathieNevile W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (visiting) mail: LCS, 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA Or a link to the accessibility features of HTML 4.0 and CSS-2 which is here: Although no one's fully implemented HTML 4.0 nor any of CSS-2.

Currently the definition is 'as specified in the Page Author Guidelines'. 
(section something or other) I think that is correct in spirit. 
Although PAGL is still a WD it has become fairly stable, and will almost certainly be a recommendation by the time we settle this document. 
As a proposal, I suggest we make the follwing definition: Accessible markup Markup which conforms to the W3C Page Author Guidelines [ref] charles What is "accessible markup"? 
It needs to be spelled out. 
For example, is ABBR accessible markup? 
A list of immutable tags and attributes should be provided. 
I thought this may be of interest to AU people. 
Now that they've acquired GoLive, this is more of a reason for them to be not only accessibility compliant but heeding standards for all of their products.

Those URLs are a press release - not a specification for what tags and attributes need to be preserved. 
The original question was : 

The Guideline 4.4 - Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain accessible markup and content What is accessible markup? 
How does it differ from inaccessible markup? 
Maybe this is semantics, but 4.4 is vague. 
Are you trying to say that an Authoring Tool should not strip ALT attributes when converting web sites? 
Then say that. 
Are you trying to say that an Authoring Tool should use LABEL tags for form controls? 
Okay, then say that. 
See my point?

You do have a valid point. 
I do believe we need to get more specific. 
I'm afraid if we don't get more specific, Authoring Tool companies will skirt the issues.
