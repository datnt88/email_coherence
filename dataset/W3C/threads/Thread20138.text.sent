just downloaded amaya and trying to configure after running several other browsers since Web started have noted several glitches in documentation and how amaya does some common things [1] setting home page amaya requires FULL url including http:// this is fair but the on-line help could have been more HELPful by noting this. 
This retired teacher knows that EXAMPLES help in readability. 
Perhaps reviewing the on-line help and adding examples to topics will help others as well. 
[2] Color settings Using the dialog box --- will it respect all named colors will it accept hex codings, or decimal coding alternates. 
The help page is silent on this and once again exampleS would make it clear. 
And the named colors i picked didnt even come close to rendering correctly -- my favorite is 'wheat' which is easy on the eyes but try it in Amaya --- a dithered blue ugh! 
Using the pallet -- and quite an unusual one it is instead of the one seen in most programs --- may be a unix thing though i am much more familiar with windows and this one may be necessary for cross platform --- its a shame cuz it severely restricts one's choice. 
The selected colors did not display when the apply button was pressed... i had to exit Amaya and restart it to see effect. 
This does not foster experimentation does it. 
Apply should apply immediately.... 
I loaded Amaya to experiment with MathMl so i expect i will be happier with it as there is no standard of comparison ie no competition.... but on standard user expected features there seems a ways to go ... and the documentation is about right for the price paid :-) :-) Hello John, Thank you for your time spent criticizing the Amaya doc. 
Yes, it needs a full URL, or a filesystem URL, depending on whether your home page is on-line or local. 
Note that we use the term home page more in the sense of "first page that Amaya should show when launched". 
It accepts both named colors and RGB encoded strings. 
If it doesn't find such color, it'll use the default ones. 
This week I'm away from the office, so I can't send/update the doc with a more meaningful example. 
Our color palette may be wrong. 
I suppose you're using Windows? 
Yes, it's the same for code compatiblity reasons. 
In the doc, it says: "The color changes will be effective when you open a new document window or when reloading a document." 
For the moment, these changes are not visibly immediately. 
Right. 
Unfortunately, we have very limited resources... but in one of your follow up mails you give a suggestion... wait till I get there :) -Jose Hi John, We completely agree with you. 
The documentation is incomplete, sometimes unclear and needs more examples. 
Our problem is that first, we have limited resources and second, developers are not the best peoples able to write documentation. 
We will be very happy to have contributors to the Amaya documentation. 
We're ready to add their name as Amaya contributors.

Yes. 
This is not normal. 
It should react immediatly. 
Could you give us a specific scenario where the error occurs.
