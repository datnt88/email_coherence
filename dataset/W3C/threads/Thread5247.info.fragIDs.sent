At its 02/13 teleconference, the TT WG resolved the following: 
1. The TT WG will produce an authoring specification. 
The specification will allow for transcoding and transformations to streaming formats. 
2. Any specification for a streaming format will be deferred to a later time (if produced at all).

Did I miss the minutes, or have they not been posted yet? 
I can't seem to find them online but I'd like to read about the rationale behind these two resolutions.

The minutes haven't been posted yet, and would not offer much detail here. 
The primary rationale was that this was what the WG members felt should be given the highest priority based upon their needs and expectations.
