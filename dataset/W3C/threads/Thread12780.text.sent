OBJECTIVE: Make Macromedia FLASH accessible via alternate methods? 
Has anyone done this? 
This is what we are thinking and please chime in...we are working with Macromedia Flash and not other macromedia formats. 
We have two premises: (1)If the FLASH plug-in is not used, provide an alternate method viewing and reading .. For example an image or a text (2)If the FLASH plug-in is used, provide FLASH FILE and an alternate method to either view OR reading, preferably read for web browsers with the plug-in turned off, screen readers, pwWebSpeak. 
For example as in an ALT tag or text and or TITLE tag. 
Please read the bottom message to understand my comments to Ken our developer and Charles. 
Ken: Hmm, nice thought...but we need the FLASH for the ZOOM-ing and other reasons. 
Charles, pls read below and circulate if you like. 
Ken do you agree? 
/rob Rob, I may have found the most expedient and elegant solution to our dilemma possible. 
In most instances, we can merely tell generator to display the output as a GIF instead of a flash image. 
Try this link to see it in action.

The code changes are minimal, but it will have the following limitations: - they can't zoom-in on the maps (it's a gif) - the "learn more about the 50 state quarters" page will probably have to stay as a flash piece, because it is interactive (i.e. they can click on a state) - the Fed Reserve Banks page will also have to stay as flash, because of the roll-overs. 
- the image doesn't immediately begin to stream to the display there are also the following advantages: - smaller download (the gifs should be around 12k) - no need for plug-ins (at all) - can alt-tag the heck out of them Thoughts?

In fact a SMIL presentation is probably more accessible than flash - there are several players, including open-source stuff and the Real Networks G2 player. 
But you can put that into an object cascade along with the flash version, a quicktime movie (there are circumstances where that is a good alternative) and a number of other versions... Charles McCN On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, Robert i was thinking another way to make Macromedia Flash Accessible for those who do not want to download the software. 
Seems there is a way to make an image display if you do not have the plug-in. 
Of course, if you have an image then we can have an ALT tag, where we can describe the visual presentation. 
comments?

We can use this technique in conjunction with the javascript code to detect whether or not they have flash installed, and show the generated gif as the alternate image. 
This will: - allow those who have flash installed to see the zoomable flash version - allow those who don't (or don't want to install it) to see the actual map. 
This would also support special needs, as the alt tag would carry through.

Charles McCN On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, Robert i was Seems there is a way to make an image display if you do not have I have created and used Flash files on my family genealogy web site (www.denmon.org) in my grad education @ NYU's Interactive Telecomm program course work, but also have included on the page a static image for browsers that don't have the plug-in...if I may put in my two cents. 
(I have also used Director, as well--Director 7.0 seem slightly better, but I have not worked with it enough to know...any thoughts?) 
Here at the Lighthouse we are working on redesigning the site (www.lighthouse.org) and accessibility issues are a high priority in this process. 
We would like to include animations and audio and how to better understand the ways inwhich we can incorporate this type of design usability. 
...thank you for letting me chime in; look forward to hearing what others are doing and our continued dialog.
