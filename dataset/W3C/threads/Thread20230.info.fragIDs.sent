<s> I am using Amaya v2.2 on an iP100, 32MB RAM ... both the Win98 and the Linux versions have the following problem: when I try to display any page with the lang attribute of the html element set to "cs", all I can see is some ugly font, without any formatting (e.g. there is no difference between paragraph text and header text).  </s>
