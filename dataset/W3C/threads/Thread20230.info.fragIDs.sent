I am using Amaya v2.2 on an iP100, 32MB RAM ... both the Win98 and the Linux versions have the following problem: when I try to display any page with the lang attribute of the html element set to "cs", all I can see is some ugly font, without any formatting (e.g. there is no difference between paragraph text and header text). 
When I change the value to "cz", everything is all right. 
But the code for the Czech language is "cs" - at least according to

Hi, Amaya is not yet fully internationalized. 
Actually we are working on that.

"cz" is not a valid language, so Amaya used Iso-Latin-1 charset and it 
seemed OK for you. 
With the 2.3 release you should display "cs" documents on Linux platforms provided that you have fonts available to display Iso-Latin-2. 
As Ramzi explained we're working on a real internationalized version of Amaya. 
Regards Irene. 
I downloaded the Win binary of 2.3 at 5:10 pm EST and it did a poor job of 
rendering text in tables - even on the startup page! 
It looks like it's 
rendering all columns as very narrow. 
Could this be a bug in the build, or 
do I have some kind of configuration problem? 
I installed over 2.2.

In our previous episode, Patrick T. Rourke said: 
This is a new problem. 
The temporary solution is to uninstall 2.2 before 
installing 2.3. 
Otherwise some files from 2.2 are being used with 2.3 and this causes the problem. 
See this Amaya as a one-day pre-release. 
We didn't make yet an 
official announcement. 
Tomorrow we'll prepare a new one. 
I just fixed some problems that John Russel reported on cache and tmpdirs that have spaces. 
I encourage you and other people who have downloaded it already, and are willing to, to test it and report back to us. 
We'll try to fix any remaining 
bugs tomorrow and do the official release. 
Thanks and we apologize for the confusion this non-announced release could make.

Thanks, that did it! 
Now that I've uninstalled 2.2 and installed 2.3 (on a different computer), 
it displays pages that were originally created in Amaya well. 
The only problems I've noticed so far have been a tendency to skip an entry 
or two on the history list when using the back and forward buttons, a 
recurrence of a "cannot make a connection to the server" message and consequent failure to load a few long pages on one particular server (possibly anomalous), poor rendering of the position of table elements on pages that I'm quite sure aren't valid HTML anyway, and a dislike of long urls like this one - but only when they occur in a link, not when typed into the location bar (sorry about the wrap): a

homepage (obvious URL), you'll see what I mean. 
Is this a standardization issue: are these lookup urls longer than a prescribed maximum in one of the W3C standards? 
Finally, it does crash a little bit, but the crashes don't seem to be reproducible, so they're probably not bug-related. 
Hope some of this is helpful. 
Again, this is Win98 with (in this case) a Pentium 2.

No problem. 
I figured it was semi-official and that I'd missed the announcement on the list. 
You've (plural) been alluding to it all week, so .

No, the &amp;'s are delimiting the arguments of a GET-style CGI query. 
However, the &amp; before lookup is unnecessary, and may be confusing things.

Thanks, Richard (by the way, did you know that you have a setting requesting return receipt on your email?). 
I'm sorry, but I did not believe that bit about using named entities in CGI GET URLs. 
However, I have seen the same long URL problem in 2.3 with CGI-based requests that did not have that extra ampersand. 
Use 2.3 to view e.g. the Boston.com 
homepage. 
Or just paste my code below into a page and remove the extra ampersand. 
I note, by the way, that HTML-Tidy also truncates the CGI GET requests and misreads the later values as entities, at least in the HTML-Kit implementation of it. 
That is why I thought it might be a standardization issue.
