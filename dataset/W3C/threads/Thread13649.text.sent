My Checkpoint Checker http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm 
now links to the ER tools list. 
I have also separate links to items within that list (at least Bobby) and would like feedback on what choices from the list might be appropriate, if any. 
The idea is to "filter" some of the tools as direct links from the Checker. 
If the WAVE has an icon that would work nicely. 
Also if you have any "pet" Webliographic materials I would like the URIs for those as well. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hmmm. 
Now if we had links from each checkpoint to tools taht can be used for that checkpoint, and information about each tool that said what checkpoints it tests for, that would indeed be cool... @@action Charles - this can be added to the tools database we already have.

Right at the moment I am hopeful that this little table entry to the checkpoints can wag the dog so that when one links from a checkpoint number in Checker the resulting location's links aren't SO repetetive - if that doesn't happen I'll have to do all the links within Checker. 
That however precludes the virtues of contiguity/lostness of the sort that enables discoveries of unintended information acquisition. 
Love.
