<s> Hello Jonathan, 1. Provincie Utrecht: We worked hard with the province of Utrecht (Netherlands) and Cap Gemini on a menu structure and implementation that is operatable without a mouse and accessible.  </s>
<s> The menu can be found at: www.provincie-utrecht.nl  </s>
<s> You can tab through it, open submenu's etc.  </s>
<s> And it comes out fine in a Jaws, Supernova, the Webformator etc.  </s>
<s> The menu has a skip to content link that is automatically generated from database and in some cases a click is followed by the focus going to the content automatically.  </s>
<s> Because menuitems are mostly linearised by screenreaders, they added graphics in front of the menuitems saying if it is a menuitem or a submenuitem (in the alt-text).  </s>
<s> Thus using alt-text as a means to give extra navigational information to people who are blind.  </s>
<s> There is a lot more theory and practice implementation behind the scenes here but this should give an example.  </s>
<s> 2. Sneller Sneller is a racinggame for blind people that only uses sound.  </s>
<s> It was developed to work together with screenreaders.  </s>
<s> At the start of the program there is a soundmenu.  </s>
<s> Because of reactions to the use of a soundmenu by the many non-blind players of the game the students of the HKU-KMT that made the program together with Bartimeus Accessibility are now researching into the usability and accessibility of soundmenu-interfaces.  </s>
<s> The game is translated as i write this but is currently only available in Dutch and can be downloaded from: www.soundsupport.net.  </s>
<s> English version and research results will be available in june 2002.  </s>

<s> Hmm, thinking about this.  </s>
<s> Yes, the "standard links" (the alpahbetical navigation) is really annoying.  </s>
<s> One possibility would be the "skip navigation links" that 508 mandates, but there has to be a better way of saying it for your audience in particular.  </s>
<s> To "grey out inactive links" i think the best trick is to unlink them.  </s>
<s> Can you explain what you mean by 'reading on action'?  </s>

<s> read on action is: read on mouse over, read on tab or other action.  </s>
<s> I'll be looking into all this over the coming months, but really believe some good examples are needed,as I'm very unclear about what is possible.  </s>
<s> Why this is SO important is that many users have multiple impairments.  </s>

<s> See http://www.mencap.org.uk for a working example, although one where the user needs to click on a button to make a section speak.  </s>
<s> But applying this to SVG animation or HTML event triggers should be reasonably straightforward (although because HTML's event triggering system is messy in terms of accessibility it won't be beautiful...) I will try to find time next week to write a code example.  </s>
<s> One of the issues here is whether this should be done by the author or the browser - people who have talking browsers will have interference problems.  </s>
<s> It seems to me a smarter solution in the general case for someone to be given a browser like websound or homepage reader.  </s>
