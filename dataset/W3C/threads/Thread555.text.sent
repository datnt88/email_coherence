Consider: This gets tidied to: But: Gets tidied to: Is there any way to make Tidy treat spans around block-level elements the same way it treats small? 
I use the Jan 18, 2002 version of Tidy.

Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net hello I've a small problem with the warning tidy gives on improper doctypes: my document begins with: the warning from tidy is: HTML Tidy for Solaris (vers 1st April 2002 (no joke); built on Apr 8 2002, at 09:07:35) Parsing "TOOLS/index.html" 
line 1 column 1 - Warning: HTML DOCTYPE doesn't match content TOOLS/index.html: 
Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" TOOLS/index.html: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional 1 warning, 0 errors were found! 
It seems to me that the first line should be talking about 3.2! 
Is this for real or is it a misunderstanding of mine? 
Thanks for any comment Pierre Hanser This is a known bug and currently tracked in our bug database. 
We are on it :-) Thanks for your report.
