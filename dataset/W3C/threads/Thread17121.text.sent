I am trying to educate someone for whom I designed accessible web templates to produce clean and tidy code. 
However, he wishes to use multiple empty paragraphs with non-breaking spaces to mess up my nice style sheets with uneven spacing. 
My question is sort of related: if a screen reader comes across code like this: (horrible, isn't it?) -- will this cause annoyance to the reader, or just be ignored completely? 
If the latter, I shall have to bite my tongue and keep quiet, I guess.

Daniele I spend a lot of time checking out other people's code using JFW, but I almost always have my screen reader set to ignore puncuation in the first place (do you have any idea how many people just adore those cute li'l emoticons?? 
Or how many people use extraneous puncuation, like exclamation and question marks? 
I use to have a rant about it but then some of my friends would send me email with the words "exclaim excalim question question" written as text to confuse my screen reader, and myself...). 
Anyway, if I really want to check code I go over it character by character, and I think this is pretty much what most people using a screen reader would do. 
I'm always thrilled to find someone who writes elegant code, but these individuals are few and far between.

I marked up the strings you gave below and when the page was loaded with just those strings, it appeared as though there was noting coded into the page.
