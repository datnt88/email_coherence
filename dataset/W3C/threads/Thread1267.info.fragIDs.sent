<s> Charset name: SAMI-WS2 This is the name character set is know as in GNU libc.  </s>
<s> Published specifications: A specification is available in "Statskontoret, teknisk norm Nr 35:1" Annex B, published by "Statskontoret, Box 2280, SE-1003 17 Stockholm, Sweden".  </s>
<s> This document is available online from Contact address for further information: Gustav Foseid Forum for implementation of support for North Sami in free software Intended usage: SAMI-WS2 is developed as a single byte encoding for all characters used in the Sami languages, of which Northern Sami is the most widely used.  </s>
<s> It is developed for use in Microsoft Windows environments, but is also being incorporated in GNU libc.  </s>
<s> Today SAMI-WS2 is the most widely used encoding for Sami languages.  </s>
<s> Other available single byte encodings are ISO-8859-10, ISO-IR-209 and a character set developed for use in Macintosh envionments.  </s>
<s> SAMI-WS2 is Microsoft Windows Sami version 2. This charset is suitable for use in MIME text body parts.  </s>

<s> * Gustav Foseid  </s>
<s> I strongly support this registration.  </s>
<s> The Sami community in Norway (and probably also elsewhere in Scandinavia) is using this charset in web pages, and there is a real need for a recognized identifier for it.  </s>
<s> Currently, people generally use "windows-1252" as the encoding identifier, but if an identifier is adopted there is a real chance that this may change.  </s>
<s> Opera 5.5 will ship with support for this charset, and it would be very good if it could support a commonly agreed identifier right from the start.  </s>
<s> --Lars M.  </s>
<s> Apologies for losing track of this registration for several months.... could you please resubmit the registration with the information required by RFC 2278?  </s>
<s> I think the data is: - Use in MIME: YES - Intended use: LIMITED USE - Unicode mapping table: In reference Since the Statskontoret reference does not include any control characters, you might also want to include the information that this charset includes control charset number 1 (which has CR and LF in the right places).  </s>
<s> OK? Harald  </s>
