William Loughborough Jutta Treviranus Jan Richards Heather Swayne Marjolein Katsma Fred Barnett Mathais M. JT: What about assignments? 
HS, MK: Expected them to be put on minutes. 
JT: CMN has personal commitments. 
WL: Commenting on style issues. 
Example: using EM element with CLASS to make different kinds of EM. Ensure CLASSes are exposed. 
Lots of WCAG discussion. 
MK: Just use XML. 
Esnure CLASS names are meaningful. 
JT: CLASS can be used to denote categorization. 
WL: Vast majority of people do not understnad separation of content from presentation. 
Wrote a little piece to explain. 
JT: Do you have an evaluation test? 
WL: Yes its in the records. 
WL: Additional comment: possible to make MyPic in XML without ALT. 
JT: Does JR have comment? 
JR: Blah, blah JT: How do people like the approach? 
ALL: Yes JT: Likes the division into Priorities. 
JT: Might make sense to have different kinds of tools besides markup editor/image editor MK: Maybe add image map JR: ACTION ITEM: Add image map WL: Do we have a comprehensive list of authoring tool functionailites. 
JT: No, we have some stuff in intro, etc. JT: Fred? 
FB: Tool just needs to be able to use CSS for formating. 
Nest lists properly and not use tables. 
WL: What about plain and simple language. 
WL: If tool has built in FOG index etc. it should have a higher rating. 
JT: Then a question to the evaluator should be asked. 
WL: ACTION ITEM: Do the questions for text. 
JT: CMN's form controls JT: We like P1,P2,P3, Like pass fail, Like approach of rorganizng be elements, like filtering by different types of tools. 
JT: More volunteers: MM: Working on multimedia. 
MK: ACTION ITEM: Will take lists HS: ACTION ITEM: Save as HTML functionality questions. 
Adjourned Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto Jan, thanks for the minutes. 
(I read them on my new WAP phone. 
makes for an interesting perspective - I haven't tried using it to author content yet, but hopefully I will be able to do that by te f2f in Bristol.) A couple more thoughts: It would be good to lok at the checkpoints and see which of them are sinple (i.e. there is one test to satisfy) and which are complex. 
For example, I think that 7.6 "Allow the Author to search within editing views" is simple - you just answer the question. 
4.1 (and the other relative priority checkpoints), and 5.1 (ensure everything is part of the look and feel) are complex - you need to test mutliple things. 
But 1.1 is in between. 
For example, if you can edit source, you meet 1.1. 
If you can't then you need to test for a number of different things that you can do in HTML, or whatevber type of content the tool produces (this might be easiest for image editors where there isn't much that can be done). 
What I am wondering is how we determine what needs to be tested for a given type of tool. 
Maybe by describing it and seeing if we agree.

Adjourned W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia I think it would be great if we could start every section with a couple of shortcut questions that allow the tester to skip big chunks if the right thing is present. 
Ex. "Can you edit source directly?" 
If yes skip to question X. Cheers, Jan
