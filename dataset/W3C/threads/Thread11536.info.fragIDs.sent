<s> To avoid any possible misunderstandings: translations for W3C are on a purely voluntary basis at present and not on a 'request' of W3C.  </s>
<s> This also mean that W3C cannot and does not determine the document that should be translated.  </s>
<s> This is usually decided based on the local interest/importance of a specific translation as well as the personal interest and experience of the translator.  </s>
<s> If you decide to translate a document, it is advisable to look at the translators' mailing list to see if the same document has already been worked on and, to avoid others to make the same mistake, announce your intention of translating a specific document.  </s>
<s> That is it.  </s>
<s> In other words: welcome in our family of translators!  </s>
