(Largely in agreement). 
The manifest file makes a lot of difference to this ... The manifest file should show the approved test cases only. 
Art: o Create a zip file (named latest.zip) 
at the top of the repo. 
This zip will be updated as new TCs are added. 
This zip may include TCs that have not yet been approved by the WG. Personally I would find latest.zip 
more useful if it did not include unapproved TCs. 
There is a maintenance issue here - is it realistic to update latest.zip on every change. 
As a test case user I would like to have a single URL that I go to to check conformance with the latest WG decisions. 
Obviously that can link to other URLs. 
Also a time lag is acceptable. 
Jeremy Speaking of the manifest stuff, it was on the Sep 28 agenda: 12: Discuss Test Manifest Strawman but it was never discussed and the minutes from that meeting: says: Discussion of moving test cases postponed since Jan Grant absent, awaiting proposal on manifest for test cases. 
However, it's not on the agenda for the Oct 12 meeting: Jan, Brian - what's up? 
o Create a zip file (named latest.zip)

This zip will be updated as new TCs are added. 
This zip may include TCs that have not yet been approved by the WG. 
I think it would be fine to have two zip's: latest_All.zip 
(everthing including those TCs not approved] and latest_Approved.zip 
(only Approved TCs). 
I don't think it's necessary to update the zip upon *every* change especially given the current rate of new test cases or the rate of approval. 
A couple of times/week should be fine (perhaps automated if I can determine how to run cron over AFS). 
I'm not following you here ... I've put it down for next week. 
Brian Art: Jan gave regrets for this week too. 
Jeremy: Art: Jeremy: Art: Jeremy: Art: Ideally in my ARP test package I would have a single well-known URL (e.g. the manifest file) that I go to. 
If everything works from there with no other hard coded w3c URLs then that's real cool. 
From a time point of view, publications delays are inevitable, and a couple of weeks is really no worse than a couple of hours.
