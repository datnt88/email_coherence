Frederick Allan Fay calls the Internet "the most empowering tool of my lifetime." 
One of the country's leading disability-rights activists, Mr. Fay, 54 years old, spends almost all of his time confined to a motorized bed.

(Which is half true and half not, in my opinion.) Will be adding this to the AWARE Center media tracking page soon.

"Principles of Aeronautics" Not sure, but this might be a useful example of how content can be adapted for 
audiences of different reading levels. 
Perhaps some of you can comment on how the graphics presentation is varied &amp; how helpful this example would be for your target populations.

Patrick, I enjoyed your website and it is well done and informative. 
I read the beginners, intermediate and instructor levels (history), and they each contain the basic information, with additional details added as the levels rise. 
In the next few days, I'll try to have some kids check it out and let you know if they were able to find their levels easily. 
The graphics that indicate the various levels aren't distinct, so children may have to guess to find their level, but the beginner's level is the first, so kids who cannot read the word "beginners" are likely to start there anyway. 
Maybe picture of different size/age people would help. 
A picture of a youngster for Beginners, a picture of a middle-schooler for Intermediate, a picture of a older teenager for advanced, and a picture of an adult/teacher for Instructor. 
The word "easy" could be used instead of "beginners". 
The site looks like a great beginning in solving the problems.

I could not get directly to this link (with IE nor Lynx) when I first tried. 
Navigator had no problems though! 
If you have trouble, try following the link for "Technology" from their home page. 
This is URL: And then scroll down to the "Technology and Society" group where "Internet offers freedom to disabled" is the first article. 
Even going this way, I could not get Lynx to bring up the article! 
Good luck with linking to this one Kynn!

Kynn, The suggestion of a stack of books, one book for lowest level, tall stack for highest level, in-betweens with less books, would be excellent. 
As you said, there currently is no clear graphic that would indicate literary/reading level, so there must be a start somewhere. 
If the graphic is intuitive enough, others will adopt it ... I also agree that the navigation symbols are easier to use at the bottom of the page rather than the top. 
As I read each page, I had to scroll back 
to the top to get to the button to go to the next page. 
Whatever button are used, I think they are easier to use if they say "previous" and "next" no matter the shape or color. 
This would follow the convention used in highway signs, e.g. STOP and YIELD, which are both unique shapes and colors, but have the word on them also. 
On the beginner's page, I also liked the addition of the sound link to read the page to the user. 
The voice is good, doesn't "talk down" to the user, and is much better than a synthesized voice doing the same text.

What about limited readers who are adults? 
This is similar to the reason why text-only version of a site shouldn't be labeled with a wheelchair or say "for disabled users" -- because not all disabled users want a text-only site, and not everyone who might be using non-graphical browsers is disabled. 
Likewise, I'd imagine that reading level can vary a LOT and not just by age (I read far above my age level all through school); so an age- based metaphor for the various levels doesn't seem appropriate. 
Perhaps instead you could use different heights/numbers of stacked books? 
There's no easy, universal way to indicate the concept of "literacy level" with a _simple_ graphic, but you may be able to get the concept across with something that visibly "increases." 
Right now, these images only differ by color, and that's not very useful. 
(They might as well be big round circles.) [When I say "you" I don't mean that Patrick or anyone else has access to change the pages, I'm just looking at this from a theoretical standpoint.] 
Under "beginners", some of the words seemed a bit "complex" to me and the graphics non-intuitive, such as the strange ball that represents "atmosphere". 
(I could understand it because I know what "atmosphere" means, but the image didn't help in my comprehension much.) 
Once I got into the site -- e.g. to read about "atmosphere" -- the content seemed understandable enough that I'd feel comfortable sending a child or limited reading adult to the site, except that the navigation features seem to be lacking. 
A lot of complex terms are introduced in the Table of Contents, with no graphical clues to meaning, but fortunately you can just click on "the next one" on the list without needing to understand it all. 
A graphical navigation button with directional arrows for forward and backwards at the bottom of the page would be nice, even for those of us who _can_ read. 
"Tape recorder" style icons are generally well-understood and I think whenever possible, graphics for "next" and "back" buttons need to look like arrows or triangles. 
(And should be placed at the END of content, not at the TOP, a problem I also had with the WCAG Curriculum slides.) Kynn Bartlett mailto:kynn@hwg.org

Agreed; symbols are easier to understand if they have both textual and "shape" meaning, and color meaning as well.
