<s> In general, you would be probably want something like add some more stuff next month/year - it is just a way to be "reasonably sure" that there aren't going to be big collisions in namespace 4 years away...)

<s> True that the month number doesn't appear there in most things.  </s>
<s> The difference for whether the year is there or not is (roughly) whether the thing started after sometime in 2001, or whether it came from an earlier period when URIs were assigned as word collections (which it is harder to assure will be usefully unique in a few years).  </s>
<s> I didn't mean namespace in the sense of "XML Namespaces" as defined in the spec (the things that start with "key:"), I meant the range of identifiers taht can be provided as URIs on the W3C site.  </s>
<s> I realise he doesn't mean a single document - the single documents would be things like http://www.w3.org/2002/spec-prod/some.xsl (As counter examples, consider the things that do not get into the A-Z list, which tend to have a month number - http://www.w3org/2001/03/earl or On the other hand, I think it would be better if someone with more direct responsibility gave this advice.  </s>
