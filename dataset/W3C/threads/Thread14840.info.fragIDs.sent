<s> This is essentially a re-post of a proposal which I submitted last week.  </s>
<s> I have however taken the opportunity to edit it slightly.  </s>
<s> Gregg and Wendy asked me to re-post these proposals for ease of future reference and to facilitate discussion.  </s>
<s> This is not a single proposal, but rather a set of related proposals.  </s>
<s> I first present the idea in its most complex form, then suggest various possible simplifications.  </s>
<s> am trying to transform various suggestions which have been raised on this mailing list, into specific proposals, the merits of which can then be debated more easily.  </s>
<s> General structure of the conformance scheme: Three conformance classes are proposed.  </s>
<s> A conformance claim can be made in respect of one, two or all three conformance classes, and must include: a. Identification of the web content (page, site, etc.) to which it pertains.  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> The version of the guidelines to which conformance is claimed.  </s>
<s> c.  </s>
<s> The date on which the conformance claim was made.  </s>
<s> Any method of expressing a conformance claim is acceptable so long as it includes all of the needed information and can be accessed (with or without suitable software tools, e.g., RDF processing applications) by users of the web site and/or search tools.  </s>
<s> To facilitate the making of conformance claims, the working group provides: 1.  </s>
<s> An RDF schema (that is, ERL, as defined by the ER and AU working groups).  </s>
<s> 2. An icon and associated text equivalent, which can serve as a link to a page that provides details of the conformance claim.  </s>
<s> Note: The RDF metadata and the web page which gives a textual exposition of the conformance claim, should be linked.  </s>
<s> Next come the definitions of the conformance classes.  </s>
<s> For each conformance class, the conformance claim must name the class and list the checkpoints which are claimed to have been met.  </s>
<s> This list must include all "essential" checkpoints in the particular class (see below); otherwise the conformance claim is invalid (this can be checked automatically).  </s>
<s> The checkpoints in each class are divided into two categories, "essential" and "recommended".  </s>
<s> These take the place of the WCAG 1.0 priority scheme.  </s>
<s> A checkpoint within a particular class is essential if failure to satisfy it will render the content inaccessible to identifiable groups of users whose needs are addressed by the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Conformance class 1, Device and modality independence: Essential: checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 4.1.  </s>
<s> Recommended: checkpoints 1.3, 1.4, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.  </s>
<s> Conformance class 2, Interaction and navigation: Essential: Checkpoints 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.  </s>
<s> Recommended: checkpoints 2.1 and 2.2.  </s>
<s> Note: It has sometimes been stated, though never demonstrated in detail, that every checkpoint under guideline 2 is "essential", in that failure to satisfy it will make the content inaccessible to an identifiable groups of users.  </s>
<s> If such an argument could be borne out, it would undermine the distinction proposed here between "essential" and "recommended" checkpoints, at least so far as guidelines 2 and 3 are concerned.  </s>
<s> Conformance class 3, Comprehension: Essential: checkpoints 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.  </s>
<s> Recommended: checkpoints 3.1 and 3.2.  </s>
<s> As noted above, the distinction between "essential" and "recommended" checkpoints, as it applies to guideline 3, may be problematic; but no one has so far proposed sustained arguments to demonstrate that every checkpoint under guideline 3 is inherently capable of making the crucial difference between accessibility (i.e., comprehension) and lack thereof, for an identifiable category of readers.  </s>
<s> Note: If some such conformance system were adopted, then I would recommend, by default or as an optional view, ordering the checkpoints under each guideline by listing the "essential" checkpoints first, followed by the "recommended" checkpoints.  </s>
<s> It would also be helpful to choose better terms than "essential" and "recommended" (the latter in particular may be confusing, given that the entire document is referred to as a W3C Recommendation; but "optional", or "inessential" or even "suggested" give the wrong impression.  </s>
<s> Recommended checkpoints are just that--very important but not so indispensable that failure to satisfy them renders the content absolutely inaccessible to identifiable groups).  </s>
<s> Possible simplifications: Here is a non-exhaustive list of variations on the above proposal: 1. Combine interaction/navigation and comprehension into a single class, thereby defining two conformance classes, viz., (1) device and modality independence; and (2) comprehension, interaction and navigation.  </s>
<s> 2. Drop the distinction between "essential" and "recommended", either completely, or in such a way as to retain it in the "device and modality-independence" class, where the issues seem to be more clear-cut.  </s>
<s> In the latter case, the notion of "essential/recommended" would be dropped and one would simply define the "device and modality independence" class as: All checkpoints in guidelines 1 and 4, but must include checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 4.1.  </s>
<s> 3. Drop the "conformance classes" as defined above, and simply require that a conformance claim list the checkpoints which have been met.  </s>
<s> This version of the conformance scheme could be implemented with or without the notion of "essential checkpoints" (see proposal 2, above).  </s>
<s> Note that the proposed distinction between "essential" and "recommended" checkpoints is, in effect, a two-tiered priority scheme, which may be contrasted with the three-tiered system defined in WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of such a scheme in the above proposal may be supported on the following grounds: 1. Simplicity. 2. Given the division of the guidelines in to (two or three) conformance classes, a two-level priority system seems sufficient, especially in view of the relatively small number of checkpoints in each class.  </s>
<s> 3. Given the greater generality of the checkpoints in WCAG 2.0 by comparison with those of WCAG 1.0, it is harder to make fine-grained priority decisions (that is, to classify the checkpoints according to a three-level hierarchy).  </s>
<s> The two-level hierarchy makes prioritisation easier in this respect.  </s>
<s> Using EARL it is already possible to assert that a document conforms to some specified checkpoints in WCAG.  </s>
<s> So enabling this does not require anything of the working group except that the checkpoints are identifiable by individual URI's (i.e. no decision required).  </s>
<s> The working group could elect to support claims for conformance on this basis but it is then hard to see what the value is - instead of having a recommendation standard document which is a specification we will be producing some good ideas which I do not think it will be possible for W3C to issue as a Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Ways of using information claiming conformance to various checkpoints have been discussed before WCAG 1.0 was released (and this was proposed at the time).  </s>
<s> Since it is now possible to produce and manipulate this information I don't think there is a lot to discuss.  </s>
<s> I therefore propose that the working group resolve that the suggestion that conformance claims are just a list of checkpoints met is not regarded as a definition of conformance - either we have some other scheme, or we do not define confomance to WCAG 2. cheers Charles [snip] This is not a single proposal, but rather a set of related proposals.  </s>

<s> This version of the conformance scheme could be implemented with or without the notion of "essential checkpoints" (see proposal 2, above).  </s>
<s> If this proposal is to be defensible then it must be possible to identify who gains and who is not supported by each possible combination.  </s>
<s> It also concerns me that there is a division of conformance based on serving different groups of people - in other words that it is possible that it will be possible to claim "WAI conformance" for a document that is comprehensible to almost anyone but relies on images, sounds, and movies to get a message across, without providing any kind of textual equivalent.  </s>
<s> (There are other possible combinations which would lead to paralell situations - this is just one example)  </s>

<s> Yes, but it would be argued on the other side that such a conformance claim is an accurate description of what the content developer has done (i.e., in Charles' example, the implementor has satisfied the needs related to comprehension but not those of device-independence, with the result that the content will be very accessible to some people and completely inaccessible to others).  </s>
<s> If the purpose of the conformance scheme is to enable developers to make assertions, accurately and verifiably, regarding which checkpoints, and therefore which needs, have been met, then such a consequence is unobjectionable.  </s>
<s> However, if the purpose of the guidelines is to set a policy (for example that the content must satisfy all three dimensions--device and modality-independence, interaction/navigation, and comprehension requirements--at some level before any conformance claim of any kind can be made, thereby imposing, in effect, a policy on developers), then Charles' concern becomes a valid objection to the kind of proposal that I have outlined.  </s>
<s> One of Kynn's criticisms of the WCAG 1.0 conformance scheme, as I understand his argument, is that it is overly prescriptive in the way in which it sets priorities and requires developers to privilege some needs over others.  </s>
<s> The concept of a multi-dimensional conformance scheme is intended to avoid this shortcoming.  </s>
<s> Effectively the question which Charles raises, and it is one that I have had occasion to consider as well, is whether it should be permissible to assert that web content is accessible along some dimensions and not others, or whether some degree of accessibility along every dimension should be a prerequisite to the making of a conformance claim.  </s>
<s> This very much depends upon how one regards the role and purpose of the conformance scheme and the guidelines as a whole.  </s>
<s> Is the purpose of the conformance scheme to allow unambiguous statements regarding what has been accomplished, or to mandate that the needs of certain groups must be met before any conformance claim of any kind is permitted, thereby establishing a de facto implementation policy?  </s>
<s> If all we are doing is enabling developers to state which checkpoints they meet, then we have nothing to do and need not write anything about conformance to the document as a whole (I already argued this in another sub-thread).  </s>
<s> I agree that this document should not be attempting to describe policy setting priorities.  </s>
<s> The existing scheme attempts to explain how important various checkpoints are to users, without differentiating users into different groups.  </s>
<s> I think there are two important parts of that.  </s>
<s> One is that it doesn't say anything about which type of people is more or less important.  </s>
<s> In the real world of implementations being developed with associated cost, someone may have to make such decisions.  </s>
<s> But we don't have any authority that I can imagine for doing so, since in the abstract it is merely an arbitrary decision based on factors related entirely to individual situations.  </s>
<s> The other is that it isn't based on how easy something is, but how important it is - what does it mean to users.  </s>
<s> I believe that there is plenty of value in the statement that we should critically re-examine the particular priorities we have assigned, as well as the checkpoints we have assigned them to.  </s>
<s> I am much less convinced that the idea behind the current scheme is flawed in ways that the various new proposals would resolve.  </s>
<s> The one really sound argument I have seen is that people may not attempt to meet WCAG at any level except those of particular conformance levels, and that therefore people will not d othings that are valuable and easy because they aren't contributing to achieving a particular target level.  </s>
<s> This seems a very foolish approach to accessibility, and we may be able to help.  </s>
<s> It should be clear from the existing WCAG that every checkpoint is helpful to people, and meeting any checkpointis a good thing.  </s>
<s> It should also be clear that conformance levels represent basic minima rather than ultimate goals.  </s>
<s> The ultimate goal is universal accessibility regardless of disability, and getting to triple-A is at least a good step alolng that path, although it may be insufficient.  </s>
<s> Settling for less is in any case a compromise between reaching the goal and saving development effort for something else.  </s>
<s> But that's what happens in the real world, so we need to acknowledge it.  </s>
<s> The goal is that this works for the people who read Web content.  </s>
<s> A minor objection is that the proposal for functionality classes fails to identify who wins and loses in each combination.  </s>
<s> A major objection is that this approach seems to me fundamentally counter-productive when reaching for our ultimate goal of universal accessibility, by making arbitrary divisions of people.  </s>

<s> Reply: Perhaps it should be clear, but (IMO) it isn't clear at all that every checkpoint is helpful.  </s>
<s> Even this presumes that readers of the document give a damn about helping people.  </s>
<s> The problem with little conformance icons is that many web developers will shoot for the icon simply so they can post it on their sites.  </s>
<s> They don't really care at all about who is being helped.  </s>
<s> They care about their own images.  </s>
<s> Suppose we create a conformance scheme similar to the one used by WCAG 1.  </s>
<s> Many developers will look at the three levels of conformance, assess at which point conformance becomes difficult for them, and then select the next lowest level of conformance.  </s>
<s> In other words, if there is a checkpoint required for AA conformance that seems too difficult, they will choose to meet A only.  </s>
<s> And since there is no benefit to them (no change in icon) to meet ANY of the AA checkpoints, they won't bother.  </s>
<s> So such a system encourages many developers to conform in discrete chunks.  </s>
<s> Of course, many other developers will simply slap an icon on their sites without making any effort at all to conform to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> After all, who is charged with enforcement?  </s>
<s> What penalty do they risk?  </s>
<s> I think that we should rethink the entire idea of conformance.  </s>
<s> Conformance is for regulations.  </s>
<s> We are not a regulatory body.  </s>
<s> We should not be making regulations.  </s>
<s> And to prevent our guidelines from being used as the basis for regulations, we should make it very clear by their content and structure that they are wholly unsuitable for regulations.  </s>
<s> In other words, we should make them guidelines.  </s>
<s> We should leave the task of beating people into making their sites accessible to government.  </s>
<s> That is government's job.  </s>
<s> Instead, we should begin with the assumption that all of our readers are truly interested in making their sites as accessible as possible, and we should give them the *guidance* they need to accomplish this.  </s>
<s> Guidelines and regulations are very different.  </s>
<s> They have different intent, different content, and a very different structure.  </s>
<s> By trying to achieve a little of both, we will end up doing neither.  </s>
<s> This, to me, is the real issue confronting this group, and until we meet it head on, we are unlikely to produce anything resembling a finished product.  </s>
