I've been messaging the kind folks over at Henter-Joyce since a problem with "missing content" on a web page appeared a week ago. 
Appearently, JAWS VPC discards content between SPAN tags; the problem's been reported with IE 5.5 plus Jaws 3.7, if I recall correctly, but not with IE 5.0. 
An example is available at http://holstius.com/span_tags.html . 
Code in question looks something like: span class="X" label for="MyField" Some text: /label /span input 
where I was using a rule: .X 
{ width: 12em; text-align: right; } 
to make the form's input fields align nicely with their labels without resorting to a TABLE. 
(Just wanted to see if it worked.) Could have just set the class on the LABEL tag, yes, but still this is syntactically valid. 
I 
got a reply from an HJ representative: 
Currently Jaws VPC does not support these tags and therefore Jaws is prevented from seeing the associated web form field labels. 
The temporary solution is to remove the surrounding span tags from the field labels. 
So this web page is using a web tag in which Jaws did not anticipate when attempting to grab the label for the fields. 
You are correct in that the web page adheres to W3 standards but Jaws simply never has known about this tag. 
I have put this into the database as record 5642 as a suggestion for support. 
Workable, yes, but does anyone want to see content they've put between SPANs (in many cases, put there to avoid deprecated or improper markup) rendered 
inaudible for users of JAWS and IE 5.5??? 
I urged this representative to put this high on his priority list of fixable bugs. 
If you visit the above page ( http://holstius.com/span_tags.html ) and don't hear anything like "Author", "Title", "Publisher", etc. before the form fields, there's a problem. 
Thanks to anyone who takes the time to check this out. 
JAWS users, you may especially wish to ask HJ about this.

indeed, jaws 3.7 with ie5.5 with forms mode turned on as you tab from field to field does not announce the field labels. 
however, this is common on many pages and our work around when we use jfw as extensively as we do in filling forms is to use the vertical arrow keys to traverse the page till we come to a controll or field we wish to act on and turn on forms mode, act on the controll/field and then turn off forms mode to get to the next desired controll or field. the work around that you were given is good if you want to mark up the form so that jfw tracks the labels while in forms mode. 
even with forms mode turned off, tabbing yeilds only the word edit as you tab through the boxes. 
This is why I caution against coding for a particular screen reader and why I also caution those who wish to target screen readers to make sure that there is a well grounded user available or that they are a well grounded user. 
see the rendering below for the effect of my description. 
Thanks!

You are relying on a bug in IE. width is not a defined attribute for inline elements. 
(I had a bug report on Mozilla rejected because I made this mistake!) 
Currently Jaws VPC does not support these tags and therefore Jaws is prevented from seeing the associated web form field labels. 
The temporary solution is to remove the surrounding 
Unsupported *tags* should be ignored. 
Unsupported *elements* should not be ignored but treated as though they had no surrounding open and closing tags. 
This is a basic rule of HTML and a rather easy one to implement! 
They normally are there to allow the HTML to validate against more recent DTDs without the user actually having to think, or the authoring tool to have to change its user interface from one designed to insert 
FONT FACE=". 
In particular, this example should have been. 
label for="MyField" class="X" Some text: /label input And, in most cases, the styling should be applied to a STRONG, EM, or Hn element, not to SPAN. 
David/Michael, Are you saying that JAWS ignores the text you had as "some text:" in your example, or that JAWS does not recognize the fact that you have specified "some text:" as the LABEL for the INPUT? 
The answer from Freedom Scientific seems to have these two issues mixed up as well. 
I would be very surprised if the first is the problem. 
There is an explanation it yours is the second issue. 
Your code is wrong. 
It isn't just your example below either; the error is on the referenced page (http://holstius.com/span_tags.html). 
The value of the for attribute in the LABEL element must be the id of the corresponding form element, not the name. 
form elements should really do the job.

it is the second problem we face. 
Thanks for the tip. 
I'll be interested in what the change results in.

The page now validates as XHTML and the LABEL tags now reference the "id" attribute of the INPUT tags. 
Thanks to David Wooley for catching this. 
I'd originally thought the page validated, but it was part of a site that required a login, and when the validator tried to parse this page, it was kicked out to the login and thus actually validated the *login* page. 
Whoops. 
Re: Netscape performance. 
This page was part of a demo project I was presenting to an IE audience. 
The project is on hold and won't be public for some time. 
I haven't tested in in NS6/Mozilla yet. 
Typically, for a public version, I'd install a sniffer of some sort and feed different stylesheets to CSS-compatible browsers than to (shudder) NS 4.x. 
I use a "positive-id" scheme, i.e. I'll take the base page, add whatever valid CSS I know won't break in NS4, and feed that as default to all browsers. 
Then (using server-side if available, otherwise some JS) I additionally feed the rest of the CSS I want to use, but ONLY for those browsers I have managed to personally test it on, before the page goes out the door. 
So untested browsers just get the base level CSS, but sometimes I do add a third stylesheet for NS4. 
Re: Accesskeys. 
Again, the page was for a known audience, but I know now that those accesskeys in the form will interfere with (at least) IBM Home Page Reader's defaults, thanks to Jim Thatcher. 
I agree; using this many accesskeys is probably not a good idea but I wanted to emphasize the concept to my demo audience. 
Cheers, David Holstius 
David, I hope you viewed my "criticisms" as suggestions to make your form even better. 
It is an absolutely terrific example. 
I am especially impressed with your repositioning of the navigation links. 
Without looking at it with a talking browser or screen reader, AND, viewing the page, you may have no idea how special your page is. 
Terrific. 
Looking forward to hearing how Netscape 6 handles it. 
The access key conflicts are really bad with Home Page Reader, but they certainly exist even with native IE. Jim jim@jimthatcher.com
