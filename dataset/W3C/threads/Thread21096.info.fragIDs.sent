<s> I have had a regular problem with Amaya 8.0 - perhaps someone can have a look?  </s>
<s> Imagine a page where the markup ends up like this: If I try to hit a carriage return between the H2s, either in source view or the regular view, Amaya crashes.  </s>
<s> I have had other crashes, but this is the one I can most easily repeat.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your attention to this!  </s>
