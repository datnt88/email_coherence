Isn't the following text from the current XML spec a "normative reference": "By definition, valid XML documents are conformant SGML documents in the sense described in ISO standard 8879."

I don't think so. 
That would be true only for an instance. 
It says nothing about the schemata. 
That is probably the point.

A document is composed of an instance and a DTD. 
For the document to conform to SGML, both must conform to SGML. 
Paul Prescod 
That is interesting but if it were the case, why would anyone have problems with a clear normative reference? 
This looks like a legalistic approach that doesn't adequately express the intent. 
The problem is in the definition of "the document". 
It's a fascinating problem. 
By comparison to the way this has been worked out by the VRML Consortium, one could infer the W3C behavior is mercurial. 
Let's see how the ERB works it out. 
But without a normative reference, and given the weak position of the W3C with respect to member conformance, I'd say XML has less than half the same chance HTML had of remaining a stable standard. 
For a long lifecycle format, that is a failure for this process and unfortunately for this membership, the acid test of whether it is worth moving to XML from SGML except for trivial information. 
Without the safeguards which only conformance guarantees, it isn't worth the expense.

Yes, that certainly looks like a normative reference to me. 
But the handling of references in the xml spec[1] is non-traditional: there's a touchy-feely "relationship to existing standards" section and section called "references" which is really a bibliography, but no a list of normative references. 
So the current draft[1] seems unclear on whether the reference to the SGML spec is normative.

I believe it's incorrect to say "By definition" in this text. 
It's by design that valid XML documents are conformant, and (who knows? 
could it be?) we might just possibly have made a teeny tiny mistake that makes them nonconformant (which we'll fix immediately, of course!). 
This weekend, I made a comment to the editors suggesting that they swap "definition" for "design"; it would be more correct in fact and in spirit.
