<s> Isn't the following text from the current XML spec a "normative reference": "By definition, valid XML documents are conformant SGML documents in the sense described in ISO standard 8879."  </s>

<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> That would be true only for an instance.  </s>
<s> It says nothing about the schemata.  </s>
<s> That is probably the point.  </s>

<s> A document is composed of an instance and a DTD.  </s>
<s> For the document to conform to SGML, both must conform to SGML.  </s>

<s> That is interesting but if it were the case, why would anyone have problems with a clear normative reference?  </s>
<s> This looks like a legalistic approach that doesn't adequately express the intent.  </s>
<s> The problem is in the definition of "the document".  </s>
<s> It's a fascinating problem.  </s>
<s> By comparison to the way this has been worked out by the VRML Consortium, one could infer the W3C behavior is mercurial.  </s>
<s> Let's see how the ERB works it out.  </s>
<s> But without a normative reference, and given the weak position of the W3C with respect to member conformance, I'd say XML has less than half the same chance HTML had of remaining a stable standard.  </s>
<s> For a long lifecycle format, that is a failure for this process and unfortunately for this membership, the acid test of whether it is worth moving to XML from SGML except for trivial information.  </s>
<s> Without the safeguards which only conformance guarantees, it isn't worth the expense.  </s>
<s> len  </s>
<s> Yes, that certainly looks like a normative reference to me.  </s>
<s> But the handling of references in the xml spec[1] is non-traditional: there's a touchy-feely "relationship to existing standards" section and section called "references" which is really a bibliography, but no a list of normative references.  </s>
<s> So the current draft[1] seems unclear on whether the reference to the SGML spec is normative.  </s>

<s> I believe it's incorrect to say "By definition" in this text.  </s>
<s> It's by design that valid XML documents are conformant, and (who knows?  </s>
<s> could it be?) we might just possibly have made a teeny tiny mistake that makes them nonconformant (which we'll fix immediately, of course!).  </s>
<s> This weekend, I made a comment to the editors suggesting that they swap "definition" for "design"; it would be more correct in fact and in spirit.  </s>
