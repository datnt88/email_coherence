<s> Hello! The ability to annotate any WWW resource is wonderfull, but I have a question (possibly a FAQ): Is there a way to search for all web pages, which match certain conditions AND have annotations [on a set of annotation servers that this search engine accesses]?  </s>
<s> I.e. something like Google, but with a flag in advance search "Is annotated".  </s>
<s> While the amount of annotated pages is small compared with the total amount of the information on Web, I would very much prefer to be able to filter out pages that are annotated as opposed to look at all pages and see if they have annotations.  </s>
<s> P.S. The same question in broader scope would be: is there a search engine [like Google] to find all resources with RDF metainformation that matches selected criteria (i.e. describes object Person from a certain schema, etc.)?  </s>
<s> Best regards, Uldis mailto:captsolo@pop3.pid.gov.lv  </s>
<s> Hello, 1- if you have a list of annotation servers and you know their protocol, you can get the list of annotations 2- if annotations are stored and published in a specific file format (you thought about RDF-XML), then a search engine could crawl the Web to find them: Google does that with PDF documents and Cora is a search engine to find research papers.  </s>
<s> 3- if annotations are embedded into Web pages (for example an annotation would contain an XPointer), then you would have to crawl the Web and get only those XPointers.  </s>
<s> Search engines could easily do that.  </s>
<s> I personnaly like the 3rd solution: it lets users embed annotations in their current web pages: annotations do not have to be stored on a server or in a separate annotation file.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, you could send search engines the URL of your Web pagse  </s>
<s> containing annotations so they can directly process and include them into their database...  </s>
<s> I wrote a small proposal a few years ago about using extended URLs to encode an annotation (see .pdf)  </s>
<s> The idea was quite similar to what was also proposed later by Phelps and Wilensky for robust hyperlinks (see http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/papers/RobustHyperlinks.html)  </s>
<s> I can see uses of requesting annotations left by people on a specific text in a Web page (like a book you are about the buy on Amazon.com).  </s>
<s> What were you motivations?  </s>
<s> Do you have usage scenarios in mind?  </s>
<s> Laurent.  </s>
<s> Strange, the ability to create an annotation which can be associated with a page without having to be embedded or linked has always struck me as the key benefit of Annotea etc. Cheers, Danny.  </s>
<s> Danny, I'm not suggested to embed the annotation in the ORIGINAL document!  </s>
<s> I'm only suggesting to embed annotations within existing web page.  </s>
<s> The first step to do this would be that annotation servers give you a URL for each annotation, so you might safely embed it into your Web pages like this: a href="http://annotea.w3c.org/?command=get_annotation&amp;id=1254wssdf"  </s>
<s> my annotation /a Of course, this means that: - everyone has access to an annotation server to create new annotations - everyone trusts the web server (the server knows what you annotate) - people accessing your annotations need to access the server, so they ALSO need to trust the server - the server needs to be running So I was suggesting the second way: using "extended URLs" to encode the annotation itself: - the document it annotates (url) - the anchor point in this document - possibly the date, author, comment a href="http://www.w3c.org?anchor=word1+word2+...&amp;author=denoue&amp;comment=good+t hing" my comment /a To create such standalone annotations, you don't need an annotation server.  </s>
<s> Everyone can create its own annotations and embed them in their web pages.  </s>
<s> It's like creating a hyperlink: would you like to have to use a third-party server every time you needed to link to a particular page?  </s>
<s> Same thing with annotations...  </s>
<s> The third step then is to have a search engine (like today's annotation server) which crawls the web and identifies annotations, make them searchable, ... like annotea does today.  </s>
<s> But I think we missed the first two steps!  </s>
<s> Laurent.  </s>
