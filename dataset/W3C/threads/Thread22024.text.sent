How should I organize files in dom l3 ls tests ? 
currently I got ...../tests/level3/ls/ for the test files ...../tests/level3/ls/files for input test files ...../tests/level3/ls/output for serialized output jeroen X-Hive Corporation Jeroen van Rotterdam, CEO e-mail: jeroen@x-hive.com 
Do you mean in the CVS or once they are built? 
The input files are read by the parser and need to be stored in cvs. 
The output files are temporary. 
I need a scratch directory for round-trip tests which can be easily resolved to a relative url.

That could make things interesting. 
In the existing java tests, relative URL are resolved in reference to jar: URL. 
You would not have write access to the test .jar 
file. 
In the browser based tests, you may not have access to the file system. 
Might have to add a framework function that will give you a URL to a writable temporary file. 
Will probably have to look at some proposed tests and figure out how to deal with the situation.
