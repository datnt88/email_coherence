Hi folks, I have updated the instructions for installing Amaya on OS X [1] - thanks to Carine Bournez and Damian Steer (and the fink project) who have done a lot of work to make it work. 
(I also added a smaller screenshot of version 7.1 running on OroborosX). 
I suggest that the link on the Amaya home page point to that, rather than the listing in the fink database which isn't actually a very helpful place to find out how to install Amaya. 
The latest version provides instruction for installing a binary package (the easiest way, but currently only gives version 6.1) or compiling version 7.1 with fink (still pretty easy) or by yourself (for people who like a challenge or want to try the internationalised version). 
If people have used fink to install version 7.1, please provide feedback to the maintainer (fink info amaya will tell you where to send it) so that it gets into the stable tree and a binary becomes available (or so problems can be identified and resolved).

Chaals, just to thank you for that, I must have been really tired, but hadn't really gathered that this was a debian type thing, or that CVS would be OK. hope it doesn't all go pear shaped Jonathan On Thursday, January 30, 2003, at 08:32 AM, Charles McCathieNevile Thanks to Jonathan pointing out a couple of problems - I have updated the document again.
