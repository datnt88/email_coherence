<s> Hello, Deleting Guideline 9 may sound like a radical proposal, but I don't think it is.  </s>
<s> Here's the idea: In the 29 September Guidelines, the Guideline reads "Alert the user of content and viewport changes."  </s>
<s> However, the checkpoints under Guideline 9 are not about notification.  </s>
<s> The three Guideline 9 checkpoints are: 9.1 Ensure that when the selection or content focus changes, it is in a viewport after the change.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint could easily go alongside checkpoints 4.18 and 4.19, which are about viewports opening and focus changes.  </s>
<s> 9.2 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit activation of a form submit control.  </s>
<s> 9.3 Indicate the relative position of the viewport in rendered content (e.g., the proportion of an audio or video clip that has been played, the proportion of a Web page that has been viewed, etc.).  </s>
<s> These checkpoints could easily go in Guideline 8 (Orientation).  </s>
<s> Thus, I think that since none of the checkpoints in Guideline 9 are really about notification, we should delete the Guideline and redistribute the checkpoints appropriately.  </s>
<s> Where did the "notification" checkpoints go?  </s>
<s> In the 5 November 1999 draft (the "first" last call draft smile ), Guideline 9 included six checkpoints.  </s>
<s> The additional checkpoints were: 9.1 Provide information about user agent-initiated content and viewport changes directly to the user and through APIs.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 9.4 Allow the user to configure notification preferences for common types of content and viewport changes.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] 9.5 When loading content (e.g., document, video clip, audio clip, etc.) indicate what portion of the content has loaded and whether loading has stalled.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Working backwards, here's where they went: 1) Checkpoint 9.5 ("stalled" loading).  </s>
<s> At the 10 August 2000 teleconf [3], the WG resolved to delete this checkpoint since it could not identify any requirement specific to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Notification of loading status is important to everyone and the UA must present that information in accessible manner (covered by checkpoint 1.5).  </s>
<s> 2) Checkpoint 9.4 (configuration of notification preferences).  </s>
<s> This checkpoint is a configuration checkpoint for 9.1, so when 9.1 was deleted 9.4 was also deleted.  </s>
<s> Refer to the resolution to delete at the 31 August teleconference [4].  </s>
<s> 3) Checkpoint 9.1 (information about changes).  </s>
<s> We resolved to delete this checkpoint at the 20 January 2000 teleconference [5] as a result of review during the first last call.  </s>
<s> We also raised the priority of the checkpoint requiring user control of changes (now checkpoint 3.7).  </s>
<s> For more background, refer to issue 142 [6].  </s>
<s> Thanks, - Ian P.S. I'm making this proposal in order to help ensure that each checkpoint fits under a Guideline appropriately.  </s>
<s> I would note, however, that if we delete Guideline 9, we also have the attractive result of ten Guidelines...
