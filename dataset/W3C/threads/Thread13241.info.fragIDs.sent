<s> we're due for a face 2 face meeting.  </s>
<s> we need to give 8 weeks notice before a face to face so that people can make travel plans.  </s>
<s> could we have suggestions by next wednesday (12 January) for: 1. a city.  </s>
<s> chicago is central, but i'm not sure who we could work with to host the meeting.  </s>
<s> Several members of the group are on the East coast, so someplace like Boston might be more feasible.  </s>
<s> Again, I'm not sure who would host, perhaps MIT/W3C?  </s>
<s> I would love to see a meeting in Madison, but I imagine that is wishful thinking; there are no direct flights (Except from chicago, minneapolis and milwaukee) and those adverse to cold may not appreciate the mounds of snow.  </s>
<s> Plus, I'm not sure who could host it (my house isn't quite large enough).  </s>
<s> 2. a venue.  </s>
<s> 3. dates. the earliest that we could schedule a meeting, assuming that we wrap up discussion and announce by next Thursday 13 January, is March 9. note that CSUN is the week of March 20th.  </s>
<s> We can not schedule a meeting immediately after CSUN because other WAI groups have beat us to it.  </s>
<s> We usually don't schedule WAI meetings before CSUN because then it becomes a full week of meetings (csun + WAI meetings afterwards).  </s>
<s> The WAI team discussed possibilities last Tuesday and suggested April.  </s>
<s> Charles will be in Boston in April. is there another conference that we could piggyback off of? 4. how many days do you suppose we need?  </s>
<s> one or two? 5. Agenda items.  </s>
<s> I assume the agenda would be (at the minimum) the following issues: 1. ERT document.  </s>
<s> 2. WART. 3. rechartering and future plans (our charters expired last July).  </s>

<s> Thanks, Wendy.  </s>
<s> For venue, we can consider Phildelphia.  </s>
<s> I believe can get the Institute on Disabilities/UAP to host and Temple has some spiffy meeting areas in our new learning center.  </s>
<s> Philadelphia has a major Airport in town, and there's another, even bigger airport in Newark NJ (A much longer drive, but gives more options for other fares).  </s>
<s> It isn't in the center of the US, but it's more centered with respect to Europe smile .  </s>
<s> For length... I'd suggest a total of two days, but arranged so that the second is optional.  </s>
<s> The first day would an "interest group" focus with a wide range of discussins.  </s>
<s> The second day we'd have a "working group" focus: We'd nail down specifics on our work items.  </s>
<s> All would be invited but it woudn't be a requirement.  </s>
<s> Len p.s. (by "host" I mean supplying meeting facilities.)  </s>
<s> Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Department of Electrical Engineering Temple University 423 Ritter Annex, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org  </s>

<s> Hi - If we choose Boston, CAST can host.  </s>
<s> We have a meeting space for about 20 people (or more if we sqeeze), with a projector, PC/Mac computer, etc.  </s>
<s> The only catch is that Wednesdays it is in use, so it would have to be Mon-Tue or Thur-Fri.  </s>
<s> CAST is 20 miles outside of Boston, though, so that may not be as attractive to some people (we might consider renting a bus from Boston so people can stay where the action is).  </s>
<s> CSUN and WWW9 are the big conferences on my calendar, as far as scheduling around or piggybacking on.  </s>
<s> What I would like to see on the agenda, among whatever else others want, is a half or full day of WG-style work on the ERT doc.  </s>
<s> Perhaps if we do an IG day and a WG day, the WG day could split into a few different tracks with different sub-WGs.  </s>
<s> I don't know if people's goals are mutually exclusive enough to permit this but it would enable us to put more focus into each project.  </s>
