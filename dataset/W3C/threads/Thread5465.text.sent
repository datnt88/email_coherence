This is in response to a request for comments on "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" Working Draft 9 December 2003 http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/ . 
The document could be split into a smaller one which just describes the architecture and a larger one which gives the explanation and justification. 
The language used could be simplified up to make the document shorter and easier to understand. 
For example it is not necessary to refer to "this travel scenario" within the example used, as the reader will see that from the context. 
There is no reason to detail more than once that a request will return a "representation of the resource". 
Much of the justification for the architecture in the document is difficult to understand on its own. 
It appears to be a byproduct of an internal W3C debate over where the web should go. 
It would be better if that debate happened outside the standards-type document. 
However, the real test of such a document is how useful it is in practice. 
As an example in 2003 I taught students at the Australian National University how to design iMode web pages http://www.tomw.net.au/2004/wd.html#L1198 . 
In 2004 I was thinking of showing them how to do XHTML-MP web pages. 
Will the "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" help decide if XHTML-MP is a useful technology? 
Will it help in designing better wireless web technology?

Please stand by for a reply in substance. 
I hope it won't take more than a few more weeks. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003? 
Thank you for your comment: on the TAG's "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" Working Draft 9 December 2003. 
The TAG discussed your comment at a recent meeting and I am answering on behalf of the TAG. 
The TAG has worked hard to find the correct balance on how large the "Architecture of the World Wide Web" WD should be. 
This WD and several previous versions have followed the principle that the document should not be just a point-form architecture specification but that it should contain sufficient motivating examples that the reader has no trouble understanding the rational for the architectural principals in the document. 
The TAG has been very careful to NOT include all the text from its various Findings that are referenced by the WD. 
In fact the TAG has followed the practice of effectively writing a pr?cis of any Finding and then including only that shorter write up in the WD. 
In summary the TAG continues to feel that it has found the correct balance on the material that is in the WD versus that which is in the Findings. 
As such we are not going to change the document as you have requested. 
Please let us know if you are satisfied by this response to the issue that you raised. 
/paulc Paul Cotton, Microsoft Canada 17 Eleanor Drive, Nepean, Ontario K2E 6A3 Thanks, I am satisfied that you have given my comment serious consideration. 
But as is I don't see the document as being workable, so I will not be recommending use of the Architecture to my students, colleagues or clients.
