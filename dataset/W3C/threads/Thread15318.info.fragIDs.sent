<s> Hello, Michael incorporated the resolutions from Thursday's telecon [1] into the latest draft of the "Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Checklists and Techniques" [2].  </s>
<s> Please review this draft before Wednesday (22 January) and send any major issues to the list ASAP.  </s>
<s> We are hopeful that at next Thursday's telecon (23 January), the Working Group will approve publication of the requirements to the W3C Technical Reports (TR) page [3].  </s>
<s> If the Working Group gives its approval, we hope to publish to TR on Friday (24 January).  </s>

<s> Hi Jason, I agree with your edits on the 4.1 items I also agree with your first suggestion on the Review Requirements.  </s>
<s> (i.e. "derived from the same XML Document") For the second suggestion though that deals with removing "technology specific" from "technology specific checklist item" I have two concerns.  </s>
<s> 1) just saying "checklist item" is too close to "checkpoint".  </s>
<s> I think there will be great and frequent confusion.  </s>
<s> 2) I don't think we will have "core" checklists.  </s>
<s> If they apply to all technologies, then I think they should be appended (or prepended) to the technology specific list -- OR people will just do the technology specific and forget the core.  </s>
<s> Also, if there is no technology specific list, people may do ONLY the core.  </s>
<s> I think that ALL the Success Criteria need to be treated in each Technology Specific List.  </s>
<s> So there would not be anything left to check on a core checklist.  </s>
<s> SO I think we should continue to say "technology specific checklist" and "technology specific checklist item".  </s>
<s> And I don't think we should have any "core checklists" that exist separately from the technology specific checklists.  </s>
<s> As always, I'm interested in comments since this is a tricky area and it is easy to miss things.  </s>

<s> Gregg,  </s>
<s> There is definitely something confusing about the description of "Technology-specific Checklists" in section 5. It states that the checklist  </s>
<s> "must include technology-specific checklist items that address every  </s>
<s> success criterion in the guidelines."  </s>
<s> But Section 3.2 states that "for a  </s>
<s> given technology, it is not necessary to provide Techniques for every checkpoint if the checkpoint is not applicable to the technology and the technology is designed to be used with another technology."  </s>
<s> I read 3.2 to mean that not every checkpoint will apply to every technology.  </s>
<s> If the checkpoint doesn't apply, then neither do the the success criteria for that checkpoint.  </s>
<s> So then how can we require, in Section 5, that there must be technology-specific checklist items for every  </s>
<s> success criterion in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> For example, what would the HTML checklist item for checkpoint 1.1 Level 2 success criteria: "the text-equivalent has been reviewed and is believed to be..."? Andi andisnow@us.ibm.com  </s>

<s> Here are a few suggestions.  </s>
<s> First, it may be recalled that we plan to write "core techniques" covering those success criteria of which the implementation is not dependent on the features of any specific technology.  </s>
<s> In each checklist, we could combine checklist items from the core techniques with technology-specific checklist items so that the entire set of guidelines is covered in the resulting checklist.  </s>
<s> If we decide to set an absolute requirement that every checklist must cover every checkpoint in the guidelines, then this would be tantamount to a decision that "dependent" technologies such as CSS, which are intended to be used in conjunction with other formats, could not have their own checklists.  </s>
<s> For example, there could be an (X)HTML + CSS + DOM/Ecmascript checklist but neither a CSS nor a DOM/Ecmascript checklist alone.  </s>
<s> I think there is still an unresolved question as to whether that is the result we want.  </s>
<s> For the purpose of developing the Techniques schema we don't have to resolve these issues, so work on the standard format for techniques can proceed apace even if the finer details regarding checklists haven't been completely worked out.  </s>
<s> The most important point, I would argue, with this draft of the requirements document is that we agree on what should be included in the techniques and the rough details of the output formats we plan to support.  </s>
<s> Tomorrow's meeting will, however, provide an opportunity to elucidate these issues and to arrive at a disposition concerning the requirements document.  </s>
<s> We can of course attempt to resolve these issues at the meeting, but if further work is needed then the working group may decide to proceed with publication of the requirements after inserting an appropriate editorial comment at a suitable point in the document.  </s>
<s> I think the most important point is to ensure that we have a solid basis on which to develop the schema for techniques, and that some of the issues concerning the output formats can be safely postponed as long as they don't affect the source XML format currently under development.  </s>
<s> Yes - One of the confusions that remains in the technology requirements doc is whether Technology Specific Checklists needed to meet all the Success Criteria for all Checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Thanks for catching it.  </s>
<s> We need to clean that up.  </s>
<s> We had one discussion on it.  </s>
<s> The result of that discussion was that Yes they did.  </s>
<s> Otherwise people could think they met the guidelines because they met all the items on the checklist for their technology, when in fact the checklist did not cover all the necessary requirements in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Also, you can imagine checklists for technologies that would just leave items off because there was no way to meet that requirement with that technology.  </s>
<s> When in fact if level one items can't be met with the technology, then it should be clear from the checklist that the content would need to be provided in another accessible form as well.  </s>
<s> CSS, JPGs, GIFs are all examples of technologies that are not presentation technologies in themselves, but components of an HTML page (or other technologies).  </s>
<s> Actually, a CSS sheet shouldn't contain any information.  </s>
<s> JPEGs for example don't have any checkpoints for the technology itself but presenting a page as a big JPEG would definitely not meet the guidelines.  </s>
