<s> Hi there from New Zealand, Firstly thanks for your great service, I have downloaded many files to help me with my current project.  </s>
<s> However I cannot download the following webpage.  </s>
<s> getps I only get back 40 bytes (as below).  </s>
<s> The page contains many formulae, that would be nice to have, so I wanted to download it as a PS file, but it seems to hang?  </s>
<s> Many thanks, Geoff...... Details for Current Page URL : http://www.database.com/~lemur/dmh-airy-1826.html.ps  </s>
<s> Request Time : Tue Mar 23 18:53:19 1999 Delivery Time : Tue Mar 23 18:53:28 1999 Please report BUGS to : www4mail-comments@w3.org We need your feedback to help keep this service going.  </s>

<s> It would appear that the GETPS command is not working on your current server.  </s>
<s> It should work okay if you try the www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it  </s>
<s> server.  </s>
<s> PS: Quite a complicated page (you should get a mail with 8 parts) |-) We shall try to sort GETPS on the server you use normally.  </s>
<s> Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
<s> Dear, This appears to be a problem with the html2ps porgram.  </s>
<s> It apparently wants to have ImageMagick for Perl installed especially on a RedHat system, well I modified to ignore completely ImageMagick and to use pbm tools instead which seems to be installed by default on RedHat systems.  </s>
<s> What I have done is to include the html2ps_lynx and html2ps package in the patch 7 tar.gz  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> (http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~www4mail/src/www4mail-patch03241999.tar.gz)  </s>
<s> That would fix the GETPS problems except you don't want to offer that option.  </s>
<s> Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
