Hi there from New Zealand, Firstly thanks for your great service, I have downloaded many files to help me with my current project. 
However I cannot download the following webpage. 
getps I only get back 40 bytes (as below). 
The page contains many formulae, that would be nice to have, so I wanted to download it as a PS file, but it seems to hang? 
Many thanks, Geoff...... Details for Current Page URL : http://www.database.com/~lemur/dmh-airy-1826.html.ps

It would appear that the GETPS command is not working on your current server. 
It should work okay if you try the www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it 
server. 
PS: Quite a complicated page (you should get a mail with 8 parts) |-) We shall try to sort GETPS on the server you use normally. 
Thanks Clement Onime 
Dear, This appears to be a problem with the html2ps porgram. 
It apparently wants to have ImageMagick for Perl installed especially on a RedHat system, well I modified to ignore completely ImageMagick and to use pbm tools instead which seems to be installed by default on RedHat systems. 
What I have done is to include the html2ps_lynx and html2ps package in the patch 7 tar.gz 
file. 
(http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~www4mail/src/www4mail-patch03241999.tar.gz) 
That would fix the GETPS problems except you don't want to offer that option. 
Thanks Clement Onime
