<s> I'm trying to use lynx to place a secure order on:  </s>
<s> In reading through the lynx.cfg  </s>
<s> file, I notice that there is some reference to ssl but for some reason, it seems that https lynx are unsupported.  </s>
<s> Is this the case?  </s>
<s> If so, is there a work around in the form of a patch or an  </s>
<s> optional statement in the .cfg?  </s>
<s> If not, is there a plan to make it possible to use lynx_w32 with ssl?  </s>
<s> Especially not that it seems the restriction has been lifted with regard to export.  </s>
<s> Thanks! the mint would like to know.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] Until last week, there was a licensing conflict that  </s>
<s> prevented the redistribution of SSL Lynx, but not of the patches and Lynx independently.  </s>
<s> Commercial use would have required royalty payments in the USA, and possibly other countries.  </s>
<s> The patent on RSA has now expired, and the Lynx mailing list is currently considering the implications.  </s>
<s> There are still some issues to do with US export legislation, although this probably amounts to getting the electronic paperwork straight, as the export controls on opoen source software were greatly relaxed early this year; SSL Lynx would not have been exportable this time last year.  </s>
<s> Note the copyright on RSAREF is probably still valid, so previous US builds are probably still non-redistributable, but an OpenSSL version should be.  </s>
<s> NB. some of the symmetric ciphers that can be used in SSL may be still in patent, but (IANAL) I believe that DES and triple DES are out of patent and that MD5 is royalty free.  </s>
<s> SSL, itself, is patented (by Netscape), but royalty free.  </s>
<s> RSA was not royalty free for commercial users, and Lynx's GPL requires the software to be royalty free for all potential users.  </s>

<s> One other point to bear in mind is that some web sites insist on specific browsers being used for SSL.  </s>
<s> Part of the reasoning for this is that they want someone to blame if there is a security breach.  </s>
<s> Some Lynx users forge the User Agent to get into those site, but, in my view, anyone doing so would be at risk of being accused of fraud (the sites tend to be financial organisations).  </s>
<s> (There is a tradeoff here between the fact that there is a company with a reputation to protect behind commercial browsers and the open source nature of things like Lynx allowing independent verification.  </s>
<s> In these plug and play days, it would not be difficult for someone to distribute a compromised binary of an open source program.)  </s>

<s> Personally, I have never encountered a site that required SSL that did also require JavaScript.  </s>
<s> Seems to me that Lynx users are still being unnecessarily discriminated against.  </s>
<s> this is all fine, but is there a fix?  </s>
<s> I have found many such sites.  </s>
<s> For example, to make secured purchases at Amazon.com it is not necessary to run javascript, but SSL is necessary (although they also provide the option of an insecure purchase).  </s>
<s> I am sure there are many others.  </s>
