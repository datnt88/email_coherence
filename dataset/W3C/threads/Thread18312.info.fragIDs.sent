<s> Greg, In your comments [1] to the W3C user agent working group you suggested that checkpoint 7.3 should have stronger minimum requirements.  </s>
<s> The working group also feels the same way and has struggled with this issue for a long time, but has not been able to come up with a better minimum requirement that we can reach consensus on.  </s>
<s> This issue is currently logged as issue 414 [2].  </s>
<s> The working group would like to consider any proposal you would like to make for changing the minimum requirement, otherwise the issue will be considered resolved with no change.  </s>
<s> Look forward to hearing from you and thanks again for your comments, Jon [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0310.html [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#414  </s>

<s> Why not provide a checkpoint at P2 that provides for more powerful methods of navigation (my candidates would be backward sequential, page up, and page down, with Lynx as the implementation example).  </s>

<s> This goes mostly to the definition of priorities in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Although it adds a new checkpoint, it doesn't add a new requirement per se, simply providing a further set of "minimum requirements" to the same checkpoint in order to satisfy a higher level of accessibility.  </s>
<s> As Greg pointed out, simple forwards navigation only provides a very low level of accessibility - all the content can be accessed (meeting the defining requirement for level A) but to overcome a significant obstacle further access is required (i.e. meeting the definitive requirement for double-A).  </s>
