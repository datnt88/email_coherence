<s> Anyone else's thoughts / opinions?  </s>
<s> Best regards, Denise  </s>
<s> What seminar?  </s>
<s> Sorry, I was typing too fast!  </s>
<s> I meant the eSeminar that Adobe provided today regarding their accessibility products / initiatives.  </s>
<s> What seminar?  </s>
<s> I didn't, but some folks from my company (Reef) did.  </s>
<s> I'll see what they thought (but most of them were Marketing folks, not Web Developers!)... David Poehlman re-posted the announcement to the WAI list on August 23; here is a copy of that, if you didn't see it before.  </s>
<s> Note that there is another running of the eSeminar on 11 September.  </s>
