<s> 3.6 Optional Matching It must be possible to express a query graph pattern that does not fail to match when some nominated part of the graph pattern fails to match.  </s>
<s> Any such triples matched by this optional part, or variable bindings caused by this optional part, can be requested in the results.  </s>
<s> Andy For reference, the text in v1.39 is: 3.6 Optional Match It must be possible to express a query that does not fail when some nominated part of the query specifying "optional triples" fails to match.  </s>
<s> Any such triples matched by this optional part, or variable bindings caused by this optional part, can be returned in the results, if requested.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid I can't really support this as a requirement, although I think features which allow this result (albeit not necessary directly) would almost certainly be extremely useful.  </s>
<s> The thing is, "optional bindings" are really nothing more than unions between independent queries: union the results of the query with the binding with the results of the query without it.  </s>
<s> I'd say a more general-purpose "union" operator is quite a bit more important than this one particular form, and even then I'm not sure whether it rises to the level of requirement.  </s>
<s> Expressing it as "Optional Matching" makes it more user-centric.  </s>
<s> It covers features that are being requested by users (application writers).  </s>
<s> Getting AB? (where A and B are graph patterns, ? is 0 or 1) as union(A, AB) might be OK but as the choices grow we get: AB?C? = union(A, AB, AC, ABC) Andy  </s>
<s> maybe.  </s>
<s> i guess it depends on what is meant by union.  </s>
<s> regardless, our goal is not a *minimal* query language but a useful one.  </s>
<s> as andy noted, RDQL users have requested optional triples.  </s>
<s> and, implementing optional triples as multiple union queries could strain the capabilities of query optimizers.  </s>
<s> seems like it's more efficient to make optional triples explicit.  </s>
<s> SQL has both union and outer join, for example.  </s>
