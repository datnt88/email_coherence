Checkpoint 3.3 says Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. 
[Priority 2] For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element to contro font styles. 
This implies that we should not do the following I don't see any practical consequences of doing this. 
We're specifying the logical classification of the text via H1. Screenreaders will ignore the font. 
People with low vision can override the font. 
So what's the harm? 
I don't think we should rule out such cases. 
There's just one problem I can think of, a bug in some versions of Navigator that don't fully override colors, even though there's a menu item to do that. 
I've come across that in the past. 
But at most, that means that you should precede this with "Until user agents fix bugs in allowing users to override font sizes and colors....". 
And even then, do we know that style sheet override doesn't have bugs of it's own? 
Plus, even though we have to worry about features that are just plain absent, I don't think we should worry too much about every bug in every browser or screenreader... the added complexity and just isn't worth it I think.

I almost agree. 
The same reasoning applies to using color for meaning: great, as long as you also convey the meaning through other means. 
However, for the case you site, no specification ensures that users can override the font. 
Browsers may do this, but the HTML spec does not require or guarantee this. 
CSS describes an override mechanism, 
hence the promotion of CSS. 
Note that I have no objection to the above HTML in addition to CSS, since CSS suggestions (though sadly does not require) that CSS-enabled user agents make CSS style higher precedence in the cascade than markup language style. 
There are other reasons (not related to accessibilty) to avoid FONT and to use STYLE or external style sheets instead, such as page/site management.

Ian, Thanks for pointing that out. 
That's an even stronger reason to go with style, stronger than what I discovered about netscape navigator.. that even the 4.7 version doesn't allow complete override--even to the extent implied by their edit preferences. 
So I withdraw my suggestion that font be allowed inside structural elements.
