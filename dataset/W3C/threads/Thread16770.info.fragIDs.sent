Published on December 19 and recently placed online by the US Department of Education, the final report of the Web-Based Education Commission (WBEC) constitutes the "most comprehensive analysis ever undertaken of education and the Internet." 
Chaired by Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, the WEBC urged the new administration and Congress to fully embrace e-learning, address gaps in Internet access, and revise certain regulations that they believe impede innovation. 
Users can read the full text of the 169-page report in its entirety or in five parts in .pdf 
format. 
Even though the report at: http://www.ed.gov/offices/AC/WBEC/FinalReport/ appears to have up before section 508 took effect, I find it an interesting commentary on how the commission really feels about access to education for people with disabilties, that this report is available only in PDF format. 
This is one of the most inaccessible formats possible. 
Even with the newer reader many people still have issues with PDF. 
It is a format that is designed for printing and should never be the only format available. 
This says to me, that they really don't care and the commission, by allowing this, shows great contempt for the issues involving people with disabilties and distance education. 
PDF files are easy to make, too bad they could not 
take the extra time to make the report accessible. 
I personally hate PDF files, they are hard for me to read and to navigate. 
I find it incredibly contemptuous of this commission to post the report in this format alone. 
Sincerely,

I've never understood the attraction of PDF. 
I am sighted (near 20-20 with glasses) have a good monitor, have good muscular control of the mouse (enough to hold my own in a game of Quake) and keyboard (touch-typist), and I still find PDFs to be inaccessible! 
Sure they print out nicely compared to many other formats, but they are a pain to read online and the files are quite often coffee-files (A file which gives you time to make a fresh pot of coffee while it downloads). 
In most cases the choice of PDF is just a plain bad decision before you even begin to think about accessibility issues. 
(Yes, there are times when PDF is suitable, I'm not looking for a flame war :) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGPfreeware 6.5.3 for non-commercial use http://www.pgp.com iQA/AwUBO3Js5IFpv9f1Mr0YEQJeEwCfUS83HQ6WzIQx2TlLog/YhTr64JYAoIDK z/3LhFR84xzSOHosXev/b0bC =DcOh -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- 
PDF's use depends upon your business requirements. 
NOT everyone has a need for it. 
however, there are great usages for it. 
Espscially to collate multiple formats into one document and to ensure documents are printable across multiple printers and it is device independent where you just need the reader. 
adobe has worked hard to educate the community on the base documents's accessibility needs in that if the document is generate properly then it will convert easily to PDF for viewing and reading as well as converting to text or HTML. 
unfortunately the blame is attributed to PDF, when the web masters could have easily offered mulitple fomrats for example, posted a text and the document in its native format. 
i also wonder if the native document was proplery constructed with the use of headings? 
it is still going to take web folks and agencies time to procure the proper tools and to be educated on the process so it becomes second nature.

The attraction to authors is that it produces repeatable presentation, which is what designers want and try to force HTML to achieve (often making unsafe assumptions in the process). 
I'd rather designers were honest with themselves and used a tool that matched what they were trying to achieve, than forced HTML to be something other than HTML. 
When they are not expending all their effort fighting the medium, they might just spend some of it on accessibility. 
The bloat is not the fault of PDF. 
A file optimised for PDF should be about the same size as a .zip of the equivalent web site (smaller if commercial art has had to be converted to raster form for the web site). 
I find PDF a handy format for large documents that I want to be able to search in their entirety, and, until SVG (which could be considered a PDF derivative!) is generally available, its the only reasonable portable way of efficiently coding technical diagrams. 
It's especially useful for documents that are accessed offline. 
The outline tree (bookmark) display is also useful. 
The bloat comes from two main sources: - PDFs of old documents are essentially just PNGs of each page with a small structuring layer on top - if you are lucky there will also be an OCRed text underlay; - PDFs created from word processors reflect the bloat that is in the PostScript from those word processors, e.g. modern versions of MSWord place each character individually, whereas optimal PDF would output a sentence at a time with a stretch factor - this also improves accessibility, as each line is plain text.
