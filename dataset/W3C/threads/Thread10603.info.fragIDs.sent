<s> Herman, Peter, After the flurry of recent discussion about the semantics doc, there is a proposal to RDFCore to consider a minor expositional change to the document  </s>
<s> along with some fixes to types.  </s>
<s> This proposal is made in the agenda for Friday's telecon, agenda item 10 of  </s>
<s> I would be grateful if you would look at these changes and say that they are  </s>
<s> acceptable to you.  </s>

<s> As far as I can see right now, the changes to the normative sections of the document do not make the document any worse.  </s>
<s> I do suggest, however, that one of the new entries in the change log is incorrect and, worse, misleading.  </s>

<s> The changes are acceptable, although the suggestion has not been adopted not to require all values of a datatype in a D-interpretation, to bring the definition of D-interpretation more in line with the rest of the RDF Semantics document, and to allow a completeness lemma for D-entailment.  </s>
<s> The small error that I noted in the definition of D-interpretation (in connection with the vocabulary formed by the datatype URIs in D) has been corrected, in an elegant way.  </s>

<s> I note that the suggestion to not require all values of a datatype in a D-interpretation, which has not been adopted, makes noticeable, significant, and negative changes to D-entailment.  </s>
<s> I see no reason that there could not be a completeness lemma for D-entailment under the current model theory for RDF datatyping.  </s>
<s> Peter F. Patel-Schneider  </s>
<s> I have reviewed the proposed changes and I support them.  </s>
<s> I would marginally prefer a slightly more explicit word than "Following" in the change log, sentence: "Following comments by ter Horst , the definition of D-interpretation has been re-worded."  </s>
<s> my (tiny) concern being that the re-wording follows Herman's comment in time but not in substance.  </s>
<s> Possible rewording would be s/Following/After considering/  </s>
<s> If the editor or chairs do not wish us to consider this change that is no problem.  </s>

<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> So changed in the 2004bcc version.  </s>
