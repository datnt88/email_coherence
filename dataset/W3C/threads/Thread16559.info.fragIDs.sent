<s> Pei Ling, There are several tools that produce XHTML (HTML that is written in XML) either as authoring tools or as conversion tools.  </s>

<s> Thank you Charles, for such a fast response.  </s>
<s> Yes Charles, I'll very much appreciate that you could make the information available, hope it's not too much of trouble to you.  </s>
<s> Just curiosity, why is it that you think it's impossible in specifying the algorithm?  </s>
<s> For tools, is there any recommendations that you would like to have for me?  </s>
<s> As I mentioned I'm in doing final year project in the school (School of Information Technology in Nanyang Polytechnic), this is the scenario I've thought of and wish to deploy.  </s>
<s> The objective of my project scope is to have an automated scheduled job updates for an finance information portal by deploying agents to the Web to search for all relevent as well as the latest finance updates.  </s>
<s> I have the intention to convert their search results(inclusive of the HTML documents) they ought to bring back, into XML docs, first it's for easy reference, second, an easier way for me to ask another agent to help me put up the information into my portal.  </s>
<s> I don't wish the poor agent guy to be confused on issues like which is a heading and which aren't and in the end, cannot get the job done.  </s>
<s> Also, it's for easy updates into the database for SQL retrieval.  </s>
<s> Basically that's what my scope requires.  </s>
<s> If there's any comment on how I should go about attaining my objective, please share with me.  </s>
<s> I'm more than willingly to hear opinions from all angles.  </s>
<s> Once again, thanks for your precious comment.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] The fact that converting headings from HTML to XML (in the form of XHTML) is a non-problem makes me think that there is either a misunderstanding of XML behind the question or there is more to the question that has been given here.  </s>
<s> Could you please explain why translating h2 text /h2 into h2 text /h2 doesn't meet your requirments.  </s>
<s> On the more general question, both HTML Tidy and Amaya, both referenced from the W3C web site, should be able to convert valid, almost valid, and in the case of Tidy) somewhat broken, HTML into XHTML, i.e. an instance of XML. --------------------------- DISCLAIMER --------------------------------- Any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender, except where the sender specifically states them to be the views of BTS.  </s>
