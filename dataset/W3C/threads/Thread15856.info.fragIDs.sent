<s> I am trying to understand more about how to use the SCOPE and HEADERS attribute for labeling table cells.  </s>
<s> The examples at the end of the authoring guidelines are for very simple tables and I wonder about how these would really apply to many of today's tables that are used for layout.  </s>
<s> Is it even appropriate to use these attributes for layout based pages considering this is against the ethos of the working guidelines?  </s>
<s> I have to admit, I'm finding these attributes confusing.  </s>
<s> In particular, I don't understand how to do labeling when using: 1) nested tables, 2) column and/or row groups.  </s>
<s> And I don't have a clear idea when I would really want to use the HEADERS, the SCOPE, or the more general AXIS.  </s>
<s> In many ways, the AXIS attribute seems less about accessibility, and more about alternative views of the data.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if anyone has prepared a more comprehensive set of examples using these attributes, or if anyone has implemented a simple text-based table browser that is designed to help work with these issues.  </s>

<s> It is not appropriate to use SCOPE and HEADERS for layout tables.  </s>
<s> These are to be used when one cell (de_facto header) gives generic inforation about one or more other cells.  </s>
<s> Pure layout tables don't have these logical relationships between cells in the grid.  </s>
<s> For nested tables, I would have to see what it is used for to comment.  </s>
<s> For column or row groups you may use AXIS to construct a category hierarchy.  </s>
<s> That is, use AXIS if you have second-order metadata visible in the table.  </s>
<s> Yes, it is about alternate views.  </s>
<s> It was supported by the WAI reviewers, not invented by them.  </s>
<s> Alternate views have proved helpful in audio browsing of complex tables in some (not exhaustive) experiments.  </s>
<s> All the HC work is still public.  </s>
<s> If you don't find what you want in terms of a life-size example in the final HTML 4 language, you may find it helpful to review the discussion for some interpretation.  </s>
<s> This just gives you a rough orientation to the general ideas.  </s>
<s> This is a good topic for the page authoring subgroup list.  </s>

<s> Hiya.  </s>
<s> I have followed this listserv now for several months.  </s>
<s> As a non-tech person, I struggle with a lot of what I have read because it often assumes I have knowledge I don't have.  </s>
<s> I'm not giving up, though, because I want  </s>
<s> to understand the new standards and how to implement them.  </s>
<s> I will have the job of educating several hundred people to meet those standards.  </s>
<s> My first job will be convincing those several hundred people that accessibility is important but, somehow, that job seems easy compared to understanding 1) the standards, 2) how to implement them, and 3) the esoteric language often used on this listserv.  </s>
<s> Please bear with me.  </s>
<s> Ironically, I am finding that my ignorance is denying me accessibility to learning about accessibility.  </s>

<s> WL:: Hopefully these concerns are being (effectively?) addressed by the EO (Education &amp; Outreach) Working Group.  </s>
<s> The first "tangible" output might be a brochure addressing the "accessibility is important" part.  </s>
<s> The more difficult parts you express concern about will be dealt with in several ways but: "esoteric language" might describe HTML and it is fairly clear that until authoring tools (the purview of another Working Group called the AU group) pretty much force guideline compliance, the authors of web sites will have to deal with such esoterica.  </s>
<s> As long as there are programs that pretend to convert word processor or page making documents into valid, accessible HTML code there is no alternative to dealing with HTML itself if one cares about accessibility in both the sense of access to persons with disabilities and the more general meaning of the term as a main goal of "universal design": what's more accessible for blind guys is more accessible for all of us (as well as for "webphones", WebTV, PDAs or even PagerWeb - God help us!).  </s>

<s> Concerning nested tables: SCOPE and HEADERS can refer only to cells of the _same_ table in which they appear.  </s>
<s> A nested table is a content of a cell of a table.  </s>
<s> It is impossible to refer to it from a cell of the nesting table exactly as it is impossible to refer to a list or a paragraph in a particular cell.  </s>
