Dear W3C QA Interest Group and W3C translators. 
One of the goals of the Quality Assurance Activity at W3C is to ensure consistency and quality in the terminology used in our technical reports/specifications. 
This is why the QA activity has decided to lead the project of a unified W3C glossary, combined with a multilingual dictionary for translators. 
We are now in the requirements gathering phase, and I hereby ask for your input on: - features - data model - existing tools - existing similar pieces of work I have summed-up a few ideas at: This document will grow as ideas get submitted. 
Every good idea is welcome, although, of course, I cannot guarantee that all submitted ideas will be implemented in the actual service. 
Please reply (with good sense) to me, privately (ot@w3.org), 
to the QAIG list (www-qa@w3.org) or the translator's list (w3c-translators@w3.org). 
When this requirement-gathering phase ends, we'll look at existing software, and decide whether to use one of those or develop our own. 
Thank you very much in advance. 
Olivier Hello Olivier! 
Sounds well! 
If You like to include my German dict into your work, feel free to do that. 
If You have any questions, just mail me. 
If there is a list of terms/words to translate some day, you can contact me for the translation or for a review. 
There is another German dict by Stefan Mintert: Stefan Stefan Schumacher Oesterberg 20 0172/2718968 58553 Halver 02353/130119 Germany www.schumacher-netz.de
