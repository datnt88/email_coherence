<s> I asked the lead author of Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF / XML which is a Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) standards-track document to comment on the datatypes issues that were being brought up.  </s>
<s> We've exchanged emails but not got really to a terse summary.  </s>
<s> I'm the lead editor of Expressing Simple Dublin Core in RDF/XML So the following is my opinion with my DC hat on, NOT an official view of the DCMI.  </s>
<s> In the notes below, the set of 15 elements is the DCMI is the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES).  </s>
<s> 1. DCMI uses XML Namespaces for grouping concepts DCMI Namespace Policy 2. DCMI will define only 1 term for a concept, in some namespace.  </s>
<s> So like for PRISM (also a DCMES in RDF/XML app) - DCMES will not define multiple versions of terms.  </s>
<s> 3. URIs for DCMI terms are constructed by appending the term name to the namespace URI for the term.  </s>
<s> See namespace policy document above.  </s>
<s> 3. DCMES already uses and recommends the following RDF/XML for writing simple DCMES property and value.  </s>
<s> and for RDF/XML expects the triple thing dc:title "title of thing" .  </s>
<s> to be emitted Plus is allowed.  </s>
<s> Both may be used at the same time.  </s>
<s> 4. DCMI provides RDF Schemas at the namespace URIs of its terms So providing extra datatyping info for each term is possible.  </s>
<s> 5. DCMI expects xml:lang attribute to be allowed on XML and the DCMI community wants to be able to get at that language value somehow.  </s>
<s> I strongly support this.  </s>
<s> I have been asked by some people in DCMI community how RDF models this and could not give an answer.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> The DCMI has the idea of "encoding schemes" for expanding on the  </s>
<s> value of the simple string valued property like above.  </s>
<s> This is the closest thing to data types here.  </s>
<s> In the Qualified DC in RDF/XML document above, it is recommended to model like this (If I understand it correctly).  </s>
<s> The rdfs:isDefinedBy might point to any relevant URI2 that defines the encoding - such as a term in a controlled vocabulary; this would not be to an RDF(s) document.  </s>
<s> Optionally an rdf:type might also be used to point to a node of type rdfs:Class in an rdf schema if such existed.  </s>
<s> The rdf:value isn't required to point to a literal; it might point to another blank node with another rdf:value, rdfs:label There is probably more, but I'll stop here.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Thanks Dave.  </s>
<s> Do DC use any xsd datatypes?  </s>
<s> Date presumably.  </s>
<s> Any others.  </s>
<s> Would be good to follow DanC's suggestion for use cases.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian McBride said:  </s>
<s> The DC desn't use W3C XML Schema datatypes yet in the DC in RDF/XML formats.  </s>
<s> There has been some investigation of using W3C XML Schema for validating DC in XML, but no official work on using the datatypes there, as far as I know.  </s>
<s> The nearest is the XML and W3C XML Schema based Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML which is still under a lot of discussion, not official at all and again, doesn't use the datatypes.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Dave, this keeps coming up and I would like to tackle it, but Im not sure how, or even if, this XML feature is supposed to map into RDF triples.  </s>
<s> If the answer is obvious to you, could you briefly explain it, using Ntriples?  </s>
<s> Many thanks.  </s>
<s> Hmm, thats an interesting idea.  </s>
<s> What would rdf:value mean if it wasnt pointing to a literal?  </s>
<s> For example what relationship between _:x and _:y would this state: _:x rdf:value _:y .  </s>
<s> _:y rdf:value "10" .  </s>

<s> Dave said:  </s>
<s> Some answers I see are: 1 N-Triples (current version) thing dc:title "title of thing" .  </s>
<s> Loses the language; but there might be an application-specific method on the model that returned the language string.  </s>
<s> However, this is old RDF M&amp;S territory and if it isn't in the model, how can it be interoperable?  </s>
<s> 2 Ntriples+ (with lang-strings): thing dc:title "title of thing"(en) .  </s>
<s> See Jeremy and Bill deHora's analysis: but it does seem awfully tricky and a bit ugly adding another pair where there used to be a Unicode string.  </s>
<s> Maybe the proper expansion (to 3 triples with a bnode) is what we will have to recommend, and deprecate the method above in favour of which generates the 3 Ntriples by using an abbreviated syntax form: thing dc:title _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a xml:lang "en" .  </s>
<s> _:a rdf:value "title of thing" .  </s>
<s> Howver that will be a *very* hard sell to the DC community.  </s>
<s> i.e without language and with: will be hard to explain  </s>
<s> The DC idea being referred to here was historically labelled "dumbing  </s>
<s> down".  </s>
<s> This was for DC applications just looking for literals about  </s>
<s> a resource (node) for some purpose, they follow the rdf:value arcs until they get a string, and use that.  </s>
<s> It is a flattening algorithm for all the properties of a resource.  </s>
<s> See 3.2 of http://dublincore.org/documents/2001/11/30/dcq-rdf-xml/  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Pat Hayes asked:  </s>
<s> To bring back an example from olden times, you need one more statement: document dc:subject _:x and the interpretation is that document dc:subject "10" is the most acceptable loss of information if one must simplify (perhaps radically) the model for some reason and one has no application-specific knowledge of what to keep and what to delete.  </s>
<s> So, to answer your question, _:x rdf:value "10" is the abbreviation of your model above that best preserves its intent.  </s>
<s> It would still be the best if _:x had started with 10k other properties.  </s>
<s> Search for 'dumb-down rule' on Google for metadata specs where this convention has been used.  </s>
<s> Assumed constraints are that there should only be one rdf:value from a node.  </s>
<s> Assumption is that the chain of rdf:values ends in a string.  </s>
<s> If the document has multiple dc:subject properties, they SHOULD all have different strings at the end of the rdf:value chains.  </s>
<s> Ron  </s>
<s> As pointed out to Pat's message, this doesn't work because the literal itself is not English.  </s>
<s> It may have an English interpretation in a particular context but the literal itself, theoretically, could have meaning in multiple languages.  </s>
<s> C.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0171.html  </s>
<s> I have the sinking suspicion that both the DC "poor man's" approach and the dumbing down principle, may need to be  </s>
<s> rethought and/or refined in terms of typed data literals  </s>
<s> rather than the present basis of strings that are presumed to have globally consistent meaning (but, based on all that has come out of these datatyping discussions, actually don't).  </s>
<s> But that's quite another discussion entirely, and one for the DC lists.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> Im beginning to wonder quite what the point of the lang tag is supposed to be.  </s>
<s> Up to now Ive been thinking of it as a kind of datatype, but is that really appropriate?  </s>
<s> The basic reason for having datatyping is to allow a single literal to have many meanings.  </s>
<s> But that really isnt an issue with lang, right?  </s>
<s> I mean, nobody is going to think that a German title is an English title, and even in Canada when they write 'sauce soy sauce' on the bottles, its clear which part is English and which part is French.  </s>
<s> So I guess the point of lang is really to *record* the fact of the matter about which languae the literal is written in; its really a fact about the literal (string) rather than anything like a datatyping mapping applied to the literal.  </s>
<s> (I mean, what would the value space be for, say, lang:en ?  </s>
<s> It would be the identity on English strings and nothing on others, persumably.  </s>
<s> But if we are dealing with titles, almost anything  </s>
<s> *could* be an English string, eg "10", or an Italian string ("8&amp;1/2"), or whatever.  </s>
<s> )  </s>
<s> All of which leads me to think that the proper way to handle lang  </s>
<s> would be as a property of a literal, if only we had properties of  </s>
<s> literals....  </s>

<s> _:1 rdf:value "pan" .  </s>
<s> _:1 xml:lang _:2 .  </s>
<s> _:2 rdf:value "en" .  </s>
<s> _:2 rdf:dtype xsd:lang .  </s>
<s> We just don't allow the literals to be subjects (and of course now that literals are tidy, we couldn't do that anyway ;-) Patrick  </s>
<s> There are situations in which it may be important for a *machine* to know the language of a literal; e.g. when doing text-to-speech transcoding, or Google-like content searches.  </s>
<s> I think the distinction between recording a fact and mapping the meaning can become a bit blurred.  </s>
<s> But I suppose you're right in the sense that the language doesn't have any effect on the interpretation of literals as far as pure RDF semantics are concerned.  </s>
<s> Yes, that would be nice.  </s>
<s> But isn't a datatype also used as a kind of property of a literal?  </s>
<s> Maybe a language tag could be a datatype class whose literal and value spaces are just character strings, with identity mapping, for the purposes of RDF semantics?  </s>
