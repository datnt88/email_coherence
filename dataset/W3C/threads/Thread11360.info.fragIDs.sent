<s> More on addressing.  </s>
<s> On March 15, the ERB agreed that:  </s>
<s> 1. Contrary to our decision of last time, we will support subelement addressing by a simple search operator.  </s>
<s> We will make it clear that  </s>
<s> bit-for-bit matching without respect to words or tokens is compliant behavior; if implementations wish to compete on the basis of case-folding or other fancy search optimization, that's fine.  </s>
<s> 2. Locators shall consist of a URL, optionally followed by a '#'  </s>
<s> 3. The '#' may be followed by the string " tei ", in which case the  </s>
<s> remainder of the locator is to be treated as a TEI extended pointer.  </s>
<s> Michael Sperberg-McQueen has an action item to figure out the required changes to TEI xptr syntax to fit them into a URL.  </s>
<s> Note: with respect to our previous concerns on internationalization, we investigated and it appears that both Netscape and MSIE are trying to do the right thing; while there remain bugs in this area, our policy seems to be reasonable.  </s>
<s> On another subject, we agonized further over the fact that current implementations of '#' in URLs always fetch the whole document and then navigate to the fragment in the client.  </s>
<s> For SGML, this is  </s>
<s> probably often unreasonable.  </s>
<s> Too bad - this behavior is not carved in stone; early implementations that stupidly try to fetch the entire OED or Physician's Desk Reference, just to pull out a fragment, will not succeed in the marketplace  </s>
<s> CONUNDRUM: 4. If the '#' is followed only by a string, then.... what?  </s>
<s> This should be an IDREF, right?  </s>
<s> Maybe.  </s>
<s> And if it is, how do you know how to find ID attributes in an XML document out at the far end of a URL?  </s>
<s> Can you be sure of finding the appropriate declaration in the internal DTD subset?  </s>
<s> Can you be sure of finding the external subset?  </s>
<s> On the Web, in the URL "http://foo.bar.com/baz.html#sec1.2", the "sec1.2"  </s>
<s> should correspond to a A NAME='sec1.2'.  </s>
<s> It is not, in the HTML DTD, an ID attribute.  </s>
<s> They want to use more characters than SGML ID allows, and they don't want to enforce uniqueness.  </s>
<s> If there is more than one matching NAME=, few browsers will do anything reasonable, but  </s>
<s> it's not an error.  </s>
<s> In fact, the semantics of #-fragments in HTML are easily expressed in a simple TEI xptr query saying "find the first A element whose NAME attribute has the value whatever".  </s>
<s> We could  </s>
<s> duplicate that in XML, but it feels limiting.  </s>
<s> We could duplicate it but, in the linking element, provide other attributes to say what the element type and attribute name you're trying to match are.  </s>
<s> But then you're duplicating something you could do with a "# tei " string.  </s>
<s> Or, we could say that it *is* an IDREF, and by default look for an attribute named 'ID' with the indicated value, and also, if it's  </s>
<s> possible, look in the internal subset or the whole DTD to find out what attributes are IDs.  </s>
<s> This would be weaker than HTML in the allowed values (SGML NAME) and requirement for only one match.  </s>
<s> Big deal?  </s>
<s> What we want is to have a simple behavior that makes sense, specified simply.  </s>
<s> No surprise that it's hard to be simple.  </s>
<s> Input and inspiration from the WG are solicited.  </s>

<s> This sounds like what I need.  </s>
<s> Is 'subelement addressing' a clear term?  </s>
<s> I take it to mean finding a substring or position in a chunk of #PCDATA, by some means either to be further described or left to the application?  </s>
<s> Does this also apply to mixed content or is one expected to have navigated down to the raw #PCDATA...  </s>
<s> I like the idea of regular expressions.  </s>
<s> Is this a 'fancy search'?  </s>
<s> WF XML documents may contain more than one ID (uniqueness is a VC, not a WFC).  </s>
<s> Therefore we need to say something about it, if only to say it's undefined.  </s>
<s> I think that there may be marketing problems with ID rather than NAME.  </s>
<s> I started CML with proper SGML ID/IDREF addressing and changed to HREF/NAME.  </s>
<s> I think my reasons were: - the semantics of HREF/NAME were commonly applied (although fuzzy).  </s>
<s> If you are going to use IDs you will need to educate the webhackers (like me) as to why this is better.  </s>
<s> - since many of my docs were manualy edited I frequently ended up with multiple IDs or IDREFS unresolved.  </s>
<s> This gave (correctly) zillions of errors in sgmls.  </s>
<s> I just felt it was easier to use NAME which had no validity constraints (for me).  </s>
<s> Whether we like it or not, a very large number of people will come to XML from HTML.  </s>
<s> A functioning HREF/NAME mechanism is an attractive thing to give them.  </s>
<s> That is what I would expect as 'reasonable behaviour' for multiple identical IDs or NAMEs.  </s>
<s> Is the intention that in XML there is a default recommendation that all IDs have a name 'ID'?  </s>
<s> (It would certainly help in WF documents which may not otherwise have a means of identifying IDs).  </s>
<s> In summary, if there are behaviours in HTML that we like and can work with, it makes sense to carry them over, even if we have to clarify the semantics.  </s>
<s> Hope this webhacker's view is useful.  </s>
<s> Is it useful at this stage for the pointer to carry information about the MIME type of the target document?  </s>
<s> I would find this very useful myself because it allows downloading a search engine of the appropriate type.  </s>
<s> Thus: A HREF="http://www.venus.co.uk/omf/cml/mydoc.cml#(3  </s>
<s> MOL)" MIME="text/xml" METHOD="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/omf/pmr.chemime.ChemTree"  </s>
<s> This would tell the application that the remote file was expected to be of MIME type text/xml.  </s>
<s> The classes used to search the document are given.  </s>
<s> If the remote document is not text/xml, then there may be an error or some content negotiation.  </s>
<s> You may disagree with this philosophy (that the calling document rather than the called document defines the MIME type), but I suspect we shall use it in our community in some cases.  </s>
<s> [I daren't say what 'MIME' types we use - they might not be text/xml].  </s>
<s> P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences  </s>
<s> If we are allowing # tei why not also allow # id ?  </s>
<s> Then we could reserve #CDATA to be used specifically to identify the name of an anchor in an HTML file referenced from an XML file.  </s>

<s> No kidding.  </s>
<s> We have serious unsolved problems.  </s>
<s> Not only that; that draft also makes it crystal clear that the URL syntax hardwires in the processing model; i.e. if you say URL#fragment, the user agent has to get the whole URL and pick out the fragment.  </s>
<s> Clearly this is a nonstarter for XML, where the fragment might select an entry from the OED... on the other hand using URL?fragment has its own set of problems.  </s>
<s> In fact, what we *really* want is to specify the URL and fragment by way of policy, and let the implementation figure out how to divvy the load between client and server.  </s>
<s> Also, we'd like to do this without egregiously violating the ruling RFC's.  </s>
<s> Which may cost us our ability to declare that "locators are URLs".  </s>
<s> Blecch.  </s>
<s> Double blecch.  </s>
<s> - Tim  </s>
<s> Terry Allen says:  </s>
<s> Tim did not say that the   go in a URL.  </s>
<s> They follow the URL.  </s>
<s> Another way to do this would be to use ;xml-loc-tei=....... which conforms and can be put in a URL.  </s>
<s> (it may actually be treated as a MIME parameter on some systems, but that's OK) Lee  </s>
<s> I just did some tests and it appears that the fragment identifier (the text following the hash on the URL) is even passed to the server, at least for  </s>
<s> HTTP. Thus a server does not even know that you are addressing rather than  </s>
<s> This makes using the fragment identifier for server-side filtering rather difficult, as I see it.  </s>
<s> -derek ddb@criinc.com  </s>
<s> || software-engineer || www/sgml/java/perl/etc.  </s>
<s> There are two points here, which have not been distinguished clearly in what Tim has posted, although I'm sure he has them distinct in his mind.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> What is the URL fragment syntax for XML; that is, what do fragment identifiers mean wrt XML?  </s>
<s> 2. How can the TEI mechanism be used in URLs in general?  </s>
<s> After all, I might want to use URLs with TEI xptrs to point to almost any kind of data, not solely XML.  </s>
<s> Tim's remarks about large XML documents apply just as well to other data formats; they can be big, it may be desired to retrieve only parts of them, and so on.  </s>
<s> It should not be assumed that TEI xptrs are going to be used solely with XML, and thus a solution to (1) above does not provide an answer to (2), unless the limiting assumption is made that for every large data format a special query language must be constructed.  </s>
<s> I assume Eliot would agree ... Regards, Terry Allen Electronic Publishing Consultant tallen[at]sonic.net  </s>
<s> specializing in Web publishing, SGML, and the DocBook DTD A Davenport Group Sponsor: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> We looked at the problem of subdocument addressing in DynaWeb a number of times.  </s>
<s> You cannot use fragment specifiers in URL's if you want server-side processing.  </s>
<s> You can use:  </s>
<s> 1) URL paramaters 2) Query Parameters 3) URL syntax and that's it.  </s>
<s> As I said a long time ago, I prefer (3), hence my proposal, though (2) can be made to work well.  </s>
<s> We assume he means 'NOT even passed to the server'  </s>
<s> In XML, we do *not* want to build the server-side/client-side distinction into the link syntax.  </s>
<s> We want to attach a URL and a TEI xpointer and let the server &amp; client figure out what to do.  </s>
<s> If we want to force server-side processing, the '?' syntax is available.  </s>
<s> There is nothing in the current URL RFC that allows a resource/fragment partitioning without also forcing the process model.  </s>
<s> In my view, this is purely a bug.  </s>
<s> Either we introduce a new syntax, or we overload '#' and let the market deal with it.  </s>
<s> -Tim  </s>
<s> While I agree with the sentiment, I object strongly, very strongly, to overloading the query part of a URL.  </s>
<s> Such usage just confluges the 3 seperate roles of URL's.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> This is why I prefer to use the *pure* URL (none of the fragment or query part, or even URL parameters).  </s>
<s> The pure URL should be regarded as an address, and carries few semantics, which is exectly what we want.  </s>
<s> [first off: Gavin, can you PLEASE start replying just to the group]  </s>
<s> So concretely, you want to have two attributes in an XML linking element: the locator, which is a URL, and another to store the query part?  </s>
<s> -T.  </s>
<s> Something like that, though I'm not convinced that having a query as part of a link is a good idea in the cases where the link is an address.  </s>
<s> This is eay to fix, though.  </s>
<s> An alternate syntax should not be a serious problem...  </s>
<s> No, we need to define the client-side method.  </s>
<s> We can suggest a server-side sytnax, but frankly I doubt that we can do that in a way that will satisfy all the servers (and unprincipled hacks) out there on the server side -- and I don't see that we really need to.  </s>
<s> I think that leaving it to the author to decide how the URL should be done is perfectly reasonable: Things like the OED will not be served up monolithically (probably by contract with OUP!), and so references made by authors (or people browsing a site) will automatically be in terms of URLs that designate smaller, well-formed document fragments.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid that I don't see what the problem is with having two formats, and no standard for the server side.  </s>
<s> Servers can serve up URLs that take advantage of whatever queries they support.  </s>
<s> This does not seem difficult to ensure.  </s>
<s> I don't really see a significant practical advantage (other than neatness) to standardizing the server query syntax.  </s>
<s> I suppose you could do blind queries to a server if you have a common syntax, but I'm not sure that that is a primary goal here... It certainly doesn't seem _required_ to support linking and browsing, which are the de-facto requirements for WWW compatibility.  </s>
<s> Can anyone offer an argument to convince me?  </s>
