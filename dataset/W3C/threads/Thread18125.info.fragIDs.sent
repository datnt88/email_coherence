<s> hi Jon i'd be happy to participate in this call.  </s>
<s> thanks for asking.  </s>
<s> however, i'm concerned about the follow up discussion this request has generated in DOM vs OSM vs API, etc. i'd advocate that DOM is just another tool/method, and if company A chooses to use DOM, or an OSM, or some other idea, that is company A's decision.  </s>
<s> i don't support the concept that *all* companies have to use DOM .  </s>
<s> I understand the advantages and dis-advantages, just concerned about any "tone" we present to the AT community.  </s>
<s> i'm also concerned about how much push there is to add the "chrome" to DOM. Rich said it best, when he replied yesterday regarding the DOM working group meeting he attended last week: In fact, it was amazing how many of the other companies present at the DOM 3 working group meeting had a need for an application architecture based on DOM.  </s>
<s> Please don't mis-interpret me.  </s>
<s> I understand the need, and I would also like to see access to the chrome.  </s>
<s> I just don't believe it belongs *inside* the DOM.  </s>
<s> Indeed, I wonder how many of these "application architectures" are web based and thus, I wish the DOM working group, and PF would step back and look at all the possible web based applications of DOM, and what would happen if DOM followed the data model of the MVC (model, view, controller paradigm) rather than be extended endlessly to handle each and every new need/requirement.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I'm hung up on semantics here, and maybe the DOM working group's idea about extending the DOM to include the chrome is really creating the "view and controller".  </s>
<s> If so, then my conerns are not as serious.  </s>
<s> However, I don't understand things to be that way, and as they say, "I think the cat got out of the bag", when DOM2 included Events.  </s>
<s> If DOM3 is really going to address accessibility, and work in the future, with all these applications and devices, which we have yet to develop, now is the time to look at these things.  </s>
<s> Regards Mark  </s>
<s> also, while i support most of what the UA group has said about supporting DOM, i am not in favor of adding the chrome (UI) to DOM.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, DOM should remain the "clean" data model of the MVC (model, view, controller paradigm).  </s>
<s> If the DOM is "extended" to somehow include the chrome, then the "method of this extension" is my concern.  </s>
<s> mark  </s>
<s> Peter, Mark and Rich, The W3C WAI User Agent guidelines are going to be in Candidate Recommendation within a day or two.  </s>
<s> Part of the goal of our candidate recommendation period is to discuss the use of the DOM with AT vendors for assistive technologies to provide alternative access to WWW content.  </s>
<s> We hope to gain their support in using the DOM as the primary way to provide an exchange of WWW content between user agents and assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> We have tenatively scheduled this meeting for 18 Feburary at 2:00 EST.  </s>
<s> I would like to invite all of you to participate in this teleconference and was wondering about your availability and interest in attending at the tenative date and time.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Jon  </s>
<s> We talked about this at the ftf in Austin; the possibility of removing the DOM-specific part and making it a general requirement for exchange of content, with the DOM being one possible solution.  </s>
<s> Those at the ftf meeting felt the DOM was important enough to stand out.  </s>
<s> - Ian  </s>
<s> Mark, The only real discussion about DOM in the current UA guidelines is for the full implementation of DOM level 1 to provide access to the content.  </s>
<s> This is a big enough problem for the working groups and developers right now.  </s>
<s> The idea of adding chrome to the DOM is an idea of interest to the current UA group, but it really will not effect the current guidelines.  </s>
<s> Our biggest job right now is educating of AT developers of the DOM capabilities and encouraging them to support the use of DOM to access content.  </s>
<s> This support should be based on having access to information they do not have right now through other means or it will be easier to get the information through DOM.  </s>
