A little knowledge can be dangerous. 
I have a few of the basics down when it comes to making my pages accessible (i.e. always include ALT descriptions with images, use STRONG instead of B , etc.), and because of this, I've been asked to explain a little about accessibility to some web-design students. 
(These students, themselves, have physical disabilities, though as far as I know, none of them are blind.) 
I'm looking for a crash-course and/or a place on the Net where I can direct the students to help them learn more about creating web-accessible pages. 
Basically, what they (I) would need is a straight-forward list of the tags and extra info required for html. 
At this point, it isn't necessary to get into things like Java, stylesheets, imagemaps, forms, etc. 
I know many of you will direct me to the W3C site, but even that gets a little bogged down in terminology foreign to beginners. 
Is there something simpler, a little more stripped down?

You're welcome to use the course I prepared, Kristopher: I made it precisely because the WAI guidelines are rather thick for the folks I help. 
Soon, I plan to revise the site because of things I have learned in the past few months (it needs to be even simpler and more to the point, I think), and it would be helpful to hear your (and your students') reaction to it. 
Hope that helps, - tom

You might try the Web Design Group reference at or I find that to be pretty user-friendly.

I have a list of elements with the things you need to think about when using them at http://saltimbocca.srl.rmit.edu.au/WAI/mygl.htm 
It is part of stuff I did for the OzEWAI CD-ROM produced in September. 
It also includes some bits of tutorials I wrote on HTML which have accessibility as one of the underlying assumptions. 
The CD is for sale for AUD$20, but not (so far) by credit card. 
I guess if you sent USD$20 they would send a CD back, the exchange rate being what it is, but they are unlikely to be interested in a cheque drawn agains a US bank... Charles McCathieNevile
