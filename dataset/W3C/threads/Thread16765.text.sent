* For any page that has a significantly concrete concept whose understanding can be enhanced with a visual element, auditory element, or interactive process to enhance understanding provide: a graphic illustration, and/or an audio clip, and/or, a virtual simulation and/or, a video, and/or link to content that contains illustrations of the concrete concept. 
A concrete concept is a person, place or thing. 
For example, an animal, a plant, or a product. 
It can also stand for a class of nouns - cats, birds, computers, mountains, hotel rooms. 
* For a page that describes an organization or concept for which there is a well known symbol or logo, include that symbol or logo in the content or link to content that contains the symbol or logo. 
These lists of highly specific defined terms and cases are ridiculous and entirely unhelpful. 
If you demand illustrations, "concrete concepts" (an oxymoron) are not the only thing requiring illustration. 
The entire enterprise of selecting just these terms here and there as a focus, and the even more risible attempts to define them, bring the Guidelines into disrepute. 
It is absurd to provide this level of specificity. 
* When referencing sounds, link to a clip of the sound. 
This too has not been thought out properly as it applies to real-world Web sites. 
Apart from issues of programming complexity, server load, authoring-tool rights, and simple common sense, here's a question for you: If I write about "Vasoline" by the Stone Temple Pilots, do I have to provide a 3 MB MP3 of that song on my piddling little server with its piddling little bandwidth? 
I mean, it's a sound, right? 
Next you'll be telling us "When referencing cuisine, prepare actual food for tasting." 
Oh, and by the way, "reference" isn't a verb. 
I'm sure Gregg will dig up some dictionary definitions to prove it is.

Joel Sanda JS Well ... what good is a checklist if it isn't specific? 
You can't "check" items on a "list" if they're not there. 
When you make a shopping list do you say "dairy", "grain", and "protein"? 
When you plan a vacation do you say "Western Hemisphere"? 
When you write a book about web accessibility and don't give "highly specific defined terms and cases" will anyone be able to use it if it is a generalized description of ill-defined terms and ideas? 
Concepts can be clearly defined and self-evident (like "obsessif-curmudgeon") or they can be not clearly defined and not self-evident (like "dermatology fetishist"). 
A concrete concept is one that leaves little doubt as to its meaning and purpose. 
Another illustration: the concept "journalist". 
Why that could mean just about anyone with a pencil and paper or keyboard and modem these days. 
JC: If I write about "Vasoline" by the Stone Temple Pilots, do I have to provide a 3 MB MP3 of that song on my piddling little server with its piddling little bandwidth? 
JS: No, and I think I took care of that sort of interpretation when I suggested the guidelines instruct the developer to ensure the additional non-text element contribute to the understanding of the material. 
For example, adding a picture to illustrate the phrase "dermatology fetishist" would probably interest more people than a picture illustrating the phrase "obsessif-curmudgeon". 
JC: I mean, it's a sound, right? 
JS: Yes, it is, but it's other things, as well. 
A bunch of words in a book doesn't make it a book - it's just a bunch of words, right? 
JC: you'll be telling us "When referencing cuisine, prepare actual food for tasting." 
JS: Actually, I'd suggest a picture. 
However, if you're roasting wild pig on the beach with a bunch of boisterous people partying a sound clip of the event may also be pleasing to the listener. 
Depending upon who is doing the talking, of course. 
These lists of highly specific defined terms and cases are ridiculous and entirely unhelpful. 
Are you suggesting that it is clear to people already what content needs to be illustrated and what doesn't, or that the whole enterprise is impossible at any level and that there is therefore no point in trying? 
If you demand illustrations, "concrete concepts" (an oxymoron) are not the only thing requiring illustration. 
Correct. 
Perhaps you could enlighten us by explaining what other things require illustration. 
The entire enterprise of selecting just these terms here and there as a focus, and the even more risible attempts to define them, bring the Guidelines into disrepute. 
It is absurd to provide this level of specificity. 
I suspect we haven't got the balance correct yet. 
On the other hand, your comments below would suggest that without a bit more specificity people will do some fairly unhelpful things for lack of understanding.

(Aside: the size of your personal equipment doesn't make much difference to the needs of other people - although it obviously has an impact on your ability to provide for those needs. 
In a perfect world people would have all the resources they nneed to produce accessible content, but it is beyond the scope of this group to decide how to solve problems of resource allocation, such as what constitutes an undue burden.) 
Well, that is approximately the equivalent of providing the following alt text for the W3C logo that appears on each page: The World Wide Web Consortium's logo. 
It consists of the letter "W" (capitalised) kerned with the numeral 3, both in a sky blue colour, and followed by the letter "C" (also capitalised) which is presented as a white letter over a black letter slightly displaced to give a sort of shadow effect on the white background of the logo. 
The "W3C" is centred, taking approximately one third of the space, and is followed by a small (about one quarter font size) symbol that this is a registered mark - in this case the symbol of a capital letter "R" enlosed in a circle, in black. 
The font used for all characters is SomeFont, and the top and bottom borders of the image are thin black lines. 
(If you would have provided an alt text like that for a logo, please don't. 
It is appropriate for a long description, but inappropriate for an alt). 
Perhaps your writing skill is sufficient to convey the musical feel of the song "Vasoline" (I presume it is spelled like that to avoid infinging a trade mark), but in general there will be many people who will be much better able to convey a sense of the music by including a short excerpt. 
My advice would be that they should use a fairly low quality version to ensure a small download is required. 
I also recognise that not everyone is going to make the effort to make their content accessible, but it is helpful if we describe how they should proceed if they do want to make that effort, and what groups of people will not be able to use their content if they don't. 
It seems that we need to work out how to provide fairly specific advice, just as we needed to do in the case of text equivalents, if we are hoping that your hypothetical misunderstanding is to be avoided. 
Cheers Charles Unfortunately JC's original article was given out of context, so I'm guessing that this is a new set of draft guidelines. 
I don't know what conformance level is being talked about here. 
However, it seems to me that to conform to this level you have to have the resources of a prime time television production company and that your audience needs to have TV type bandwidth (and you must have many times that bandwidth). 
Even to do this legally is going to cost huge amounts of time and considerable money in obtaining copyright clearances, trademark clearances, (without prejudice to their legal necessesity) permissions to link to sites, recording engineers fees, etc. (A large number of amateur sites are almost certainly in breach of intellectual property rights in the illustrative material they use, but W3C cannot officially countenance such breaches.) 
As I say, you are talking of TV programme production costs, not even just magazine article production costs. 
Even relatively traditional media is poor at illustrating concepts; they are much more likely to use an easy to obtain stock photograph to illustrate easy features, basically as eye candy, than to commission new material for the really difficult bits. 
As quoted, there also seems to be an indication of putting everything immediately on display on the page. 
This seems to me to be the opposite of the fundamental web concept, which is that you link to material. 
Once you link to material, you can use other people's material (but note that the cover story for one e-business magazine here in the UK, this week, is that commercial sites are afraid of linking even to home pages, because of the legal risks involved). 
This is ear candy. 
It's unlikely to meet the requirement of adding understanding. 
It's also sort of thing that a glossy site producer would do without prompting if the perceived technical, financial and time scale constraints permitted it. 
By perceived technical constraints, I include the need to use HTML; HTML was not designed as a multimedia language and should only be used to link together true multimedia (computer) lnaguages, where they are needed. 
To a non-literate, user, the sound carries the message "might be a barbecue", whereas even a picture would carry the equivalent of many words of much higher quality information (if it was a picture of the event, not a stock picture). 
I'd say the sizzling sound has more to do with maintainig the "viewer's" attention and pure entertainment, than to actually communicating. 
That again is something that advertising agencies do without prompting. 
This is still going to put you into a high risk area with respect to intellectual property rights. 
The copyright owners may not be prepared to license the use of reduced quality material, or may only be prepared to license it (one service offering aerial photographs of the UK, will only grant a licence for web use if the quality of the image is degraded; this is a paid licence, which is stiil too expensive for amateur use). 
Also, and noting that I am not a lawyer, because the ability to include sound was limited to a few organisations until recently, I doubt that there is much case law on what constitutes "fair use" (a concept that is not well defined at the best of times). 
One of the "fair use" permissions (UK at least) is for criticism and review, but I'm not sure that a clip simply to identify the material would fall under that permission and what is permissible for more explicit criticism and review probably hasn't been well defined yet. 
It's also possible that using low quality material might compromise a "fair use" defence. 
I'd therefore suggest that any inclusion of any part of this track would need a written copyright clearance, or insurance against legal risks. 
Why not a link to the performer's page - many of which have song samples on the page. 
That won't pose copyright concerns and will keep the page uncluttered. 
The first bullet in 3.4 allows us to "provide a graphic equivalent or link to content that contains a graphic equivalent". 
Can we specify linking to any alternative content - not just graphics?

This is regrettably becoming a gray area. 
A number of commercial web sites already forbid deep links and attempt to restrict the ways in which home page links are presented. 
This is obviously contradictory to the web, but commercial sites are normally not web sites but rather "web browser viewed" sites. 
As I mentioned in another reply, the dangers of linking to other sites is the cover story on the current issue of one UK e-business magazine. 
Using anything other than a straight, unframed, a element (or, though I don't reccommend this, location.href=/location.replace) 
reference will normally be considered tantamount to creating a derived work by the company lawyers, whatever the actual copyright law status. 
bgsound/embed from the band's site is a no-no without explicit permission. 
In a commercial world, it seems unavoidable that embedding will be brought under copyright law, if not already the case. 
Deep linking is more of a problem; the web is severely compromised without deep linking, but many business models are dependent on going through home pages. 
What I would hope for is some sort of compromise in which sites must actively indicate++ that a page may not be deep linked before there is any protection. 
I would hope that home page linking could be made something that couldn't be excluded, but I could see, for example, the band wanting the ability to prevent links to its site from critical sites, or sites incompatible with their image. 
I have no problems with generalising this point. 
++ This needs to be done with HTTP delivered meta data. 
Refer based methods are vulnerable to forgery and cause conflicts with privacy requirements as some people use bogus Referer headers, or none at all, to prevent click trailing. 
Whilst a commercial site may make the ability to click trail a condition of access, one doesn't want to couple this with deep linking restrictions. 
The meta data must be delivered at the HTTP level (although many people seem unaware of how to set HTTP meta data) because the resource may not be HTML (e.g. it may be a sound file). 
The problem with only linking to the content is that fails to achieve the purpose of having the content there in the first place - to enable someone who cannot easily understand a plain text page to have an idea of the main topics of that page. 
I recognise that there are concerns such as copyright and trademarking, and in some areas (like where I live) of bandwidth. 
There are emerging technologies in the area of the semantic Web that we should expect to use in the medium term (several years before I imagine it being deployed in browsers that have been spread into schools for example) which will provide much easier techniques for doing this. 
In the meantime, we are still struggling to get the principles in an agreed explanation, so we may find the technology overtakes us in development pace. 
Without agreed principles, or even well-expressed ones that are there as straw-man proposals, we are several steps away from being ready to address concerns of whether implementation details are so important as to negate the principle.

Joel How'd this end up on the IG list? 
I mean, we're still discussing a draft of version 2 of WCAG, right? 
My intent is not to exclude anyone on IG from participating -- after all, the WCAG archives are public -- but thought there was a specific working group mailing list for a reason. 
Among other reasons, it's very confusing for the more general audiences of WAI-IG to be "presented" with stuff about 3.4 (when WCAG version 1's 3.4 isn't what we're talking about), especially when it is still very much in a "rough draft" stage. 
Going to IG for feedback on proposals makes sense -- but not at a point in which the WCAG working group has yet to arrive at a concrete proposal, and not without giving IG a solid enough intro to the issues so that they'd be able to contribute if they hadn't been following the working group discussion. 
This is my long way of saying: Let's use the right mailing lists, folks.

TAKE CONTROL. 
The advantage of only linking is that it forces one to consider relevance. 
Embedding encourages the use of decorative material, whereas out of line material has to be of real relevance, otherwise people will not follow the links. 
If they can only get an idea of the topics, they may well be in the wrong place. 
There is still a strong case for presenting completely different material to people with different intellectual levels or background knowledge, and, in many cases different organisations may be best suited to communicating at the different levels. 
It can even be dangerous to get a partial understanding (there are many examples, but, for example CPR applied inappropriately can kill). 
I haven't read the source documents on the semantic web, but from what has been presented by its proponents on the various mailing lists, I think it will be considered strictly for academics by commercial web site authors; most govermental site authors follow commercial site practice rather than thinking from first principles. 
Remember that commercial web sites are advertising, and modern advertising has very little to do with communicating information. 
The main long term constraint is not so much technology as the cost of entry in terms of assembling a multi-disciplinary team to create a small web site. 
Given that I treat accessibility as being more than just accessibility for physically and mentally disabled, there is a danger that you will be denying accessibility to publish. 
Right. 
I guess the thread got cross-posted somewhere, which is generally poor list etiquette. 
In particular W3C mailing lists are archived, so if there is one public archive it is helpful not to remove the discussion to a different forum, but if relevant to provide a pointer in that other forum.

CMN Yes, but this is not in any way restricted to the use of multimedia - this applies for all content. 
The trick is to have the right balance of between what is included and what is linked. 
DJW If they can only get an idea of the topics, they may well be in the wrong place.

CMN There are cases where presenting multiple forms of content are important, and as you say there are cases where it needs to be done right. 
(CPR is only meant to be used on people who are effectively dead, by people who _might_ be able to save them). 
But there are many more cases where extending access to information is not dangerous, but helpful. 
Certainly WCAG techniques need to deal with multiple versions of content, but situational restrictions are the responsibility of individual content producers, and they should get their information from appropriate sources (copyright is another example of something that has relationships in implementation but is beyond the scope of WCAG).

CMN What we will be doing is denying that content is accessible just because it was the best that some team managed to produce, and actually pointing out what it needs to do in order to achieve "complete" accessibility (well, that is probably impossible, but the closer we get to that goal the better in terms of what we are trying to do here).
