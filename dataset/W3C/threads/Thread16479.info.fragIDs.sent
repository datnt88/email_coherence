Hi all, We have just re-designed our usability infocentre with accessibility as a major criteria in the brief. 
As far as we can tell, we think that it is WAI P3 compliant but we don't want to make a big deal of this, or mistakenly make the claim because some of the priority 3 points are somewhat subjective. 
While I realise that this request is somewhat off topic for this board, I'd be grateful if anyone was to take a look at the site and tell us if you think it is P3 compliant.

Hi, there are some errors I picked up using the W3C validator - the following link will give you the results (warning long URI): Main problems I saw were some missing alt attributes (which probably should have been blank - alt="") and no headings to give an idea of the structure. 
Like the content though.

Hi Charles, Thanks for your feedback. 
I have to admit that we were initially pretty embarrassed about the missing alt attributes when we got your mail. 
In fairness, it's the cardinal sin. 
Anyway, we re-traced our steps in the design process to figure out how me let such a seemingly obvious "mistake" slip through. 
Our reasoning raises some interesting questions. 
Here's what happened: The missing alt attributes were image links which were associated with text links. 
In our case, these are screen shots of websites and software interfaces we review, etc. Originally, we had alt text attributed to the images. 
However, because the alt text was the same as the link text, the screen reader was simply repeating itself all the way down the right hand column. 
This was accessible, but previous experience and testing with people who use screen readers has shown us that this repetition of information is very tedious, so... 
We inserted a null value in the alt attribute. 
But the images are links, and that means the screen reader 'calls' a link but provides no supporting information. 
Also, we wanted to keep the images as links for people who don't use screen readers, so... 
We combined the actual text and image within the link tags, to create a 
single link entity which was comprised of the link text and the image. 
In 
that way the screen reader we use for testing (JAWS 3.7) simply reads the link once and does not pick up the image. 
Perfect! 
But... 
When we took this step, we discarded the alt attribute altogether. 
We didn't think of testing with Bobby (or any other automated validator) seeing as it worked on the screen reader - after all, our original solution would have been passed by Bobby, despite being somewhat tedious. 
However, we should have thought to retain the alt attribute, with a null value, even if it made no difference on JAWS 3.7. 
We would be interested to know if combining the text and image link as one 
entity without using the alt attribute, works on other screen readers - if anyone can let us know if it definitely doesn't work on older readers, please let us know. 
Either way... 
We have added the alt-text - better safe than sorry. 
On the subject of the other errors raised by the W3C validator, we're rolling up the proverbial sleeves... Again, thanks for the comments.

Anthony, thanks for explaining how this happens. 
I guess one of the useful things that we can do is identify the kinds of problems that people can face when implementing this stuff. 
I would generally recommend checking with as many automated tools as you can, not because they are enough to solve the problem but because they pick up a lot of stuff that can easily slip through a manual review - the fiddly little code bits that the tools should take care of. 
Just for the validator, if you have a javascript-capable browser you can use a bookmarklet to get a validation and an outline of any page, which is a simple, useful check. 
Add the following to your bookmarks: (long javascript URI) javascript:void(location.href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri='+escape(document.URL)+'&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;outline=') cheers Charles McCN Hi Charles, Thanks for your feedback.

Yes this is a good technique. 
In Home Page Reader, it depends which settings are set. 
In default mode, only image links missing alt attributes are spoken with the URL of the link. 
In "verbose mode", all images, not just the linked ones, are spoken with the source attribute of the image element. 
Regards, Phill 
agree. 
Lynx does the same thing.
