<s> Hi Charles, Thanks for your feedback.  </s>
<s> I have to admit that we were initially pretty embarrassed about the missing alt attributes when we got your mail.  </s>
<s> In fairness, it's the cardinal sin.  </s>
<s> Anyway, we re-traced our steps in the design process to figure out how me let such a seemingly obvious "mistake" slip through.  </s>
<s> Our reasoning raises some interesting questions.  </s>
<s> Here's what happened: The missing alt attributes were image links which were associated with text links.  </s>
<s> In our case, these are screen shots of websites and software interfaces we review, etc. Originally, we had alt text attributed to the images.  </s>
<s> However, because the alt text was the same as the link text, the screen reader was simply repeating itself all the way down the right hand column.  </s>
<s> This was accessible, but previous experience and testing with people who use screen readers has shown us that this repetition of information is very tedious, so...  </s>
<s> We inserted a null value in the alt attribute.  </s>
<s> But the images are links, and that means the screen reader 'calls' a link but provides no supporting information.  </s>
<s> Also, we wanted to keep the images as links for people who don't use screen readers, so...  </s>
<s> We combined the actual text and image within the link tags, to create a  </s>
<s> single link entity which was comprised of the link text and the image.  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> that way the screen reader we use for testing (JAWS 3.7) simply reads the link once and does not pick up the image.  </s>
<s> Perfect!  </s>
<s> But...  </s>
<s> When we took this step, we discarded the alt attribute altogether.  </s>
<s> We didn't think of testing with Bobby (or any other automated validator) seeing as it worked on the screen reader - after all, our original solution would have been passed by Bobby, despite being somewhat tedious.  </s>
<s> However, we should have thought to retain the alt attribute, with a null value, even if it made no difference on JAWS 3.7.  </s>
<s> We would be interested to know if combining the text and image link as one  </s>
<s> entity without using the alt attribute, works on other screen readers - if anyone can let us know if it definitely doesn't work on older readers, please let us know.  </s>
<s> Either way...  </s>
<s> We have added the alt-text - better safe than sorry.  </s>
<s> On the subject of the other errors raised by the W3C validator, we're rolling up the proverbial sleeves... Again, thanks for the comments.  </s>

<s> Anthony, thanks for explaining how this happens.  </s>
<s> I guess one of the useful things that we can do is identify the kinds of problems that people can face when implementing this stuff.  </s>
<s> I would generally recommend checking with as many automated tools as you can, not because they are enough to solve the problem but because they pick up a lot of stuff that can easily slip through a manual review - the fiddly little code bits that the tools should take care of.  </s>
<s> Just for the validator, if you have a javascript-capable browser you can use a bookmarklet to get a validation and an outline of any page, which is a simple, useful check.  </s>
<s> Add the following to your bookmarks: (long javascript URI) javascript:void(location.href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri='+escape(document.URL)+'&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;outline=') cheers Charles McCN Hi Charles, Thanks for your feedback.  </s>
