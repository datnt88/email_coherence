When I build the latest tidy release, I am seeing the following: $ make $ ./tidy 
-e  release-notes.html 
Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing console input (stdin) stdin: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" stdin: Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional no warnings or errors were found Can anyone tell me why the two lines labeled "stdin:" are being produced? 
When I read this, it seems to me that tidy is reporting a discrepancy, even though it explicitly states that no warnings or errors were found.

Even if explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should be construed as representing my employer's opinions. 
- - And if i have a very strict conforming XHTML 1.0 document Tidy tells me its Transitional and changes the Doctype :-( regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann ?

I can confirm this, Tidy seems to ALWAYS set XHTML 1.0 Transitional for output-xhtml: yes, even when it correctly recognized HTML 4.01 Strict or HTML 4.01 Frameset before... Sebastian Lange Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML 4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes. 
Courtesy to Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy: Tidy your documents ONLINE: I have just checked and found that is mapped to XHTML 1.0 strict while is mapped to XHTML 1.0 transitional, which is correct. 
Do you have any simple test cases where Tidy is doing the wrong thing on this?

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) One quick example, before I go home: ... but Tidy sets DOCTYPE "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN". 
For more examples I'll have to do a litte resarch, that'll have to wait till next week though. 
Have a nice weekend!

Courtesy to Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy: Tidy your documents ONLINE: Hello Dave, I found another example of Tidy setting an inappropriate XHTML TRANSITIONAL doctype: "A Reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0" [http://www.w3.org/TR/html/] is a valid XHTML 1.0 Strict document [http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fhtml%2F], but Tidy incorrectly recognizes it as Transitional and changes the doctype accordingly: sebastian
