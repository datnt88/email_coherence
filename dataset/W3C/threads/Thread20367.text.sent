Amaya automatically adds a stroke attribute to things (v4.3.1) if I remove it. 
this is annoying. 
I am not sure if it overrides relevant CSS - doesn't seem too, but still it would be nice if it didn't do that.

Are you sure you're using a standard version. 
Yes. release 4.3.1 for windows 98. 
If I remove the stroke attribute on an element, then select the element and do something to it, it adds stroke="1" again.
