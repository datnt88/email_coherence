I am one of those people, like many here I'm sure, that dislike Internet Explorer immensely. 
[*raises hand*] While our reasons for disliking the browser may vary from personal choice to anti-ms zealotry, it must be said that writing browsers which adhere to the World Wide Web Consortiums HTML standards, is simply a step backwards in the lopsided browser war. 
Simply put, IE has set the standard already. 
Whatever Microsoft defines as the HTML standard should be adopted as the de facto standard. 
Building a tree-fort and writing up our own standard that is "better" than the Microsoft way, can be fun and even noble, but in the end it is totally irrelevant. 
As it stands now, MS has won. 
They own at least 80% of the browser share. 
Actually it's more like 96%, according to my server logs. 
This dictates how web sites are designed and developed, most of which will try hard to satisfy IE first and WC3 browsers second. 
Now yes, most large commercial sites will accommodate multiple browsers, but these are certainly the minority of web sites that exist. 
The rest of the personal/web log/specific niche interest sites will be the majority, and it should be assumed that since these are made by amateurs, (who probably run IE), they will be designed for IE. 
This is because designing a site to comply with WC3 standards is too hard for the average user putting up a page about his He-Man figurines. 
You can't "throw together" a WC3 compliant page like you can for Internet Explorer. 
Instead, you have to contend with CSS style sheets with multiple classes, which most people will not want, have the time, or capacity to deal with. 
I would argue that people change their browsers because their online friends recommend them to. 
I would argue that the vast majority *never* changes their browser. 
They use the browser that comes with their computer or that their ISP provides for them. 
Speaking of ISPs, AOL -- the world's largest ISP -- has already switched its Compuserve and AOL/Mac OS X customers from IE to Gecko (Mozilla's W3C-complaint, non-IE-emulating rendering engine). 
Why would they do that if not to test the technology before unleashing it on their AOL/Win customers? 
AOL has more than 35 *million* subscribers. 
That's more than most web sites can afford to ignore. 
These social groups will have the same interests, and enjoy the same pages as each other, and may often have their own sites reflecting the groups interests. 
Most likely they will probably never use a WC3 browser over IE, because the sites they collectively visit and write will render best under Internet Explorer, thus limiting the adoption of better browsers like Opera and K-Meleon. 
How many sites on the Internet render fine under IE versus Mozilla and Opera? 
I'm guessing IE holds a considerable lead, if not 99% compliance for up-to-date pages, versus a 70% for the others. 
In conclusion, the other browsers that fight for the remaining 20% of the web surfing pubic, must attempt to emulate Internet Explorer's rendering and HTML standards as much as possible. 
Many sites do something like if (document.all) 
doStuffSpecificallyTaileredToMsiesCssBugs; else doStuffWhichWillWorkInW3cCompliantBrowsers; If other browsers were to implement document.all, 
they would also have to emulate all of the weird bugs of IE5/Win. 
Given the enormous amount of bugs we're talking about here, that would be an impossible goal. 
It would mean either attempting to reverse-engineer the IE rendering engine or writing literally *millions* of test pages. 
Also, which specific MSIE is it that you would like the other browsers to emulate? 
IE5/Win? 
IE6/Win? 
IE5/Mac? 
'Cause guess what: They all render pages *differently*. 
This is the only viable way to offer the public a better web browsing experience than the one currently offered by Microsoft. 
By refusing to adhere to this idea, and continuing to adopt WC3 standards, these browsers are effectively signing their own death certificates and at the same time, an open invitation to Microsoft to continue its colonization of the Internet. 
*Emulating IE* would be an open invitation to Microsoft continue its colonization of the Internet! 
It would be mean that Microsoft would forever be in control of the web. 
All non-IE browsers would forever be forced play catch-up with the latest IE. 
The only way out of this nightmare is W3C standards. 
/Jonas (posting from netscape.public.mozilla.browser, 
and CC'ing public-evangelist@w3.org.) 'Open Systems' means no fences. 
And no fences means no use for Gates. 
- Sun Microsystems Sorry, that should have read "It would mean that Microsoft [...]". 
Ignore the "be". 
/Jonas 'Open Systems' means no fences. 
And no fences means no use for Gates. 
- Sun Microsystems Other sites may tell a different story: http://www.hacksrus.com/reports/log.agents.html . 
In the group to which I belong at Netscape, where we're involved in standards support, we recommend that site authors who need object detection do the following: if (document.getElementById) 
doStuffThatWillWorkInW3CCompliantBrowsers; else if (document.all) 
doStuffTailoredForIE4.x; 
else if (document.layers) 
doStuffTailoredForNN4.x; 
else warningMessageAboutLostFunctionality; ...or something like that. 
The point it that we tell them to detect for the W3C DOM detection first, because more browsers support it. 
Then the fallbacks come. 
This assumes that they feel a need to even have the fallbacks, which most commercial site developers do. 
It's a small performance win in standards-compliant browsers, too, since the first test is to recognize them. 
You can shortcut the rest of the testing branches that way. 
In some cases that can actually have a perceivable effect on performance. 
See for example the rather lengthy discussion contained in http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154589 . 
Indeed so.
