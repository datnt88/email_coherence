Does the HTML, or other spec, state anything about whether absolute or relative paths should be used in, e.g., HREFs for content local to that web site. 
Using relative paths allows the downloading of a set of pages so that they may be used without being connect to the internet. 
Either way of writing URL references is valid, and which one is better depends on your site structure, for example I personally favour using absolute paths for content in another branch of the site tree, instead of using ../../../../../otherbranch/index.html from one file and ../../../../../../otherbranch/index.html from another. 
Depends on how clever the program downloading the files is, it may be able to replace paths, for example with Netscape you can get paths changed by editing the page, then saving it locally.

If not present in IE, then I'd suggest that Tidy provide such an option.
