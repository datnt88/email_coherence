Is there anything in the DOM spec regarding "reading" or "parsing" a DTD or somehow checking whether an Element is valid in the context of the DTD before adding it to a Document?

Take a look at the DOM Level 3 Abstract Schemas spec. 
The functionality that you're interested in is in the document-editing section.
