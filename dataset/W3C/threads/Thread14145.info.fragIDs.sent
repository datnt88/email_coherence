PRI-10 Abbreviations and acronyms G. Vanderheiden's summary: "4.2 Specify the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms. 
[Priority 2 for the first occurrence of the acronym or abbreviation in a given document, Priority 3 thereafter.]" 
"An AC Member felt that to expand abbreviations and acronyms is good writing style. 
They did not feel that this checkpoint was an accessibility issue. 
They knew of no user agents that support the ACRONYM or ABBR tag. 
As a result they felt that to should be priority 3. "This is a similar situation as PRI -9. 
Should an item be required before it is supported by user agents? 
This would help solve legacy problems in the future. 
But how much should it be required today?" 
My response: I essentially agree with the commenter. 
My comments are as follows: {EH: Delete this. 
I think (4/23/99, added word "think") that this checkpoint is a "poison pill" that, while seemingly innocuous, places an untenable burden upon the Web developer. 
I think that it will discourage an inordinate number of people from striving for triple-AAA compliance and maybe the other compliance levels. 
If it must be retained, I suggest the following change: 4.2 Specify the expansion of first use of abbreviations and acronyms within a document. 
[Priority 3] For example, in HTML, use the "title" attribute of the ABBR and ACRONYM elements. 
One can provide the expansion (especially of the first occurrence) in the main body of the document. 
Or one can link to a glossary (within the document or another document) that provides the expansion{EH: 4/27/99} Techniques for checkpoint 4.2} {EH: Old.

Should an item be required before it is implemented by user agents? 
Yes, it should. 
In addition it should be required from user agents before it is used by content providers. 
If the answer was no we wouldn't have HTML4.0 but only HTML2.0 and 3.2 which attempted to cover the current support in most user agents. 
HTML4.0 is a coordination device that helps content providers to predict what user agents will support and browser vendors what content providers will provide.

The problem with ACRONYM is that there is no longer any agreement on what the term means, as was brought home to me only too clearly when the drafts for HTML4.0 were being discussed. 
According to Modern English Usage 2nd edition, an acronym is a pronounceable word formed from the initial letters of a phrase. 
Thus, a speaking machine presented with ACRONYM UNESCO / knows that it is expected to pronounce these initials as a word, instead of spelling them out as initial letters as with ABBREV IBM / . 
Do authors agree? 
Absolutely not. 
They now use the term "acronym" to refer to any kind of initialism, whether normally pronounced or whether spelled out. 
And so, the markup seems to have become useless.

The emphasis on "pronouncable" acronyms is news to me. 
In the computing field, at least, there are many acronyms which may be annunciated as a single word or individual letters, depending on the speaker's preference. 
For example "SQL," the acronym/abbreviation for "Structured Query Language," may be pronouced as the English word "sequel" or spelled out aloud as "S Q L." The preference seems to have more to do with syllable conservation than anything else. 
I would never consider "IBM" to be an abbreviation, only an acronym, pronouncable as a word or not. 
What of "words" which are formed from only part of the full word, such as "Co." for "Copyright," or "Mr." for "Mister?" 
This is clearly an abbreviation, not an acronym. 
And these abbreviations are never spelled out, but pronounced in full! 
The opposite of "Modern English Usage."

I had written: 
No Sir, it isn't "news", it's an old fact. 
The term "acronym" was specifically coined for this purpose. 
There was already a word, "initialism", for an abbreviation that is formed from the initial letters of a phrase without reference to whether it is pronounced or spelled out. 
But that term, "initialism", has remained rather a specialist usage, and, as your reaction has demonstrated, the "news" is that the word "acronym" has now lost its specific meaning, and has to be interpreted as a synonym of "initialism". 
The conclusion seems to be that we no longer have a word that unambiguously means "an initialism that is meant to be pronounced as a word". 
Of course: that was not in dispute. 
Yes, but as they are neither acronyms (by either meaning of the term) nor initialisms, they are outside the scope of the current discussion. 
No. I don't understand what you're trying to prove by this assertion, but unless it has some significance for the business of this group, I'd respectfully suggest we not pursue that. 
The only point I was trying to make was this. 
I look in my reference works (dictionary, MEU2 etc.), and they tell me that acronyms are defined to be pronounceable, You may also refer to The HTML4.0 spec doesn't itself attempt to define the term "acronym": it gives two examples that are pronounceable, and hence conform to the original definition, but then wrecks the effect by stating 'Western languages make extensive use of acronyms such as "GmbH"...' - referring to an unpronounceable initialism, not an acronym in the original sense of the term. 
The HTML4.0 spec goes on to say: "When necessary, authors should use style sheets to specify the pronunciation of an abbreviated form." 
This now seems inevitable, as we seem to have concluded that no useful guidance can be deduced from the fact that the markup chose ACRONYM rather than ABBR. 
A pity. Best regards
