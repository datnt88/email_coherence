<s> Hello all, I have a rather interesting question to pose, and it is one that I cannot seem to find a definitive answer for.  </s>
<s> Can anyone on the list provide me with some help with the following question?  </s>
<s> Which is best for accessibility: HTML 4.x or XHTML standards?  </s>
<s> IF anyone knows if there is an answer to this then is it also possible to scour everyone's brains for reasons why one is preferred above another.  </s>

<s> my answers are never very authoritative, however i imagine that in an ideal world xhtml will be more accessible, as xml is the future, and xhtml is a step in the direction of xml.  </s>
<s> My most serious concern regarding xhtml, and xml (and this future), is that code that has errors will not be rendered, try amaya.  </s>
<s> This is bl*** awful for anyone with dyslexia, learning difficulties, DTs, typos or other problems, as most would I think prefer some page rather than no page.  </s>

<s> Why? The author may be using some AT which corrects for errors, either as a deliberate useful activity (after all users are not interested in if a page has errors they're interested in viewing the content.) or as an aside to solving a different access need.  </s>
<s> I don't believe there's any option but to use html 4.01, xhtml of any flavour should be served as application/xhtml+xml and only 1 flavour may be served as text/html and even then it remains broken to many user agents.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
