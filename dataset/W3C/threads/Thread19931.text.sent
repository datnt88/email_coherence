Internet Explorer 5 and Netscape Navigator 4 already handle appropriately documents that declare a UTF-8 charset. 
Try http://cuisung.unige.ch/prod/TestAlpha.html to test your platform. 
On my Sun workstation with X11R6 and Netscape 4.05 or 4.7, I can see the latin, greek, cyrillic, japanese (both Hiragana and Katakana) and hangul alphabets plus the math signs. 
On my Win'98 pc with IE5 and the complete multi-lingual support installed, I can see the hebrew, arabic and thai alphabets as well. 
As for HTML editors supporting Unicode/UTF-8, Front Page Express generates correct UTF-8 sequences when you switch to non-latin character sets and PageCraft generates the correct Unicode values in &amp;#xxxx; entities. 
PageMill, Netscape Composer, AOLpress, Adobe GoLive and, for the moment, Amaya don't seem to support "foreign" alphabets.

There are very few Unicode encoded fonts, and I doubt there are any UTF-8 encoded fonts; But you still need Unicode encoded fonts. 
The font that covers the most useful maths characters on MS platforms is Symbol, which is not Unicode encoded. 
Windows NT 4 comes with Lucida Sans Unicode, which does have Unicode encoded maths symbols, but there is only that one font; it is far from a complete Unicode font. 
Presumably for marketing reasons, Windows 9x doesn't include this font, although you might be able to get CJK fonts for the browsers (LSU doesn't include CJK). 
Office 2000 will reportedly include a nearly complete Unicode font, but that is not being offered as a free upgrade, presumably again for marketing reasons. 
IE5 can only map fonts by language (really meaning source character set) and has no obvious provision for assigning a font for maths use (most maths symbols are probably currently entered by abusing font selections to select the non-Unicode Symbol Arial Unicode MS, which comes with Office 2000, includes a complete (I believe) Unicode font. 
I assume that it's complete because it includes polytonic Greek, and polytonic (i.e., ancient) Greek is not exactly a big market (~10,000 worldwide at most). 
The font you're talking about is probably the Palatino version of an MS/Monotype Unicode font (I don't remember the exact name, but it is Palatino something Unicode). 
I would speculate that MS might add these Unicode fonts to some future version of the web fonts pack at their typography site ( http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ ), someday. 
Maybe. 
Who knows? 
Just in case, I check every couple of weeks. 
P. T. Rourke There are very few Unicode encoded fonts, and I doubt there are any UTF-8 encoded fonts; documents IE5/NT4 substitutes Symbol for the mathematical symbols and therefore fails to display them all, unless you make Lucida Sans Unicode your standard font for the user defined language and overide the encoding from UTF-8 to user defined (other combinations may work). 
Thai works, I don't know why. 
Arabic work, possibly because I have the arabic fonts. 
Hebrew, Cyrillic and Greek seem to work. 
The remainder fail, even though I have Simplified and Traditional Chinese fonts that work if you select GB2312 or BIG5 encodings for Chinese - forcing simplified chinese gets out your Japanese syllabic stuff. 
Netscape 4.5/NT 4 fails to get the Thai, Hebrew and Arabic and requires the character set to be manually set to UTF8. 
If you manually select Lucida Sans Unicode as the Unicode font, you get the full set of maths symbols, but the default Unicode font is Times New Roman, for which you only get a subset (the same as IE5, I think). 
Selecting a simplified Chinese font as your Unicode font, or configuring the font for simplified chinese and selecting it as the character set, gets the Japaneses syllabics. 
On NT4, therefore, with a current IE and a recent NS, I'd say that Unicode support was still rather broken. 
Incidentally, http://home.att.net/~jameskass/ (Unicode Support in Your Browser) seems a useful resource in this area, including pointers to various more or less complete Unicode fonts, mainly shareware.
