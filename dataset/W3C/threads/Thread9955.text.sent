Issues: + legal uses of rdf:Description + obsoleting rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007 Good news: I now have a (not yet public) version of ARP that passes nearly all the test cases from the April publication. 
This is driven from the Manifest file Bad news: the errors ... The ones it doesn't attempt are: (Manifest is unhelpful, tests themselves are probably OK) nested-bag-IDs/test010a nested-bag-IDs/test011a nested-bag-IDs/test012a nested-bag-IDs/test010b nested-bag-IDs/test011b nested-bag-IDs/test012b Should be obsoleted: rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007 Plain wrong (IMO): rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-013 rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-026 i.e. test-013 legal rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/node1" rdf:Description rdf:resource="http://example.org/node2" / test-026 legal rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/node1" rdf:Description="string" / These are about rdf:Description being used as a property name. 
I see rdf:Description as a syntactic word like rdf:ID or rdf:about, and it is not and never can be the predicate of a triple. 
(Not withstanding my proposal about the RDF Graph!). 
Also I did not find the minute approving these test cases; the link from the Test Cases WD takes us to the action to create them. 
ACTION 2001-11-30#4 Dave Beckett: Create test cases covering reserved use of rdf names in this proposal. 
(Of course I wouldn't raise a procedural question if I hadn't discovered that I disagreed with the outcome!) Other Manifest errors (Apr 29) include: missing test:warning on unrecognised-xml-attributes/test001 unrecognised-xml-attributes/test002 and possibly on some of the rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-0XX ARP is also happy with all the PENDING test cases in the April 29 zip. 
I should get ARP running off the web site today, currently I am testing against the zip; it will fail the charmod-uri tests still since I haven't sorted that yet. 
Jeremy I spoke too soon In truth I had a broken test harness :( Moreover having fixed a bug in the test harness there are now rather more bugs in both ARP and the test cases apparant. 
Some in the test cases include: rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.rdf test004.rdf 
rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-025.rdf xmlbase/test014.rdf 
ARP is still buggy around the xml-literals but some of those test cases have neglected the language tags. 
I attached a zip of modified nt files. 
Jeremy Jeremy Carroll said: Yes, I am in a similar situation stomping bugs in my software and the test cases (Incidently many of the test cases changes have all lines changed, so 'cvs diff' won't work and a visual inspection or hand-editing is required to see the changes.) 
I concur. 
This needed updating for rdf:ID on a property, a very early test and we only quite recently decided on that meaning. 
I also took the opportunity to make the test clearer; used legal the test and removed some of the many foo/bar values to make the answer clearer. 
I attach my new versions of the test004.rdf and test004.nt 
I also concur with this bug; already reported to Jan - rdf:li instead of rdf:_1 in ntriples (but hey, most of the 50+ machine generated tests seem OK!) Yes this is wrong. 
You have a correct fix You also fixed: rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt 
I agree (URL \u escaping) rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test002.nt rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test003.nt 
I don't see any change; the latest versions of these in the CVS contains the xml"" fixes, which I updated in early May for several tests rdfms-nested-bagIDs/test008.nt 
I can't tell what you changed here, even with fixing the line endings, it looks significantly different but more correct given the rdf:ID clarification. 
I think it might benefit from adding an rdf:about to the rdf:Description since that isn't important to this test, and renaming some of the bnodes from _j: n . 
_:j0 would turn into a uri-ref, if the rdf:about was added and _:j3 is the reified statement node. 
The absence of _:j1 and _:j2 is unnecessary I think.

Jeremy Carroll said: I can't check these yet since my code here isn't done. 
I agree (aboutEach) I agree (rdf:Description is syntax) I don't think XML says that they should be warning; just ignored. 
Are we testing things not in our spec again? 
:) I thought I had all those. 
You'll need to be more specific Dave
