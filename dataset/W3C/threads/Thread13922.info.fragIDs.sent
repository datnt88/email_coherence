<s> Does this mean that everyone agrees that they are OK as they stand?  </s>
<s> Please speak up - Yea or Nay.  </s>

<s> Brian, Re technique 1.1.B (LONGDESC use): I checked over the WAI Page Authoring Guidelines and they suggest, in their techniques, using a 'd' link as well as the LONGDESC.  </s>
<s> Current versions of Netscape &amp; IE do not support the LONGDESC so, until they do support it, we should ask the author to put in a 'd' link for complex images.  </s>
<s> The 'd' links are more messy for the page layout then the LONGDESC but it looks like, for now, they will have to remain in use.  </s>
<s> I'll update the ERT document today with this new info.  </s>
<s> Re technique 4.3.A (LANG attribute): I think that we'll have to concentrate on HTML for this version of repair tools and ignore XML.  </s>
<s> If we start dealing with XML now, we'll never finish on the HTML.  </s>

<s> as:  </s>
<s> For longdesc, there is the valid case where the image is complex, there's no longdesc attribute, but the "longdesc" is inline, that is, described in html markup close to the image (e.g. "Figure 1 presents our new organization chart with Greg on top, Daniel at the bottom, etc".)  </s>
<s> A (somewhat costly) repair technique for guessing the primary LANG is the use of dictionaries of common and exclusive words in common languages.  </s>
<s> E.g. is you find "a, the, you, for, is, of, and" then it's engligh, if you find "le, du, la, a, se, pour, aux, des, ne" then it's french, etc.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> If a document contained an image and the purpose of the document was to describe the image then would that document be the LONGDESC file for the image?  </s>
<s> Perhaps the prompt for a LONGDESC should be something like: You need a LONGDESC if the image is complex and it's not described in this document.  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> I'll add your comment to the repair suggestions for the technique.  </s>
<s> I think that this repair technique would only be useful if we were performing an automatic repair without the users input.  </s>
