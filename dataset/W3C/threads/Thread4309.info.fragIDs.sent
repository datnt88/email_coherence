The rules tell me that '#' is not escaped if $escape-reserved is true. 
However, in the first example the result contains %23 instead of #. 
Is there any special reason to use "http://www.example.com/..." for the first example and "http://example.com/..." for the second? 
I recommend to use the same input parameter for both examples.

It seems I should first draft my comments completely before sending them ... anyway: The first part in the path of the example URI looks like a leftover from the previous version. 
(The "spinaltap.micro.umn.edu" part). 
One of or are sufficient examples IMHO. 
Another suggestion: use a space instead of %20 in the input. 
(or use a non-ASCII somewhere as already suggested). 
Then the spec has an example of a string that contains - characters that are never escaped (e.g. letters) - characters that are escaped depending on $escape-reserved - characters that are always escaped (currently there are no such characters in the example) Oliver Becker

Thanks! That's a typo. 
We will fix it.
