<s> Are there any accessibility tools out there that can be integrated into a bespoke CMS app to double check pages as they are created?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> I've worked with a CMS developer to integrate Site Valet functionality into their system (Blue Chip users include two of Mrs Thatcher's privatisations from the 1980s).  </s>
<s> The primary focus was QA, but the Enterprise Edition of Valet of course treats accessibility as one aspect of QA and provides comprehensive testing, reporting and auditing.  </s>

<s> Hi Nick,  </s>
<s> OK, sounds interesting, I'll have to look into it in more detail.  </s>
<s> Our CMS is written in C# and I really want to introduce a facility to check the accessibility of new content before signoff.  </s>
<s> Whilst we can check that the page templates are accessible, we will want to be able to report on the added content blocks (obviously bearing in mind what they will look like in the templates) and then provide a 'plain English' report to the contributor highlighting any problems before the pages are made live.  </s>
<s> Is this the sort of thing that I can use Site Valet for?  </s>
<s> If yes, I see there is a windows dll version - do you have any samples or know of any developers that have used it with C#?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> There is WAINU, an open source tool in Java that does testing - it has  </s>
<s> an LGPL license that allows it to be used in conjunction with proprietary software, although any modifications made to it must be released back as source code.  </s>
<s> I know that AccVerify has an API allowing it to be integrated into systems, and I am pretty sure that there is one in LIFT as well.  </s>
<s> Presumably other comparable products have the same thing.  </s>
<s> (I'd be interested in seeing the results you find).  </s>

<s> If it is being used to develop software for in house use (or as an agent of someone else, with no rights being retained), you don't need to release the source code.  </s>
<s> [L]GPL type licences make source code availability a condition of distribution, not of use.  </s>
<s> (In the agent case, the commissioner gets to own any IPR added to the source code.) (You don't actually have to provide source code up front when you distribute externally, but the penalty is that anyone downstream of you can then request it at no more than the handling cost, whereas, if you provide it up front you only need to supply to the people that you directly supply with the binary.)  </s>
<s> The rules on mixing with commercial software with full GPL code only apply to distribution, as well.  </s>
<s> In house, you can mix with impunity.  </s>
<s> IANAL.  </s>

<s> Thanks, I'll see if I can find some more info on this, although being Java based am not sure about the integration side of things.  </s>
