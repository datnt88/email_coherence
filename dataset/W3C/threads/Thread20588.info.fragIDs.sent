I installed the Amaya GTK 6.4 Linux rpm yesterday. 
My dialogue language is german. 
Entries from de-amayadialogue and de-amayamsg in the config directory are not displayed in menus and dialogues if they contain umlauts (???) or 
possibly other non ascii characters. 
Has this something to do with fonts/X11 or glibc locale? 
Umlauts are displayed when they appear in a HTML page in all views (structure, source, text).

Hi Karl, 
I'm not able to read german dialogues but they seem well displayed in my GTK 6.4 version. 
Could you point me to an dialogue entry that doesn't work? 
It could be due to your glibc locale? 
I suspect more a choice of a specific font for your GTK dialogues. 
Could you check your configuration file .gtkrc 
Irene. 
e.g. the following entries in de-amayadialogue 25 ?ffnen 
26 ?ffnen 
(neues Fenster)... 33 DTD ?ndern and all others that contain umlauts. 
Interestingly, the tool tips are displayed correctly, even those containing umlauts, like 86 Zur?ck 87 Vorw?rts 97 ?berschrift 
Ebene 1 in de-amayamsg, but for instance "2 Zur?cksetzen" in de-amayamsg is not displayed in dialogues. 
However, when I replace umlauts by ascii characters, like e.g. "2 Zuruecksetzen", Amaya displays the string correctly. 
I don't have a .gtkrc in my home directory. 
There are a lot of files /etc/gtk/gtkrc. 
language , but no /etc/gtk/gtkrc.de 
or /etc/gtk/gtkrc.en.

I suspect you will have the same problem with French dialogs. 
Did you update some GTK or X libraries ? 
You have to look in that direction.
