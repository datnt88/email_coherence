<s> I installed the Amaya GTK 6.4 Linux rpm yesterday.  </s>
<s> My dialogue language is german.  </s>
<s> Entries from de-amayadialogue and de-amayamsg in the config directory are not displayed in menus and dialogues if they contain umlauts (???) or  </s>
<s> possibly other non ascii characters.  </s>
<s> Has this something to do with fonts/X11 or glibc locale?  </s>
<s> Umlauts are displayed when they appear in a HTML page in all views (structure, source, text).  </s>

<s> Hi Karl,  </s>
<s> I'm not able to read german dialogues but they seem well displayed in my GTK 6.4 version.  </s>
<s> Could you point me to an dialogue entry that doesn't work?  </s>
<s> It could be due to your glibc locale?  </s>
<s> I suspect more a choice of a specific font for your GTK dialogues.  </s>
<s> Could you check your configuration file .gtkrc  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> e.g. the following entries in de-amayadialogue 25 ?ffnen  </s>
<s> 26 ?ffnen  </s>
<s> (neues Fenster)... 33 DTD ?ndern and all others that contain umlauts.  </s>
<s> Interestingly, the tool tips are displayed correctly, even those containing umlauts, like 86 Zur?ck 87 Vorw?rts 97 ?berschrift  </s>
<s> Ebene 1 in de-amayamsg, but for instance "2 Zur?cksetzen" in de-amayamsg is not displayed in dialogues.  </s>
<s> However, when I replace umlauts by ascii characters, like e.g. "2 Zuruecksetzen", Amaya displays the string correctly.  </s>
<s> I don't have a .gtkrc in my home directory.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of files /etc/gtk/gtkrc.  </s>
<s> language , but no /etc/gtk/gtkrc.de  </s>
<s> or /etc/gtk/gtkrc.en.  </s>
<s> Karl-Michael  </s>
<s> I suspect you will have the same problem with French dialogs.  </s>
<s> Did you update some GTK or X libraries ?  </s>
<s> You have to look in that direction.  </s>
