<s> Hi, Our source tar file amaya-src-2.4.tgz includes all the Amaya and libwww stuff.  </s>
<s> When the source tar file is unpacked it should create an Amaya directory and a liwww directory.  </s>
<s> I don't know why the unpack failed when it tried to create the libwww directory.  </s>

<s> I thought configure had found an install program already.  </s>
<s> * The only problems with the build were: When the source tar file was unpacked it created an Amaya directory and put the stuff in it, but it tried to put things into a libwww directory which was in the same directory as the Amaya directory -- i.e Amaya/.. and it failed because there was no such directory.  </s>
<s> Most software distributed as tar files creates one directory and puts everything below that.  </s>
<s> When I moved everything down one level putting the tar file in a new Amaya directory, creating an empty libwww directory in there with it, then the untarring went OK. I didn't epect gmake to complain about the lack of an Options file, or a .depends  </s>

<s> The messages have been lost im my command tool, but basically it said there was no such directory as libwww when it tried to put files in it.  </s>

<s> Amaya and libwww are two distributions in the same tar file.  </s>
<s> They have exactly the same access rights, the same user id and the same group id.  </s>
<s> I'm quite sure your problem was due to an accidental error during the unpack.  </s>
<s> This file is located in the directory Amaya.  </s>
<s> It seems you had a great trouble during the unpack.  </s>
<s> Could you check that you have a valid amaya-src-2.4.tgz file.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you omitted to set the binary mode when you downloaded the tar file by ftp?  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> I used http.  </s>
<s> Can you provide us with an MD5 string on please?  </s>
<s> Then I can confirm that things are as they should be.  </s>
