Hi, Our source tar file amaya-src-2.4.tgz includes all the Amaya and libwww stuff. 
When the source tar file is unpacked it should create an Amaya directory and a liwww directory. 
I don't know why the unpack failed when it tried to create the libwww directory.

The build for amaya 2.4 seemed to go fairly* OK. On installing: gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/libjpeg' gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'. 
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/libjpeg' ../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127 gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/amaya' brains# pwd /home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1 
I thought configure had found an install program already. 
* The only problems with the build were: When the source tar file was unpacked it created an Amaya directory and put the stuff in it, but it tried to put things into a libwww directory which was in the same directory as the Amaya directory -- i.e Amaya/.. and it failed because there was no such directory. 
Most software distributed as tar files creates one directory and puts everything below that. 
When I moved everything down one level putting the tar file in a new Amaya directory, creating an empty libwww directory in there with it, then the untarring went OK. I didn't epect gmake to complain about the lack of an Options file, or a .depends 
file, but it created these so persumably they are OK. Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk

May I suggest that it create them both in a single parent 
directory? 
That way "gtar -ztvf amaya-src-2.4.tgz | head" will 
be enough to tell you where everything ends up. 
Because it didn't try to create it. 
The messages have been lost im my command tool, but basically it said there was no such directory as libwww when it tried to put files in it. 
So what about this ../install.sh not being found?

Amaya and libwww are two distributions in the same tar file. 
They have exactly the same access rights, the same user id and the same group id. 
I'm quite sure your problem was due to an accidental error during the unpack. 
This file is located in the directory Amaya. 
It seems you had a great trouble during the unpack. 
Could you check that you have a valid amaya-src-2.4.tgz file. 
Perhaps you omitted to set the binary mode when you downloaded the tar file by ftp? 
Irene. 
I used http. 
Can you provide us with an MD5 string on please? 
Then I can confirm that things are as they should be. 
Meanwhile, it looks like gnu tar 1.13 is out, so I will upgrade ny 1.12. 
Thank you.
