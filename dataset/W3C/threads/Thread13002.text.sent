Ok North Americans, how come everyone's picking on the White House this week? 
On a serious note, doesn't S-508 apply to the top site? 
Seems to make a bit of a farce of the legislation. 
Andrew WebReference FEATURE: Whitehouse.gov Usability: The Web Wing Along with a new administration we get a new and hopefully improved Web site for the nation's first house, Whitehouse.gov. 
President Bush's staff has eliminated much of the previous administration's content and reworked the design. 
The new site, although faster loading, still has some usability issues. 
Hopefully by exploring the usability and design problems of this prominent public site, we can show you what to watch out for in your next redesign. 
The new design is definitely an improvement over the old one (remember those big oval buttons?). 
It has some good content, short blurbs for new stories, and a tighter layout. 
The page nearly fits into one screen, a big improvement over the old one. 
For navigation the page uses more text than graphics. 
This makes it more accessible. 
However, some common usability problems remain. 
1. 
Fixed FONT sizes are used rather than relative 2. Fixed table widths (horizontal scrolling) 3. Too many graphics (slow load), non-working rollovers (Mac) 4. Overdone ALT text (Don't Make Me Think!) 5. Glaring HTML errors ( /HTML starts the source) 6. 
A hard-to-read cursive font 7. Inconsistent navigation Using one big and complex fixed-width TABLE makes for a slow initial load (25 seconds to see anything at 31Kbps). 
Unoptimized HTML and perhaps worst of all numerous blocks of unused commented HTML bloat the home page unnecessarily. 
A quick check with Websitegarage.com shows poor load time, and fair browser compatibility and HTML design. 
72 HTML objects to grab and a total of nearly 90K for the home page make for a slow load over today's average connection speed, 56Kbps. 
I want to see where President Bush is now, not wait around for his page to load. 
Some possible solutions would be to: 1. Use relative font sizes (let the user decide how to size fonts) 1a. 
Use CSS to control font sizes - linked stylesheet sitewide would make for easier maintenance 2. Use relative TABLE widths (fluid tables fit in more screens) 3. Consolidate nav bar graphics into one client/server side ISMAP 4. Tighten up ALT text (easier to understand with graphics off/Lynx) 5. Validate your HTML 6. Use a more legible font for graphic text, or use straight text and CSS hover, or table/DIV rollovers 7. Clean up navigation, have a usability audit (home page link on home page?) 8. Even better, use CSS to layout the page for newer browsers Shouldn't this page set an example for other pages, especially .govs? 
What about section 508 of the ADA? 
Don't just take my word for it, other usability experts agree. 
LA Times/Useit.com/Ben Henick Weblog, Sep. 3, 2001 i appreciate andrews's comments and have one coment that is open for discussion on table width. 
andrew advises to use relative over fixed. 
while i agree with his anlaysis, i disagree using relative. 
froma retail and content environemnt, i set table width to 600. 
this ensures that it can be printed on every printer. 
if the graphics and other content push the width to over 600, then it does not print well. 
the customer will have a poor customer experience. 
i have seen this width many retailers that use table width set to 645 or over 700. 
i have had problems printing pages with relative tables. 
i would be inclined to suggest there may be a techinique here to state how best to use relative tables. 
does anyone have any thoughts here?

Hello Rob, Not my critique - 'twas from webreference.com [http://www.webreference.com/new/010910.html#feature] 
I sent it along as it was the second critique I had received via various lists in the same week. 
Cheers, Andrew
