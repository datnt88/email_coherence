Hi Dave ! 
How can I tell Tidy (vers 27th September 1999 for win(lose?)95) 
NOT to insert line breaks, even for VERY LONG lines ? 
"-wrap 0" doesn't seem to give the desired result 8^) actually, I use "-wrap 1024" instead, which is adequate for 95% of my files. 
But what about the resting 5 % ? 
Is there a max value ? 
(maybe it's allright just to mention it in the manual, not necessarily to modify the program) best regards Norbert / \ This was TMTM (The Megabyte Text Magician) / norbert@globenet.org

You can set the number to the maximum value for a signed 32 bit integer. 
However, I agree that it would be nicer to avoid the need to know what this number is. 
"wrap: 0" seems like a reasonable way as does "wrap: never". 
I will look into this for the next release.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) Whilst I agree that this would a useful feature, I think that the wrap issue on attribute values needs to be addressed separately (see earlier posting in the wrap of the TITLE= value but not the CONTENT= value). 
I think that there is a need to disable the wrap of attribute values whilst still allowing the indent and wrap of body text. 
My justification is that wrapped and indented TITLE= values (and perhaps some others) is often visible to the browser user.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) (This has nothing to do with the wrap option...) Hi Dave, Perhaps you'll hear from me more often. 
I'm just about to tidy up a  1000 pages Website, some of which with a quite complex structure, which might push TIDY to its limits. 
Maybe even beyond them... :-)) (FYI, I use a Cyrix 586 133 MHz machine built out of spare parts, with 64M RAM, under Win95.A release and Debian 2.0 GNU/Linux 2.0.34 (but no RPM converter, and not yet time to compile the sources...) It was the third page I was working on when happened the following : calling TIDY to cleanup the page "frag.html" 
(I'll keep a copy for you on the site at URL http://www.globenet.org/periph/agenda/frag-old.html , so you may try out yourself. 
If the page doesn't exist, this means that today's update is still to come, and the old file is still named "frag.html"). 
I use a "html.bat" 
file with just one line : tidy.exe -config html.ini -wrap 1024 %1  html.htm 
You notice that I redirect the screen output in order to create the cleaned-up file, as (unlike the manual says) TIDY doesn't write to the disk, at least when I use it in a DOS-window inside Win95. 
I didn't yet try it otherwise. 
and the "html.ini" 
file looks like this : indent: auto doctype: strict char-encoding: ascii break-before-br: yes uppercase-tags: yes uppercase-attributes: yes clean: yes logical-emphasis: yes keep-time: yes error-file: error.txt 
So, I started with : waited one or 2 seconds, as usual, but then... (thought, maybe it takes somewhat longer, as this page is the biggest I tidied up, 'til now) after some minutes, I CTRL-BREAK the program. 
Then, I found a zero-length "html.htm" 
file and an "error.txt" 
file which at first sight had 365k in size, but NO ! 
It were 365MEGAS ! 
In fact, if I'd waited a bit more, maybe the program had eaten up all my disk space... Next time, I'll let it write the output to a diskette :-) CU soon Norbert P.S. The error file starts like this : Tidy (vers 27th September 1999) Parsing "frag~1.htm"

I have isolated the problem down to the markup: I plan to have a new release fixing this within the next few days.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) Thanks for the file - I have fixed the bug, so that Tidy no longer crashes. 
It has detected that several of the img elements are missing the closing ' ' characters. 
I will post the revised version of Tidy soon, probably tomorrow (Friday 22nd).
