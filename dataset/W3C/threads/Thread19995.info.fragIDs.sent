<s> I have just been spell checking two documents with Amaya, and there are a few things I hope can be fixed in future releases.  </s>
<s> First, there is no "skip without adding to dictionary" item, which would  </s>
<s> be desirable (having an "oops, go back" button would also be useful).  </s>
<s> Second, the dictionary is very sparse.  </s>
<s> It lacks W3C, URI, P3P, Amaya.... a number of terms.  </s>
<s> Maybe the W3C should generate a list of its own abbreviations and technologies and put that into the dictionary?  </s>
<s> Third, when it is done with the document, it gives an error message saying "can't find that word", instead of "end of document" or something similar.  </s>
<s> This is very confusing.  </s>
<s> Johan  </s>
<s> The first button "Search/Skip" does that.  </s>
<s> You can undo (Ctrl Z) the replace, but the Undo doesn't remove an entry added into the dictionary.  </s>
<s> That's a good idea.  </s>
<s> I'll do that.  </s>
<s> I understand your trouble, but the end of the search could be the top of the document (Before selection) the end of an element (witihn selection).  </s>
<s> I'll see how to imporve that interface.  </s>
<s> Thank for the report Irene.  </s>
<s> How about "spellcheck completed"?  </s>
