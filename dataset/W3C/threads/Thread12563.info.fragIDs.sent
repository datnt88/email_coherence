<s> You might even say something like: "Until user agents can automatically speak the text equivalent of the visual track of a multimedia presentation, provide an auditory description of its important information." but that's up to the *real* wordsmiths G !  </s>
<s> CPL:: I put in the comma, but I won't/can't rewrite actual wording lifted from the WCAG Rec.  </s>
<s> Slide 20: "...synchronize equivalent alternatives..." I wonder if there's some way to expand this into a "how to".  </s>
<s> CPL:: I have asked our resident multimedia expert, Geoff Freed to expand on this.  </s>

<s> I remember the example as "working" which this one doesn't.  </s>
<s> The explanation left me more confused than instructed but I don't exactly know what to do since I don't know if there's just a coding error, a browser problem, or Thursday brain fog.  </s>

<s> CPL:: sorry... wrong forum for this comment... take it up with the chair of the WCAG.  </s>
<s> grin  </s>
<s> Slide 26: The "don't be frightened" struck me as not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the set since you spoke of feeling constrained not to get into such jocularity.  </s>

<s> I will go straight through the checkpoints without jumping to the examples although I did notice that when I went to the examples and tried to jump back my natural instinct to click on the arrow didn't work; had to click on the "To checkpoints..."  </s>
<s> CPL:: will ponder this, but inter-set navigation is a bit problematic.  </s>
<s> Also I'm not sure the link in 1.1 (which duplicates the link in 1.1a) makes sense.  </s>
<s> CPL:: Fixed  </s>
<s> I wonder if 1.1b's "including symbols" might have a disclaimer to cover MathML?  </s>
<s> CPL:: I agree.  </s>
<s> It is done.  </s>
<s> I don't understand 2.2 having both P2 &amp; P3? Also I hope we've made certain that the use of color in the instant example (the Priority blocks) qualifies under this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Once again it's not *just* the contrast that causes problems.  </s>
<s> CPL:: I reread the explanation for the lower priority on color controlled  </s>
<s> by style or markup (priority 3 for text) and it makes sense to me.  </s>
<s> If the  </s>
<s> user can control the color, then it is not a significant problem.  </s>
<s> Since  </s>
<s> you can't control the color as easily in an image, then the responsibility falls to the graphic designer to choose good color contrast.  </s>
<s> CPL:: I arbitrarily chose three colors to quickly distinguish the priority ratings visually... not to convey a message with those color choices.  </s>
<s> You have not come right out and said my choices were bad, but you were hinting (Yes...  </s>
<s> I caught the hint grin ).  </s>
<s> I would be happy for someone with a better color-sense than I to choose some appropriate foreground/background combinations that are in the 216 color Netscape safe set.  </s>
<s> I cannot accept 3.1 as Priority 2 since the use of PageMaker or PDF as "pictures of text" is completely contrary to the idea of a blind person being able to use it.  </s>
<s> I don't understand the " " in front of 3.4 or the grammar of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> OH! it's a coding error, there's a link there that doesn't show up right.  </s>
<s> CPL:: I don't recall the GL discussions on this point in any detail, but the decision must be documented somewhere in the archives or minutes.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we will have to revisit this item in version 2 of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> CPL:: coding errors fixed.  </s>
<s> I gather Cps for GL 5 &amp; 6 didn't "make the cut" yet.  </s>
<s> CPL:: there were an incredible number of bugs in the Checkpoint slide set... all have been identified and corrected.  </s>
<s> 7.1 "...avoid causing the screen to flicker." might be "...allow no part or all of the screen to flicker."  </s>
<s> CPL:: you may be right, but I ain't changin the Recommendation's wording (at this stage, anyway).  </s>
<s> 10.3 has a suspicious leading " " which probably indicates a coding error.  </s>
<s> Font size change from CP 10 to CP 11.  </s>
<s> I've never used frames so I don't know what controls associated with labels means.  </s>
<s> CPL:: Are you are referring to Checkpoint 12.4?  </s>
<s> It doesn't have anything to do with FRAMES.  </s>
<s> It does have to do with FORMS.  </s>
<s> Ok... in this case I broke my own rule about tampering with Rec-text and I added "(in a FORM)" to the checkpoint to make it clearer when taken out of context.  </s>
<s> Feel free to suggest this to the GL group as an editorial change for the Rec.  </s>
<s> I don't like 14.2.  </s>

<s> Slide 39: There's an "orphan" period at the beginning of the second line of the second paragraph.  </s>
<s> CPL:: did I fix it?  </s>
<s> I think I fixed it.  </s>
<s> Does "orphan" mean I had one too many or one too few.  </s>
<s> Regardless, when I looked at the slide (in IE) it seemed to be all right.  </s>
<s> Confusing?  </s>
<s> You bet.  </s>
<s> Slide 41: "Note that the reverse is often true when TABLE is just used for page design and lay out."  </s>
<s> I don't know what this means - reverse of what?? In general I'm not sure why it has "A simple data table created with proper table mark up, like this:" and then "Example of a simple data table created using HTML markup." or why the "Example of a simple data table created using the PRE element." is in blue and a different font?  </s>
<s> also no code example illustrating the PRE use.  </s>
<s> And I think this is the first slide on which I had to use horizontal scrolling which is a PITA.  </s>
<s> CPL:: I see your point...  </s>
<s> I changed the wording to: "Note: if you are using tables for page layout (instead of CSS), then you should not use markup reserved for data tables (like TH, HEADER, SCOPE, COLGROUP, etc.) because those elements will be used by some agents to identify and manipulate data).  </s>
<s> " The scrolling seems only to be necessary in NETSCAPE and I can't figure out why.  </s>
<s> Yet.  </s>
<s> Slide 43, 44, 45: Old people would like a comma after "headers" in the intro.  </s>
<s> I don't understand what [priority 2] at the end of the discussion means.  </s>
<s> I don't understand why the font changes size after "worksheet." in the discussion part.  </s>
<s> "try and remember" try to remember.  </s>
<s> Also I gather from other discussions I've had that "today's crop of screen readers" may be less prone to what you're talking about here.  </s>
<s> CPL:: comma replaced in slide 43.  </s>
<s> Priority 2 was an artifact of a previous slide, now removed.  </s>
<s> Fixed font-size change.  </s>
<s> Fixed wording about current crop, but didn't remove it entirely.  </s>
<s> Not completely sure how to deal with this issue, because while some of the newer screen-readers (and some non-graphical browsers) can decolumnize simple tables, it will take HTML 4.0 aware agents that understand colgroup, scope, thead, tfoot, etc. to demystify complex tables.  </s>
<s> I am not sure where to put this idea, but it needs to be said somewhere.  </s>
<s> Slide 46: The font size went crazy for this slide - also scrolling required once again.  </s>
<s> CPL:: Will try to fix it.  </s>
<s> Slide 47: "As more and more browsers" become "more browsers" we tersify.  </s>
<s> CPL:: tersified!  </s>

<s> I forget whether px is absolute, but anyway check to see if you've used relative units of measure - you naughty boy!  </s>
<s> CPL:: sigh... Netscape is very touchy about style sheet commands (or IE is very tolerant... not sure which).  </s>
<s> I think Jim found a partial (non WCAG  </s>

<s> Slide 54: I'm not sure what "animated image" means here.  </s>
<s> CPL:: "animated image" refers to the animated image.  </s>
<s> At least it is animated when I look at it.  </s>
<s> The picture in the example flips back and forth between a house and a telephone.  </s>
<s> Slide 56: If this is supposed to work...  </s>
<s> I get to the same thing whenever I hit the link.  </s>
<s> The device-independent event-handlers in this example work in IE4, but not, apparently in Netscape 4. My HTML 4 book seems to indicate they should work in Netscape 4, but for some reason, they don't.  </s>

<s> Do it for them, please.  </s>

<s> Call in the grammarians!  </s>
<s> I guess I don't have javascript enabled so will have to take your word that something like you say should happen would happen.  </s>
<s> I'll try it another time since I have to almost re-boot to enable javascript and don't really know if I can.  </s>
<s> Also I think you should check your style sheets to see if code examples can't be made all the same font.  </s>
<s> CPL:: is "the link itself will be followed and a new HTML page will load" better?  </s>
<s> Again, there is something quirky about Netscape and style.  </s>
<s> All code examples look the same in IE.  </s>
<s> I will try and find a solution.  </s>
<s> Slide 70: Again it doesn't behave as I was led to expect by the text.  </s>

<s> Added a caveat to the example.  </s>
<s> Slide 72: "The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /wai/three/sam72-0.htm." makes one hate error messages.  </s>
<s> That one from hitting "enter" and "skip" gets a 404.  </s>
<s> CPL:: it doesn't cause a problem on my system (with either Netscape or IE).  </s>
<s> I have temporarily added a warning to NOT submit the example forms since they may cause a problem on some systems.  </s>
<s> I will see if I can identify the problem you had.  </s>
<s> Slide 73: alt+ nothing works only the undo button works, etc.  </s>
