I downloaded the new (this date) zip and unzipped it producing the following tree: C:\ thot\ amaya\ config\ win95\ bin\ amaya.exe 
I double clicked on the executable which did nothing. 
I got sounds of a file opening and a file closing on my speaker. 
I have a pentium p5 PC with 
16M ram running Windows 95. Help? 
I found it necessary to set THOTDIR and HOME environment variables in my AUTOEXEC.BAT and then reboot before Amaya would start. 
Even then, starting it 
appears at first to have no effect - then a minute or so later it mysteriously 
appears as if from nowhere! 
Some sort of "welcome screen" would help a lot.

I assume you mean create an autoexec.bat 
and set thotdir=c:\thot but what do I set home = to? 
I have no problem with this, however, I don't think this is a user responsibility. 
I haven't had an autoexec file on this system since the good old days of MS-DOS and Win3. 
Hopefully, W3 will set the assignments in amaya.exe where they belong . 
. . 
since on most Win95 setups, all the windows stuff is on C:\ and that is where it was suggested that the amaya package be unpacked. 
Thanks. Lee 
starting it 
mysteriously 
lot. 
Okay. 
All files present. 
From the run option in the start bar while online, I typed C:\thot\win95\bin\amaya.exe http://www.basec.net 
This time I got a little more. 
A file opened, the disk rattled a couple of times, a file closed. 
Help?
