Thought this might be of interest re datatypes discussion. 
It's pretty critical, but makes some specific technical claims and offers a counter proposal. 
Since we're supposed to be hooking RDF up to XML Schema datatypes, it's probably worth taking a look at feedback (including negative feedback) from implementors who have been working with it. 
On which front, it might also be worth noting the 'XML Schema 1.1 - you can help!' notice at Dan Not My Type: Sizing Up W3C XML Schema Primitives By Amelia Lewis Continuing our occasional series of opinion pieces from members of the XML community, Amy Lewis takes a hard look at W3C XML Schema datatypes. 
Since the application of XML to data representation first gained public visibility, there has been a movement to enhance its type system beyond that originally provided by DTD. 
Several attempts were made (SOX, XML Data and XML Data Reduced, Datatypes for DTDs, and others) before the W3C handed the problem to the XML Schema Working Group. 
a brief excerpt: There are two fundamental problems with WXS datatyping. 
The first is its design: it's not a type system -- there is no system -- and not even a type collection. 
Rather, it's a collection of collections of types with no coherent or consistent set of interrelations. 
The second problem is a single sentence in the specification: "Primitive datatypes can only be added by revisions to this specification". 
This sentence exists because of the design problem; lacking a concept for what a primitive data type is, the only way to define new types is by appeal to authority. 
The data type library is wholly inextensible, internally inconsistent, bloated in and incomplete for most application domains. 
The bit which particularly struck a chord with me was this: In XML, everything is a string. 
Since XML contains text, everything is, by definition, expressible as a string. 
If we take this as fundamental, then every type in XML is simply a string with certain patterning constraints. 
This is a position which may be defensible in the world of XML, which is very much concerned with a text-based syntax. 
But I think that RDF needs to be able to break free from the constraints of textually based data definitions. 
My own particular pet peeve with XML schema datatypes is the lack of a rational number primitive (my comment was submitted to, considered and rejected by XML schema WG). 
To my view, this should be the concept from which all other numeric data types are derived, by restriction. 
(All schemes for representing numbers in a computer that I'm aware of represent rational numbers only.) I've no objection that RDF should be able to use XML schema datatypes, but I already know of applications where they aren't enough. 
CONNEG uses rational numbers, and we're working to make CONNEG vocabulary accessible to CC/PP. 
#g Graham Klyne Sorry about that; I agree, but I didn't have the energy to fight harder. 
I did put the HTTP-NG type system on the table, which had a nice design for rationals (hm... reviewing, it seems to be fixed-point, not rationals... anyway...). 
Sigh. 
Well, floating point numbers are not restrictions of rationals. 
Floating point multiplication and addition are not, strictly speaking, associative. 
There's a great piece on that in the proceedings of the WG... (searching, I find one of my contributions... Aha! there it is: Floating-point datatypes are not real datatypes Mark Reinhold mr@eng.sun.com 5 October 1999 Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you in Montreal in August at Extreme Markup 2002? 
Well, I share similar blame ... I had an opportunity to register dissent but failed to do so. 
Good point. 
I was only considering representation and comparison. 
I still think that rationals would be a good basis for integers and fixed and some other numeric values... ... but I agree there's a compelling case to treat float and double separately. 
(An alternative might have been to have only integers, and compose rationals, -- this is roughly what XML schema WG said to me -- but it's not clear to me how one would have a standard definition of comparison -- which question the WG did not answer.) Anyway, I guess that's all water under the bridge, and we have to get on with life?
