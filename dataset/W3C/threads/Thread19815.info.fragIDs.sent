<s> Subject: Re: How to download Amaya  </s>
<s> Amaya 1.2a beta public release is now available in *source code* and *precompiled binary* forms.  </s>
<s> Well, I didn't associated "precompiled binary" with "download this browser".  </s>
<s> Ah! Now I understand.  </s>
<s> We live in different worlds.  </s>

<s> Amaya people: timrivera@geocities.com makes a good point.  </s>
<s> People like me (and, obviously, people like your webmaster) provide one audience; you may want to provide text that is meaningful to a second audience as well.  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> [snip] Not that I *mean* to be rude, but...  </s>
<s> One would rather expect that the Amaya developers are quite busy enough, don't you agree?  </s>
<s> And given that Amaya is clearly "advertised" to be an experimental project with which to "play around" and develop new Web technologies and techniques, don't you think that maybe it's not too awful much to expect that folks who download it are at least marginally aware of the terms used in computer technology?  </s>
<s> This is not meant to be a slam against either you or the person to whom you responded, but more a reminder of what Amaya is purported to be.  </s>
<s> At least the last time I looked.  </s>
<s> Amaya is not strictly a browser, btw.  </s>
<s> It's an more an editor that happens to be able to function in a browser-like capacity.  </s>
