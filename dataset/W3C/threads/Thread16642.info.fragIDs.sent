For the last few days I haven't been able to run WAVE 2.01 at and the contact address for Len Kasday, kasday@acm.org, is a reflector to kasday@astro.temple.edu which expands to kasday@concentric.net and returns "User unknown". 
Does anyone know why I get the following error? 
Forbidden You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/wave/wave.pl on this server. 
Apache/1.3.19 Server at pa-at-loan.org Port 80 Is this tool (yes I know it is only a prototype) permanently offline?

Len unexpectedly and quite sadly passed away recently. 
: Temple, the place he worked, are planning to continue offering the WAVE service but they apparently have had some technical difficulties lately.

TAKE CONTROL. 
Larry, The temporary technical problem with WAVE was reported to Temple University earlier this week. 
They have confirmed their commitment to host WAVE, and are working to fix the current problem. 
Your patience is appreciated.
