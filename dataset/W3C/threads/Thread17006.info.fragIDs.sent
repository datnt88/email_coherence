<s> My impression of the BBC's web sites is that your problem is that they don't behave like a single corporation.  </s>
<s> I believe the centre does have an accessibility policy, but the further you get away from the centre, the more you get to standard commercial web site values, e.g. material sourced from the regions generally has very little central influence.  </s>
<s> Even the London national part of the organisation devolves web site design a great deal.  </s>
<s> E.g. material sourced from the regions may not have a low graphics version, whereas material sourced from London is likely to have one, but it will vary from department to department as to whether it actually works.  </s>
<s> (You get a similar thing with UK government sites; although the centre is pushing accessibility, a lot of government departments out-source their web sites to commercial organisations that use commercial design values.) Note that I think it is a good thing that there is devolvment in the BBC.  </s>
<s> I don't think out-sourcing of government sites is good though.  </s>
<s> Government sites are one of the few cases where accessibility and "business" objectives tend to align, but by out-sourcing they get a design based on normal business, where management don't see them as aligning.  </s>
<s> (In the immediate context, it means that, even if you can work out how to contact the webmaster for a government site, you will reach someone who has no accessiblity brief.)  </s>
