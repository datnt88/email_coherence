In section 4.6.1, Overview (of Processing Instructions), the sentence "Namespace nodes must satisfy the following constraints." 
should be "Processing instruction nodes must satisfy the following constraints." 
It would really help us processing your comments if you could identify which of the documents you are commenting on. 
Many reviewers are actually including the document and section reference in the Subject field of their email. 
I assume this comment is on the Data Model Section 4.6.1: 
If I can suggest, a Subject field of "[DM] Section 4.6.1 copy/paste error" would have been better. 
/paulc Paul Cotton, Microsoft Canada 17 Eleanor Drive, Nepean, Ontario K2E 6A3 Michael, et al, Because there are a pretty large number of documents currently out for review in the XQuery/XSLT/XPath space, it would be very helpful is each comment at least stated the specific document to which the comment applies. 
In this case, of course, we can make an educated guess that is confirmed by examining the document we have guessed to be the intended one. 
In other cases, it might require that we search several documents. 
On the other hand, I really appreciate your identification of the relevant section both by number and by title --- that makes it far easier to be sure that we locate the section where you found the problem or have a question and helps protect against a typographical error in (for example) just the number --- e.g., if you had accidentally typed "section 6.4.1" when you meant to type "4.6.1".
