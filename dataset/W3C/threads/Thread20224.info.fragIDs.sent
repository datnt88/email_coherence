<s> Some general questions: - Any chance of a GPL version of Amaya?  </s>

<s> Thanks, Aaron  </s>
<s> Amaya is meant to follow the guidelines, as fast as it can be implemented (along with a number of other things that are being impleemented by a small and hard-working team).  </s>
<s> In the CVS version there are shortcuts for just about everything in the linux version.  </s>
<s> I would like to do windows shortcuts too, but I don't have a windows machine currently to find out what makes sense for them.  </s>
<s> The W3C license, which is what covers Amaya, is more like a BSD license than a GPL.  </s>
<s> But I suspect building a developer community is more a question of people knowing about it and wanting to hack on a browser/editor that does lots of interesting things, and about providing the necessary support for people to work on the code.  </s>
<s> (Note that I am not part of the Amaya development team, just an intersted user, so my comments probably don't mean much ;-) cheers Charles  </s>

<s> As Charles explained the W3C license is more than a GPL.  </s>
<s> Amaya implements W3C recommendations and has some trouble with invalid documents.  </s>
<s> It's quite easy to add or change keyboard shortcuts.  </s>
<s> Could you give a list of keyboard shortcuts which are missing for you.  </s>
<s> We could add them in the next release.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
