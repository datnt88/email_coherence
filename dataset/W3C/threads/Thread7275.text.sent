The next technical meeting on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning is currently scheduled for November 14-15 at Xerox PARC, in the SF Bay area. 
Larry Masinter has graciously offered to host this meeting -- thank you! 
Unlike the past meetings, this one is planned for two days to allow sufficient time for discussion of draft specifications for achieving distributed authoring and versioning capability. 
Please let me know soon if these dates will not work for you. 
So far these dates seem good for most people, based on email contact with people, and an informal show of hands at the Cambridge meeting. 
More details on registration, etc. will soon be forthcoming. 
- Jim I'll admit, I am extremely envious, and sorry I am the only european in the group. 
Unfortunately, I cannot afford to take part to any meeting in the States unless I find some funding on the way, which, at the state, seems at best unlikely (Microsoft?). 
I was wondering if there could be a willingness to organize one of our meetings at the University of Bologna, Italy. 
Bologna is the oldest universities of the western civilization, having been founded in 1088 (one, zero, eight, eight) for lax and medicine studies. 
Besides being famous for art and cuisine, Bologna is also 1/2 from Florence, Venice and Ravenna, and has a good air connections with most European airports (Rome, Paris, Brussels, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, etc.). 
I could organize something around December or January. 
Fabio Not the _only_ European.

Fabio, At present, the majority of active participants on this list are located in the United States, with slightly more on the West Coast than on the East Coast. 
This has been the driving factor in keeping the meetings in the US. 
I'm game for holding a meeting in Europe, especially since I've never been to Italy, but I suspect that many of the people who have been coming to these meetings would be unable to make it. 
My fear is we would end up losing several months, or end up with a result which did not reflect a consensus view, if we were to hold a meeting in Europe at which there was poor attendance. 
On the other hand, I do realize that the web was invented in Europe, and there are many people there who are knowledgable about the WWW, and versioning issues. 
It certainly would be nice if their knowledge could be easily applied to this effort.
