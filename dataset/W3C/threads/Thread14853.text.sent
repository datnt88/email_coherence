Here is the list of big issues we collected at the meeting. 
I will reword them better later. 
but I wanted to report them exactly here. 
This was just what people said as we went round the table. 
If you have additional BIG ISSUES to add, please send them to the list with BIG ISSUE in the Subject line. 
1. Baseline browser capabilities - in general - in specific contexts (intranet, public kiosk) 2. User literacy level 3. Differences by language 4. What is an equivalent? 5. How document is interpreted by non-technical people 6. Implementation 7. Normative vs. informative (do we need normative?) 8. One version for all vs. multiple versions of web content - client-side vs. server-side - reading levels 9. Access for absolutely all? 
- If not, how to draw line 10. 
Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites 11. 
Do we intend guidelines to be used by regulators and requirements-setters (e.g., in companies)? 
12. Accessibility vs. usability 13. 
Conformance - why do it? 
How to test? 
14. 
Author and user needs conflict 15. 
User and user needs conflict added after the vote 9. Access for absolutely all? 
- If not, how to draw line Best effort? 
ie we expect less from individuals, more from collectives. 
jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web" Gregg, Here is your original list with the concensus/no concensus markings .... 
There are 15 issues. 
Two are clearly CONCENSUS. 
(8 &amp; 9) Two are partly CONCENSUS. 
( 7,13) One was discussed with NO CONCENSUS (6) . 
Ten issues remain in their original state. 
I'm a bit unclear on the meaning of the acronym URI ... I originally assumed it meant URL, but have seen it used such that it suggests it may be the web site rather than the specific page address that can contain any equivalent versions ... This was under Elephant #11 ... and if it means that a URI is a web site (an address and it's subdirectories, etal) it will neatly suit meeting the needs of all disabled persons without having to draw a line anywhere .... Anne No concensus Concensus on some, non concensus on others, no mention of needing normative.

Let's go to the latest rehash of the consensed items.? I believe that the one you are referring to is S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in the different forms and it is all available through the same URI? 
(though it may be linked to it)? 
(server side solutions are acceptable ? 
as specified) Here the extension to "somewhere on the same site" is by the parenthetical remark "though it may be linked to it." 
I had been interpreting the "from the same URI" in a strict sense and was preparing to object until this parenthetical remark sunk in.? 
There is a technique known as content negotiation in which a URL can get you different things depending on what you have set in your Accept: headers.? 
This give transparent access to alternatives. 
The point is that this level of transparency is not meant to be _required_ by the consensus, at least the way I read the way Gregg wrote it up.? If the alternative is not immediately at the same URL by transparent content negotiation, it is still conforming if the alternatives are easy to discover and navigate to, starting at that URL.? This implies that a root, home, or entry page where people are likeliest to start should be very broadly usable so that people can find their way from there to the section that is best for them. 
It's not quite true that being elsewhere on the same site is enough.? 
You have to have web-linked the site together enough, too.? But so long as the path to what you want is via well-greased skids through stuff you can use, then it's cool. 
On the technicalities, a URL is a URI, and saying 'a URI' doesn't somehow expand the reference to include the whole site.? 
There is no http://www.foo.bar/ http://www.foo.bar/* way to refer to the whole site as a URI. 
We should have a FAQ on "why do all the web specifications say URIs and all the pages contain URLs?"? Al Though one can model it quite easily in RDF:- @prefix log: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log# . 
[ log:uri [ log:startsWith http://example.org/ 
] ] . 
Not all that helpful in this context, perhaps... URL is becoming more and more of a deprecated term within the development community, and hopefully that will speard over into the "non-geek" world, although don't bet on it. 
For those still wondering what URIs and URLs are... Dan Connolly recently wrote a good piece on URIs, URI References, and all of the terminology:- - URI terminology demystified and there's more at the W3C's addressing site:- Hope that helps, Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

Ggpgmpgmh, my mail client took the quotes out. 
I meant:- [ log:uri [ log:startsWith "http://example.org/" 
] ] . 
And it means "something whose URI is something which start with the literal string 'http://example.org'". 
Cheers, Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

Al and Sean, Thanks muchly for the help. 
May I suggest that URI be used sparingly if at all in the guidelines, or perhaps used as "URI/URL" so that the non-geeks will understand what is being said. 
The audience for the guidelines includes the development community, but goes way past it.... to the non-geek development community grin ... I would also like to see other common word usages incorporated in an effort to simplify the language to reach a wider audience than the "geek" web development community. 
In the non-geek web savvy world, it's a URL .... it the non-geek web savvy world, it is a web page, not a document .... and in the non-geek web savvy world, the opening page of a site (or root URL) is the Home Page .... I'd favor use of the non-geek words as much as possible with links to the geek-world words in a glossary.... Anne Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com 
In general I am strongly in favour of using words understood by everyone, not just geeks. 
But there are cases where the terms most easily understood do not convey the meaning needed. 
"Home page" is a case in point - the part off the Web I work in has several different start pages, depending on what someone is doing. 
So no on e of them is the "home page" - there is the "AU group page", the "w3C home page", the "w3c technical reports page" and so on. 
In this case I would argue that using the term URL is wrong. 
In such cases, we are better off using the correct term, and explaining ourselves in the glossary. 
I realise that this probably comes from being deeply immersed in W3C culture, but there are sometimes deliberate decisions taken as to why W3C culture is the way it is. 
And this document is a W3C specification first and foremost.

I agree with Charles, and furthermore, as a case in point, the term URI is to be found in the glossary, if I remember correctly. 
Our documents must be accurate; correct and precise terminology is an important component of clarity and simplicity (checkpoint 3.3). 
However, we should, and do, bear in mind checkpoint 3.5 as well.
