<s> Tim, I work for Lynn Stein at Olin College on her Semantic Web research.  </s>
<s> I have been studying cwm and N3.  </s>
<s> In the course of working through some of the examples on I found that the gedcom-relations data does not work correctly.  </s>
<s> I brought this up on #rdfig and Dan Connolly pointed out that the gedcom-relations file was using old syntax.  </s>
<s> So, I revised the file and think I have one which generates correct data.  </s>
<s> The file is attached.  </s>
<s> I hope it is useful.  </s>
<s> I did not revise the Makefile in the gedcom directory, but I think it can be greatly simplified.  </s>
