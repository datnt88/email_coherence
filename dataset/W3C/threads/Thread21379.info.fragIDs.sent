In this message: it seemed that there was confusion over the correct way to indicate the type of an annotation. 
Jim Ley thought that annotations should have an rdf:type of a:Annotation and could optionally have an a:annotationType which described the annotation type in more detail. 
But the protocol page indicates that there can be two different rdf:type's. 
Can anyone clarify this?

I think there is confusion. 
In the experimental EARL server we set up at W3C the annotations do not have a type of a:Annotation (where a is the common annotea namespace) at all - they are merely EARL data. 
I suspect that it would have been more useful to make these annotations perhaps with a type that was different to the existing list (something like the Dublin Core relation element?). 
We can experiment further... Cheers Charles

Currently all annotations are of type rdf:type a:Annotation (namespace a=http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#). 
They typically also have a more specific annotation subclass type e.g. rdf:type aT:Comment (namespace aT =http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#). 
It is also possible for a group to define other annotation subtypes and use them. 
The a:Annotation could naturally be left out and just infer it from the more specific type by using the knowledge about subClassOf definition between the types. 
We have not currently done it for couple of reasons related to history and optimization.
