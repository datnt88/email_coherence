<s> I was rereading WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0203 in light of some real life application of the guidelines and I have a question regarding the requirements on table.  </s>
<s> What's the difference between:  </s>
<s> 7.2 Avoid using tables to arrange text documents in columns.  </s>
<s> and 7.4 Avoid using tables to layout a page.  </s>
<s> one is required, the other not, they both refer to layout of documents using table construct.  </s>
<s> We should be more detail if possible.  </s>
<s> 7.1 is a REQUIRED about "Associate table cells with row and column labels explicitly" This is about adding 'header' or 'scope' to the TABLE markup.  </s>
<s> I wonder if a default algorithm (or set of default values for these attributes, if you prefer) could not be described that would alleviate the needs for updating all the table markup out there.  </s>
<s> For instance, the TABLE example number 2 in the appendix adds scope=col to a bunch of TH but it looks to me that a user agent can very well infer that data from the fact that it's a bunch of TH in a TR followed by a bunch of TD in TRs.  </s>
<s> I kind of remember Dave Raggett describing such an algorithm for user agent to follow.  </s>
<s> I need to look back in the archive.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't want to make anything that can be achieved by a user agent a REQUIRED.  </s>
<s> I concur with Daniel's comments.  </s>
<s> In fact, the HTML 4.0 specification provides a default algorithm which is to be applied whenever explicit HEADERS and SCOPE attributes are not included.  </s>
<s> For the sake of simplicity, should we recommend (as a helpful, not a required guideline) that HEADERS and SCOPE be introduced in all cases, and also make it clear that HEADERS and SCOPE are required whenever the algorithm would not properly identify the headers associated with each data cell?  </s>
<s> Stated differently, the recommendation would be that authors include HEADERS and SCOPE just to ensure that the user agent will render the table correctly, but these are only really necessary where the algorithm detailed in the HTML 4.0 specification would otherwise fail.  </s>
<s> The two sections dealing with the use of tables for layout purposes can be collapsed into one, perhaps with two separate guidelines: (1) required, do not misuse tables to generate columns of text; (2) recommended, do not use tables for layout purposes at all, but take advantage of style sheet positioning instead.  </s>
<s> Until all the browsers support CSS positioning well, it's not likely that authors will abandon using tables for page layout.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have any evidence, antidotal or not of how popular Navigators LAYER tag is?  </s>
<s> The two sections dealing with the use of tables for layout purposes can be collapsed into one, perhaps with two separate guidelines: (1) required, do not misuse tables to generate columns of text; (2) recommended, do not use tables for layout purposes at all, but take advantage of style sheet positioning instead.  </s>
<s> 1. Concerning association of cells with row and column: It seems that in simple tables there is no real necessity that the author will "Associate table cells with row and column labels explicitly" The HTML4.0 spec indicates that the above mentioned association may be rendered in a speech browser by annoncing the label.  </s>
<s> If one has a table that lists people and three additional columns specify phone number, email address and office number, a user of a non-visual browser may not need a reminder for every article whether it is an email address or a phone number.  </s>
<s> So in this case, I think, an author can leave the decision about annoncing the column to the user's defaults/stylesheet (as the browser should be able to find the column on its own).  </s>
<s> On the other hand if one writes a rather complicated table with cells *spanning* over columns or rows, the correct association may very well depend on the context.  </s>
<s> In this case, it seems, that explicit association is required.  </s>
<s> 2. Layout and columns: It seems that making columns is a particular case of layout.  </s>
<s> Another example is writing a one-row two-cell table where all the text is in the second cell  </s>
<s> and the first cell is used to create indentation.  </s>
<s> Clearly, this example is not that terrible from the point of view of accesibility.  </s>
<s> However, the guidelines may be more explicit about the consequence of using tables for layout, and provide more examples.  </s>
<s> Regards, Nir Dagan.  </s>
<s> This item needs to be reclassified as an INTERIM measure.  </s>
<s> Hopefully screen readers in the near future will be able to look at the browser's document object model and read down a column, cell by cell, etc. through a table.  </s>
<s> In addition, the point needs further clarification.  </s>
<s> For example, using the TH element to produce table headers is a good idea.  </s>
<s> However, text headers will also produce multicolumn-screenreading problems.  </s>
<s> Using the hack of putting BRs at the end of each table cell changes the accessibility of multicolumn text for Lynx but not for Navigator.  </s>
<s> Does this need to be added as an interim guideline as well?  </s>
<s> What 7.2 is really saying is that for specific combinations of screen-reading software and browsers, multicolumn text of any kind is a problem.  </s>
<s> In order to give 7.2 the precision it deserves these problem combinations of browser and screen reader must be specified in the guidelines albeit maybe the longer document.  </s>
<s> Further, it would seem that one additional step would be to generate statistics on the relevant combinations of browser/screen-reader software so that we can judge over the next 2-3 years when to phase this and other interim points out.  </s>
<s> Josh Krieger CAST  </s>
<s> I think it would be helpful to indicate in the guidelines under which circumstances authors should take advantage of the HEADERS and SCOPE attributes in HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> Stated differently, in what types of situations does the algorithm prescribed in the specification for locating the headers that correspond to each cell, produce erroneous results?  </s>
<s> One such circumstance has already been mentioned in this discussion, namely, where data cells span columns.  </s>
<s> Another would presumably occur whenever the first column of the table provides what Al once aptly characterised as de facto row headers, even though the cells in question are contained in TD rather than TH elements.  </s>
<s> Are there any other situations of concern?  </s>
<s> We need to enumerate them in the guidelines, albeit briefly, and thereby advise authors when to use SCOPE and HEADERS attributes.  </s>
