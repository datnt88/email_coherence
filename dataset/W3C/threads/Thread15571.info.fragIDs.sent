<s> I think this is already covered by other guidelines and propose to delete this SC.  </s>
<s> In level 2, SC 2 of the same guideline, we require:  </s>
<s> A. The meanings and pronunciations of all words in the content can be programmatically located.  </s>
<s> Since contracted words are still words, this SC requires their meaning can be programatically located, though there may be multiple meanings for that word.  </s>
<s> In level 3, SC 2, of the same guideline, we require: B.  </s>
<s> Where a word has multiple meanings and the intended meaning is not the first in the associated dictionary(s), then additional markup or another mechanism is provided for determining the correct meaning.  </s>
<s> Combining A and B allows you to determine the meaning of contracted words.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I propose to delete the success criteria about contracted words.  </s>
<s> It may be that I'm unaware of an important accessibility barrier with contracted words that I don't do justice with this proposal.  </s>
<s> If so, please let me know what I'm missing.  </s>
<s> I have asked for examples that show accessibility problems with contracted words but haven't seen or heard any that clarified the specific accessibility problems with them for me.  </s>
<s> I understand that obscure contractions may be hard to understand, but that's true for difficult uncontracted words as well and is why we require that you can programmatically locate the meaning of every word at level 2.

<s> I do not want to argue for keeping SC1.  </s>
<s> But it is important to understand how the levels work.  </s>
<s> A guideline in a lower level will often be broader than a higher level.  </s>
<s> That does not mean the higher level item is covered by the lower level.  </s>
<s> Level 1 says some things must be done Level 2 says more things must be done (which of course includes level 1 and goes beyond.) Removing the Level 1 item because even more is required in level 2 is not appropriate logic.  </s>
<s> Thus the analysis below is incorrect.  </s>
<s> The Level 2 and Level 3 do not cover the level 1 requirement and never can -- because they arent invoked until a more advanced (high number) level of access.  </s>
<s> IF the level 1 criteria were lowered to a lower level, then indeed it would be redundant with another item at its own level - and would be 'covered.  </s>
<s> Now - having said that - we have to ask whether SC1 should be required at level one or not.  </s>
<s> I think this is a valid question.  </s>
<s> But not because it is redundant with lower levels.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what Yvette (and others) were saying was - I don't think we need SC1 at level 1.  </s>
<s> It just isnt important enough.  </s>
<s> and if moved to a lower level it would be redundant - or covered - with what we already have a lower levels.  </s>
<s> I will leave this last as an open question to the group for comment.  </s>

<s> Hello Gregg, I'm sorry but I do not follow your reasoning.  </s>
<s> The item I propose to delete is level 3, not level 1 (The meaning of contracted words can be programmatically determined).  </s>
<s> I argue that it's already covered mostly by a level 2 item and completely by that level 2 item in combination with another level 3 item.  </s>
<s> I'm not talking about level 1 items at all.  </s>
<s> I totally understand that you can't delete level 1 items because they're covered by level 2 or 3 but that's not what I'm proposing.  </s>
<s> I'm proposing to delete a level 3 SC because it's covered by a level 2+3.  </s>
<s> By the time you get to level 3, all of the level 2 items will already be covered, right?  </s>
<s> So the meaning of all words, including contracted words, can already be programatically located.  </s>
<s> I don't see why we need a level 3 item to say the meaning of contracted words can be programatically determined, since you can already locate the meaning and another level 3 item says to provide additional information if the intended meaning is not the first.  </s>
