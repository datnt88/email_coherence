<s> Could we please have a little disclaimer/note about why we used tables for layout on the home page?  </s>

<s> The new W3C home page design (at http://www.w3.org/) is in fact an example g : table summary="Layout table: The first cell contains the body of the page, the second a navigation bar." border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" Einar  </s>
<s> HTML 4.01 spec recommends style sheets for visual formatting.  </s>
<s> However, I find some difficulties in making use of CSS level 2. There are many features that popular visual browsers do not support so far.  </s>
<s> It seems that style sheets layers cannot totally replace the use of Table or Frame elements for web page layout.  </s>
<s> Is there any design guideline for layout formatting?  </s>
<s> Could you suggest any site as examples?  </s>
<s> By the way, I notice that commercial sites rely extensively on visual layout/ effects rather than providing a structured document for scientific research.  </s>
<s> Is there any commercial site of valid htmls or good design in the technical aspect?  </s>
<s> Any design guideline for this kind of application?  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> I think that calling us "hypocritical" is unfair.  </s>
<s> I am not excited about using a table for layout, believe me.  </s>
<s> Our experiments with trying to design a page that used floats and worked across different browsers on different platforms failed.  </s>
<s> We debated whether we wanted to use floats and take a stand to promote support for specifications, or to use a table and ensure that the page linearized well (as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1]).  </s>
<s> We chose the table as a practical, not purist solution.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons we created this list was to get feedback on how to improve our design, and in particular, how to get rid of the table.  </s>
<s> We hope that people will contribute ideas and that this archive will allow other people to learn about designs that "do the right thing": provide visually appealing solutions that adhere to specifications and meet the needs of all users.  </s>
