Thursday, 11 September, 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM Eastern Australia, etc.) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224, irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag Reorganization proposals: There are currently three proposals on offer. 
1. 
The latest Review draft of WCAG 2.0: 2. An initial reorganization proposal, prepared in response to teleconference discussions: 3. A third proposal, due to the joint efforts of Wendy, Cynthia and Kerstin: See the documents cited at and the explanations in that message. 
Some questions to consider in preparation for the meeting: 1. 
What problems are the reorganization proposals intended to solve? 
2. What are the differences of approach, priority and perception that are reflected in these proposals? 
Can they be reconciled? 
How can we clarify the trade-offs involved in each alternative? 
3. Which, if any, of the proposals do you favour? 
Why? 
Regrets.
