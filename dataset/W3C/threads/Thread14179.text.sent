I read the telecon minutes and it sounded like math and science (although math was only mentioned specifically) was NOT going to be considered for a guideline. 
I think it should be considered for a guideline since: 1. 
The first people who may be required the guidelines are people in education and there is alot of math and science representations in education. 
2. I think math and science issues are just as important as "blinking" text and animations. 
3. Visibility is important. 
If people do not clearly see math or science issues being addressed in the guidelines document, most will probably not go looking for help in the techniques document.

I cannot think of a guideline which is specific to Maths/Science. 
In so far as the content is conveyed by images, animations, markup languages, applets and complex language, i think the problem is already addressed. 
As I recall the teleconference it was resolved that we would attempt tobroaden some of the examples away from images and towards some of the other areas, such as equations of various kinds, which are important to groups who don't have a 'guideline just for them'. 
On the other hand, Historians are not represented very well either. 
I don't think the argument that visibility is important beats the argument that accurately reflecting the requirements for accessibility as concisely as possible is the best approach for these guidelines. 
Getting people to read the guidelines, and interpreting them for specific groups, seems to me primarily the responsibility of the Education and Outreach group, once the Guidelines group has given them the best possible material. 
It may be that the EO group requests the PAGL group to produce a specific interpretation for some group such as chemistry teachers, but that seems to be beyond the scope of the current PAGL group.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative - http://www.w3.org/WAI 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA I agree that it would become difficult to try to have specific items for every interest group. 
While science is maybe too specific for the current guidelines, I think at least the issue of math is broader and used by many groups. 
I think at least math should be considered for a guideline. 
The guidelines will be used extensively and I think we want people to get this item right for the previously stated reasons. 
If math is burried in the techniques document many people may not find the information they need to do math correctly. 
Jon P.S. By the way charles do you have a history degree?

I think we identified someplaces where a discussion of including Mathematical content could be included within the Guidelines document. 
I still don't see a Guideline which relates to Math. 
Maybe a Checkpoint.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative - http://www.w3.org/WAI 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA There are two issues related to math in the guidelines. 
Issue 1: The specific recommendations on how to author mathematical representations. 
Issue 2: Where will the recommendations appear in the guidelines. 
Will there be a guideline (primary document) directly referencing math, or will math be mentioned only in the techniques document( examples of how to do things)? 
In the later approach the primary guidelines document would probably have no mention of math. 
Jon This thread is confusing me. 
Maybe it's just the semantics. 
I do not consider "math" to belong to any particular interest group. 
Even historians use math on occasion. 
Math and scientists use it more, but... My understanding of the latest conversation is that people writing "math" should use mathML. 
If they use images instead, they should reproduce the math as LaTeX. 
Am I correct here? 
I have no major problem with this recommendation. 
My only concern is that authors who don't know LaTeX (e.g. probably most historians) might just ignore the recommendation, but if the recommendation were broadened to permit words as a less desireable alternative, they might not ignore it.

John Gardner The working group members that participated in the teleconference call last week concluded that math needs to be mentioned in the guidelines document. 
The issue that seems to be in dispute is whether we need to create a checkpoint that is specific to math issues. 
It was my understanding from the call last week that people did not think we needed a checkpoint specific to math, but that we would: 1. sprinkle references to math in the guidelines document and 2. elaborate on techniques in the techniques document. 
In order for people to easily find those techniques from the guidelines document, we decided to mention math in two places in particular: 1. 
In the introduction to A, mention MathML (and SMIL) where we discuss the flexibility of HTML, XML and other W3C technologies. 
2. A.1.1 - include a link to a section on using images to represent math equations. 
This would link to a discussion in the techniques about how to write alt-text and descriptions for mathematical equations presented as graphical images. 
In the techniques document, we will include a link to the MathML specification in our list of references, as well as create a section to elaborate on techniques for including math in Web documents. 
Therefore, at no time have we said that we would not mention math at all in the guidelines document, we are just not sure where to mention it and how. 
I believe that to be the main issue at hand. 
Thoughts? 
--wendy I don't see any reason to single out "Math" and "Science" in the Guidelines. 
What particular accessibility issues do they raise? 
What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy or Art History? 
I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads something like: "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example mathematical equations) instead of using images, use a markup language." 
Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about using MathML to mark up math content.

This was about what I had in mind, more eloquently expressed. 
(But that's what I expect from Ian.) Charles McCN I don't see any reason to single out "Math" and "Science" in the Guidelines.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative - http://www.w3.org/WAI 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA It is an accessibility issue here at UIUC as instructors put more math and science information on the WWW. 
There is no immediate solution to marking up math (until MathML rendering technologies become more available) or science markup (maybe someday there will be markup languages). 
It would be nice to have a central reference point on how people should do this now and what to do in the future, especially to potentially make the markup easily translatable to other forms like tactile graphics and nemith Braille representations. 
Dr. Gardner at Oregon State has done alot of work in this area would be a good reference. 
But it seems that I have struck a dissonant cord with the group (at least the W3C staff in the group) that this is not an important enough topic for inclusion in the guidelines, except as examples of how images are occasionally used.

The only unique aspect, so far as markup is concerned, is the mathematical notation; and we have already devised solution strategies in this area, namelY: Interim: where images are used to convey mathematical content, provide an equivalent markup notation (E.G. TeX) as alternative text. 
2. Use MathML to represent mathematics. 
These requirements can be absorbed into the existing guidelines. 
I agree with Charles that what is needed is at most a checkpoint or two, and not a separate guideline. 
The second point, concerning alternative text, can be added as a checkpoint to A1: "Until the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) is widely supported by browsers, images, accompanied by alternative text, may be used to represent mathematical content. 
In such cases, the ALT text should convey the mathematical symbols using a human-readable markup notation, E.G. TeX." (Priority 1). 
Explanation of priority: the information will be inaccessible if the the alternative text is not included. 
Second suggestion, under guideline A14, provide either (1) an informative, non-exhaustive list of W3C technologies: "Note: W3C technologies include HTML, XML, CSS, XSL, MathML, Smil, etc.", or (2) a link to such an informative list, maintained in the techniques document or elsewhere. 
The list should include MathML just for the sake of reinforcing its importance. 
It could even be included briefly in the statement of guideline A14: "(E.G. HTML, CSS, XSL, XML, MathML, SMIL, etc.)". 
Having re-read Charles' comments, I would be willing to agree with the proposal to include mention of MathML in the introduction to Section A, rather than in A14 as discussed in my previous message. 
Either approach would be fine.
