Two problems, working in a text file: 1. 
I'm having no luck at all with the [Ctrl] + F search-and-replace function. 
It just never works, period. 
Strange. 
2. Selecting words in a line, using [Ctrl]+[Shift]+{[LeftArrow] or [RightArrow]}, I find that the "...+[RightArrow] function initial selects TWO words instead of one. 
One then has to do a [LeftArrow] to get the cursor where it should be in the first place. 
I'm working on a WinXP machine.

My environment is Amaya 8.3 and Windows 98: A] Ctrl-F [Search/Replace] works for me Check to make sure you are in EDIT mode. 
When edit mode was turned off, i could duplicate your result B] Ctrl-Shift-Right Arrow selects TWO words at a time !!! but Ctrl-Shift-Left Arrow selected only one word .... but this operation still needs repair !!!
