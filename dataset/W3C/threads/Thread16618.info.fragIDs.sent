<s> Hi all - I have a question about the accessibility of user controls that automatically update a page.  </s>
<s> Some search engines will allow a user to click on a button or link called "more" to retrieve additional information about the search result in question.  </s>
<s> Often this will load a new page with the description or a JavaScript function to pop-up a second window.  </s>
<s> My question is this: is there a problem with using that technique to load additional information in the same page with a server-side language, thereby avoiding the issues of JavaScript?  </s>
<s> The function could load additional information on the search result from the database and post the information below the result the user wanted more information about.  </s>
<s> This means the page will reload but retain the original list of search results with the additional information posted below the "parent" result.  </s>
<s> I suppose this could cause a conflict with WCAG #6.2, though I'm unsure of how this technique applies to that checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 10.1 states to "not change the current window without informing the user".  </s>
<s> My hunch is the button "more information" would alert the user that the content is to change.  </s>
<s> Using this technique could make large chunks of data - like search engine results - more manageable if the user is listening to the results.  </s>
<s> Thanks for any feedback!  </s>

<s> Hi Joel, following a link meaans that the page is expected to change (I think this is a default assumption).  </s>
