"SHOULD" is clearly not going to get Netscape to support Digest. 
The only thing that we can *hope* will get Netscape to support Digest is the threat of slapping "HTTP/1.1 uncompliant" on them publicly and hope it shames them into supporting it. 
Is it true that Netscape opposes Digest? 
Why? 
Is there anybody from Netscape on the list who can comment on this? 
Failing that, is there anybody not from Netscape who's willing to offer a hypothesis?

The story I heard blamed lack of cycles, but that tends to be the way for every extension that they don't think up in house. 
For a long time Netscape refused to contemplate tables claiming they were unnecessary. 
They have dragged their feet on maths markup for years claiming "nobody wants it". 
What was somewhat ammusing was when Marc stood up to explain his "discovery" that the Web could be used as an Intranet collaboration tool, I think a guy in Geneva had a similar idea at some time:-) Phill Nobody wants "x-gzip" or "x-compress" in the Mac/Windows world either. 
Why else would they still refuse to add it, forcing users of those platforms to jump through hoops to use compressed information they download from the web... the very people who will have the most trouble finding a hoop to jump through.
