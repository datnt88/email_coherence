Hi, During one of the IETF deltav breakout sessions I was "challenged" to try to find a way to draw ASCII art to show the resources and relationships involved in baseline creation (and still have it fit in 72 columns). 
The idea being we could include this in the specification to clarify the relationship between baseline-controlled collections, version-controlled configurations, and baselines etc. 
Here are my two possible candidates (I think I prefer the first one): |Baseline- | DAV:version-controlled-configuration |Controlled |----------+ |Collection | | |/src/applet | | |Version- |--------+ |Controlled | DAV:baseline-controlled-collection |Configuration | |/vcc/src/1 |----+ DAV:checked-in +-- |Baseline | DAV:baseline-collection +-- |/blh/1/b1 | | |Baseline | | | |History |-----------+ | +-----------------+ | DAV:root-version | |Collection | |/blh/1 | | | | +---------+ +--- |/blh1/1/b1/bc | Here is my second attempt..... |Baseline-Controlled Collection | |/src/applet | |DAV:version-controlled-configuration |-----+ |Version-Controlled Configuration | | |/vcc/src/1 | | |DAV:baseline-controlled-collection |-------+ |DAV:checked-in |----+ |Baseline History | v |/blh/1 | |Baseline | |DAV:root-version |------ |/blh1/1/b1 | |DAV:baseline-collection|------+ v |Collection | |/blh1/1/b1/bc | For either diagram I would suggest some surrounding text something like: "This diagram shows the collection identified by /src/applet has been placed under baseline control, creating a new version-controlled configuration (/vcc/src/1), new baseline history (/blh/1), new baseline (/blh/1/b1) and a new collection (/blh/1/b1/bc). 
The new collection has members whose checked-in versions capture the state of the /src/applet collection at the time the baseline-control method was processed. 
When /vcc/src/1 is checked-out and checked-in new baselines and collections are created to take another snapshot of the checked-in state of the resources in /src/applet." 
Does the group have any preference as to either of these, do you think it helps clarify the baseline feature? 
Did I get anything wrong?

Thanks, Peter! 
I decided I liked version 2 better than version 1 (I think it did a better job of displaying bi-directional relationships). 
I of course had to muck around with it at least a bit (:-), and here's what I ended up with: |Baseline-Controlled Collection | ------+ |/src | | |DAV:version-controlled-configuration +---+ | |Version-Controlled Configuration | --+ | |/repo/vcc/128 | | |DAV:baseline-controlled-collection +-------+ |DAV:checked-in +-------+ |DAV:version-history +---+ | |Baseline History | ---------------+ | |/repo/blh/13 | | |DAV:version-set +----------------+ | v | v v | |Baseline | -------+-----------+ |/repo/blh/13/ver/8 | |DAV:baseline-collection +---- |Collection | +------------------------+ |/repo/bc/15 | Let me know if this is OK.

Hi Geoff, You changes to the diagram mainly look fine, the main difference is that your diagram shows multiple baselines (eg versions in the version-set), mine was trying to show the state after the initial BASELINE-CONTROL in which case there would only be the root-version and one version in the version-set.
