The shorter length of most of the names is good. 
I really don't understand why x and y size for the display were separated. 
I can't really see caching using Vary based only on x or y. 
So, I'd suggest: UA-pix: x-size x y-size because it's shorter and no significant loss of functionlity. 
I also don't understand the rationale behind UA-media- type introducing many extra header names, instead of UA-media: type which seems like it works just as well conceptually, and fits perfectly into Vary based caching. 
Bottom line -- I'd like it to be more like it was before, but with the shorter names. 
Redmond, WA 98052 The new draft of draft-mutz-http-attributes is now available at: ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-mutz-http-attributes-01.txt 
Most of the syntax changes in the draft are to provide compliance with the transparent content negotiation method for features described in: draft-holtman-pre02-19.txt. 
It's not possible to supply more than one numeric argument, or any non-numeric argument to features. 
UA-pix was broken into two numeric arguments, and UA-media was split into a set of unique feature tags. 
I would like to see non-numeric values for feature tags allowed.

| UA-media-screen is inadequate to distinguish between scrolling and paged UI presentations. 
This is needed to obtain different versions of documents or style sheets etc. according to the presentation type. 
I suggest that the list of media tokens is extended to allow UA-media-screen-paged with UA-media-screen being taken to imply a scrolling presentation.

I don't believe I understand the issues a non-scrolling display raises when interacting with other attributes such as screen size. 
If for example, the available vertical size of the URL is longer than the size of the display, how is this resolved? 
Is a paged resource with pages longer than requested better or worse than a vertically long resource? 
How does one calculate the vertical length of a resource when local treatment of fonts will cause the length to vary? 
I agree non-scrolling displays are relevant and the tag UA-media-screen-paged will be added to the draft.

| Andy Mutz: I'll put non-numeric values in the next transparent content negotiation draft. 
Your UA-media-* tag family is an excellent example of why they need to exist. 
It is much nicer, and more efficient, to say Accept-Features: UA-media=stationary than it is to say Accept-Features: UA-media-stationary, !UA-media-screen if you are going to print the response on stationary paper. 
Where appropriate, I'll rewrite the examples in my transparent content negotiation draft to use your feature tags. 
I plan to submit an updated transparent negotiation draft as an internet draft soon.
