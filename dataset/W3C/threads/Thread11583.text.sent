Appel aux r?viseurs. 
Bonne nouvelle : le premier jet de notre traduction d'XML 1.0 est maintenant complet ! 
Le r?sultat est visible en http://babel.alis.com/web_ml/xml/REC-xml.fr.html . 
La grammaire, maintenant compl?tement 
traduite, se trouve sur http://babel.alis.com/web_ml/xml/REC-xml-gramr.html . 
Le texte est maintenant beaucoup plus lisible avec la grammaire traduite. 
Par exemple, on peut dire ? 
Le Nom dans une D?clEntit? 
est... ? 
comme l'anglais, au lieu de devoir dire ? 
Le nom (Name) dans une d?claration d'entit? 
(EntityDecl) est...? Une proposition de terminologie a ?galement 
?t? ?labor?e voir : http://babel.alis.com/web_ml/xml/termino.html . 
Nous avons contact? 
quelqu'un au W3C pour savoir o? irait cette traduction. 
P. A. Hello Patrick, Many thank for your anouncement. 
I'm writing back in English because some of the people on the cc line don't understand French. 
Congratulations to the translation at I will be very glad to add a pointer to it from the XML home page as soon as I get to it, and as soon as you have fixed a few points: Please add the required text, in the required form according to http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate, at the beginning/end of the translation. 
For a very good example, please e.g. see http://www.mintert.com/xml/trans/REC-xml-19980210-de.html. 
When you do that, please make sure to put the translators into that section. 
Regarding the translated grammar at also looks very interesting and useful. 
However, it does give the impression of being (the translation of) an official W3C document, which it isn't. 
Please immediately add an appropriate disclaimer, and contact us privately to figure out what we can do about this. 
Also, thanks for sending this anouncement in French; this made me aware that we probably have to change our FAQ slightly. 
With kind regards, Martin.

since I don't know where it goes) DL should be reserved for definition lists, e.g. glossaries. 
Strictly speaking, the title page has no definition list. 
Correect E.g., the *term* "This version" is not defined by the string/hyperlink "http://.....". 
And, the *term* "Authors" is not defined by "Hakon Lie". 
True, "Hakon Lie" may be the author, but the *term* "author" has significance beyond someone's name. 
Right. 
Hakon does not *define* the author. 
Hakon is an instance of author, for this document. 
The table element does not come with any implied semantic. 
Yes it does; it comes with the semantics of rows and columns. 
So, using it for layout (eg, image slicing) is table abuse. 
Lets look at Hakons table to see if it is a real table or an abusive table. 
Each row describes a particular item of information (it is a tuple). 
Latest version has this URI. 
Current version has this URI Last version has this URI Editor is this person-list Author is this person-list Now lets do it by columns. 
The first column is a status, title, something like that. 
The second column is - erm, two different sorts of things. 
Lets split that into two tables. 
The first table has Latest version has this URI. 
Current version has this URI Last version has this URI The second table has Editor is this person-list Author is this person-list OK that is better. 
The first table is a spec version table. 
Each row refers to a particular version. 
The first column is the version identifier and the second column is the URI for that version. 
The second table is a human resources table. 
Each row refers to a particular type of human resource (editor, author, others could be added with the same sense such as translator, whatever...) The first column identifies the type of human resource. 
The second column lists the people who are of that type. 
Yes, given the split, these are both actual tables. 
They could be given captions. 
They could be rotated 90 degrees and retain semantics. 
Rows and columns have consistent semantics. 
No semantics is better than wrong semantics. 
But correct semantics is better yet. 
Besides: you're not following: -- http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/#gl-table-markup OK, it meets the priority one guideline. 
Incidentally it seems odd that there is no guideline to *not* use tables for layout!!! instead it says, when using tables for layout, do this. 
I find that odd, but there we are. 
It meets the second but not the first priority two guideline. 
To meet the other one it would need to have headings to identify what the columns mean. 
It doesn't meet the first priority three guideline and the second priority three guideline doesn't apply here (because there are no long headings to abbreviate) Hakon, could youdo the following to your template: a) split the table into two as desribed b) add the summary attribute for each table. 
For the first one, summary="This table shows the different versions of this specification and gives the URI for each one". 
For the second, summary="This table shows the various roles that people have played in contributing to this specificatuion, and lists the people who played each role" That gives us semantic tables which meet a goodly proportion of the WAI guidelines for tables. 
The summary attributes should not need editing for different specifications - they are tables witha semantic meaning which persists across specifications. 
To go the extra mile: c) add headers for each table: @media screen, print, tv { .version-head, 
.role-head 
{display: none } @media aural, emboss, braille, tty { .version-head, 
.role-head 
{display: table-row } tr class="version-head" /tr tr class="role-head" /tr d) add markup to identify the appropriate headers: for each row tr td headers="v1" This version /td td headers="v2" a href="uri" uri /a /td /tr or in the other table tr td headers="r1" Editor /td td headers="r2" Joe Bloggs /td /tr Chris From w3c-html-wg-request@w3.org Thu Feb 11 01:37 JST 1999 #-#-# Martin J.

: Please don't do that now, this translation is unfinished, even apart from the points you raise. 
Patrick's announcement had the words "premier jet", which means "first draft" and which those who are likeky to read the translation will have understood. 
Your points will be addressed, of course. 
Knowing such things was the reason I contacted Ian in the first place. 
This info is not really easy to find on the Web site, and Ian gave me useful pointers.
