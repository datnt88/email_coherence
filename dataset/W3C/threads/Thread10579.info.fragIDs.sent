Would all editors please look over their docs and/or diffs and let me know ASAP if there's anything terribly wrong with them? 
I've done various edits to get links to point to the right places (and in a few cases as requested) and it's possible I broke something in the process. 
The cost of changes is very high, but if I broke anything, I do want to fix it. 
RDF: OWL: Note that all the links like are fine; they will be rewritten to point to the frozen-in-time TR documents as the documents are moved.

Sandro, I've spent a few hours looking into them and haven't found "anything terribly wrong with them" :) Nice work!

Sandro, I checked it and everything looks good. 
Thanks, Ian
