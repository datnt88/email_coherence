irc: irc.w3.org #rdfcore 1: Volunteer scribe 2: Roll Call 3: Next telecon 14 Mar 2003 1000 Boston Time Volunteer Scribe 4: Apology Apologies to the WG that this is a cursory agenda without the usual links etc. 
A combination of the W3C site being down and backlog of work after the tech plenary means I didn't have the time to do better. 
5: Issues to be considered see: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/ reagle-01 XMLLiteral equality reagle-02 exc-c14n throughout pfps-14 Social Meaning hendler-01 literals in parsetype collection hodder-01 RDF in HTML krech-01 emptyPropertyElt ambiguity jjc-01 rdfms-nested-bagIDs/test007.rdf pfps-15 Say anything quote danc-03 rdf/xml reification examples pfps-17 namespace v vocabulary 
bwm believes there were more that folks promised but these are not recorded in the irc log. 
6: Issues to be considered next meeting This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant, running on Jena 2 
If there is time I would like some discussion of the RDF URI reference vs IRI issue. 
I am minded to propose a global renaming of RDF URI reference and uriref to IRI and defer to namespaces 1.1; and would like some idea of how much that is a lead balloon. 
I still need input from I18N-WG on this.

Date was wrong in original Brian 
The number above is incorrect. 
The correct dail-in number for Tobin is eric miller http://www.w3.org/people/em/ semantic web activity lead http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ w3c world wide web consortium http://www.w3.org/ 
Just for the record, I believe the date should be Tue Mar 11 2003. 
I expect to join about 30 minutes late due to a family commitment.
