<s> Is it expected that you should be able to BIND a lock-null resource?  </s>
<s> I am in the process of trying to come up with a software design for the programmers here to implement WebDAV (first) and then DeltaV (later).  </s>
<s> We want to build a fairly generic lump of code to do all the protocol messing around with a fairly clean and simplified to the underlying 'file system of resources'.  </s>
<s> So far I have put the LOCK mechanisms into the WebDAV library layer (because they are based on URIs).  </s>
<s> I am also trying to keep the 'lock-null' resource concept in the WebDAV layer since they are tightly related to locks.  </s>
<s> My current proposal is to keep track of lock-null resources with properties that have been set and then copy those properties over to the real resource when it is created later (if I have understood things correctly).  </s>
<s> I realise BIND is not in the base WebDAV spec, but I want to keep what is done future proof.  </s>
<s> There are two variations of questions I guess I have.  </s>
<s> (1) Does the spec prohibit BIND-ing to a lock-null resource?  </s>
<s> (OK, I am being lazy and have not reread the spec again to verify this question - but the next question is the real question)  </s>
<s> (2) Regardless of the spec, do people think its acceptable to fail BIND requests to a lock-null resource with an error?  </s>
<s> (Is there any reason why someone would want to do it before doing a PUT or MKCOL etc?)  </s>
<s> Alan ps: Thanks to all for time spent answering these questions.  </s>
<s> Interesting question.  </s>
<s> Since it is a resource, it makes sense that you can bind to it.  </s>
<s> So I'd say, yes.  </s>
<s> But, I'd understand if servers decided to fail such a request.  </s>
<s> I just gave it a quick look, and it seems like the BIND protocol specification does not mention lock null resources.  </s>
<s> I think this is fine.  </s>

<s> Interesting question.  </s>
<s> Since it is a resource, it makes sense that you can bind to it.  </s>
<s> I disagree (strongly :-).  </s>
<s> There are a large variety of things that you cannot do to a lock null resource.  </s>
<s> BIND should be one of them.  </s>
<s> (In fact, just about everything should be one of them :-).  </s>
<s> A lock null resource is just a mechanism (hack :-) to expose a URL that is locked but that currently is not bound to a resource.  </s>
<s> If you want to see just how bad the lock null mechanism really is, just compare any two implementations of lock null resources, and notice how different/non-interoperable they are.  </s>
<s> So I'd say, yes.  </s>
<s> But, I'd understand if servers decided to fail such a request.  </s>
<s> I'd say "no", and all servers should be required to fail such a request.  </s>
<s> I just gave it a quick look, and it seems like the BIND protocol specification does not mention lock null resources.  </s>
<s> That is an omission (somewhat conscious, because I try to ignore lock null resources in hopes that they will be replaced with a more sensible form of lock discovery).  </s>
<s> If it looks like we can't make lock null resources go away, we need to update the BIND protocol to explicitly disallow binding to a lock null resource.  </s>
<s> More than acceptable, commendable (:-).  </s>
