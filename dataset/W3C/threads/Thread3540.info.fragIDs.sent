I have found the following issue with regards to using HTTP Accept-Language: for determining the locale of a user: The way HTTP matches language ranges and language tags is described in Section 14.4 of RFC 2616 (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4): 
Accept-Language: en matches Content-Language: en-us but Accept-Language: en-us does no match Content-Language: en This means that browsers should send general things such as 'en' rather than the more specific labels such as 'en-us', or both. 
But for using this to determine a locale, the more specific, the better.

I'm confused. 
In that section, I see: 
A language-range matches a language-tag if it exactly equals the tag, or if it 
exactly equals a prefix of the tag such that the first tag character following the prefix is "-".

I think Martin's point is: when setting Accept-Language to get the best match for locale selection, you want the most specific tag (en-Latn-US-boont). 
When setting Accept-Language to get the best match for language content selection, you want the least specific tag for the job (en). 
In the Web services sphere this enhances the argument for not using the transport's metadata structure and for the creation of a WS-International type standard. 
In passing, I should note that the extension mechanism is our Internet-Draft helps bridge this gap: locale extensions are ignored in that context, so one can specify a less exact language and yet still add locale ornamentation to the tag.

It is not a feature.

A language-range matches a language-tag if it exactly equals the tag, or 
Earlier, it explains that what you send with Accept-Language is a language range, but what the document knows of itself (e.g. as expressed in Content-Language) is a language tag. 
So the matching results below are correct.
