<s> I have found the following issue with regards to using HTTP Accept-Language: for determining the locale of a user: The way HTTP matches language ranges and language tags is described in Section 14.4 of RFC 2616 (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4):  </s>
<s> Accept-Language: en matches Content-Language: en-us but Accept-Language: en-us does no match Content-Language: en This means that browsers should send general things such as 'en' rather than the more specific labels such as 'en-us', or both.  </s>
<s> But for using this to determine a locale, the more specific, the better.  </s>

<s> In that section, I see:  </s>

<s> I think Martin's point is: when setting Accept-Language to get the best match for locale selection, you want the most specific tag (en-Latn-US-boont).  </s>
<s> When setting Accept-Language to get the best match for language content selection, you want the least specific tag for the job (en).  </s>
<s> In the Web services sphere this enhances the argument for not using the transport's metadata structure and for the creation of a WS-International type standard.  </s>
<s> In passing, I should note that the extension mechanism is our Internet-Draft helps bridge this gap: locale extensions are ignored in that context, so one can specify a less exact language and yet still add locale ornamentation to the tag.  </s>
