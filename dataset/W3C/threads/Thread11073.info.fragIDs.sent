Four words: REPLY TO THE GROUP 
This list is bloody near impossible to read and in danger of buckling under its own weight, and unless some of the people learn the basic net skill of replying to the group, not just hitting "reply to all", so I don't get two #!$^@ copies of everything in a thread I may have originated 3 months ago, I will ask the chair simply to remove them. 
If they do not have sufficient technical competence to engage in basic email dialogue, they have no role in helping to design Internet protocols of the future. 
You know who you are. 
I'm serious.

[Tim Bray:] 
You know, I'm so sick of this behavior and of people's arrogant disregard of all the polite requests we've made to change it that I'm ready to agree to this. 
We can't reliably change the list machinery, and if we could, the only alternative would be to have messages go by default to the list. 
This sounds like a big improvement right up to the point where you accidentally mail something to the list that you intended to be private, and then you see that it's really by far the worse of the two alternatives. 
I takes me, using a completely primitive vt100 mail tool, less than and to put the name of the person I'm quoting at the beginning of my 
reply. 
If you're not willing to put this much effort into your postings then either they are not worth sending or you are not worth having on the list. 
We do in fact have a process in place for removing people from this list. 
I agree with Tim that it's time to start using it in the case of people who deliberately conduct themselves in a way that creates unnecessary work for the rest of us. 
Jon 
I agree that being conscious of how much of other people's time you consume when you send email is important. 
And it's probably best to optimize for the convencience of the editor as opposed to the average participant in this forum. 
But "lack of technical competence" reflects on both sides of the conversation. 
It's not all that difficult to arrange for duplicates to be eliminated automatically. 
For example, the following three lines in my .procmailrc 
eliminate duplicates: #duplicates :0 Wh: msgid.lock 
formail -D 8192 msgid.cache 
And now, just for you, Tim, the relevant verse from the little red book. 
On working efficiently in groups: The original vision of the World Wide Web carried a deep social agenda of empowering individuals, increasing society's efficiencies, and exploiting computer power in everyday lives, the creator of the Web told the Sixth International World Wide Web conference today. 
Berners-Lee: Consider the people By Tim Clark April 11, 1997 Santa Clara, California or in slide presentation form: Goals of the Web Personal empowerment Social efficiency, understanding and harmony Exploitation of computing power in real life Dan Connolly, Architecture Domain Lead 
I would say that outbursts like this do far more damage to the group. 
I would suggest that you too, take note of the subject line. 
I do not consider duplicates a case of arrogance at all. 
I deal with them. 
I do consider Tim's and your message to come very close to crossing the line though. 
We are all serving the purpose of this group, and thereby serving the group. 
No-one should have unilateral control of the group, nor the right to *demand* the group in general to conform to a policy. 
The right to *ask* for certain behaviours is reserved for all, of course. 
Some of us are extraordinarily busy. 
I get over 200 email messages a 
*day*, so I can guarantee that at times I will not edit headers. 
If 
you believe that I have nothing worth contributing to the group, remove me now. 
This is only netiquette in your opinion. 
I don't appreciate being threatened or bullied into following your choice of behavior as if it was the only acceptable one. 
Not everyone is doing it out of incompetence, arrogance, or simply to annoy you. 
I have always (for over ten years) cc'd a list on replies to the sender as a matter of courtesy, reliability, and to give the sender a bit of a time advantage over the list delay. 
I'll try to remember that you prefer not being replied to, but the world (nor this list) doesn't come to an end depending on whether two messages arrive in your or my inbox. 
If they have the same message ID, delete one, and if that is too onerous a manual task, automate that deletion. 
Maybe 'LIGHTEN UP' is a better subject here. 
I think threatening to remove people from the discussion list because they don't follow your preferred method of messaging doesn't exactly promote the healthy, professional exchange which you seem so keen to advocate.

Jon's mail and my mail overlapped. 
I hope my suggestion was useful to some people, but lest anyone think that it's authoritative in any way, it's not. 
Jon is the chair of this forum. 
Dan Connolly 
[Gavin Nicol:] 
If you're looking for sympathy, you came to the wrong place. 
I get that many messages, too. 
A lot of us do. 
We manage to maintain a certain level of consideration for other people anyway. 
The key question is whether you occasionally forget or whether you have a deliberate policy of creating duplicate copies of your messages. 
The former is understandable; the latter is a conscious decision to trade off a few seconds of care on your part for a considerable amount of overhead on the part of those of us who have to maintain mail archives. 
Our process doesn't work that way. 
Section 2.1 says: Members of the SGML WG serve for the life of the WG unless they withdraw from participation, are withdrawn by the W3C member organization that appointed them, or are removed by an absolute two-thirds majority vote of the SGML ERB. 
You have to be enough of a pain in the butt to justify our taking the time to go through this. 
What Tim's posting made me realize is that some people are being inconsiderate enough that I might actually entertain such a proposal if he were to make it. 
Jon 
OK, I've done some checking with our W3C contact, Dan Connolly, about the possibility of changing the behavior of the list mailer so that replies will default to the group rather than to the individual sender. 
His reply was twofold: 1. 
It can be done. 
2. He recommends against it. 
a. It causes problems. 
For details, see 
b. Those problems will end up in the list maintainer's lap. 
I happen to have the dubious honor of being the list maintainer. 
Even though I personally think that changing the behavior of the mailer is the wrong thing to do, and even though it looks like it may create extra work for me, in order to settle this once and for all (we have had this discussion several times over the last few months) I will let the WG decide this issue. 
It's your list, and you should have the right to decide (within its technological limits) how it behaves. 
Here's the deal: 1. Read http://www.miranova.com/~steve/reply-to-harmful.html and consider what it has to say very carefully. 
This is linked to from Item 1 on the Smartlist FAQ (http://www.mindwell.com/smartlist/), 
and the implication is that what it has to say is the Conventional Wisdom among list administrators on this subject. 
2. After you have considered the pros and cons, send me PRIVATE mail (not to the list) under the heading of this message containing the single word YES (change the behavior of the list so that the default response is to the list rather than the individual) or NO (keep things the way they are). 
Please end the current discussion on the list itself. 
3. I will count all of the votes received on this question Sunday night (June 8) and let Dan know what we want to do. 
The implications are: a. 
If you decide YES, you want to change the behavior of the mailer, then I am going to ignore any kind of crud that the mailer sends me about any problems it might be having as a result of this. 
I don't know what kind of crud that could be, I'm just telling you in advance that whatever it is is going to go straight into /dev/null, and if as a result of that you end up being automatically unsubscribed (or whatever bizaare behavior may eventuate from this), that's just too doggone bad. 
b. 
If you decide NO, then that is the end of it. 
And, within the constraints of the process we've set up for this, the end of anyone who persists in continually and deliberately (as opposed to occasionally and accidentally) copying individuals on mail intended for the list. 
Vox populi, vox dei. 
Your call. 
Jon 
I apologize for perpetuating this, but I don't think that the question being asked is broad enough. 
Notice that the author of this document repeatedly cites the "group reply" feature of "elm" which I accidentally used today. 
It caused one of the series of messages that triggered Tim's tirade. 
This web page author seems to think that the use of this feature is completely normal and appropriate. 
If you prohibit the use of it (or make it more difficult), then many of the the arguments in that web page are rendered moot. 
I urge a third choice -- a three way vote. 
"Let the receiver deal with it." 
Although I try *on this list* to observe the list-recommended behaviour, on other lists I merely hit group reply (as recommended in the URL you prescribe). 
I for one would rather filter duplicates 
(automatically ore manually) than continue struggling to change deeply ingrained habits. 
This problem is so common (and controversial) that filters strike me as the best way to handle it. 
I think it *is* useful to be able to have messages that are responses to mine flagged as such by software. 
The "group reply" feature allows this. 
"Throwing away" the information of who the reply is really to goes against the SGML philsophy. 
=) =) =) Let the client's processing specfication deal with it. 
Paul Prescod 
How many copies of Marion Elledge's GCA announcement did you receive? 
So far, delete has been sufficient. 
I'd say most of us get around 200 messages a day. 
So much for seeing The Lost World. 
Or, as Murray says, to give the sender the advance of a few hours to reply. 
Still, if one is still on the CC list or the main mail to after three months and no replies, that is probably a little lazy. 
I usually remove everyone but the list and the sender. 
And some folks could decide to pound you half to death in a parking lot one afternoon, and so it goes. 
ERBness stops at the voting booth. 
I am a PIA, but not a violent one. 
Threats are bad for our mental health and in a world where people torture children to death, blow up buildings in the name of The American Way, set fire to grandma's apartment, torture a man with a steak knife for his ATM number and $800, and on and on through the daily litany of human pain, deleting emails doesn't seem to be worth this. 
On the other hand, I for one will be more conscientious. 
We have things to do. 
This isn't one of them. 
len 
I was going to suggest this as well. 
We should have a vote to see whether most people actually care enough to evoke the somewhat draconion measures Jon and Tim wish for.
