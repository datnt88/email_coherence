<s> Hi there, I cannot decide if the following is a MUST-level requirement (i.e., its violation prevents RFC 2616 compliance, even conditional): 13.10 Invalidation After Updates or Deletions In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST only be performed if the host part is the same as in the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Suppose the host part is not the same as in the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Let's also assume that the device did perform an invalidation, subjecting itself to a potential DoS attack.  </s>
<s> Did the device violate a MUST-level requirement?  </s>
<s> The answer seems to depend on how you bind "only": [ ] Yes, this is a MUST-level violation because foo MUST only blah if bar implies if not bar, foo MUST NOT blah [ ] No, this is not a MUST-level violation because foo MUST only blah if bar implies just that if bar, foo MUST blah and requires nothing when bar is false ("if not bar") I suspect that the intended interpretation is "yes, this is a MUST violation".  </s>
<s> Can anybody confirm?  </s>
<s> Is there really a problem with the wording, or am I imagining an ambiguity?  </s>
<s> Thank you, Alex.  </s>

<s> I'm pretty sure that I wrote the text in 13.10 (not 100% sure), so I guess this is my problem.  </s>
<s> If you can't understand what it means, then I guess that does mean that the wording isn't sufficiently clear.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is a clearer wording: In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST NOT be performed if the host part of that URI differs from the host part in the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> This corresponds to your "[ ] Yes" alternative above.  </s>
<s> The other intepretation doesn't seem to prevent any DOS attacks.  </s>
<s> (If I had meant the other alternative, I would have written something like "foo MUST be performed if bar").  </s>
<s> Clear?  </s>

<s> Hi Jeff, Thanks for the clarification!  </s>
<s> I agree that the "[] No" interpretation would make little practical sense, but I am sure that when our test suite detects this violation, some violators would use the ambiguity as an excuse.  </s>
<s> Now I can use your response as a munition ;-).  </s>
<s> If there is a chance to update the protocol specs, I think it would be a good idea to use your new wording.  </s>
<s> I would also suggest, if I may, that the words "In order to prevent denial of service attacks," are deleted or at least isolated from the MUST requirement in a separate non-normative statement: An invalidation based on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST NOT be performed if the host part of that URI differs from the host part in the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> This restriction helps prevent denial of service attacks.  </s>
