Comments (part 2) on: The page I experimented with is at (It still needs work) The page doesn't validate! 
(Quite badly) Remove the br/ from the h1 as on other levels. 
I don't get the idea of putting the navbar in a map (client side image map). 
What's the point? 
What do you gain? 
Good idea putting the shortcut to the messages in the text. 
The date format was corrected on other pages, but not this one (still mixed-endian). 
I don't see the advantage of the bullets in the navbar. 
The 'title's in the navbar are inconsistent (see previous comments) Merge the actions 'mail' 'help' and 'search' into one line. 
You could put a search box inline here. 
Merge the start and end dates onto one line. 
Not sure of the value of the "Last message date" at the bottom. 
The hr/ at the bottom can go Steven le mer 27-03-2002 ? 
13:59, Steven Pemberton a ?crit 
: Oops, I switched from a dl list to ul but I forgot to actually switch the enclosing tags! 
Fixed. 
Good point, I'll fix it. 
This is for accessibility reason. 
See: Oops, thanks, fixed. 
They can be removed by a CSS rule. 
I don't see an advantage in them per se, but I wanted to use a list format element instead of a p with br for each entry (cleaner, easier to parse). 
Do you think it shouldn't be so? 
Is that the "Discussion threads" vs "messages by thread" point? 
Good idea, I'll try to see how that looks. 
I don't think I'll add a search box to keep the page short. 
David Booth did the same suggestion, I'll implement it. 
Not sure either. 
I'll add in the list of open issues. 
Good point.

This is weird tag abuse. 
Can anyone explain to me what the accessibility advantages are of using a client-side image map not as a client-side image map, but as a container for links? 
Why is it better than using a p or a div ? 
Steven Pemberton The idea was that large groups of links are hard to navigate through for someone accessing a page serially (e.g., who is using a keyboard to navigate serially through a set of links). 
Rather than ask the author each time to provide an "unsightly" [jump over bunch of links] link, we thought it would be useful for user agents to provide this service. 
But, we needed markup that user agents can rely on as being "markup that identifies a group of links". 
The idea was that MAP is already used to identify a group of links, that happen to have a graphical representation. 
The WAI groups that proposed the change to HTML 4.01 said "Let's use MAP for groups of links even when the representation is non-graphical, as in a group of text links." - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)
