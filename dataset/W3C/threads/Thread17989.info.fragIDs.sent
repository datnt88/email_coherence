<s> i agree that the issue of empty alternatives is an important one, and one that has oft given me pause, too... personally, i believe that the sanest technique is to follow Lynx's lead, and endow the user with the option to choose: 1. Replace un-ALTed images with a generic placeholder (i.e. [IMAGE]) 2. Replace un-ALTed images with the name of the file contained in the IMG declaration 3. Suppress (hide) un-ALTed images (i.e. render nothing)  </s>
<s> if the ALT attribute contains a null value, the user should have the following options available to him or her: 1. Replace null ALT values with generic placeholders (i.e. [IMAGE]) 2. Replace null ALT values with the name of the file contained in the IMG declaration 3. Respect null ALT values (i.e. render nothing) additionally, the author should be able to define what is meant by a quote null ALT value unquote, i.e.: ALT="" only ALT=" " only ALT="" or ALT=" " (note to speech users -- the first ALT value contains 2 sequential quotation marks; the second ALT value contains a white space) of course, the above suggestions are offered with the caveat that they do NOT apply if the un-ALTed image is part of a hyperlink... in that case, the UA could: A. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with generic placeholders (i.e.. [LINK]) B. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the TITLE of the referred URI (i.e. the text contained within the TITLE element of the document source for the page referenced by the HREF) C. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the filename of the referred document or resource D. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the URI of the referred document or resource of course, it would be of great benefit if all of the above-listed options could be toggled on and off as easily as they can be in Lynx... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
