<s> Hi all, I'd like to add an extension to mod_dav that provides a live property that can be queried/set, which corresponds to "executable" permissions in a Unix file system.  </s>
<s> Joe Orton has also said he'd provide the corresponding capability on the client.  </s>
<s> We just need to settle on How To Do It Right, so I'll come here to ask... :-) The scenario for this is uploading a CGI script.  </s>
<s> When the script is first placed, it won't have the executable flags turned on.  </s>
<s> The client then follows up with a PROPPATCH to turn the flags on.  </s>
<s> So... I've got a few questions here:  </s>
<s> * is there a more general semantic to use?  </s>
<s> e.g. all permission types rather than just executable?  </s>
<s> * this doesn't really feel like an ACL -- this is actually stating "this resource should be executable", rather than adjusting who can interact (and how) with the resource * should I place this into the DAV: namespace, or use a private one?  </s>
<s> (I'd use http://www.webdav.org/props/ if DAV: wasn't appropriate) Other comments/suggestions appreciated, as always!  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> This is my worry.  </s>
<s> Are people going to come along and say "But I want my scripts to be chmod 0700" (or whatever)?  </s>
<s> I'm more tempted by a "unix-permissions" type property, and allowing access to the real file permissions as an octal value.  </s>
<s> Regards, joe  </s>
<s> Caught by the spam filter -- I've added Russ to the accept2 list.  </s>
<s> - Jim Russ Pridemore It seems to me that this issue could best be dealt with by the DAV server configuration instead of depending on clients.  </s>
<s> A developer working with Windows systems for both client and server could neglect to set this property and see no ill effects.  </s>
<s> Until the product shipped and someone tried their client with a UNIX server.  </s>

<s> Here's the slippery slope.  </s>
<s> What is really needed are more than just executable permissions.  </s>
<s> But, creating just a Unix permissions property doesn't handle interoperability very well, since it doesn't map especially well to non-Unix filesystems.  </s>
<s> Then, once you start looking at the needed access permissions for DAV, you realize that the ability to create a resource, then share it with other users is also important.  </s>
<s> Next thing you know, you're dealing with just about the same set of issues as are in the access control draft.  </s>
<s> Yaron's been promising a new revision of the ACL spec.  </s>
<s> for some time now, and I'm anxiously awaiting it.  </s>
<s> If you have other ideas on how this should work, please write them up in either a mail message, or better yet, an Internet-Draft.  </s>
<s> Heck, even writing up the Unix permissions property idea would be useful, since it would act as a good null-hypothesis to anything else we come up with.  </s>
