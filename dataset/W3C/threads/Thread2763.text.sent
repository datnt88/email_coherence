Section 8.1.1 may come across as slightly biaised, because it lists only advantages of persistent connections. 
In practice, these are balanced by drawbacks. 
For instance, if the timeout value of persistent connections is larger than the TCP connection timeout, denial-of-service attacks are more effective: by using up all possible connections, a malicious user can prevent access to a targeted server for a longer period of time. 
Perhaps a quick mention of this issue would make sense in section 8.1.4 (Practical Considerations)? 
Jean-Philippe Martin-Flatin The denial of service attack is the same between persistent connections and non-persistent connections. 
I can see no difference between the two situations; the attacker does exactly the same thing in either case, with the same result. 
In general, denial of service attacks are very difficult to deal with. 
- Jim Presumably, the timeout of persistent connections will be longer than the TCP connection timeout (that is, the recommended time to maintain TCP TIME_WAIT state, generally 4 minutes). 
So even though the technique used for the attack is the same, the effect will be amplified in the case of persistent connections with long timeouts. 
Agreed.

I don't think many busy servers will likely keep that long a timeout, even with persistent connections. 
Mogul's research showed that most the value for "click ahead" occurs in the first few minutes, so a reasonable timeout for a busy server (one which will likely have to time out connections at all) is likely shorter than the TCP TIME_WAIT state. 
As I said, the attack is the same, and the effect is the same... - Jim Do you refer to: Jeffrey C. Mogul.
