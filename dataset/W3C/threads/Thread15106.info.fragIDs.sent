<s> During Sunday's Face-to-Face meeting, sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., we were discussing how the WCAG 1.0 has been implemented unmodified by certain countries into law.  </s>
<s> I believe it was Wendy who listed some counties like Canada, France, and New Zealand.  </s>
<s> Does the minute taker or anyone else taking notes, have the whole list of countries mentioned?  </s>
<s> Or Wendy, do you remember which counties you mentioned?  </s>
<s> Furthermore, does anyone know of additional governments that have adopted parts modified or un-modified of the WCAG 1.0 into law?  </s>
<s> godspeed, mark  </s>
<s> The European parliament, and the member states of the EU, have adopted WCAG as the legal standard under the eEurope program.  </s>
<s> It is not strictly true to say that the Australian government has adopted WCAG in the way that the US government has adopted section 508 as law, but I suspect that for your purposes it might be a workable simplification.  </s>
<s> That is, as I understand it, in the US it is possible to sue the gobernment if they purchase something which does not meet section 508 requirements.  </s>
<s> In australia it is possible to sue the government or a private organisation if they provide a service via the web that does not provide equal access for people with a disability.  </s>
<s> The HREOC - the body that hears such cases, recommends implementing WCAG as the way of avoiding doing that, as do all levels of Australian government, whose internal policy is to implement according to WCAG.  </s>
<s> So the effect is more or less that that is the initial legal bar against which you are measured (although Australian law basically says your accesssibility as to meet best practise standards to demonstrate a priori that you are making an effort, and if there is still an accessibilty problem after that then you need to resolve it.)

<s> Mark, A point of clarification: the Government of Canada has not taken WCAG 1.0 into law.  </s>
<s> It has made it an internal policy that federal government Web sites comply at the Double-A level with WCAG by December 2002.  </s>
<s> There is no legal requirement to do so, and there are probably few consequences (other than bad public relations) if an organization does not comply.  </s>
<s> Yet most federal Canadian organizations with which I am familiar are trying to address the issue.  </s>

<s> Mark, I did not claim that WCAG 1.0 has been implemented unmodified by all of the countries I listed.  </s>
<s> Some governments have referenced WAI guidelines generally; some have specified the documents and the version number; some have written their own version of Web accessibility guidelines or combined these with general usability or best practices guidelines.  </s>
