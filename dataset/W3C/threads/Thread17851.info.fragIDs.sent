<s> I'm sending this reply to the UAGL list.  </s>
<s> Over the past year and a half, IBM Special Needs has evaluated Home Page Reader several times against different drafts of the UA Guidelines to identify user requirements for new releases of HPR and to assess our conformance to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> We have also assessed other user agents and assistive technology against the guidelines as part of our competitve analysis.  </s>
<s> Each time we have found that the guidelines were subject to interpretation.  </s>
<s> That is, I believe, inevitable.  </s>
<s> The challenge for the Working Group is to convey a requirement that is precise enough to be understood and verifiable, but flexible enough to allow developer interpretation and alternative techniques that still allow one to satisfy the requirement.  </s>
<s> As we evaluated each guideline against the HPR product and other user agents, we asked ourselves the following questions:  </s>
<s> These and other questions might be the basis of a FAQ for the UA GL when they approach Recommendation.  </s>
<s> 1. What are some techniques and solutions that could be implemented to comply with each guideline?  </s>
<s> What are the best techniques?  </s>
<s> (We know the techniques document is attempting to address this question.)  </s>
<s> Right, and we should rank them, even if we don't use a formal system for doing so.  </s>
<s> 2. Do the techniques implemented in HPR and other user agents comply 100% with a guideline or are the implementations only sufficient or simply inadequate?  </s>
<s> Today, our only options for conformance to a checkpoint are "yes", "no", "n/a".  </s>
<s> I don't know whether we need more levels: "yes, significantly"; "yes, a little", etc.  </s>
<s> I think that we cannot eliminate all subjectivity.  </s>
<s> In the end, people should be able to say "Yes, but not very much" and still count that as a Yes.  </s>
<s> However, if there are checkpoints where you feel that conformance is easy but no accessibility issues are addressed, please let us know.  </s>
<s> 3. If HPR/other UAs do not comply with the guideline at all, is the guideline important as a user requirement for the target market?  </s>
<s> Testing, review, and experience with the guidelines will show what is important, superfluous, under-specified, and misunderstood.  </s>
<s> In part, these reviews are bringing weaknesses and unclear points to light and thus are invaluable before we go to Recommendation.  </s>
<s> 4. If you use HPR/other UAs with other mainstream browsers and assistive technology, does the total browser solution comply with the guideline?  </s>
<s> No. The goal of the current conformance statement was to allow a piece of software to conform without depending on another piece of software.  </s>
<s> Which checkpoints do you think suggest that software in tandem might conform but not individually?  </s>
<s> We are in the process of doing a conformance assessment for HPR 2.5 against the August 9, 1999, draft of the UA guidelines, and we will send that to you in a week or two.  </s>
<s> We hope that these evaluations provide some insight into how developers are and will be able to use the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> I wold have thought that whatever totoal solution you used was what covered the claim.  </s>
<s> For example "MyBrowser, and Theirbrowser, and ThisScreenReader, and ThatScreenReader, and TheOtherBrailleDevice, as a collection of tools" conform at level ....  </s>
<s> (Assuming that none of the tools comply by themselves.  </s>
<s> To take a more concrete example, I believe that Jaws for Windows will produce different compliance levels when used with different pieces of software).  </s>

<s> From the 9 August draft [1]: In order to conform as a graphical desktop browser, the user agent must satisfy all the checkpoints (for a chosen conformance level) that apply to graphical desktop browsers and do so natively.  </s>

<s> That's the only way to conform as a desktop graphical browser (according to the spec).  </s>
<s> The same applies to dependent UAs.  </s>
<s> In January we considered this (refer to Option 3 of [1]): b.ii) UAs must also satisfy the applicable Priority 1 checkpoints natively or be able to demonstrate that, in conjunction with readily available products, the checkpoints are satisfied.  </s>

<s> aloha, charles!  </s>
<s> i certainly hope haakon -- and glenn gordon -- is slash are able to help us, because, right now, no matter what i set the tool tip to display, JFW isn't echoing anything, nor is it reliably tracking the focus as it moves from link to link by the way, it took me quite some time to discover that the tool tip display menu isn't in the "Link Presentation" sub-menu of Opera's "Preferences" menu, where i expected to find it, but in the "Button and Statusbar" sub-menu, which i further learned (by going into screen review and listening to things character by character, isn't merely the button and statusbar sub-menu, but the b u t t o n dash space a n d space S t a t u s b a r sub-menu, all of which, i suppose, makes as much sense as this sentence... the upshot is that there is a status-bar type display of the link tip text on the screen, for which, i suppose i could set a JAWS monitoring frame (automatically voice when content contained within 2 predefined points changes), but to do that properly, i'd have to know how long the link title bar is, where it is, whether or not it can ever be obscured by something else on the screen, etc. -- and then, like as not, my monitoring frame would only function with anything approaching true reliability if i always ran Opera (or, rather, Opera was always spawned) in whatever window size i set the frame in, and i don't know what would happen if the TITLE was longer than the available screen-display space (i suppose i should have said "viewport"), and, well, you get the point... it'd be much simpler (in theory, at least) to get the necessary info (in this case, the TITLE of a hyperlink) from a DOM call, but how i myself would get that voiced from within Opera using JFW, i know not... anyway, no matter how i set Opera to display tool tips for links, they aren't being voiced by either JFW or Window-Eyes, which, i, admittedly, am running without a customized set file for Opera... HAL, on the other hand, simply reads the hyperlink text, regardless of the tool tip setting, so it is with HAL that i usually use Opera -- which isn't bad if the point of the exercise is to keep up one's proficiency at using multiple screen readers... gregory.  </s>

<s> a quick update on JFW failing to vocalize hyperlink text when using Opera -- acting upon a suggestion offered off-list by Dave Poehlman, I activated the "Invert Marked Text" option in the "Document Appearance" property sheet, and JFW now speaks the hyperlink text whenever a hyperlink receives focus... the larger issue, however, of getting JFW, when voicing content as rendered by Opera, to recognize the TITLE attribute where it is defined for a hyperlink, still remains unresolved, for the reasons enumerated in my post of 31 August, which is archived at (long URI warning!) gregory.  </s>

<s> aloha, again, charles!  </s>
<s> a further update on Opera -- as i noted in my compliance eval of the UAGL with HAL95, in the comments following checkpoint 1.1 [reference 1], Opera has difficulty identifying hyperlink text in ordered and unordered lists if any markup is used in the hyperlink text, in particular, ACRONYM, ABBR, or EM... this afternoon, i noticed a further anomaly -- when tabbing sequentially through links, i traversed a link whose hyperlink text i happen to know includes a word contained in em /em -- moving forward through the links, the entire hyperlink text was voiced, but when i backtracked and moved through the links in reverse sequential order, only the word contained within the EM container was voiced... when i noticed this behavior, i was using JFW 3.3.26  </s>
<s> -- i unloaded JFW and loaded HAL, and then tried navigating the ordered list again... things worked out similarly -- when i reached the link in which the EM container was used by navigating forward link-by-link, the entire hyperlink text was spoken, but when i moved back link-by-link, only the word contained in the EM container was spoken... a further anomaly is encountered when the first word in the hyperlink text is marked up -- such as:in the following example from http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/books/index.html in which underscores are used to indicate EM on and EM off: _Rebecca and Rowena_, a complete work by W.M .Thackeray when the link is selected by reverse sequential navigation of links, HAL repeated the hyperlink text from the previous link (i.e. the link which had just lost focus) in the following manner: "deselect [hyperlink text of previous link]" switching back to JFW, when traversing the page link-by-link in reverse order, using the "Q" keystroke, when i reached the link to the Thackeray book, JFW echoed absolutely nothing... and, upon screen-review of the hyperlink text, the entire line is spoken.. gregory.  </s>
