Hi Joseph, The following is our(NEC's) interop results for Canonical XML, Exclusive Canonical XML, and, XPath Filter. 
Could you update the interop matrixes? 
Thanks in advance, Takuya Mori Takuya Mori moritaku@bx.jp.nec.com / tk-mori@isd.nec.co.jp Internet Solution Platform Development Div., NEC Solutions, Tokyo Japan ======== Canonical XML ======== [Features]NEC Octet stream input:Y1 withComments:Y1 Document Subsets (c14n portion of a document):Y1 Node-set input (achieve subsetting via Xpath like node-set input):Y1 [Processor Requrements] Use processors that support UTF-8 and UTF-16 and that translate to the UCS character domain:Y1 implementations report an operation failure on documents containing relative namespace URIs.:Y1 implementations NOT be implemented with an XML parser that converts relative URIs to absolute URIs.:Y1 [Examples] "PIs, Comments, and Outside of Document Element":Y1 Whitespace in Document Content:Y1 Start and End Tags:Y1 Character Modifications and Character References:Y1 Entity References:Y1 UTF-8 Encoding:Y1 Document SubsetsY1 ======== Exclusive Canonical XML ======== [Features]NEC Not rendering out-of-subset ancestor xml:* attributes.:Y1 
Y2 Y3 Y4 The first occurence of a namespace node occurs on elements nodes where it is actually utilzied.:Y1 
Y2 Y3 Y4 InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList specified prefixes are treated according to Canonical XML.:Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 The ""#default"" token in the PrefixList designates the default namespace declaration (non-prefixed) should be treated according to Canonical XML.:Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Performance: does it equal or exceed performance of Canonical XML on a similar operation?:Y 
======== XPath Filter ======== [Application Features]NEC xpath-filter2Y1 performance: signature generation and verification over sign-xsfl.xml: 
in ~500ms on ~700 bogomips machine.:Y 
======== the end of our interop results ======== I'm always happy to document inerop smile/ In that case... Attached our the Datapower XS-40 interop statements for c14n and exc-c14n. 
Thanks!
