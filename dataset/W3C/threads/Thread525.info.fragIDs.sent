<s> Dear Folks, [From an EMail from Mike Lam] Be aware that I'm having mail troubles with one of my EMail accounts at the moment.  </s>
<s> I am copying the lists directly [a little bit of background - some changes to Tidy were proposed recently, to add more accessibility checking - Mike is currently cleaning up the code and error msgs, after various private discussions between him, myself and Chris Ridpath].  </s>
<s> I'm currently updating the error/warning messages, so that they are more clear.  </s>
<s> They appear to be very vague in some cases, and I'm working to improve on that.  </s>
<s> With regards to the summaries, we think that it would be best if we incorporated these summaries for each error/warning into a separate html file, that could be included in the tidy package.  </s>
<s> This way, the user can simply review the errors/warnings , and then use the html document as an index for error correction.  </s>
<s> And this would also make the output of tidy shorter, cleaner, and more simplified for the user.  </s>
<s> What is your opinion with regards to these issues?  </s>
<s> Could you send an email to the tidy list, and see what everyone else's opinion is as well?  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I would agree with the principle of keeping the output (and code size) of Tidy shorter (smaller).  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the existing (non-accessibility checking) Tidy summary works reasonably well, and can't be lost like a separate HTML file.  </s>
<s> I had another idea, not specific to accessibility checking, even before you wrote this EMail, that might make even more sense to look at now.  </s>
<s> But definitely something that needs the opinions of others on the list.  </s>
<s> Specifically, either by default, or through an option (which I think I would prefer), the error output (stderr) produced by Tidy, would be created as (X)HTML rather than plain ASCII text.  </s>
<s> I might even go so far as to say that this error output may not even have to be complete/valid HTML.  </s>
<s> What I am really looking for is outputting URLs (pointing to error summaries, tips etc) as HTML links.  </s>
<s> e.g. (I don't know how this will look like in your mail client) line 63 column 26 - A HREF="access_errors.html#59" Warning [59]: img missing descriptive text (longdesc/dlink).  </s>
<s> /A Then in any web browser etc, clicking on the link will take you to the appropriate summary (in the local file "access_errors.html")  </s>
<s> : [59] : Priority 1 All images require text equivalents, but 'alt' text must also meet certain criteria, otherwise it may be considered suspicious.  </s>
<s> For example, 'alt' text may be considered unacceptable if image filenames and/or image file extensions (i.e. alt='xmas_tree.gif')  </s>
<s> are used instead of an actual text equivalent.  </s>
<s> Everyone's thoughts on the matter?  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> Your proposal to provide the error output as HTML with links would be very user friendly and, imho, greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> I also think that this should be an option, since it would increase the output size and structure.  </s>
<s> I like the general idea of emitting links (of some kind) to a reference document.  </s>
<s> Certainly, XHTML makes sense for this purpose.  </s>
<s> Agree that this would be generally applicable and not just for accessibility messages.  </s>
<s> This approach might also lays the groundwork for fine-grained filtering of errors, warnings, etc.  </s>
<s> I think it is simply too large a change to entertain prior to release.  </s>
<s> I'd still like to get a stable, production release out for 3rd party tools and bundlers to sync up with.  </s>
<s> Not to mention Dave's web page forwarding folks to SourceForge.  </s>
<s> Etc., etc.  </s>
<s> It is really a logistical issue, not a technical or design issue.  </s>
<s> FYI, I have been buried at work.  </s>
<s> I am taking two weeks off at the end of December, however.  </s>
<s> So I anticipate a few days of Tidy doc work and bug fixing.  </s>
