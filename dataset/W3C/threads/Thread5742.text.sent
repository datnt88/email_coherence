I have a question about the OWL test suite. 
In Restriction test 5 (http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/Restriction/Manifest005#test), there is a negative entailment test for the introduction of a concept name in the conclusions (it's labelled as a "mis-application of the OWL comprehension axioms"). 
This test fails if the reasoner allows the introduction of concept in the conclusions. 
Conversely, in Description Logic test 901 (http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/description-logic/Manifest901#test), the positive conclusions are of the form: owl:minCardinality rdf:datatype= "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonNegativeInteger" 2 /owl:minCardinality This seems to require me to use the comprehension axioms to introduce a new concept (albeit an anonymous one), in a way that restriction test 5 says shouldn't be done. 
I'm wondering why this wasn't done as a consistency test, and whether there is indeed a conflict between the two tests. 
Thanks, Ian I've done some research on the internet, without any results. 
Could anybody tell me what exactly are the OWL comprehension rules? 
And why do they impede the introduction of a concept in the conclusions? 
(If I missed something important in the standard documents, please accept my apology).

Subject: Re: Question on OWL tests Date: Wed, 19 May 2004 13:36:52 +0200 I quick search in OWL S&amp;AS for ``comprehension'' provides a table of the Comprehension conditions (principles) in OWL. 
They are needed, for example, so that ex:a rdf:type ex:b . 
ex:a rdf:type ex:c . 
OWL-entails ex:a rdf:type _:d . 
_:d owl:intersectionOf _:l1 . 
_:l1 rdf:first ex:b . 
_:l1 rdf:rest _:l2 . 
_:l2 rdf:first ex:c . 
_:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil . 
Without the first comprehension principle this entailment would not hold because ex:a rdf:type ex:b . 
ex:a rdf:type ex:c . 
would not OWL-entail _:l1 rdf:first ex:b . 
_:l1 rdf:rest _:l2 . 
_:l2 rdf:first ex:c . 
_:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil . 
i.e., there would not need to be a list containing ex:a and ex:b so there would be no way to form its intersection. 
Yes, this is all an artifact of having to encode OWL syntax in semantically-meaningful RDF triples.
