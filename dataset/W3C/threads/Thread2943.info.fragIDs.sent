<s> Hi there, RFC 2616, Section 13.2.4 "Expiration Calculations" contains the following MUST: The cache MUST attach Warning 113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning has not already been added.  </s>
<s> The context of that MUST is expiration calculation and, hence, cache hits.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, attaching a Warning to misses may help in case there is a non-1.1-compliant  </s>

<s> Did the author(s) intend for the above MUST to apply to HIT responses only?  </s>

<s> Did the author(s) intend for the above MUST to apply to HIT responses only?  </s>
<s> Again, I believe I wrote this part.  </s>
<s> Take a look at section 14.46 (Warning) which defines the specific warning-value mentioned above: 113 Heuristic expiration MUST be included if the cache heuristically chose a freshness lifetime greater than 24 hours and the response's age is greater than 24 hours.  </s>
<s> True, it's not explicit here that this applies only to cache hits.  </s>
<s> But it would only be interesting on a miss if the cache's heuristic choice for a freshness lifetime were to be inserted into the forwarded response header.  </s>
<s> In other words, the origin server sent no Expires header (or something equivalent, such as a max-age directive) and the proxy guessed at one and then added an Expires header to the response.  </s>
<s> But look at section 13.5.2  </s>
<s> (Non-modifiable Headers), which says that A transparent proxy MUST NOT modify [the Expires field in a response, but MAY add one] if not already present.  </s>
<s> If an Expires header is added, it MUST be given a field-value identical to that of the Date header in that response.  </s>
<s> so (by that MUST) the cache isn't allowed to propagate its heuristically-chosen freshness lifetime to anyone else.  </s>
<s> Since section 13.5.2  </s>
<s> doesn't discuss Cache-Control, this looks like a loophole in the spec (e.g., the cache could perhaps add "Cache-control: max-age=1000000000") but I would hope that proxy cache implementors aren't actively looking for loopholes of this sort.  </s>
<s> Probably, therefore, you should read the relevant part of 14.46 as if it said: 113 Heuristic expiration MUST be included if the cache heuristically chose a freshness lifetime greater than 24 hours for a cache entry, the response is taken from that cache entry, and the age of the response is greater than 24 hours.  </s>
<s> I can't see any reason to Warn anyone on a miss that creates a new cache entry with a heuristic expiration lifetime, given  </s>
<s> that the cache shouldn't be propagating these heuristic values towards the client.  </s>

<s> Jeff, Thanks for a clarification!  </s>
<s> It looks like the answer depends on whether "it is interesting" to add this Warning to a miss.  </s>
<s> That is, whether there is any "use" in attaching such a Warning.  </s>
<s> You think it is not useful because cache heuristics do not apply to misses.  </s>
<s> I think one could consider it being useful because the Warning could be about upstream cache's heuristic, not about the cache adding a Warning.  </s>
<s> See below.  </s>
<s> The only reason I can think of is the "garbage in, compliance out" principle: the proxy should improve the "quality" of responses it forwards.  </s>
<s> Imagine that there is a non-HTTP/1.1 cache upstream that cached the response for more than 24 hours.  </s>
<s> Imagine that the requesting client agent supports Warnings but does not analyze response age.  </s>
<s> If a compliant proxy adds a Warning (that the upstream cache should have added, but did not!), the user will get a useful Warning.  </s>
<s> The above scenario is quite artificial, of course.  </s>
<s> I am not sure whether it is good enough to say that the MUST in question should apply to misses.  </s>

<s> My answer was intended to convey what the *current* specification requires and why, not whether it might be a good idea to expand the specification.  </s>
<s> Also, note that the terms "upstream" and "downstream", as defined in RFC2616, probably mean something different than how you are using them.  </s>
<s> I think by "upstream" you mean "inbound" (i.e., closer to the origin server).  </s>

<s> Remember that RFC2119, "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels", says Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly.  </s>
<s> In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions) For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not required for interoperability.  </s>
<s> You're right that the scenario seems like a weak reason to add another MUST or SHOULD to the spec.  </s>
<s> I'd be inclined to fix this problem by asking why a client that is capable of dealing with Warnings is not "analyzing the response age" (which seems like a basic requirement of the spec.) -Jeff  </s>
<s> In case the method in a URL is a POST method, then is that the query parameters are ignored.  </s>

<s> Will this result in the the query parameters "hl=en&amp;ie=UTF" to be ignored as per HTTP standards ?? Thanks Diwakar  </s>
