Is there anything else that needs to be done to your standard SGML declaration for a Basic document other than DELIM GENERAL SGMLREF PIC "? " and NAMECASE GENERAL NO 
Huh? I think we finally decided to case-fold, so you mean YES. 
But somebody who really knows this stuff does need to synthesize an SGML declaration for XML. - Tim

I'm quite glad, then, since case sensitivity was problematic for me. 
Sorry, I must have missed that decision. 
In that case, we can just go with NAMECASE as in the SGML decl for Basic SGML docs. 
Of course, 8879:1986 doesn't break down all the options/features in such a way that one could give a precise (necessary and sufficient) 8879:1986 SGML decl for XML, but it would be useful to publish the sufficient and closest-to-necessary-as-possible-given-8879:1986 SGML declaration for XML. 
You didn't miss it. 
It took me a couple of days to catch up with the reporting.
