<s> Today I've been skimming over the new book by Molly Holzschlag, "Special Edition Using XHTML", and it looks great to me.  </s>
<s> But, I am biased.  </s>
<s> I contributed two chapters to this book and I tech edited most of it, so I feel a sense of, hm, not quite "parental pride", maybe "proud uncle".  </s>
<s> Besides the fact that I think Molly is a good, clear writer who produces very readable and enjoyable books on web design, I am also pleased with the pervasive emphasis on accessibility and sound principles of web design found throughout this book.  </s>
<s> Usually I cringe when reading web authoring books, but I think this promotes a very sane viewpoint which is compatible with WAI philosophy.  </s>
<s> (And, hopefully I caught any accidental accessibility omissions in the tech editing process, although it's possible one or two might have slipped through.  </s>
<s> If you find any missing alt text in the examples, yell at me.) Of the two chapters which I wrote, I'm happiest with the one on XSLT, which provides an introduction to how you can do practical transformations of XHTML.  </s>
<s> Obviously, it's limited by the scope of the book; the examples are rather trite, but I think they're enough to get web designers thinking about the possibility of using XSLT to effect structural changes.  </s>
<s> And the nice picture of Edapta's dear departed web page was nice to see in print.  </s>
<s> I've set up a forwarding link to the book's entry on Amazon.com: Full disclosure: That reference uses my wife's Amazon.com affiliate id, so she may make a few cents if you buy the book that way.  </s>
