<s> Can anyone confirm whether the browse button works on loads or saves in amaya on a Win98 platform... it has not worked for me in several versions of amaya but have not had feedback from amaya team or others whether browse works.... on my machine first click on browse button does nil .... second click throws me out of amaya completely .... --  </s>

<s> So another reporter is not having an issue with browse on Win98! hmmm from this i assume one of two things .... 1] something is messed up in my ini files 2] amaya uses some windows component (one that i am missing) that other programs do not... all my other applications including browsers, editors, file viewers, comparison utilities etc work aok it is only the Amaya gui ones that don't.  </s>
<s> The html input type=file is a separate issue.  </s>
<s> To help resolve which of these situations it is I used control panel to remove amaya, deleted my shortcut icon, deleted the Amaya folder from Program Files (to remove ini stuff) and searched registry for any amaya pointers or hooks.... and removed.  </s>
<s> So my drive is as clean as possible.  </s>
<s> reinstalled amaya but same problem first call to browse gives lots of hard drive activity but nothing on screen.  </s>
<s> second call pops me out of amaya abruptly with no signoff messages.  </s>
<s> can someone on the team tell me if the browser api call is done in a different manner in amaya than it is in all other software... in other words is it being done in the microsoft defined way... what component may i be missing that only fouls amaya but noone else ??? this is a major problem as i cant wonder thru my directories at will !!
