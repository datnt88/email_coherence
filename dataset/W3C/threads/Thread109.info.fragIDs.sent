If I put A href="http://www.ukerna.ac.uk" onmouseover= "change('ukerna', 1);" onmouseout="change('ukerna', 0);" through tidy26jun99 the single quotes around the word ukerna are removed. 
If "quote-marks: yes" is in the config file I end up with !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN A href="http://www.ukerna.ac.uk" onmouseover= "change(&amp;#39;ukerna&amp;#39;, 1);" onmouseout= "change(&amp;#39;ukerna&amp;#39;, 0);" (accepted by my browser but not valid HTML) 
Previous versions of tidy did not do this. 
Any suggestions ? 
TTFN, Philip Riebold 
Actually it is fine (ie perfectly legal) to include entities within attribute values. 
Browsers expand the entities before processing the attribute value.

Hi Philip, I have fixed the problem and will post a new release asap. 
Thanks for reporting it. 
p.s. Philip noted that single quote marks were being silently dropped in attribute values unless you set quote-marks to yes.
