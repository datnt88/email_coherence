John Slatin proposed the following rewording of example 2 for checkpoint 1.1 [1] Providing a short label and a longer explanation are provided for a data chart. 
A bar chart compares how many widgets were sold in June, July, and August. 
The short label says, "Graph of the numbers of widgets sold in June, July, and August." 
The longer description identifies the type of chart or graph, provides a high-level summary of the data comparable to that available from the chart or graph, and lists the data themselves. 
I suggest that we accept this proposal in the next draft.

If, in the text, it already says something like "figure one shows that from june to august sales fell from one to zero" then I would suggesty that an appropriate alternative is "figure one - sales in june, july an august".

I agree: ALT text and onscreen text should complement each other, not merely duplicate.
