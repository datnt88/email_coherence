Well, it's time to start the IANA registration process for text/xml. 
The first step is to send a message to the discussion group that reviews proposals for new media types. 
My previous experience with the registration of media types is zero, so I need the knowledgeable members of the WG to help out here. 
According to draft-ietf-822ext-mime-reg-03, rfc1590, and rfc1521, the message that begins the discussion should look something like the one I've appended below. 
Please review and comment if you are familiar with this process. 
Jon Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/xml MIME media type name: text MIME subtype name: xml Required parameters: none Optional parameters: charset Encoding considerations: the primary encodings are UTF-8 and UCS-2, but other common encoding schemes such as SJIS are also allowed. 
UTF-8 is the default. 
Security considerations: the security considerations associated with text/plain apply. 
Interoperability considerations: the interoperability considerations associated with text/plain apply.

This might go better if there was a magic number -- i.e. if there was a way of determining that a file was an XML file by inspecting the first few bytes. 
?-XML- 
might be such a magic number. 
(I assume that ?XML was an error, since PI targets are supposed to be notations, but we don't want to invade the user's name space for notations, so it would have to be -XML- instead) Lee I'm glad you're thinking of this, Jon, but isn't it premature to register the MIME type before the spec is finished? 
If a MIME type is needed for demos, let's use text/x-xml until both linking and style sheets are settled. 
It would be reasonable for the recipients of the request to ask "what about security considerations for linking and style sheets?", to which we perforce have no answer yet.

(Q: what MIME content-type is generally associated with computer program sources?) /kmc [Keith Corbett:] I think that the conventional choice would be text/x-xml. 
That's what people will be expecting and that's what we should use until text/xml is registered. 
Jon I think that application/xml is necessary, too. 
All text/* types, I believe, are required to have normalized line endings (0x0d0a). 
This works for 8-bit encodings, but for 16-bit encodings, 0x000d000a becomes 0x000d0a000d0a, which isn't quite the same thing... -Chris !ENTITY crism PUBLIC "-//EBT//NONSGML Christopher R. Maden//EN" SYSTEM This sounds like a conflict with the MIME specification and Unicode that needs to be resolved, rather than hacking a (albeit, working) solution. 
XML documents are by nature 'text', so possibly this is something that has been already brought up in MIME discussions. 
Anyone? 
I was going to ask Glenn Adams, but he *just* left for the night. 
I have to agree with Jon that text/x-xml seems logical (ie., the choice that people would guess).

RFC 1874 on SGML Media Types defines both text and application for SGML, with some language that may or may not be relevant; the main idea appears to be to provide fallback to text/plain from text/sgml.

Got it -- thanks Terry. 
The fact that the RFC states preference for US-ASCII was kinda my point. 
Since the default charset for XML is not US-ASCII, I don't think the assumption in RFC 1874 is valid or useful in XML. 
And yes, I think the RFC should be changed, not XML. 
From the XML 1.0 spec: This specification depends on the international standard ISO/IEC 10646 and the technically identical Unicode Standard, Version 2.0, which define the encodings and meanings of the characters which make up XML text data. 
Relevant quotes from RFC 1874 follow. 
Section 2.1 describes text/sgml as being employed when software is meant to be human-readable: 2.1. 
Text/SGML MIME type name: Text MIME subtype name: SGML Required parameters: none Optional parameters: charset, SGML-bctf, SGML-boot Encoding considerations: may be encoded Security considerations: see section 4 below Published specification: ISO 8879:1986 Person and email address to contact for further information: E. Levinson ELevinson@Accurate.com 
The Text/SGML media-type can be employed when the contents of the SGML entity is intended to be read by a human and is in a readily comprehensible form. 
That is the content can be easily discerned by someone without SGML display software. 
Each record in the SGML entity, delimited by record start (RS) and record end (RE) codes, must correspond to a line in the Text/SGML body part. 
SGML entities that do not meet the above requirements should use the Application/SGML media-type. 
A document in UCS-4 Arabic is certainly intended to be read by a human. 
The problem doesn't seem to be use of RS and RE per se, it's their transformation into multibyte Unicode equivalents. 
[...describing the 'charset' parameter...] charset The charset parameter for Text/SGML is defined in [RFC-1521], the valid values and their meaning are registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [RFC-1590]. 
The default charset value for all Text content-types is "us-ascii" [RFC-1521]. 
The charset parameter is provided to permit non- SGML capable systems to provide reasonable behavior when Text/SGML defaults to Text/Plain. 
SGML capable systems will use the SGML-bctf param- eter. 
What needs changing is the definition of MIME 'text/*' from 646 to 10646, not a UCS-4 document instance into an 'application/*' MIME type. 
Otherwise, MIME is inextricably bound to US-ASCII, which seems a mistake. 
I'm sure someone more qualified than I has argued this out in the MIME/SGML WGs. 
XML may simply be among the first applications requiring this type of i18n modification to what are gradually becoming outdated specs.

This has been discussed to death by myself, and others. 
The MIME folk are ware of the problem, but there seems to be no resolution pending that I am aware of. 
Note that MIME has to be backwards compatible with RFC822 by default, and with existing mail and netnews gateways -- it isn't only used for HTTP, of course... Other applications get round this by using a MIME Charset: header, I think. 
But I'm not sure how to get an existing or nearly-existing httpd server to add Charset lines wiothout hacking it, unless you put the MIME headers in the file and use .asis 
processing (where supported). 
Lee Many current servers allow you to add the charset label on the HTTP Content-Type field. 
Apache and Netscape certainly do.
