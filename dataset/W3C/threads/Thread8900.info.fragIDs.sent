<s> Hi Donald, C14N doesn't remove new lines inside content.  </s>
<s> However, line delimiters are normalized to #xA characters, so if one is going to move a document around in canonical form, then one would have to convert each #xA to #xD#xA before calling an RFC2045-compliant base 64 decoder.  </s>
<s> Seems like a royal pain considering the fact that virtually everybody writes decoders that don't require the linefeeds at all and simply skip CR and LF characters (regardless of whether they are in sequence).  </s>
<s> I think that as long as we were clear that an XML-DSig compliant base 64 transform must be permissive w.r.t. the placement and context of occurrence of CR and LF characters, then it should be fine.  </s>
