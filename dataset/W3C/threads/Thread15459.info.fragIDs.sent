I wanted to throw into the discussion a quick implementation example of the invisible D link graphic contrasted with a visible graphic and the current text D. Gregg and I discussed this a little off line, and I wanted to open the example up for comments. 
We have the requirement in the Digital Talking Book work to provide image descriptions, which are implemented as in-line text after the image. 
In looking toward DTBs that serve a range of users such as LD and Dyslexic, the in-line text description becomes less practical. 
In looking at the D link text tag, it came across non-intuitive both visually and aurally. 
When the topic of the invisible D graphic came up, I decided to mock it up using actual samples from one of our books. 
After some interesting reactions to the invisible graphic from sighted users, I added the third option of a stylized, small D link graphic along the lines of what you find on the CNN site for links to zoomed images or videos. 
For your review, visit http://www.prodworks.com/books/d-example.html and try it with the browser of your choice under various conditions (graphics loading on and off, with speech, without).

Like it! 
Personal preference is for the visible D link. 
Use: Netscape. 
Simple curiosity says 'follow the link' then having done it once, as a sighted reader, I can ignore the rest. 
Would like to hear reaction from someone using text to speech browser, or Lynx.

I like the trick of invisible D link using null.gif and border=0 (not even the link marker is visible). 
I also like the look of the visible D graphics. 
But it brings up the following question: - is the long description only useful if the image is not accessible or does it complete/add to the image value ? 
I looked back at Gregg classification (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-wg/1997JulSep/0082.html) but couldn't find a clear position on that. 
If the description adds to the image value, and is to be used with the image, there should be no reason for the author to hide its link, and the visible D graphics is my preferred method. 
It's not an accessibility issue anymore in fact, since the image is accessible. 
It's the metadata kind, where the image is the data and the longdesc is more data about the data (origin, context, etc) If the description is to be used as a replacement of the image (it completes ALT), then I still question the "invisibility" of the link in the case where several images are laid out together to form some kind of mosaic or other tight formatting wanted by the author: will the presence of any kind of valid markup that is not an attribute (like the proposed LONGDESC), like anchors (even null.gif border=0) modify the page layout in any way ? 
I'll try a test page soon. 
If the description is to be used as a replacement of the image (it completes ALT), then I still question the "invisibility" of the link in the case where several images are laid out together to form some kind of mosaic or other tight formatting wanted by the author: Smaller issue: Is it really 'invisible'. 
When the mouse rides over it the cursor changes to the hand, indicating (on Netscape) that a link is there. 
Curiosity then takes over. 
Only invisible if you don't suffer from wandering mouse syndrome.
