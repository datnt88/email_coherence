There are a number of things on the issues list, and some of them seem ripe for resolution. 
I propose we resolve: That the guidelines need to address standards other than HTML. 
In particular, we should cover XML in general, and W3C recommendations which are XML subsets in particular - SMIL, MathML are recommendations, and there are others which are being ddrawn up, such as Scalable Vector Graphics. 
The principles of seperating content and presentation, providing alternative content where media-dependence cannot be avoided, and assisting orientation in the documents produced by a tool, (which I have proposed be listed explicitly in section 2, as introductory material rather than as checkpoints, and the guidelines and checkpoints provided in sections 3 and 4 of the current document, seem sufficient to me in terms of guidelines. 
There may be some particular techniques to be applied, although I suspect that in general they are the same as those used for HTML.

I suggest the following: Checkpoint x.1 The use of markup which does not conform to W3C standards must not interfere with the user being able to access the form or function of a document. 
checkpoint x.2 Non-standard markup should not be used where it is possible t make use of a W3C recommendation. 
In the absence of a recommendation, or in the absence of widespread implementations, non-standard markup may enhance the use of a page by certain groups. 
In such situations, alternatives must be generated (see the first statement techniques: An example is the use of a form which includes scripted validation after each entry to optimise the form for server-side processing. 
Where the script may not be executed, there must be some alternative, such as a server-side validation, or tolerant processing of errors. 
Another example is the use of an applet to generate a series of links which replace each other. 
This could either be done by providing the same links as alternative content to the applet object, or by using SMIL to allow the production of an accessible version, or by providing a text-only version.

The numbe of XML related standards coming out is ... big. 
Key one for XML. 
Give us the DTD with the document. 
I only know of one tool that gens the DTD from the document, and its not open source.

I'm not sure if I understand. 
Is this something like declaring a namespace, or a DOCTYPE declaration in HTML, or otherwise giving a reference to the syntax, or is there a seperate issue? 
Certainly in the use of various XML beasties this is important, and I suspect rates a checkpoint or even a guideline. 
Would you care to elaborate for us?
