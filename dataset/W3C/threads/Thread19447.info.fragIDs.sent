A few days after installation amaya decided to ignore my double-clicks altogether i.e. it simply does not follow hyperlinks anymore. 
Does someone have the same problem and better yet the solution? 
Thanks. 
BTW does anyone know of a 100% (or so) error free fully HTML (any W3C spec.) compliant browser? 
Of the browsers installed around here: 
- KFM (KDE File Manager, HTML widget) - Netscape 4 - Amaya no one is. 
Frankly I am starting to loose faith in the prospect of a quality, seriously interoperable, WWW! How dificult can it be to write a decent browser, at least for Linux? 
I am convinced that Amaya could be this (a 100% error free HTML 4 compliant browser) _if and only if_ the Amaya team would focus on the browser itself. 
A WYSIWYG HTML editor simply does not make any sense! 
HTML is a _language_! 
I bet 99.999999% of HTML authors prefer to write HTML by hand. 
(I also suspect that many Amaya bugs are actualy in---or caused by---the Thot system. 
If this is true, and then since (as I understand) Thot development has stopped, then if Amaya would focus on browsing it would be less costly to migrate to a more stable system.) 
It is very clear to me that the requisites of a quality WWW in the near future include the existence of browsers fully compliant with HTML 4, CSS2, XML (in that order). 
(I am aware there some questions here should be taken to the general W3 forum and so they will in due course.)

Could you analyze what has changed when amaya decided to ignore double-clicks? 
It should be a great help to understand what is the problem. 
I don't agree with you Mario. 
80% of HTML authors use authoring tools (like FrontPage, Home Page, Page Mill, Netscape-Composer, etc.). 
HLML 4, MathML and then XML are not so easy to write by hand! 
True, but that needs a lot of work in current browsers.

You know, I'm not in love with the amaya team. 
They don't answer 
my questions, ignore or flame my remarks, and produce more bugs than line of codes (well, that last one is not true! 
- put as many smiley here as you wish:). 
In fact I'm even ashamed some of them are from the well renown french INRIA. 
:( 
Anyway, amaya is more a tool to test the standard than a declared browser or even wysiwyg editor. 
As such, bugs should be forgiven. 
I would defend them against unjustified attacks. 
And this one is not justified at all. 
More : please be sure that the easyer the tool, the happier the user. 
Web creators don't need to be programmers. 
They shall be graphists, artists, publicists, journalists, whatever, but the ruling of our race (programmers) on the web is to be done. 
Thus a WYSIWIG html generator is needed, asked for and used when available. 
Even programmers like I am (those who focus on the result and not on the way) use perl and emacs only because they have no better editor handy to generate good and errorfree HTML. 
I support the amaya team to develop and give as a free tool something that otherwise is unheard of.

Hello, We may forget to answer some questions but we take into account all remarks, suggestions and bug reports sent to the mailing list. 
You say that you are ashamed that some of us are from INRIA. 
Let me tell you that we are only two people (both from INRIA) fully involved in the project. 
We have to correct bugs, develop new features and W3C recommandations, and answer questions. 
Do you think that this is an easy task.
