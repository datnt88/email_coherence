Hi, Has OWL development stopped? 
It looks like it... What about RuleML and next levels? 
Are there any official statemnts roadmaps, etc.? Buggy Hi Buggy, It's not that OWL development has stopped, but rather: we moved from developing OWL to developing _with_ OWL ;-) If you're interested in RuleML, have a look at SWRL: -Rinke Rinke Hoekstra hoekstra@lri.jur.uva.nl

It looks like it... What about RuleML and next levels? 
Are there any official statemnts roadmaps, etc.? Buggy THe development of a W3C Recommendation for the OWL langauge has stopped - the group accomplished its mission - OWL became a recommendation in February (See http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL) as a result, the Working Group has achieved what it was chartered to do, and by W3C process it will end its work completely in the near future. 
That said, work in OWL and the Semantic Web certainly continues! 
The W3C now hosts a semantic web interest group and two new working groups - one to look at distributed access to RDF stores and one to develop semantic web best practices -- information about these can be found at the W3C Semantic Web page -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw and ruleML continues, just not as a W3C effort - they and other rule efforts can be found via a web search. 
So the work continues, just not here... -Jim Hendler Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler
