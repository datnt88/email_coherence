<s> Apropos the subject line, what's a "4.3"?  </s>
<s> A terrible idea.  </s>
<s> Some ancient HTML techniques, like a rel or a type , are virtually unsupported.  </s>
<s> And now we're going to limit what future technologies people can use?  </s>
<s> Why not just de-invent the Web?  </s>
<s> In any event, for W3C technologies, we elsewhere require valid code.  </s>
<s> If  </s>

<s> Or, more relevantly to this esteemed Working Group's history, it is not relevant that the heavily-favoured Jaws program does not support it.  </s>

<s> There is a tension here that has resisted simple attempts to resolve it.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> will begin with an example of the problem, and follow with some thoughts on what a solution might look like (since I don't have a clear and polished answer).  </s>
<s> SVG, a moderately new technology (the first implementations are only about 5  </s>
<s> years old, and the finished recommendation is only a couple of years old), has been described by one accessibility expert as "vapourware" - i.e. not suitable for making content available.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it has the ability to encode beautiful graphics, nice fonts with cool artistic effects, or what I would think of as hideously unclear pictures which obfuscate the idea they convey in a swirling miasma of animation effects and groovy filters, in a way that allows for conformant user agents to provide the clear accessible version of the information that the author included.  </s>
<s> (The SVG specification has formal accessibility requirements in its conformance section, and there is information around on ways to make it happen).  </s>
<s> Should authors avoid SVG?  </s>
<s> Should we "de-invent" it, and stick with the old raster formats that don't provide these accessibility features?  </s>
<s> Should we require people to work with the real-world mess of broken browsers?  </s>
<s> South America has a lot of people using email-based browsers, or windows 95 or 98 with a version of Internet Explorer 5, or Netscape 4? Or should we say "while there are only 7 people in the world with a working implementation of the format exampleML, it is very much better for accessibility than what is commonly used, so feel free to use it and claim your content is accessible"?  </s>
<s> It seems to me valuable to work with things that are available.  </s>
<s> People?developing for a new technology may not be creating content that is generally accessible, but content that will be more accesible in the (near?) future.  </s>
<s> People who ignore new features that are developed, and which don't have any ill effect when not supported, are in my opinion slowing the development of accessibility.  </s>
<s> The difficulty is finding a reasonable definition of when it is reasonable to use a new technology that is not backwards compatible.  </s>
<s> Or saying it another way, how much implementation in browsers, and how much do those browsers need to be used in the real world, is required for something to be useful?  </s>
<s> I don't think that "specified in a W3C recommendation" is sufficient to meet the requirements.  </s>
<s> Nor does it make sense to me that "works in Netscape 3" is a requirement.  </s>
<s> So I think a working approach would specify how to decide what level of implementation is necessary.  </s>
<s> Perhaps none - if the working group decides it doesn't matter whether tools are available to actual humans.  </s>
<s> Examples that have been proposed include whether something is available for two languages,  </s>
<s> or two operating systems, or for free, etc.  </s>
<s> Similarly, it should describe  </s>
<s> some way of determining what technology does not need to be supported (assuming the working group believes there is some technology in this category).  </s>
<s> So Joe is right that it is important to encourage development of newer and better technology, but I think it is not necessarily a good idea to assume that something is accessible just because it could be if people had the right software.  </s>
<s> I suspect finding a reasonable balance is going to be difficult - and "ask an expert" is probably not sufficiently specified to put in the guidelines... cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> [etc]  </s>
<s> Chaals, as usual on the button, but would add that it's not sufficient now to create accessible new technology and pages.  </s>
<s> What is significant is the need for simple and good authoring tools.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately there still isn't a great html authoring tool, smirk kind of looks promising.  </s>
<s> jsketch is great for SVG.  </s>
<s> But, and many of you may not credit this, but publishing is still a very complex issue.  </s>
<s> Teaching staff at our college after 2 years working on peepo, have not really come to terms with the reality of the separation of these two activities.  </s>
<s> Indeed that college doesn't have the skill set to manage there own site and farms this out.  </s>
<s> creating a navigeable site is just not trivial.  </s>
<s> SVG does nothing to improve this issue, which is a fundamental barrier to public access.  </s>
<s> Accessibility has to mean good tools for publishing complex sites, and it doesn't yet.  </s>
<s> We haven't developed the lexicon that describes what a site is, and so it's still a dream.  </s>
