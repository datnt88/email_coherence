Hello, I have recently upgraded to Amaya 4.2.1 and I think you did a good job, concerning documents in English language. 
I however work mostly in German language. 
When I load a document (XHTML Strict), Amaya stops at the first dieresis with a parsing error. 
That has 
good cause because the diereses are saved not XHTML - compliant as "&amp;auml;" and "&amp;szlig;" but as "?" and "?" because previous versions of Amaya did not support this correctly. 
So I ran the finishing script converting the diereses to XHTML compliance and opened the document again, no errors. 
But as I saved the document back with Amaya, Amaya converted all XHTML-style diereses back to German standard notation. 
The next opening of the selfsame document caused above errors. 
This also applies to other symbols like the copyright (c) and (R). 
I use Amaya under Win NT 4.0 SP6a, but this bug seriously hampers my working. 
Are there possibilities to get back to an older version, like 3.2, the last I was using? 
Could I fix it myself somehow? 
Greetings, Thea Schwabach, Germany 
I believe that XML defaults to UTF-8. 
Have you taken all necessary steps to ensure that everything is assuming ISO 8859/1 (the default for HTML over HTTP).

Hi, The error was in old versions like 3.2 which handled ISO-latin-1 files without setting the encoding The version 4.0 detected these errors and proposed to set the encoding. 
Today the best solution is to add encoding="iso-8859-1" in the xml declaration in the source view and save the document FROM the source view (not from the formatted view). 
HTML and XML use a different default encoding and tools (including previous versions of Amaya) didn't take care of that difference. 
I guess it's already the case today for a lot of browsers that parse HTML and XHTML documents with the same parser. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
It should work better after that change. 
Irene.
