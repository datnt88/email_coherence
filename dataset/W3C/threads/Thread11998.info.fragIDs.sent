<s> We now mention various types of multimedia in techniques.  </s>
<s> I suggest in 2.3.1 (prompting for alternative content) we suggest some stuff for adding alternative content to multimedia, and think about how to deal with multimedia where it is alreday included, such as SMIL presentations.  </s>
<s> My personal feeling is that tools which do not understand SMIL (mostly HTML things - XML tools should generally be able to deal with SMIL itself) should still be providing alternative content for a SMIL presentation.  </s>

<s> CMN: I don't think it is a big worry, but we could leave out "supported by the tool", since it is an obvious precondition from 2.5.1 WL: 2.5.3  </s>

<s> CMN: I think given that it is explicit in the checkpoint we don't need to harp on it in the introduction WL: Perhaps we could use a checkpoint 3.2.3 of priority 3 that provides a display of the document in its full anatomy such as one sees in a browser's "view source document".  </s>

<s> CMN: I will take this as a proposal for a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> (At any rate, it is a technique which can be used to satisfy other stuff - for example the structure View in Amaya makes it trivial to navigate element by element (3.3.1 minimally satisfied...)

<s> CMN: Sounds like a technique to me...
