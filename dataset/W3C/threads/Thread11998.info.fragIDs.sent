Subject line says it all... new checkpoint 2.6.5, plenty of new techniques, definition of conformance to these guidelines updated definition of conformance to other guidelines, abstract. 
(and some minor stuff).

Section 2 intro: Still think should say "content, structure, and presentation" instead of allowing "content" to include all that. 
Note that the first bullet says: "Separate structure and content from presentation;" and later "...higher level problems of overall design, content, description, etc." In short, if one does a search on "content" and determines if it is used as defined in WCAG definition section leave it alone, otherwise expand to "content, structure, and presentation" as this will emphasize the point made in the aforementioned bullet. 
In this posting I will make no further reference to instances of "content" in the document, but there are more. 
2.3 "...assist the author in generating textual equivalents..." I wonder if we might again spell out the other equivalents like audio or whatever. 
2.5.2 Grammar checker should examine this; it's the markup that is known to promote accessibility and the sentence might mean that the tool does it. 
2.5.3 
And wherever else should end with a "." since the others do; also I think all bullets end with ";"? 
2.6.1 
I think we "alert to" not "alert of"? 3 "Ensure that the Authoring Tool is Accessible to Authors with Disabilities" I guess I still think this should be "All Authors" instead of "authors with disabilities". 
The old Universal Design argument. 
Further on: "...accessible to authors with disabilities" might be "accessible to authors of varying skills, styles, and abilities". 
Then "2.The authoring tool frequently encompasses the functionality of a user agent or browser and as such should follow the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. 
[WAI-USERAGENT]" should make it clearer that this refers specifically (exclusively?) to those functions of the authoring tool that mimic a user agent which is made clearer in 3.1.2 
than in the introduction. 
Perhaps we could use a checkpoint 3.2.3 of priority 3 that provides a display of the document in its full anatomy such as one sees in a browser's "view source document". 
Some tools make this hard to get to. 
3.3 "...There are strategies that make it easier to navigate and manipulate a marked up document" cries out for a link to such strategies. 
A general formatting recommendation: There should be a blank line between the end of a technique and the presentation of the next checkpoint; in the present format it looks like the technique belongs to the subsequent, rather than the previous checkpoint. 
I've not gone into the techniques, appendices, etc. Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Section 2 intro: Still think should say "content, structure, and presentation" instead of allowing "content" to include all that.

CMN: I agree. 
We have not done that for this working draft, but I will do it for the draft we will be working on in Toronto. 
WL: 2.3 "...assist the author in generating textual equivalents..." I wonder if we might again spell out the other equivalents like audio or whatever. 
CMN: I think it would just add bloat to the paragraph myself. 
We now mention various types of multimedia in techniques. 
I suggest in 2.3.1 (prompting for alternative content) we suggest some stuff for adding alternative content to multimedia, and think about how to deal with multimedia where it is alreday included, such as SMIL presentations. 
My personal feeling is that tools which do not understand SMIL (mostly HTML things - XML tools should generally be able to deal with SMIL itself) should still be providing alternative content for a SMIL presentation. 
WL: 2.5.2 Grammar checker should examine this; it's the markup that is known to promote accessibility and the sentence might mean that the tool does it. 
CMN: I don't think it is a big worry, but we could leave out "supported by the tool", since it is an obvious precondition from 2.5.1 WL: 2.5.3 
And wherever else should end with a "." since the others do; also I think all bullets end with ";"? 
CMN: I'll put the period into the source on Monday, for future versions. 
Bullets end with semicolons where they are lists of things, except for the last one in the list. 
For techniques, which are listed, they should all be sentences and therefore end with a period. 
WL: 2.6.1 
I think we "alert to" not "alert of"? 
CMN: I usually do - duly noted... WL: 3 "Ensure that the Authoring Tool is Accessible to Authors with Disabilities" I guess I still think this should be "All Authors" instead of "authors with disabilities". 
The old Universal Design argument. 
Further on: "...accessible to authors with disabilities" might be "accessible to authors of varying skills, styles, and abilities". 
CMN: I agree. 
Actually I think that language was in what is now the checking and assisting guidelines - 2.6 WL: Then "2.The authoring tool frequently encompasses the functionality of a user agent or browser and as such should follow the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. 
[WAI-USERAGENT]" should make it clearer that this refers specifically (exclusively?) to those functions of the authoring tool that mimic a user agent which is made clearer in 3.1.2 
than in the introduction. 
CMN: I think given that it is explicit in the checkpoint we don't need to harp on it in the introduction WL: Perhaps we could use a checkpoint 3.2.3 of priority 3 that provides a display of the document in its full anatomy such as one sees in a browser's "view source document". 
Some tools make this hard to get to. 
CMN: I will take this as a proposal for a checkpoint. 
(At any rate, it is a technique which can be used to satisfy other stuff - for example the structure View in Amaya makes it trivial to navigate element by element (3.3.1 minimally satisfied...) WL: 3.3 "...There are strategies that make it easier to navigate and manipulate a marked up document" cries out for a link to such strategies. 
CMN: Sounds like a technique to me... WL: A general formatting recommendation: There should be a blank line between the end of a technique and the presentation of the next checkpoint; in the present format it looks like the technique belongs to the subsequent, rather than the previous checkpoint. 
CMN: Good thought. 
I'll follow it up with the Style gurus (Ian). 
Maybe we should say "Techniques for x.y.z"? 
WL: I've not gone into the techniques, appendices, etc. CMN: What?!?! An hour and a bit and you haven't surveyed every last detail? 
(Just joking. 
Thanks for the comments and thoughts, and the prompt review. 
It's always gratifying to know people are waiting for the thing to "come off the press" as it were.) charles
