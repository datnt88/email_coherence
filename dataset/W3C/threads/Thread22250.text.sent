I've updated build.xml 
to download the new DOM 3 Core and AS/LS working drafts and moved the .patch 
files into a patches directory. 
I spent some time trying to get the test suite runnable from the JUnit GUI test runners. 
Unfortunately, I'm running into ClassNotFound at run time. 
If any of you are masters of the Java class loaders and can diagnose the situation, I would appreciate it. 
The idea is that you would be able to do something like: java -jar junit-run.jar 
and would be able to select a TestSuite for the spec, parser and configuration that interests you. 
(Only org.w3c.domts.level1.core.TestDefaultParser is implemented now, but would expect to have many similar classes if we can get this working) However, if you just do that, you will get a ClassNotFound error for DOMTestSink which should have automatically been on the classpath from the junit-run manifest (in dom1-core.jar) 
I also updated the snapshoted documentcreatecdatasection.java to remove the .xml 
extension. 
Generating that test would typically break Xalan, so a version prepared by Saxon is copied instead. 
But I hadn't updated the copy since the media type changes. 
Java isn't my strongest side; I've tried to get some information about this without success. 
As Curt says, if someone can invest some time into this it would be great as it woul simplify the task of running tests for particular implementations. 
/Dimitris A reply to an email Curt happened to send off-list. 
Yes, I know, I just wanted to notify the DOM Group. 
I'll remove the files this evening. 
/Dimitris [dd] OK, another issue with this is that we should post the two schema files in the CVS repository to avoid confusion (people have tried to validate the tests against the existing dom1.dtd) after build and release. 
The schema and dtd files are generated and should not be in the CVS. 
The better way to avoid confusion would be to remove (or at least annotate) the source of the out-of-date dom1.dtd and have the schemas and DTDs for the various levels available for download. 
The level 1's could be included in the level 1 distribution, but the level 2 and 3 DTD's and schemas should be available for download before the test suites are released.
