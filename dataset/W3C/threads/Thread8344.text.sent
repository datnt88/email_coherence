Julian it's great that you've done this research. 
It helps to get some real data into our planning! 
So contrary to what we believed, protecting conditional PUTs using strong etags currently does not interoperate well at all. 
How do we move forward on this issue? 
I'm not sure. 
Here's my guess: - Decide that preventing lost updates is actually important - Decide that strong ETags is the only way to do that effectively - Exhort server implementors to do a better job of Etags and If header - Put the tests in Litmus -- which I understand you're already doing -- and announce - Hold another interoperability event where we record the results of this effort That holds back draft standard until we can hold another interop event, but if we hold another summer interop as we have the last two years, draft standard would probably take that long anyway. 
Any other ideas? 
Lisa Thanks.

I don't think we need to decide that :-) ...the best... Nope, I'm currently not doing it. 
Joe Orton, are you listening? 
I think it's sufficient to add the test cases to Litmus and make sure that clients submit correct If headers. 
This can be tested without a specific face-to-face meeting... Julian Only with one ear - you'd like all the tests in the update-tests.js 
file you posted re-implemented in litmus?

Basically it's a sequence of - create locked resource - various conditional updates (using PUT) - UNLOCK - some more tests involving if-match and etag Julian
