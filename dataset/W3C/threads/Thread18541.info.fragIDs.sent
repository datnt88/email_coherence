<s> Agenda 1) Review action items (listed at the bottom of this email) 2) Review proposals to address open issues Review of proposals a) I'd like to get confirmation of changes to the speech characteristic checkpoints of the 19 March 2001 draft (as announced: b) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9 c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I don't expect that it will be controversial.]  </s>
<s> d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be minimal requirement.  </s>

<s> Al, can you say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t.  </s>
<s> system-captions? h) We need to add to the Techniques document for the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7.  </s>

<s> Deadline: 2/1/2001 Source: CMN: Find out from SYMM WG whether repositioning of objects will appear in the spec (or should be in UAAG).  </s>
<s> Source: TL: Report to WG on discussions at Microsoft about keyboard emulation.  </s>
<s> Source: RS: Send pointer to information about universal access gateway to the WG.  </s>
<s> Source: Completed action items IJ: Take to the cross-WG WAI list the issue of how to refer to UAAG (or other WAI specs) in non-W3C documents Source: Email to CG: Completed action items available in 19 March 2001 draft IJ: Work on editorial changes to 2.9.  </s>
<s> Include an example (e.g., "alt" for IMG in HTML).  </s>

<s> Addition: Issue 468 [1]: The "at least a majority" minimal requirement needs review.  </s>
<s> Refer to Al's email [2]: On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the default key bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations.  </s>
<s> The group should reconsider this language.  </s>
<s> If the default key binding defines a full set of single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is _no way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key binding] to single-key bindings.  </s>
<s> Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key, or twelve-key device in use.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure I understand what that means.  </s>

<s> UAAG talks about functionalities first, and then makes requirements about the nature and number of input device bindings to activate those functionalities.  </s>

<s> There are two responses: 1.  </s>
<s> You only have a certain number of key so you are constrained in the number of single keyboard bindings to the number you have.  </s>
<s> 2. The minimal set of functions that should be available is 11.4.  </s>
<s> PROPOSAL: 1. Can we just referrence checkpoint 11.4, rather than use the "at least majority" term.  </s>
<s> 2. An alternative would be to say to allow any single key bindings to be reassigned to a single key binding without a modifier keys.  </s>
