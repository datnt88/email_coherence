<s> We are trying to use HTML tidy version 13th January, and are experiencing a removing them in the cleaing process.  </s>
<s> We have tried teaching tidy about these tags as empty and also as inline, but neither have been successful.  </s>
<s> Is there any way to teach tidy that these tags are not empty, but contain an  </s>
<s> attribute, even though there is nothing in between the tags?  </s>
<s> Attached please find a copy of our config file, in which we defined the Tidy requirements.  </s>
<s> Any insight you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks. Karen Schlesinger &amp; Scott Shandler  </s>
<s> What possible reason would you have for empty tags?  </s>
<s> What are you trying to style when there is nothing to style inside the tags?  </s>
<s> According to the DTD, TABLE requires TBODY, either explicitly or implicitly, which in turn requires at least one TR where each contains at least one TD or TH.  </s>
<s> It is just not legal to have TABLE /TABLE , ID attribute or no. (Adjust case appropriately for XML.)  </s>
<s> With DHTML (the DOM) you can add content.  </s>
<s> You can tell Tidy to leave empty P s alone with the "drop-empty-paras" option, but apparently not DIVs or SPANS.  </s>
<s> I've previously tricked Tidy before by  </s>
<s> IMO, there should be a "drop-empty-elements-with-IDs" option (though with hopefully a shorter name :).  </s>
<s> Or better yet, just a "drop-empty-elements" option, period.  </s>
<s> drop-empty-paras was too focused on one element.  </s>

<s> I have run into a problem I need to get clear in my mind.  </s>
<s> Tidy allows (and creates) the following URL formats.  </s>
<s> The W3C validator passes the following URL formats.  </s>
<s> a href=  </s>
<s> "http://www.xxxxxxx.com/yyyyyy/zzzzzz.htm" a href="http://www.xxxxxxxl.com/yyyyyy/zzzzzz.htm"  </s>
<s> Are the above valid but bad HTML?  </s>
<s> Should a URL be all on one line unbroken like the following?  </s>
<s> Chuck  </s>
<s> After the  and the element name, you can have any whitespace before and after  </s>
<s> the attribute name, before and after the = sign, or between the attribute value  </s>
<s> and the closing  of the start tag.  </s>
<s> Bad?  </s>
<s> How so?  </s>
<s> The following is perfectly valid:  </s>
<s> a href = "foo"  </s>
<s> If by bad, you mean hard-to-read, well yes -- in that example.  </s>
<s> But in the case  </s>
<s> of long URLs, it sometimes makes sense to linebreak before or after attributes,  </s>
<s> since you don't want to break the URL itself.  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> I that, I believe, is possible also for elements that lack id.  </s>
<s> Since an id is not really necessary for an empty span to have (or get) meaning this is not entirely logical.  </s>

<s> Thank You I originally had the same thought but was being led astray.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Baslock  </s>
<s> after  </s>
<s> value  </s>
<s> case  </s>
<s> attributes,  </s>
<s> Another reason is that you can use style sheets to style the empty element.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons I won't let Tidy loose on the RichInStyle.com test suite (http://richinstyle.com/test) is that it takes exception to things like div style="background: red; height: 100px; width: 100px; border: solid; float: left" , dropping them and making the test page useless.  </s>
<s> Yes. There should be a way of saying "leave empty elements alone, period".  </s>
<s> It probably ought to even be the default.  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Thanks for your feedback.  </s>
<s> I am working on tweaking the rules tidy uses to prune empty elements.  </s>
<s> However, an empty table element is an error according to the HTML specs.  </s>
<s> I would be grateful if you could explain why you need an empty table element?  </s>

<s> Can't the empty tags be inserted themselves in the same manner relative to the position of contentful markup (:before/:after)?  </s>
<s> AFAIK, the only tags that make sense when empty are TD, TH (which can be made to render as non-empty using CSS), and BODY.  </s>
<s> Even empty paragraphs make no sense in HTML (how can you reasonably describe nothingness as a paragraph?) except as a presentational abuse of HTML.  </s>
