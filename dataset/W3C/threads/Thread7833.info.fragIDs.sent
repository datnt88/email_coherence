<s> Lately I have been leaning to introducing new  </s>

<s> For  </s>

<s> header to create a subscription and with a Subscription-ID header but no NT header to renew a subscription.  </s>
<s> The result is that I had to put in some fairly confusing language to explain what to do if a request has both a NT and a Subscription-ID header.  </s>
<s> After that experience I just introduce a  </s>
<s> RESUBSCRIBE method to simplify things.  </s>
<s> Of course, this isn't a perfect  </s>

<s> =)  </s>
<s> I don't think that the "method for each variant of each operation" scales.  </s>
<s> I can think of 4 or 5 groups that would like to pick SUBSCRIBE to mean something slightly different.  </s>
<s> One of the advantages of live  </s>

<s> I agree  </s>

<s> to pay in order to avoid name collisions as more extensions to WebDAV  </s>

<s> Note: there currently are few enough WebDAV extensions, that I could get the names I want for bindings, redirect references, and even versioning, but I can already the cursing of subsequent protocol developers  </s>

<s> Geoff, I hope you aren't seriously expecting me to engage in a debate with  </s>
<s> you whose foundation is the need to preserve pretty method names.  </s>
<s> It really doesn't matter if the name is SUBSCRIBE or S#*&amp;!@.  </s>
<s> Other than the later will probably cause more typo-s.  </s>
<s> If using multiple names will help interoperability and my experience leads me to believe that this is so, then we should use multiple names.  </s>
<s> To hell with conserving pretty names.  </s>
<s> OK, I'll admit that was weak.  </s>
<s> I will defer to your implementation experience here, and like Eric, I will start saying "use a METHOD" in a monotone voice until some stronger argument occurs to me or someone else (:-).  </s>
<s> In particular, I will make a pass through the versioning protocol and see what impact this would have.  </s>
