I wrote these yesterday but wanted to make sure to review the minutes before posting to avoide possible redundancy. 1 splitting dynamic and static may result in half inplementation. 
even though it might be considered that static be p2, a case can be made for it being p1. 
I cannot make that case as well as perhaps gg or hans might or another at developer. 
Rich may be able to help with this too. 
They are often one entity. 
2 I got it from gg finally that we have two concerns. 
one is getting the process in the same manner and at the same time as the ua and the other is being able to perform manipulations on the document and provide timely rendering in at. 
I think it can then be expressed this way in a checkpoint or almost this way: Provide ats with the ability to access and manipulate the document at the same performance level as that for the ua. 
Thoughts?

David, My preference is that we talk about the timing of exchanging of information and the synchronization/control of event notification issues in the checkpoints that deal with the exchange of information and notification of events. 
I thnik this is the simplest way to deal with the issue and still make developers aware of the issues. 
I think we should state the issues as an important part of implementing these checkpoints and include known techniques in the techniques document. 
But Ian wants to propose a checkpoint to the group and we will wait and see what he or other group members come up with during the next week.

David, I like the idea of equivalence, and I think that it is definable by a "reasonable person."
