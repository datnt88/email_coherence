"Tables - Some web-devices need to linearize tables. 
Avoid complex tables or add header and cell scope information if needed." 
Perhaps "...Avoid complex tables; add header and cell scope information." 
That's OK with me.

Because tables are commonly used and are hard to access for users of screen readers and Braille displays, the point about tables cries for an explanation as to why it is included on a tip sheet. 
Yet, I don't think a tip sheet is the place to introduce readers to assistive technologies. 
How about this? 
"Some web technologies cannot render tables." 
I suggest the expression "web technologies" instead of "web devices" because screen readers and refreshable Braille displays are both software and hardware, and "device" doesn't capture that. 
I don't know whether this wording excludes other web-devices that have trouble dealing with tables. 
What other devices are there? 
Two questions for the more HTML-savvy members of our group: 1. 
What makes a table "complex?" 
Or, when is a table "complex?" 
I don't understand the point. 
A "simple" two-column table is often impossible to decipher for a screen reader user. 
2. Which browsers support "header and cell scope information?" 
And where can I read up on this subject?

We discussed complexity of table on the Guidelines list but never reached a real conclusion. 
The issue is the following: how we draw the line between work the author has to do vs. work the browser can do. 
For tables, I personally think putting it all on the author's hand is too much asking and that user agents can easily make simple tables accessible (look at lynx for the level 0 support: ignore the table markup and print out the content as is). 
None at that point I think. 
You can read about that in the HTML4 spec or in the WAI HTML Access paper
