The keyboard shortcut "Alt =" to "Zoom in" does not seem work on a Swedish keyboard layout on an English Widows 2000 system. 
Since the "=" is located 
in the upper shift of the numeral "0" you have to do an "Alt Shift 0" which 
of course gives you the characters "0=" instead of the function "Zoom in". 
It is probably possible for the customer to customise this to use another control sequence, but this should work right out of the box.

it isn't working anymore on my Mac either (linux version 7.2 - I don't know what version it stopped working) with an Australian (very close to US) keyboard layout.

The solution is to adapt the configuration file Amaya/config/amaya.kb to your keyboard. 
You can define a personal copy in your AmayaHome directory. 
Where is located the + key in your keyboard? 
It's possible to define two shortcuts for the same function in the standard configuration file.

Why should I? 
Is this behaviour not defined in any user interface standard, de jure, de facto, or proprietary, which could be of any use? 
Lower case, key 12 in the upper row of the alphanumerical section. 
This keyboard layout has the IBM designation KBD153.
