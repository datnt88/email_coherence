Organization: ThinkingCat Enterprises Subject: Re: OIDs as URI/URNs.... (I'm not cross-posting, 'cause your listserv stripped the XMLDSIG list address cc: off your posting, and I don't know what it is :-) I'd have some concern about: what happens when there is discrepancy between the digit and textual representations (i.e., it's an error). 
I'm not entirely sure that the XML problem couldn't be solved by a convention of a comment line that accompanies any identifier, to spell out what they need. 
But, that's fairly top-of-my-head.

Hi everyone, I'm crossposting this between the URN Working Group and the XMLDSIG Working group. 
The issue is whether or not the OID URN namespace document that is the process of being published should be ammended to include the textual representation of the node in the OID tree. the issue is whether the OID URN NID should look like this: urn:oid:itu-t(0)/identified-organization(4)/etsi(0)/electronic-signature-sta ndard(1733)/part1(1)/idupMechanism(4)/etsiESv1(1) (note, the slashes would have to be changed or encoded since slashes are deprecated in URNs due to hierarchy semantics in RFC 2396) or like this: urn:oid:0.4.0.1733.1.4.1 XMLDSIG apparently has some requirements for readability that is considered dangerous for the persistence requirements for URNs. 
Should I update the pending RFC 3001 and resubmit or should it go forward as is?

Hmm...interesting. 
URNs have the soft requirement of not being human readable. 
Where is the expection coming from for a user seeing and needing to understand an OID? the main purpose for use to use OIDs in URIs is in XML signatures. 
there we will need to use OIDs in form of URIs to refer to policies, other documents, ... that are already present and hav an OID. because XML has the great advantage that it is plain text, it can be read (debugged) by humans by just viewing it with any text editor. 
URIs are normally in form that you can roughly get an idea what's behind it. 
if we just use the pure number presentation of OIDs, i think (and others share this opinion) we are going to lose one advantage. 
however, i am aware of the fact that it is not absolutely required to work. 
but it was a requirement in designing XML "XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear". 
i think a pure number presentation of OIDs does not meet this requirements.

ITU-T Rec. 
X.660 series states that the number form of an OID is mandatory, but not the name form. 
Hence the number form takes precedence. 
Olivier DUBUISSON france telecom R&amp;D _ DTL/MSV - 22307 Lannion Cedex - France \_/\ Site ASN.1 : http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/ you can never prevent anyone from making errors in principle. 
but i admit that you should try to, if we can. 
but it's the same, if you encode an OID in an ASN.1 specification: no one prevents you from writing wrong OIDs. 
i don't think that a comment is the actual solution we are talking about (at least not me). because for a comment, we need not to discuss the syntax. 
but, comments will of course be used additionally where applicable.

It is important to recognize that the Name 'form' of an ASN.1 OID is not normative and is not transmitted in the ASN.1 encoding. 
As a result working groups defining OIDS do not in general take particular care or even any care whatsoever to ensure that the name form of the OID is unique and unambiguous. 
As with any spec half the discussion on any given ASN.1 schema is quite likely to involve discussion on the naming of variables and identifiers. 
I have participated in working groups where OIDs have been renamed from one draft to another on several occasions. 
I have done the same thing myself. 
The number form is generaly treaded with considerable respect and care however. 
I am absolutely opposed to attempts to provide 'clarity' that introduce ambiguity and are almost certain to introduce errors and complexity into programs. 
Using the name form of an OID for a purpose that was not intended falls into that category in my opinion. 
The name form is unnecessary and will introduce confusion complexity and error into applications. 
It should be rejected. 
Michael's original proposal is fine as is.
