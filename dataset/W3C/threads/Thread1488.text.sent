My memory from mailing list discussions was the supported-live-property-set should present property names the same way they're presented in other XML, e.g. in propfind requests and responses. 
The spec says: 3.1.4 
DAV:supported-live-property-set (protected) This property identifies the live properties that are supported by the resource. 
A live property is supported by a resource if that property has the semantics defined for that property. 
The value of this property MUST identify all live properties defined by this document that are supported by the resource, and SHOULD identify all live properties that are supported by the resource. 
ANY value: a property element type I believe this should read: 3.1.4

ANY value: a property element type -- Lisa This is the last message I could find regarding this issue: That makes sense and would be fine with me ("name" and "prop" even have the same number of characters :-). 
If nobody objects, I'll make that change. 
I think this easily fits within the "minor editorial change" criteria.

ANY value: a property element type -- Lisa Yes, that was what I remembered (i.e. the question was asked, the reason for not doing so was given, and there was no further discussion). 
But given the minor nature of the marshalling change, if nobody disagrees, I'd be willing to make the change. 
But even a single disagreement would veto the change. 
Any vetos?
