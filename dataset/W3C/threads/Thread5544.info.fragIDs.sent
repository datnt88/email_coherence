<s> ~ Shawn  </s>
<s> Glad to note that this version has implemented most of suggestions made on Jan 2, 2004 (see below).  </s>
<s> I find this more easy to navigate and the structure is clearer.  </s>
<s> One inconsistency at the page start however, under "On this page" : The h3 level headings for item #5 are listed as a to e and these are not coded as links.  </s>
<s> However the h3 level items forTraining and Events are not listed at all under item#4.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the a to e items under #5 be knocked off too.  </s>
<s> Sorry I am not able to attend the meetings.  </s>
<s> E-mail of Jan 2 is attached for ease of reference.  </s>

<s> Shawn replies: Thanks for the feedback, Sailesh! 1.  </s>
<s> I wonder if it's OK to list the h3 level headings where they are important to clarify the content under h2 heading, and not to list the h3 level headings where they are not important to clarify the content?  </s>
<s> See the revised version for a suggestion of where subheadings are needed in the list at top and where they are not needed - at: 2. will probably link all of the list at the top later (just didn't get to it for rough draft)  </s>
<s> MessageShawn, The site map after all serves as a table of content for the entire site and as the site map has over a hundred links, a navigational bar that lists the main categories under which links are grouped is sufficient in my opinion.  </s>
<s> If these main groups are not over 5 or 6, it might be even ok if there is no skip nav link for them.  </s>
<s> Else one is desirable.  </s>
<s> So I strongly feel that the h3 and lower level headings should be kept out of the top nav bar and duplication be avoided.  </s>
<s> Another thought: If the main groups are being numbered, then the h2 level items too should be prefixed with the corresponding numbers.  </s>
