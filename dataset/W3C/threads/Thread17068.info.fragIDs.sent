<s> I've been working on a page that has a lot of fill in the blanks type examples on it and am wondering if the input type="text" size="n" tag makes good sense as a replacement for the underscores indicating where words and letters  </s>
<s> ought to be filled in.  </s>
<s> I know I'm not using the input tags in a form but I'm hoping that it'll improve the page's renddering via screen readers.  </s>

<s> If you're supporting Netscape 4.x on this page, the INPUT tags won't render.  </s>

<s> One alternative would be to use an image to provide the underline and then use appropriate alt text.  </s>
<s> Interesting.  </s>
<s> What alt text would make sense in a fill in the blank in a sentence like "The snow man melted in the underscore underscore underscore underscore."  </s>
<s> How about alt="blank," ?  </s>
<s> If you were reading the page to a class, how would you read it?  </s>

<s> That's true; it ignores all form fields when they do not appear within a form element.  </s>
<s> Although Netscape 4 is finally losing importance, this problem is still relevant here, since the fields have a very essential role in the plan.  </s>

<s> It causes some risks, since the form might get accidentally submitted.  </s>
<s> In fact, several browsers submit a form if you hit Enter in an input field!  </s>
<s> And using action="" won't help, since it will be taken as referring to (the start of) the current document.  </s>
<s> There are different ways to cope with such problems, but some problems will remain.  </s>
<s> Perhaps most importantly, although the plan is an interesting invention and sounds good first, it has a fundamental problem: an input element still _means_ user input, not just a presentation of a placeholder.  </s>
<s> In particular, a normal speech browser can be expected to _stop_ whenever it encounters such an element and prompt the user for input, or at least go to a state of waiting for user input or user's explicit request to go forward.  </s>
<s> After all, this is what they really need to do for normal forms with normal input fields.  </s>
<s> Jukka Korpela, senior adviser TIEKE Finnish Information Society Development Centre  </s>
<s> That's a reasonable behaviour on NN4's part - input elements can't appear outside of a form so anything a browser does or doesn't do with them is unspecified.  </s>
<s> By HTML syntax, all form field elements _may_ appear outside a form too.  </s>
<s> I just checked this and indeed you are correct and I was wrong.  </s>
<s> (I know it's bad form to reply on-list to an off-list mail, but one must correct one's inaccurate statements).  </s>
<s> By HTML syntax, all form field elements _may_ appear outside a form too.  </s>
<s> This was an HTML 4 change, and I think the intention was to allow their use in server side scripting with no fallback for that field, making such fields redundant in a proper accessible design.  </s>
