<s> Hi, It's nice to see progress on the Time text spec's, I feel there is a missed opportunity to make Timed text more than a captioning format, not that captioning isn't important.  </s>
<s> If TT also could provide fading in and out, the text can be used like an image or sound in presentation, it can be another expressive media element.  </s>
<s> This is an previously posted example from the old TT mailing list: (HTML+SMIL for IE 6, about a minute long and 1MB, preloaded) Now the same presentation without fading: If linking were added, Timed text can be used to jump to other parts of the document or any other resource on the web.  </s>
<s> It would be a real web  </s>
<s> language, without the 'A' element it's a neutered language.  </s>
<s> Good luck all, Jose Ramirez  </s>
<s> I agree it is worth considering fade transitions.  </s>
<s> I have received input from a number of sources that have suggested this as a requirement as well.  </s>

<s> It would be great to see fade in &amp; out become a requirement :) Text in multimedia shouldn't take a back seat to audio and images.  </s>
<s> Simply by allowing text to fade in and out of a piece, give TT a chance to become a part of the presentation instead of an add on, like a bumper sticker to a car.  </s>
<s> I see linking also as being an essential feature.  </s>
<s> With 'A' TT can be used as a table of contents of a multimedia document, TT can supply links to a MMS version or larger version of the same content for a digital home entertainment system.  </s>
<s> Linking give a small language the power to access Web.  </s>
<s> Thanks for replying Glenn.  </s>
<s> Take care, Jose Ramirez  </s>
<s> We have already agreed that hyperlink behavior is a requirement.  </s>
