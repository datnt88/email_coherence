<s> Hi Nick,  </s>
<s> In the current Valet output, the following:-  </s>
<s> earl:validity rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#fails"/ should be:- earl:validity rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#Fail"/  </s>
<s> Apart from that, it seems alright: good work.  </s>
<s> What's all this about using Content-Location?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you mean,  </s>
<s> but note that "Content-Location" simply points to a resource whose associated representations are the same as the subject resource.  </s>
<s> It does not mean that the resources are equivalent, necessarily, from the Semantic Web/RDF point of view.  </s>
<s> It one of those points that could only ever get raised on an RDF list, though.  </s>

<s> Will fix that next time I log in and tinker with it.  </s>
<s> The webservice parses XML you POST to it.  </s>
<s> That is to say, anonymous input.  </s>
<s> It assigns it a system identifier of modxml:input.  </s>
<s> Jim wanted to be able to post a document from a URL, and have the results refer to that URL.  </s>
<s> So we decided in chat to use the Content-Location HTTP header.  </s>
<s> If the Client sets a Content-Location,  </s>
<s> mod_xml will (now) use that as the System Identifier of the input.  </s>

<s> That was actually one of the problems we ran into in our discussion yesterday - earl doesn't seem to have a property that uses earl:fails as a value.  </s>
<s> I picked earl:validity because it seemed the closest thing to suggest at the moment, even though it's technically incorrect.  </s>
<s> So assuming a user is really set on using earl:fails instead of just earl:Fail, but wants to qualify their predicate with other properties like Nick does, what would you suggest?  </s>
<s> Nadia  </s>
<s> Consider that user A wants to use {earl:fails :myLevel :Severe} and user B wants to use {earl:fails :level :Light} (or even that user A later wants to use a different level).  </s>
<s> When you merge the two you get a conflict; you  </s>
<s> can't declare things about terms in the EARL namespace that you don't know to be true, and in this case aren't true.  </s>
<s> Note that we already have a confidence level set for earl:fails: {earl:fails earl:confidence earl:High (earl:Certain in the latest draft)}.  </s>
<s> earl:Fail is there so that people can create their own properties, with  </s>
<s> different confidence levels or whatever; these properties do not have to be anonymous, of course.  </s>
<s> Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://purl.org/net/swn# .  </s>
<s> :Sean :homepage http://purl.org/net/sbp/ .  </s>
<s> Erm, you're dealing with qualifiers that are subjective measures.  </s>
<s> The severity property for a validation error is clearly defined, so if two validators disagree then one of them is buggy.  </s>
<s> These errors are Confidence: Certain.  </s>
<s> Severity is a different property.  </s>
<s> Likewise, when a document fails validation, errorCount is a property of that failure.  </s>
<s> The point is that an RDF predicate may need to have properties additional to an earl:Fail.  </s>
