Following the recent discussion about the maturity of DeltaV, I wonder if it might be an option to submit DeltaV as an informational RFC. 
On the one hand, this might satisfy people that want to see some 'official' RFC before starting to work on software. 
On the other hand, an informational RFC is probably much easier to change than a proposed standard RFC, which is a standard tracks document. 
Just have a look at the HTTP protocol: As of May 1996, HTTP was still issued as informational RFC (RFC 1945), although there had been HTTP server implementations running since 1990, i.e. for about 6 years. 
HTTP switched to a proposed standard not earlier than in January 1997 (RFC 2068). 
The bottom line here is, that HTTP became a proposed standard not before there were many implementations available revealing all the bugs and weaknesses of earlier HTTP protocol versions. 
In my opinion, WebDAV suffers from this experience; and DeltaV should do it better than WebDAV! 
Greetings, Juergen Agh... no way. 
This *is* a standards track document. 
Nothing less.

According to RFC 2026, section 4.2, an Informational RFC is *not* on the standards track.
