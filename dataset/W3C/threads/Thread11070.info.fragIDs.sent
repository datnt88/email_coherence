Dear Developers of XML : 
XML really, really needs notation data attributes. 
Without them, you can't do object inheritance from architecture (DTD) to architecture 
(document, whether it has its own DTD or not). 
An inheritable architecture is, in fact, a notation. 
We already support notations in XML. 
What we don't have is the ability to declare the mappings between the inherited architecture's objects (elements and attributes) and the document's objects (elements and attributes). 
For that, we need notation data attributes. 
It's a small thing, really, but, wow, what a difference it makes! 
The usefulness of inheritance for all kinds of purposes (and not least for EDI) is too great to ignore; it is one of the most useful and 
attractive aspects of SGML. 
There is no good reason not to do it in 
XML. So, how about it, ERB? 
For a discussion of why architectural inheritability is overwhelmingly important, you may want to read my (now slightly dated) paper, "SGML Architectures: Implications and Opportunities for Industry" at

I would humbly submit that this is nonsense :-) 
I can conceive of a world in which object inheritance is performed without SGML notation data attributes, and I have no difficulty in doing so. 
It's a small thing, really, but, wow, what a difference it makes! 
I think you need to give some more concrete examples than "wow" :-), and 
to explain exactly why this cannot be done with CDATA attributes or with processing instructions or in some other way. 
Well, that's very subjective. 
I for one would strongly disagree. 
I'd happily get by without them. 
In fact, I generally do. 
So do most of our customers. 
Remember, we are not going for the high-end complex SGML applications here. 
We are going for pervasive, easy to implement, easy to understand and easy to describe. 
It makes the specification longer. 
It adds cost and complexity to implementations. 
It brings with it a whole new set of convepts to explain and understand. 
And it is, as far as I can tell, totally unnecessary. 
There is no reason _to_ implement notation data attributes. 
If SGML had been designed so that when I say the xxxxxx woud be handled externally without going through the parser, so that embedded &amp;amp; or / wouldn't cause a syntax error, the ability to include inline notations would probably be more useful. 
As it is, since the content will be treated as PCDATA, you do not gain anything by using an attribute whose value is a notation name. 
Furthermore, there is no way to enforce or chek this without a DTD. 
This paper does not mention using notation data attributes -- it says 
that CDATA attributes should be used. 
I agree with it.

OK. For a document to declare that it inherits the characteristics of a DTD (an architecture) is very, very similar to a !DOCTYPE declaration. 
(In fact, that's exactly what a doctype declaration does.) A doctype declaration determines the DTD in effect, which governs the element structure as evidenced by the generic identifiers of the elements. 
In contrast, an *inherited architecture* does not necessarily constrain the structure of every element in the document; it only constrains the structure of those elements that have an attribute (usually named after the inherited architecture) whose value is the generic identifier that would be used by an element in a document that is actually governed (in the normal way) by the inherited DTD. 
For example, let's say we're writing an XML document that has no DTD, but we want some of the elements to be processed exactly as if they were certain well-known element types found in the HTML architecture (i.e., the HTML DTD). 
According to ISO/IEC 10744 TC1 Annex A.3 (a draft version can be found at ftp://ftp.ornl.gov/pub/sgml/wg8/hytime/1920.sgm [search for "A.3"]), you can declare the HTML architecture as a notation, and as the value of the "ArcFormA" attribute of that notation, you give the name of the attribute used to give the "architectural form name" (the element type in the HTML architecture) to which you intend that element to conform. 
I'm leaving out the details, but here's the gist: !ATTLIST #NOTATION HTML30 ... ArcFormA NAME html ... and in the document, the element can now be recognized and processed as an HTML a element, because html=a, even though its GI is not "a" and it has a "zorp" attribute that is extraneous as far as the HTML architecture is concerned. 
The fact that an inherited architectural form can be further specialized (perhaps by adding a zorp attribute) is why an inherited architecture is called an "enabling" architecture, and, by contrast, the DTD referenced by a doctype declaration is called a "constraining" architecture. 
(You can't necessarily tell, by looking at a DTD, whether it is intended to be used as a constraining architecture, an enabling architecture, or both. 
Any DTD can be used as an enabling architecture, as well as a constraining ( !DOCTYPE...) one.) In order to allow enabling architectures to be declared, notation attributes are needed to specify how the mapping from the inherited architecture to this document's elements is specified. 
(And for several other reasons having to do with the housekeeping necessary to facilitate inheritance and multiple inheritance, any one of which would be sufficient justification for the use of notation attributes.) I say again: XML needs notation attributes. 
The importance of having this feature, in terms of the ultimate usefulness of XML, can hardly be overstated. 
But there is a standard way of doing it, and there is no reason to do it some other way. 
More to the point, for an inheriting document or architecture to characterize an inherited architecture as a notation is simply good SGML. 
You can do anything with anything. 
It's a good idea to consider carefully the advantages and disadvantages of all ways of doing it. 
That work has already been done by some pretty good minds. 
You owe it to yourself to take a look at what they've done. 
I think you'd find it hard to justify to your customers an attitude that object-oriented information management, with the possibility of inheriting the semantics of multiple architectures (each of which may already be implemented in reusable software), is something they should continue to "happily get by without". 
Well..., I don't know about that. 
Is it really so hard for people to understand that they can have rigorous no-fail interchangeability AND arbitrary local extensions in their information architectures, and that they may save themselves a lot of software money and implementation headaches by using inheritance? 
Maybe so. 
I think not. 
I'll wager that if you ask EDI people what's the biggest problem with EDI, they'll tell you "inflexibility." 
If you ask most of the people who have ever had to write SGML documents to a DTD that they didn't control what they hated most about SGML, it's always the DTD, and the rigidity that it forced upon them in the name of information interchange. 
With inherited ("enabling") architectures, you can have it both ways: perfect interchangeability as well as flexibility (read: locally controlled mods, extensions, and even whole DTDs). 
XML made the DTD optional, but that's the easy part. 
On what basis will interchange occur? 
I guess that's true, if you take the position that inheritance is useless and inexplicable. 
If, however, you take the position that inheritance is mighty important, as I believe, then you have to decide how you're going to interchange information about inheritance. 
Regardless of whether you use notation data attributes or some other mechanism, it will add cost and complexity, and you'll have to explain and understand it, too. 
That's right. 
That paper says nothing about how a document declares the fact that it inherits the syntactical and semantic features of another DTD. 
As I said, it discusses reasons why the notion of inheritance is overwhelmingly important.
