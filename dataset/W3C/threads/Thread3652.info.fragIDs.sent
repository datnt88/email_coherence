Chaps, This is a draft proposed response to Charles' comments on the first WD of Authoring Techniques. 
Please check before I send. 
If I hear nothing in a few days, I'll just send. 
RI Hello Charles, Thankyou for your comments on the first WD of Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization. Please find responses below. 
Note also that we intend to release new working drafts before the AC 
meeting. 
We have, in the meantime, split the original document up into 3 topic-focussed documents. 
We aim to produce more such documents as we 
develop the material. 
The in-edit versions of the new documents are: Characters and Encodings 1.0 Specifying the language of content 1.0 Handling Bidirectional Text 1.0

On Behalf Of Charles McCathieNevile Sent: 11 October 2003 18:11 Subject: Authoring Techniques Document A handful of comments on the first draft... 0. Congratulations!! 
This is a great thing, and lots of us are discovering that we would really like this kind of information from a reasonably authorative group. 
Thanks ! 
1. 
Where are the archives for the comments list? 
They don't seem to be linked in the start of the document, just mentioned in text. 
We will fix this in the next version. 
Thanks. 
2. The section on language tagging - http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-i18n-html-tech-20031009/ #ri20030218.131124329 - doesn't clarify something that the HTML specification doesn't make clear. 
If a document contains 2 languages, can you use html lang="it en" or is this wrong? 
Multiple languages in the html tag are not allowed. 
RFC3066 provides the rules for these values. 
It may be possible to do this in the HTTP header - we will look into it - but it is not clear to us that user agents would know what to do in such a situation. 
3. One use of hreflang is to allow for user-side addition of graphic markers. 
A stylesheet rule such as a[hreflang = en]:before { content: url('engflag.gif') 
} or a[hreflang = en]:before { content: url('OzFlag.gif') 
} or its XSLT equivalent allows people to select the way languages are represented - avoiding a cultural insensitivity that causes many people to otherwise avoid providing any graphic idenitfier - something that would be helpful for low-literacy users in particular, and provide rapid recognition for many people. 
Thanks for bringing the use of hreflang to our attention. 
We agree that we should mention this type of usage in the document, although clearly signpost that it doesn't work for IE and possibly other browsers (which makes its application limited, unfortunately, at present, though we would like to see it become more widespread). 
Where we disagree is the use of flags. 
These are associated with countries, rather than languages. 
We also feel that text would be better than graphics on most user agents for people who need to view at larger sizes. 
Karl outlines a method whereby the value of the hreflang attribute is used in square brackets. 
This seems better, as it reduces complexity and bandwidth (albeit slightly). 
4. No mention is made of the technique of using link rel="alternate" hreflang="xx" ... The link element is now widely implemented in browsers (Internet Explorer and Safari are the only two reasonably well-known browsers that don't implement it), and as a backup for language negotitation (analagous to including charset metadata) it seems worthwhile. 
It would also enable easier searching for language variants rather than simply offering auto-translated versions. 
Many large organisations make extensive use of Dublin Core metadata, which would allow them to generate this relatively simply... 
Thanks for bringing this up. 
We will look into it. 
We know that the link element is recognised in some user agents, but we are not clear whether user agents do anything with the language related information specifically. 
Do you have more details of how this works? 
We plan to write some tests for this. 
5. Is there a way to provide examples without participating in the task force? 
I work in several groups who are interested in this work, but where many participants don't speak english, which makes attempting to participate in an english-speaking group a waste of time. 
Some of them have ready-to-hand examples available, but it isn't clear if there is a good way to submit those without finding a friendly bislama-speaking (or whatever language is relevant) member of the task force. 
We're not really clear about what you are asking for here, or who you have in mind and specifically what they would want to contribute. 
Could you clarify? 
Note also that we are concerned about IPR issues. 
WG members have agreed to the IPR policy on signup. 
We are not clear about how to handle general contributions. 
Thanks again for your comments, Best regards, Richard Ishida For the GEO task force

I just implemented this for the following pages: 
I see that in Firebird at the bottom of my screen it now says "More". 
Clicking on that pops up "Other versions  ", and clicking on that pops up 
"French: Version fran?aise" or "English: English version" (depending on which file) and clicking on *that* takes you to the other page. 
The "English:" or "French:" text is generated from the hreflang information. 
The rest comes from the title attribute of the link element. 
Thinking about how useful that is: I guess that if I spoke the language my user agent speaks but not that of the page - eg. 
I landed on a page in an incomprehensible language - I could look for a version in my language easily enough. 
Can't help thinking that it's better to plonk it right at the top of the page, though, like we currently do. 
If I was using someone else's browser with a UI in, say, Persian, I'd be stuck unless I was familiar enough with the UA to guess my way through the menu at the bottom. 
I don't see any support in my latest versions of Mozilla or Netscape (other 
than looking in the Page Info - which is not very helpful). 
Nor in Opera. 
Hardly surprising, couldn't see any support in IE. Andrew, for your test file you could try varying the presence of the hreflang info &amp; title info.

Just did a quick test as well, an interesting aspect is that if Firefox "knows" the language code it will insert the name of the language. 
If it doesn't recognise the language code, it inserts the language code itself rather than a language name.

Actually, Mozilla (1.6) supports it. 
If there are ' link rel="xxxx"... 's, Mozilla adds just above the page rendering area a new menu bar(?) consisting of 'Top Up First Previous Next Last Document More'.

Thanks for that, Jungshik. 
I downloaded the latest version and see that it does indeed work.
