<s> FYI. Some user requirements!  </s>
<s> From Nick Gassman at British Airways, who  </s>
<s> I met at the W3C/NIST Usability Workshop last week.  </s>
<s> RI  </s>
<s> [mailto:nick.1.gassman@britishairways.com] Richard, it was good to meet you again at the workshop.  </s>
<s> You'll recall that I spoke to you about a resource that I felt would be  </s>
<s> useful, and thought I'd put virtual pen to paper to clarify what I was  </s>
<s> talking about.  </s>
<s> It would be great if something like this could appear on  </s>
<s> the W3C site (failing that, if you know of any other site that has the  </s>
<s> information).  </s>
<s> I'll try to send you a separate email with comments on the W3C site as you requested.  </s>
<s> The audience for the languages resoource would range from programmers to  </s>
<s> ecommerce execs who need to understand the components that need to be  </s>
<s> put together to result in a multi-lingual website.  </s>
<s> It would cover the issues end-to-end, including:-  </s>
<s> 1) how do I represent different languages and character sets on my PC  </s>
<s> (or Mac etc...), because that's what I'm using to code my site.?  </s>
<s> 2) how do languages relate to character sets and fonts.  </s>
<s> How can I tell  </s>
<s> what I've got?  </s>
<s> 3) what are all of the html (or xhtml, or xml) tags that relates to  </s>
<s> languages, fonts, character sets.  </s>
<s> When should I use them?  </s>
<s> How do they  </s>
<s> interact with each other?  </s>
<s> What are some use cases and examples?  </s>
<s> 4) are these tags consistently implemented in the main browsers?  </s>
<s> 5) how do I cope with right-to-left and up-and-down languages?  </s>
<s> 6) how can I ensure that when I transfer my newly-authored web page to  </s>
<s> may server, or when the customer downloads the page, that the encoding  </s>
<s> is not lost?  </s>
<s> 7) how can I maximise the likliehood that the customer viewing my page  </s>
<s> will see the right things?  </s>
<s> 8) how can I represent different languages on the same web page?  </s>
<s> It's probably not a comprehensive list.  </s>
<s> Most sources focus on a subset  </s>
<s> of the elements, whereas the target audiences need to have 'everything  </s>
<s> you need to know about producing multilingual sites' in one place.  </s>
<s> A good opportunity potentially for a book also, I would have thought.  </s>
<s> Save time by using an eTicket and our Self-Service Check-in Kiosks.  </s>

<s> Hi Najib, I'm looking forward to seeing your stuff, and hopefully integrating it into the GEO deliverables.  </s>
<s> You know, it occurs to me that maybe people from areas that use the Arabic script have specific additional questions that we should answer - ie. as we develop GEO materials, do those folks have any special needs/requests?  </s>
<s> The same would apply to Isaac in China, and anyone else who has experience of users in a non-English environment.  </s>

<s> Hi Richard, I share your hope.  </s>
<s> But this will be quite modest in the begining.  </s>
<s> Speaking only for morocco, most web sites are in Frensh, especialy commercial ones for matketing reasons.  </s>
<s> And almost all of the very few moroccan internet users navigate in frensh and a little in english.  </s>
<s> Some News papers (http://www.alalam.ma/),  </s>
<s> portals (http://arabe.casanet.net.ma/ ) or government sites (http://www.justice.gov.ma/ ) offers two (sometimes many) language versions.  </s>
<s> Most of arabic sites uses MS tools to design their pages the same page you find two potions with different encodings (perhaps  </s>
<s> originated from different tools?) and where some texts are in  </s>
<s> unicode numeric entities while other are in window-1256.  </s>
<s> There is an  </s>
<s> accessibility problem here.  </s>
<s> But as more than 95% of PCs use IE, and it is all right, this does not seem to be a "problem"...  </s>
<s> In fact, we still have to do the work of promoting W3C technologies, meet web designers and get feedbacks from people realy working with Arabic.  </s>
<s> Another big "chantier" is accessibility and conformance to standards, not only in Arabic.  </s>
<s> There is a lot to do.  </s>
<s> But the chalange is exciting.  </s>

<s> Hello Najib, Many thanks for your information.  </s>
<s> That would be really, really bad.  </s>
<s> That in and by itself should not be a problem, I guess.  </s>
<s> It would be better if everything was just encoded in a single encoding, but it's not wrong at all.  </s>
