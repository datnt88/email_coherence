FYI. Some user requirements! 
From Nick Gassman at British Airways, who 
I met at the W3C/NIST Usability Workshop last week.

[mailto:nick.1.gassman@britishairways.com] Richard, it was good to meet you again at the workshop. 
You'll recall that I spoke to you about a resource that I felt would be 
useful, and thought I'd put virtual pen to paper to clarify what I was 
talking about. 
It would be great if something like this could appear on 
the W3C site (failing that, if you know of any other site that has the 
information). 
I'll try to send you a separate email with comments on the W3C site as you requested. 
The audience for the languages resoource would range from programmers to 
ecommerce execs who need to understand the components that need to be 
put together to result in a multi-lingual website. 
It would cover the issues end-to-end, including:- 
1) how do I represent different languages and character sets on my PC 
(or Mac etc...), because that's what I'm using to code my site.? 
2) how do languages relate to character sets and fonts. 
How can I tell 
what I've got? 
3) what are all of the html (or xhtml, or xml) tags that relates to 
languages, fonts, character sets. 
When should I use them? 
How do they 
interact with each other? 
What are some use cases and examples? 
4) are these tags consistently implemented in the main browsers? 
5) how do I cope with right-to-left and up-and-down languages? 
6) how can I ensure that when I transfer my newly-authored web page to 
may server, or when the customer downloads the page, that the encoding 
is not lost? 
7) how can I maximise the likliehood that the customer viewing my page 
will see the right things? 
8) how can I represent different languages on the same web page? 
It's probably not a comprehensive list. 
Most sources focus on a subset 
of the elements, whereas the target audiences need to have 'everything 
you need to know about producing multilingual sites' in one place. 
A good opportunity potentially for a book also, I would have thought.

Hello Richard, It is a very good idea. 
I also think of doing something similar for Arabic especially with regard to most of the items enumerrated.

Hi Najib, I'm looking forward to seeing your stuff, and hopefully integrating it into the GEO deliverables. 
You know, it occurs to me that maybe people from areas that use the Arabic script have specific additional questions that we should answer - ie. as we develop GEO materials, do those folks have any special needs/requests? 
The same would apply to Isaac in China, and anyone else who has experience of users in a non-English environment. 
Cheers, RI

Hi Richard, I share your hope. 
But this will be quite modest in the begining. 
Speaking only for morocco, most web sites are in Frensh, especialy commercial ones for matketing reasons. 
And almost all of the very few moroccan internet users navigate in frensh and a little in english. 
Some News papers (http://www.alalam.ma/), 
portals (http://arabe.casanet.net.ma/ ) or government sites (http://www.justice.gov.ma/ ) offers two (sometimes many) language versions. 
Most of arabic sites uses MS tools to design their pages the same page you find two potions with different encodings (perhaps 
originated from different tools?) and where some texts are in 
unicode numeric entities while other are in window-1256. 
There is an 
accessibility problem here. 
But as more than 95% of PCs use IE, and it is all right, this does not seem to be a "problem"... 
In fact, we still have to do the work of promoting W3C technologies, meet web designers and get feedbacks from people realy working with Arabic. 
Another big "chantier" is accessibility and conformance to standards, not only in Arabic. 
There is a lot to do. 
But the chalange is exciting.

Hello Najib, Many thanks for your information. 
That would be really, really bad. 
That in and by itself should not be a problem, I guess. 
It would be better if everything was just encoded in a single encoding, but it's not wrong at all. 
Regards, Martin.
