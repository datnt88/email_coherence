<s> Hi there,  </s>
<s> Is there any freely downloadable Unicode font which contains all, or most of the ideographs defined in ISO10646?  </s>
<s> It doesn't have to be freely redistributable though.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Sam ssun@cnri.reston.va.us  </s>
<s> There is Bitstream Cyberbit, see Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> No (he said confidently) The glyph samples in the Unicode 2.0 book were put together using a large number of fonts.  </s>
<s> If there had been a single font, showing a consistent design style, for all glyphs I am sure they would have used it.  </s>
<s> Even for the unified Han ideographs I think they used more than one font, and it is most unlikely that this font is freely downloadable.  </s>
<s> (I am travelling just now, so can't look at my Unicode 2 book to check).  </s>
<s> Then there are the compatibility ideographs and other miscellanea which most likely used different fonts.  </s>
<s> Also, Unicode/ISO10646 define a coded character set, not a glyph registry; fonts contain glyph representations, not characters.  </s>
<s> So a "complete" ideographic font would have Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and perhaps the old Vietnamese glyph representations for each ideographic character.  </s>
<s> And that is without taking into account basic stylistic variation - Mincho vs Gothic, or even styles for different historical periods.  </s>
<s> Besides, it is not clear that a single font is the best idea - it does odd things to the maximal bounding box which makes solid set type look a little loose, and the font would likely take ages to load.  </s>
