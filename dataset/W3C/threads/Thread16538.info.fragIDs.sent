allows to create PDF "on the fly" to be sent by email to the bureaucrat. 
And everything comes from an accessible HTML form!! 
I don't think the bureacrats want PDF; they want a paper document in a fixed format, which the same format as was used by the person completing the form. 
You can meet the first requirement by printing the captured data onto a pre-printed form, but, if it weren't for the second point, the bureacrat would probably have no problem with a single font printout of the key data and labels. 
In many cases they may also want a signature (some internet banks in the UK take the initial form data online and then print it and send it to the applicant for confirmation and signing). 
PDF just happens to be the best available format for producing a near exact online replica of a document.

Hi Dave, First of all, I disagree with you on your last sentence. 
There are many formats as good, or even better than PDF for printing, including Adobe's own Postscript. 
The reasons why Adobe decided to market PDF so strongly are only known to them, although I am able to think of some. 
Secondly, the discussion was getting to the point where PDF "was almost unavoidable", argument which I strongly disagree. 
I offered to Adam an affordable solution. 
My solution is still valid with your argument, because the "only" thing you need to do is "learn" PDF, and embed the HTML form results in the PDF form. 
In any case, the user does not care about the process because it is server-side. 
Let's not put the burden on the user.
