Resource  Agent  Organization PoliticalOrganization  TerroristOrganization ...lists 7 organisations as "Terrorist" without giving any definition for this notoriously emotive and controversial concept. 
This worries me, particularly as this random selection of violence-tinged organisations (there are 1000s more) is somewhat weighted towards groups in support of largely Islamic populations or causes. 
I would be a lot happier with TAP if you could expose (even just in prose/html) the definitional guidelines you're using to populate these bits of the KB. 
The single word 'terrorist' does really clarify things. 
Sadly, many groups try to get their way by using violence, and by using violence in ways that kill, wound or distress civilian populations. 
This much is widely known, and widely regretted. 
The word 'terrorist' is often used to characterise some such groups; frequently it competes with terms that suggest approval, such as 'freedom fighter'. 
I could dig out examples (Nicaragua, Afghanistan, etc.) but the point is a well known one, and not particularly subtle. 
One person's Terrorist is another's Freedom Fighter, as they say. 
It might be more neutral if TAP instead simply indicated whether the groups currently or formerly are seen (by TAP) as using violence against civilians to achieve their ends. 
Thinking about it, my preferred design would try to reflect in some of the controversy, eg. by making the concept of terrorist explicitly relational rather than absolute. 
For eg., Hamas is denouncedAsTerroristBy USGovt (and vice-versa, no doubt); IRA by UKGovt, etc. 
The current TAP treatment also fails to address subtleties of changes over time. 
It doesn't distinguish between groups that are all-out violent against civilians, groups that profess to avoid civilian suffering (but maybe don't try hard enough), and those that have various forms of association (breakaway groups, rogue elements, etc) with groups and individuals that are more inclined towards brutality than those currently dominant within the larger group. 
TAP's inclusion of the PLO is a good example of the lack of subtlety here, both w.r.t. the way that the PLO has evolved over the years, and regarding the complex ecology of competing groups, views, sub-groups that make up such organizations. 
On the specifics of this case see http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/ngo/history.html and for further details (eg. 
on UN's award of Observer Status to the PLO). 
My point though isn't to argue the specifics of claims that are in TAP, but to suggest that TAP might see wider adoption if the KB editors tried to structure things so that the claims and worldview embodied in TAP are neutral and uncontroversial wherever possible. 
I think, even in the case of terrorism, this is achievable, by modeling the controversy (as sketched above). 
There is no real need for TAP, TAP's editors, or its publishers (Stanford University?) to say "Organizations X, Y and Z are 'Terrorist Organizations'", when it could instead say, with less controversy, "Party X denounces Organization Y as terroristic". 
This has two key benefits. 
Firstly it makes TAP more widely adoptable by pushing controversy down into reported content, secondly it allows the basic structure of (certain kinds of) controversy to be modeled and used in applications. 
Maybe I've said the same thing twice. 
There are two ideas closely tangled up: being uncontroversial isn't the same thing as being bland, uninformative. 
Moving to a relational approach to capturing the information re terrorism would I believe make TAP more informative. 
cheers, Dan 
There are in fact a lot more: 
That download script is broken. 
The link above goes to newer versions of the KB browser, but it's a static page (the last time I posted a link to a development server, it took me three months to stop Yahoo Slurp from crawling it despite robots.txt 
saying to get lost). 
The source of the data is not currently document in TAP, but it's the State Department's Patterns of Global Terrorism 2002. 
I think the 7 that show up on tap.stanford.edu 
were put in during 2001 by hand, probably from the same "patterns" source. 
These sorts of problems are heavily worked on in TAP, the best paper to read about it is this one: It's called "Semantic Issues in Web Scale Knowledge Aggregation" and it details many of these sorts of issues, including the two you mention, the problem of point of view and the problem of time. 
A more detailed paper describing first steps toward solving these troubles during aggregation is here: 
The second point you make, about contributions to TAP, I'm not sure is so simple. 
I'm not convinced that lots of people were considering contributing data until they were offended by a simplistic categorization of their favorite group or person. 
That being said, the Wikipedia model seems to be rather 
effective in this area, describing contentious issues in a way such that controversy is embraced and expressed, and I think more could be done both to stay away from the sorts of problems described in the "issues" paper, and to stay away from honking people off.

Lots more. 
Thanks for sharing the new version. 
I like that the new version exposes the source of the claims. 
Very neat. 
I'd still be interested to see a definition (just plain old prose, not FOL/OWL etc) for this class. 
Ah, that explains the slant. 
They're in the news today btw: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has acknowledged that a recent government report on global terrorism contains errors and will be corrected. 
The report, called "Patterns of Global Terrorism," concluded that in 2003 the number of terrorism attacks worldwide was at its lowest point in 34 years. 
Bush Administration officials had offered the finding as proof the war on terror was going well. 
The finding however was criticized by academics and intelligence analysts, who said a number of terrorist attacks were omitted, including attacks in Turkey and Chechnya that claimed several hundred lives. 
Mr. Powell denied accusations that the data had been manipulated for political gain. 
The secretary said mistakes by a new terrorism data collection office contributed to an undercount of attacks. 
Ah, right. 
Looks interesting, I think I saw this or a draft before from Guha. 
I'll have a closer look... 
Ah that was the one I saw. 
Will re-read. 
I was thinking at a different granularity. 
It's more than people like me who have other RDF vocabs that TAP could fit nicely into might be warier of endorsing its usage (in tools and software) if it appears to have too much stuff scraped from dodgy US govt sources. 
In particular, a lot of Europeans are particularly sensitive about such things in the last year or so. 
TAP's got a reasonably good chance of being the first big and cross-domain instance-oriented RDF data source that people start to base things around. 
But the more controversial pieces there are, the harder it is to claim TAP as a common base for everyone to build on. 
Yep, Wikipedia seems to be doing pretty well on this front. 
BTW re collaborative data production, have you seen MusicBrainz? 
The project seems to be maturing nicely. 
They have RDF-friendly data model and Web service interfaces, and CD/Album/etc track listings for a lot of artists, as well as TRM digital fingerprints of audio recordings. 
and protocol detail (HTTP-based). 
Some data dumps can be found in ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz 
although I can't connect right now. 
I wonder what the overlap is between TAP and MB... Dan
