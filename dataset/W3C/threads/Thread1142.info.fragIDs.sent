Hi, I am very new to tidy and have just been testing tidy on our web site. 
I have it working just fine with files using the test command "./tidy -clean --word-2000 yes wordhtml.htm" 
Now what I really want to do, is provide tidy with a string of html (from posting an html form) instead of "wordhtml.htm". 
I was going to do this with the PHP extension http://pecl.php.net/package/tidy but my hosting provider won't install it. 
So I've been trying to do this from the command line, but I can't figure out how to do this. 
Thanks for any help... Jo 
Just curious - - a while back, I attempted to create a config file so that Tidy would recognized ASP.Net Server controls and not break everytime it saw one - - I was never successful - - 
Was any more effort put into this area of Tidy?

takes a different approach to use Tidy in ASP.NET and will clean the output of web controls rather than their source which sounds more reasonable to me.
