<s> Season's Greetings to the WAI list.  </s>
<s> I've put together a presentation for web folks here at Stanford to let them  </s>
<s> know of the resources available for ensuring accessibility.  </s>
<s> However, I wanted to quote some numbers to make the issue more real.  </s>
<s> I have tried to find some data on the web about visual impairment in the population and have been unsuccessful.  </s>
<s> Anyone know of a source, or have the data themselves?  </s>
<s> I'm looking for things like: % of internet users with visual impairment % of population (US) with visual impairment (those requiring aids more significant than glasses) % of world population with v.i. etc.  </s>
<s> Also, I thought I heard Greg Vanderheiden quote some future statistics about the aging population and that larger percentages will be apparent as the baby boomer ages - any ideas about that?  </s>
<s> Thanks for any assistance.  </s>

<s> I'd like to have some stats which say something like: You have a 75% of being dependent upon assistive technology to access the web, at least temporarily, sometime in the next 20 years.  </s>
<s> My thinking on this issue intensified when I broke my arm and found myself unable to use my computer effectively.  </s>
<s> :) In other words, nobody really wants to hear "hey, you're gonna go blind when you get old", but it's easier to convince them, "you may suffer from RSI or broken bones or eyestrain, and thus will need this yourself someday" -- if we include temporarily disabled people in the mix, we find there's an even LARGER audience of folks who will, at one time or another, benefit from accessible web design.  </s>

<s> When doing the presentation, have you considered mentioning that some of the most important vistors to a web site are effectively blind?  </s>
<s> The various robots from search engines need accessible sites to be able to index them.  </s>
<s> Fun for the day, do a search on "you need a better browser" in altavista to have a brief look at some sites that have not considered their search engine profile at all.  </s>

<s> About 18 months ago, in an old job, I did a little test to find out about use of images.  </s>
<s> We had a new front page, new image, new names, and after a week I did a quick check of the server access logs and some basic arithmetic. the results were as follows: hits on page: about 100 000 GET image requests: about 45 000 some users from the organisation (an unmeasurable quantity, but perhaps about half) were restricted to text only access.  </s>
<s> So I checked for identifiable requests from inside the organisation: 45 000 Assuming that all of those were text-only access, which is a bad assumption, then 10% of outside hits did not bother to take the image.  </s>
<s> This was one of Australia's largest websites, but had been recently rated as one of the least interesting unless you really wanted the information (as distinct to an exciting and visually stimulating browsing experience) It also counted hits to the server, so proxy servers only counted as one hit.  </s>
<s> I concluded that a substantial proportion of people accessing the fron page were not visually impaired, but were just not interested in the images - after all one of the most common efficieny tricks, and generally the most effective, since it cuts most download times by 25% - 95%, is to turn images off.  </s>

<s> This calls to mind a good trick to play on those people who will quote you 98% usage by Netscape/Microsoft users.  </s>
<s> "How many of those people using MSIE or Navigator are blind, and are using screen readers?  </s>
<s> What, you don't _know_?" "How many of those people using MSIE or Navigator have their image loading turned off?  </s>
<s> What, you don't _know_?"  </s>
<s> Heh.  </s>
<s> I suck.  </s>

<s> Woah, higher numbers than I expected -- 8% of respondents said they are disabled/impaired in some way.  </s>
<s> Nice number to throw at folks who insist they don't care about "the 0.1% who use lynx".  </s>

<s> I couldn't see them, I surf with images off.  </s>
