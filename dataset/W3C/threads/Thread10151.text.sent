AGENDA: TRANSCRIPT: 1: Scribes Today: Jeremy Carroll Next week: Jan Grant Week after: Jos De Roo (all volunteers!) 2: Roll Call Present: FrankM, GrahamK, Bwm, Jos, SteveP, PatrickS (muted), EricM, PatH, Mike_Dean DaveB, Jeremy, Jan_g, Guha, Aaron, DanC, DanBri, Regrets: Sergey (Brian holds proxy vote) 3: Review Agenda DanC noted that some outstanding actions have not been listed on the agenda; specificially those to do with rdf:datatype. 
4: Next telecon 18th Oct 2002 5: Minutes of 2002-10-04 telecon Sparse but approved. 
6. Semantics of untyped Literals - reviewing most recent information Information reviewed see: webont results pat's possible untidy route implementations of option F PatH withdraw proposal after it was suggested that it was complex. 
Discussion of merging options C and F, did not receive much support. 
7: Semantics of untyped Literals - Picking the most promising option The options: The chair removed option D unopposed. 
The chair removed option B unopposed (but DanC was 'unhappy'). 
(The chair noted that B/C was pretty even within the working group, but the webont feedback on option B was compelling). 
The chair noted that strongest support and least dissent was for option C. The chair confirmed that the changed Nokia vote was taken into account in that judgement (cf: The chair noted that without an agreement the WG lacked sufficient consensus to publish a further Model Theory WD. Mike Dean noted that in this situation he would oppose C. He hoped that it might be possible to ask both questions (C and F). 8: Semantics of untyped Literals - reviewing the question C: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0098.html (Note: technically this agendum was merged with item 7 during the course of the meeting). 
Aaron was unhappy with the additions, many of the rest of the WG spoke in support of the additions. 
Aaron agreed that he could vote for option C (even with the additions) as long as it was noted that he maintained his opposition to some aspects of the additions as a comment. 
9: Semantics of untyped Literals - putting the question DECISION: Untyped literals: The resolution of msg 0098 with all options, and fix from GK. Vote: 11-2 Against: Mike Dean Nokia For: ILRT Graham Klyne Agfa IBM Pat Hayes W3C Guha HP HWG Sergey Melnik (cast by proxy Concur: MITRE ACTION: jang - add test cases from msg Oct/0098 ACTION: daveb - make changes to ntriple reflecting rdf:datatype ACTION: jjc - circulate new version of concepts doc ACTION: daveb - circulate new version of syntax doc, (ready to publish?) (In the excitement, a comment from Aaron on his vote was not recorded: the scribe suggests an e-mail response to this message). 
Rest of agenda not reached, but: Graham noted that agenda item 12 is passed it's sell by date. 
10: possible semantic bugs concerning domain and range 11: Proposed technical changes to RDFS model theory 12: Frank's new assertion text I believe what we "officially" decided about item 12 was that it would be considered as a comment directed to the Concepts document (and hence to be considered by the Editors) rather than continuing to be an item of WG business. 
semiSeriousThreat If all we've decided is that its sell by date is passed, or some such administrivia, in order to ignore it, I'll be happy to provide a "fresh" version by raising it again.

I believe Graham and I have taken your text into account, but wouldn't be surprised if you feel a need to reraise it when we review the next version of the concepts doc. 
Jeremy I think the issue here is that it fell foul of the multiple property problem, i.e. one could have two properties where there should only be one.
