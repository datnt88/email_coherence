Thanks, Daniel for encouraging further translations, now the list has 27 languages. 
I wonder how many cards have been distributed all-together. 
The currently most recent 2001/01 text is available from I note that the graphic reference versions of the quick tips in both sizes are the 1999/08 versions, rather than the one we revised in 2001/01. 
"Two versions of the Quick Tips card are available for reference: ?

An image (a .gif file) showing how the Quick Tips appear when laid out on a business card (small size/print, August 1999 version).

A bigger image (another .gif file)showing how the Quick Tips business card layout look like (but less accurate) " I hope those were not the reference basis for any of the now 27 translations!

Hello Harvey and EO folks. 
In the order of 5000 per language in Europe (for the 10 major ones). 
For the English version, I think it's more in the order of 100000 (Judy has the exact count). 
No, of course. 
We always use the English inline. 
I removed the second gif which doesn't correspond to anything real graphically speaking (it's was just the first mockup I'd done years ago in ps I think, but never printed like that). 
And I'll try to scan a more recent one (and with a better resolution too) soon. 
I made a couple of other changes: the link "Translations" at the top goes directly to the translations page, instead of to the middle of the How to order section (always found that confusing). 
I removed the Sample section which had just one gif now and put the link to the card gif inline (but I kept the anchor for linking reference from outside). 
Please have a look at the page, I think it's leanier and easier to use now. 
Harvey I'm the one who works with the printer who produced the samples for us. 
I'll check -- the printer may have sent us updated samples but they just didn't get posted. 
Otherwise we can get new ones. 
Daniel's been very careful to coordinate the translations to the most recent versions of the actual Quick Tips text, so I don't think that's a concern. 
Thanks for noting this, - Judy
