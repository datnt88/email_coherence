<s> Thanks, Daniel for encouraging further translations, now the list has 27 languages.  </s>
<s> I wonder how many cards have been distributed all-together.  </s>
<s> The currently most recent 2001/01 text is available from I note that the graphic reference versions of the quick tips in both sizes are the 1999/08 versions, rather than the one we revised in 2001/01.  </s>
<s> "Two versions of the Quick Tips card are available for reference: ?  </s>

<s> An image (a .gif file) showing how the Quick Tips appear when laid out on a business card (small size/print, August 1999 version).  </s>

<s> A bigger image (another .gif file)showing how the Quick Tips business card layout look like (but less accurate) " I hope those were not the reference basis for any of the now 27 translations!  </s>

<s> Hello Harvey and EO folks.  </s>
<s> In the order of 5000 per language in Europe (for the 10 major ones).  </s>
<s> For the English version, I think it's more in the order of 100000 (Judy has the exact count).  </s>
<s> No, of course.  </s>
<s> We always use the English inline.  </s>
<s> I removed the second gif which doesn't correspond to anything real graphically speaking (it's was just the first mockup I'd done years ago in ps I think, but never printed like that).  </s>
<s> And I'll try to scan a more recent one (and with a better resolution too) soon.  </s>
<s> I made a couple of other changes: the link "Translations" at the top goes directly to the translations page, instead of to the middle of the How to order section (always found that confusing).  </s>
<s> I removed the Sample section which had just one gif now and put the link to the card gif inline (but I kept the anchor for linking reference from outside).  </s>
<s> Please have a look at the page, I think it's leanier and easier to use now.  </s>
<s> Harvey I'm the one who works with the printer who produced the samples for us.  </s>
<s> I'll check -- the printer may have sent us updated samples but they just didn't get posted.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we can get new ones.  </s>
<s> Daniel's been very careful to coordinate the translations to the most recent versions of the actual Quick Tips text, so I don't think that's a concern.  </s>
<s> Thanks for noting this, - Judy  </s>
