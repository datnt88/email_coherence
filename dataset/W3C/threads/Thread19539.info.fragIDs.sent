<s> Hi! First of all, congratulations to your 0.8c release of Amaya.  </s>
<s> At first sight, everything looks *really* nice!  </s>
<s> There are two points I want to turn your attention to: 1.  </s>
<s> I'm desparately seeking a browser that correctly displays transparent, 1-bit grayscale PNGs.  </s>
<s> I have black&amp;white PNGs and want to have the white color transparent (I create them with pnmtopng -transparent #ffffff img.pbm  img.png)  </s>
<s> The result when viewed with Amaya as inlined IMGs is as follows: If I omit the -transparent flag, the image gets displayed o.k., i.e. *black* characters on *white* background.  </s>
<s> If I say -transparent #ffffff, then *grey* characters appear on *white* background (rectangular box).  </s>
<s> If I say -transparent #000000, then *light grey* characters appear on *white* background.  </s>
<s> I'd be **most** grateful if you could give me some pointers about what is wrong here.  </s>
<s> BTW, I'm running a Linux box with libpng-0.89c,  </s>
<s> zlib-1.0.4 and pnmtopng-2.31.  </s>
<s> Thank you for looking into this.  </s>
<s> 2. (only a minor thing) Doesn't Amaya have a `Reload' Button?  </s>
<s> Kind regards Marek PS. Please CC your reply to marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de;  </s>

<s> Hello Irene,  </s>
<s> Certainly: http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~marek/ttt/ttt.html  </s>
<s> This contains a simple testpage with two inlined PNGs, both of them transparent, 1-bit grayscale.  </s>
<s> For comparison there's a ttt2.html in  </s>
<s> the same directory, too, that is using GIFs instead of PNGs.  </s>
<s> Thank you for taking your time looking at this problem.  </s>

<s> Well, there is a bug somewhere.  </s>
<s> Did you try to change the background color of the whole document body?  </s>
<s> When doing that, the background of your images stay white and the foreground takes the same color as the document background.  </s>
<s> Are you sure that the *background* of your PNGs is transparent?  </s>
<s> It seems that it is the *forground* that is transparent.  </s>

<s> Vincent, (and others)  </s>
<s> thanks for having a look at this, I really appreciate your help.  </s>
<s> I thought of this point, too.  </s>
<s> My images are generated by pnmtopng from a black&amp;white pbm (Portable Bit Map, only two colors).  </s>
<s> I tried both pnmtopng -transparent #ffffff img1.pnm  img1.png (this is supposed to have the effect I want - black characters on the browser's background) and pnmtopng -transparent #000000 img1.pnm  img1.png  </s>
<s> The behaviour was *almost* the same: The *white* image background is visible in both cases, but the color of the characters is *grey* in the first case and *light grey* in the second.  </s>
<s> I've prepared another test page, here are the URLs:  </s>
<s> - This is the document with PNGs with -transparent #ffffff.  </s>
<s> This should be the one that works in the end, given that everything is ok with libpng-0.89c,  </s>
<s> libz-1.0.4 and pnmtopng-2.31 - This is the version using transparent GIFs instead of PNGs - works ok with netscape and other browsers.  </s>
<s> - This is the same as the first URL, but with -transparent #000000 to show the effect mentioned above.  </s>
<s> You can also retrieve the original PNMs from (actually these two are PBMs, i.e. 1-bit image data) Thank you again for your cooperation, I'll be happy to contribute to the development of the *first* linux browser with proper PNG support!  </s>
<s> Best regards Marek PS.  </s>
<s> I haven't tried multicolor, transparent PNGs yet.  </s>
<s> Hopefully I'll find some time to do that, perhaps it will bring us closer to the root of this problem.  </s>

<s> hi,  </s>
<s> the PNGs are ok, at least my netscape/linux png-plugin shows them as transparent (both img1 and img2) .. but not as IMG.. cause that's a problem of the plugin-tech :( i've to load them directly.. cu rasca  </s>
