I've been thinking a bit about a schedule to completion. 
We are aiming to be done by March. 
Basic Plan: Get a new set of WD's out with all technical content by 8/Nov Get last call docs out 13/Dec Last call closes 24/Jan 25/Oct Concepts Doc ready for Review Syntax Doc ready for Review 01/Nov Agree to publish concepts doc and and syntax doc Primer ready for review Schema ready for review Model theory ready for review Test cases ready for review 08/Nov Agree to publish Primer, Schema, MT and Test cases concepts doc and syntax doc published 15/Nov at the latest - Primer, Schema, MT and Test cases published **Note there is a publishing moratorium from 18/Nov to 29/Nov so we can't afford to miss this. 
06/Dec Last call docs ready for WG review 13/Dec Decision to publish last call docs **Note: Need to check if this will run into another Moratorium 17/Jan Last call period ends More detail is needed on getting through candidate rec. 
However, we have to start working on now on defining and meeting cr criteria to keep, not wait till last call. 
Brian I've been working on and I'm happy with it so far. 
There are now examples for most all RDF/XML parts. 
I'm a bit tired to continue it today but should have no problem finishing it tomorrow for reviewers to start looking at. 
The list of things to do: status section - return of about/rdf:about if it happens section 2 - add anchors for new headers section 2 - add example of property attributes on an empty property element section 8 serializing - cut down and junk somewhat now we have rdf:nodeID appendix B - make RELAX NG up-to-date The rest is the usual w3c document publishing stuff which happens later on when we actually go. 
Dave Oh, hell, I thought I had to have it written by the 8th, not the 1st. 
I may have trouble being ready by the 1st.

Well, that's good to know sooner rather than later so we can rejigger the plan or something.
