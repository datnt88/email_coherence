The port 8001 version seems fine.

Ditto, but when I posted that, it wouldn't respond even to "telnet localhost 80", just timed out. 
By the way, now the 8001 version is refusing connections: 
ville@lovejoy:~$ telnet localhost 8001 Trying 127.0.0.1... telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused 
restarted.
