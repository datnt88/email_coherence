Hi Apologies if there is an obvious answer to this, but I havent been able to locate it via browsing, searching or asking yet: is there a working group, standard, best practice or even published proprietary API for deploying an ontology via Web Services. 
I am interested in the case of a community managed ontology, where working groups can be delegated to maintain parts of the ontology, all via a single web accessible repository. 
Applications would be able to search this repository as required. 
I would like the ability to: 
1) insert, update or delete classes 
2) find references that directly depend on a class 
3) query 
4) ideally, insert an entire OWL ontology including relationships to pre-existing classes... 
5) ... which implies having a stable URI to reference items within the deployed ontology in the first place 
Maybe there is no API that makes sense, and its always only possible to think about publishing a single file, and using xlink to try to glue it all together - in which case there should be some serious thought somewhere about the query mechanisms you would use to perform typical ontology traversals. 
I'd be happy with a registry-friendly model where the transactions can be defined to be honest. 
Can anyone point me to where such deployment issues are being worked out?

Rob, you might want to take a look at the work of the EU project Wonderweb.. http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org/ 
They might have some tools that are moving in the direction you are seeking.

Hi Rob, Two tools might be interesting for you: * the Sesame ontology store and query engine (available as a WS), see: * the WebOde - a web based ontology editor which offers support for multiple users, see: http://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/webODE/.

Rob -- You may be interested in the Internet Business Logic system for this. 
It's live, online at www.reengineeringllc.com . 
The author- and user-interface is a browser. 
Several people can point their browsers to one ontology, and cooperatively edit it (with locking). 
If one person has the ontology locked for changes, others can run, the prior unchanged version. 
The notation is closer to English than OWL, supported by a heavyweight inference engine. 
Your points 1-5 below are supported, though 4 might need a bit more work. 
A good example to start with is RDFQueryLangComparison1 . 
HTH. Thanks in advance for comments.

I would like to call your attention to the work that is currently being done in the OASIS/ebXML Registry SCM (Semantic Content Management) subcommittee [1]. 
A link to the group's charter is also listed in [1]. 
I've copied the SCM listserv in case any of the members that are on this list would like to provide more information.

Sounds like a job for the Web! 8-) 
HTTP POST. 
More than likely, HTTP PUT. 
HTTP DELETE.

Sounds right.

The closest is the DIG interface. 
Yes. 
It depends on what you mean. 
You can add to a class expression, or to the axioms. 
But there is no deletion. 
I don't know what this means. 
At least a standard set of DL queries. 
Yes. 
I don't understand this. 
The DIG interface is incomplete, but it is implemented and deployed (see the oiled and protege editors for some examples). 
Our group raised some of this as a requirement for the Data Access Working Group (DA-WG): 0286.html 
Our reasoner, Pellet, also supporst some of this in a fairly crude, GET oriented sort of way: We are working on a solution based on XPointer that would give you some useful URIs for parts of the ontology. 
Not a lot of this is trivial, or even straightforward, unless you are really working against something like the XML of a document. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia. 
This is the goal of the Open Source RDF/RDFS/OWL editor "pOWL" - it is currently under heavy development. 
Maybe you would like to check the website at: An interactive demo is provided, but pOWL lacks an exhaustive documentation. 
Please use the mailinglist and forums at the SourceForge project page and feel free to add feature requests at the tracker. 
Most of the things you mentioned are already implemented, nevertheless pOWL ist still of late alpha / early beta quality. 
A first stable version is planned for August, please subscribe to the powl-releases mailinglist at sourceforge (http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/powl-releases) 
to stay informed.
