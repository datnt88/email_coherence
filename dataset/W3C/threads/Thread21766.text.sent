I read in: that "Before advancing a technical report to Last Call Working Draft, the Working Group must: formally address all issues raised by Working Group participants, other Working Groups, the Membership, and the public about the Working Draft. 
" I note that I raised an issue rdf compatibility in the message: I understand "formally address" to mean: "In the context of this document, a Working Group has formally addressed an issue when the Chair can show (archived) evidence of having sent a response to the party who raised the issue. 
This response should include the Working Group's resolution and should ask the party who raised the issue to reply with an indication of whether the resolution reverses the initial objection." 
I hence ask for a response to my message raising the issue. 
Just asking for an issue doesn't make it one. 
The WG has agreed that the chairs get to decide what's an issue and what's not. 
Er.. oops, no, that's actually not the case. 
The chairs just get to decide when to open issues. 
hmm... "Issues are submitted by members of the working group. 
Such issues are marked raised. 
The process for submission is described above. 
* The chair may open an issue, normally assigning an owner." -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html 
Jim, you/we need to go back over all the issue requests we didn't act on and get them added to the issues list. 
Sigh.

I am only concerned about process: + to the extent that there is inadequate discussion of the issues/issuettes; + and should I need to formally object A test case is that the following document is in OWL Lite. 
rdf:Bag rdf:type owl:Class . 
rdf:_1 rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty . 
eg:a rdf:type rdf:Bag . 
eg:a rdf:_1 eg:b . 
eg:b rdf:type owl:Thing . 
I am currently dissatisfied with the chair ruling that the RDF compatibility stuff is an attempt to reopen the OWL Lite discussion - it isn't. 
If it were, I do not believe the Bristol decision on issue 5.2 had anything to do with the use of RDF non-logical vocabulary items within OWL Lite. 
However I can imagine a response from the chair to which I would indicate that I was happy. 
That response is that the decision on 5.2 endorsed OWL Lite also including the RDF vocabulary permitted by the previously published abstract syntax document: viz the following are excluded: rdf:type, rdf:Property, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, owl:Class, owl:sameClassAs, owl:DisjointWith, owl:oneOf, owl:unionOf, owl:intersectionOf, owl:complementOf, owl:samePropertyAs, owl:inverseOf, owl:DatatypeProperty, owl:ObjectProperty, owl:SymmetricProperty, owl:UniqueProperty, owl:UnambiguousProperty, owl:TransitiveProperty, owl:Restriction, owl:onProperty, owl:toClass, owl:hasClass, owl:hasValue, owl:minCardinality, owl:maxCardinality, owl:cardinality, owl:sameIndividualAs, owl:differentIndividualFrom, owl:List, owl:first, owl:rest, owl:nil. 
rather than the wholesale exclusion found in the last published AS&amp;S and the current editor's S&amp;AS - an exclusion that does not seem to reflect any WG decision. 
I have no need at this time to have the annotations issue added to the issue list, since I believe we are all but done on it; and similarly I currently expect an adequate resolution of the xml:lang and rdf:XMLLiteral issuette.
