I was asking Jim Hendler why it seemed like the WebOnt use cases were so much easier to put together (do we just suppress upleasant memories, or what?) and he reminded me of a format that seemed to help. 
I just managed to look it up: use-case format Guus Schreiber (Friday, 30 November) We might be past brainstorming stage where that structure is most useful; it wasn't carried thru to the eventual publication of the requirements document 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
Dan, Not having been involved on WebOnt, I can only guess, but the community from which WebOnt members came, has, at its core, a set of people who had a common language and understanding (not necessary agreement!) from previous work. 
The community from which DAWG members is more diverse. 
Now we are moving to a working draft, I would expect that we can make rapid progress as there is something concrete and bounded to comment on. 
I would be inclined to go with the structure that the editor already has, although adding the "Goals" section could be useful, but not to delay a published draft. 
I read the goals section of the WebOnt document as stating good principles (and clarification with repesect to RDFS) which can be hard to pin down in a single use case, but things that have emerged from practice. 
For DAWG, that is not so much specific query/protocol items as general design - som eis already captured in our requirments (e.g. "Queries expressible in a syntax that is easily read and written by people.") 
In section 2, it says: The requirements were chosen based on the aspects of the use cases that the working group considered most important, while considering the scope of the OWL charter and other design constraints. 
As such, one should not assume that OWL will directly support every aspect of the use cases. 
and the last sentence makes a good point. 
The work we do enables, not completely solves, the usecases.

Yes, and that makes me nervous for other reasons, as well. 
But -shrug-, I guess. 
This week I'm reading and thinking about as many Use Case and Requirements documents as I can find from W3C working groups. 
I like OWL's a lot. 
It may be that I can convert my 'benefits' stuff into something like its Design Goals (and, *perhaps*, move the less well supported tech requirements into an Objectives section -- I think Dan mentioned something like in Leiden -- especially if the chair suggests some kind of ranking based on our straw polling, but even if not I'll try to do some of that). 
Anyway, having precedents is very helpful to me in editing. 
So thanks. 
Ah, yes, I'm agreeing with this suggestion, Andy. 
Yes, again. 
It may make sense to have language just like that in our doc.
