ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Two of the participated in todays AU meeting; Microsoft (Chuck Oppermane) and SoftQuad (Lauren Wood). 
- Mike Here is the partial list of authoring tool developers we were targeting. 
The actual list of developer is probably over 200, these are a reflection of the market share results as of December 97. Please suggest any additions.
