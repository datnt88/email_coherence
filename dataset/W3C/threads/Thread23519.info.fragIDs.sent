<s> Clement, We have done some more experimenting with your excellent www4mail program at the National Library of Medicine in the United States.  </s>
<s> We had problems making it work with our searchable PubMed database until we commented out one line in the code.  </s>
<s> In the tag_strip subroutine you have two lines as follows: #Convert = to space $newpart =~ s/\=/&amp;\#32/g;  </s>
<s> You are converting '=' to an HTML space.  </s>
<s> You also convert some other characters to space.  </s>
<s> Converting '=' to ' ' does not seem to work with our pages.  </s>
<s> So I commented that line out, and then everything worked.  </s>
<s> However, before  </s>
<s> we make this change permanent, I thought that I should tell you about it and ask if you think this will break something else.  </s>
<s> If you would like to try searching our database, start with: If you would like to try using our copy of the www4mail server, you can reach it at www4mail@spine.nlm.nih.gov.  </s>
<s> We have configured the server using .allow and .deny to only search pages at the National Library of Medicine.  </s>
<s> This server is not yet available to the public, so please do not broadcast its presence yet.  </s>
<s> Thank you again for your fine program.  </s>
<s> Regards, Alan Meyer Alan Meyer AM Systems Randallstown, MD U.S.A.  </s>
<s> Hi Alan!  </s>
<s> I was just trying to figure out, what seems to be answered by your remark more generally, thank you.  </s>
<s> btw: good news to hear from www4mail at NLM XFORM field: '='-signs in URL are replaced by blanks: example: XFORM=FORM ACTION http://www.deja.com/  </s>
<s> dnt_nm/[ST_rn ap]/rate/dnquery.xp  </s>
<s> \\ XBASE = http://www.deja.com/=dnt_nm/[ST_rn=ap]/  </s>
<s> XBASE field displays correct path.  </s>

<s> Hi Alan, I believe that some of these perl code to change things were high handed!  </s>
<s> Looking at it now and looking at the reply from Thomas, I can easily understand the problem!  </s>
<s> Probably, I would need a few days to look into the code and find out the implications!  </s>
<s> or place a permanent fix on it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for looking into the code!  </s>
