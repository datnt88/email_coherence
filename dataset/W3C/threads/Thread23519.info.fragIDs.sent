Clement, We have done some more experimenting with your excellent www4mail program at the National Library of Medicine in the United States. 
We had problems making it work with our searchable PubMed database until we commented out one line in the code. 
In the tag_strip subroutine you have two lines as follows: #Convert = to space $newpart =~ s/\=/&amp;\#32/g; 
You are converting '=' to an HTML space. 
You also convert some other characters to space. 
Converting '=' to ' ' does not seem to work with our pages. 
So I commented that line out, and then everything worked. 
However, before 
we make this change permanent, I thought that I should tell you about it and ask if you think this will break something else. 
If you would like to try searching our database, start with: If you would like to try using our copy of the www4mail server, you can reach it at www4mail@spine.nlm.nih.gov. 
We have configured the server using .allow and .deny to only search pages at the National Library of Medicine. 
This server is not yet available to the public, so please do not broadcast its presence yet. 
Thank you again for your fine program.

Hi Alan! 
I was just trying to figure out, what seems to be answered by your remark more generally, thank you. 
btw: good news to hear from www4mail at NLM XFORM field: '='-signs in URL are replaced by blanks: example: XFORM=FORM ACTION http://www.deja.com/ 
dnt_nm/[ST_rn ap]/rate/dnquery.xp 
\\ XBASE = http://www.deja.com/=dnt_nm/[ST_rn=ap]/ 
XBASE field displays correct path.

Hi Alan, I believe that some of these perl code to change things were high handed! 
Looking at it now and looking at the reply from Thomas, I can easily understand the problem! 
Probably, I would need a few days to look into the code and find out the implications! 
or place a permanent fix on it. 
Thanks for looking into the code!
