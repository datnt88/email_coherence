Dear Ugo and others, Sorry I have been a bit distracted with other matters, but would like to pick this up again now. 
Thank you for your observations in this mail and the previous ones. 
But the obvious question is: Why? 
In this case when we are interested in only a high level, arm waving sort of description what is it that a WSDL description brings that is required? 
I think this question definitely applies to WS-Choreography and possibly to BPEL as well (though generally that is aimed at a lower level) - so I might see if it is an issue on the BPEL list. 
Note again that the question in my mind is whether a set of WSDL descriptions always needs to accompany a WS-Choreography description - they certainly will for a detailed level choreography description, but they seem to be too much detail (and will add many lines) when focussing on just the basic allowed message sequences.

&amp; tony_fletcher@btopenworld.com) description Tony, Your quote of the BPEL spec talks about variable references that can be omitted. 
But that is separate from using WSDL descriptions. 
In particular, those invoke/ , receive/ , and reply/ activities would still need a portType reference, even in cases where the variable reference attributes had been dropped. 
Ugo -----Original Message----- On Behalf Of Tony Fletcher description Dear Ugo and others, Well, if that is the case then that is a problem for BPEL that should perhaps be taken up on their list (there are a number of open issues on abstract processes). 
If the WS-Choreography group can agree to provide a one document description of any choreography between two or more parties that is as simple as possible when all that is required is a 'high level' description of the choreography, then that will be a big 'selling' point for WS-Choreography IMHO. 
[However, I would question what you say as Section 15.1 of the BPEL spec (Nov 03) states: In many cases, the level of abstraction appropriate in abstract processes makes it unnecessary to use message variables in web service interaction activities, when the intent is to simply constrain the sequencing of such activities, and the actual message data is not relevant. 
To simplify these common cases it is permissible, in abstract processes, to omit the variable reference attributes from the invoke/ , receive/ , and reply/ activities. 
If you can enlighten me further I would appreciate it, but perhaps directly to me and not on this list unless you feel the points are relevant to the WS-Choreography group Thank you] Best Regards Tony A M Fletcher Home: 35, Wimborne Avenue, IPSWICH IP3 8QW amfletcher@iee.org

&amp; tony_fletcher@btopenworld.com) -----Original Message----- description Tony, I am fairly sure that abstract BPEL does not demand WSDL descriptions. 
Actually it does. 
Most of the BPEL spec applies both to executable and abstract processes. 
The differences for the case of abstract processes are detailed in sec. 
15 and only relate to the way variables and assignments are defined. 
Ugo -----Original Message----- On Behalf Of Tony Fletcher description Dear Colleagues, Following on from the teleconference on 13 April 2004, I would like to emphasise that I consider this issue still open, and not closed by the discussion at the recent face to face. 
I do recognise the need to make forward progress - I have been critical of our slowness in the past and believe it is one of the factors in our loss of numbers over time. 
I would like to pay tribute to Nick and David and others for producing the draft specification and materially moving us on. 
However, I think it is even more important that we make sound decisions and are prepared to re-visit ones that may be unsound. 
Thus, I would urge the group to re-consider the decision made by those present at the F2F for the following reasons, which can be summarised as the decision is unnecessary and does not help our cause. 
Firstly the decision does not follow from the discussion. 
Decision: Bound to WSDL Discussion: premature to even establish this hierarchy/factoring .... there is a spectrum of "abstractness" (nothing bound -- fully bound) {Selective quoting deliberate} Secondly the decision does not meet the fairly obvious requirement that we should to enable a description of a basic message flow to be as simply as possible without requiring extraneous syntax. 
In raising this issue I put it like this (and this *requirement* should be clearly stated in the requirements document - if not please raise 662 as an issue against the Requirements document in addition to against the specification). 
One level could be called abstract or business process oriented or some such. 
It would support focus on the definition of the business exchanges. 
It would specify the allowed sequencing of messages and the nature of each message. 
It would not have to provide a precise specification (/schema) for each message nor how each message was to be transported. 
This it would allow agreement of the basic business 'protocol' but would be insufficient to enable interoperability on its own. 
Another level or type of Choreography description would provide a precise specification and schema for each message and how each message was to be transported. 
It would thus be a basis for interoperation or at least provide the interoperability specification of the upper layers of the protocol stack. 
Points for consideration: 1) The fact that this issue was raised on the 13 April 04 teleconference (and not by myself) and gave rise to a long discussion with at least 4 people speaking against the asserted resolution means that there is not consensus on the current solution amongst all those still active in the group. 
2) When attempting to describe just the message sequencing of a choreography (what one might describe as a 'pure' choreography insisting on having WSDL descriptions as well brings nothing but extra complexity. 
Or to put it the other way around: what do WSDL descriptions add that is required in this case? 
3) Imagine a choreography where one participant (A) exchanges messages with another (B) that exchanges messages with another (C) that exchanges messages with another (D) {i.e. four systems in a line). 
To describe this choreography using abstract BPEL would take a minimum of 2 abstract process plus the statement that there are only four participants (without that statement you need four abstract processes, otherwise you do not know that there is not something else connected to A or D). 
I am fairly sure that abstract BPEL does not demand WSDL descriptions. 
Surely our aim and differentiator from BPEL is that we need only one WS-Choreography XML document to describe this situation - at this level of detail. 
If we insist on having WSDL then you need 7 XML documents (1 WS-Choreography document and 6 WSDL documents) - and we loose! 
Proposal: That we allow several different versions of the same choreography (with differing amounts of detail) to be valid against the schema and against the text of the specification. 
At one end of the spectrum, the the simplest would be a single XML document that just described the allowed sequencing of messages of a stated nature (may just be stated in a comment or documentation element). 
There would be no requirement to provide WSDL descriptions or schemas for the messages. 
Another common point on this spectrum might be where there is the Choreography description plus the WSDL descriptions including the message schemas - as required by WSDL 2.0 - but no binding information. 
The other end on the spectrum would be to provide all the detail possible - Choreography description plus the WSDL descriptions plus bindings. 
The justification for this level of detail is that it is only this level of description that gets you anywhere near to interoperability. 
Notice to that it is my hope that you can start at the simple end and develop a description incrementally and have syntax and 'good practice' support as you do so. 
It should be possible to couple in WSDL descriptions naturally at the appropriate point in the development cycle. 
Different points on the spectrum can be used for different purposes and so it is advantageous to have them as valid and checkable. 
The simplest descriptions will be used in the initial design and to gain agreement to that design. 
That level and more detailed levels will be usable by developers (for instance) and the most detailed level will be useful for system administrators / system configuration. 
Sorry for the lengthy message, but I hope it makes the point.

&amp; tony_fletcher@btopenworld.com) Tony, The answer to your Why question in the case of BPEL might be as simple as the one you find in "Goals of the BPEL4WS Specification" (see [1]), where it says: "BPEL4WS is firmly set in the Web services world as the name implies. 
In particular, all external interactions occur through Web service interfaces described using WSDL. 
This has two aspects: (1) the process interacts with Web services through interfaces described using WSDL and (2) the process manifests itself as Web services described using WSDL". 
In any case, I am curious to see what types of answers your question on whether BPEL abstract processes need WSDL is going to get on the BPEL list.

&amp; tony_fletcher@btopenworld.com) Ugo Another way of thinking about this is from the perspecitive of where you start when developing a choreography. 
The first alternative is "top down" where you define the high level flow of messages first and then work out what the web services you need since they don't exist yet and finally create the WSDL definitions for those services so that you can start building them. 
The second alternative is "bottom up" where you have some Web services that already exist and you need to define the flow of messages so that you can "connect" them. 
I think that both approaches are valid, however following the "top down" approach is hard to do if you can't define the high level flow until you've defined the web services to use as WSDL definitions. 
Bottom line, if you have to have the WSDL definitions before you can develop a chorography, a.k.a. message flow, you are prohibiting the "top down" method of development that I think many, but not all, business analysts would often want to follow. 
Hope this helps. 
David Tony, The answer to your Why question in the case of BPEL might be as simple as the one you find in "Goals of the BPEL4WS Specification" (see [1]), where it says: "BPEL4WS is firmly set in the Web services world as the name implies.

&amp; tony_fletcher@btopenworld.com) mm1: David, you continue to discuss abstract choreography definition, references to business analysts, and an approach that infers your audience are business people. 
I would purport that WS-CDL is focused on the developer, pi-calculus and WSDL, and placement as a mechanism to help manage BPEL processes. 
Regardless of tooling, I do not see the business analysts having any notion about what this language means. 
I will be providing a response to your comments to my concerns about the abstract definition. 
My concern is primarily based on two important premises: * The fully abstract definition is not well-suited for a WSDL-based paradigm. 
* Trying to further abstract WS-CDL may dilute the language [1]. 
Martin and Steve, I would suggest we resolve this issue quickly. 
I had thought we reached agreement and clarity in Cannes. 
We are limited in moving forward unless we can bound this issue and the continuous swirl could impact our capability to deliver. 
Thanks. 
[1] I have seen several specifications that try to do too many things, rendering it either unusable or diluted.
