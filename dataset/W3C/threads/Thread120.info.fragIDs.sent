<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> All very strange.  </s>
<s> I had just re-downloaded it again and got the April version when I reported this.  </s>
<s> The date stamp of tidy.exe even said Aug. 7. Double-checked, and there was only tidy.exe in my path -- indeed, in my whole system period.  </s>
<s> Did again just now and it correctly reports the Aug. 4 date.  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Same thing happened here.  </s>
<s> Downloaded three times before it correctly reported the date.  </s>
<s> I don't know why.  </s>
