Thanks. 
All very strange. 
I had just re-downloaded it again and got the April version when I reported this. 
The date stamp of tidy.exe even said Aug. 7. Double-checked, and there was only tidy.exe in my path -- indeed, in my whole system period. 
Did again just now and it correctly reports the Aug. 4 date.

Same thing happened here. 
Downloaded three times before it correctly reported the date. 
I don't know why.
