Hi, I'm using tidy to screen-scrape the http://dmoz.org 
site (transformed to xml and parsed as xslt) and have recently moved from using the old COM wrapper (Andr? 
Blavier's) to the new one. 
I've noticed that in at least one case the old version interprets a bad closing table tag more like a browser than does the new one. 
If you go to any listings page and view the source you'll notice that the unordered list of sites is not in a table. 
Also note that there is a bad table closing tag near the top of the page. 
The old tidy "correctly" closed the table, while the new one closes the table at the end of the body. 
I've noticed other cases where tidy waits until the end of the body to close a tag that could have been closed earlier. 
Just thought this might be of some interest... Lucas Fletcher lucas@dealersinnotions.com 
Hi Lucas, Just get it straight, exactly which COM wrapper are you using? 
I did a refresh of Andr?'s version last spring. 
Since then, I did a brand new one based on TidyLib. 
I call the new one TidyATL to distinguish it from Andr?'s original. 
Anyway, I just looked at that page and I do not see what you see. 
I see four (4) tables: 1 for the header, 1 for the body and two for the footer. 
Each is closed perfectly well. 
Tidy accurately parses and prints all four. 
In fact, that page is fairly clean. 
The only warnings are the usual 'table lacks "summary" attribute' and the odd empty paragraph used for vertical spacing. 
Have another look and see if you still see the problem or perhaps you test on a copy of an older version of the page. 
If the latter, can you send a small sample that reproduces the behavior? 
take it easy, Charlie
