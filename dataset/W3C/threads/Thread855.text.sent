How does one build tidy so that it is statically linked? 
Please respond to me directly as I'm not on the list. 
Thanks Brad Thanks for answering my *dumb* question. 
Tidy works great. 
I just copy the binary to the other systems after the make. 
Nothing. 
A static build is the default with all distributed Makefiles.
