I have noticed the following typo in the WD. 
In Section 4, the sample has one small typo Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" 
The element name is InclusiveNamespace and the attribute name should be PrefixList Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" Regards, Umut Alev -- Software Design Engineer - MSXML -- After paying a little more attention to see what is going on under Section 4, I have noticed the following: The section for text is using InclusiveNamespacePrefix and List attribute but the schema is using InclusiveNamespace and PrefixList. 
Regards, Umut Alev -- Software Design Engineer - MSXML -- Thanks, I failed to update that example when we tweaked the schema, but it is now corrected: $Revision: 1.21 $ on $Date: 2001/12/20 18:56:27 $ GMT by $Author: reagle $ Joseph Reagle Jr. http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/ W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org
