Comments on comment tracking documents: What to do with the app source code? 
DanC suggests editors discretion to make editorial corrections Patrick suggests WG should review whether it considers issue editorial WG's views? 
Frank asks - what about comments we delayed to last call: Suggest: Editor's have discretion as we decided above Others - please send bwm email so he can register them in the lcc list Tracking Changes: We need to ensure that agreed changes don't get lost. 
That means a list of edits for each document. 
A list of changes made in each doc would also be useful for readers/reviewers of future versions. 
Suggest: o each doc maintains change list with id and pending/done status o each response to commentor which accepts a change includes the id of the change which should be listed in ed's draft when message sent o we need new editors drafts of the docs to point to from wg page www-rdf-comments o is for process - not general discussion o please let editors or the chairs handle comments process o please keep threads together - i.e. reply to messagage Any other process issues? 
9: FAQ: Relationship to XML Family of specs 10: Proposed Disposition of Last Call Comments This section of the agenda is for lcc's where there is a proposed disposition: 11: Comments Review Seeking volunteer to make weekly trawl through rdf comments and check we aren't dropping any. 
Each comment thread should end in either a [closed] or have an comment id assigned. 
Comments Awaiting Editors Response Concepts: Syntax: Schema: Semantics: Test Cases: 12: XML Schema 1.1 Requirements See: This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant, running on Jena 2 I am hoping for still greater clarity at the telecon. 
In the example of danc-01, danc-02 - I think there is a discussion to be had, and I want WG involvement in that discussion - should I be having this discussion: - on w3c-rdfcore-wg - on www-rdf-comments - at the telecon or all three or what? 
Such discussion might result in substantive textual changes. 
Jeremy Yep. 
The occasions where I've cross-posted I've wanted to follow up to the original sender, and open up discussion on rdfcore.

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ perl -e 's?ck?t??print:perl==pants if $_="Just Another Perl Hacker\n"' In general, my mental model is we clarify the issues(s) on comments, then take it for discussion within the WG. 
If the editor chooses to keep the commentor involved, we can use rdf-interest I think - danbri - would that be ok? 
I'm still hoping that we can: a) avoid cross posting b) keep comments for process oriented traffic. 
Brian Brian Re my actions, I haven't fwd'd announcement yet to SVG and other lists. 
I hope to do that later today or tommorrow. 
Dan snip Like Jeremy, I too am hoping for greater clarity. 
For example, what does "editorial corrections" cover? 
In the case of the comments delayed to last call, we have categorized them as "editorial" (including PPS's comments), but they may involve rewriting and/or adding material. 
I've no problem handling them as editorial, but I don't want to be bypassing the WG if it wants some say on whether/how these are handled. 
Certainly if it comes to a (potential or actual) disagreement between, say, Peter and I on handling something, I would raise it as an issue, but I'm less clear about other things. 
--Frank PS: As I mentioned earlier this week, I will certainly not be on the telecon at the beginning, and may not make it at all. 
Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 I think that puts the question nicely Frank. 
I am assuming an editor can ask the WG to consider any comment raised, so the editor can push anything on to the WG. 
The question in my mind is, how much does the WG wish to be involved and how much would it prefer the editors to just handle on their own. 
The point of the discussion in todays telecon is to ask the WG this question. 
I think possible answers include: o the WG reviews all changes o editors have freedom to fix trivial changes (typos, links, formatting, grammar), but the WG would like to review all other changes o the WG would like to review all comments, but may decide the issue is editorial and then leave it to the editor to fix o the WG would like to leave it entirely to the editors judgement of when to consult the WG. Brian Belated regrets due to a conflicting meeting.
