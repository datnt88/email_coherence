<s> Hello translators, I've started the translation of XHTML Basic 1.0 into Russian.  </s>
<s> A few questions to begin with: 1. Take a look at the following fragment: becomes Do I have to indicate the xml:lang of the latest acronym as "en" (The html xml:lang attribute is "ru")?  </s>
<s> Is it correct to translate the title without the acronym itself?  </s>
<s> Other examples include various acronyms and abbreviations like "W3C", "PDF", "Co.", "Inc.", "Ltd.", "DTD", "WAP", "WML", "SGML" etc.  </s>
<s> 2. Is there a way for me to get the right pronunciation for the names in the Acknowledgements and References sections?  </s>
<s> 3. I translate the first appearance of a person's name in the text,  </s>
<s> for example: Mark Beiker (Mark Baker), Deiv Reggitt (Dave Raggett) etc.  </s>
<s> Is it necessary that I indicate the language of a name like that Mark Beiker ( span xml:lang="en" Mark Baker /span )  </s>
<s> This may result in additional difficulties...  </s>
<s> 4. Do I have the right to translate the comments in the Appendix B, i. e.  </s>
<s> SGML Open Catalog Entry for XHTML Basic, XHTML Basic Driver, and XHTML Basic Customizations?  </s>
<s> I mean the preformatted text.  </s>
<s> I'm waiting forward to hearing from you!  </s>
<s> Happy translating.  </s>

<s> I think you should use a similar solution here as you use for names (3. below).  </s>
<s> For example acronym xml:lang='en' title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language"  </s>
<s> XHTML /acronym (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta)  </s>
<s> or XHTML (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta) (and maybe add the text only the first time, but some WAI experts may know better).  </s>
<s> (Well, for my name, please use 'Martin Dyurst' for transliteration.)  </s>
<s> Yes, I think this would be the right way to do it.  </s>
<s> It is definitely more work.  </s>
<s> But I don't see anything particularly difficult/complicated.  </s>
<s> Did I miss anything?  </s>
<s> I think you can translate the comments.  </s>
<s> It should help the readers understand what's going on.  </s>
<s> But I gess you should add a remark at the start of each piece (catalog, driver,...) saying that you translated the comments, and suggesting that  </s>
<s> for production, the version in the original is used.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello translators, First of all, may I ask you to help me to translate  </s>
<s> "content model" and "content elements"?  </s>
<s> XHTML /acronym (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta)  </s>
<s> Okay, I'm forward this piece to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Martin.  </s>
<s> It wasn't difficult to figure out how to pronounce your name, but there are a lot of others.  </s>
<s> I knew you would say that.  </s>
<s> In this case every appearance of  </s>
<s> XHTML Basic is to be enclosed in span xml:lang="en" too.  </s>
<s> You did, Martin.  </s>
<s> I'm not afraid of having a lot to do.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid I won't find the languages the names are written in.  </s>
<s> Some examples: Takuya Asada, Tantek Celik, Herman Elenbaas, Ann Navarro, Markku Vartiainen and others.  </s>
<s> I can guess their names origin but that'd be only a guess.  </s>
<s> In general it would be a good idea (for those writing the specs) to indicate a name's language using span with xml:lang on it.  </s>
<s> Do you mean content/sofware developing?  </s>
<s> Sounds logical.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> Happy translating.  </s>

<s> Hello Martin,  </s>
<s> Hello Alexander,  </s>
<s> just to swim against the tide.  </s>
<s> I never translate people?s names, not because I?m afraid of the work to find all languages for the xml:lang, but I think it is simply not necessary.  </s>
<s> I haven?t met any English speaker who pronounced for example my name the right way.  </s>
<s> That is not a matter of phonetic transcription, that?s a matter of that he is not a native German speaker, but that is not really a matter.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> I think it?s more important to recognize a name at once in other documents.  </s>
<s> To stay by your example: If you see the name Deiv Reggitt in a translation and look into another document (news, Rec, whatever) where the name is in it?s original form, do you recognize it at once?  </s>
<s> If you like to tell people, how to pronounce it, why not go the way: span xml:lang="en" Mark Baker /span (pronounced: Mark Beiker) .  </s>
<s> So that you ever give your reader the original name.  </s>
<s> Not necessarily.  </s>
<s> Agree. Happy working, Stefan Stefan Schumacher Oesterberg 20 0172/2718968 58553 Halver 02353/130119 Germany www.schumacher-netz.de  </s>
<s> Hello translators, Stefan,  </s>
<s> Ordnung muss sein, Stefan.  </s>
<s> For this purpose the following is done by the respectable Russian newspapers: the first appearance of a name is translated into Russian following by the English form in parenthesis.  </s>
<s> A hypothetical article: p Segodnia v 14:00 po moskovskomu vremeni v kongress-tzentre gostinitsi Radisson-Slavyanskay vstrechalis' dva nebezizvestnih predstavitelya konsortziuma W3C: Deiv Reggit ( span xml:lang="en" Dave Raggett /span ) i Martin Dyurst ( span xml:lang="de" Martin Duerst /span ).  </s>
<s> /p p Gospoda Reggit i Dyurst obsuzhdali problemi rasshireniya geografiyi W3C za schyot vostochnoy Evropi.  </s>
<s> /p  </s>
<s> Note that the first appearance of "Deiv Reggitt" was not translated (because it's a heading) as well as the third one (because it's not the first appearance).  </s>
<s> If you use this style any reader who reads the article from the  </s>
<s> very beginning will notice the original form.  </s>
<s> Assuming you're right what is the purpose of xml:lang attribute?  </s>
<s> Happy translating.  </s>

<s> Hello translators, Hello Alexander,  </s>
<s> Tell me, where do you know this sentence from?  </s>
<s> It?s the most popular sentence in Germany.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Ok, so if your newspapers do it this way, your readers are used to it.  </s>
<s> So it?s the right way for you.  </s>
<s> (Personly I would prefer to always read the original name of somebody and see the pronounciation once.) Our newpapers handle that a bit different.  </s>
<s> In this case I wouldn?t use the xml:lang, because it?s quite obvious, that XHTML Basic is an english term.  </s>
<s> Why explain (with xml:lang) something, that is already known.  </s>
<s> But that?s a point we surely can argue about hours and hours, where to use it and where not.  </s>
<s> In cases where you find similar terms in both languages, I would use it to explicitly distinguish between both terms.  </s>
<s> Or like you use it to tell your reader the english spelling.  </s>
<s> And maybe in several other cases.  </s>
<s> Happy weekend, Stefan Stefan Schumacher Oesterberg 20 0172/2718968 58553 Halver 02353/130119 Germany www.schumacher-netz.de  </s>
<s> For those who don't know, it means 'Order must be', or in a better translation, something like 'Things must be kept in order.'  </s>
<s> Well, I disagree.  </s>
<s> Have you ever seen a Russian name in its original?  </s>
<s> I think more or less the rule is, in most places: - Names in the same script are kept as is (within the limits of available accents,...) - Names in a different script are transliterated.  </s>
<s> In most cases, the original is not given at all, definitely not in German newspapers.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
