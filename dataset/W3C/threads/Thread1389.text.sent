I agree with Lisa's criticism of my counter-proposal, i.e. that it prevented DAV:all-dead-prop from being used as a property name. 
To avoid the introduction of the DAV:include element, and to reflect that fact that we are "adding stuff to what DAV:allprop returns", another minor variant we could consider would be: Cheers, Geoff class ) From: ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On

Old servers will ignore the "include" element -- a new client will be aware that is was ignored because the additionally selected properties will not turn up anywhere in the multistatus response. 
An old client will never use the "include" element, therefore there'll be no interoperatibility issues. 
I don't understand what you're saying about the "include" element. 
Maybe you should go back to the proposal. 
We have suggested adding an include element as child of propfind , which can be used to specifically add properties to those which would be reported by allprop . 
This allows to get the RFC2518- allprop *plus* specific properties from DeltaV/ACL with one call. 
Nevertheless, I do have strong logic for putting the property names under some container, and that's to distinguish property names from non-property names. 
"all-dead-prop" is not a property name. 
"checked-in" is. 
If they So do I. Please check what we proposed -- you were quoting from Geoff's example, not ours. 
We are currently doing it this way (with "include" in our own namespace): are glommed together in a list, then that's treating "all-dead-prop" as if it was a property name. 
That prevents the server from ever having a property called "all-dead-prop", since the XML element with that name was used the way you're proposing. 
This one won't interoperate with old servers, because allprop is defined to be EMPTY (in RFC2518). 
So if you hit an old server, you'll have to two two additional requests ( allprop and prop with the three named properties), while with include , it will be just one additional request (using prop to get the three additional properties). 
BTW: chapter 23.3.2 of RFC2518 gives a very similar example for legally extending PROPFIND. 
I find the arguments in RFC2518 Ch. 23.3 (esp. 
23.3.2.2) very convincing. 
Thus the most backward compatible solution is using include in its own namespace: where I don't specifically care what the namespace is (could also be "DAV:extended" or "DAV:addons-to-rfc2518"). 
If an implementor follows RFC2518, non-aware servers have to accept this message as a valid propfind/allprop (and indeed all I could test against do). 
Can someone of the more experienced DAVers suggest a good namespace? 
//Stefan I can't see why putting it into the DAV: namespace would be a problem. 
Although I'd prefer to have other WebDAV related specs (like ACL and deltaV) use their own namespaces, this one seems to apply to all WebDAV servers, no matter whether any combination of ACL and DeltaV is implemented...
