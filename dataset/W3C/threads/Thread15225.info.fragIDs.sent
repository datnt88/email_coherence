<s> Good start.  </s>
<s> The first part of insert is right on the money.  </s>
<s> However, the levels do not reflect the amount of change.  </s>
<s> They are a mixture.  </s>
<s> The mixture is in the latest draft.  </s>
<s> I would go with your start.  </s>
<s> Then just say "the three levels are determined as follows" Or something like that.  </s>

<s> I've tried to put it into lay persons terms so that most people, including those whose first language is not English, can understand it.  </s>
<s> I suggest the explanation be added to the section of the Guidelines called "Priorities and Techniques".  </s>
<s> Here is how the whole section would read with the inserted paragraph Priorities and Techniques This WCAG 2.0 Working Draft does not assign priorities to guidelines, as did WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Instead, guidelines include three levels of success criteria.  </s>
<s> The main WCAG 2.0 Working Draft document does not include technology-specific implementation requirements or techniques, but it does include links to technology-specific requirements as well as technology-specific examples and techniques.  </s>
<s> This Working Draft of WCAG 2.0 is a follow-on and evolution of WCAG 1.0 and reflects feedback received since the publication of WCAG 1.0 in May 1999.  </s>
<s> Although the same approaches to accessibility are followed in 1.0 and 2.0, the organization and structure have been improved significantly.[insert  </s>
<s> starts here] One significant change is that the 2.0 version of the guidelines are not divided up according to "Priority".  </s>
<s> The reason for this is that each success criteria, regardless of priority category that it would fall into, could make the critical difference between accessibility and inaccessibility for some group of users.  </s>
<s> Given this, it is impossible to make some checkpoints more important than others without implying that some users are more important than others.  </s>
<s> Thus, the guidelines have been reorganized based upon the degree to which a checkpoint may require an author to adjust the presentation or expression of content.  </s>
<s> [end of insert] In addition, the principles have been worded to make it easier to understand their application across the wide range of existing and emerging technologies.  </s>
<s> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working carefully to enable organizations and individuals that are currently using WCAG 1.0 (which remains stable and referenceable at this time) to ensure that they will eventually be able to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> To understand how this eventual transition would be facilitated, please refer to the (draft) Mapping Between WCAG http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/10/27-mapping.html 1.0 and the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.  </s>
