After the tele-conference it hit me as to why I felt uncomfortable with checkpoints 2.7.1 and 2.7.2. First, let me put these checkpoints in my own words to be sure I'm understanding their intent correctly: 2.7.1: [Priority 1] The authoring tool should have explanations of its accessible authoring practices in its help system(s) (context sensitive help, on-line documentation, hardcopy documention, etc.). 
2.7.2: [Priority 2] The authoring tool should have explanations of it's accessibility features clearly called out in each help topic. 
(example: help discussion for adding an image also describes how to add alt text) If my understanding of these is correct, then satisfying 2.7.2, a specific way of integrating with help, satisfies 2.7.1, the more general help requirement. 
This means that it's easy for the authoring tool developer to satisfy a P1 and skip the P2, not a good thing I think. 
I propose a general principle for checkpoints is to make them as disjoint as possible. 
When they're not disjoint we need to be more careful in assigning priorities. 
Some ideas for fixing this particular case are: 1) Make 2.7.2 a technique for 2.7.1 2) Eliminate 2.7.2 and: 2.1) Expand 2.7.1 to call out each part of the authoring tools 
help systems and how accessible authoring practices should be integrated. 
or 2.2) Create seperate checkpoints for each help system that prescribe integration. 
4) Give 2.7.2 a priority 1. 
I lean to number 1. -- Bruce 
I think itis possible to satisfy 2.7.2 without satisfying 2.7.1 - whatever help is available includes the relevant accessibility features without documenting all the accessibility features. 
I suspect that it would take a contrived case to demonstrate this. 
I would go along with making 2.7.2 a technique if the following things are clear: 1. 
The help system is included in the integration of look and feel checkpoint, which could be done by suggesting some areas for consideration in techniques for look and feel. 
(i.e. accessibility help is not a cyber-ghetto chapter for people who want to be nice to disabled people.) 2. Help examples should always be accessible examples - IMG should have ALT, and if relevant LONGDESC (this is also crossover with the look and feel stuff as per Kynn's proposal) etc I think that a lot of this is already covered in the techniques section for this guideline, which is encouraging.

I disagree. 
Some of the ideas here should remain checkpoints. 
I would rephrase as follows: 2.7.1: [Priority 1] Include direction for the use of all accessible authoring practices supported by the authoring tool. 
(JR comment: "direction" may be a good catch-all for the many different types of help+doc that will be listed in the techniques) 2.7.2: [Priority 2] (JR comment: my suggested Priority) Help topics should feature all applicable accessible authoring practices, regardless of the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Priority. 
(JR comment: this is promotion with a big P! For example alt-text doesn't need to be promoted because it is required, LONGDESC does need to be promoted) 2.7.3: [Priority 1] Examples must conform to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
