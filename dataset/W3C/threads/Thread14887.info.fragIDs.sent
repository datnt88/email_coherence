<s> Sounds somewhat exclusionary for groups of end users for which there is no identifiable "assistive technologies" which are in widespread  </s>

<s> "Understanding" is a problem, what justification is there, that these groups of users need to understand the content, this definition would require full translation into all languages of all content, and full explanations of all required knowledge to understand this page - Some other word is needed I feel, or a definition of understanding that is different to the common one.  </s>

<s> Actually this is an understandable misinterpretation of the principle, which results from a genuine ambiguity in my original wording.  </s>
<s> A reformulation will be posted in my next message which, I hope, will be improved in this respect.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints in the minimum set are those which, if satisfied, eliminate barriers that would otherwise prevent an identifiable group of users, (with the aid of any applicable client-side software and assistive technologies), from reading, understanding, navigating or interacting with the content.  </s>
<s> Notes 1.  </s>
<s> There is no assumption that all users are relying on assistive technology.  </s>
<s> 2. Any checkpoint which results in a certain group of users' being unable to carry out any one or more of the relevant functions with respect to the content (viz., reading, understanding, interaction and navigation) would qualify for inclusion in the minimum set.  </s>
<s> 3.  </s>
<s> Where failure to implement a checkpoint would make reading, understanding, interaction and/or navigation more difficult for some groups, but would not entirely preclude functioning along any of these dimensions, due for instance to the availability of relevant assistive technology, the checkpoint would not be included in the minimum set, but it would be included in the guidelines as "good advice" to authors.  </s>
<s> Where appropriate success criteria can be  </s>
<s> defined, such checkpoints would count toward a higher level (i.e., beyond the minimum) level of conformance.  </s>
<s> The principle expounded here is meant to be equivalent, in substance, to Wendy's original idea as captured in OTACS 2, but offers a less stringent interpretation of what makes content inaccessible to users.  </s>
<s> Specifically, in order for a checkpoint to qualify, it must make the difference between access and lack of access in any one or more of the four dimensions.  </s>
<s> These dimensions correspond, broadly, to guidelines 1-3 of WCAG 2.0 as formulated in the latest draft.  </s>
<s> Jason Would it be possible to give a couple of checkpoint examples that fall _outside_ the minimum set as defined.  </s>

<s> The same examples apply as in Wendy's original proposal.  </s>
<s> I would suggest a careful reading of the checkpoint-by-checkpoint analysis in Much of the confusion in recent discussions is due, I think, to various working group members' having somewhat different conceptions of what is meant by the several proposals that have been advanced.  </s>

<s> The "Eliminate Barriers with aid of relevant AT" principle is meant to be a recasting of OTACS 2, but from a user's perspective which makes the access benefit explicit while drawing the same distinction between core and non-core checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Cheers Jason I have turned it over in my mind and slightly paraphrasing your note 2 gives the following "Any checkpoint which results in a certain group of users' being _unable_ to read, understand, interact with or navigate content would qualify for inclusion in the minimum set."  </s>
