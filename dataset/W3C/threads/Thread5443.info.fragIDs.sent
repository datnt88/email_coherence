Firstly, Eola is way off base with their patent claims and at least 5 years too late with their so-called "discovery." 
Their claims was already being worked out at five years before they applied for their meritless patent. 
But this is all another story.... Here is why I think Eola patent does not apply to modern browsers: Eola bases their bogus patent claim on identifying hypermedia through the URL. 
Basically, in their patent they identify a media application with the URL http://foo.com/somemedia.mpg 
Modern browser's don't work this way. 
For example, IE will load a media player for somemedia.mpg 
with the URL http://foo.com/29sjsghegegasls 
Why? 
Because unlike the Eola approach, modern browsers identify the object being returned by the server not on the URL, but on the content headers. 
Thus, browsers are not limited to what they can display as they would if they used Eola's approach, and this I think is significant enough difference between the two approaches to render modern browsers in the clear.

The charter is announced here: Quotes: "The mailing list archives of the HTML PAG are member-only." 
"This charter as well as the PAG report to the Director will be public. 
At regular intervals, the PAG should also provide status updates to the public." 
"To communicate with the public, the PAG should use the public-web-plugins@w3.org 
list." 
However the formation of the HTML PAG seems to have been announced via the press in the article that Richard Smith linked to: but not yet on this list. 
Let's hope the status updates won't go the same way.

my livelihood depends on this stuff and it would be nice to feel represented.

Virgina, if you look at the PAG charter, the group use this list (public-web-plugins) to communicate with the public This includes monitoring the list for input by the public. 
As you can see from the "W3C Membership" page there are no ad-hoc or special memberships for W3C.
