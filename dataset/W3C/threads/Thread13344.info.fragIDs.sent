<s> I've updated the ERT with several suggestions from our last telecon: - Added an appendix on links to associated sites: Please let me know of other links that could be added here.  </s>
<s> - Added new 'example language' to technique 5.5.A (table summary).  </s>
<s> (Brian - was this what you meant in the telecon?)  </s>
<s> - Added a technique for determining the purpose of a table (Wendy - I've modified and added to your language.) - Added a user prompt (description) for 'linearized'.  </s>
<s> I performed a couple of tests with Lynx and it seems to read tables a row at a time.  </s>
<s> If cells are merged, it still tries to do this.  </s>
<s> For example, if a table is organized like a telephone keypad: 1,2,3 4,5,6 7,8,9 It will read 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 If the cells 1 and 4 are merged such as: m,2,3 m,5,6 7,8,9 It will read m,2,3,5,6,7,8,9  </s>

<s> Yes, nice enhancements to my suggestion.  </s>
<s> Noticed the 'placeholder Summary values' is empty.  </s>
<s> How about 'Summary' and 'Table' for starters.  </s>

<s> Renewable energy charging, soon!  </s>
<s> The description of "linearization" now reads When a table is 'linearized' the cells are usually read a row at a time, starting at the left and moving to the right.  </s>
<s> That's true, but I'd suggest adding something like: 'More specifically, "linearized" means reading the cells in the order in which they appear in the HTML source of the table'.  </s>
<s> This is equivalent to the Web Contents Accessibility Guidelines which defines a linearized table as "A table rendering process where the contents of the cells become a series of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after another.  </s>
<s> The paragraphs will occur in the same order as the cells are defined in the document source.  </s>
