<s> This chopping and rechopping sections went on for most of the pre-rec life of the Web Content Guidelines.  </s>
<s> I can think of 2 new ways of dividing the document up in the last 10 minutes.  </s>
<s> I think that the various divisions are arbitrary, although some will be readily understood by more people than others.  </s>
<s> The two groups whose input is important is producers of tools and users of tools (who are trying to decide whether their tool does what we think it ought to do).  </s>
<s> If there is a division which clearly makes more sense to these groups than having a single set of guidelines, then there would be an argument for using that division.  </s>
<s> But I am not convinced that there is such a division.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> I really would rather have them be one big section with 10 or so subpoints, because that allows people to build their OWN mental divisions as they read them, rather than us forcing something on them.  </s>
<s> And presumably it allows for education and outreach materials which may target one specific group to format things as they wish, too.  </s>
<s> (I'm assuming that while the normative form of all WAI deliverables is the way they're defined in the working groups, these specifics may be rewritten in the future at some time, e.g. the WCAG -- Quicktips.) So, have we proven that all divisions are arbitrary and it's better just to stick with a straight list yet?  </s>

<s> CMcCN:: "I can think of 2 new ways of dividing the document up in the last 10 minutes."  </s>
<s> WL: The absolute maximum number of "Sections" into which me may divide the currently agreed-upon guidelines is 10.  </s>
<s> The absolute minimum number of "Sections" is 1.  </s>
<s> On our plate right now is the decision of whether to use 1 or 2. Any argument used for 2 is likely valid for 3 - 10.  </s>
<s> The concept of division is anathema to the overall idea of inclusion because the basis for the choice of 2 is essentially that there is "obviously" a difference between the interface to the tool and the output of the tool.  </s>
<s> From the point of view of Web Access this is not "obvious" whether "the folks who write my help text are completely separate from the folks who design the UI for accessing help" in Bruce's context or whether "the folks who create the Web are the same as the folks who 'use' the Web" in my context.  </s>
<s> I daresay that within any hierarchical tool design factory there are divisions of labor along various lines that have historical and practical bases but that shouldn't alter the notion that "we're all  </s>
<s> in this together" and if we separate, or divide on the basis of author/user we err on the side of exclusion.  </s>
<s> I am not yet swayed from the notion of oneness in our guideline set.  </s>
<s> See ya  </s>
<s> Friday/Saturday/Sunday. Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I'm with William on this one, I think that arbitrary separation into sections will hurt us overall.  </s>
<s> I think people are smart enough to figure out what different sections mean.  </s>
<s> But, out of curiousity, is there any reason that we have the accessibility of content created listed BEFORE the accessibility of the tool?  </s>
<s> The current division implies, without possibly meaning to, a level of priority.  </s>
<s> I think "produce accessible code" is the "expected" guideline, and thus it may actually be productive to put that _after_ the guidelines on "make this tool usable by a broad audience."  </s>
<s> The reason for this is the "cold water in your face" argument.  </s>
<s> To many people the most surprising thing may be "how to make this tool work for these folks" not "make valid HTML" (which is what the WAI has been saying all along -- you could sum up the "obvious" guideline for this group with "follow the WCAG with respect to code you create.")  </s>
<s> Giving emphasis to the non-intuitive is always good as it breeds a sense of surprise and "learning something new."  </s>
<s> Starting with the obvious may be _too_ obvious and expected.  </s>
<s> So my suggestions are: * Lose the distinctions between section 2 and section 3 * Number the guidelines 1 to N * Put the accessibility-of-the-tool guidelines FIRST Kynn Bartlett kynn@hwg.org  </s>
