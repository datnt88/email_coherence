* Rijk van Geijtenbeek wrote in ciwas: HTML Tidy does a great job of cleaning up, and converting to the use of stylesheets. 
In the case you describe I fear manual editing of the files will be needed even after running them through Tidy. 
For example, the automated process might convert all font size=-1 .. /font tags to span class=c1 ... /span in one document, and span class=c2 ... /span in another. 
This makes it hard to 'just' drop in a system wide linked stylesheet. 
But there's also the option to just drop all these FONTs before cleaning up. 
How could we improve Tidy to ease this? 
If possible, please follow up to html-tidy@w3.org.

In article 3c066a9a.20827648@news.bjoern.hoehrmann.de , one of infinite monkeys Use a backend lookup-table (I'd suggest *dbm) and select substitutions from it. 
Devise a new class only if the construct in question hasn't been seen before. 
Then you can have a tidy-css program to generate the required stylesheet from the dbm. 
That's a sufficiently trivial task to be done as with an hour or so of Perl hacking. 
Well, if you say so.

Implement a clairvoyance module? 
It's hard to detect logic in random tagsoup. 
In my experience, Tidy does what it can. 
The option to just ignore the font tags and drop them from the output is invaluable in the case were you want to impose a generic site-wide style with class-less selectors. 
It would be nice if I could do some easy preprocessing: add a LINK element to all output, for example. 
I doubt if it would be possible to prevent all those c1/c20 classes by mapping them to existing classes (or element selectors) in linked stylesheets. 
Done. 
Now to find a place to sign up for that list...
