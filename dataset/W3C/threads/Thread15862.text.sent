Section 508 of the Rehab Act requires that federal agencies not buy inaccessible. 
It's not much of a reach for that to apply to Web Authoring Tools *and their output*. 
If a word processor or whatever has the "facility" to produce inaccessible code as a by-product of its "save as markup" feature, it should not be acceptable for federal purchase?? Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Okay, so I'll be a federal agency. 
Please define what "accessible" and "inaccessible" HTML code is, so I can know what to buy? 
This is part of the problem with trying to rely on laws passed by non-technical people that will be applied by non-technical people to a technical issue. 
You and I can figure out what "inaccessible" means, but what does it mean in practice? 
Is an editor "accessible" if it provides automatic ALT attributes (such as ALT="image34.jpg 3752 bytes")? 
What if it "provides support for ALT attributes"? 
Or does it have to _require_ ALT attributes be used? 
(And how does that mesh with autogenerated ALTs?) You see, you and I can't even define what "accessible" means, let alone expect a government bureaucrat to make that decision. 
If someone asks the maker of X brand of web software, be that Microsoft or SoftQuad or Netscape or anyone else, "Does this soft- ware produce accessible code?" they will say "Yes, it does", for whatever definition fits their product. 
And so we're back to square one -- except that now the bureaucrat thinks she's doing a good job on web accessibility, even if she's not!

I don't think they do that now; at least, not the page author guidelines.
