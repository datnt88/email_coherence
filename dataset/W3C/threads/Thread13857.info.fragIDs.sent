<s> Because the GL group appears to be nearing closure on the guidelines document, I wish to make another appeal that language be added that will clarify the scope of the document.  </s>
<s> If you do not intend to deal at length with readability of language, privacy issues, etc., then I suggest a statement such as follows: "This document does not address a variety of special issues which may significantly influence the accessibility and usability of Web pages.  </s>
<s> Examples of such issues include: readability of language (e.g., language complexity, difficulty of vocabulary, etc), privacy (e.g., concerns about how personal information will be used), sensitivity (e.g., reactions to how the document refers to individuals with disabilities), legal and moral issues (e.g., reactions to material that is legally prohibited or contrary to community or personal standards).  </s>
<s> These unaddressed issues tend to concern how individuals process or think about Web content in contrast to whether that content is available to their senses, the latter being a major focus of the WAI page authoring guidelines."  </s>

<s> Eric's formulation, suitably refined, would provide an appropriate disclaimer to accompnay the document.  </s>
<s> Perhaps reference could also be  </s>
<s> made, in general terms, to other WAI guideline activities in order to make clear the division of subject matter as between the various documents which are currently being prepared.  </s>
<s> I recognise that it may not be proper to refer to guidelines which have not yet been completed, so perhaps the scope could be clarified by indicating that issues pertaining to the design of user interfaces (the UA work) and authoring tools, are not directly within the purview of the page authoring guidelines, though it is expected that authoring tools will produce compliant code, and that user agents will provide the facilities necessary to enable people with diverse needs to access the content, in the strict sense of the latter term which Eric has rightly identified.  </s>
<s> I heartily concur with Dr. Hansen's suggestion!  </s>

<s> I heartily agree with Eric's "disclaimer" and the addition of refinements such as suggested by Jason.  </s>
