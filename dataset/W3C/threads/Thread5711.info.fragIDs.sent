<s> We have used OWL to write OperOnt ontology.  </s>
<s> (http://siul02.si.ehu.es/Aingeru/OperOnt.owl)  </s>
<s> OperOnt is an ontology created in the context of the AINGERU system to describe its operational model.  </s>
<s> That is, OperOnt describes concepts that allow the interoperation of actors at a semantic level without pre-establishing specific protocols.  </s>
<s> The ontology includes descriptions of classes, properties and axioms involving actors, messages for the communication among actors, and subjects of the messages.  </s>
<s> The descriptions are presented in three groups.  </s>
<s> First, descriptions of classes which in turn are divided in three areas: actors, messages and subjects.  </s>
<s> Second, descriptions of properties that shape individuals in the classes.  </s>
<s> Third, axioms specifying some constraints and rules.  </s>

<s> thanks much for letting us know - looks like a nice use of OWL, and I was pleased to see your ontology makes good use of some of OWL's modeling features.  </s>

<s> I see some details that are probably not as you intended: xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/??/owl#" Try xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#" per http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#owl-uri-namespace  </s>
<s> Also, where you write I think you mean owl:Class rdf:about="http://siul02.si.ehu.es/Aingeru/OperOnt.owl#Actor"  </s>
<s> You might try some of the syntax checking tools from our implementation report for example which reports problems such as [line=134:column=-1] URI 'file:/C:/Aingeru/OperOnt/actors#ConditionChecker Agent' cannot be resolved against curent base URI Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
