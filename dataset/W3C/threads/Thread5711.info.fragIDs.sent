We have used OWL to write OperOnt ontology. 
(http://siul02.si.ehu.es/Aingeru/OperOnt.owl) 
OperOnt is an ontology created in the context of the AINGERU system to describe its operational model. 
That is, OperOnt describes concepts that allow the interoperation of actors at a semantic level without pre-establishing specific protocols. 
The ontology includes descriptions of classes, properties and axioms involving actors, messages for the communication among actors, and subjects of the messages. 
The descriptions are presented in three groups. 
First, descriptions of classes which in turn are divided in three areas: actors, messages and subjects. 
Second, descriptions of properties that shape individuals in the classes. 
Third, axioms specifying some constraints and rules.

thanks much for letting us know - looks like a nice use of OWL, and I was pleased to see your ontology makes good use of some of OWL's modeling features.

Thanks for letting us know about this work. 
I see some details that are probably not as you intended: xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/??/owl#" Try xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#" per http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#owl-uri-namespace 
Also, where you write I think you mean owl:Class rdf:about="http://siul02.si.ehu.es/Aingeru/OperOnt.owl#Actor" 
You might try some of the syntax checking tools from our implementation report for example which reports problems such as [line=134:column=-1] URI 'file:/C:/Aingeru/OperOnt/actors#ConditionChecker Agent' cannot be resolved against curent base URI Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
