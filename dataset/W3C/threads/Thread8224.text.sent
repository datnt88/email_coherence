FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in Montreal, Canada. 
- Jim From the Web page: The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static information to more dynamic and interactive forms. 
A number of new standards and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web. 
The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web design, software engineering, and information technology communities to discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. 
Architectural styles and tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse. 
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and experience accounts are lacking. 
The explosion of non-traditional computing platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the Web. 
WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not limited to): * Migrating to Web services * Web quality determination and improvement through process and product control * Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable * Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure * Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple platforms * Applying traditional software engineering activities such as architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites * Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution WSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2002). 
ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event focused on the modernization of existing systems. 
ICSM 2002's theme of "maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems" nicely compliments WSE 2002's overall theme and goals. 
Hi, re: RFC2518 issue: PROPFIND_INFINITY. 
So the plan is that servers MAY reject PROPFIND with depth infinity, and the currently suggested return value is 403 (forbidden). 
Now what applies to PROPFIND should apply to REPORT as well, right? 
The ACL draft defines only reports with depth == 0, and requires 400 (bad request) otherwise. 
RFC3253 is silent about that issue, suggesting that servers may not reject the request. 
It would be nice if we could make this consistent before it's too late... Julian What do you have in mind for making this consistent? 
There are some reports in RFC-3253 that are usefully applied with Depth 0 (e.g. DAV:expand-property and DAV:version-tree). 
There are others that only make sense for Depth=0 (DAV:compare-baseline and DAV:merge-preview). 
So I agree that we can make the reports that only make sense for Depth=0 to say so explicitly, as does the ACL spec. 
Is that what you had in mind? 
Cheers, Geoff Hi, re: RFC2518 issue: PROPFIND_INFINITY.

What I meant is that for the same reasons a server may want to reject PROPFINDs with depth infinity, it may want to reject REPORTs with depth infinity as well. 
In particular, I can use DAV:expand-property to simulate a PROPFIND/DAV:prop, so it doesn't seem to make sense to change RFC2518 to make PROPFIND/DAV:prop/depth-infinity optional, while requiring support for an equivalent REPORT (DAV:expand-property). 
Julian I agree that if PROPFIND MAY refuse to process a Depth:infinity request, than it should also be the case that REPORT MAY refuse to process a Depth:infinity request. 
For REPORT, I'd also define a DAV:error value for this condition, so that a client can tell that it is non-support for Depth:Infinity that caused the failure. 
But note that I think it is fine for specific reports to return 400 (meaning that the report by definition does not allow the specified Depth), while other reports return 403 meaning that this implementation does not support it, even if it the report is defined for that Depth.

Julian Ok, so we have: - REPORT not defined for this depth -- 400 (bad request) - REPORT is defined, but server doesn't allow depth infinity -- 403 (forbidden). 
Should we define an error condition name for this situation and add that to the RFC3253 (proposal: "DAV:depth-infinity-allowed")? 
Julian That sounds sensible to me. 
If there are no objections, I'll add this as the resolution to this issue to the RFC 3253 Errata/Issue list.

Julian The proposal makes sense to me, as does the error condition name.
