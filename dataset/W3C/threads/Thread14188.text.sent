Can anyone refresh my memory as to why using LANG is still not a P1 ? 
I think this was raised in the past at least by Nir, Jason and myself. 
If you don't know the language of some text, a speech system will output garbage, therefore making it a P1. 
In fact, I need to know for the EO group working on the quicktips. 
I think the reason was that the user is expected to be able to set the language of the braille or speech software manually if the LANG attribute is not supplied. 
It should not be priority one. 
Adding body LANG="zh" to a page will not make a Chinese page speak correctly with an English text to speech synthesizer. 
While there are a lot of good reasons to use LANG and I support that, we should limit Priority 1 items to things that have a direct, beneficial impact on the accessibility of the web.

On the other hand, with a speech synthesiser that handles English, Mandarin and Japanese, and defaults to Japanese, adding BODY LANG-"zh" will have a chinese page spoken correctly.

Uh, not really. 
First the information has to get to the screen reader, which then needs to figure it out and use it. 
None do that currently. 
So adding LANG will not improve accessibility of pages today. 
Everyone has to cooperate - the author, the user agent and the assistive technology. 
Like I said, good idea - maybe even great idea, but not a priority 1 issue. 
Try this: 1) Write some web pages and use a screen reader with a multilingual speech engine. 
2) Throw in some LANG attributes and start writing in French. 
3) Listen as the screen reader interprets the French into English and starts speaking it using English. 
I won't debate the theoretical benefits, I'm sure there are many, but as a practical matter, is this issue so pressing that it MUST be done by page authors or their pages are inaccessible? 
The following needs to happen: 1) There needs to be a conduit of information about the language to the accessibility aid - DOM is the way to go here. 
This facility is already built into Active Accessibility. 
2) The few existing assistive technology products that are multilingual need to rev and understand the information. 
The only screen reader currently that is multilingual, and uses the Dynamic HTML object model still reads the text off the screen, so the language info is useless without a revision. 
I'm not aware of anyone using the language information available via Active Accessibility. 
It's never been requested or commented on. 
3) Get page authors to support it. 
My bar is fairly high for priority 1 issues. 
I just don't think that LANG attributes meet that bar. 
Does anyone else disagree? 
Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Accessibility and Disabilities Group, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!" 
It should be remembered that there is not always a "screen reader" intermediary between the user agent and the text to speech software. 
Indeed, some user agents are designed from the start to provide speech output. 
I am not sure whether any of them supports the LANG attribute yet, but they will undoubtedly do so reasonably soon. 
The user agent group could introduce a priority 1 requirement to the effect that speech output systems must offer the user an option to override the language choice which is in effect. 
This would enable users to handle situations in which no language, or an incorrect language, is specified via the LANG attribute. 
Thus, I think there is a priority 1 issue here, but it belongs in the user agent guidelines. 
For our guidelines, the existing priority 2 requirement that the LANG attribute be specified where necessary, should remain. 
The Japanese version of Home Page Reader does not (currently) use LANG attribute. 
English and Japanese use completely different character set (Alphabet and Kanji). 
Therefore detecting Japanese and English is not so difficult for TTS Engine. 
ProTALKER does not speak Native-English. 
It speaks limited English word in Japanese accent. 
We are looking at supporting the LANG attribute in the future. 
I agree that it is not a P1 for authors, but perhaps a high priority for UAs Regards, Phill Jenkins Currently [1], support for "lang" is just one aspect of Priority 1 support for HTML. - Ian [1] Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) 
OK, but this requires that the charset information is correct. 
Which is in fact a better way to do it. 
I guess the i18n people could give us a more definitive answer. 
I think it might be a linguistics problem. 
I realise that I have not actually expresssed a priority opinion. 
This is on purpose - mine is not yet firm.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA In theory, in HTML the charset and the language are two entirely independent issues. 
"charset" is a technical matter that relates only to the encoding of coded characters. 
There are three valid ways of including characters into an HTML document: coded characters, "numerical characer references" (&amp;#number; representation), and named character entities where available. 
Only one of these three representations is affected by the "charset": the others could in theory (and in practice too, if Netscape had been conformant to publised specifications) utilise an extensive repertoire of characters in a document whose "charset" was us-ascii, or whatever other charset was convenient to the author, just as it works in conforming browsers. 
It would be feasible to transmit, for example, Japanese using solely &amp;#number; representations of the Japanese characters, without any mention of an unusual "charset" in the Content-type header. 
While I'm not suggesting that this possibility would be attractive to a native Japanese author, it might very well be selected by a non-Japanese author as a more resiliently portable representation when they wished to include some Japanese content into an otherwise Roman-alphabet document. 
I'm sorry if this seems pedantic, but there has been far too much confusion in the past when people have muddled up these issues; it would seem a pity to set off down that road again, in spite of the plausible heuristic reasons for wanting to do so. 
(And then there's the question of what you would do with a document that contained English text written in Japanese characters, or vice versa.) best regards Would it be possible to change the headers in Techniques document to something else than A.N or B.N? I think it is somewhat confusing to go from Guideline A.1 to checkpoint A.1.3 which is then under B.7 in Techniques document or A1.1 which is under A.2. When going back and forth between the documents it is easy to get lost. 
Maybe the Techniques document could just use plain numbering, such as 1.2.3 or add something like TA.2 or TA.7 to better differentiate from guidelines. 
Marja Hi Marja, This is all easy to change in the document production sense. 
I will defer to Wendy and Gregg's opinion about the numbering schemes, however (this is something we've discussed before, in fact).

Alan is right. 
The technique of guessing a language by charset is a 'Bad Idea' (TM?). 
So we should use LANG to specify the language. 
Analagously, the http header 'content-language' defines a language for the whole document, not for bits of it. 
Where languages are mixed in a document (I haven't seen this in any US-based document. 
It is much more common in places like Europe, Australia, Asia, and even Canada Charles In theory, in HTML the charset and the language are two entirely independent issues.

As an example, take a look at "International Layout in CSS" [1] WD. Charset of this document is ISO-8859-1, and the basic language of this document is specified as html lang="en-US" . 
Yet this document uses several other languages like span lang="ja" tate naka yoko /span . 
"Tate naka yoko" is a Japanese word, even if it is written in latin alphabet and encoded in ISO-8859-1. 
You can't guess the language from charset.
