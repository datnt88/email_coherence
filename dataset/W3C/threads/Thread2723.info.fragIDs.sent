What is the significance of including the word ``canonical'' in the following 
sentence in draft-ietf-http-authentication-01 section 1.2? 
The cited section 
of the HTTP/1.1 draft defines the "root" URL of a server, but the word 
canonical doesn't appear there. 
Is this an editorial bug in one spec or the 
other? 
``The realm value (case-sensitive), in combination with the canonical root URL 
(see section 5.1.2 of [2]) of the server being accessed, defines the protection 
space.'' 
Might be an artifact of moving the syntactical definition of a URL to be a 
reference so that the definition of canonical got lost?

Hi, I am a new member in this list. 
How can I get a copy HTTP/1.1 draft ? 
Thanx.

I thought URLs had a caonical form -- bad chars coverted to %xx, etc. 
Maybe 
it's in the URL RFC?

In general, URLs do _not_ have a canonical form. 
However, HTTP defines some equivalences for URLs (e.g., that http://host is 
equivalent to http://host/, and by using the generic 
syntax for host names, the host part is case insensitive). 
Some particular HTTP servers MAY define other equivalences, e.g., that http://host/dir is equivalent to http://host/dir/ 
and to http://host/dir/index.html. 
I'm less sure how equivalence is turned into canonicalization for the purpose of creating a 'canonical root', though.

To the original post ... sounds like an editorial bug in the authentication draft. 
After Larry's post I went digging 'cause I knew I'd seen a definition in the past of a 'canonical form'. 
Here is what I found in rfc1945 ... (in section 3.2.2): 
The canonical form for "http" URLs is obtained by converting any UPALPHA characters in host to their LOALPHA equivalent (hostnames are case-insensitive), eliding the [ ":" port ] if the port is 80, and replacing an empty abs_path with "/". 
In rfc2068 (3.2.3) we provide a definition of URI Comparison which is probably a better approach. 
Hence I think removal of 'canonical' from the authentication draft will not change the intent and will align the documents.
