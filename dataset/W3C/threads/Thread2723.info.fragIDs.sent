<s> In general, URLs do _not_ have a canonical form.  </s>
<s> However, HTTP defines some equivalences for URLs (e.g., that http://host is  </s>
<s> equivalent to http://host/, and by using the generic  </s>
<s> syntax for host names, the host part is case insensitive).  </s>
<s> Some particular HTTP servers MAY define other equivalences, e.g., that http://host/dir is equivalent to http://host/dir/  </s>
<s> and to http://host/dir/index.html.  </s>
<s> I'm less sure how equivalence is turned into canonicalization for the purpose of creating a 'canonical root', though.  </s>

<s> To the original post ... sounds like an editorial bug in the authentication draft.  </s>
<s> After Larry's post I went digging 'cause I knew I'd seen a definition in the past of a 'canonical form'.  </s>
<s> Here is what I found in rfc1945 ... (in section 3.2.2):  </s>
<s> The canonical form for "http" URLs is obtained by converting any UPALPHA characters in host to their LOALPHA equivalent (hostnames are case-insensitive), eliding the [ ":" port ] if the port is 80, and replacing an empty abs_path with "/".  </s>
<s> In rfc2068 (3.2.3) we provide a definition of URI Comparison which is probably a better approach.  </s>
<s> Hence I think removal of 'canonical' from the authentication draft will not change the intent and will align the documents.  </s>
