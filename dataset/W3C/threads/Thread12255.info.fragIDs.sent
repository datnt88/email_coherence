<s> I think we should make it clear (as I said in the teleconference - minutes to come as soon as my computer is working again, hopefully in the late morning) what the level of requirement is - prompt the author to provide alternative content means that at some point before publicatin or saving a document, where there are objects without alternatives, the author is prompted at least once to provide alternative content.  </s>
