<s> It is entirely accurate to state that the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the *only* "WAI guidelines" considered by the DRC, do not address them.  </s>
<s> The DRC did not claim to evaluate anything other than WCAG.  </s>

<s> Is this not a failure of EO WG?  </s>
<s> The response from Judy was a defensive one.  </s>
<s> Maybe if EO WG had written the response, and in a way that would be a bit more educational of the WAI's complete set of reccomendations, it would be seen as less of a political nature and more of a clarification of WAI's work on accessibility.  </s>

<s> But, although perhaps "accurate" in its claim, I agree the DRC study &amp; report is misleading if it did not also consider UAAG and ATAG as the complete set of "WAI Guidelines".  </s>
<s> It is very inaccurate to use the term "WAI Guidelines" (upper or lower case G) when only referring to WCAG.  </s>
<s> My scan of the report found the occurrence of the term "WAI Guidelines" 4 times.  </s>
<s> Although the report defines "the guidelines" as WCAG 1.0, it incorrectly and misleadingly introduced the term "WAI Guidelines" when still only referring to WCAG.  </s>
<s> However, my point is not so much the technical terms used or not, the fact that the study didn't also consider the UAAG and ATAG is unfortunate and misleading misleading, Perhaps we could form a "commission" and determine who to blame, but let's learn from what I consider a shortcomings and encourage or demand that future studies include a more holistic view of all of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it is not W3C/WAI's fault that only WCAG seems to find itself in policies and legislation, perhaps the advocacy groups and policy makers have some responsibility to understand that the complete set, all three documents, together when adhered to provide for actual access by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> And, as Judy said: "There is a wealth of interesting policy recommendations in the report, as well, addressing issues such as the need for increased training, improved evaluation practices, and more access to up-to-date assistive technology for people with disabilities -- things which provide an essential supporting context for achieving Web accessibility, but are so often overlooked."  </s>
