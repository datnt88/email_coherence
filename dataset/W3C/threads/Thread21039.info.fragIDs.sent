<s> Danny,  </s>
<s> I'm sure the bug was fixed in the release 7.1.  </s>
<s> I guess your install of the 7.1 didn't work correctly.  </s>
<s> Could you remove all pre-installed versions and retry the install of the version 7.1?  </s>
<s> Happy new year  </s>

<s> Hi Irene, I just de-installed, re-installed and re-started.  </s>
<s> The bug is mostly fixed though I experienced an odd result.  </s>
<s> When I first opened Amaya I still couldn't copy from the 'Open' box at the top of the window and paste into another app (mIRC, TTERM, Outlook): tried both ctrl-c and Edit/Copy.  </s>
<s> However, then I pasted into the document I was editing in amaya, everything worked fine.  </s>
<s> I can't reproduce the original error any more.  </s>
<s> I'll let you  </s>
<s> know if I have more problems.... Best for a Happy New Year,  </s>

<s> Irene: There is a quirk I see in W2K that started with v7: the "Open" text looks as selected when the program starts, even when it's doesn't have the focus.  </s>
<s> This is a bit confusing.  </s>
<s> It looks as if you were enabled to ctrol+X to cut it but it does nothing.  </s>
<s> It works after moving focus to the Open field.  </s>
<s> Also, BTW, I've found a way to move the focus there by using the keyboard.  </s>
<s> Netscape uses ctrol+tab, it might be also ctrol+PgDown.  </s>
<s> This is used to switch from a focus cycle to a different one.  </s>
<s> Saludos!  </s>
