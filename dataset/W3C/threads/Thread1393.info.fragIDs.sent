<s> Julian makes a good point about whether or not white-space is left around as the result of "ignoring" unknown XML elements.  </s>
<s> My personal vote is that when you "ignore" an XML element, you should also "ignore" white space on either side of that XML element.  </s>
<s> JimW: This probably should go on the WebDAV issues list.  </s>
<s> In particular, as part of that issue (or possibly another related issue), we should fix section 23.3.1, so that it no longer makes misleading statements about the XML spec (and preferably, declare that for WebDAV, x /x is equivalent to x/ .  </s>
<s> Julian: If you have a chance to do some interoperability testing with the "unknown element" nested inside of allprop/ , that would be great, since that would give us a basis for fixing 23.3.1 (i.e. without introducing interoperability issues for existing servers).  </s>

<s> Yes, it is :-) That's why I tried to carefully phrase my last reply..  </s>
<s> 2518, a server that didn't understand the DAV:include element must ignore it (and its children).  </s>
<s> So the question then is, what does "ignore" mean?  </s>
<s> In particular, does the result of "ignoring" the include element in: allprop include ... /include /allprop have to be: allprop /allprop or could it be: allprop/  </s>
<s> I'd say, if the request was the result of "ignoring" would indeed be: However, if the request was it would surely be allprop /allprop , which for all practical purposes is the same as allprop/ .  </s>
<s> According to the XML standard, these are equivalent, so either one of these is fine.  </s>

<s> (language-lawyering off :-)  </s>
<s> I feel you're right.  </s>
<s> How do we proceed?  </s>
<s> I've done interoperabilty tests with "our" version of the include element (with mod_dav, IIS and Sharepoint).  </s>
<s> Should I redo them using "your" format before we proceed with one of them?  </s>
<s> Julian: Why would you prefer to have WebDAV extensions defined through the IETF (such as DeltaV and ACL) use their own namespaces?  </s>

<s> Other to make it simpler to find out to which spec a "new" property belongs to?  </s>
<s> No. Right now we have the unfortunate situation that deltaV defines live properties in the DAV: namespace which could apply to base WebDAV as well -- so for an implementor it's not obvious where to find the definition.  </s>
<s> Additionally, deltaV requires a change in the RFC2518-defined behaviour for allprop , which should be defined in the base WebDAV spec instead...  </s>
<s> This assumes that the definition of a property will over time remain in a single RFC.  </s>

<s> If so, the only thing you will be able infer from the namespace of a property is that it was "first defined" in RFC XYZ, but that is of neglible value.  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> That's why I would like to see those moved out of deltaV (and into RFC2518's successor).  </s>
<s> So I believe putting all IETF standardized WebDAV properties into the DAV: namespace is the best approach.  </s>

<s> To beat the horse: mod_dav uses the following algorithm in its propfind: 1) validate that the root element (if provided) is DAV:propfind 2) if no body was provided, or a DAV:allprop child is present in the root element, then the PROPFIND is an "allprop" 3) look for a DAV:propname as a child of the root element; if found, then the PROPFIND is a "propname" style 4) look for DAV:prop; if founc, then it is a "prop" style 5) else fail 6) For a prop style fetch, only the immediate child elements (whether a start element, or an empty element) of the DAV:prop element are used.  </s>
<s> Children of those elements are not examined.  </s>
