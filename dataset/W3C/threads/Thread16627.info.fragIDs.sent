While developing a Web-based virtual tour for an art museum, I have had no difficulty identifying most of the changes in language that occur within a site of this nature. 
However, in addition to French, Italian and other familiar languages, I have also encountered some obscure languages, such as those spoken by tribes rather than nations. 
I've been referring to a list of ISO language codes located at: It does not include certain languages such as Bamileke (Cameroon), Baule (Ivory Coast) and Hemba (Democratic Republic of the Congo). 
Questions for the list: 1. 
Is there a better source for language codes that might include these languages? 
2. If I am unable to find official language codes, what are my options, besides ignoring this Priority 1 checkpoint?

Can anyone explain why a web site developer would choose a server side image map like the one at http://www.metrokc.gov/ 
over a client side image map? 
I am assuming the developer knows accessibility and the requirement for equivalent text links. 
What are the advantages of server side image maps? 
I had always thought that it had something to do with unusual regions. 
But the client side map at http://support.dell.com 
(WITHOUT alt text on the areas) illustrates the fact that you can get as exact as you want with the regions.

You probably should ask the developer of the site. 
:) The main arguments _for_ using server side maps are: 1. Funky shapes and other custom coding (you can actually get pretty detailed if you want to for reason, but in most cases you won't want to) 2. Backwards compatibility -- at one time, only "new" browsers supported server side maps, but that time was about 4 years ago The main arguments _against_ using server side maps and _for_ using client side server maps: 1. 
No way of encoding accessibility information via alt in server-side 2. Faster processing because it doesn't have to make a server roundtrip with client-side 3. Client-side can be used in offline browsing situations just fine, because doesn't need access to server 4. A lot easier to make and maintain client-side maps, from the webmaster's perspective 5. Client-side works great in all current browsers including Lynx 6. Server-side maps require additional, redundant textual links which are not required for client-side maps (but they are still a good idea) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Hi Jim, You have a reasonable point, there is no reason to use a serverside imagemap in the King County example you cite. 
Serverside imageamaps are used for one of two reasons: 
1. Historical - serverside images were common before browsers supporeted imagemaps. 
This has not been the case for quite a while. 
2. Dynamic content - when the resulting link is based on "computations", it needs to be server based. 
The common example of this is linkshare programs Hope this helps.

Thanks very much David and Kynn. 
I summarize your arguments for server side maps: it is historical - it used to be done that way. 
Bottom line - no reason. 
I don't buy computation or "funny shapes" because any funny shape can be fit to pixel width by a polygon. 
But, David, guess I ought to ask what is the "linkshare program."

Hey Jim, I guess I have my head in the sand thinking of old times again. 
I was thinking of the old banner exchange programs (before ad servers took over). 
But, it looks like ad servers no longer use imagemaps of any kind. 
Never mind.... dc David M. Clark 16 Harcourt Street, #2I Boston, MA 02116 david@davidsaccess.com

3. As a fallback for browsers that don't support client side maps.
