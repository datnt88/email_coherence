Won't it be a Lot of Work to define something which is SGML-Like but does not require a DTD? 
I had presumed that XML would be defined like this: "An XML document is a valid SGML document which..." Absolutely not. 
Check out out clause #8 in our current "design goals" statement (http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/dd-1996-0001.html). 
(By the way, the content of that document is fair game for arguments, it's not written in the stars). 
But at the moment it says that the XML spec has to be formal and concise, and not exceed 20 pages. 
It doesn't seem fair to tell someone who wants to write an XML spec that first he has to understand the SGML spec, then a set of deltas. 
Yes, I think it's possible to come up with a rigorous formal specification for XML in something that size, and (here is the hard part) make the documents it generates a strict subset of those generated by 8879 rules.

I had presumed that XML would be defined like this: "An XML document is a valid SGML document which..." I didn't understand that, and I don't think that Clause #8 makes that clear. 
Please consider this a request for an update to that document. 
I think that it is an admirable goal, but as I said before, it looks like a lot of work. 
Even the HTML spec references SGML, and HTML is a simple, fixed markup language, not a meta-language (or "extensible markup language").
