Here's the question that came up in todays conf call. 
Lets say an author defines some id's like 
"old" "new" and then sets up a style sheet to color text corresponding to "new" and "old". 
You then have color used for meaning, violating wcag. 
Say you want to do the right thing, and assign a meaning to these id's, something like titles or captions. 
Ideally this would be a declaration assigning titles to id's. 
But I don't see anything like that in CSS. 
You could kluge something by putting descriptive text at each instance, and making it invisible or visible depending on the style sheet, but is there any good sway to do it? 
Or does CSS make it easy to set up visual styles but impossible to directly assign meaning to them to them?

aloha, len! one could always use CSS' @media types [1] to provide alternative equivalencies... the easiest and most obvious example (at least to me) would be to use @media aural to provide aural equivalents for the color changes in the example you outlined... gregory References [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html#media-types He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.

No, not IDs. 
They want to repeat the colors for all new and old items on the page. 
They can't repeat IDs. 
So they add 'new' and 'old' as values in CLASS="token, token, token" on the new and old elements. 
Then the style selectors pull up and match class=old or class=new to set colors. 
"old". 
The way I read the WCAG it doesn't say color cannot be meaningful. 
It just says that there has to be another way the meaning is communicated if there is meaning to the color. 
Typically, browsers use color to distinguish visited from non-visited links. 
This is exposed in CSS by a system-generated property. 
Here, the plain English meaning of the CLASS value is an equivalent for the sense of the color. 
The class token is a good name for the meaning. 
Using 
'old' and 'new' as CLASS values and then keying the colors to those classes is as close as CSS comes to giving color a verbal meaning. 
I am sorry this got discussed as abuse. 
This is about the highest and best 
use of css we have figured out to date. 
The meaning CSS assigns directly is the presentation behavior. 
The way to have a verbal common reference point for the visual and aural styling is to use good mnemonics as the class names in the HTML that the styles select on.

"old". 
I guess old and new are class names. 
You violate guidelines if you use ONLY color for meaning because it is difficult to notice when the user is colorblind or the device does not show color. 
I'm not sure what this means. 
I think an id or class is an attribute already assigned to an element. 
Depending on the element type the element may have different other attributes available, such as title or captions. 
The id itself is not usually an element and have attributes. 
I wonder if RDF could be used to attach metadata for a class? 
CSS just has selectors for elements (e.g. for classes) and can attach presentation for the elements that are selected by the selectors. 
The meaning is in author's head when he dividing elements in his document into different classes.

"old". 
AG: As Marja said, RDF has capability in this direction. 
The practice I am trying to get people to consider for this purpose is to include the definitions of CLASS values in a resource which is pointed to by the PROFILE reference in a META element in the HEAD of the document. 
In particular, suppose you want to use Dublin Core definitions for publishing attributes and Modern Language Association definitions for the classes of text that are used in deriving style distinctions. 
HTML 4 doesn't know what to do with a second PROFILE reference, so a separate glossary of markup terms written in RDF would be a good way to make the usage in the current document clear.

But does the User agent have access to those names? 
And even if it did, wouldn't it be better to have access to descriptions that are independent of the names? 
Otherwise, it would be like having mnemonics as file names for images instead of ALT text.

Also, re the objection to the subject line here, "css abuse" did not mean 
that css was abusive. 
It just meant that someone could abuse css to 
violate the guidelines, just as they could misuse practically any valuable 
feature. 
Still, it shows I better stick to more sober subject lines in the future.

This is an example of what we call "the better fighting against the good." 
Having _more_ that the natural language associations of the class name or file name to go on is better, but using clear mnemonics as file names and class tokens is still good. 
The file is not only accessed through references in IMG elements. 
In the IMG element, it can have a ALT attribute for explanation. 
In a file directory listing, the ALT is nowhere to be found. 
At this point, there is value in a mnemonic file name. 
It is also easy for an URL to get moved around separately from any referring HTML. 
For this reason, the file name (or URL embedding the file name) should be as mnemonic as it can be on its own terms. 
Where this file is cited in an IMG tag the mnemonic quality of the URL does not relieve the author of responsibility for documenting the use of this image in this place with ALT text. 
In this case the schema linking class names to more elaborate definitions is a dream of the future. 
The ability to inspect the attribute values has been with us in some form or another in essentially all browsers for as long as there has been a Web. 
And yes, a UAGL-conforming user agent not only has access to these attribute values, but makes them available to the user and to add-on assistive technologies.

For this version of A-Prompt, we won't be looking at what's in the style sheets. 
I think we've got enough to do just implementing the WAI guidelines 
in the HTML doc itself. 
For the next version we will check them. 
I hope that there's not very much the page author can do in the style sheet 
to create inaccessible pages.

The ERT document and A-prompt are independent I think. 
A-prompt doesn't have to implement everything in ERT.

There are definitely things that people can do in the stylesheet that express semantics that got left out of the markup. 
Failing to review the author's stylesheet along with the HTML is a functional shortfall, or a failure to do better, or some such thing. 
In the example cited if there are color differences and nothing else visible that marks the alternatives as different, then the colorblind individual is out of luck. 
Only by detecting the color difference in the stylesheet could A-Prompt discover this violation. 
The CLASS names that are in the HTML are sufficient. 
Unless the author also provides a B&amp;W stylesheet with alternate treatment of the color-coded distinction, the document as shipped is broken as regards access. 
As Len was saying, the tool can't really evaluate whether the CLASS names 
capture the content of the styling or not, without having the author manually review the CLASS names themselves. 
This is recommended. 
There should be prompting in the authoring process which explains to the author that the style names should be expressive, not merely convenient. 
This is probably beyond what A-Prompt can do, but just as a spell checker has access to a dictionary and will usefully suggest words you might have meant, styling will not be accessible until the whole style management infrastructure gets the author engaged with received corpora of good style such as the Chicago Manual of Style or the Modern Language Association style guide for journal articles. 
There are two levels of challenge the author's style naming should be subjected to: a) does the name of the style (actually the CLASS token in the HTML, but this is what would appear in the author tool as the selector for styling) state the reason why this portion of the content is styled this way? 
If not, fix it. 
b) Is there a more general rationale that suffices as a rationale for this styling? 
If so, relax the class to the more general class so that it is more likely an alternate-media stylesheet will deal with this class already. 
Al 
Yes, they are independent and the ERT can contain much more that what is implemented in A-Prompt or Bobby. 
We would like to finish the first version of the ERT document soon. 
I'm afraid that if we open up the CSS issue now, we may not get the document done for a very long time. 
The WAI page authoring guidelines do not cover CSSs very well. 
We may want to ask that group to look at CSSs to find what is inaccessible with them before we start working on the repairs.
