<s> Image interpretation should be part of the visible, visually accessible text of any context in which the image appears.  </s>

<s> Hi, I think when it comes to alt text we need to be very specific about what images require alt tags and what does not (bear with me - this will eventually make sense in context of this discussion).  </s>

<s> This is the point I think Kynn was making.  </s>
<s> If the image is used to present information that is presented elsewhere, then its function as an image is purely ornamental, thus see point 1.  </s>
