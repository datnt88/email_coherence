Hi, 
A while ago I came across issue 36 of the British magazine Web Pages Made Easy, which contained an anonymous article on "Building Accessible Web Sites" (pages 16-21). 
The first page is filled with a wheelchair symbol, so I hoped that, at last, mainstream computer magazines were beginning to devote some attention to web accessibility. 
However, the article discusses only usability and hardly mentions any guidelines or techniques for making web sites accessible for people with disabilities. 
Here's an summary of the 
guidelines in the article: 
* Keep it simple; don't cram too much in your home page. 
* Keep pages small (less than 50k; speed of download). 
* Ban splash pages and intros. 
* Stick to standards (e.g. blue underlined text for hyperlinks and nothing else): - visitors should not be required to learn new ways of working every time they visit a Web site - no text in images (resizing does not work) * Keep URLs short; avoid tildes, dashes and underscores in URLs. 
* Chop large texts into small sections (max. 
300-400 per page). 
* Implement site search. 
* Don't assume that visitors are experts (novice users may panic when asked to install a plug in). 
* Combat link rot. 
* Test your site. 
4 testers will find 75% of all usability problems. 
Two out of thirteen links in the links section are about accessibility. 
Issue 37 of the same magazine contains an article on "Make an accessible site", which also contains the wheelchair symbol. 
The anonymous author states that: "Site accessibility is all about building pages that are clearly organised and easy to navigate. 
The principle behind building an accessible site actually relies on sticking to some fairly simple rules. 
You'll need to keep a keen eye on creating a fairly minimalist page layout and aim for Web pages that load in a flash." 
The bulk of the article is a series of screen shots with comments that show how you can use Fireworks and Dreamweaver to create an "accessible" page. 
The article also contains the following tip: "If you are creating pages where you need to include graphical content, it is always a good idea to create a 'text only' version of the same document, with a link to it from your main site. 
This at least then gives the visitor an option to view this more accessible page." 
I think this kind of articles doesn't do a good service to web accessibility. 
What do you think?

Hi Christophe, summary: The first article you mention sounds more good than bad, but not very good. 
The second article you mention sounds more bad than good. 
I haven't read them, so that's as much as I have to go on. 
Some more detailed thoughts: I think giving people the idea that it is good to make a text-only 
version of a site, in any introduction to accessibility, is a bad idea. 
I normally like the work that UsableNet do, but I am perturbed by the advertising that goes with their product for making a text-only site - just as I have been worried about how similar products are used. 
It isn't that a text-only site is an inherent bad thing, it is just that it only improves accessibility for a very small minority of people with disabilities, and it is in my opinion generally a poor choice for where to put effort. 
On the one hand, "no publicity is bad publicity", and anything that raises people's awareness of accessibility as an issue can be helpful. 
On the other hand I think the time has passed when that was the primary goal. 
Sure, there are people who still don't really understand why it might be an issue. 
What is important is a reasonable explanation of how to make things accessible, along with a recognition that this is a field in development. 
Some things are clear, some things are under discussion. 
Anything that gives a set of instructions should note which is which, or at least that the discussion exists. 
This is important. 
I suspect we all agree that alt attributes on images are a good thing for accessibility. 
I am certain we disagree on how important they are compared to other accessibility features - in part because we each tend to start with a particular target audience in mind, whether that is people with intellectual disabilities, people who have very low vision (what some people call "legally blind"), people who are deaf, or people who are all three. 
Prioritising for the universe isn't an easy task. 
Yet there is broad agreement on a number of important accessibility features that should be included in the Web. 
There is disagreement on whether some things are accessibility features or just useful in general (which has an impact because of the political nature of accessibility requirements in many places) and there are plenty of topics still under discussion.

Hi Charles, Someone told me off list that they complained to the publishers about the first article. 
It turned out that it had originally been called usability, but changed to accessibility because they thought that their readership would not understand the term usability.
