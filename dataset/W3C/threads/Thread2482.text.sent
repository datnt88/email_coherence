Subject: Issues-list item "DISPOSITION" Issues-list item "DISPOSITION" From the Memphis minutes: -- Content-Disposition will be added to the Appendix, as one of a group of common MIME headers about which implementors should be aware; Koen Holtman will draft the addition. 
Here is a draft of the addition. 
This text is based on 1806 and on messages in the mailing list archive. 
I have not tested this myself. 
19.6.2.x Content-Disposition The Content-Disposition response-header field has been proposed as a means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user requests that the content is saved to a file. 
This usage is derived from the definition of Content-Disposition in RFC 1806. 
content-disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type *(";" disposition-parm) disposition-type = "attachment" | disp-extension-token disposition-parm = filename-parm | disp-extension-parm filename-parm = "filename" "=" quoted-string disp-extension-token = token disp-extension-parm = token "=" ( token | quoted-string ) An example is The receiving user agent should not respect any directory path information that may seem to be present in the filename parameter. 
The filename should be treated as a terminal component only. 
If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-stream content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response as..' dialog. 
We still have a discrepancy on the delivered filename. 
In general the MUA tries to name the current stream based on the URI. 
This leads to unknown file types on the client system. 
Based on messages in the archives, maintainers are concerned that this will be compounded by groupware users and others who want to share common files but the files are generated or retrieved by an engine and not a straight URI. 
[snip the security section] I'm not sure what we should do about these. 
Should we repeat them in the security considerations section of 1.1, or is that not necessary? 
IMHO, we should put these concerns in 1.1. 
Since the MUA is acting our behalf, shouldn't it obey a variant of the first law of robotics? 
Koen.

"Beware Geeks bearing GIFs" Author Unknown Kevin J. Dyer: Subject: Issues-list item "DISPOSITION" Hmm, this seems like an new problem to me, which is not solved by content-disposition current practice. 
The idea of the DISPOSITION appendix is to document current practice only, not to solve new problems. 
I think WEBDAV is chartered to solve new problems like this one. 
Koen. 
It's not.
