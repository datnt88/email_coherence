I had an action to report on the results of testing I did with form labels some time ago, to help determine if we can deprecate WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 10.2 (until label supported in user agents, position form controls properly). 
The results of this testing are at Mozilla 1.2, Opera 7, Lynx 2.8, JAWS 4.5 on IE6, and WindowsEyes 4.2 on IE6. 
All on the Windows OS unfortunately. 
The conclusion I would draw is that the two screenreaders provide support for the label element when used with the "for" attribute ("explicit" label s). 
Part of my test file was a ridiculous test in which all the form controls were at the top of the page and all the labels at the bottom, to make sure no positioning heuristic was confounding the results - and the screen readers still found them. 
One wouldn't expect the graphical browsers or Lynx to provide any special support for finding the label (though the three graphical browsers did provide the expected support of putting the focus on the form control when the label is clicked). 
My feeling is that this means it is now appropriate to deprecate Checkpoint 10.2.

Hello Michael, the conclusion I would draw from this is that you are not equipped to do sufficient testing, unless WCAG is prepared to recommend that people use Windows (with the implications about buying computers for which it is available, ...). 
Your results are great, but I don't think they justify your conclusion at this stage.

Fair enough. 
It's true that I don't have access to non-Windows platforms for testing. 
However, the test file is in the bugzilla entry so others can pick up where I left off.
