Howdy. I've got a small issue with this option. 
Given the following file test.htm: 
hello If I execute: tidy --hide-endtags true test.htm 
I'll get back: hello And similarly for large files - it strips off the html and body tags. 
Any suggestions? 
// tim You didn't cite a target HTML version, but the DTD for HTML 4.01 has, for the HTML and BODY elements: ...which indicates that both the start and end tags for those elements are optional. 
Therefore, I'm not clear as to what you prefer. 
Is your issue that the option should be renamed to reflect the omission of *all* optional tags, and not simply optional end tags, or that HTML Tidy should omit optional end tags but not optional start tags? 
In other words, do you recommend renaming the option and keeping the current behavior, or do you prefer that Tidy instead generate: hello for your test case? 
-- Dave Hmm, interesting question. 
Perhaps for this option the end-tags shouldn't be removed if the start tags are also optional. 
In this case the start and end tags are jointly optional, but not separately. 
And then an option could permit removal of _all_ optional tags. 
Or, at least that would solve this particular problem. 
Thank you for replying.
