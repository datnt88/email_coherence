Forgive me for entering this discussion so late, but I have been away from this list since mid-April. 
I read through the archive and was surprised by some of the discussions. 
For what it's worth, here're my two cents: 
As for Priority 3.3, I read it to say that you should use a stylesheet for 
layout vs. elements such as B, I, FONT, etc. 
As far as I'm concerned, as 
long as you avoid those elements, you've met this priority. 
If you want to 
make text red, use a stylesheet or the style attribute rather than the font 
tag. 
If you can live without the B, I, etc. tags, and you don't feel that 
you need a stylesheet, I don't see that Priority 3.3 requires one. 
What, a 
blank one, just for looks? 
Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. 
Perhaps it could be better phrased, but why on earth would anyone want to require a stylesheet if a document doesn't need one? 
As for Priority 5.3, it is clear to me that tables may be used for layout in the interim (until stylesheets are better implemented) provided they still make sense when linearized. 
I read several times that you can't have a triple-A site if you use tables for formatting the page. 
I don't see it. 
Where does it say that in the Guidelines? 
Also, several comments seemed to imply that this was an either/or proposition (either tables or a stylesheet). 
Why? 
Stylesheets are very useful for controlling font size, color, style, weight, text-decoration, line length, etc. Tables are currently a necessary evil on most sites because stylesheet positioning is not well implemented yet. 
I use stylesheets for everything but positioning (and even for some types of positioning, like indentation) and a big, simple table for layout. 
It linearizes just fine. 
It's not ideal, but as far as I'm concerned, it meets the Guidelines. 
And it degrades gracefully when the stylesheet is not utilized. 
Finally, Priority 11.1 clearly covers the above situations. 
It says to use W3C technologies when they are "available and appropriate for a task." 
So if I'm designing an intranet site for Netscape 3 only, I'm certainly not going to waste my time with a stylesheet. 
Similarly, if I'm designing for the web, but stylesheet positioning is not implemented well enough to use, then it is neither "available" nor "appropriate for the task" yet. 
When it becomes so, I will upgrade my sites accordingly. 
I find it interesting that so much commentary has been devoted to the above (non?) issues while several (to me) more perplexing problems have gone unmentioned. 
I will bring those up in separate messages to permit individual threads.

As someone who claims that the use of tables to control layout is incompatible with stylesheets, I agree with Charles that it does not conflict in presentational control. 
But the use of tables for layout control is incompatible with the use of stylesheets for layout control, as recommended in the CSS specification. 
I also agree that it is possible to use the 11.1 checkpoint to argue that use of stylesheets for layout control is not currently an option. 
Pesonally I would therefore use less layout control.

I don't have a problem with avoiding wholly deprecated elements. 
Unfortunately, by my reading, 3.3 is stricter than this. 
To follow this checkpoint I would also have to give up all occurrences of ALIGN=CENTER/RIGHT attributes. 
That is too much of a sacrifice for me!

owever I don't think you have to give up those attributes, you just have to use a style sheet as well.

Are you asking that the author use both strategies (attributes and style sheet). 
Otherwise, don't we return to the problem that older browsers can't handle CSS.

So we have the same problem of old browsers not being able to read it. 
Folks, considering that my department is full of old PC486 machines, I can't just pretend this is not an issue. 
Wayne If you choose to use both at the same time, you create an additional usability risk. 
Assume for a moment that your choice in font size and face presents a readability issue. 
For example, lets say it's Times Roman and it's set to -3. 
It is hardly reasonable to expect an average reader to use the browser agent's font size/face changing ability to fix your screwup. 
I would suggest that expecting an average reader to change the fonts and then turn off a style would be sadistical. 
That would be way beyond the ability or desire of the average surfer.
