This turned up on Solaris 2, with tidy built using gcc. 
The parser has trouble with a comment between a " tbody " and a " tr ", and likewise with a comment between " /tr " and " tr " within a TBODY. 
It causes a Segmentation Fault when tidy_out() tries to print a DISCARDING_UNEXPECTED message with a string whose address is 0. Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "../fault2.html" 
line 10 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected -------- Example HTML document -------- Thanks for the useful tool. 
John Just as a FYI, it is not crashing on the Mac OS version. 
Here is the error output I am getting from the test case above (using the 26th July 99 sources ) : Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "comment in tbody .html" 
line 9 column 3 - Warning: discarding unexpected "comment in tbody .html" 
appears to be HTML 4.0 1 warnings/errors were found! 
Here is the cleaned output : title Comment in `tbody' before a `tr' causes Segmentation Fault /title Regards, Terry This is an oversight on my behalf. 
The fix is to add the following into ParseRowGroup in parser.c 
at line 1481 just before the code for discarding unknown tags: /* deal with comments */ if (node- type == CommentTag || node- type == ProcInsTag || node- type == AspTag) InsertNode(rowgroup, node); continue; Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org
