<s> Is there a way to raise a tooltip onfocus?  </s>
<s> if not, why not?  </s>
<s> if I asked this already, apologies I forgot.  </s>
<s> Jonathan Chetwynd  </s>
<s> Tooltips are not themselves directly controlled by HTML, because they are user-interface widgets tacked on ad hoc by user agents.  </s>
<s> Some browsers have chosen a tooltip UI widget of exposing existing (meta)data.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer, for example, has applied tooltips to the "alt" attribute for images, and the "title" attribute for everything else.  </s>
<s> But there is nothing in the HTML or DOM spec that defines how to control the display of tooltips per se.  </s>

<s> Matt, not sure if you are following this thread at wai-ig.  </s>
<s> in any case, my concern is that if a UA does some action on mouse event, it should be/is a standard that this is possible via an alternative input such as keyboard.  </s>
<s> As I think you will realise, I'm unclear as to why you mention HTML.  </s>
<s> could you please explain?  </s>
<s> Even more seriously how are we to reach a consensus about this type of issue, unless it is discussed somewhere.  </s>
<s> can you suggest where this would be more properly discussed?  </s>
<s> writing individual bug reports is unlikely to be effective and are frequently ignored if they call for something that has not been standardised.  </s>
<s> for instance sound on event.  </s>
<s> thanks jonathan  </s>
<s> Jonathan, UAAG 1.0 satisfies your requirement: it requires that *any operation of the user agent* be do-able through the keyboard.  </s>

<s> Ian, The recommendation is there, we seem agreed that the implementation is not difficult, however the reality is that no one knows of a browser that exhibits this behaviour.  </s>
<s> As stated to wai-ig, it is not so much this example as the 'process' that may be faulty.  </s>
<s> W3C groups are recommendation focused, and implementation is left to bug reports.  </s>
<s> Where is the discussion group that draws attention to a failure in understanding?  </s>
<s> It is very hard to imagine how this slipped through the net*, and yet it did.  </s>
<s> People with severe learning difficulties have individual and particular needs.  </s>
<s> We will need excellent channels of communication in order to implement recommendations to their benefit.  </s>
<s> thanks Jonathan *apologies this may be a UK soccer/football expression referring to something that was overseen.  </s>
<s> Developers read this list, so this is one place to start.  </s>
<s> And we talk with developers during teleconferences or in person.  </s>
<s> So this may be the most appropriate W3C list for your bug report.  </s>
<s> However, it may be necessary to send a bug report to individual vendors.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the UAWG can only enter into discussion with developers; we have no enforcement powers.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> We have already heard positive feedback from developers about our test suite.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a test for this feature can be added to it.  </s>
