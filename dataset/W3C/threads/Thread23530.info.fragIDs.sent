<s> 2. (DOM Level 3) NameList.contains  </s>
<s> takes a "str", although NameList.contains  </s>
<s> takes a "name".  </s>
<s> Maby NameList.contains(in  </s>
<s> DOMString name) would be more adequate here.  </s>
<s> Regards, Kasimier  </s>
<s> This one seems a bit late to do it but maybe.  </s>
<s> The parameter was renamed to match DOMStringList.contains(str), following an issue brought but the DOM TS effort:  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Too late is not ok ;-)  </s>
<s> Ok. Greetings, Kasimier  </s>
<s> Well, the current implementers of DOM Level 3 Core that are participating in the Working Group were against changing the method name at this stage of the W3C Recommendation track.  </s>
<s> So there is no plan to change the method name.  </s>
