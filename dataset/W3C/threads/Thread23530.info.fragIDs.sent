Hi, My five pence on naming: 
1. "LSSerializer.parseURI" should be renamed to "LSSerializer.parseFromURI" - analogous to "LSParser.writeToURI" 
(I remember that it was changed from "LSParser.writeURI") 
2. (DOM Level 3) NameList.contains 
takes a "str", although NameList.contains 
takes a "name". 
Maby NameList.contains(in 
DOMString name) would be more adequate here. 
Regards, Kasimier 
This one seems a bit late to do it but maybe. 
The parameter was renamed to match DOMStringList.contains(str), following an issue brought but the DOM TS effort:

Hi, 
Too late is not ok ;-) 
Ok. Greetings, Kasimier 
Well, the current implementers of DOM Level 3 Core that are participating in the Working Group were against changing the method name at this stage of the W3C Recommendation track. 
So there is no plan to change the method name.
