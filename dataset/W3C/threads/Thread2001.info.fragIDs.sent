Hi all, I will be running an HTTP Futures birds of a feather session at the WWW4 conference next week. 
At that time, I would like to have the various groups working on bits of HTTP/1.1 to explain to people (i.e., me) how they intend to proceed, maintain communication with the other groups, and feed the results back into the main draft(s). 
Speaking of which, this would be a good time for our new co-Chair Larry Masinter to explain what on earth I am babbling about.

Excuse me! 
I think it is quite unreasonable to expect that an unofficial gathering of folks interested in HTTP expect to hear from 'various groups working on bits of HTTP/1.1' about how they plan to proceed. 
First of all, 
the groups aren't formed yet and except for those of us who were in Dallas at the 2nd HTTP session, the group proposal is still unknown and possibly even rejected. 
Perhaps this should have been private mail to Larry Masinter asking if he would be available to introduce the concept and poposed time-line.

I don't care if it's reasonable or not -- it is simply how I would like to run the BOF. 
It is my BOF, my time, and my effort -- not a WG meeting -- and I would prefer to have the discussion reflect the actual plans of the WG. 
Why is that bad? 
Would you prefer that I just say the HTTP WG doesn't know what it is doing? 
No, it was a reminder to the WG Chairs that they needed to get the information on the list NOW (which Larry and Dave promptly accomplished) before I gave two separate presentations on the topic next week.
