Hi. I've downloaded amaya-4.0.tgz &amp; amaya-3.2.1.tgz and tried to compile on NetBSD 1.5, but it failed because HTML.S was (and maybe other *.T *.P files were) missing. 
Am I supposed to write those files by ourselves? 
Or can I find them in the net? 
Thanks.

All these files are in the source tar file. 
I guess you just omitted to create a object subdirectory Amaya/$your-object-directory and to move into this directory to launch "../configure".

Hello. 
Thanks for the advise. 
Sorry that I didn't read the web page precisely. 
And I am also found another problem with compiling HTMLedit.c. 
It failed with the messages something like: in function 'UpdateAtom': HTMLedit.c: 
2720: called object is not a function. 
The problematic line is: win = XtWindow (XtParent( XtParent (XtParent (frame)))); # The build succeeded &amp; and the binary displayed the # W3C site pretty well when I commented out the line. 
This happened with both Amaya 3.2.1 &amp; Amaya 4.0. 
I use NetBSD-1.5beta 
(i386) and lesstif, and I have little experience in X Window programming. 
I hope I am not asking a silly question again.
