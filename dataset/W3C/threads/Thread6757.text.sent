Hi, The usual QA and grumpy rant ;) about Guide to the W3C XML Specification ("XMLspec") DTD, Version 2.1 This document is not HTML or XHTML valid :). 
Please could you make it valid. 
Thank you very much If you need help, tell me. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- Hmm... I thought tidying it would fix it, but now I get these: * Line 14, column 25: Error: ID "AEN1" already defined * Line 12, column 25: Error: ID "AEN1" first defined here * Line 286, column 40: Error: required attribute "alt" not specified * Line 817, column 27: th width="31%" align="LEFT" valign="TOP" XML specification Error: value of attribute "align" cannot be "LEFT"; must be one of "left", "center", "right", "justify", "char" and so on with lots of LEFT vs left problems.

I think running it through the stylesheets again will fix it, too. 
Or most of it. 
The AEN IDs are a dead giveaway that the HTML was created with Jade in the pre-XSLT days. 
Be seeing you, norm Norman.Walsh@Sun.COM | Doubt is to certainty as neurosis is to XML Standards Engineer | psychosis. 
The neurotic is in doubt and has XML Technology Center | fears about persons and things; the psychotic Sun Microsystems, Inc. | has convictions and makes claims about them. 
In short, the neurotic has problems, the psychotic has solutions.--Thomas 
Szasz Sorry folks, that document is *really* old. 
I think the sources may even be in SGML (need to check). 
I will try to get the HTML output compliant, but it may take me a few days to look into this.
