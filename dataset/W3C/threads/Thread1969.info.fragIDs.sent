Its time to revise the charter for the HTTP working group, to bring it into line with the group's planned activities. 
The following reflects my understanding, as HTTP-WG chairman, of our current work commitments. 
To avoid us slipping into bottomless discussions about life, the universe and everything, can you please limit your comments on the charter revisions to things that the group has already discussed. 
The existing (and sadly out of date) charter is at: Now that HTTP 1.0 is done, We are currently focussed on two major areas: HTTP 1.x and HTTPng. 
HTTP 1.x is work on extending the current MIME based protocol, while HTTPng seeks to replace this with a much more efficient protocol, with a smooth transition between the two. 
Current Milestones: o HTTP 1.1 Internet Draft during November 1995 o HTTPng Internet Draft + code and test data for March 1996 Additional milestones are needed for revising the Digest Access Authentication proposal, and for work on HTTP 1.2 (see below). 
The HTTP 1.1 work is limited to: 1) Persistent, stateless connections when client asks and server agrees o Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, valid Content-Length 2) Cache control and a consistent caching algorithm o Cache-Control, URI, better descriptions 3) Preemptive content negotiation o Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Accept-Charset 4) Reactive content negotiation o 300, 406 responses 5) Protocol switch header o Upgrade 6) Methods to support client-server capability negotiation 7) Methods to support user agent authoring and collaboration o PUT, DELETE, LINK, UNLINK, LOCK, GETLOCK, UNLOCK, PATCH 8) A method to support message encapsulation o WRAPPED 9) Digest Authentication - the Digest Access Authentication proposal will be revised for submission as a candidate for an experimental RFC. 
Third party digest authentication will be deferred to future work 10) Proxy improvements o Forwarded, Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization o 407 response, and a new response for "Use Proxy" 11) Defined semantics for metainformation o Title, Link, Base, Content-MD5, Content-Language, etc. 12) Support for resource versioning o Lock, Version, Derived-From, Unless (a general-purpose IMS) HTTP 1.1 is intended as a fast track specification. 
Any features that fail to make the cut for 1.1 will be considered for an HTTP 1.2 specification. 
This is likely to include work on standard mechanisms for extending and upgrading HTTP transactions. 
The HTTPng work is initially limited to: 1) Fixing HTTP's poor performance over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections 2) Providing greater control over delivery of information between clients and servers, including out of order delivery of data and much more efficient content negotiation facilities. 
HTTPng achieves this aim by a compact binary encoding and by encoding of header information into contexts that are preserved across requests, and a design which allows for streaming of requests and responses. 
Out of order delivery and priority control is enabled by using a multiplexing transport, with an initial implementation of the protocol over TCP.

I have two additions to the list: - Accurate statistics in spite of caching: schemes to let proxies communicate hit counts and other statistics for cached resources to the origin servers. 
- Request-id (which is different from the State-Info proposal by Dave 
Kristol). 
Request-ID would be an optional header (or optional part of the From header in some variants), send by clients, to allow accurate clicktrail analysis on server logs, even if the clients are behind proxies or firewalls. 
I don't care much for this idea myself, but I can't recall that we reached consensus in this discussion. 
(We did reach consensus on the need for Request-id and State-Info to be two separate mechanisms.) 
These things were discussed extensively on www-talk in July, for example in the `3 Proposals: session ID, business-card auth, customer auth' thread.

Very important question. 
I we omit this, lot of webadmins will stuff in Cache-Control: no-cache into responses to have hit counts etc. 
This may turn current internet brownouts into blackouts.
