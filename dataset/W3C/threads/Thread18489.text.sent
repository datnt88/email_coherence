Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443 
Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do everything through the mouse. 
Discussion: a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings specified by the author? 
b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events through the keyboard benefits the user? 
7.Definition Issues: 1.Issue 359: Definition: text content (incompatible with WCAG?) 2.Issue 358: Definition: Equivalent 3.Issue 322: The definition of the word element 4.Issue 321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of checkpoint 2.3 Open Action Items 1.IJ, EH, AG: Propose new definitions forterms in question (equivalence, text element, etc.) 2.IJ: Coordinate usability testing of the guidelines (JRG volunteers to be one of the testers). 
Source: 3.JG: Talk to Al Gilman at the next WAI CG meeting about a joint meeting with UA, PF, and Voice WG (or participants) to discuss accessibility issues. 
Source: 4.JG: Send screen shots of directional techniques Source: 5.JG: Implementation information for guideline 2 6.JG: Propose text for the techniques document about synthesized speech implementation issues. 
Notably UA and AT wanting to use the same synthesizer engine. 
7.JG: Create issue list for things that need to be addressed in the next version of the document 8.JG: Request input on the resolution of issue 454 Source: 9.GL: Ask someone from Microsoft whether they will evaluate the guidelines with a product. 
Deadline: one week. 
Source: 10.GR: Review checkpoints in Guideline 10 for implementation information 11.JA: Review checkpoints in Guideline 4 for implementation information 12.MQ: Send more details about control of speech parameters for the techniques document based on OpenBook. 
(deadline open) 13.KB: Submit technique on providing information on current item and number of items in search Completed Action Items 1.IJ: Add these resolutions for issue 324. 
Source: Resolved: Will be part of next working draft 2.IJ: Add IJ proposed checkpoint for character set API support for issue 324 Source: Done: 3.IJ: Ask Philippe Le Hegaret about read only suport for DOM style module and alert the WG Source: Done: 4.IJ and EH: to review the definition of "presentation" to possibly drop URI-dependencies. 
Done: 5.IJ: Implement "environment conventions" changes per resolution of Issue #450 Source: Done for next draft 6.IJ and EH: Work on definition of "animation" that identifies "animated image" as a special case. 
Also talks about script effects, style sheets effects, markup languages as being able to create animations. 
(Blinking not part of animations...?)

My comments on the agenda issues are included inline - search for CMN... 5.Issue 458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an image map? 
What is required granularity? 
Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#458 
CMN Highlighting should be possible for each region. 
Visually it can be very difficult to make out what is active otherwise. 
I am not sure if this is as important as a P1 issue (it depends on how easy it is for nominally visual users to actually tab through the links or otherwise find out what they all are) but it definitely rates as a P2. (It is repair for poorly authored image content, but unfortunately there is plenty of that around, and likely to be for a long time, since creating good communicative images is difficult and we can expect people to get it wrong as often as they have for the last fifty years). 
6.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse) specific events. 
Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443 
Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do everything through the mouse. 
Discussion: a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings specified by the author? 
CMN Well, we require the user agent to ensure that the device-specific things can be done device-indepedently. 
I guess that means a repair. 
(Thisprobably involves some careful thinking - it is possible that a very simplistic search/replace repair will in fact break well-designed content). 
b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events through the keyboard benefits the user? 
CMN Well, it is popular enough for screenreaders to routinely provide it. 
Use case: a link that only works as an onclick - form submission, stupid popup windows, etc. Use case: Rollover or click functions that cause a menu to appear, which is necessary for navigation. 
This is something I have seen on many major sites, including those of participants in this working group. 
Again, it is a repair function. 
Sigh. 
Maybe User Agent developers will be the ones to convince authoring tool developers to get their act together and stop generating so many things to be repaired. 
Open Action Items Deadline: one week. 
Source: CMN Deadlines that are a date are probably easier to figure out Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Fortunately, our astute Chair put the link to the source of the action item, the 25 January 2001 teleconf. 
I'll let you calculate from there. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 I know. 
It was a very low-level comment that recording these things as dates in the future means we don't have to rely on the fact that our chair is astute enough to make sense of these things. 
Slightly more relevant to the list than "It's really warm and sunny here in Melbourne right now", but only slightly. 
It just occurred to me in passing, and seemed like a small habit shift that could be easily accomplished. 
(and something I should remember to think about too) Chaals Fortunately, our astute Chair put the link to the source of the action item, the 25 January 2001 teleconf. 
I'll let you calculate from there. 
- Ian Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Charles, The original request to add the source URI was that some people wanted context information for their action items. 
I was not adding the source to indicate the deadline in particular, but to allow people to reference the discussion that generated the action item. 
This sometime included a deadline. 
Adding deadline information is also useful and I will try to add that information in the future if people request it to be included. 
But the more information to keep track of manually the more time it takes and increases the chance of mistakes between agendas. 
What is really needed is a action item tracking tool similar to the issue tracking tool used by UA, we may have one soon, cross your fingers.
