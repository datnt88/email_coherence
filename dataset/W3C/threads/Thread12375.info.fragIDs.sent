<s> Hi Phill, this seems like an issue that belongs in another WAI group, but I can't think of which one.  </s>
<s> If I do I'll send them a pointer to this thread.  </s>
<s> As I see it, Dublin Core are trying to categorise any resource available on the Web, and less and less of those will be HTML.  </s>
<s> So the fact that a Dublin Core statement duplicates an HTML attribute doesn't seem to be a problem - in fact if the information is in the HTML it should be easy to extract it for making accurate (or at least consistent) Dublin Core metadata, or take it from the metadata and include it in the page encoding.  </s>
<s> The same applies to the potential overlap between either of these and information provided by an HTTP header.  </s>
<s> So I propose a Technique for tools to meet WCAG checkpoints 13.2 and 4.3, for ATAG checkpoints 1.3 and 3.2: (applicable to all except programming tools, I think.  </s>
<s> Images don't often have a language, but audio often does...) If identifaction of the language of a document is available from any of + The document's markup (eg xml:lang attribute in XHTML, SVG, SMIL and others) + The HTTP headers of a document obtained from the Web + External metadata about the document, such as Dublin Core information propose the value to the value to the author (suggested, but necessary if there are conflicting values obtained) and use it for all of the above which are applicable.  </s>

<s> I'm chasing his email address.... Liddy  </s>
<s> Hmm. This isn't the forum to ensure that happens, but my personal perspective on this is that it is unlikely to happen.  </s>
<s> HTML/XML and Dublin Core are used primarily in different ways.  </s>
<s> There are some overlaps, because there are some features that are useful in both situations.  </s>
<s> But generally developers say things like "why should I have to parse Dublin Core information in RDF when I am really only trying to find the language of the document that my XML browser is presenting?", or "having to look inside a document for one piece of metadata tat I need for cataloguing, and build a seperate parser to do so, is precisely what we wanted to avoid by using Dublin Core".  </s>
<s> If you are suggesting that IBM would generally prefer to have the ability to parse both types of information, or that this is what you recommend to them, and believe that you could get some reasonable level of industry buy-in, then I would suggest going with the metadata solution as the preferred one.  </s>
<s> However, I think that is unlikely, and that in order to support the different use cases without requiring everyone to build massive pieces of software it is more useful to produce the two redundant forms.  </s>
<s> Just to illustrate, let me take an example where things are much closer together already.  </s>
<s> In EARL, each statement (or grop of statements) must include the date of the statement.  </s>
<s> If EARL is stored as an annotea annotation, then part of the informationthat the annotea system includes is a date.  </s>
<s> Both pieces of information are RDF, of type Date.  </s>
<s> It is an open question whether to make earl:date a type of dc:date or not - many implementors do not want to have to import the entire dublin core namespace as that requires extra features on their parsers.  </s>
<s> (Here, I think that people will settle for opening the namespace - particularly if we harmonise the work on DC.accessibility and earl soon enough...) just my 2c worth.  </s>

<s> lang is an attribute defined for a particular language.  </s>
<s> xml:lang is predefined for all xml languages.  </s>
<s> So normally if you want to do something to have an attribute that describes the natural language content of its host element, xml:lang would be the smart way to go.  </s>
