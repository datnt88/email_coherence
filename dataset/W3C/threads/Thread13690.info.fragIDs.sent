<s> Only if the CSS sheet is to be used on a multitude of devices.  </s>
<s> If the device is known, then absolute units can be used.  </s>
<s> Please note that em etc. can be used for widths etc. as well, not just for font-sizes:- .navbar  </s>

<s> I think it's very important not to allow absolute sizes for fonts in style sheets.  </s>
<s> Although Netscape 6 and Opera 4 will resize text even when there's an absolutely defined size, all other browsers that I know of won't and you get frozen text.  </s>
<s> The ability to override the stylesheet doesn't help since it's impossible to predict in advance what elements and classes would need to be overridden.  </s>
<s> My approach to designing style sheets is to assume the browser's base font size is 12 point.  </s>
<s> I base all sizes off of that as either a percentage or an em/en.  </s>
<s> This is both resizable and, if the browser's base size is different, everything will still be correct with respect to that.  </s>
<s> I wish it were possible in CSS to define the preferred base size you're working with (as a single absolute size that could easily be overridden), but it isn't, so we're stuck relying on the browser's.  </s>

<s> There is a thing called constraint-based CSS.  </s>
<s> It was done to solve problems like "I want all fonts to be at least 33pt", and it was implemented - it is essentially a few extensions to CSS I think.  </s>
<s> We could look at that, or we could ask PF to push it again...  </s>

<s> I guess that only makes sense if CSS were expressed in XML though.  </s>
