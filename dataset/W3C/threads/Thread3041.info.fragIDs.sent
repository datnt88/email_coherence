Unless I missed something, we haven't heard about who is going to chair this potential WG. 
So far the questions put on this mailing list (a request for information on the chairs, or a repeat of the reading list) have gone unanswered. 
This does not bode well for an active group. 
I'm interested in becoming very actively involved and offer support to this WG, but having just heard about it I also don't have any information on who is else is involved, the exact charter, etc. ..Christopher Allen Consensus Development Corporation.. ..

My aplogies: as list administrator, I did not realize that Jeff Schiller's announcment of Win Treese as chair did not get sent to the list (because jis@mit.edu is not a subscriber, it was bounced; I have fixed the list to accept anyone now).
