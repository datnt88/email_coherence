<s> So far the questions put on this mailing list (a request for information on the chairs, or a repeat of the reading list) have gone unanswered.  </s>
<s> This does not bode well for an active group.  </s>

<s> My aplogies: as list administrator, I did not realize that Jeff Schiller's announcment of Win Treese as chair did not get sent to the list (because jis@mit.edu is not a subscriber, it was bounced; I have fixed the list to accept anyone now).  </s>
