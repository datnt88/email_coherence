<s> I propose that WCAG 2.0 introduce the notion of a conformance profile, as defined below.  </s>
<s> In practice this would involve only a minor adjustment to the conformance scheme as specified in the latest working draft.  </s>
<s> A conformance profile specifies the level at which conformance is claimed (1, 1+, 2, 2+ or 3).  </s>
<s> In the case of level 1+ or level 2+, the conformance profile must also include a list of checkpoints (beyond level 1 or level 2, respectively) to which conformance is claimed at a higher level.  </s>
<s> A conformance profile may be provided either in text or as metadata.  </s>
<s> A conformance claim must include a conformance profile, either directly or via a link.  </s>
<s> The possibility of linking to a conformance profile offers the flexibility inherent in this proposal that conformance profiles can be specified separately from the conformance  </s>
<s> claims that refer to them, for example by policy setters.  </s>
<s> This should  </s>
<s> also simplify the author's task by allowing a link to be used in place of a complex (inline) conformance profile.  </s>
<s> The term "conformance profile" may, but need not, itself be used in the guidelines, as long as the substance of the proposal remains clear.  </s>
<s> We should also provide sample conformance profiles corresponding, as approximately as practicable, to the three WCAG 1.0 conformance levels, together with any other profiles that are deemed desirable.  </s>

<s> Two comments: 1.  </s>
<s> This has been superseded by RDF/EARL: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/  </s>
<s> 2. The proposed PICS ratings for levels 1+ and 2+ don't specify which checkpoints have been met beyond level 1 in the first case and beyond level 2 in the second.  </s>
<s> Thus they don't constitute a complete or accurate conformance claim, because someone reading this claim wouldn't know which checkpoints were involved.  </s>
<s> That is why I specified in my proposal that at levels 1+ and 2+ the relevant checkpoints have to be identified in the profile.  </s>
<s> I think this same concern also underlies Ian's objections to the wording of the conformance section of the current draft.  </s>
<s> Due to an editorial oversight, it wasn't made clear that unless one is claiming conformance at one of the three levels, the additional checkpoints implemented at a higher level have to be listed.  </s>
<s> I think text and EARL should be the preferred methods of making claims.  </s>
<s> Ok... so we need to define using these...  </s>
<s> Hum... at this point this could cause confusion...  </s>
<s> The real claim could be done only if every web site that requires the claim submit a form in the W3C web sites where declare the point that are soddisfed so at the end of the form will be assigned a UIN (unique identification number) for the claim for this web site.  </s>
<s> This will guarantee that the web site owner by himself check the points and claim that his web site pass these points.  </s>
<s> So, when from his web page he link to the W3C conformance page, he could do this like: So will be shown the claim reached by this web site (1, 1+, 2, 2+, 3) and - if intemediate level, will be shown the checkpoint of intermediate level.  </s>

<s> You should strike 'text' from that list.  </s>
<s> In its place a  </s>
<s> literate-programming binding of the EARL model for ease of reading is very  </s>
<s> strongly suggested in this case, or better yet three of these.  </s>
<s> Let me use more standard terms.  </s>
<s> We should follow the model/view/controller precedent set by XForms and say that EARL provides the model for conformance  </s>
<s> claims, and that text claims should be created by a binding to that model.  </s>
<s> The details of the binding must be available as suporting resources for the [hyper] text form of the claim, with an indication in the text-form-of-claim instance as to how to recover the details of the binding.  </s>
<s> Compare with XAG 3.1.  </s>
<s> For 'stylesheets' here read 'presentation bindings' in the spirit of the binding language of XForms.  </s>
<s> These could likely be defined by their implementation in XSL as transforms to VoiceXML, to XHTML, and to XForms-in-SVG for those who have problems processing text encoding.]  </s>
<s> Plain text in any natural language is inaccessible to speakers of other languages, including sign and symbol languages that we should not so lightly disenfranchise.  </s>
<s> Note that their preference for that language is closely related to personal characteristics that are commonly termed disabilities.  </s>
<s> Plain text without any asserted binding to [something approximating] the EARL model fails to meet the standards set forth in the XAG and in this case what William says (that the principles transcend XML encoding) is true.  </s>
<s> More specifically, one key use of the detailed claim is as metadata supporting selection of resources appropriate to an individual user.  </s>
<s> This central use is dependent on the machinable binding to the detailed and standardized conformance model.  </s>
<s> So plain text does not meet the need.  </s>
<s> There must be a readily reconstructed binding of the language used in any text claim to a formal accounting scheme supporting tracing to the terms of the standards applied.  </s>
<s> And the W3C preferred -- and a readily implemented -- way to do that is with XML syntax that conforms to the principles evident in the XAG draft.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Of course you are right.  </s>
<s> I just got the XML2002 website cleaned up in fact.  </s>
<s> Some of their pages contained a DOCTYPE of HTML 4.0 and the icon said 4.01.  </s>
<s> When I reported this, rather quickly the webmaster changed things so they match.  </s>
<s> This is a group that appreciates the value of conformance.  </s>
<s> But there have been too many scams where all that you are assured is that you get what you get.  </s>
<s> The system has to make the confirmation check easy for the few who are skeptics in order for the "many eyes" or "bazaar" effect of the web to protect the many who are too busy to check.  </s>
<s> The W3C is weak on enforcement.  </s>
<s> Accessibility may indeed remain the spear point in setting precedents where W3C/QA will eventually follow.  </s>
<s> But we also  </s>
<s> need to form a coalition with the XML community who care about valid stuff in mounting the validity campaign.  </s>

<s> I agree to your action.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is also due especially for the developing of accessible web sites for Public Administration Campaign launched by EU that have endorsed the WCAG 1.0 Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The problem is that a lot of developer don't knows the guidelines and they claim the reach of an accessibility level (1, 2, 3) using only validation tools like Bobby: if they see the logo "Bobby Approved", for example, they don't check the "priority user check" and this could be done in good faith or in bad faith (more accessibility level could mean more money from Public Administration... and we need to find something for control this wrong "accessibility business" because as i wrote in my previous message, a wrong logo usage could cause wrong emulation in web developers.  </s>
<s> also  </s>
<s> I agree in this.  </s>
<s> Is important not only to set the reccomandations but also have a support for grant the right use and mantain good quality for the logos.  </s>

<s> While I agree with Al in principle, I would also expect resistance from those who aren't competent in the use of metadata, or who have the concerns of such authors in mind.  </s>
<s> As a result we will probably  </s>
<s> have to allow textual claims as is customary, though continuing to  </s>
<s> emphasize the advantages of Earl.  </s>
<s> A set of supplied Earl to XHTML/SVG etc., XSLT transformations would help to ease the transition, too.  </s>
<s> my two cents: Meta data is the way to go, if people can not write meta data, a simple online form can be made to help the author it.  </s>
<s> (I will volunteer if necessary) Meta data allows for meta data searches, so that users can find the content that they can use.... But, different users have different requirements - if I am colorblind, I care about the perceivablity a lot more then if alt tags are filled in.  </s>
<s> So searchers and categorization should be supported at a checkpoint level, and even a known technique level In other words meta data should specified conformance at: * an overall level (as with EARL) * checkpoint level, * and at a known techniques level This is not so difficult - we just need a URI for each technique and checkpoint I am not suggesting that authors have to stipulate every checkpoint, however if some accessibility fetchers are supported beyond the overall conformance level of the page, the author should be _able_ to tell the audience who need it most.  </s>
