I propose that WCAG 2.0 introduce the notion of a conformance profile, as defined below. 
In practice this would involve only a minor adjustment to the conformance scheme as specified in the latest working draft. 
A conformance profile specifies the level at which conformance is claimed (1, 1+, 2, 2+ or 3). 
In the case of level 1+ or level 2+, the conformance profile must also include a list of checkpoints (beyond level 1 or level 2, respectively) to which conformance is claimed at a higher level. 
A conformance profile may be provided either in text or as metadata. 
A conformance claim must include a conformance profile, either directly or via a link. 
The possibility of linking to a conformance profile offers the flexibility inherent in this proposal that conformance profiles can be specified separately from the conformance 
claims that refer to them, for example by policy setters. 
This should 
also simplify the author's task by allowing a link to be used in place of a complex (inline) conformance profile. 
The term "conformance profile" may, but need not, itself be used in the guidelines, as long as the substance of the proposal remains clear. 
We should also provide sample conformance profiles corresponding, as approximately as practicable, to the three WCAG 1.0 conformance levels, together with any other profiles that are deemed desirable.

Good. 
I think we could use these that was discussed years ago: Using: ((PICS-version 1.1) 
(rating-system "http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag20-conformance") (rating-service "http://www.w3.org/WAI") (icon "wcag1A") (name "W3C WCAG 1.0 Conformance level") (description "The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Conformance level Rating System.

Content providers are solely responsible for the use of these logos. 
") (category (transmit-as "c") (name "WCAG Conformance level") (label (name "Level 1") (value 0) (description "All Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied") ) (label (name "Level 1+") (value 1) (description "All Priority 1 and some Priority 2 checkpoints are satisfied") ) (label (name "Level 2") (value 2) (description "All Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are satisfied") ) (label (name "Level 2+") (value 3) (description "All Priority 1, 2, and some Priority 3 checkpoints are satisfied") (label (name "Level 3") (value 4) (description "All Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints are satisfied") This content must be put in the file: Then, as in the old message, the usage in the pages will be the follow: meta http-equiv="pics-Label" content='(PICS-1.1 "http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag20-conformance" labels exp "2002.12.31" for "http://www.foo.com/foo.html"

ratings (c 1))' / So, as for other pics services, is possible also to archive the declaration of conformity. 
This is also important because i think there is a need of a service that could be contacted if some DOC ("Declaration of Conformity") are considered not correct (this for assure the web developer to have not wrong "examples" of accessibility level reached). 
"Conformance profile" is good.

Two comments: 1. 
This has been superseded by RDF/EARL: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ 
2. The proposed PICS ratings for levels 1+ and 2+ don't specify which checkpoints have been met beyond level 1 in the first case and beyond level 2 in the second. 
Thus they don't constitute a complete or accurate conformance claim, because someone reading this claim wouldn't know which checkpoints were involved. 
That is why I specified in my proposal that at levels 1+ and 2+ the relevant checkpoints have to be identified in the profile. 
I think this same concern also underlies Ian's objections to the wording of the conformance section of the current draft. 
Due to an editorial oversight, it wasn't made clear that unless one is claiming conformance at one of the three levels, the additional checkpoints implemented at a higher level have to be listed. 
I think text and EARL should be the preferred methods of making claims. 
Ok... so we need to define using these... 
Hum... at this point this could cause confusion... 
The real claim could be done only if every web site that requires the claim submit a form in the W3C web sites where declare the point that are soddisfed so at the end of the form will be assigned a UIN (unique identification number) for the claim for this web site. 
This will guarantee that the web site owner by himself check the points and claim that his web site pass these points. 
So, when from his web page he link to the W3C conformance page, he could do this like: So will be shown the claim reached by this web site (1, 1+, 2, 2+, 3) and - if intemediate level, will be shown the checkpoint of intermediate level. 
This could be the unique guarantee for don't make confusion for the intemediate levels.

[Al, here] 
You are assuming that W3C is certifying the claims, when you say "the real 
claim." 
The way one encodes the substance of the claim (EARL) is independent of who says it is true, and how one says that they really say it 
is true (XMLDSIG). 
We should separate certification issues from representation language issues. 
Yes, if the W3C has signed a copy of the conformance report either as 'seen' or 
as 'corroborated' that signature will serve as a sufficient key to retrieve the 
report if you query the W3C authority as to "What was in the document that you 
signed thus: (publicKey, digiSig)?" 
Assuming that W3C has agreed to serve as such a repository. 
But this would be done using standard signature techniques which leave us free 
to use what language we wish for the expression of the claims being signed. 
And the architecture of the Semantic Web is such that one doesn't need a central authority compiling a registry. 
The entire URI namespace is the index space of Web storage, and the claim as seen and signed (by whoever, no 
matter who) can be served from anywhere and the signatures will confirm the 
authority of the assertions with high confidence. 
The issue as to whether or not W3C would take on the role of a certifying authority is a matter that I should perhaps defer to the Director of the International Program Office (Judy). 
However, the WCAG group can and should 
create the expressive language so as to be completely independent from any certification process assumptions. 
EARL (check me here, Wendy) has been designed to be usable in the absence of 
any certification process and pre-existing trust relationship with an audit 
and certification activity. 
It links the claims with a description of the 
actual conformance checks performed so that a third party receiving the 
claim can readily confirm or deny the claims for themselves.

You should strike 'text' from that list. 
In its place a 
literate-programming binding of the EARL model for ease of reading is very 
strongly suggested in this case, or better yet three of these. 
Let me use more standard terms. 
We should follow the model/view/controller precedent set by XForms and say that EARL provides the model for conformance 
claims, and that text claims should be created by a binding to that model. 
The details of the binding must be available as suporting resources for the [hyper] text form of the claim, with an indication in the text-form-of-claim instance as to how to recover the details of the binding. 
Compare with XAG 3.1. 
For 'stylesheets' here read 'presentation bindings' in the spirit of the binding language of XForms. 
These could likely be defined by their implementation in XSL as transforms to VoiceXML, to XHTML, and to XForms-in-SVG for those who have problems processing text encoding.] 
Plain text in any natural language is inaccessible to speakers of other languages, including sign and symbol languages that we should not so lightly disenfranchise. 
Note that their preference for that language is closely related to personal characteristics that are commonly termed disabilities. 
Plain text without any asserted binding to [something approximating] the EARL model fails to meet the standards set forth in the XAG and in this case what William says (that the principles transcend XML encoding) is true. 
More specifically, one key use of the detailed claim is as metadata supporting selection of resources appropriate to an individual user. 
This central use is dependent on the machinable binding to the detailed and standardized conformance model. 
So plain text does not meet the need. 
There must be a readily reconstructed binding of the language used in any text claim to a formal accounting scheme supporting tracing to the terms of the standards applied. 
And the W3C preferred -- and a readily implemented -- way to do that is with XML syntax that conforms to the principles evident in the XAG draft. 
Al 
Of course you are right. 
I just got the XML2002 website cleaned up in fact. 
Some of their pages contained a DOCTYPE of HTML 4.0 and the icon said 4.01. 
When I reported this, rather quickly the webmaster changed things so they match. 
This is a group that appreciates the value of conformance. 
But there have been too many scams where all that you are assured is that you get what you get. 
The system has to make the confirmation check easy for the few who are skeptics in order for the "many eyes" or "bazaar" effect of the web to protect the many who are too busy to check. 
The W3C is weak on enforcement. 
Accessibility may indeed remain the spear point in setting precedents where W3C/QA will eventually follow. 
But we also 
need to form a coalition with the XML community who care about valid stuff in mounting the validity campaign.

PS: Roberto, as AC rep you will want to be campaigning WAI for the ER group

Talk to Wendy and Judy and you will

Thank u :-) 
4.01. 
I agree to your action. 
My suggestion is also due especially for the developing of accessible web sites for Public Administration Campaign launched by EU that have endorsed the WCAG 1.0 Guidelines. 
The problem is that a lot of developer don't knows the guidelines and they claim the reach of an accessibility level (1, 2, 3) using only validation tools like Bobby: if they see the logo "Bobby Approved", for example, they don't check the "priority user check" and this could be done in good faith or in bad faith (more accessibility level could mean more money from Public Administration... and we need to find something for control this wrong "accessibility business" because as i wrote in my previous message, a wrong logo usage could cause wrong emulation in web developers. 
also 
I agree in this. 
Is important not only to set the reccomandations but also have a support for grant the right use and mantain good quality for the logos. 
I have also seen something in the QA (http://www.w3.org/QA/). 
Tomorrow will start the three days AC Meeting and i follow it in IRC... i hope that could be possible to discuss also about this.

Ok... i talk with the "WAI girls" .-) 
While I agree with Al in principle, I would also expect resistance from those who aren't competent in the use of metadata, or who have the concerns of such authors in mind. 
As a result we will probably 
have to allow textual claims as is customary, though continuing to 
emphasize the advantages of Earl. 
A set of supplied Earl to XHTML/SVG etc., XSLT transformations would help to ease the transition, too. 
my two cents: Meta data is the way to go, if people can not write meta data, a simple online form can be made to help the author it. 
(I will volunteer if necessary) Meta data allows for meta data searches, so that users can find the content that they can use.... But, different users have different requirements - if I am colorblind, I care about the perceivablity a lot more then if alt tags are filled in. 
So searchers and categorization should be supported at a checkpoint level, and even a known technique level In other words meta data should specified conformance at: * an overall level (as with EARL) * checkpoint level, * and at a known techniques level This is not so difficult - we just need a URI for each technique and checkpoint I am not suggesting that authors have to stipulate every checkpoint, however if some accessibility fetchers are supported beyond the overall conformance level of the page, the author should be _able_ to tell the audience who need it most. 
I do not know if EARL support this, but I could not find it.

Yep, EARL supports point-by-point conformance statements to any set of points that each have a URI. 
That means you can give a URI to double-A conformance, and have a one-line statement. 
You can add conformance for any particular checkpoints above that. 
People can describe the checkpoints they need for their own use, and search for things that are described in EARL as meeting that particular set of checkpoints. 
EARL, because it is RDF, can readily understand that if you meet WCAG level A then you meet checkpoint 1.1, and other such obvious requirements. 
And you can query EARL and then get a text statement or logo.
