<s> As you may have noticed from the CVS notification system, I've been rather active polishing the documentation for the Markup Validator today.  </s>
<s> In spite of a very tight schedule (between a flurry of national holidays and an overseas trip) I am inclined to release v0.6.5 of the Markup Validator tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Rationale: - Most of the issues regarding navigation are, I believe, sorted out; - Most validation / broken links issues have been sorted out, too; - I am now fairly happy with the source/install/devel documentation; - Coordination with W3C Commm is going well and they are ready to announce the release; - I am aware that some problems (may) remain, but we're likely to have to do a corrective release in a few weeks however long we take before this release.  </s>
<s> If we're serious about trying to release often, this is the time to prove it; ... and we haven't made a release in a very, very long time.  </s>
<s> That said, if you think there is any important reason *not to* release, please say so rapidly.  </s>
<s> Ville, I gather you may want to update validator.spec.  </s>
<s> The syntax is  </s>
<s> not so complicated, but I failed to understand some of its subtleties.  </s>
<s> olivier  </s>
<s> Tomorrow sounds even better now, since the CSS validator has (somehow by mistake, I had forgotten to tell Yves I was working on the hTML files) been updated and now sports the new style/interface.  </s>
<s> Will be nice to update both services around the same time.  </s>
<s> I am still struggling with last-minute issues and decisions... Bjoern  </s>
<s> pointed out that changes I had made today was breaking a well-known  </s>
<s> behaviour (clicking on a label should usually select the button, not go to another page), so I reverted that.  </s>
<s> I also changed the default to non-verbose on the homepage interface, though I think it's OK to leave it preselected for the advanced interface and revalidate box.  </s>
<s> Your opinions welcome by tomorrow, and in any case, none of all this is cast in stone.  </s>
<s> Below is my - proposed - compiled changelog for the announcement.  </s>
<s> Opinions on this much welcome.  </s>
<s> General - new style, new (simpler) navigation mechanism [ shared with CSS validator ]  </s>
<s> - Bug tracking system now officially supported - updating and expanding catalog of supported character encoding and document types Features / Bug fixes - additional explanations for error messages in "verbose" mode - contributed by the www-validator community -. - new fallback mechanism when doctype or charset is missing - fixed broken markup output bugs - internationalization improvements, other small fixes Documentation - FAQ (NEW, added to the help page) lists a lot of the usual validation problems - installation documentation (NEW) makes it much easier to install the markup validator locally - user and developer's documentation (UPDATED) olivier  </s>
<s> (It also breaks keyboard navigation to some extend as you would select the checkbox, then the label, then the link, etc.)  </s>
<s> It would somehow suggest that the results you got in the first place already *are* verbose and there is no point in re-validating it.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> had similar issues with, AFAIR, the show source checkbox, as it was unchecked and yet it showed the source.  </s>
<s> I think we should not announced that this is "shared" with the CSS Validator.  </s>
<s> I for example get the german version of the CSS Validator by default which is not updated and it's currently a bit unfinished...  </s>
<s> We should probably also point out that this is more a maintenance release than The Next Generation.  </s>
<s> Indeed, forcing source display is yet another "love it or hate it" why it was done in the first place made sense any more since snippets of code are given with the errors.  </s>
<s> So I removed the override.  </s>
<s> I'll  </s>
<s> note, as David said on w-v today, that all this would indeed be easier  </s>
<s> if we could record users' preferences.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> Yes. olivier  </s>
<s> The changes in content look mostly good to me.  </s>
<s> I've fixed some bugs  </s>
<s> XHTML 1.0 Strict (== no "name" attribute for those elements).  </s>
<s> There are  </s>
<s> quite a few places in the docs and the script output where this breakage occurs ATM.  </s>
<s> The above must definitely be fixed before releasing IMO.  </s>
<s> Yeah, it's fairly simple, usually just changing the version numbers and URLs that point to the tarballs is enough.  </s>
<s> The only new thing that needs attention now is that a relative URL is used to point to /source/, instead of the old "hardcoding" of v.w.o/source/.  </s>
<s> That's not a good thing for local installations, for example the tarball links will definitely be broken in those.  </s>
<s> I'll work around this in the spec now, and will make an educated guess where the validator tarballs will be available for download when they are... (hint, hint :)  </s>
<s> I've fixed some bugs here and there  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I realize I really shouldn't code like I did, especially when so tired :)  </s>
<s> Oops.  </s>
<s> That's right.  </s>
<s> Bulk fixed, and I went through most of the documents and output and validated it.  </s>
<s> Looks good, but still cross-checking.  </s>
<s> Should not be a problem if the actual links to the tarballs are absolute and pointing to v.w.o, right?  </s>
<s> I changed the ones I had  </s>
<s> forgotten.  </s>
<s> ... or the other way around.  </s>
<s> I'll name them after what you named them (and the naming scheme is pretty straightforward) :) olivier  </s>
<s> Sort of.  </s>
<s> But the (local) source, installation etc. docs and the actual online tarballs may easily get out of sync, trivially so if the links point to the unversioned validator.tar.gz and sgml-lib.tar.gz.  </s>
<s> And if they point to the versioned ones there is one more easily forgotten place to keep up to date in the docs at release times.  </s>
<s> I (still) do not include anything from under /source/ in the RPMs, but point to v.w.o/source/ instead.  </s>
<s> A bit ugly, but should always work.  </s>
