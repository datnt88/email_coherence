Dear All, This time it is not a news story, but something much better. 
Check out this link as I think that the BBC has taken a novel approach to inaccessible pages... 
I have only taken a quick look, so apologies if this is not quite what it seems to be at face value.

JKD run anti virus software on all servers and all workstations, they can not be held responsible for any infected files that you may receive. 
JKD advises all recipients to virus scan any file attachments. 
Had a quick look and kind of like the idea. 
Obviously it needs websites to 
download and configure it but in principle semms fine. 
Not sure about one of the points under functionality in the Technical Outline though. 
Apparently it uses yellow fonts on a black background to make it easier for screen readers to read!!!*grin* I'm currently working on a variation on this theme to improve browsing experience which maybe some people might find useful. 
Watch this space. 
Cheers Ian

Dear All, Having taken a longer look at BETSIE and collated comments from a great many sources on this list, it appears that I am somewhat behind the times! 
I would also like it known that I am not a fan of text-only websites and prefer to make content available to all through the same page. 
Having said all that, I think that there is something within BETSIE that could be used more effectively than it is at present, which in hindsight I was trying to show with my post. 
I thank everyone for commenting on the BETSIE articles and I wish everyone working on similar projects all the best for the future. 
Kind regards Simon White

download and 
under functionality  in the Technical Outline though. 
Apparently it uses yellow fonts on a black background to make  it easier for screen readers to read!!!*grin* Yes, it does this by *default*, based on information I received both from the RNIB and the BBC subtitling department, who cited research saying that while in general this was the easiest colour scheme for most people to read, that there were wide divergencies of experience in this area, and so a range of colour schemes should also be provided, with yellow on black as default. 
On the day the version of Betsie with this colour scheme first went live, I received mail from people saying both words to the effect of 'Congratulations for at last choosing a sensible default colour scheme for my visual impairment' and 'You fool! 
Don't you know that we visually impaired people can't cope with such stupid colour scheme.' 
This kind of bears out what the subtitling people and RNIB had told me, and until I hear of a better way around of doing things (or am pointed to new research showing that yellow on black is not the best default), I'll keep it as it is. 
Users can always change the colour scheme, or indeed use their browsers to override the (limited) set of options given by Betsie with their own preference. 
Also, anyone installing their own version of Betsie should find it trivial to change the default colour scheme to something that a majority of their users prefer.

Hi Bob, 
Thankyou for submitting your bug report about the Betsie site / Betsie to the WAI list. 
I have no idea what exactly went wrong because you did not say. 
I'd be very grateful if you could send a more detailed bug report to me, offlist. 
Otherwise I will not be able to fix the problems you have encountered. 
:) Cheers etc., Wayne Wayne Myers Betsie Project BBC Interactive F&amp;L
