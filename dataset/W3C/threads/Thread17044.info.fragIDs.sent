<s> Apparently it uses yellow fonts on a black background to make  it easier for screen readers to read!!!*grin* Yes, it does this by *default*, based on information I received both from the RNIB and the BBC subtitling department, who cited research saying that while in general this was the easiest colour scheme for most people to read, that there were wide divergencies of experience in this area, and so a range of colour schemes should also be provided, with yellow on black as default.  </s>
<s> On the day the version of Betsie with this colour scheme first went live, I received mail from people saying both words to the effect of 'Congratulations for at last choosing a sensible default colour scheme for my visual impairment' and 'You fool!  </s>
<s> Don't you know that we visually impaired people can't cope with such stupid colour scheme.'  </s>
<s> This kind of bears out what the subtitling people and RNIB had told me, and until I hear of a better way around of doing things (or am pointed to new research showing that yellow on black is not the best default), I'll keep it as it is.  </s>
<s> Users can always change the colour scheme, or indeed use their browsers to override the (limited) set of options given by Betsie with their own preference.  </s>
<s> Also, anyone installing their own version of Betsie should find it trivial to change the default colour scheme to something that a majority of their users prefer.  </s>
