<s> This is NO good behavoure of AMAYA!  </s>
<s> Amaya is (a.o.) provided for testing HTML4 pages.  </s>
<s> If an element, object, style, attributes or whatever is part of this HTML 4, Amaya should at least accept it!  </s>
<s> Once it is accepted by amaya, it can or cannot act on it according to the current implementation.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I think Amaya should also be able to put the element (object...) in the HTML page.  </s>
<s> Once again: acting accordingly is not required.  </s>
<s> Compare this to displaying italics or bold with fonts which do not have such capabilities or displaying colors on a B&amp;W display or even the text only (alternate view) of a page.  </s>
<s> This col in this location should not state 'rejected' but it shoud state 'accepted but not implemented'.  </s>
