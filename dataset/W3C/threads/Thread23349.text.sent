Hi: DOM L3 LS CR spec at contain a small mistake in the description of LSWriter It currently says *Type Definition /LSWriter/* A |LSWriter| represents a character stream for the XML input. 
But it should say that "A LSWriter represents a character stream for the XML output" instead of XML input Regards -Ramesh Thanks! 
Thanks, this has now been fixed in the spec source. 
jst Fixed.
