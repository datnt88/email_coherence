<s> I have not looked in the ANSI guidelines for this, but the access issues for forms are older than the Web.  </s>
<s> There may be some good ideas in the general CHI literature.  </s>
<s> The PA guidelines draft does briefly mention making sure that text entry fields are non-empty initially.  </s>
<s> Another point we were discussing on the GL list recently (but which is not in the draft at the moment) is having description and action (label and control or entry field) on one line.  </s>
<s> This is a bit on the conservative side but it is still a good idea today.  </s>
<s> The next stop on the "back off and gain perspective" track after "read the current line" is to start over from the upper-left.  </s>
<s> You don't want to have to do that too often.  </s>
<s> The examples at Speech-Friendly Search Engine Query Submission Forms are instructive.  </s>
<s> See also Cathy's Newsstand.  </s>
<s> And _tell us_ when you find something better.  </s>

<s> Thanks, that's just the sort of thing I've been looking for!  </s>
<s> Gives me a place to start.  </s>
<s> I had been looking at another version of the Guidelines which doesn't include that information.  </s>
