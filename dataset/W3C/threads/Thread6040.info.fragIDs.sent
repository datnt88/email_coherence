<s> Steve Giving this a bit of thought makes me think that the essence of pub-sub is 1.  </s>
<s> The publisher sets up a service that accepts subscriptions requests and changes for some other service that actually publishes documents/messages.  </s>
<s> 2. The subscriber then requests subscription to a service by sending a messge which then gets either accepted or rejected.  </s>
<s> 3. When the subscriber makes the request, they must include some kind of "delivery address" that identifies where documents/messages etc, generated by the publisher must be sent 4. If the request is accepted, then the publisher will return some kind of "identifier" for the subscription that can later be used when changing or cancelling the subscription 5. The publisher starts publishing documents.  </s>
<s> This is a one-way message although it might be delivered reliably 6.  </s>
<s> The publisher continues publishing documents until: a) the subscription is cancelled, or b) the subscription runs-out, e.g. a certain period of time has passed, a specific number of messages/documents have been received, the subscriber hasn't paid.  </s>
<s> From a CDL perspective, the "delivery address" is what the Overview Model calls a "Channel".  </s>
<s> This means that to use it, we need to have a way of representing the Channel in XML and decie how it should be included in the message.  </s>
<s> My thoughts would be the body.  </s>
<s> The rest sounds to me like a pretty regular Choreography Definition with dependencies, e.g. you can't cancel a subscription unless you managed to subscribe to it successfully.  </s>
<s> Another question is should such a Pub-Sub Choreography be standardized as I am sure the need for Pub-Sub goes beyond WS Chor.  </s>
<s> For example you could imagine a definition that allowed you to manage a subscription to any web service then later cancel it.  </s>
<s> However you would need standard XML docs to be used as Message Content for the Interactions in the Pub Sub.  </s>
<s> Also where should such a spec be developed ... by WSDL, by WS Chor?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I know the answer to that one.  </s>
<s> David How does this leave our stuff wrt the Barros usecase?  </s>

<s> Look at all the "out-*" patterns starting at section 3.4.  </s>
<s> A complete pub/sub solution is not provided, as the address and mechanics of "sub"ing and providing the address for the "pub" to be delivered are not standardized in WSDL (perhaps this is an orchestration problem?).  </s>

<s> Thank you, Ugo  </s>
<s> mm1: I believe someone on this list has already questioned the implications of any open standards' body adopting proprietary specifications.  </s>
<s> I believe that that is certainly one possible approach, and if there were open Web Services eventing standards (meaning open standards body) available at the time that the Event Notification feature were architected it may/may not have been done this way.  </s>
<s> However, would it be possible (or even efficient) to have a subscriber be notified by a Web Service that is external to the registry contents about and event that happened to a RegistryObject within the registry?  </s>
<s> I could be off base, but it seems to me that a more efficient approach is to have the subscription "close" to the contents themselves.  </s>
