<s> Hello, A quote from "HELP FORMS":  </s>
<s> 3. NOTES ON SUBMITTING MULTI-LINE DATA For submitting multi-line data, you may use the following table to get different behaviour from the www4mail server.  </s>
<s> [ First line second line third line last line ] Your data will be submitted to the WEB server as one line with each line separated by %0D0A (the Enter or Return key).  </s>
<s> If you are using the TEXT mode then make sure that the {, ( or [ or {( comes after the = sign on the same line.  </s>
<s> If you use a web browser then make sure that the first character of your entry is the {, ( , [ or {( sign(s).  </s>
<s> www4mail versions 2.2 and 2.4 support this feature.  </s>
<s> Example:  </s>
<s> XBASE=http://www.lena-kiev.f2s.com  </s>
<s> XNOSTAT XFORMREPLY=SOURCE XFORM=form method post action "/displayform.pl" a=[b cd e=f] XSUBMIT_NOW = on XFORM= /form  </s>
<s> Resulting posted string: a=b%0D%0acd%0D%0ae%3Df All is OK, as intended.  </s>
<s> But www4mail version 3.0/pre3.0rc12b  </s>
<s> doesn't support this feature, the [ ] are treated as just data.  </s>
<s> Example:  </s>
<s> XBASE=http://www.lena-kiev.f2s.com  </s>
<s> XNOSTAT XFORMREPLY=SOURCE XFORM=:post::/displayform.pl a=[b cd e=f] XSUBMIT_NOW = on XFORM= /form  </s>
<s> Resulting posted string: a=%5Bb&amp;e=f%5D Second line of content of the textarea lost, third line erroneously treated as separate form field.  </s>
<s> The test script I wrote, installed and used for these examples:  </s>
<s> #!/usr/bin/perl print "Content-type: text/plain\n\nSTDIN: "; while ( STDIN ) { print; } print "\nEnvironment:\n"; foreach ( sort keys %ENV ) { print "$_ = $ENV{$_}\n"; }  </s>
<s> Please reinstate the feature.  </s>
<s> To add "%0D%0A\" at the end of each line in multi-line content of textarea is cumbersome.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Lena  </s>
<s> Dear Lena,  </s>
<s> Maybe it is easier on us all, if you can try to send your data as UUENCODED.  </s>
<s> I hope your mail client supports uuencoding, if not, do consider improving your mail client.  </s>
<s> The newer gateways can handle incoming uuencoded mails as well.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the newer gateways do not support [] for blocking text as it was found to be unstable, However the 3.0 gateways also treat the { } signs in the same way.  </s>
<s> The use of plain text encoding for complex page submissions is not encouraged.  </s>
<s> Intrestingly enough, I do believe that the use of a web browser will generate the right encoding as an email for the www4mail gateway.  </s>
<s> You may choose to try the XJSDUMP with a web browser to obtain the correct encoded strings in a browser window.  </s>
<s> So, you can try to use the { } instead of [ ].  </s>
<s> However, the use of a web browser is recommended.  </s>
<s> Well, the www4mail manuals need a major revision/updating.  </s>
<s> Clement  </s>
<s> #!/usr/bin/perl print "Content-type: text/plain\n\nSTDIN: "; while ( STDIN ) { print; } print "\nEnvironment:\n"; foreach ( sort keys %ENV ) { print "$_ = $ENV{$_}\n"; }  </s>
<s> Lena, Just to say that I have included code to attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the 2.4 gateways with respect to Multi line form data.  </s>
<s> This means that your page should probably work okay with wm.ictp.trieste.it.  </s>
<s> Please kindly test and let me know!  </s>
<s> Other servers could be upgraded when I get your response.. BTW: Your mail client seems to claim that it supports MIME.  </s>
<s> At least it sends a MIME Version header.  </s>
<s> Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
<s> #!/usr/bin/perl print "Content-type: text/plain\n\nSTDIN: "; while ( STDIN ) { print; } print "\nEnvironment:\n"; foreach ( sort keys %ENV ) { print "$_ = $ENV{$_}\n"; }  </s>
