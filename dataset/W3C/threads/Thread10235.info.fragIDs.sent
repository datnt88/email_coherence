<s> And so to the blank URI question: I was reminded obliquely (by a comment about splitting URIs into QNames in Jena) that the folks looking at RFC2396bis (URI spec revision) have raised the issue of how to treat fragments attached to blank URIs.  </s>
<s> Currently, according to RFC2396, #frag is always relative to the current  </s>
<s> document rather than the current URI resolution base.  </s>
<s> This caused us some debate about how to deal with xml:base in RDF.  </s>
<s> The current thinking in the URI group is to replace this with a discussion of (non-) retrieval when a bare fragment is used: 017-rdf-fragment: One cannot use the fragment to indicate relative to a base document, other than to the current document.  </s>
<s> Some want to allow XML parsers for RDF to use base URI+fragment together.  </s>
<s> The proposal would replace discussion in current document with extended discussion of retrieval when base is same as current document.  </s>
<s> There was support for this the floor.  </s>

<s> Note that this issue is a request to change the "current document" algorithm.  </s>
<s> This can be accomplished by changing the spec to remove the bit about current document and instead replace the empty URI with the base URI, later stating that a retrieval action must not take place if the new URI differs from the base URI only by its fragment.  </s>

<s> Er, no.  </s>
<s> In this context, it's a (relative) URI that happens to be an empty string.  </s>
