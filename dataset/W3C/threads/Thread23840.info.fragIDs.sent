Contrary to popular belief, PDFs are often smaller than the equivalent material in HTML. 
Not if you embed fonts... and if you compress the HTML, you'll find that the HTML is usually much smaller. 
But the question was "Is there any possible way to embed a font into a web 
page??" Font embedding does often (but not always) push the size of PDFs over what the plain text or HTML version would be, but the question was 
about typography, not ascii. 
Even if you don't embed fonts, Acrobat's substitution fonts will preserve the layout and much of the style of the source document absolutely. 
If OpenType embedding becomes a reality, the typical size differences between PDF and HTML (rendered pages) will wash out. 
HTML will continue to be the more highly manipulable format, and PDF will continue to be the more powerful presentation medium. 
As for compression, your point is well taken, but the fact is that HTML is not routinely sent down the wire in compressed format. 
PDF is - PDF 1.2 
(Acrobat 3) files can incorporate redundant JPEG, LZW, CCITT and ZIP 
compression. 
With byteserved PDF 1.2 files designed with browsing in mind, the browsing experience can be snappier than with HTML. 
Note that some fonts come with a licence that forbids embedding in Acrobat files. 
This is a very small portion of the fonts in wide commercial use. 
I know of no non-controversial alternatives. 
Do you? 
My point is not that PDF is better than HTML in general, but that it is often unjustly maligned as bloated and suitable only for transmission of print-format documents.

Lee Quinn: 
Todd Fahrner: 
Actually, more and more libraries are finding out about the scale of embedding risks and are changing their end user licenses to forbid it until some reliable technology comes around. 
The FontShop library, FontFonts and Emigre's typefaces, and many other smaller foundries are making clear statements about what can and cannot be done. 
Adobe might be the only one left allowing embedding of their own fonts. 
I wonder what their relationship with their licensees is. 
How Linotype and Monotype think about Adobe giving permission to the everybody to start broadcasting their fonts. 
There must be some tension there. 
Maybe there are no non-controversial alternatives right now. 
That does not mean they cannot be developed, and it does not mean that it is ok to give in to free fonts for everybody. 
There are some possibilities to work with until something really usefull comes along. 
For instance the truetype part of opentype can be used to embed bitmapped versions of the letters, and perhaps some cooperation between some extra embedding bits and authoring software could allow only the bitmaps to be embedded in the document, if the typefoudnry has instructed the fonts to do so. 
This might help control the problem some, it is not a solution. 
I know from many discussions on this list in the past that the idea of bitmapped fonts online is not seen very favourably, compared to quality and flexibility of embedding outline fonts. 
But in the end it depends on what the type foundries are _willing_ to permit what can be done with their typefaces, and bitmaps might actually be all they will allow for the time being.

What is the name of the product that is smaller then Acrobat? 
ENVOY. 
The New 
York Times seems to prefer ENVOY to Acrobat for the Web. 
Acrobat. Get Acrobat 3 set up with your browser and see the examples 
near 
the bottom of http://www.killersites.com/3-pdf/ . 
Contrary to popular belief, PDFs are often smaller than the equivalent material in HTML. 
That sir is an untruth. 
Envoy documents are not smaller than PDF when comparing the same data. 
A simple test, take an Envoy document, print it to file (make a PostScript file), then convert the PS to PDF with Acrobat Distiller, 9 times out of 10 the Acrobat file is smaller. 
As file sizes get larger this is especially true, I've yet to find an Envoy document over 100k that couldn't be made smaller in PDF. 
Make your own decisions, believe the hype or believe the facts. 
As an aside, PDF is probably smaller than HTML as well, when comparing the same/similar data. 
-- Clive 
My understanding is that the NYT was responding to complaints about the printing speed of PDFs on non-postscript printers - not about file sizes. 
Apparently Envoy does better here than Acrobat in some cases. 
Seems to me these issues have more to do with the reader software than the file format. 
How does the Acrobat 3 Reader compare with the latest from Envoy? 
But to address Erik van Blokland's weightier objections to font embedding: you (Erik) assert in your piece online that it is feasible to extract outlines from PDFs containing embedded fonts, and to reconstitute usable fonts with a little work in Fontographer or other editor. 
You go on to 
imply (I think) that big, diversified Adobe is less concerned with this problem than the smaller, specialized shops, that this is a threat to your livelihood specifically and to original type design generally. 
Is this a fair summary? 
Just how feasible is this extraction, exactly, and has anything changed with PDF 1.2/Acrobat 3? Specifically, If I put two PDFs (latest format) on the Web, each containing half the character set of a certain obscure face, how much trouble will it be for you to post a PDF of another text set in that face? 
I honestly don't know how you'll fare. 
(You could cheat, but that would be cheating.) 
If you can do it in much less time than it would take to scan, trace, kern, hint and otherwise refine a few magazine pages' worth of type, you'll have made your point in a very convincing, public way - a service to us all. 
Failing this - after all, who has time for it? 
- could you say a little more about how one steals a font from a (current format) PDF? 
Intrigued by your assertion, I tried once and failed, though I gave up quickly. 
Under which conditions (if any) would hypothetical terrors like FontSucker or FontCrawler fail with current embedding technology? 
Todd Fahrner 
Todd Fahrner: 
Yep. 
Yes. 
Though Adobe is beginning to show signs of understanding the scale of the possible problems. 
Note that Amber has been delayed, and the opentype spec uses the word 'encryption' a lot more. 
I'd be surprised if a really satisfactory solution to embedding would emerge in the near future. 
If it can be done safely, I don't mind, but I have to be convinced before I would allow my fonts to be subjected to some technology that will send my types to potentially millions of people without my control of consent. 
For the time being with current technologies, I just cannot allow embedding the outlines of my typefaces, and I think that bitmaps are ok for the time being, until something better comes along. 
It will provide the possibility of using type on the web, and leaves room for improvement. 
Adobe does a good job making them and designing some new ones as well, but it is not their only (or even biggest) source of revenue. 
I license my typefaces, but I don't have many applications I can sell, nor technology I can make OEM deals with. 
Therefore I have a somewhat different perspective on the problems caused by embedding. 
About 15 minutes work, most of the time dialing in and uploading. 
Some people might be able to do it a lot faster I'm sure. 
Note also in this context that Trudoc fonts (used in Envoy) have already been extracted in about 30 minutes and basically offer no more protection than pdf does at the moment. 
Except for the fact that Trudoc uses a shady semantic trick to get around the copyright issue that will not work outside US jurisdiction. 
Scanning, tracing, justifying, hinting etc. of a normal textface would be several weeks work, doing it badly. 
Finding the font used in a pdf takes a couple of seconds. 
A FontSucker would only be a helper, not an enabler. 
Fonts can be extracted from pdf with simple texteditors under unix or NT, and save with a new extension. 
On mac it can be done even easier, using something like resedit, and some fontapp. 
Anyone with some mac experience can do it if you know where to look. 
Please forgive me for not telling you where in 
an open forum, it's bad as it is already. 
Other people on this list (Lee, Clive?) will be able to confirm this without explaining exactly how. 
Perhaps the kerning info is missing as it is digested in the rest of the pdf document, the rest of the font is certainly most present. 
Adobe's 
subsetting in acrobat only kicks in if less than 10% of the font is used. 
That's 25 different characters in one font or more will cause the whole font to be embedded. 
"The Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" would probably do it. 
FontSucker could even be (perish the thought) a browser plugin. 
It only 
takes 1 nut to write something like that and distribute it in a couple of newsgroups to bring the wonderful of typography to everybody. 
[irony] 
Acrobat 3 apparently is better and lets users determine how much of the font needs to be used in order to be fully embedded, but chances are users won't care much. 
Of course you can have the font subsetted. 
But if it is a popular one I can find other docs with the rest. 
Subsetting is a 
compression method, not a protection scheme.

Yes. Actually I already sent some mail to Todd Fahrner with some slightly more specific details. 
I am not willing to share these. 
I will say that the Unix beta 3 of Acrobat is the lest secure that I have seen. 
It would be difficult to use Acrobat on Unix for more than a few days without discovering that it actually gives fonts away. 
For an Adobe font, you can pick up kerning information by ftp from Adobe's ftp server anyway... 
Ha! Actually I am thinking of starting an ftp site with all of the Adobe fonts available that I can find in PDF files. 
After all, Adobe allows fonts to be embedded, and the reader licence doesn't say you can't extract them, I think. 
Subsetting is a compression method, not a protection scheme.

Erik: 
Lee: 
Er, I hope Lee is making a little joke, whatever he has in the way of extracted PDF fonts still has a copyright notice attached to it. 
So while one *might* (though I doubt it) be able to make a legal case for personally using the extracted fonts, one would certainly be in breach of copyright in redistributing those fonts. 
In effect, just because you can do it, doesn't mean that it is any more legal than stealing fonts in other ways. 
-- Clive 
Erik: 
I agree with everything Erik says (most of the time). 
Getting a font or subset froma PDF is relatively simple for anyone who knows a little about Macs and a little about fonts. 
The process is similar on both Win and Unix. 
I haven't had a chance to really look at Distiller 3.0 and what it does with fonts, at the present time I don't believe that any of the open doors have been closed. 
There is a small light at the end of the tunnel, but not having explored it I cannot yet comment. 
As far as Acrobat is concerned, yes. 
I'd also like to follow-up Erik's point about TruDoc, just as easy to get into, and by default illegal in many states outside the US. 
In fact illegal with some fonts within the US. -- Clive
