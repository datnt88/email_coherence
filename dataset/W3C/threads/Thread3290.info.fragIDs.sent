<s> WRT today's teleconference: What follows is very very brief.  </s>
<s> If people want more details or have specific questions, please let me know.  </s>
<s> African languages fall into four categories: 1) languages supported by unicode.  </s>
<s> E.g. Hausa and Pulaar (using Latin script).  </s>
<s> 2) languages supported by unicode, but require additional support in rendering systems.  </s>
<s> E.g. Yoruba, Ife, Dinka, Nuer, etc.  </s>
<s> This can include correct placement of combining diacritics based on languages' typographic conventions, or stacking of combining diacritics.  </s>
<s> Ife offers a challenging example.  </s>
<s> Some notes under construction that may illustrate some of the issues:  </s>
<s> This is an issue for font rendering technologies (AAT/ATSUI, Uniscribe and Graphite for example).  </s>
<s> OpenType has features (e.g. MarkToBase, MarkToMark) that are designed for correct positioning of combining diacritics.  </s>
<s> Support for this in Uniscribe is currently under development.  </s>
<s> (Not sure of the status of AAT/ATSUI in this regard).  </s>
<s> In some cases: (Dinka and Nuer for instance) the existing combining diacritics for some fonts are adequate for lowercase characters (but not optimal), although entirely unsuitable for uppercase characters.  </s>
<s> In other cases like Ife, where diacritic stacking is required, it is a crucial concern which will be alleviated when the new versions of the font rendering technologies become widespread.  </s>
<s> Additionally, African languages use alternative glyphs for certain characters (most common example is uppercase ENG).  </s>
<s> It is possible to create alternative glyphs for different languages/typographic traditions within an opentype font.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately current software is unable to interact sufficiently with the font rendering systems to allow use of langauge specific features within fonts.  </s>
<s> At least thats my current understanding.  </s>
<s> 3) languages that have some characters that are not present in Unicode.  </s>
<s> E.g. Dagera (Burkina Faso), Hausa/Pulaar/etc.  </s>
<s> in Ajami (Arabic script).  </s>
<s> There has been a fair amount of discussion recently on Ajami on the Unicode-Afrique, A12N Collaboration and H-Hausa mailing lists.  </s>
<s> 4) scripts currently not supported by Unicode.  </s>
<s> E.g N'ko, Vai, Tifinagh, etc.  </s>
<s> With respect to HTML, issues are how to identify languages when there is no ISO-639-1 code or IANA language code.  </s>
<s> How should the "x-" convention be used in practical settings?  </s>
<s> For an example:  </s>
<s> I've use a convention "x-sil-" to indicate an ethnologue language codes.  </s>
<s> Although thats neither here nore there.  </s>
<s> Other key issues include charset identification in the absence of "defined" character encodings.  </s>
<s> A useful starting point is the "A12N gateway" http://www.bisharat.net/A12N/  </s>

<s> Hello Andrew,  </s>
<s> Very nice notes.  </s>
<s> It would be very good to note that at least on the Web, NFC should always be preferred.  </s>
<s> I.e. don't just say U+00E3 U+0300 or U+0061 U+0303 U+0300 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE WITH COMBINING GRAVE But make it clear that U+00E3 U+0300 is the right way to go.  </s>
<s> This will help a lot for low-level comparisons,...  </s>
<s> I checked this one, and it was in NFC.  </s>
<s> But I didn't see a language indication for Dinka.  </s>
<s> Maybe there is no code?  </s>
<s> Don't at least some of these technologies offer the possibility to define glyphs for combinations of characters?  </s>
<s> Also, please check SVG and see whether it contains the necessary mechanisms (it should!).  </s>
<s> A more short-time solution would be to create e.g. a True-Type font for Dinka, which covers all the necessary combinations, and has the right glyph shapes for the upper-case diacritics, and give that font priority in style sheets for Dinka material.  </s>
<s> Again, having a specially-designed font (or some fonts) may be a short to middle-range solution.  </s>
<s> Very good.  </s>
<s> The important thing is to take such discussion (or the results and main points) over to unicode@unicode.org (or even unicore), and to work on actual proposals.  </s>
<s> For some work on the later, please see  </s>
<s> Not at all, if possible.  </s>
<s> [I find the en-AU in h1 xml:lang="en-AU" Nuer test page /h1 a bit too much, but that's a detail.]  </s>
<s> Exactly.  </s>
<s> If the language in question has some ammout of printed works (50 different items to be exact), then you should apply for an iso-639-2 code.  </s>
<s> if the language in question doesn't have that much printed material, you should apply for an IANA code.  </s>
<s> There are no 'undefined' character encodings.  </s>
<s> If somebody does an encoding, they should document it, and register it with IANA.  </s>
<s> It's rather easy to do that.  </s>
<s> But working towards getting the necessary characters into Unicode may be much better use of your time.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hi Martin,  </s>
<s> just a work in progress.  </s>
<s> thanks, i was intending to write up soem notes on using NFC and also on accent ordering.  </s>
<s> Dinka doesn't have a ISO-639-1 langauge code, although it does have a ISO-639-2 code "din".  </s>
<s> The poage was originally a HTML4 page so couldn't use the iso-369-2 language code.  </s>
<s> I haven't looked at SVG, but will.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> AAT/ATSUI ... don'ty know enough about it .. been too long since i've used macs .. but I suspect it should.  </s>
<s> Unsicribe ... there has been ongoiing discussions on some mailing lists, which included soem type designers and soem of the Microsoft staff.  </s>
<s> My understanding at the moment is that the OpenType MarToBase and MarkToMark features should be used, but Uniscribe doesnot currentlky include support for these features for the Latin script (in general), although support was introduced for Vietnamese at soem sdtage.  </s>
<s> I'df have to check which evrsion of uniscribe that was.  </s>
<s> So some people will have combining diacritic support for Diactric/base combinations used in Vietnamese (for soem reason Micrsodt doesn't use NFC or NFD for Vietnamese Unicode input) but no othger diacritic/base combinations in the Latin script.  </s>
<s> As to which users ahve what .. it depends on 1) which evrsion of windows they ahve installed, 2) which evrsion of IE they have installed, and wether they have any of the language packs requiring complex script rendering iunstalled, and 3) which other Microsoft products they have installed.  </s>
<s> Both the uniscribe development team and the Word development team are working on general support for combining diacritics and stacking diacritics.  </s>
<s> Its currently unknown when this will be released to the public, maybe through the next version of Office if its implemented by then.  </s>
<s> uniscribe isn't something that is always automatically upgraded.  </s>
<s> Graphite can, but needs soemone to design and build the graphite tables into appropriate fonts.  </s>
<s> SIL are working on a set of graphite unicoide fonts at the moment that should work with graphite and uniscribe.  </s>
<s> Not sure when they will ahve it finished.  </s>
<s> problem is that you still need a rendering engine that can correctly position the diactrics above a capital open-e and open-o.  </s>
<s> I haven't tried suing the gpos and gsub tabl;es in the fonts yet, but in theory support for that is limited in uniscribe (wrt to the Latin script).  </s>
<s> The fonts can be built, but until teh support exists in the rendering engine, the font will not do to much.  </s>
<s> yep ... i realise that.  </s>
<s> It would mean i'd have one set of fonts for key african languages and another for the Yolngu-matha languages for instance.  </s>
<s> very true a few people are working on comiling lists at the moment.  </s>
<s> Once the basic work has been done then it needs to move to the appropraite forums.  </s>
<s> Kewy people on the a12n-collaboration and Unicode Afrique mailing lists are present on the unicode mailing list.  </s>
<s> yep, I'm aware of this document.  </s>
<s> umm .. that leaves the issue of how to identify nost human languages then.  </s>
<s> For intsnce if I had a XHTML 1.1 page designed for Southern Sudan, in Dinka, Nuer and Arabic.  </s>
<s> I could provide provide an iso-639-2 language tag for Dinka, an iso-639-1 langauge tag for Arabic.  </s>
<s> But Nuer doesn't have an iso-639-1, iso-639-2 or IANA language code.  </s>
<s> OK i guess i could go through the hassle of trying to register a code, and wait and wait.  </s>
<s> What happens if I have a database driven web site with content in hundreds of African languages, most not having iso-639-1/2 or IANA codes.  </s>
<s> Not sure the appropriate bodies would appreciate all those registrations being dumped on them all at the same time.  </s>
<s> LOL :) I'll keep that in mind for a future project.  </s>
<s> Not sure IANA will appreciate it though :)  </s>
<s> LOL, I tend to only use unicode these days, although if the language cann't be rendered using unicode, i'll fall back to an 8-bit character encoding, but most 8-bit character encodings i've seen and used within the last few years do not have characters encodings registered with IANA.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the people who hacked together the fonts don't even know there is an IANA character encoding registry.  </s>
<s> We know that there is a registry and there are very good reasons for using it, but I come across a lot of people who are not aware of it.  </s>
<s> Catch-22 The amount of education that needs to be done, is extansive.  </s>
<s> Not just on issues relating to designing and implementing web sites and web services, but many of the background issues, relevant standards and why using them is important.  </s>
<s> The appropraite registries like IANA (for alngauge codes and character encodings) or the iso-639 registration authority.  </s>
<s> The most effective ways of using unicode.  </s>
<s> But some of the issues are even more fundamnetal, ie which unicode codepoints refers to which chacacters in the language.  </s>
<s> A good example of the possible confusions possible is current practice in Yoruba.  </s>
<s> Yoruba sues a diacritic below the "e", "o" and "s".  </s>
<s> In some textx this will be a dot below the letter, in others a vertical bar below the letter.  </s>
<s> Both forms are in wide use.  </s>
<s> Some Yoruba text will use U+0323 (COMBINING DOT BELOW) or appropriate precomposed forms, while other texts would use U+0329 (COMBINING VERTICAL BAR BELOW) which the Unicode charts iundicate is used for Yoruba.  </s>
<s> This lead to two possibilities: 1) the "dot below" and the "vertical bar below" represent two different orthographic traditions.  </s>
<s> Which isn't that uncommon in West African languages.  </s>
<s> Many langauges in West Africa have different orthographies in different regions (ie use different characters to represent the same sound).  </s>
<s> 2) that they are glyph variations, ie the same character, just different shapes in different fonts.  </s>
<s> approach 1) means that different codepoints or sequences of codepoints will be used to represent the same "character" in the language".  </s>
<s> 2) menas that only one unicode character wiull be used, but teh shape of the diacritic will change depending on teh shape of the font.  </s>
<s> Ie U+0329 might look like a "vertical bar below" or it mightlook like U+0323.  </s>
<s> Either way, the countries involve may have to standardise the orthography for this language.  </s>
<s> Everything is relatively nice and simple when dealing with european languages and east asian languages.  </s>
<s> But African languages have been neglected so long that its a real mess with respect to standards and web internationalization. Andrew  </s>
