<s> 4. no consensus on good change, so left it alone.  </s>
<s> 5. There is a strong consensus that we need to talk about script/applet.  </s>
<s> I think this would cover my concern about non-w3c standard (although not exactly the same).  </s>
<s> Since keeping the list to 10 items is important for marketing, I think either combining with graph/chart or recombining audio/video in one (and leaving graph/chart alone) are two valid options.  </s>
<s> First option: new 5. _No important information is lost_ Provide alternate content for scripting, applets or plug-in turned off, or when graphs and charts are not rendered.  </s>

<s> Avoid using tables to format text columns.  </s>
<s> Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes to mark-up complex tabular information.  </s>
<s> In general, I agree with Al and Charles that less is more and that we shouldn't spend ink on too much rationales and marginal esoteric point like complex table markup (which might prove useless in the end if XML succeeds and source XML db records are available for complex data).  </s>

<s> Just couple of small comments.  </s>
<s> Audio &amp; Video Provide captions or transcripts for audio and audio descriptions of video content.  </s>
<s> !! Should we use either "for audio" and "for video" or "of audio" and "of video" ?  </s>
<s> Tables Avoid using tables to format text columns, but in any case be sure the row (TR) reading order makes sense.  </s>
<s> !! Maybe it would be easier to use two sentences: "Tables Avoid using tables to format text columns.  </s>
<s> When using tables make sure the row (TR) reading order makes sense."  </s>
<s> What about table, row and column headings?  </s>
<s> Maybe there was discussion of this sorry for not having time to check.  </s>
