<s> What is the target date for final release of the specification XSLT 2.0  </s>

<s> You are unlikely to receive a specific answer from anyone on the Working Group.  </s>
<s> In times past the target, if I recall correctly, was the end of 2002.  </s>
<s> Clearly that wasn't achieved.  </s>
<s> Realistically, assuming a new Working Draft this month (surely one is due soon), I don't imagine a Recommendation appearing before Q3 2003.  </s>
<s> Andrew Watt  </s>
<s> Firstly, It's not part of the W3C process to publish planned dates.  </s>
<s> The reason for this is that the process depends on consensus, and you can't force everyone to agree by a certain date.  </s>
<s> Secondly, it depends what you mean by "final release".  </s>
<s> There are three important milestones ahead: - Last Call: this is a formal request to the community to submit comments on the specification.  </s>
<s> The working group commits to review and respond to these comments.  </s>
<s> If there is a high volume of changes in response to comments, the spec sometimes goes into a second last call phase.  </s>
<s> - Candidate Recommendation: this is a specification that the WG believes to be finished and to have achieved consensus, but which has not yet been proven to work.  </s>
<s> When a CR is published, "exit criteria" are agreed for making the spec into a Recommendation.  </s>
<s> These typically include some kind of proof that the specification is implementable and that implementations are interoperable.  </s>
<s> - Recommendation: this is the truly final version of the spec (except for errata!) We are hoping to reach Last Call stage in the next few months.  </s>
<s> The last two stages are becoming increasingly demanding as the volume of public comment increases and the requirements for interoperability testing grow: one can expect it to take between 9 and 18 months.  </s>
