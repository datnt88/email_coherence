Hi there, function MainFunction() { document.open(); 
document.writeln(); 
document.close(); 
If I Want to dynamically extend the given table "Kalender" with additional rows via the MainFunction script I cannot do this by simply using document.writeln(" 
TR TD ") etc. Can I access the table via the DOM and then have a kind of method to add a row and set the properties ?? The DOM is dealing with Window, Document etc. but I do not find for instance a Table object. 
Has anyone got any suggestions to help me solving this issue ? 
Patrick van den Bemt note the insertRow() method.

Boris, Thanks for the info, I am still a dummy to the DOM. 
I found the insertRow() method in the W3C DOM Level2 HTML spec. 
However now I have got a big questionmark. 
How do I implement this ? 
The W3C spec does not give examples. 
Let's assume I want to add a table with 3 rows and 2 columns using JavaScript on the following dummy HTML page This is a page to learn all about adding a table using the DOM How do I start ?

You start with a document.createElement("table"), then you create the rows, insert in the table, insert the table in the DOM. 
May I recommend reading a DOM tutorial such as as well... Boris Wallet [n]: Mythical object rumored to carry mysterious, disappearing substances referred to as "money" or "cash" (not to be confused with the C Shell). 
The association of this "money" to real life is currently being researched by R&amp;D (put Reality in the Background; Dammit). 
Full results are expected RSN, however, preliminary results indicate that this substance "money" is often required to obtain such necessities as computers, pizza, hard drives, caffeine, a network connection, and resolving the conflict between ordering the pizza and maintaining your network connection.
