I pointed my Amaya at http://www.openoffice.org/ - a page I know well. 
The areas on both the left and the right are improperly sized so that they overlay the central text area. 
Ugly in the extreme. 
The pages are generated using WebMacro - I will try to investigate the source but it looks fine in NS 4.75, and just awful in Amaya.

There's no way of properly sizing them as the HTML calls for them to be 180% + the width of an image, of the total width of the table! 
Actually percentages are invalid in this context, so the widths are undefined. 
Also, you have two, mutually contradictory, content-type meta elements. 
There are a large number of parsing errors (more than Amaya shows, even in Views|Show Parsing Errors). 
--------------------------- DISCLAIMER --------------------------------- Any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender, except where the sender specifically states them to be the views of BTS. 
This page defines wrong widths for some cells and it's why there is an overlay. 
For example it's difficult to display in a table 3 cells that match 108 + 100% + 80% I know that some browsers has complex algorithms which transform invalid sized attributes. 
We cannot do that in an incremental environment (Amaya is mainly an editor an develops incremental algorithms to redisplay partial changes). 
More, I guess it's not good idea to encourage authors to maintain these kind of errors.
