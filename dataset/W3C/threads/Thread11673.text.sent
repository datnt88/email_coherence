Thank you, Satoshi Hada IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory Hello: Now we have start translating XSLT 1.0 into Chinese(GB). 
XSLT_CN group, I started a while. 
But as a individual, It's very slow for me. 
Could we work on this spec togather? 
Thanks Yu anyone is also working on it, let me know. 
Hi Pei Jianfeng, I checked http://widget.home.chinaren.net/. 
What I saw is only Title and few lines translated. 
Even header not be set properly. 
I hope you can get everything done before annoucing. 
This is not a plce for your "annoucware". 
Actually I am translating this document into Chinese now. 
See you next time. 
Yu Hai an. Hi: I am very sorry for the mistakes there. 
This happened because yesterday, when I tried to update it to a latest version, the chinaren.net's 
homepage hosting system just didn't response my upload request and disarranged my homepage there. 
I will try to fit it today. 
Thank you very much for the concern about my translation.
