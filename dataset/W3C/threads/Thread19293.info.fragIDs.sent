<s> Two questions: 1.  </s>
<s> When I start a new document, it does something like HOME_PAGE\New.html.  </s>
<s> First, why does it have a \ instead of / since most web protocols use \?  </s>
<s> Second, is there a way to change the New.html to something like UserName.html?  </s>
<s> 2. When I open a new document, it opens another window, the same with Help  </s>
<s> selections, is there a way to have this all come in the same window.  </s>
<s> I tried changing IN_NEW_WINDOW in New ()to false but it didn't seem to have any effect.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, David  </s>
<s> Where is this \ generated?  </s>
<s> It seems like it would be easy to change, no?  </s>

<s> HOME_PAGE\New.html.  </s>
<s> There was a bug in the Windows 2.4 version.  </s>
<s> Amaya generated always a \ even if the URI was a Web address.  </s>
<s> Help  </s>
<s> If you call InitDocView (CurrentDocument, ....) instead of InitDocView (0, in the function InitializeNewDoc, it should display the new document in the same window.  </s>

<s> New.html comes from the global variable DocumentName.  </s>
<s> This variable is intialized in Amaya\amaya\init.c and you can change its intial value by whatever you want.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that I understood well your question but you may have a new window if you asked for or if the current document is modified.  </s>
<s> Otherwise and exept for Help, new docs are displyed in the same window.  </s>
