<s> Yes I can.  </s>
<s> I can because I believe that human beings have rights.  </s>
<s> I can because I believe that accessibility is a human right.  </s>
<s> I can because I do NOT believe that the profit motive is the only legitimate motive for taking action.  </s>
<s> In fact, I believe it is almost always the least  </s>

<s> Is there anyone on this list who is not promoting web standards?  </s>
<s> Utter nonsense.  </s>
<s> In fact, this is so obviously false that I'm shocked that you could even think it.  </s>
<s> How can you in one paragraph note that web designers are locking out 9% of their users intentionally and then in the VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH claim that designers build sites to reach the largest audience possible?  </s>
<s> What most designers do is try to reach the largest group FOR THE LEAST EFFORT.  </s>
<s> If it will take them 50% more effort to reach 5% more users, then they consider that a waste of effort.  </s>
<s> That's because they must put profit above human rights, or risk losing their jobs.  </s>
<s> And the sad truth is that most people just don't give a hoot about accessibility.  </s>
<s> They may pay it lip service (and many won't even do that), but they're not going to make any *personal sacrifices* for it.  </s>
<s> Ah, but you *are* saying that it is the right way, because we indicate the "right way" not by what we say, but by what we do.  </s>
<s> Actions speak much louder than words.  </s>
<s> So when we accept the status quo and make excuses for why things are the way they are, we are saying with our actions that this is the right way.  </s>
<s> Why would one defend or accept the wrong way?  </s>
<s> Throughout history, more evil has been wrought under the banner of "reality" than in any other way.  </s>
