I use a Macintosh and it is bad enough not being able to see many websites because they are coded for the Microsoft users of this world. 
You can't fault web designers for building sites that work in the browser that is used by about 91% of internet users 
(http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp). 
Now I know those 
stats are probably a little skewed, but it can't be by that much. 
And 
please don't get started on the whole "Microsoft is a monopoly thing." 
If you want to be able to view all of these supposed web sites that don't work, then you should be helping to promote web standards. 
Designers build 
sites to reach the largest audience possible. 
This is a simple fact of 
life. 
I'm not saying this is necessarily the right way, but it is certainly the reality of things. 
The Window-Eyes Professional software for Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP Home Edition, and XP Professional retails for $795.00, 
I suppose you expect they'd give it away for free, or sell it for $30? 
Sometimes the expectations that people have are just silly.

I think not, and I don't think that I should be forced into doing so. 
While I think that Macromedia is doing the right thing in addressing accessibility of its multimedia software and how it is viewed, I guess that many would agree that this type of product would be better if it incorporated all users, regardless of hardware or software. 
One last thing: has anyone on the list tested this software?

$795, plus the cost of Windows, plus the cost of hardware capable of running windows! 
Not to mention the serious hassle of mopping up each new "virus"!! How the **** is that supposed to be "accessible" to any but a tiny minority of the richest blind people? 
It's good that you're providing such products, but only so long as noone starts using it as an excuse for neglecting users of lower- cost systems!

THERE IS A WEB STANDARD, HTML, ASCII TEXT why the bloody *ell do they have to keep reinventing the wheel. the latest and greatest can read a HTML ascii text site and the oldest DOS 1.1 can read it, so it is "plain" is that a sin??? 
no designers build the sites to show off their latest "whiz bang" whistle and bell... 
The Window-Eyes Professional software for Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP Home Edition, and XP Professional retails for $795.00, 
why should a person with a disability even need to buy another piece of software just so the web designer can be a little lazy and not put in the "alt" text. 
I'm sorry but it is NOT the people with disabilities (or who just don't want this stuff) who are broke. 
it is the people who seem to think PWD need to be "fixed" so they can hobble through the minefield of complex websites?? 
No I don't expect people to work for free, I expect that it shouldn't even be needed...it is a product in search of a problem, and website designers are given another excuse for not designing correctly.

Yes I can. 
I can because I believe that human beings have rights. 
I can because I believe that accessibility is a human right. 
I can because I do NOT believe that the profit motive is the only legitimate motive for taking action. 
In fact, I believe it is almost always the least 
legitimate motive. 
And I can because I believe that web designers, like everyone else on this planet, should be held accountable for their actions. 
Is there anyone on this list who is not promoting web standards? 
Utter nonsense. 
In fact, this is so obviously false that I'm shocked that you could even think it. 
How can you in one paragraph note that web designers are locking out 9% of their users intentionally and then in the VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH claim that designers build sites to reach the largest audience possible? 
What most designers do is try to reach the largest group FOR THE LEAST EFFORT. 
If it will take them 50% more effort to reach 5% more users, then they consider that a waste of effort. 
That's because they must put profit above human rights, or risk losing their jobs. 
And the sad truth is that most people just don't give a hoot about accessibility. 
They may pay it lip service (and many won't even do that), but they're not going to make any *personal sacrifices* for it. 
Ah, but you *are* saying that it is the right way, because we indicate the "right way" not by what we say, but by what we do. 
Actions speak much louder than words. 
So when we accept the status quo and make excuses for why things are the way they are, we are saying with our actions that this is the right way. 
Why would one defend or accept the wrong way? 
Throughout history, more evil has been wrought under the banner of "reality" than in any other way. 
It's a crock. 
Reality is what we make it. 
We cannot escape responsibility for our creations by pretending that they just "happened" and that we are making the best of it. 
We created this world and we can uncreate it, too.

I'd expect these capabilities to be built in to every piece of software, since they are required for humans to use the software. 
That would make products like Window-Eyes superfluous.

Then WAI has no purpose, and should disband. 
The number of users who have accessibility problems by virtue of disability is always going to be a small minority. 
I wouldn't give any more credence to that than .. the paper it's not written on. 
Have you ever worked in, or studied, statistics? 
Agreed (this is a microsoft-free zone). 
I am trying very hard to do that!

(I'm not disabled, but I am a user of lower-cost systems than Windows).
