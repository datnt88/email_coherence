Hi, I need some clarification on the namespaces used for constructors and datatypes. 
In the F&amp;O spec, section 1.5 it says: The URIs of the namespaces are: * http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes for constructors * http://www.w3.org/2002/11/xquery-operators for operators * http://www.w3.org/2002/11/xquery-functions for functions. 
Which implies that constructors are in the In XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes section 3.1 (Namespace Considerations) The ?built-in? 
datatypes defined by this specification are designed to be used with the XML Schema definition language as well as other XML specifications. 
To facilitate usage within the XML Schema definition language, the ?built-in? 
datatypes in this specification have the namespace name: To facilitate usage in specifications other than the XML Schema definition language, such as those that do not want to know anything about aspects of the XML Schema definition language other than the datatypes, each ?built-in? 
datatype is also defined in the namespace whose URI is: Does this mean that either namespace can be used, even in the case of construction? 
Thanks for any clarification, Caroline Rioux, Software Engineer +44-1865-203192 DecisionSoft Limited http://www.decisionsoft.com 
XML Development and Services Hi Caroline, Good question! 
The short answer is that you can use ""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes" only if you import that schema. 
Even though the same set of datatypes are available under either namespace, the datatypes in the two namespaces are not exactly identical. 
If you go to the above URI, you can download the schema for datatypes, and you will see that it looks like the following excerpt: schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" targetNamespace="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes" version="$Id: XMLSchema-datatypes.xsd,v 1.5 2001/03/16 20:53:32 ht Exp $" For each datatype in the "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" namespace, it defines a new datatype in the "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes" namespace, deriving it from the original by trivial restriction. 
You can import this schema like any other schema. 
It's often easier to simply use the predefined xs: prefix, which always points to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema". Jonathan Thanks for the quick reply, What I am unsure about though, is whether or not users of our XPath2 implementation can invoke constructors within either namespace? 
for example, if I bind xf to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" and xs to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes", then which of these (or all?) are legal? 
'cast as xs:string(xs:decimal("15.5"))' 'cast as xf:string(xs:decimal("15.5"))' 'cast as xf:string(xf:decimal("15.5"))' On a different note, I thought that xs was bound to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" in the spec simply for convenience. 
You seem to imply that it is a predefined prefix which is always bound to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema". 
Yet the F&amp;O specs do use the xs: prefix for constructors, which is defined to be in the "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes" namespace.
