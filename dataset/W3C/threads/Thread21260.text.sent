My code for interfacing to Annotea via Mozilla is now available at A list of annotations is displayed in the sidebar, with the capability to display the bodies of the annotations, and an attempt to find the section of the document being annotated. 
There are instructions on installation, screenshots, and the source code can be browsed. 
Bugs can also be filed. 
Please feel free to comment. 
Thanks to Art Barstow for sorting out the problem with the content type. 
Matthew Wilson This is great! 
Thank you all for doing it/helping to do it. 
Marja Excellent Matthew! 
I intend to demo the bookmarklet stuff at the WWW10 Semantic Web Developer's Day: Please let me know your thoughts about me also demo'ing Annozilla. 
I'm looking forward to trying it. 
Art Go for it! 
Matthew I just wanted to pass on some info that may be helpful if you want to try Matthew's Annozilla: o It didn't work for me with Mozilla 0.6 but worked fine after I installed 0.8.1 [Linux, x86, Red Hat]: o If you need to create an account, see: [Note that a '+' sign in the user name causes a problem so don't use that char until the problem is fixed.] 
o In Edit- Preferences- Annozilla, set the Annotation server to: o To see some annotations, go to: Art Kudos, Matthew; this is wonderful work. 
I'll buy you a beverage of your choice at our first face-to-face opportunity :-) I was puzzled at first why clicking on one of the annotations in the sidebar seemed to do nothing after prompting me for my username/password again. 
Then I discovered I should scroll the Annozilla sidebar down to see the body text box. 
Can I configure things so the body text box pops up in a new (desktop) window? 
Thanks for this hint, Art. 
It certainly tripped me up since I had registered as swick+annotate in re-register for a new account. 
(Note to Marja: don't double-count me as a user for WWW10 :-) Do you know where this problem might lie? 
I also notice that annotations on my 'home' page are not displayed immediately after restarting Mozilla until I go to a different page and then back to my home page. 
I tried Shift+Ctrl+R to reload my home page but this doesn't seem to have changed anything; still have to visit a different page then backup. 
The Annotea servlet received "swick annotate" [the '+' was replaced with a space] so my guess is that Annozilla needs to URL encode the username before it sends it to the servlet. 
Art Matthew, As far I understood, you cannot create yet annotations with Annozilla. 
Could you add a paragraph in your doc saying so in your project home page and add a link from it to the Annotea project (like consult this page if you want to see other clients, including clients that can create annotations). 
Or, as an alternative, say that currently, you can only create annotations with Amaya and Art's bookmarklet. 
This way users will know how those annotations were made :) Thanks, -jose This is now mentioned on the installation page and has been reported as a bug: Users can report bugs themselves (although they will have to register first). 
Matthew That shouldn't be too hard, I have raised it as and will get round to it soon. 
Some URL escaping thing. 
I already escape the user name, but I'm wondering if I need to escape the whole URL again afterwards. 
Hmm... OK: http://mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=262 
Matthew I do encode the username, etc., before passing them, but neither Mozilla nor IE5 think that a '+' needs to be encoded. 
I can change the code to manually encode a '+' (I've tested this and it works), but it seems a little odd.
