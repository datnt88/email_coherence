Hi everybody This is the first time i have use tidy, and i found it very very usefull, it is an amazing HTML utility. 
This is my original code: This code was generated by Tidy TABLE border="0" width="100%" height="70" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E4E4E4" TD height="21" bgcolor="#C0C0C0" /TD and it is very nice, however i want the code to look like this instead of: TABLE border="0" width="100%" height="70" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E4E4E4" and instead of TD height="21" bgcolor="#C0C0C0" wat do i need to configure? 
thanks in advance V i r g i l T. R e b o t o n w e b m a s t e r 1SPEEDCOM.COM

Hi, Try these settings: --indent-attributes = no --wrap = 0 Best regards Mattias This message has been scanned by F-Secure Anti-Virus for Microsoft Exchange.

I don't know if you have seen it, but TidyUI is a great way of visually playing with the tidy settings and instantly seeing the results. 
Great for troubleshooting layout issues like this one. 
It even has a link to the tidy docs for each setting.
