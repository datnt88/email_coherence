<s> XSLT spec says: "A top-level variable-binding element declares a global variable that is visible everywhere (except where it is shadowed by another binding)."  </s>
<s> So variable declared in stylesheet module which imports (or includes) another stylesheet module is visible also in imported module.  </s>
<s> I think this could be big problem for creation of precompiled libraries used in many stylesheet - any stylesheet module can have references to undeclared (at time of compilation) variables.  </s>
<s> This also applies to functions, keys, sort keys etc.  </s>
<s> Also accidental overriding of 'private' variables and function of library could be undesirable (making impossible static typing in library when @as attribute is different in new declaration).  </s>
<s> Maybe solutions from XQuery (modules) could be somehow adopted?  </s>
<s> Or at least some kind of 'standalone' stylesheet module flag and rule disallowing overriding variables/funtions with one with different static type (@as attribute).  </s>
<s> This will solve many problems.  </s>

<s> The way that multiple modules work in XSLT was established in XSLT 1.0 and isn't something we can easily change.  </s>
<s> It is true that the chosen approach makes it quite difficult to do separate compilation of stylesheet modules.  </s>
<s> I'm sure it's not impossible, though, if someone feels that it's sufficiently important to their users.  </s>

<s> This will not be a problem if library developers use the good design practice of having names in their own and unique library-specific namespace.  </s>
