<s> I've noticed that the test suite tests the following scenario: When entity references are expanded, the test suite tests that Entity nodes and their replacement value are available in the DOM tree (attrsetvaluenomodificationallowederrEE, characterdataappenddatanomodificationallowederrEE, textsplittextnomodificationallowederrEE, etc.) Given that the DOM Level 1 fails to define when Entity nodes are present in the DOM tree, I believe that the test suite should NOT be testing the above case.  </s>
<s> If you look at the description for the Entity interface (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html#ID-527DCFF2) you will find that the specification only defines the what happens to the entity replacement value ("if the replacement value is available, the corresponding Entity node's child list represents the structure of that replacement text"), but says nothing about when Entity nodes are present in the tree.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the DOM Level 3 does define the feature "entities" that controls both Entity and EntityReference nodes: false [optional] Remove all EntityReference and Entity nodes from the document, putting the entity expansions directly in their place Thus, I would expect DOM Level 3 implementations to fail DOM Level 1 test suite for the described above case.  </s>
<s> Any comments?  </s>

<s> The description of the entities attribute of DocumentType interface (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html#ID-4 12266927) has no conditionals.  </s>
<s> The implementation option to expand or preserve entity references on the other hand is very explicitly stated.  </s>
<s> Which by my reading says that if there is an entity declaration in the DTD, there should be a corresponding Entity node regardless of whether the implementation chose to preserve or expand entity references.  </s>
<s> The "entities" normalization features is bothersome.  </s>
<s> It does not correspond to a configurable behavior of any common DOM implementation and there is not a feature that corresponds to the widely deployed behavior of expanding entity references, but preserving entity nodes.  </s>
<s> I think the intent was: If you loaded the Doctype, its Entity nodes would be created.  </s>
<s> Period.  </s>
<s> I can't see any reason NOT to load that info if you're able to do so...?  </s>
<s> In the main document content tree, you would have EntityReference nodes if the reference was not (or could not be?) fully expanded.  </s>
<s> The decision of whether or not to do that expansion was originally left up to the processor (or equivalent DOM builder).  </s>
<s> Presumably if you use DOM Load/Save you'd control it from there.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Two reasons: 1) I fail to imagine a use case where one cares about the entities when she/he doesn't care about the entity references.  </s>
<s> 2) Having the entities can be very expensive.  </s>
<s> Think about a document where ever chapter is hold in its own entity.  </s>
<s> You end up with twice as much memory used.  </s>
<s> That's ok if you care about the entities and their refs but a real shame if you don't.  </s>
<s> I don't think there is much value in trying to interpret/second guess what is expected to be found in a DOM tree after parsing based on the DOM Level 1 spec.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 1 doesn't include any parsing capability and therefore anything related to parsing is undefined.  </s>
