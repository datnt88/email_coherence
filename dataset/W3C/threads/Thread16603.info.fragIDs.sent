<s> WAI guidelines yield highest probability of true Web access INFOWORLD, October 23, 2000 CLINT EASTWOOD had his day in court last month.  </s>
<s> A jury ruled he would not pay damages to a disabled woman claiming his Carmel Mission Ranch violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, but it did cite him for two minor violations.  </s>
<s> After Dirty Harry makes these repairs, he may look into the accessibility of his Web site properties.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility for the disabled is gaining momentum and awareness.  </s>
<s> Just last year, America Online was sued by advocates for the blind because the ISP didn't provide access to meet their special needs.  </s>
<s> To help Web developers, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) produced a set of guidelines for Web content accessibility (www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT).  </s>
<s> Looking through the guidelines, I found a working set of best practices that take into account the variety of environments from which our visitors experience our sites.  </s>
<s> The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines support two themes for accessible design.  </s>
<s> First, "ensuring graceful transformation," which means pages remain accessible given different operating environments and conditions.  </s>
<s> The key to graceful transformation is a separation of content, structure, and presentation.  </s>
<s> XML is a great technology to achieve this goal.  </s>
<s> Remember, content is what you say to visitors, structure is how it's organized, and presentation is what it looks like.  </s>
<s> The second theme focuses on "making content understandable and navigable."  </s>
<s> So much of that is simple, straightforward language.  </s>
<s> But it also means providing tools for easy maneuvering around the site.  </s>
<s> Although themes are great, the beef of the WAI is in the list of 14 guidelines and associated checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Even though some of the checkpoints may seem extreme and would render 99.9999 percent of the Web in violation, they are useful to understanding what will yield the highest rate of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Although I've listed the guidelines below (and have commented on them), I still recommend you visit the WAI site yourself.  </s>
<s> 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual contents.  </s>
<s> Go to town with the Alt tag.  </s>
<s> 2. Don't rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> Focus on contrast.  </s>
<s> 3. Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.  </s>
<s> All those absolute units will go to relative units.  </s>
<s> 4. Clarify natural-language usage.  </s>
<s> GRAU (Guaranteed to Reduce Acronym Use).  </s>
<s> 5. Create tables that transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> Tables for layout equals NO-NO.  </s>
<s> 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> Lose your style sheets and see what happens! 7. Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes.  </s>
<s> Auto-refreshing your pages?  </s>
<s> Think again.  </s>
<s> 8. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.  </s>
<s> Scripts and applets should work for ALL devices.  </s>
<s> 9. Design for device-independence.  </s>
<s> Allow the client to do it all.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Use interim solutions.  </s>
<s> No more pop-ups!  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> Use W3C technologies and guidelines.  </s>
<s> What about Flash?  </s>
<s> 12. Provide context and orientation information.  </s>
<s> Every frame should have a title.  </s>
<s> 13.  </s>
<s> Provide clear navigation mechanisms.  </s>
<s> Too obvious -- make sure all navigation tools are consistent, search works, and don't forget the site map.  </s>
<s> 14.  </s>
<s> Ensure that documents are clear and simple.  </s>
<s> Headings are a must.  </s>
<s> Keep it simple and leave the jargon behind.  </s>

<s> Hi All,  </s>
<s> When I speak about web accessibility, this is one of the most controversial issues.  </s>
<s> I know this has been talked about here before but it is my contention that most tables used for layout do transform gracefully in the web browsing solutions used by people with disabilities and are not a major impediment to accessibility.  </s>
<s> I agree with Kely here.  </s>
<s> Most of the (graphically intensive) sites that I have worked on have of course used tables for layout.  </s>
<s> I find that a basic 4 cell table translates very well into a screen reader since it is in the following order:  </s>
<s> 1. [top-left cell] Site Name / URL / Company Name 2. [top-right cell] High-Level Links 3. [bottom-left cell] Lower-Level Links 4. [bottom-right cell] Page Content This works very well in the screen reader I use for testing, IBM Home Page Reader.  </s>
<s> A nice feature of Home Page Reader is that once you have heard a list of links several times (such as high-level links), it will just skip that block after you have seen it on a few pages.  </s>
<s> Another item on the list, "Go to town with the alt tag" is misleading.  </s>
<s> True, you should always use the alt attribute, but it is important to use alt="" for non-meaningful graphics as opposed to describing them.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, no one listening to a web page wants to hear: "Spacer Image.  </s>
<s> Circle Bullet.  </s>
<s> Spacer Image.  </s>
<s> Left side of arc..." When you tell a developer "Always use alt," that isn't enough, you should always stress using a "Meaningful text equivalent."  </s>
<s> Behalf Of Kelly Ford true Web access Hi All,  </s>
<s> When I speak about web accessibility, this is one of the most controversial issues.  </s>
<s> I know this has been talked about here before but it is my contention that most tables used for layout do transform gracefully in the web browsing solutions used by people with disabilities and are not a major impediment to accessibility.  </s>
<s> I believe this is a misreading of the guidelines by the author of the article.  </s>
<s> I think Kelly is correct.  </s>
<s> I do not believe that layout tables are currently a major accessibility barrier.  </s>
<s> I believe the current guidelines (WCAG 1.0) reflect this; however, there is an education problem because for so long, many people were running around equating tables with inaccessible design and promoting CSS-P as an alternative (despite the fact that it still is not viable to this day).  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> In my view this is the wrong order.  </s>
<s> The best order is generally 1, 4, 2, 3. That means that you can get to the meat of the article quickly.  </s>
<s> More important for the authors, it means that search engines include something sensible from the text as the summary in the search results.  </s>
<s> Not all search engines use meta elements.  </s>
<s> In normal textual academic papers, it is usual to include the references at the end, not start with them (commercial documents rarely have references).  </s>
<s> I thought that tables were reccommended as the best pragmatic approach to layout, or is this a newer draft than I've read.  </s>
<s> Table tables can degrade gracefully if you include redundant p 's, spaces, etc.  </s>
<s> If you accept my reading order, you can make tables used for layout degrade gracefully by tricks with col and rowspan.  </s>
