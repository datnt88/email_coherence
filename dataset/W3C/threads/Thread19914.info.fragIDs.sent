<s> I've had the same problem on occasion in 32bit (Win98), but haven't reported it because 1) I haven't been able to trace down the behavior precisely enough for a bug report to be meaningful, and 2) thought it might be a FAQ.  </s>

<s> Same thing here.  </s>
<s> The third Icon at the top is transparent, while the others are not.  </s>
<s> I took a look at the page using IE v4a (NU Version, I don't know what the difference is), and saw something else - the GIF Oxon.Gif does not appear in Amaya, but does appear in IE.  </s>
<s> I wish I could install Netscape to see if there is anything else... Ok, I just upped my res to 32bpp and the GIFs appeared fine (Transparent, and everything...).  </s>
<s> When I switched back, the GIFs remained transparent (Correctly), but I refreshed, not only did the GIFs return to normal, but also, the last image disappeared and Oxon.GIF appeared with a green background.  </s>
<s> I then downed the colors to 8bpp, and the GIFs again behaved properly with the correct transparency.  </s>
<s> My guess right now about the odd behavior after the screen resolution changes is that the "residue" of the processing hung around, but when processing the images natively in the 16bpp environment, it does not appear to like the transparency.  </s>
