Hello, I have just been talking with Philippe Le Hegaret, who is the W3C DOM Activity Lead about checkpoint 5.1, which in the Candidate Rec [1] reads: 5.1 Provide programmatic read and write access to content by conforming to W3C Document Object Model (DOM) specifications and exporting interfaces defined by those specifications. 
[Priority 1] There have already been much Candidate Rec discussion about this checkpoint (refer to issues 190 [2] and 194 [3]). 
Here are some additional comments from my conversation with Philippe: 1) DOM only addresses HTML and XML. 
Therefore, checkpoint 5.1 would not cover programmatic access to content in any other format, such as SGML. 
2) Philippe feels that user agents should be required to conform to DOM Level 2 core and Level two HTML. 
DOM Level 2 core is the same as DOM Level 1 core, but adds XML namespaces. 
DOM Level 2 HTML is the same as DOM Level 1 HTML. 
Conformance to the other DOM Level 2 modules is optional according to the DOM 2 spec. 
His point is this: requiring DOM Level 2 core/HTML conformance is not much more than DOM Level 1 conformance and not including namespace support would be a mistake. 
Also, if you want to implement events, you can do so on top of DOM Level 2. You can't on top of DOM Level 1 alone. 
3) The DOM does not specify a notion of "read-only DOM", although the DOM Working Group has considered doing so (in a future version). 
It is not clear that the UA Working Group could make a requirement that user agents implement the "read-only" parts of DOM 1 and/or 2 since the specs do not define "read-only". 
We conclude therefore that: a) We need a checkpoint that ensures access to content that may not be HTML/XML. 
b) We need to reconsider the "read-only" checkpoint proposal. 
Thoughts?

Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 It is perfectly possible for us to specify that for a User Agent, having access to any defined list of DOM methods, properties or interfaces is an accessibility requirement. 
It is extra work for us to go through the specification and say what parts of the DOM need to be available as an accessibility requirement, ireespective of whether a User Agent implements DOM or just does a few things in the specification. 
I agree that namespace support is going to be important as soon as there is namespace-qualified content available. 
Since it is a W3C recommendation, we might expect that to be common already (it is used to add MathML and RDF metadata to XHTML, for example, which works in existing browsers) or in the very near future. 
It could also be implied by the requirement to implement the latest available and appropriate specifications.

Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia To address this point in particular, I propose that we add a checkpoint whose language echos that of Candidate Rec [1], checkpoint 5.2: Provide programmatic read and write access to content using standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs such as the W3C DOM, standard APIs for the operating system, and conventions for programming languages) [Priority 1] Then, the checkpoint requiring DOM for access to content would be an important special case of this checkpoint (and both would be priority 1). 
A note would indicate that for XML and HTML, satisfaction of the DOM requirement would meet the more general checkpoint.
