<s> I would particularly like comments on the i18n requirements arrived at by the group in Orem, if possible by COB Wednesday, July 23.  </s>
<s> The consensus of the group at Orem was that we should stay away from issues around variants, which are not specific to internationalization and would add enormously to the work of WEBDAV.  </s>
<s> Jim will make sure that this position is acceptable to the area directors.  </s>
<s> The question was raised whether we need to be concerned about collation.  </s>
<s> We think that we do not -- we do not sort any query result sets, and we do not define greater-than or less-than operators for pattern matching.  </s>
<s> We think that we need only to insure that any information intended for user comprehension should be expressed in a way that makes it possible to display the information in any desired writing system and language.  </s>
<s> The proposed internationalization requirement is the following: "All information intended for user comprehension must be expressed in one of the ISO-10646 character sets and must have a language tag." --Judy Name:Judith A. Slein E-Mail:slein@wrc.xerox.com  </s>

<s> I have stated that I believe that any authoring extension for a standard which allows content language to be negotiated (hence hiding the URLs of the individual language versions from the consumer) should provide the same level of abstraction to the authors.  </s>
<s> It seems as though the rest of the group does not agree.  </s>

<s> I can't speak for the rest of the group, but I can explain why that abstraction is neither possible nor desirable.  </s>
<s> Server-driven negotiation requires a namespace mapping between the server's back-end "files" (whatever storage name is used to store the representations) and the negotiated URL.  </s>
<s> In order to write directly to a negotiated URL, the server would have to be able to identify which of these back-end "files" needs to be replaced, or where to store a new representation, AND how the negotiation algorithm for that URL needs to change to accommodate the new representation.  </s>
<s> Likewise, the semantics of PUT must change to take this into account.  </s>
<s> Since server-driven negotiation is not as simple as comparing a few header fields like Content-Language, the algorithm behind the namespace mapping can be very complex and server-dependent.  </s>
<s> Standardizing a description of the mapping that uses the internal server storage names instead of individual URLs is impossible.  </s>
<s> In any case, it makes both the protocol and the implementation far more complicated than it needs to be, since the author is far more likely than the client application developer to already know the nuances of the particular server on which the WebDAV operation is being performed.  </s>
<s> If a client attempts to write to a negotiated URL, then it should get an error or 300 redirection response that includes pointers (links) to the individual representation URLs.  </s>
<s> This is exactly the same response that you would get by trying to write to a dynamically-generated resource instead of to the source of the resource.  </s>
<s> The client can then ask the user to select the specific URL for the operation or enter a new one.  </s>
<s> Such a dialog is easier to standardize, easier to implement, and more likely to avoid mistaken results.  </s>
<s> BTW, all implementations of server-driven negotiation that I am aware of already use individual URLs to identify the representations of a negotiated URL.  </s>
<s> Since Apache has two different internal mechanisms for defining a mapping algorithm, not counting the API mechanisms, we'd prefer to have the author select exactly what they want to do rather than have to guess.  </s>
<s> Unlike GET operations, bad things might happen if we guess wrong.  </s>
