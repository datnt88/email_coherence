Hi, This is not a bad joke or a provocation, but I'm looking for a free tool that could decently print a long (~ 130 pages) HTML document with a stylesheet. 
It should, among other things, honor the page-breaks for printer media as defined in CSS 2. All I could get until now, trying Amaya (that was very good at composing the document, espacially the "make book" feature), Netscape (including the Mozilla betas and DocZilla), Internet Explorer was at some point unsusable : pictures and/or text lines splitted over two pages (IE), mangled formatting (Amaya, Netscape Navigator), no page breaks (all but IE), no page numbering (none of the Mozilla breed), etc. 
So far, having a report printed is a somewhat frustrating experience. 
A clue any one ?

However, the one other freeware solution I know of is html2ps.

That's really too bad. 
It was a really nice program (I still have it, and often use it).
