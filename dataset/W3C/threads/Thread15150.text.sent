My two cents worth, I like seperating them. 
Yes there is overlap, but the seperation brings clarity. 
There are two disitict tasks that need to be done, and they may overlap somtimes, but even when the stucturing of a document does not make it more readabnle for cognitive disabilties - it still needs to be done, for distinc and important resons. 
Yup - skiming and navagatablity and one more - alternitve renderings optermised to the user. 
A distinct structure allows a stuctured rendering , or information fhiding and jumping around the page - all the types of things we are making at SWAP. 
Simply - without it we can not build assistive tecnologies that provide these fetchers. 
4.1 is somthing of a tricky one, will often be down plaid and misunderstood. 
It will also be as long as the proverbal piece of string in terms of implemtion. 
By adding to it (instaid of "use plain English", "use well structured plain English and expose that structure in the markup"?) are doing exactly what both 3.1 and 4.1 preach against - Muddling Peaple so that we can have less points, less sentences, and save ourselves a full stop or two? 
I think 3.1 will stand a better chance if it goes it alone. 
All the best, Lisa Seeman UnBounded Access Widen the World Web Behalf Of Wendy A Chisholm [snip] Agreed. 
These are related in the same way that all checkpoints are related, but they are different in terms of implementation. 
They also serve different (albeit overlapping) audiences. 
So it makes no sense to me that they be combined - this is a bit like combining textual equivalents and direct accessibility of interactive content. 
cheers Chaals Agreed. 
I feel we have to better explain where the checkpoints are addressed to structure (markup) and where to content. 
The point is that markup and content have different metods and rules and it's important to specify which are the terms of implementation. 
I also feel that too much overlapping between them could brings to confusion, not clarity. 
So I think that 1.3 needs to explain which is the correct way to use markup, 3.1 is important to know that informations need a solid structure and 4.1 could explain that good structure needs also a good "communication" to reach the state of art (or trying to do it at least). 
To better explain: 1.3 means: "use H1 before H2 and not vice versa" 3.1 means: "before make code or design, make a flowchart and test the information flow, make sense to content" 4.1 means: "explain all with simple words, good communication and correct language (not slang, not words too technical)" What about?
