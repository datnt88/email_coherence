<s> 1.Much has been mentioned about the cumulative terror of the round trip time (RTT) penalty paid for many small HTTP requests, each of which requires its own TCP connection (and resultant RTTs) required to fetch and render an HTML document and its component objects.  </s>
<s> Compounding the problem, some anti-social network clients initiate multiple concurrent TCP connections in an attempt to create the illusion of a speed up by distracting from boredom by rendering all objects as they arrive simultaneously.  </s>
<s> Should the user choose to abort a document load conducted in this way, it aborts all in-progress TCP connections as well.  </s>
<s> The network is then then saddled with what others have observed as the substantial overhead of all the silent screams of those aborted connections.  </s>
<s> 2. Packing all or part of an HTML document and its components into a multipart MIME message in response to an HTTP GET would increase the number of bytes sent along a single TCP socket connection.  </s>
<s> This will avoid some of the network congestion observed with the multiple and/or simultaneous low content-length TCP sessions when clients build the document.  </s>
<s> While valuable work is underway to provide binary-encoded and multiplexed transport-level solutions to the multiple connect problem [ Spero, Raggett, HTTP-ng ], We need to look concurrently at exploiting the transport encoding scheme upon which HTTP theoretically rests to address this problem--MIME.  </s>
<s> I do not believe that this approach conflicts with any of the work on HTTP-ng, and could envision a case where they could be used together transfer multiple HTML documents and their components quite rapidly.  </s>
<s> Most of all, we need to provide many options allowing for maximum tuning and customization on all sides.  </s>
<s> 3.Operating under the assumption that at this time in the life cycle of the web, most HTML documents contain components that reside on the same server as the document itself, why not trade the multiple network connections from the client to the same server for some up-front packaging by the server.  </s>
<s> Instead of a server having to clone itself into as many instances as sub-objects it serves, it could perform a rudimentary (cached) parsing of the document to determine the appropriate sub-objects that it served as well, package them up into MIME body parts sent along with the HTML document.  </s>
<s> Accesses by the server on which the components reside usually requires merely a simple secondary storage access measured in terms of milliseconds which in the vast majority of cases is significantly less than that of a TCP RTT which can run into perceptable fractions of whole seconds.  </s>
<s> As an option, the server could resolve any object references resident on other servers (caching the results in shared memory), and include them in the multipart data stream.  </s>
<s> What follows is a draft protocol for encoding an HTML document and its components in multupart MIME.  </s>
<s> 4.The client would need to include multipart/mixed* in its Accept: headers if it chose to accept this encoding.  </s>
<s> A terminal-based browser such as lynx or LineMode would not send this in its Accept: headers and could thus opt out.  </s>
<s> If a browser had the flushed the HTML document from its cache but had not flushed some of its inline images you would not want to include this header unless you wanted the larger, complete data stream.  </s>
<s> The server builds a multipart/mixed* message consisting of the HTML document and whatever components were resolved.  </s>
<s> The server could be configured either to resolve and cache or leave to the client any components that resided elsewhere.  </s>
<s> * multipart/mixed might be better as application/http or multipart/http.  </s>
<s> I defer to the MIME dieties for a ruling.  </s>
<s> 6. Interoperating efficiently with client cache management brings up some interesting issues.  </s>
<s> The ability to check the HTML document's requirements against the client-side cache before issuing a precisely tailored HTTP MGET request (which would be returned as multipart/mixed*).  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> The HTML document is included as a body part of Content-Type: text/html.  </s>
<s> The outermost MIME headers (or the header associated with multipart/mixed*) contain a Message-ID: field in the form: Message-ID: URI Each component object is identified by a Content-ID: field that is in the form: Content-ID: URI In this manner, each body part can be unpacked by the client, inserted into its cache data structure, any missing body parts could be acquired, and the multipart images would be pulled out of the cache struture to render.  </s>
<s> The master HTML document can be recognized as main body part by the URI common to both the Message-ID: field and that of the Content-ID: field in one of the Content-Type: text/html body parts.  </s>
<s> 7.An instance of the proposed MIME encoding scheme for HTTP follows.  </s>
<s> This is currently in the process of a feasibility study in METHADONE (Mime Encoding THreAded Daemon Optimized for Network Efficiency), a caching, lightweight threaded, MIME multipart encoding HTTP server for solaris 2.x (exploiting the rich base functionality of NCSA's httpd) currently under beta development at the UCSF Library and Center for Knowedge Management.  </s>

<s> One thing to consider (not that i think this is a bad idea) is that often the objects being sent along are images leading to two non-optimisations.  </s>
<s> 1) Mime encoding is going to roughly double the number of bytes sent 2) By explicitly sending them every time, the server wont allow the client to cache the images, so for example the stupid blue ball for a "bullet" will get send a zillion times.  </s>

<s> 2) By explicitly sending them every time, the server wont allow the client to cache the images, so for example the stupid blue ball for a "bullet" will get send a zillion times.  </s>
<s> This is why in our experiments we added a GETLIST method, so that the client can explicitly request those images that it needs.  </s>
<s> We also had a GETALL method ("give me the HTML and all the inlined images") but we had to do some tricky heuristics to decide when it was better to use this than to do a GET followed by a GETLIST.  </s>
<s> GETLIST, of course, can also be used to retrieve a set of HTML files, not just a set of images.  </s>
<s> And we actually implemented it as a series of GETS stuffed into the same pipe, rather than as a new method.  </s>
