<s> I am trying to include a svg fragment in a xhtml document.  </s>
<s> The following was created by Amaya and views well with Amaya but I cannot get any other browser to display the svg portion.  </s>

<s> It seems to conform to the requirements below.  </s>
<s> accept the xmlns for the svg.  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" / rect stroke="black" fill="none" y="32px" x="21px" width="402px" height="96px"/  </s>
<s> But many specialized viewers are not able to mix xhtml, svg and mathml.  </s>
<s> With the adoption of OpenGL, the Amaya team hopes to make important progresses in the SVG support.  </s>

<s> There is a difference between conformance and validity.  </s>
<s> The conformance says that the document is well formed, the validator checks if the document respect a DTD or a schema.  </s>
<s> The definition of a DTD XHTML+SVG+MathML is in progress.  </s>
<s> It will allow you to validate this kind of document in the future.  </s>
