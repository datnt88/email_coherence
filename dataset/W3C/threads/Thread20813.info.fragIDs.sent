Are there any viewers that can display such a file besides amaya? 
Neither 
Mozilla 0.99 or IE 5.5 can! 
Not sure if this is the right place for Amaya bugs? 
The Amaya help menu 
doesn't tell me where to go. 
www-amaya@w3.org is the right place. 
Using Amaya from CVS today.. 
I have an html page with inline SVG at: The bug is that just under the diagram there is a line with "] " on it. 
I'm not sure if this is my bug, or Amaya's, but I'm hoping that someone here can tell me? 
In fact your document is not correct and the Amaya html parser is too tolerant here. 
You cannot include a complete xml document within a html document. 
The main document should be an xhtml document and you should use the namespaces technology to include SVG within. 
The xml declaration can appear only at the beginning of the document. 
See http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/conform.html which explains how to include SVG fragments. 
The characters come from the end of the preamble to the inline SVG in the 
middle of the html: 
?xml version="1.0" 
encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? 
!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd" [ !ATTLIST svg xmlns:xlink CDATA #FIXED "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ] Shouldn't this entire !DOCTYPE.... block be ignored for layout?

Mozilla has SVG support.

I was testing the Mozilla with MathML and SVG executable (windows version) ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest-trunk/mozilla-win32-svg-mat 
hml.zip Trying to read Amaya generated files. 
Mozilla complained about some indefined tags. 
Their implementation of MathML is no complete. 
And like Amaya, the SVG isn't complete too. 
I think Amaya is (yet) the more powerful viewer for mathML, buf for SVG there are many specialized viewers: 
Changing of subject: I'd port my MS word generated math pages to Amaya, buf it does not have (yet) cookie support, and that is mandatory for my site. 
I don't see any plans near in time for developing cookie support, dosen't it?

Thank you for all responding. 
I am trying to include a svg fragment in a xhtml document. 
The following was created by Amaya and views well with Amaya but I cannot get any other browser to display the svg portion. 
Do you know of a browser that can support the svg fragments? 
It seems to conform to the requirements below. 
accept the xmlns for the svg. 
!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" / rect stroke="black" fill="none" y="32px" x="21px" width="402px" height="96px"/ 
But many specialized viewers are not able to mix xhtml, svg and mathml. 
With the adoption of OpenGL, the Amaya team hopes to make important progresses in the SVG support. 
I don't see why cookies are mandatory. 
The core Amaya team doesn't plan to work on cookies support today and I don't know if the support provided by the library libwww is enough stable and complete. 
Irene. 
There is a difference between conformance and validity. 
The conformance says that the document is well formed, the validator checks if the document respect a DTD or a schema. 
The definition of a DTD XHTML+SVG+MathML is in progress. 
It will allow you to validate this kind of document in the future.
