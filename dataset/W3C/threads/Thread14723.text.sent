Hi, Web page developers seem to prefer tables over CSS for much layout. 
Has anyone done any testing of how long it takes to create a layout using tables and then do a similar testing of producing the same layout using CSS? 
Thanks, Scott Just from a developer who does this daily - I can layout a page with tables in about a 1/4 of the time to do it with css (or even less depending on complexity). 
The reason being is that every browser handles css so differently. 
Tables are pretty straight forward and the results are almost the same across browsers. 
But I will go back and forth between browsers with css - fixing it in one, then destroying it in another and vice versa.

Thanks, Scott Hi, The other question I forgot to ask was is how much easier is it to learn and master tables as compared to CSS for layout? 
Thanks, Scott Both of these things are really tricky to learn, and most people use a tool that does it automatically for them. 
For anyone capable of writing such a tool, CSS-based layout is generally a lot simpler to build interfaces for.

Thanks, Scott Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I'm also a developer, and I do this sort of thing almost daily as well. 
I find the opposite is true. 
CSS takes me less time than tables. 
I think it is a mixture of personal style, and the nature of the website you are doing. 
At UNITE, our perl seems to lend itself very easily to css layouts. 
It must be said, there is at least one table based layout I couldn't get to work in Netscape 4.7 using CSS. 
Andrew Andrew McFarland UNITE Solutions Hi, I'm a little unclear. 
When you use CSS for web pages, are you using a tool written in perl or are you hand coding the CSS? 
If you are using perl, I was wondering what your experience is with hand coding CSS? 
Thanks, Scott PS What does your perl tool do?
