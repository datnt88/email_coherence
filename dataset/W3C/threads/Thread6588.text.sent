Hello, I use a PC running Windows 2000 and MSWord 2000 installed. 
Your use of the generic san-serif font leaves your Web pages almost unreadable! 
Any way to get around this? 
Thanks, Gary. 
If you can identify the font you are seeing, try uninstalling and then reinstalling that font. 
But this is only a wild guess based on another visitor's experience. 
IE has generic font-family bugs dating back years, that need to be reported to Microsoft, for example at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - http://www.w3.org 
Is it better to use serif or non serif fonts in a document for people with low vision? 
Roger Roger, I am not an expert on this particular question, and I think it's a complex one in an international context (i.e., where fonts for various scripts may differ substantially in their appearance). 
While the following is not a definitive answer, the lighthouse [1] suggests the following, at least for familiar western fonts: "Avoid complicated, decorative or cursive fonts and, when they must be used, reserve them for emphasis only. 
Standard serif or sans-serif fonts, with familiar, easily recognizable characters are best. 
Also, there is some evidence that sans-serif fonts are more legible when character size is small relative to the reader's visual acuity." 
While sensitivity by the author is important, it is probably more important that the user be able to choose whatever font best suits that user's needs. 
Hence the requirement in the UAAG 1.0 to provide control of font family [2]: "Allow global configuration of the font family of all visually rendered text, with an option to override font families specified by the author or by user agent defaults." 
I hope this helps, - Ian [1] http://www.lighthouse.org/print_leg.htm
