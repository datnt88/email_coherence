Dear folks, thanks to everyone who attended the meeting, and to those who struggled with the phone system long enough to get it working, at particularly awful times of night. 
I felt it was a particularly productive and useful meeting, and I have put up the new draft of Wombat first thing today New Zealand time. 
It has not been announced on list yet but is available from the group page. 
Many thanks in particular to Gregory for minuting two days straight - because he is doing it for two more meetings it will be a few days until we get the second day, so here is my recollection (not to be trusted over what gregory will send): We are planning our next face to face meeting in September, the week of 10-14, in northwest america (Vancouver or Seattle). 
We are planning to attend the next W3C plenary around Nice, France, in February 2002. 
We will work a little more on Wombat, then set it on the path towards a public draft and do some work on the techniques document. 
People are required to re-join the group now our new charter has become active. 
Note that an official announcement of this will be coming, and note that people are required to do an ATAG evaluation of some authoring tool each 12 months as part of the requirement for participation. 
The evaluation of Domino that Graham did was helpful to the folks at Lotus (they told us), and useful for us, raising some issues. 
Thanks Graham grin/ we worked on the Wombat in the morning, and that work is reflected in the new draft. 
We also briefly discussed tools that would be useful - a form-based evaluation report tool, and one that produces EARL so we can easily do a , implementation report when we get to candidate recommmendation, the logistics of moving from WCAG1 to WCAG2 (seems like a bunch of work, but not a whole lot of hard thinking with luck), and when / how EARL might fit into authoring tools as a requirement (useful now, but not likely to be something we could require for a long time if at all). 
And finally, Gregory J Rosmaita, of jersey city, New Jersey, USA, member of the AU working group and representative of VICUG-NY to WAI, volunteered to be the editor of the evalaution techniques (which we will seperate again from the implemenation techniques), and Phill, Graham, Bill, Charles, Wendy, Katie, Daniel, Giorgio, Jan, Chris, and Jutta all witnessed it. 
Thanks Gregory for taking that on too.

And so did I!! grin/ No way out of it, Gregory!

Hi Charles. 
I asked to join the group just now and thought of doing the evaluation of dreamweaver+508 accessibility suite. 
It might be an interesting exercise of a developer doing an auto evaluation. 
I'll do it as soon as the revised wombat document is ready. 
Cheers, Giorgio 
Hi Giorgio, the Wombat draft of 22 June was published on 22 June, or are you interested in waiting until the techniques documet gets republished? 
Anyway, I think it is likely to be very useful if a developer does an evaluation, and asks the group about things that were unclear. 
They are often able to do them faster because they know more about the software (but not always) ;-) And welcome to the group!
