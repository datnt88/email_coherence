<s> I visit the W3C site again and again and again, and write to this address again and again and again.  </s>
<s> Last year, I remember it was July 9.  </s>
<s> I found html 4.0 draft in W3C site, then I translated it.  </s>
<s> To last July 31, I finished it, and send the compressed Chinese version to W3C.  </s>
<s> Later, I put the Chinese version to my own site, that is  </s>
<s> But until now, there is only my name on the no link to the particular location.  </s>
<s> Why? A lot of Chinese persons find my e-mail on that page and write to me ask that when could I finish it and where can find it, the only sentence I can say is: this is not my fault, it is W3C's fault.  </s>

<s> Hello Yule, Thank you for putting time and effort into a translation of the HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> I apologize for W3C's slowness in getting your site on the translations page.  </s>
<s> I will see to it that this gets done.  </s>
<s> Thanks again for your patience, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> Hello Yule, [I have reduced the cc to w3c-translators@w3.org.]  </s>
<s> I also apologize for the problems at W3C. Can you tell me when you wrote, and to whom (if possible in private)?  </s>
<s> This is the first time I have seen a message from you on w3c-translators@w3.org, which is the official mailing list for translations.  </s>
<s> The working draft you mention has been replaced by the actual HTML 4.0 recommendation, and is not available anymore from the seen the HTML 4.0 Recommendation?  </s>
<s> Are you planning to update your translation?  </s>
<s> I have had a look at this site.  </s>
<s> As far as I understand, the actual translation is at http://makesure.ml.org/html40/cover.html.  </s>
<s> Is this correct?  </s>
<s> I'm sure we can fix this problem very soon.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
