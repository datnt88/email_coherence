I visit the W3C site again and again and again, and write to this address again and again and again. 
Last year, I remember it was July 9. 
I found html 4.0 draft in W3C site, then I translated it. 
To last July 31, I finished it, and send the compressed Chinese version to W3C. 
Later, I put the Chinese version to my own site, that is 
But until now, there is only my name on the no link to the particular location. 
Why? A lot of Chinese persons find my e-mail on that page and write to me ask that when could I finish it and where can find it, the only sentence I can say is: this is not my fault, it is W3C's fault.

Hello Yule, Thank you for putting time and effort into a translation of the HTML 4.0. 
I apologize for W3C's slowness in getting your site on the translations page. 
I will see to it that this gets done. 
Thanks again for your patience, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) 
Hello Yule, [I have reduced the cc to w3c-translators@w3.org.] 
I also apologize for the problems at W3C. Can you tell me when you wrote, and to whom (if possible in private)? 
This is the first time I have seen a message from you on w3c-translators@w3.org, which is the official mailing list for translations. 
The working draft you mention has been replaced by the actual HTML 4.0 recommendation, and is not available anymore from the seen the HTML 4.0 Recommendation? 
Are you planning to update your translation? 
I have had a look at this site. 
As far as I understand, the actual translation is at http://makesure.ml.org/html40/cover.html. 
Is this correct? 
I'm sure we can fix this problem very soon. 
Regards, Martin.
