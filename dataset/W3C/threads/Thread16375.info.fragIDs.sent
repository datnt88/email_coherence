<s> Reply: I don't have handy references to the URLs about San Francisco, but perhaps some information about Utah State University's recent adoption of Web accessibility guidelines will be of use to you, at least indirectly.  </s>
<s> Like New York's new standards, U.S.U.'s guidelines are also based on the w3c standards.  </s>
<s> Our policy includes all of the priority 1 and 2 standards, as well as some of the priority 3 standards.  </s>
<s> When I drafted these standards, I decided to reword and reorganize them according to topic, rather than according to priority number, in the hopes that this would simplify things (at least somewhat) for U.S.U. web developers.  </s>
<s> The policy has not been "officially" announced, but many of the U.S.U. webmasters know about it and have received some preliminary training on how to comply with the standards.  </s>
<s> Enforcement will not begin for several months (probably not until late next year) but the drive to make the pages accessible will go into full effect at the beginning of the year.  </s>
<s> In fact, the U.S.U. webmaster is already preparing a complete makeover of the main university site offline.  </s>
<s> Our own website (www.webaim.org) is in a state of transition as we begin to take these guidelines seriously.  </s>
<s> You can access the draft of USU's "Guidelines For Web Accessibility and Universality" at By the way, the main purposes of our new, grant-funded project (Web Accessibility in Mind, or WebAIM) is to specifically address the issue of Web accessibility within the post-secondary education arena, so I would be more than happy to be of service to you and to the universities you mentioned.  </s>

<s> On the wai interest group listserv, there is a thread (which you may already know about) regarding the lawsuit, but the thread is a bit dated.  </s>
<s> The link to the wai archive which started the thread is The main page for those archives is up, you'll have to scroll down to nearly the bottom.  </s>
<s> I, personally, have not heard anything more recent about this issue.  </s>
