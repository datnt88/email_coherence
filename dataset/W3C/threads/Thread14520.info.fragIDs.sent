<s> You may not present relevant textual content as an image, unless the text has a primarily graphical function, and the effect cannot be achieved with markup, (as in the case of some for logos and limited accent elements) provided that you provide a textual equivalent to the content contained in the image.  </s>

<s> I should note a terminology problem here -- there is no such term as "violating WCAG 1.0 Priority 2". WCAG 1.0 compliance is measured in terms of Single-A, Double-A, and Triple-A, not in terms of priority.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure about the phrasing of your question here, though; it's a bit semi-backwards in thinking.  </s>
<s> I believe my answer is "no"; although I could argue for "yes" if I felt like it.  </s>
<s> (But I don't.) In order to answer "yes", you will have to show that there is an existing technology which provides the same effects as the existing graphics.  </s>
<s> Presumably the answer here would be to use CSS.  </s>
<s> You could possibly do this (although note that the font is not just "sans-serif", it is a specific font), and you will have to explain what the benefits and drawbacks of doing so are.  </s>
<s> You will have to explain why this is an accessibility barrier to specific individuals, and explain why the available assistive technology -- ranging from turning off images to employing a screen magnifier or a magnifying screen reader -- requires the _elimination_ of this type of design.  </s>
<s> You will also have to explain why the only way to fix this is to remove the graphics entirely, and furthermore explain when you should _not_ remove graphics, as this sets a precedent saying "graphics are bad, don't use them, ever."  </s>
<s> I think that's a lot to ask, but if you think you can do it, then you can probably tell the state of Pennsylvania whatever you like.  </s>
<s> You might get further with them arguing the benefits from using styled text, rather than simply a legalistic "WCAG says so" argument, but I understand that many bureaucrats in state government need to be told directly "you must do this because it is THE LAW" instead of "you should do this because it will make your web page better."  </s>
