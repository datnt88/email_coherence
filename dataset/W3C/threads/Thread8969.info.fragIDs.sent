<s> Donald, the "Additional XML Security URIs" [1] draft will be expiring in July.  </s>
<s> What should we do next with it?  </s>
<s> I don't think we've had many requests for additions recently.  </s>
<s> Do you want to publish it as an Informational RFC?  </s>
<s> Another option is to publish it on the W3C site.  </s>
<s> One could do it as a NOTE, or even more informally, just as a document in the date space (e.g., /2002/01/foo) as just a staff/administrative thingie.  </s>
<s> Not good for normative references, but it can be useful to applications... [1] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-02.txt  </s>
<s> Hi Jospeh, I've been thinking I should polish it a little and submit it as an Informational RFC.  </s>
<s> A W3C Note or internal version of it could certainly be produced as well, same as the base XMLDSIG document is issued in both organizations.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if there are any pending specific additions although there have been a few which have been discussed in generalities.  </s>
<s> I'd appreciate it if anyone who had some specific request for an addition could send me some specific wording.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Donald Donald E. Eastlake 3rd dee3@torque.pothole.com  </s>

<s> Hi Donald,  </s>
<s> I would request removal of the XPointer transform: The new XPath filter transform (in intersect mode, whatever form we choose) is exactly equivalent.  </s>
<s> Merlin r/dee3@torque.pothole.com/2002.06.04/23:33:32  </s>
<s> I don't know if it's right to remove it... (Someone out there could've conceivably used it and we'd pull the rug out from under them.)  </s>
<s> We should amend it to say there's a new method.  </s>
