Hi, HTML 4.01 says, IDs must be case-insensitive unique, but user agents must treat it case-sensitive. 
So, is getElementById() case-sensitive in the HTML DOM? 
How handle current implementations the case, when an ID isn't unique, what do they return for getElementById()?

Yes. 
As you pointed out, "user agents must treat it case-sensitive". 
The DOM doesn't currently check for uniqueness.. DOM Level 3 may address this. 
Meanwhile, I'd say that any response to a poorly-formed document is equally acceptable. 
Personally I'd lean toward "If it isn't unique, it isn't really an ID, so none of them match" -- which would be easier to diagnose and repair than picking one at random. 
Or move toward the XHTML world and declare the document invalid -- though there is so much broken HTML currently in use that this isn't always an option. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Hi All, I completely agree that even though duplicate IDs should stop processing (not just match none), I think we owe some advice for what to do when part of the broken HTML universe is encountered. 
Hey, you just have to start from the beginning and get it well-formed and obeying the uniqe ID rule and others before you can work with it using XML/DOM tech. 
What if the broken HTML uses name instead of ID? 
There are probably ten other considerations like this. 
What to do with broken stuff.? Well, you must start by fixing it!:) How about running it thru TIDY or equivalent before processing it further. 
Just finding out that it is broken is certainly some level of accomplishment that should be recognized as a good thing. 
I hope we don't get to a point where we start bending some basic structures and rules to accomodate broken stuff that should just be fixed. 
Thank You and Best Regards, Joedw web3dc
