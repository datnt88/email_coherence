Hi, Error. 
Now that the right hand navbar is gone, the homepage no longer links to checklink. 
I would suggest we replace the "Download" link with a link to checklink. 
regards. 
Fixed. 
That instance was actually an older one (3.9.1) than the current production one, I updated it to CVS HEAD. 
The setup is not too clean at the moment, and it is possible that it'll break again when validator is updated from CVS in case "cvs up" removes checklink.pl. 
After the next :8001 restart, checklink will be using /home/ville/LinkChecker/etc/checklink.conf. 
Why not. 
Download info is available through Docs, depends how prominent we want that to be if we want to replace or add the checklink link. 
By the way, we need to do something about the download/install/devel documentation. 
Currently there are: All those contain more or less the same information, but at least devel.html has outdated prerequisites. 
I'll look into it. 
Suggestion: combine all of this stuff into install.html, and remove devel.html and source/ (and add redirects from them to install.html).
