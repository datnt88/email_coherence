<s> In the Document interface why is the not a helper-function for the creation of Notation Nodes?  </s>

<s> Document not having a factory for Notation (or Entity, or DocumentType): I read this as part of the "defer details of DTD handling until Level 2" decision.  </s>
<s> DocumentType in Level 1 is mostly a placeholder...  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Since Notations are effectively read-only due to the fact that we don't expose editing operations on the DTD information via the DOM API, there's no reason for a Factory method.  </s>
<s> BTW, the WG just agreed *not* to do much on defining an API for validation or editing the "DTD" information until the schema situation is clarified; we're concerned that hard work would be nullified by changes in this rapidly evolving area.  </s>
<s> I don't know what this means in terms of actual time, but we won't tackle that until Range, Style, Events, and Query interfaces are defined.  </s>
