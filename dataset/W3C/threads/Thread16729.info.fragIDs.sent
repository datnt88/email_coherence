<s> Neither is supposed to have this function; the noframes section is supposed to have the function!  </s>
<s> The use of frame names is a work around for blank no frames and "you need to 'upgrade' your browser" no frames first used by Lynx, but then adopted by Amaya, at least.  </s>
<s> It is only marginally successful because the pages that need it tend to name frames left, top or centre, rather than indicating their function.  </s>
<s> The use of title is just the obvious generalisation of title to frame elements.  </s>
<s> I would reckon the chances of finding title on a page that doesn't already have a useful noframes element are negligible.  </s>
<s> Laurie, I find the discussion of frame titles really depressing.  </s>
<s> It is depressing because there is not a clear recommendation from WCAG, trying not to be too prescriptive, I guess.  </s>

<s> I know of no other AT that uses/used the title attribute.  </s>
<s> (3) Jaws uses the name attribute of the frame element for its list of frames, and announces both the name attribute and the title element as it reads the frame.  </s>

<s> (5) HPR v3.0 uses the title element of each frame page in its list of frames; it uses neither the name nor the title attribute.  </s>

<s> My reasoning: It is useeful to the people who are now living with systems that speak the name (lynx for example), and there needs to be a name anyway.  </s>
<s> It is useful to have a better title - that's the thing that is intended to be read to a human (name is for targetting content into one frame or another).  </s>
<s> The AT should be speaking the title.  </s>
<s> The Web developer needs to add a name, and should add a title thatmay be the same (navigation) or may be more useful if they are planning on being helpful.  </s>
<s> The authoring tool should make this more or less painless anyway.  </s>
