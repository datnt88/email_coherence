Chris O'Kennon Commonwealth of Virginia Webmaster -----Original Message----- wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa Yes, we went through it before. 
I have collected the URIs at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/resref.html 
We will be adding to this as we collect more references on a variety of topics (not just color perception). 
Does anyone want to help me gather the various links, resources, papers, and etc. that we have referred to over the last few months? 
e.g., Lisa I know you contributed several links for references for learning disability. 
Could you help me dig those up? 
Thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa
