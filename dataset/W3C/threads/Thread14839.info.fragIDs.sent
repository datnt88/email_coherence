<s> The following message attempts to summarize the open issues which have arisen with respect to the structure and composition of the working group's deliverables, in particular the role and status of techniques and associated requirements.  </s>
<s> Thanks are due to Gregg for his prompt and helpful review of this summary.  </s>
<s> Outline: The structure of this working group's deliverables is as follows:  </s>
<s> (a). Guidelines/checkpoints/success criteria, as published in the principal guidelines document.  </s>
<s> These are formulated in "technology-neutral", yet precise terms.  </s>
<s> (b). Concise, concrete explanations of how to meet each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Some of these are, but others may not be, technology-specific (see the discussion below).  </s>
<s> (c).  </s>
<s> Miscellaneous commentary, code examples explanatory materials, and alternate ways to accomplish the strategies which again may be specific to particular technologies.  </s>
<s> HOW THESE RELATE TO 1.0 In WCAG 1.0, layer (a) appears as a W3C Recommendation (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0), though it should be noted that the guidelines and checkpoints are not expressed in fully general terms and involve subtle technological assumptions and dependencies which have been largely eliminated in the WCAG 2.0 working drafts.  </s>
<s> Layers (b) and (c) are combined, at least conceptually, in techniques documents, though the means of satisfying checkpoints have not been expressed as concise and clearly identifiable assertions.  </s>
<s> In WCAG 1.0, there are no success criteria associated with each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Open issues: 1.  </s>
<s> What should appear in layer (b), and how should the requirements at this level be organised?  </s>
<s> Obviously, some of the "implementation strategies" are technology-specific (that is, they pertain to particular standards and formats, such as (X)HTML, SVG, etc.).  </s>
<s> However, there are checkpoints under guideline 3, and possibly guideline 2 as well, which would be implemented in largely the same manner irrespective of which technology is to be used.  </s>
<s> For example, in applying checkpoint 3.3, the technology (HTML  PDF  SVG etc.) is irrelevant to the way in which an author proceeds to satisfy the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> In other cases, there are only trivial differences (for instance, checkpoint 3.4 obviously involves the association of sounds/images with content, but the markup code or other mechanism with which to accomplish this is well known and there would be little benefit in writing separate techniques for each technology in relation to such a checkpoint).  </s>
<s> Rather, techniques related to checkpoint 3.4 would need to explain under what circumstances auditory/graphical supplements aid comprehension and how to design them effectively.  </s>
<s> Similar issues arise in respect of checkpoint 1.1: although the mechanisms by which text equivalents are provided varies according to the technology which is used, the underlying conception of what constitutes an adequate "text equivalent" remains constant.  </s>
<s> In WCAG 1.0, these issues were addressed by writing a "core techniques" document which discussed issues and strategies of broad application that were not technology-specific, and a set of technology-specific documents (HTML, CSS, etc.).  </s>
<s> A comparable solution is needed for WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> 2. How should the requirements of layer (b) be formulated?  </s>
<s> A central concern underlying discussions of WCAG 2.0 has been that the "implementation strategies" be expressed in clearer and more concise terms.  </s>
<s> For example, it has been argued that where there are alternative means of satisfying a checkpoint using a specific technology, it should be made plain to the reader exactly how many alternatives are provided, what they are, and whether each of them is sufficient (by itself or in specified combinations) to satisfy the success criteria stipulated in the guidelines, and hence the checkpoint itself.  </s>
<s> The working group needs to decide whether the strategies set forth in layer (b) should follow a prescribed format, and if so, what that format should be.  </s>
<s> 3. Should layer (b) be included in one or more normative documents (i.e., W3C Recommendations), or should it be informative only?  </s>
<s> Advantages of normativity: I. Developers who successfully implement relevant requirements from layer (b) will thereby have some assurance that they have satisfied the corresponding checkpoint or checkpoints.  </s>
<s> II.  </s>
<s> Layer (b), as part of a W3C Recommendation, would receive the same close scrutiny and careful review as the guidelines themselves.  </s>
<s> Disadvantages of normativity: I. Normative documents are slow to change as technology evolves, due to the requirements of the W3C process.  </s>
<s> II.  </s>
<s> If layer (b) were normative, this would complicate the over-all conformance scheme of the guidelines, because it would be necessary to deal with the possibility that an implementor could successfully satisfy the success criteria associated with a checkpoint, but in ways other than those prescribed in layer (b).  </s>
<s> III.  </s>
<s> The existence of success criteria in WCAG 2.0 provides greater clarity regarding what must be achieved in order to satisfy each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> This at least partially satisfies the need for precision and certainty which motivates the desire, on the part of some members of the group, that layer (b) be normative.  </s>
<s> Hence, it may no longer be considered necessary to make layer (b) normative.  </s>
<s> IV.  </s>
<s> If the requirements in layer (b) do not provide complete "implementation strategies" for satisfying each checkpoint, then it would still be necessary for implementors to assess their content by reference to the guidelines document itself, rather than solely in relation to various "specific" (layer b) requirements.  </s>
<s> Thus there may be little advantage to developers if layer (b) were normative.  </s>
<s> 4. What should layers (b) and (c) be called?  </s>
<s> The question which has received most consideration in this context is, what should we call layer (b)?  </s>
<s> Suggestions include: I. Techniques.  </s>
<s> II.  </s>
<s> Technology-specific checkpoints.  </s>
<s> III.  </s>
<s> Implementation strategies (or simply "strategies").  </s>
<s> IV. Checkpoint solutions.  </s>
<s> Observations: As noted above in connection with guidelines 2 and 3, many of the requirements in layer (b) are unlikely to be technology-specific; hence it would be misleading to refer to them all as "technology-specific checkpoints".  </s>
<s> Also, they may not be analogous to "checkpoints" as such, especially where several alternative strategies are given for achieving the same result.  </s>
<s> Thank you for summarizing your understanding of the issues.  </s>
<s> There is at least one issue I feel that I don't find here, so let me float it and see what people think.  </s>
<s> It is interesting that all the issues you list deal with what comes after part (a).  </s>
<s> Part (a) is summarized as  </s>
<s> The idea that technology neutral terms are used here could be an issue.  </s>
<s> At least, it contributes to making two things difficult.  </s>
<s> It makes it difficult for the content development community to apply what is said, and it makes it difficult to make precise statements.  </s>
<s> The second difficulty reaches P2 criticality at least in the area of ameliorating barriers affecting cognitive impairments.  </s>
<s> More generally, it increases the cost of producing work product.  </s>
<s> The first difficulty reduces the effectiveness of this piece of the work product.  </s>
<s> Cap it all by dubbing this part "the _principal_ document" and you start having a task description that is daunting enough to engender a significant level of worker frustration.  </s>
<s> And we may have been observing some worker frustration.  </s>
<s> Is the frustration built into the actual objective, or is it an artifact introduced by our work rules?  </s>
<s> I want to offer a little more discussion of why a "principal document" that declines to name names in terms of technology [and, in fact, in terms of disability] may not be the most effective strategy for this group.  </s>
<s> Our objective is to propose a win-win deal to the content development community.  </s>
<s> A win for people with disabilities, because content produced pursuant to the deal offered will work for them.  </s>
<s> A win for content producers for two reasons.  </s>
<s> For one thing, they have readily followed objective techniques to follow, and don't have to learn arcana about lots of different disability groups.  </s>
<s> For another thing, there is the "canary in the mineshaft," or "curbcut" effect.  </s>
<s> Fixing things that are failure modes for people with disabilities does have collateral usability benefits in the wider community.  </s>
<s> Here I want to appeal to William Ury's teaching about how to discover, frame, and sell a win-win deal in the course of a negotiation.  </s>
<s> [Book: Getting Past No] What I want to focus on is the 'discovery phase' leading to 'stipulations' in the language of judicial adversary processes in the U.S. What this boils down to is that one tries to maximize through mutual discovery a body of assertions that both or all sides will accept or stipulate as agreed a_priori.  </s>
<s> These things we don't have to argue about or for.  </s>
<s> To get things stipulated, it really helps to be able to frame them as matters of fact.  </s>
<s> If we can qualify some statement in others' eyes as a matter of objective fact, that will appeal to many people as cause to stipulate and not argue about those points.  </s>
<s> This is a long winded way to say, what we can convince ourselves are statements of objective fact, and can state in a way that appeals to others as observations of objective fact, are easy to get accepted.  </s>
<s> Whatever we can cover that way we should, before we go after the more debatable points requiring judgement calls or an appeal to abstract moral principles.  </s>
<s> It could be that this is the best way to characterize what we offer the web development community: that we have collected and connected the relevant facts.  </s>
<s> We have done their research for them, and they can make informed decisions now because we eliminated the research step.  </s>
<s> All they have to do is skim the research report we produce and formulate their plans in the light of what they learned.  </s>
<s> Now, as a matter of judgement, it seems to me that it is extremely difficult to frame credible statements of objective fact in this area without naming names as to both disability and technology.  </s>
<s> Explanations of the interaction of specific disabilities with specific technology usage are easy to state in a way that is easy to accept as fact.  </s>
<s> Try to purge the statements of any trace of specific disabilities or technology and one is left uttering "psychobabble."  </s>
<s> Our major mission is to come up with a consolidated recommendation that has broad and non-discriminatory benefit for all manner of people with disabilities, and proposes strategies that work around conflicts between the interests of different groups.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if we insist in our working medium on euphemizing what we have to say by failing to name specific disabilities and technologies, we may just have shot ourselves in the foot.  </s>
<s> If our primary means of selling our recommendations is by appealing to their basis in fact, and the facts are not recognizable as facts without naming [disability and technology] names, then trying to frame precise statements of the threshold of acceptable usage in disability- and technology-blind language may not be in the cards.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the primary things that users of our work product need to be able to [on user election, that is to say on a 'pull' protocol basis...] get from it are: - for a given work task that they are assigned, to ascertain what advice of ours pertains.  </s>
<s> - for a given piece of advice of ours; if they wish, to review the reasoning behind it.  </s>
<s> This may mean some of each of the following: + traceability to a failure mode, if violating the advice leads to failure for some condition + traceability to an optimization, if following the advice makes significant contributions to usability and effectiveness across some range of conditions + comparison of the impacts on differently-affected groups, where we had to engage in trades and balances reasoning to come up with a recommendation.  </s>
<s> The units of advice may be technology-specific or technology-abstracted or both, but including the technology-specific statement [or applicability, in an index] of units of advice in the main body of work, the nominal scope of our principal work product, will definitely help with the "find applicable advice" step.  </s>
<s> The backups at the ends of the "traceability" links are probably best stated in language which is specific as to disability condition and only as abstract with regard to technology as is clear.  </s>
<s> The principal quality factor for our output could possibly be the ease with which our readers move between the advice and rationale levels of exposition, so that we get a user-directed depth of browse as they move through this material.  </s>
<s> By putting a major document and work division between the consolidated, disability-and-technology-spanning advice and the disabilty-and-technology-specific facts, we may be making our task significantly more difficult, and more frustrating, than it really needs to be.  </s>
<s> Does this make any sense?  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Eminent good sense.  </s>
<s> The justifiable complaints about WCAG 1.0 were directed at *its* accessibility/usability and more of the same will suffer the same.  </s>
<s> That (normative semi-regulatory-sounding) already got done and has led to a spate of referring-to-it laws/regulations/policies which, not that they are engraved in marble don't need a lot of chipping or even cleaning.  </s>
<s> *They* got the idea.  </s>
<s> "Normative" is no longer in the hunt but "informative" is de rigeur - which is what CMcCN has been saying over on ATAG - "keep those techniques coming, folks".  </s>
<s> As Trummy Young sang "'Tain't Whatcha Do, It's the Way Howja Do It - That's What Gets Results."  </s>
<s> If you would hear this use the "result-oriented" link at Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> Yes, but it is rather vague and very hypothetical--sorry Al.  </s>
<s> The WCAG 2.0 draft gives a very good indication of what this working group has aimed to achieve by writing general guidelines and checkpoints that don't address specific technologies.  </s>
<s> If there are problems with this draft that result from the design decisions which the working group has made in this respect, then it would be important to ascertain, in concrete terms, what these are.  </s>
<s> Specifically, is it possible to read the current draft with Al's arguments in mind and identify significant problems that are likely to hinder comprehension or application of the  </s>
<s> guidelines, bearing in mind the technology-specific layer which is  </s>
<s> presently being written?  </s>
<s> In part of course, the "usability testing" proposal will provide data on which to make that assessment, but given the issues which Al raised in his message I find it very difficult to derive concrete, verifiable hypotheses regarding the current draft, the validity of which can be tested to determine whether there really is or is not a problem here.  </s>
<s> It's not exactly sky-pie but it's definitely still vapo(u)rtext.  </s>
<s> I can't speak for Al but as an interested observer there is essentially not much beyond motherhood in the principles.  </s>
<s> The "but what do I do?" so vociferously raised by those to whom we assign the doing is still in some sense glossed over.  </s>
<s> This is most strongly evidenced by those items with "the vagues", e.g. checkpoint 1.3 Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of content.  </s>
<s> Even (or perhaps particularly?) with the subsequent explanatory success criteria and "informative" definitions/benefits/examples there is a residual unease with just what one attempting to conform is supposed to do.  </s>
<s> I think this is underlined/emphasized by "The definition for data model is under discussion."  </s>
<s> The model of the document as a sort of "constitution" or "legislative array" awaiting "case law" elucidations seems stale when so many participants could furnish *real* examples of "how-to" stuff.  </s>
<s> I think trying to divorce some hierarchical "principles" from the output isn't working out too well - YAGL, by the time it's through the process, something new has arisen to send the team back to the debating platform.  </s>
<s> Those who write *for* rather than *about* Web inclusion use tools which, unless carefully designed, will undermine accessibility/usability/readability/function and IMHO between WCAG 1 and ATAG 1 that could now be approached fairly closely.  </s>
<s> The current document has the virtue of being internally politically correct by going through all the process that is required of a "recommendation" but in doing so makes a mockery of a favored mantra "it's a web, not a tree" because of the strict hierarchical attitude imposed with "levels of conformance", "priorities", and sterilized checkpoints carefully avoiding the contamination of any real-world examples whenever possible.  </s>
<s> Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> Not anymore.  </s>
<s> Several drafts exist already, and they are to be discussed at the face to face meeting next week.  </s>
<s> Not in the technology-specific documents however, which will furnish  </s>
<s> I don't think so; the examples and success criteria seem quite clear  </s>
<s> The problem with "data model" is not conceptual; we have a reasonably  </s>
<s> To the contrary, the purpose of the Candidate Recommendation period  </s>
<s> The examples are entirely real-world, they just stop short of naming  </s>
<s> any particular technologies (though they do describe the kind of technology, e.g., a style sheet, a script, a graphics language etc.).  </s>
<s> If one wants technology-specific examples, then one should read the technology-specific documentation; and of course it would be possible to create a view in which the technology-specific requirements appear below the relevant WCAG 2 checkpoints, with accompanying examples, so that the reader doesn't have to move back and forth between two documents in order to read the checkpoints in the context of her/his preferred technologies.  </s>
<s> At the outset of this process, the working group decided to generalise the guidelines and checkpoints, and to separate them logically from the technology-dependent requirements and examples.  </s>
<s> That is the premise on which the development of WCAG 2.0 has proceeded, and I hope these decisions do not need to be revisited now.  </s>
<s> From the requirements document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-requirements): WCAG 2.0 requirements should be expressed in generic terms so that they may apply to more than one markup language or content format.  </s>
<s> 2. WCAG 2.0 must clearly specify the minimal requirements necessary for conformance.  </s>
<s> Each requirement must be easily verifiable.  </s>
<s> The WG will provide resources to help readers evaluate conformance, such as technology-specific checklists, sample sites, sample renderings (aural as well as graphical), and processes for determining conformance (e.g., in conjunction with the ERT and EO WGs).  </s>
<s> The WCAG 2.0 draft is intended to satisfy the first of these requirements and, by providing success criteria, part of the second.  </s>
<s> The remainder of the second requirement is to be met by (as the Requirements Docuemnt indicates) technology-specific documents and checklists, working examples, etc., the development of which is underway but lags behind that of the guidelines themselves.  </s>
<s> This is why much of next week's meeting is devoted to techniques and technology-specific work.  </s>
<s> Could we at least postpone discussion of this issue until the technology-specific documents have started to stabilize, and we know what "views" of the documents we plan to provide to readers?  </s>
<s> After that we can check, with the aid of usability testing, to find out whether there are any problems that haven't been addressed.  </s>
<s> AG:: But it would appear they do need to be revisited.? The WAI as a whole made the mistake of chartering sequels rather than shifting grids to target pockets of residual dysfunction.? We all share in the responsibility for that.? But to ignore the clear signs of trouble with this quote deliverable unquote would be unwise.  </s>
<s> Now is better than later.? Based on what we have learned since then.? The group may decide whatever it decides.? But not to question those earlier decisions at this time would be irresponsible, in the light of the mounting evidence against them.  </s>
<s> The "signs and portents" that we have a problem are all over the place.? The troops are reduced to fighting amongst themselves because they can't seem to get to a point where they feel they have accomplished something.? A bystander has muttered "but, the Emperor has no Clothes."?  </s>
<s> How much more evidence do you need that this premise needs to be evaluated for validity before moving on further?  </s>
<s> Let me explain what I perceive as the significance of what Kelly Ford said.  </s>
<s> Kelly has shown us that The Emperor Has No Clothes.  </s>
<s> Labeling active elements adequately, so that the user can be oriented to what they do, in whatever delivery context the user happens to be operating in, is the number one most important problem to be reformed on the World Wide Web today.  </s>
<s> If Kelly Ford, who understands the domain of this document deeply already before reading it, can't find the advice for how to fix this number one problem in this document, it is time to set it aside?  </s>
<s> and think again about what we think we are doing, here.  </s>
<s> We have a draft of WCAG 2.0, but on reviewing this draft, one can clearly see we _don't_ have a _product_, here.  </s>
<s> This document is good for, but only fit for, internal consumption.? It's actually good stuff, for that use.? As a working baseline for development of the real stuff, which I agree the group has begun producing drafts of.? But it is not something we should embarrass Tim Berners-Lee by publishing by itself as W3C Recommendation.? There is no external audience for which it is an effective message.? It is only half of the appropriate effective message for any audience that I can imagine targeting.? It's good stuff as the corporate memory of the group that wrote it.??  </s>
<s> But that's it.? It's not a valid deliverable.? It is not an answer to any _stakeholder's_ problem.  </s>
<s> Please think again about the shape of what we think we are delivering.  </s>
<s> To whom are we delivering what we have learned??  </s>
<s> How does what we hand them slide effortlessly into their world?  </s>
<s> Just count up the number of voices that have asked "Who _are_ the audience for this deliverable?"? and you will have prima_facie evidence that the division laid out in our current plan for deliverables between part (a) and the rest would fail a consensus call, a vote of confidence, at this time.  </s>
<s> The agenda for the F2F should treat this matter as a question, not as a given, or we will most likely just prolong a frustrating level of wheel-spinning in the group.  </s>

<s> The UA document has not (and IMHO should not) attain the level of "recommendation" and their travails along this highway should serve notice that this might not be a road along which to continue: it no longer contains signs reading "this way to accessibility".  </s>
<s> The reason that UA is essentially an internal document is that there is no audience for it who is willing to pay any attention thereto.  </s>
<s> There's virtually no industry participation in that WG and precious little in this, although we have many friends/clients represented herein.  </s>
<s> As Al says, "It's good stuff as the corporate memory of the group that wrote it.  </s>
<s> But that's it.  </s>
<s> It's not a valid deliverable.  </s>
<s> It is not an answer to any _stakeholder's_ problem", and it is *their* problem that we are "raising money" for.  </s>
<s> The overhead isn't a burden but the absence of effect could be.  </s>
<s> The first rec did its job beyond some of our wildest dreams, spawning a new industry and creating a bevy of "508 ladies" in industry - an industry that had largely patted our clientele on the head and "admired their courage" sickeningly.  </s>
<s> Now is more like time to furnish guidance rather than guidelines.  </s>
<s> But then I ramble a lot in my creeping senility on Sunday mornings.  </s>
<s> Oh, and regrets for the F2F.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> Clearly what we currently have is not fit to be a recommendation as is.  </s>
<s> I don't think anyone in the group would even suggest that we hand over our current draft and ask for it to go to Last call as is.  </s>
<s> However, rather than burn down the foundations, I think we should do something like Jason suggests, and postpone some of this discussion.  </s>
<s> However, I think that in order to make that worthwhile, we need to have the technology-specific stuff - the bit that makes our work useful.  </s>
<s> And to do that we have to switch our focus, from the current part of the draft (formulating fairly abstract things) to a more mundane and practical one of identifying the problems, proposing solutions, and gathering these things.  </s>
<s> So on the one hand I propose that this group considers seriously that it should be looking at some more basic solutions to problems - producing what are called "techniques" in our jargon.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it is important not to lose sight of the big picture. the framework that we have, although rough, is a useful way of testing the techniques to make sure they don't produce more problems than they solve.  </s>
<s> And when we have enough of these for a few diffeernt types of problem space, we could re-examine the WCAG 2 document and see if it works well enough for all we have.  </s>
<s> The process of developing this stuff is iterative - try, test, think, revise, do it again.  </s>
<s> And again probably.  </s>
<s> There seems to be a subtext in some of this thread of "we are not getting there, and we are not going anywhere".  </s>
<s> That doesn't gel with my experience here - we are making progress, but I do believe that we need to assess where we put our priority for development work.  </s>

<s> Make of them what you like.  </s>
<s> I can think of lots of reasons for the infighting on this list that have nothing to do with the validity of the document.  </s>
<s> Even in this discussion, opinions seem to be lining up along well-established fronts.  </s>
<s> A comment that the Emperor has no clothes is worthless in and of itself.  </s>

<s> Al: "Kelly has shown us that The Emperor Has No Clothes." Reply: Kelly has shown no such thing.  </s>

<s> Why is the WCAG 2 only fit for internal consumption?  </s>
<s> How can you say that there is no external audience for which it is effective?  </s>
<s> Half an answer is still an answer.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the intention of the current split is to put the general portion of the answer into the WCAG and the specific portions in the various techniques documents.  </s>

<s> Reply: No, you'll have prima facie evidence that there is no agreement in this group on who is the intended audience.  </s>
<s> There's no obvious connection between a disagreement on audience and the division of the document into general and specific recommendations.  </s>
<s> Al: "The agenda for the F2F should treat this matter as a question, not as a given, or we will most likely just prolong a frustrating level of wheel-spinning in the group."  </s>
<s> Reply: I agree that the agenda for the F2F needs some work.  </s>
<s> We seem to have set aside lots of time to discuss specifics (and to hear what BG thinks we should be worrying about).  </s>
<s> I don't see any time set aside for discussion of much more fundamental issues -- issues upon which we seem to be unable to reach consensus.  </s>
<s> Without consensus on what the WCAG is and who it is for, the efforts to press forward with specifics -- while understandable -- may have the effect of creating a fait accompli for one point of view without the opposing points of view having had a fair hearing.  </s>
<s> What is clear to me from Al, William, and Jonathan's posts is that we do NOT have a consensus on the validity of our approach.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't we be devoting more time to the discussion of this before we rush forward with more detailed versions of our current design?  </s>
<s> I'd like to see some time set aside early on for this type of discussion.  </s>
<s> Chas.  </s>
<s> Munat  </s>
<s> we do NOT have a consensus on the validity of our approach.  </s>
<s> It's probably not the group's problem (approach validity) but a sort of "handicap" (in the horse-racing sense of extra weight in the saddle's pouches) imposed by W3C's chartering and process overhead.  </s>
<s> Just the idea of "normative" on something that won't even be around in a couple of years is just plain silly.  </s>
<s> It's like the "Device Independence" activity dealing so much with "devices" that will all be in dumpsters before the ink dries.  </s>
<s> To pretend that there's eternal verities (or lofty principles) guiding this stuff is to ignore that the entire medium is in its infancy.  </s>
<s> The principles are pretty clearly stated but "normative"?  </s>
