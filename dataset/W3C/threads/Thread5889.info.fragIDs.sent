<s> Hi Folks, I have several questions: 1. XML Schema distinguishes between "defining" and "declaring", e.g., you "define" types, but you "declare" elements.  </s>
<s> Does OWL make such a distinction?  </s>
<s> That is, do you "define" a class, or do you "declare" a class?  </s>
<s> Do you "define" a property, or do you "declare" a property?  </s>
<s> 2. Consider this ObjectProperty (er) definition from the OWL Guide: 1  </s>
<s> I have two questions about it: (a) How is it different than if rdfs:range had been used:  </s>
<s> 1  </s>
<s> If the two forms are equivalent, then when should each form be used?  </s>
<s> (b) I am struggling to understand why one would ever put a cardinality  </s>
<s> in a property definition - cardinality seems to me to be something that a class would want to assert, i.e., "when used in this class the property has a cardinality of 1". Can someone please elaborate upon when you would use cardinality in a property definition?  </s>
<s> Thanks! /Roger  </s>
<s> Roger, I inadvertently left you and public-webont-comments off my  </s>
<s> message [1] yesterday in response to your question.  </s>
<s> The WebOnt members meeting in Boston subsequently agreed that there are problems with several of the examples in  </s>
<s> Appendix C of the OWL Guide.  </s>

<s> Subject: ObjectProperty defined using rdfs:range, equivalent to using owl:allValuesFrom?  </s>

<s> OWL doesn't really have any notion of defining or declaring.  </s>
<s> There are some aspects of these, but really all you do is provide information about a class, a property, or an individual.  </s>
<s> This is an error in the Guide.  </s>
<s> Part of the meaning of this can be captured as but this misses the part that would appear to require that the property is total.  </s>
<s> If it was valid syntax, it should mean the same as if rdfs:range was used.  </s>
<s> Only one is possible.  </s>
<s> In general, global conditions of this sort are to be avoided.  </s>
<s> Instead use restrictions, which are local to classes.  </s>
<s> Sometimes, however, it is useful to provide a global domain or range.  </s>
<s> Also, some conditions on properties can only be stated globally, such as transitivity and inverse.  </s>
