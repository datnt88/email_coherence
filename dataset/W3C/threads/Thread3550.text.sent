Agreed and you can't assume that "no parking" would not apply so late in the evening. 
I got a very expensive ticket in NYC because I assumed that meters would not apply after 11pm. 
We had gone to chinatown for late dinner and it turns out you needed to put money in the meter through to midnight. 
Now I know that when they say the city never sleeps, they mean they tax you 24x7. 
The problem is really a pain when parking signs say something like: "No Parking: 8 PM to 12 PM" and you find out they meant noon, not midnight when you get the ticket on your windshield. 
Mike____ Hi, Good example. 
Note that translating Gozen and Gogo to AM and PM works out ok, but the 0:00 needs to convert to 12:00. 
Same confusion apparently exists in English, see excerpts from Heritage dictionary below. 
tex Time : To do Western/English GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast 8:00 A.M. GOGO 0:00 : Lunch 12:00PM GOGO 7:00 : Dinner 7:00 PM GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed 12:00AM P.M. also p.m. or P.M. abbr. 
post meridiem. 
Usage Note: By definition, 12 A.M. denotes midnight, and 12 P.M. denotes noon, but there is sufficient confusion over the meanings of A.M. and P.M. when the hour is 12 to make it advisable to use 12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is required. 
also a.m. or A.M.ante meridiem. 
Usage Note: By definition, 12 A.M. denotes midnight, and 12 P.M. denotes noon, but there is sufficient confusion over these uses to make it advisable to use 12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is required.

Here is my attempt to fill 4.2 intro section and 4.4.1 Pandora's box. 
-takao 4.2 Locale/Language Dependency in Message Exchange Patterns When exchanging a message, the requester and service that the requester accesses may have different default locales and language preferences. 
In addition, there may be more than one service involved in the message exchange. 
And there may be different requester, who consumes the message, who may expect different locale and language. 
Message exchange in components with different language and/or locales may result a failure or unexpected result. 
This section describes various message exchange patterns that need consideration or that have potential failure scenarios. 
4.4.1 
Using non-internationalized Data Structures A data structure may be provided without international considerations. 
This may happen, for instance, when a service was originally designed and targeted for a specific local market and later adopted to a global Web service. 
This is an example of my daily activity provided in Japanese 12 hour time scheme. 
Example: My schedule Time : To do GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast GOGO 0:00 : Lunch GOGO 7:00 : Dinner GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed GOZEN means "before noon", and generally corresponds to AM. GOGO means "after noon", and generally corresponds to PM. The problem is GOGO 0:00 is noon rather than 0:00 AM, and GOZEN 0:00 is midnight rather than 0:00 PM. 
This is confusing and conversion to internationally known time format may fail.

Making e-Business Work Around the World In this case, we should change the example from: Time : To do Western/English GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast 8:00 A.M. GOGO 0:00 : Lunch 12:00PM GOGO 7:00 : Dinner 7:00 PM GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed 12:00AM to: Time : To do Western/English GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast 8:00 A.M. GOZEN 12:00 : Lunch 12:00PM GOGO 7:00 : Dinner 7:00 PM GOGO 12:00 : Go to bed 12:00AM This will illustlate the original point much clearer. 
GOGO 0:00 is equal to GOZEN 12:00, and both mean Noon. 
GOZEN 0:00 is equal to GOGO 12:00, and both mean Midnight. 
Thanks the not put you The problem is really a pain when parking signs say something like: "No Parking: 8 PM to 12 PM" and you find out they meant noon, not midnight when you get the ticket on your windshield.

Thank you From a language standpoint, you are right, the second example points out the inconsistency between the two names. 
However from a "counting" standpoint, I thought it was interesting that the first example used 0:00 twice in 24 hrs rather than going from 0-23:59. 
Might point to errors that can occur even if an integer-only field was used to indicate time.
