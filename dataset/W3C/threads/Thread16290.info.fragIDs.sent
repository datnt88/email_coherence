<s> Hi, So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes.  </s>
<s> One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links.  </s>
<s> What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions.  </s>
<s> He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> Two other users forgot to make a choice.  </s>
<s> The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version.  </s>
<s> A couple of people commented that they would want some more text on the screen reader version.  </s>

<s> All, has anyone heard of www.esight.org?  </s>
<s> I looked at their site is it accessible?  </s>
<s> I don t know much about cold fusion sites so I can t tell.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Mike Burks  </s>
<s> All I get are the "notify" and "beta tester" links, which lead to forms to fill in the needed information.  </s>
<s> (These work as they should.)  </s>
<s> No word on what the site will actually do.  </s>
<s> Sounds like a lot of E-hype to me.  </s>

<s> I don't get any unusual code (other than the CFM declaration at the top).  </s>
<s> Otherwise it looks pretty normal, &amp; reads just fine with JFW3.5.  </s>
<s> A few small problems such as ALT text "pages\cleardot1.gif"  </s>
<s> (approx.), but nothing really unusual.  </s>
<s> Unless there is some CFM-generated applet thing happening that I'm missing completely.  </s>
