<s> "HTML tips to ensure your Web site is accessible (to everyone or everybody or to all)"  </s>
<s> I don't know about dropping the Quick in Quick Tips.  </s>
<s> It's kind a catchy as a name (the WAI Quicktips card).  </s>
<s> Adding "to xxx" might be possible, but by dropping a point size for the title.  </s>
<s> "See the complete guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI"  </s>
<s> Sounds OK.  </s>
<s> Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals.  </s>
<s> Some visuals create functionality.  </s>
<s> Other visuals are purely aesthetic, which may or may not be functional.  </s>
<s> Is it desirable that web-authors describe ALL visuals?  </s>
<s> "This is an aquamarine, 4-point line section-separator with ice cream and a cherry on top?" What do the guidelines say about this?  </s>
<s> Anyway, I propose: "Use the alt attribute to concisely describe visuals."  </s>
<s> The guidelines insists that what goes in the ALT is the function of the visual, not the description of the visual.  </s>
<s> So you don't find "this is a line of yellow duck", you find "" for ALT in that case.  </s>
<s> "MAP" and "link" must agree in number with Image Maps.  </s>
<s> Therefore: "Use client-side MAPs and text links for hotspots."  </s>
<s> Actually, it's one MAP with multiple hotspots.  </s>
<s> Does that change ?  </s>
<s> Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, and descriptions of video.  </s>
<s> Should it be captioning AND or captioning OR?  </s>
<s> I think it's both ?  </s>
<s> Use headings, lists, lang attribute, for structure.  </s>
<s> Use CSS for layout and style.  </s>
<s> Be consistent Use headings, lists, lang attribute and consistent structure.  </s>
<s> Use CSS for layout and style.  </s>
<s> I find the second example clearer.  </s>
<s> I would add "a" and "the" where needed to improve readibility.  </s>
<s> "Style" may be too techie; is "look-and-feel" better?  </s>
<s> Or just drop style -- CSS says it. "Use headings, lists, the lang attribute, and a consistent structure.  </s>
<s> Use CSS for layout."  </s>
<s> "Use headings, lists, the lang attribute, and a consistent structure.  </s>
<s> Use CSS to layout pages."  </s>
<s> I think Style is CSS is not obvious to everybody and needs to be mentioned.  </s>
<s> Adding articles is nice but it doesn't fit anymore.  </s>
<s> 5 Hypertext Links Use link text that makes sense when read out of context.  </s>
<s> Use meaningfull link text.  </s>
<s> No "Click Here".  </s>
<s> Use text that makes sense read out of context.  </s>
<s> "Use link text that makes sense when read out of context." or revisit the first draft: "Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone."  </s>
<s> I need to check if this last one would fit in 9 point.  </s>
<s> 6 Graphs &amp; Charts Provide summary or use longdesc attribute.  </s>
<s> Use summary or longdesc attribute.  </s>
<s> "Summarize the data, or use the longdesc attribute."  </s>
<s> The only reason I shortened this one is to fit in 9 pt.  </s>
<s> Please comment on whether or not you think it's worthwhile before proposing to re-add the text.  </s>
<s> 7 Scripts, Applets, &amp; Plug-ins Provide alternative representations in case active content is inaccessible or unsupported.  </s>
<s> Remove the comma after Applets, add "the" after "in case."  </s>
<s> I think we can drop "inaccessible."  </s>
<s> If scripts and applets were well-supported, they would be accessible.  </s>
<s> Can we leave out "active?"  </s>
<s> A browser can support something and this something is inaccessible, like JavaScript with OnMouseOver activation, or PlugIn in Shockwave.  </s>
<s> "Provide alternative representations in case the active content is unsupported."  </s>
<s> "Provide alternative representations in case the content is unsupported."  </s>
<s> "content unsupported" feels awkward.  </s>
<s> 8 Frames Label each frame with title or name attribute to allow access  </s>
<s> to individual pages.  </s>
<s> Label each frame with title or name attribute.  </s>
<s> Add "the" if it will fit: "Label each frame with the title or name attribute."  </s>
<s> I will check if it fits tomorrow (I'm home on a serial connection)  </s>
<s> 9 Tables Avoid using tables to format columns or navigation bars.  </s>
<s> Make cell by cell reading of tabular data sensible.  </s>
<s> Have data make sense when read cell by cell.  </s>
<s> Provide a Summary.  </s>
<s> Avoid using tables for columns.  </s>
<s> "Ensure that data makes sense when read cell by cell.  </s>
<s> Summarize.  </s>
<s> Use CSS to format columns."  </s>
<s> Issue with that is that CSS is not really supported everywhere for us to ask specifically to use it.  </s>
<s> 10 Check your work Validate the HTML &amp; CSS of your site.  </s>
<s> Test with images, sound, and animation off.  </s>
<s> Use evaluation tools to verify accessibility.  </s>
<s> Validate the HTML.  </s>
<s> Use evaluation tools and textual browser to verify accessibility.  </s>
<s> Change "textual" to "text."  </s>
<s> Last version has text-only.  </s>
<s> Is that better ?  </s>
<s> I would really like people to give opinion on the font size choice.  </s>
<s> Reply to: RE  WAI card - Font Size I agree with Charles (in this case, anyway), although I think the font and the amount of white space used on the pilot version makes the card quite readable already.  </s>
