Amaya's behaviour regarding trailing slashs in URL's is a real pain. 
Today I did the following: I entered http://www.geocities.com/emotionalism/dm and got 404 file not found Then I added a slash to the end of the URL (so that the address read After that Amaya refused to go back when I clicked on the back arrow in the toolbar.

I'm not concerned with whether this link exists or not. 
The problem is that Amaya considers both URL's (with and without trailing slash) the same, so I cannot go back in the history beyond that page because Amaya thinks that the page is already loaded.

When I tried to access these urls using Netscape, I also got a "not found" response.

Hello Karl-Michael, Thanks for your report. 
Your analysis is correct. 
First some context. 
When following a URL, Amaya always verifies that this URL is not shown in another window. 
If this is the case, Amaya just raises that window, rather than downloading the same page again. 
As Amaya is an editor, it's important not to open the same document twice on two windows, to avoid confusing the user. 
The problem comes from the function that verifies if the URL is already loaded (init.c:IsDocumentLoaded 
()), systematically adds a '/' to the URL we're trying to check. 
If you remove this concatenation, then your problem disappears. 
Why is this concatenation added? 
We think it was done for trying to save an extra request to the server. 
In principle, this is OK, but it shouldn't add the '/' char, Furthermore, the check should also happen after loading a URL, to take into account eventual URL rewrites on the server side. 
We made some experiments without the '/' contactenation and with the second check. 
Things seem to work better, but a bit more of work is needed, to avoid opening the same document in two windows. 
Because of the deadline for this release, we weren't able to fix up the '/' problem in time, so we decided to leave it as it is. 
We'll continue working on it so that this is solved for the next release. 
Thanks for your patience, -Jose In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said:
