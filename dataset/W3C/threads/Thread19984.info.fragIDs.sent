<s> Amaya's behaviour regarding trailing slashs in URL's is a real pain.  </s>
<s> Today I did the following: I entered http://www.geocities.com/emotionalism/dm and got 404 file not found Then I added a slash to the end of the URL (so that the address read After that Amaya refused to go back when I clicked on the back arrow in the toolbar.  </s>

<s> I'm not concerned with whether this link exists or not.  </s>
<s> The problem is that Amaya considers both URL's (with and without trailing slash) the same, so I cannot go back in the history beyond that page because Amaya thinks that the page is already loaded.  </s>
<s> Karl-Michael  </s>
<s> When I tried to access these urls using Netscape, I also got a "not found" response.  </s>

<s> Hello Karl-Michael, Thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> Your analysis is correct.  </s>
<s> First some context.  </s>
<s> When following a URL, Amaya always verifies that this URL is not shown in another window.  </s>
<s> If this is the case, Amaya just raises that window, rather than downloading the same page again.  </s>
<s> As Amaya is an editor, it's important not to open the same document twice on two windows, to avoid confusing the user.  </s>
<s> The problem comes from the function that verifies if the URL is already loaded (init.c:IsDocumentLoaded  </s>
<s> ()), systematically adds a '/' to the URL we're trying to check.  </s>
<s> If you remove this concatenation, then your problem disappears.  </s>
<s> Why is this concatenation added?  </s>
<s> We think it was done for trying to save an extra request to the server.  </s>
<s> In principle, this is OK, but it shouldn't add the '/' char, Furthermore, the check should also happen after loading a URL, to take into account eventual URL rewrites on the server side.  </s>
<s> We made some experiments without the '/' contactenation and with the second check.  </s>
<s> Things seem to work better, but a bit more of work is needed, to avoid opening the same document in two windows.  </s>
<s> Because of the deadline for this release, we weren't able to fix up the '/' problem in time, so we decided to leave it as it is.  </s>
<s> We'll continue working on it so that this is solved for the next release.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your patience, -Jose In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said:  </s>
