Hi, First of all, thanks to the Amaya team for this new version. 
I just gave a try to the new snapshot, with a special focus on table stuff. 
1) At first glance, I have noticed a weird bug. 
If I just create a new XHTML 1.1 document, add a table and give it a style="margin-left:20pt" and then a "width=100%", the bottom horizontal line of the border will extend far beyond to the right of the right border. 
The same defect shows in a printout of the document. 
I use the GTK binary version in Linux Redhat 8.0. 
It did not happen with GL version 8.2 on the same platform. 
2) At start, I have been missing the "Enter key functionnality in tables but I must acknowledge that the new interface offers more possiblities. 
As matter of fact having *both features*, the "Enter" behaviour for the regular table stuff and the new menus for special things would be make me happy. 
3) A more complicated document (I can send it off the list to anyone who is interested in) fails now to print. 
The generated PostScript is wrong at some point : an "ellipse" function (with a wrong number of arguments) is called for a list bullet for particular item when the "cer" function is called for all the other bullets ! 
Anyway, I think the layout problem is the most serious issue. 
Thanks to the Amaya team for this new version. 
Best regards Serge Torres

I guess the display is done too early when the table formating is not complete yet. 
I'll continue to work on this problem. 
The "Enter" key functionnality in tables is still available, but you have to select the cell (F2 or Esc keys let you do that selection) to create a new cell and its column, or a row to create a new row. 
With the previous approach, it was impossible to create empty paragraphs within a cell. 
I'm interested, of course.
