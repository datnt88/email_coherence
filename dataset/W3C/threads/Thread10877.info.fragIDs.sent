<s> If I understand correctly, * the stylesheet writer will explicitly have to have a declaration for every element with an element-content content-model to surpress the whitespace * OR we could make whitespace elimination the default in the stylesheet language in which case they would have to have an explicit declaration for every element that has mixed content so that whitespace will not be removed erroneously * OR the author must avoid all whitespace in element content.  </s>
<s> The first will make much larger stylesheets, with lots of repetition.  </s>
<s> The second will make larger (but perhaps not much larger) stylesheets, but is incompatible with DSSSL as it exists.  </s>
<s> The last is user-hostile.  </s>

<s> Are we satisfied with these ones?  </s>

<s> If there's no DTD, you simply throw all remaining (non-markup) bytes at the app, which should pop up a big red flag if it wants to be nice, otherwise just use some Microsoft/Netscape guesses about what the author must have had in mind...  </s>
