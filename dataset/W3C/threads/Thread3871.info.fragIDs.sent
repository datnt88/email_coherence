Yesterday's Functions and Operators draft still says to send comments to www-xml-query-comments@w3.org Presumably, that should be changed to public-qt-comments@w3.org 
Not surprisingly, the drafts that were not re-released yesterday 
(Requirements, Formal Semantics, and XQueryX) also still point to www-xml-query-comments@w3.org. 
Will they stay that way until the next release? 
Should commenters send to public-qt-comments anyway? 
The Use-cases draft gives the address as public-qt-comments@w3.org@w3.org 
The XSLT 2.0 draft doesn't appear to tell readers where to send their comments. 
At http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/, the link for "XSL" has an empty href. 
now "for submitting comments just to the XML Query wg. Please use this list only if you think the XML Query working group, and not the XSL working group, should be the recipient of the message." 
Any pointers on how to make that decision? 
I mean, of all the various Query drafts, if I were to pick a couple that I thought the XSL wg didn't need to see the comments on, I would guess the Uses-cases doc and the "XML Query Language" doc. 
But both of those docs tell me to send comments to public-qt-comments. 
So what's left? 
What would be of concern *only* to the Query wg? -Michael Dyck 
Hi Michael, Thanks for pointing out those inconsistencies. 
The Working Groups will discuss them and improve the situation. 
In the meantime send your 
comments to the list indicated in the relevant working draft. 
If you 
have more general comments that do not necessarily refer to a single 
document, send them to public-qt-comments@w3.org. 
The will always be people 
from both working groups reading it anyway and able to forward the comment 
to the appropriate group or subgroup. 
That was an error and it is now fixed. 
Thanks.

Yes, that's an unfortunate oversight. 
And that one's a typo. 
Sorry! 
Yes it does. 
Perhaps you were blinded by the bright green background. 
Two-thirds of the way down the Status section, it says: "Comments on this specification may be sent to public-qt-comments@w3.org; archives of the comments are available".

Michael: The F&amp;O draft went to press before the change in the comments list was announced. 
We'll fix in the next release.
