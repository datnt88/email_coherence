<s> > First define disability.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a "disability."  </s>
<s> Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have.  </s>
<s> Regardless if we call that a "disability" or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet.  </s>
<s> I think it's perfectly reasonable to define "accessibility" with having a strict definition of "disability" as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition.  </s>

<s> OK. Here's my short definition: "Disability is a design flaw in the environment."  </s>
<s> Here's the long version, from a chapter in an upcoming book on web-based training: "People are not "disabled."  </s>
<s> A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment.  </s>
<s> Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting.  </s>
<s> When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said to have a disability."  </s>
<s> You take your pick.  </s>
<s> If I were rewriting it, I would say something like this: ... ALL individuals, due to circumstance, accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks...

<s> I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability, but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page.  </s>
<s> That web author is "disabled" because he was _not able_ to make a correct web page.  </s>
<s> Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing?  </s>
<s> In no way is a user with a disability "disabled" on the web -- the sites THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not being accessible!  </s>
<s> We should identify the problem where it exists.  </s>
<s> The problem is not that there's anything "wrong with" the user, it is a problem with the page author and his output!  </s>
