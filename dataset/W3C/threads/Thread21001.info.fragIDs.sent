Hi again, I have been using amaya to edit CSS for a while now and have always had this problem. 
When I save the css document the editor scrolls to the top of the document, which makes me have to scroll back down a couple of pages after I've looked at any changes in the webpage, to return to where I was editing in the css file. 
This happens whenever I'm editing a css which is long enough to be scrollable across about 2 or more pages. 
I'm currently using Amaya 8.3 for Windows Xp, however I remember this artifact from 8.2 as well.

When you save the CSS file, Amaya reparses this CSS file and recomputes the CSS cascade for all open documents that link this CSS. 
This explains why other documents are reformatted and redisplayed. 
Why Amaya should do is to register the current position of the displayed document and to scroll automatically to that position when the document is redisplayed.

Yes, I think this is a good idea. 
That happens when I hit the Reload button. 
Oh, and I also have this suggestion: It seems hitting the Reload button causes the css editor to: 1. Reload the document (obviously ;) 2. Colorize any new /**/ comments. 
3. Scroll to the position where I was editing. 
I think that it would be great if points 2 and three would happen also when I save it! 
Another suggestion (this is a quite luxurious dream-feature ;): It would be really cool to be able to 'Contract' and 'Expand' multi-line style definitions in the CSS editor, kind of the thing Mozilla does with XML documents and some code editors can do with, for example, different methods. 
Illustration: - div.VMenu A { Color: Black; Background-color: White; Would when i click the Minus become (perhaps with an alternate color for easy spotting): + div.VMenu 
A Note: This would only be a visual presentation and should not alter the document buffer. 
Also (this is the last one, promise ;): Wouldn't it be great to have the Tab key add, say, two spaces right before the current insertion point (when editing Source code of Webdocuments and CSS) ? 
Regards Thomas.
