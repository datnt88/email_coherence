<s> (This step is done by the implementation technique described in the WD but is needed because of the non-normative dependency on n-triples.  </s>
<s> ARP for instance does not generate such IDs; whereas ARP within Jena does, as does ARP when used as an RDF/XML to N-triple filter.) Alternative wording which I like less, but is clearer than the current wording might be:  </s>

<s> The line [[The value begins with "_:".]] is implied by the N-triple production, so could be deleted.  </s>

<s> I have made no changes since then (waiting for updated staging area script).  </s>
<s> Yes, that's better than the existing words which tends to emphasis the wrong bit (ie not the generation).  </s>

<s> Even though that's basically my wording it's not working for me.  </s>
<s> I found the part of the sentence starting "with ..." seem to hang off the "generated" rather than the "given".  </s>
<s> Maybe swap "also generated" to "generated also"  </s>
<s> Yes looks good.  </s>

<s> Let me try again, although I'm losing the will to live at this point :)  </s>
<s> I don't think swapping the words you suggest would help but putting the sentence the other way around makes the correct parts associate.  </s>
<s> If no blank node identifier is given explicitly as an rdf:nodeID attribute value then one will need to be generated.  </s>
<s> (reminder, this is in 5.2, Blank Node Identifiers first sentence of last paragraph: plus maybe a reference forward to generated-blank-node-id() in 6.3.3  </s>

<s> OK that will do.  </s>
