<s> Email has to be viewed in fixed width formating...  </s>
<s> I have been thinking about this patent for a while and what seems to be very unique about it is that a file is downloaded and it is associated with an executable like MIME.  </s>
<s> My idea is why not remove the MIME resolution and do everything in a different combination.  </s>
<s> My idea is to make the browser dumb and run something called an Internet Archive automatically.  </s>
<s> So anybody, have a read and maybe comment... (Just an idea..) We create something called a Internet Archive.  </s>
<s> The Internet Archive is a file that acts like an file system within a file system.  </s>
<s> The Internet Archive has a fixed length header, and body.  </s>
<s> Within the header are references to other files of the archive.  </s>
<s> EG it would look as follows: "File system" 1 2 3 4 5 [Header ][12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890] a=1 b=17 c=39 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccc The HTTP Client and HTTP Server are HTTP 1.1 protocol.  </s>
<s> The HTML page contains a reference as follows When the client downloads the HTML page and hits the content tag the data is downloaded like an Image tag.  </s>
<s> The difference is the Internet Archive references a compressed set of files that the HTTP client knows about.  </s>
<s> This is similar to how a zip file.  </s>
<s> To ensure a certain level of security the file would be signed.  </s>
<s> What is special about the Internet Archive is that the first file in the archive is executable content like one would click on an icon on a desktop.  </s>
<s> Consider it like issueing an URL, not specifying the file desired and getting the default file (eg default.html).  </s>
<s> The client would download the content and then start the executable giving the executable a handle to the downloading(ed) archive.  </s>
<s> There is no resolution of mime types or anything along those lines, it is an automatic execution.  </s>
<s> Once the executable content has started and retrieves a handle to the Internet archive the running content would manipulate the archive data however it pleased.  </s>
<s> An optimization on the client side would be to cache Internet archives and the content that they reference.  </s>
<s> For example consider the following scenario.  </s>
<s> File: /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> [Header ][12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890] a=1 b=17 c=39 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccc File: /archive2.ia  </s>
<s> [Header ][12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890] a=1 D=17 c=39 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDccccccccccccc There are two Internet Archives, which reference the files a, b, c, and D. Using HTTP 1.1 the header of the Internet Archive would be downloaded first.  </s>
<s> The HTTP client would inspect which files are in the cache and which are not.  </s>
<s> Then using HTTP 1.1 the individual files would be downloaded using byte addressing.  </s>
<s> EG Downloading both Internet Archives would be done as follows: Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=1-32 Client has downloaded the header and is inspecting what to get Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=1-17 Client executes first file, and gives a handle to the Internet Archive, which is processed by the running executable Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=17-39 Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=39-50 Now user browses to different Web Page Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=1-32 Client has downloaded the header and is inspecting what to get Client retrieves content from cache Client executes first file, and gives a handle to the Internet Archive, which is processed by the running executable Http 1.1 Get /archive1.ia  </s>
<s> ranges-specifier = 1=17-39 Client retrieves content from cache The identification of the files could be considered like cookies or URL references.  </s>
<s> An optimization could even to rename the Internet Archive with a new URL... Eg IA://archive1/identifier Where running the URL IA://archive1 would automatically download and execute the "default file" Christian Gross  </s>
<s> Download a compressed archive of files containing executable code?  </s>
<s> Sounds like a JAR file to me.  </s>
<s> I'd be very interested to see the web entirely based on a  </s>
<s> platform-independent programming language instead of a text markup language, but I don't think it would actually be a good approach.  </s>
<s> -Jake  </s>
<s> It is similar to a jar...  </s>
<s> The entry point of the archive is the first file, so that there is no resolution necessary.  </s>
<s> The difference is that not the entire jar file is downloaded.  </s>
<s> Only what is necessary is downloaded.  </s>
<s> Imagine putting shockwave into every archive, when the content to play is only 5KB.  </s>
<s> That would be an incredible download hit.  </s>
<s> Ok an HTTP 1.0 server would have to download the Internet Archive each and every time.  </s>
<s> But by using HTTP 1.1, only the necessary bits are downloaded, hence saving bandwidth.  </s>
<s> We already have it... It is called Java, and .NET.  </s>
<s> How could this Internet Archive work.  </s>
<s> Lets say I am using IE or Mozilla and I want to download an applet.  </s>
<s> The Internet Archive file would contain the Java Applets, and the runtime.  </s>
<s> The runtime would execute the Java Application.  </s>
<s> While the size of the Internet Archive will be in the megabytes, it is irrelevant because the size of the file is virtual.  </s>
<s> The HTTP 1.1 protocol would use ranges to download the bits it needs.  </s>
<s> The trick is that the archive would be created dynamically on the server side using MIME encoding.  </s>
<s> You would create a file, reference the runtime bits and let the HTTP server take care of the rest.  </s>
<s> So the resolution still happens, but the Internet Archive delegates the resolution to the server, unknown entirely to the client and to the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> It is an implementation detail... Christian Gross  </s>
<s> I said "entirely".  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Back in January 1996 while working with Alfred Aho on my soon to be aborted PhD, I developed the Content Handler Internet Protocol (CHIP).  </s>
<s> The goal was to allow content providers to distribute platform independent documents which could be bound at run-time to different viewers based upon the capabilities of the platform the document was to be viewed on.  </s>
<s> A CHIP Server could be a centrally available service belonging to an administrative organization or could be co-located on the content server.  </s>
<s> I was attempting to solve the problem of heterogenous systems plus ensuring that older versions of documents could be viewed in their native viewers as newer versions with backward compatibility or conversion modes are often lossy in the translation.  </s>
<s> The CHIP worked is as follows.  </s>
<s> The client negotiates the Platform (OS, Hardware Architecture, Applications, Versions) and the Document datatypes (MIME, file extensions, versions) with the CHIP server.  </s>
<s> The server in turn distributes to the client the appropriate executables (viewers, interpretters, agents) and installation processes; or a referral to another server to be checked.  </s>
<s> After viewing the client could keep the executables until the next time they were required or discard them.  </s>
<s> The reason I bring this up is that even if the necessary software to view the document was already installed on the client, the decision of which software should be used to view a given document was pushed back to a remote server.  </s>
<s> The client (a browser) does not make the decision locally.  </s>
<s> It simply executes what it was given.  </s>
<s> This would seem to work around the Eolas patent.  </s>
