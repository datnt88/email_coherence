To the people of WCAG, Many sites use small buttons, menus or tabs that have text as images, e.g. FAQs, Our Team, About Us, Consumer Products, Web Sites, Computers, Welcome, News, How-to, Connect, (this is a mixture from several web sites) Do these pass the following priority 2 checkpoint? 
[1] 3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information. 
[Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and style sheets to format text and control layout. 
Also, avoid using images to represent text -- use text and style sheets instead. 
I contend no, small image buttons/menus/tabs fail this checkpoint: since an accessible markup exists, viz. 
ordinary HTML. 
Plus the last sentence explicitly says to not use images for text. 
Feasible methods exist. 
You can get rid of the link underline, and control color and font with a stylesheet. 
Rectangular buttons are easy. 
If you want something a bit fancier like rounded corners, it's straightforward to piece together the text parts with slivers of images. 
That's a bit of a kluge, but in balance I think it's better than making the whole thing text, given the importance of that checkpoint to people with low vision, who can otherwise simply enlarge the fonts and/or change the colors. 
(Loads faster too). 
I expect some objections to this position, since a number of well known sites in the disability area use such images, so there are clearly folks who didn't think this was a violation. 
By the way, the one place I would allow text as images are in logos, where there are substantial reasons for making the look exact.

This isn't an academic question for me: e.g. full WCAG is now Pennsylvania State Policy, so we've got to know if image folkder tabs are "legal".

However, it's better to use HTML text, and let the user control the size, font, and color of the text directly, instead of using images text and a magnifier. 
It's not just preference, convenience or even cost. 
HTML text is a better accommodation for low vision, and has additional advantages when the user has motor or cognitive disabilities. 
Note that this lets people who need small text to use it, while letting other folks enlarge the text. 
I addressed this earlier, but unfortunately this discussion has gotten spread among so many lists that not everyone in the current discussion saw my answer [1] Here's the problem with screen magnifiers compared to HTML text. 
1. 
When you use a screen magifier, you have to scoll left and right in addition to up and down, because the screen expands into a virtual space larger than your screen. 
If the screen itself has a scrollbar, you're using two scrolling mechanisms. 
This significanttly adds difficulty in terms of keystrokes and in terms of "knowing where you are". 
It's a signficant problem for anyone, and is even more of a difficulty for someone who has a motor or cognitive impairment. 
On the other hand, if you design a page right, when you have real text and let the user enlarge fonts, the text simply wraps at the right margin and you don't run into this problem. 
All you have to deal with is the vertical scrollbar on the regular window. 
2. With a screen magnifier and image text, user is no longer able to control the font. 
Some fonts are better than others. 
With HTML text, the user can control the fonts. 
3. Some people with low vision need reverse contrast. 
If the buttons are already reverse contrast, then if they reverse the whole screen to read other body text, the buttons get normal contrast. 
So they have to keep flipping the contrast depending on where they are. 
4. 
Similarly, if all you can do is an overall screen color map, you can't get all the text, buttons and body, to have optimal color. 
Bottom line: HTML text is not mere pandering to preference, vanity, convenience, or even cost: it's a superior accommodation.

I explained this in the message. 
what I disagree with is that the text can be small. 
some people have low enough vision that they need larger text but not use assistives to achieve it. 
Isn't this like saying some people need glasses but are too vain to wear them? 
The advantage of the small text and small buttons is that these elements can be present on a page without taking up space needed to present the meat of the page on the opening screen.

No one is actually disputing that. 
(Indeed, Edapta's web morphing service explicitly replaces images with styled textual equivalents when edapting pages for many audiences, as well as providing the capacity to create variant-size button sets.) However, it is important to recognize that HTML + CSS is _not_ a workable general replacement for images as text. 
Most graphical web designers will _not_ accept styled text as a solution because of the following: (1) CSS is not widely implemented yet and excludes older browsers. 
(2) CSS support on Netscape (and to a lesser extent, IE) is seriously buggy and cannot be relied upon. 
(3) Graphical designers may have valid reasons for desiring a specific font that is not widely available (and thus styles are not acceptable). 
(4) There are a number of effects available in images which cannot be replicated by using styled text. 
As examples, consider drop shadows on text, or mouseover "glow auras". 
My personal philosophy regarding web accessibility is that "we" (the people who understand accessibility principles and in some cases write the guidelines) should _not_ be telling a web designer that she should "stop using that." 
Instead, we should tell her how to "make it accessible", whatever she's using. 
(Be it Flash, animated GIFs, Streaming Audio, etc.) It is "our" responsibility (as informed advocates for web accessibility) to provide the right answers, and we have a responsibility to not leave the web designer hanging -- it is not acceptable to say "don't use that thing which meets your needs, instead use this method which will not." 
I suggest therefore that instead of looking for ways to _forbid_ textual images, we should rather concentrate our energies on ways to make textual images more accessible. 
That may require user agent guidelines, it may require web content guidelines, but simply throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not sufficient. 
Let's be realistic here, folks -- we _cannot_ force most web designers to give up their textual images. 
If that is a requirement for double-A accessibility, then _web designers will not design double A sites_, period. 
If given a choice between the benefits of graphical text (and you are living in denial if you claim there there are not benefits from a design standpoint!) and accessibility, accessibility _will lose_. 
Bottom line: We should _not_ be forcing web designers to have to make that choice! 
_We_ should be out finding the way to "do it right" rather than trying to say "don't do it at all."

However, it is important to recognize that HTML + CSS is _not_ a workable general replacement for images as text. 
Nor is "image as text" a workable replacement for "text as text". 
Apples, oranges, William. 
At some point in the so-called "design process" that text that became "image-text" was actual "text - text". 
Just as the PDF text or table was once not a "scanned-type" of text. 
The proportion of today's text that is not at some point in its career in digital (dare I even say it "ascii") form is miniscule. 
I don't know why "image text" is any different than any other image in requiring a text equivalent? 
In short I think this is already covered early in the guidelines. 
I think you may be missing the point -- the discussion has not been about "should image text require a text equivalent", it was "should image text be thrown out entirely for double-A compliance". 
Let me repeat "image-text is in fact image". 
I don't think anyone is claiming it's not, so I'm not sure you need to make this point so forcefully.

The fact that it's an image of text is of no consequence, it's still "image" - full stop. 
The image of a book cover with the author's name in some supposedly artistic font is an image, not text. 
The author's name need not even be in the alt-text if the designer doesn't think it's important to serve as a replacement for the image of the book cover. 
The designer need not explain that "the eerie mysticism of the illustration has been enhanced by the selection of a font that..." That's up to the designer. 
If she can suffer the belief that the proper replacement text for the missing image is "book cover" then so be it. 
If semantics is involved we are in another venue. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I think you may have missed _my_ point... Nope. 
Everyone's missing the "point" - there is no such entity as "image text". 
When an image is made of em strong anything /em /strong it becomes "image" and must endure the same requirements whether it is an image of text or an image showing apples vs. oranges. 
It requires a textual equivalent. 
KB:: "I don't think anyone is claiming it's not, so I'm not sure you need to make this point so forcefully. 
:)" WL: The reason I'm sure that I do need to make the point "forcefully" is that somehow it has been allowed to slip by that images of text are a special case of images. 
They are not. 
IMO this also goes for PDF. 
The clear purpose of the guidelines applicable to this entire genre is that if there's any semantics in there it must be teased out. 
If not, then... Love.
