<s> An example of Javascript functions that are useful is form validation.  </s>
<s> This is fairly common - you fill out a form, and in a javascript-enabled browser, it checks for errors before sending the form for processing.  </s>
<s> So long as there is an equivalent for non script-enabled browsers, there isn't a problem.  </s>
<s> We tend not to use scripts much in W3C content, and theese are generally written for a specific purpose.  </s>
<s> scripts to provide things like sound interaction would be useful examples - I will look at the examples you have mentioned.  </s>

<s> if you are using client-side form validation, whether it be javascript or other methods, you need to have server-side form validation installed for those who have problems, no scripting or disabled scripting..  </s>
<s> i see this was cross-posted and am replying to both.  </s>
<s> I'd add, those who are not permitted to use scripting.  </s>
<s> This is probably not a problem for Jon's target audience.  </s>
<s> Their problem is that they are probably particularly vulnerable to scripting based security vulnerabilities as they may have difficulty learning when it is and is not safe to override security warnings, or recognizing when the browser is doing something that is unreasonable for the request made, and in keeping completely up to date with Microsoft Critical Updates, and Netscape's equivalents.  </s>
<s> The other reason for validating is that malicious users can bypass any forms or client side validation and submit completely bogus responses in an attempt to subvert security on the server.  </s>
<s> I think, though, that Jon is mainly interested in the use of scripts to "enhance" the "user experience" and would be better off pursuing these questions in non-accessibility forums, where finding hacks to make things work on all recent versions of Netscape and IE are fairly standard questions.  </s>
<s> (Actually, I think he would be better trying to find a language designed for multimedia presentations.  </s>
<s> A lot of these problems are the result of choosing a language that was designed for a different purpose, simply because an interpreter for that language can be assumed to be on all, vaguely recent, PCs.)  </s>
<s> Unfortunately these mailing lists behave like moderated, albeit auto-moderated, newsgroups, on which the rules is that you do not cross-post to moderated groups.  </s>
<s> The moderators of these lists, who get articles from non-subscribers, tend not to enforce this sort of policy, but it still results in delays in the non-subscribed groups.  </s>
<s> Unlike USENET, the article is not held back in all lists until authorised.  </s>
