Does anyone know how other user agents use the title attribute in anchor elements? 
I know that IE displays the title in a "tool tip", and it seems like it would be a good way to provide additional information to help the user decide whether to follow the link. 
I tried using JAWS, and JAWS seems to just read the title, and not the actual link text. 
Homepage reader seemed 
to ignore the title text altogether. 
The W3C's site (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-title ) says that title text may be presented by screen readers in a manner similar to a tool tip, but I doubt that the intent is to exclude the link text. 
It seems that, at least for JAWS users, the title text should be the same as the text of the hyperlink, but this seems redundant. 
Anyone have any additional information?

Ignoring the title attribute isn't great, but it's better than JAWS' approach IMHO, since the title attribute is meant to have "additional" information losing it is a disadvantage, but shouldn't be a show-stopper, whereas if you get the title in place of the link text you are potentially replacing crucial information with merely helpful "bonus" information. 
Since the title attribute may not be understandable outside of the context of the element it applies to this seems to be a design-flaw. 
Do any JAWS users know if this is something that can be changed through settings?

Hi, JAWS has a setting to control when the title tag is read. 
It can be set to read what is called screen text, alt tag or title, or the longer of the two. 
This is controled with the verbosity menu (insert-v from within IE). 
This only takes effect when using the JAWS virtual PC in line by line reading. 
When tabbing, JAWS always seems to read the title tag.

Home Page Reader will speak the title attribute on links. 
There may be some bugs in the behavior currenlty. 
Try the "Where am I" and "Information View" for "additional information" like title attributes.

A tool tip is currently exported by most GUI objects (in MFC, Swing, etc.) as the accessible description or textual representation for an object. 
Thus having the title attribute override the default textual representation (in this case the link text) actually is the desired behavior. 
Further utilizing the title attribute effectively can allow page authors to update the textual representation of an object via JavaScript and inform the user of an event that dynamically (client side) changes the content of the page. 
Consider a few super useful thing you could do with title, without 
changing the way a page looks, that are tremendously helpful for assistive technology users: 
a href="javascript:openHelpWindow('help.html')" title="This link opens up a help window" Help /A 
span onkeypress="postForm()" onmouseclick="postForm" title="Save my changes to the server" Save /span or my personal favorite for JavaScript expanding / collapsing menus: a href="javascript:expand(this)" title="Menu item (Collapsed)" Menu Item /A in the expand function we set the title attribute so that after the event fires we have The visual appereance updates are now matched (via JavaScript) to the textual representation, as exported by the title attribute. 
For comment: We currently make extensive use of the title attribute to describe any events that an element triggers on the page. 
This is the best programatic solution we (SSB) have found for explaining visual events (and the resulting page state changes) to non-visual users. 
This is currently implemented in all our tools and produces the desired effect in the assistive technologies we have tested in (primarily JAWS). 
Does anyone know of a better way to do this?

You're forgetting that not only is a link an object on the page, it is also, in many cases, text. 
A link may function as an item in a list, a "button" (text or graphic), or some other stand-alone entity on a page. 
In such cases, it might make sense for the title to be read instead of the link text. 
But very commonly, a link is one or more words in the middle of a paragraph. 
When that occurs, reading the title attribute and ignoring the text is absolutely not the desired behavior. 
I'd actually consider it brain-dead behavior on the part of whatever tool does this.

Wrong. 
This link is a dead link for anyone without Javascript or who wants to operate securely. 
It is also invisible to search engines. 
It is a WCAG failure - priority 1, I think. 
If you have to do this, do it like this: a href="help.html" 
onclick="openHelpWindow('help.html'); return false" href="help.html" 
title="Help on how to use this page (pops-up if Javascript enabled)" Help /A Your others examples suggest that you fail the "provide alternatives to scripting" multiple times. 
Lynx uses it as a provisional name for a link in its table of links display (I think IE may do the same) until the user loads the referenced page and it can extract the title information. 
That seems a very reasonable thing to do, for me. 
I would expect a link title to contain either the title of the target page (possibly in context - real titles need to stand alone in bookmark files and search engine results) or a very short abstract 
of the content of the referenced page (the page title should, in 
effect, be an even shorter abstract).

When you have a textual link that has link text that is descriptive enough you would not include a title. 
When the link text is insufficient to communicate function you would override it with a title. 
What we are talking about is the ability to override the default text of a link in the case that the text does not accurately describe what a link does.

Apologies. 
I forgot that this was the W3C list. 
My comments were addressed more towards making this "work" and less to the W3C compliant solution. 
Our focus is the Section 508 guidlines and making "functional text" available to assistive technologies. 
Further discussion should probably be carried out on the trace list.

I think you're missing my point. 
A textual link can serve two purposes: 1 - A link (and information about what's at the other end of that link) 2 - Text that provides valuable information in the context of the current document Let's assume there's a paragraph of text. 
In the middle of that paragraph, there is a phrase that could link to additional information. 
It's not the main purpose of the current page, it's just one item that appears in the document that users might want to learn more about. 
So, the web designer makes that phrase a link to another web site that contains good information on the topic. 
Being a considerate web designer, he includes a title that says something like title="Link to XYZ corporation's information about topic X" so that users will understand that this is an off-site link, not a link to a definition or some other internal information. 
How should a user agent (screen reader or speech-based browser) handle this? 
Should the agent: a - read just the link text, and ignore the title? 
Of course not - the title contains useful information. 
b -read just the title, ignoring the link text? 
Again, of course not - the title may be more useful in the context of describing the function of the link, but the title is not useful in the context of the current document. 
The original link text is what's needed. 
A user agent should read both the text of the link, and any title associated with it, not substitute one for the other.

The title attribute is not the same thing as a toolTip, although a toolTip is a sensible rendering of the title in some contexts. 
[useful things to do with title snipped] That is indeed useful. 
However I may wish to have the following: p The a href="whatever.html" 
title="United States homepage of the company" company /a was set up in Ireland in 1934. 
/p Here title is doing it's job correctly, but rendering it as "The United States homepage of the company was set up in Ireland in 1934." is not correct (though it would certainly be great one-up-manship amongst those who boast about how long they've been using the web!). 
As it is title is a useful tool for making pages more accessible, but to really do it's job we need ways for user agents to interpret it without replacing the rest of the text in the link.
