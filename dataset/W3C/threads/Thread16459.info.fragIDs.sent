<s> The W3C's site (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-title ) says that title text may be presented by screen readers in a manner similar to a tool tip, but I doubt that the intent is to exclude the link text.  </s>
<s> It seems that, at least for JAWS users, the title text should be the same as the text of the hyperlink, but this seems redundant.  </s>

<s> Ignoring the title attribute isn't great, but it's better than JAWS' approach IMHO, since the title attribute is meant to have "additional" information losing it is a disadvantage, but shouldn't be a show-stopper, whereas if you get the title in place of the link text you are potentially replacing crucial information with merely helpful "bonus" information.  </s>

<s> You're forgetting that not only is a link an object on the page, it is also, in many cases, text.  </s>
<s> A link may function as an item in a list, a "button" (text or graphic), or some other stand-alone entity on a page.  </s>
<s> In such cases, it might make sense for the title to be read instead of the link text.  </s>
<s> But very commonly, a link is one or more words in the middle of a paragraph.  </s>
<s> When that occurs, reading the title attribute and ignoring the text is absolutely not the desired behavior.  </s>
<s> I'd actually consider it brain-dead behavior on the part of whatever tool does this.  </s>

<s> I think you're missing my point.  </s>
<s> A textual link can serve two purposes: 1 - A link (and information about what's at the other end of that link) 2 - Text that provides valuable information in the context of the current document Let's assume there's a paragraph of text.  </s>
<s> In the middle of that paragraph, there is a phrase that could link to additional information.  </s>
<s> It's not the main purpose of the current page, it's just one item that appears in the document that users might want to learn more about.  </s>
<s> So, the web designer makes that phrase a link to another web site that contains good information on the topic.  </s>
<s> Being a considerate web designer, he includes a title that says something like title="Link to XYZ corporation's information about topic X" so that users will understand that this is an off-site link, not a link to a definition or some other internal information.  </s>
<s> How should a user agent (screen reader or speech-based browser) handle this?  </s>
<s> Should the agent: a - read just the link text, and ignore the title?  </s>
<s> Of course not - the title contains useful information.  </s>
<s> b -read just the title, ignoring the link text?  </s>
<s> Again, of course not - the title may be more useful in the context of describing the function of the link, but the title is not useful in the context of the current document.  </s>
<s> The original link text is what's needed.  </s>
<s> A user agent should read both the text of the link, and any title associated with it, not substitute one for the other.  </s>
