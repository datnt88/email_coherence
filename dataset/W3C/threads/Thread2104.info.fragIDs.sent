<s> Anybody got a server doing digest auth ala the March 24 draft?  </s>
<s> I just put it in emacs-w3, and need to test it.  </s>
<s> MDA is next.  </s>

<s> According to wmperry@spry.com:  </s>
<s> Yes, you can try URL:http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/simp/ which is protected by Digest authentication.  </s>
<s> Use username "Mufasa" and password "CircleOfLife" (with no quotation marks).  </s>
<s> NOTE: You won't be able to access this without a browser supporting Digest Authentication!  </s>
<s> This is an implementation of the spec at authentication module for use with the WN server.  </s>
<s> The code (except for MD5 from RSA) is in the public domain.  </s>
<s> While designed for use with WN it should not be too difficult to modify for other servers.  </s>
<s> The best way to get this code is get the WN distribution at ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/wn/wn.tar.gz and extract the files from the directory named "experimental."  </s>

<s> And... he shooots.... and SCORES!  </s>
<s> Cool, it works.  </s>
<s> :) Thanks for the various pointers everyone.  </s>
<s> Ok, now does anyone have an MDA server up and running yet?  </s>

<s> I saw you got it working with WN -- just for the sake of multiple test cases, try:  </s>

<s> D'ohhh!  </s>

<s> On the contrary -- it works just fine, sortof :-).  </s>
<s> I did forget to mention that this particular server requires the Extension: Security/Digest header, as mentioned in the draft.  </s>
<s> If you send that header along, it will function correctly.  </s>
<s> It's behavior without the header is kind of questionable.  </s>
