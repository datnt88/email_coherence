Anybody got a server doing digest auth ala the March 24 draft? 
I just put it in emacs-w3, and need to test it. 
MDA is next.

According to wmperry@spry.com: 
Yes, you can try URL:http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/simp/ which is protected by Digest authentication. 
Use username "Mufasa" and password "CircleOfLife" (with no quotation marks). 
NOTE: You won't be able to access this without a browser supporting Digest Authentication! 
This is an implementation of the spec at authentication module for use with the WN server. 
The code (except for MD5 from RSA) is in the public domain. 
While designed for use with WN it should not be too difficult to modify for other servers. 
The best way to get this code is get the WN distribution at ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/wn/wn.tar.gz and extract the files from the directory named "experimental."

And... he shooots.... and SCORES! 
Cool, it works. 
:) Thanks for the various pointers everyone. 
Ok, now does anyone have an MDA server up and running yet?

I saw you got it working with WN -- just for the sake of multiple test cases, try: 
username Timon password HakunaMatata

On the contrary -- it works just fine, sortof :-). 
I did forget to mention that this particular server requires the Extension: Security/Digest header, as mentioned in the draft. 
If you send that header along, it will function correctly. 
It's behavior without the header is kind of questionable. 
This is just a copy of NCSA httpd 1.3 which I hacked to support Digest.
