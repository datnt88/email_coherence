<s> Implementing a specific expression language binding should be optional, with at least 1 of the available expression languages.  </s>
<s> compare it to DOM which might offer XSL besides CSS.  </s>
<s> I believe CSS is optional... i.e. the core DOM only consists of basically DOM1.  </s>
<s> Can someone on the DOM WG confirm this?  </s>
<s> I don't think a DOM implementor should be required to implement any expression language.  </s>
<s> (or I might be misunderstanding what you are saying...)  </s>
<s> Thats not what I meant, I meant that we should use the same mechanisme as dom does where you have a DOM compliance implementation if you implement the core + 1 of the extended interfaces.  </s>
<s> If you split up PAX in a PAX core and expression specific interfaces you can use  </s>

<s> Additional features: A separate Expression.parseExpression()  </s>
<s> DOMException PARSE_EXCEPTION might be usefull.  </s>
<s> Given create(String expression, PrefixResolver prefixResolver), do you really think so?  </s>
<s> I still think so but you might call it something like "ValidateExpression".  </s>
<s> The purpose was not to precompile stuff separately but to validate the expression separately without executing it.  </s>
<s> Do you think more needs to be put on the Inquirer interface, like boolean getBool(String queryString); boolean getMatch(String queryString); ?? It's supposed to be minimal though, so maybe not.  </s>

<s> ExpressionFactory efactory = ExpressionFactory.newInstance("Xpath");  </s>
<s> In yours, you have to have exposure to a specific interface for XPathExpression.  </s>
<s> In mine, the interface is obtained at runtime, based on a property registration mechanism, and the interface is abstract.  </s>

<s> "ValidateExpression".  </s>
<s> Can you give a use case?  </s>
<s> -scott  </s>
<s> If you set it up like dom2 than an implementation is DOM-PAX compliant if it implements the PAX-CORE interface and at least one PAX-Expression module interface.  </s>
<s> Variable, Variable lists can be shared among Expression modules (f.i. xpath) and should therefore be in the PAX-core interface;.  </s>
<s> ExpressionFactory efactory = ExpressionFactory.newInstance("Xpath");  </s>
<s> That's the difference, the same thing is done in DOM level 2. You don't have a createNode("Element"), createNode("Attr") in DOM it is done through createElement, createAttr...  </s>
<s> This enables you to vary the variablelist of a specific expression language create.  </s>
<s> DOMmish... ehhh I meant it "feels" like DOM. (don't ask me for a definition of "feels like DOM" ;-))  </s>
<s> That's what I meant but I agree it isn't a strong point, what I had in mind was that in certain programming languages you're not able to create an instance based on a string but there are simple workarounds.  </s>
<s> In company A, employee "clever" is creating an expression for employee "dummer" which he validates before shipping it to "dummer".  </s>
<s> "dummer" executes the expression.  </s>
<s> Compare it to compile time errors and runtime errors in a programming environment.  </s>
