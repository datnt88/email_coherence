Hi lists if (.) then else I could use elsif if (.) then elsif else 
It doesn't matter to me if it's called "elsif" or "elseif".

Would it matter to you if it was spelt "else if"? 
Michael Kay 
I guess you imply that this is currently possible?: if (.) then else if (.) else if (.) else Tobi 
Sorry; I meant if (.) then else if (.) then else if (.) then else Tobi
