<s> Hi: I searched the mailing list for this but didn't see any reference to it.  </s>
<s> I tried a few things: - Substituting 'bash' for 'sh' in configure  </s>
<s> - Using 'gsed' instead of 'sed' So, some other weirdness is afoot.  </s>
<s> Maybe quoting perhaps?  </s>

<s> On some platforms we launch "make SHELL=/usrbin/bash" to solve the shell problem.  </s>

<s> I stand corrected.  </s>
<s> I eventually did find references to the error, but none of the workarounds posed work.  </s>
<s> I can't do a 'make', because I have no Makefiles.  </s>
<s> Using GNU sed on FreeBSD doesn't solve the problem as far as I can tell.  </s>
<s> The FreeBSD team maintains a port for Amaya, but it's the older 6.4 release.  </s>

<s> The solution is not necessarily to rebuild configure from configure.in  </s>
<s> (although I did throughout this process).  </s>
<s> I ended up having to do a full text search and replace of all calls to sed with gsed throughout the configure script.  </s>
<s> I did this because not all references to sed are eliminated just because you put gsed in configure.in.  </s>
<s> The problem is apparently a little more fundamental than that.  </s>
<s> This is obviously a band-aid, but I'm not going to sift through the spaghetti known has configure.  </s>
<s> Anyway, it's working now.  </s>
<s> Thanks, -Clint  </s>

<s> Makefiles are generated by ../configure (see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html)  </s>
<s> I will inform maintainers about the new release 7.1.  </s>
