<s> I know we talked about the marketing advantages of the database and the incentive it may give developers to make their tools conform to WAI guidelines.  </s>
<s> I realize we won't give anything a formal "WAI seal of approval" or "official evaluation tool of the WAI" but if someone searches for Level A compliant tools they will basically be finding those tools that we deem WAI conformant.  </s>

<s> WC:: "Will tool developers see a difference?" WL: Yes, because it will have lots of disclaimers and notice that this is the "opinion of _____" and not to be taken as approval... Also these "reviews" will be made by anyone *including the developers.  </s>

<s> I definitely don't think it's something an interest group can/should do, especially when we are dealing with "subjective" criteria.  </s>
<s> At one time there was talk of the W3C investigating the possibility of a "conformance claims" activity of some kind -- what became of that?  </s>

<s> Next of Kynn: a quasi-regular web log http://www.kynn.com/next/  </s>
<s> Crossposted to AU and ER Len identifies some important points.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> It is indeed useful to identify what tools meet the requirements.  </s>
<s> In fact, W3C process requires that this can be done for a recommendation.  </s>
<s> So we have two options - we can build the tools ourselves, or find tools that already implement the requirements.  </s>
<s> It is also useful for developers, who are trying to meet the guidelines, to have more guidance about what that means.  </s>
<s> Seeing the opinions of the working group is helpful in this regard.  </s>
<s> For the working group to have a good idea of how to make decisions on "line calls", and even more so for others, it is helpful to have a number of such decisions available to refer to.  </s>
<s> 2. There are indeed questions about what does "integrated into the look and feel mean".  </s>
<s> Again, the best way I know of to clarify this is by trying it.  </s>
<s> Some of the other cases, like the relative priority checkkpoints, are less complicated.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of work to test each one, but it is explained under relative priority that what is required is based on the checkpoints of WCAG.  </s>
<s> Developing techniques, and tests, is a lot of the current work in front of the AU group.  </s>
<s> 3. Vendor neutral is not the same as issue neutral, or silent.  </s>
<s> W3C is certainly not in a position to sit down and work on their favourite vendor's tools, or say that someone's software is all terrible.  </s>
<s> However, in order to demonstrate what we mean by the specification, in informative examples, it is reasonable to publish opinions expressed about how a particular tool does or does not meet the requirements, along with any subsequent debate on the issue.  </s>
<s> Not to do so would be tantamount to claiming the specification is perfect, and anyone who doesn't understand it is inadequate, which is likely to be almost diametrically wrong.  </s>
<s> Our comments, if we are working in good faith, are not likely to provide undeserved praise or blame in any great degree, and as a working group it is our job to watch over ourselves and each other, and test what we say against reality.  </s>
<s> I believe we are in fact capable of doing so (although I recognise that it is important to bear this in mind, and recall that we are none of us infallible).  </s>
<s> On another front, in the ER response to this thread, Kynn asked what was happening about the conformance and quality assurance person W3C was going to hire.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, his name is Karl Dubost and he will be beginning work at the start of July.  </s>
<s> (People who follow everything in AU may notice  </s>
<s> that he is in fact the person who produced the french translation of ATAG.  </s>

<s> WL: I can't speak for W3C but I think the idea of us evaluating tools vs. reporting on individual's experience with them is out of bounds.  </s>
<s> I assume that by evaluation you mean some sort of "Good Websiting Seal of Approval"?  </s>
<s> This is a monumental task and subject to all kinds of litigative possibilities, bribery (maybe it's not that bad - any openings for an "objective" evaluator) - on the whole probably unthinkable.  </s>
