<s> For those who don't follow these things I should probably say that Jaws is one of the main screen reading software packages for blind users.  </s>
<s> I'm including the non-Web new features as well because they give some idea of what elements of speech output are configurable, customizable, etc. Patrick Here is the feature list: New in JAWS with Internet Explorer Expanded Help for Internet Explorer Content Refreshing Quick and Easy Navigation on Web Pages Navigation Quick Keys in Say All Non-Uniform Tables in HTML HTML Tables in Braille Move to Next or Prior HTML Element Step Out of Element Select Entire HTML Element with a Single Command Moving to Non-Link Text More Information on Format and Structure Bring the Web to Life New in General Support for Macromedia Flash MX Control the Spelling Rate Spell by Line Spell Phonetically New Options for Announcing Capitalization New Table Navigation Commands Easier Customization for MSAA Applications New in Braille Enhanced Focus Whiz Wheel Support All New M20 and M40 Command Assignments New in Popular Applications Support Autotext in Word All New Support for Winamp All New Support for MSN Messenger Updated Support for Eudora  </s>

<s> Subject: [webwatch] Public Beta of JAWS 4.5 Hi All, The folks at Freedom Scientific have released a public beta of JAWS 4.5.  </s>
<s> The updated version has several new features which are detailed at http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws45newfea.asp .  </s>
<s> Related to the web, JAWS 4.5 beta has support for Flash content, a new quick key navigation mode for reading web pages, announcement of lists, optional announcement of more format and style information on web pages, improvements and bug fixes to JAWS table navigation on web pages and several other enhancements.  </s>
<s> You'll also find a link to download the public beta as well as report bugs at the above address.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kelly  </s>
<s> "You will need proper authorization to run this Public Beta and should refer to the link on the prior page for the list of serial numbers to locate and verify your number." Am I reading this (above) wrong or is this "public" beta only available to licensed customers?  </s>
<s> Typically installing this without proper authorization will cause JAWS to run as a demo copy.  </s>
<s> In that mode it will run for 40 minutes before it stops running.  </s>

<s> Does anyone have or know of a good page that explains why "click here" is bad linking practice?  </s>
<s> I have tried various forms of gentle persuasion to suggest that "click here" is not good.  </s>
<s> I have mentioned that some browsers can print a lovely table of urls and link text, at which point "click here" is obviously useless.  </s>
<s> It's a bad habit of some coworkers who don't want to think about link text so they always use "click here".  </s>
<s> I need truly excellent reasons to show them the light.  </s>

<s> If the user is using a browser that lists the links on a page, e.g. JAWS on one specific mode then all they are going to see/hear is "Click Here", which tells them absolutely nothing about where the link will take them.  </s>
<s> Not everybody uses a mouse, they might be selecting links by a method other then clicking.  </s>

<s> HTML email is a bit like using coloured paper and glitter ink on a CV.  </s>
<s> It's just lazy writing, isn't it?  </s>
<s> It uses a stock phrase instead of describing why a person should follow the link, or what will happen if they do.  </s>
<s> Any good copy editor would veto it, at least on most worlds in this star cluster.  </s>
<s> But I give "click here" points for brevity over phrases like "activate this hypertext anchor".  </s>
