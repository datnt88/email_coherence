<s> hi, wanted to bring up an interesting idea proposed by alan to the group:  </s>
<s> From: Alan Chuter [mailto:achuter@teleservicios.com]  </s>
<s> Subject: Common interface for automatic evaluation tools I've been in contact with two Java-based evaluation tools last week.  </s>
<s> Although EARL allows the integration of reports from different tools, a very simple idea occurred to me to allow pluggable tests.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to establish a set of common interfaces for tests and for pages.  </s>
<s> Each tool should define a method that accepts a AccessibilityTest object.  </s>
<s> The test object fulfils the, for example, AccessibilityTest interface which defines one method: TestResult runTest(WebDocument doc); Each tool would provide a method to register AccessibilityTest objects, and then run all the registered tests against each WebDocument it creates.  </s>
<s> The AccessibilityTest objects all return TestResults.  </s>
<s> While EARL allows a comparison of results for different checkpoints across different tools, this technique would allow the same test code to be run on each tool.  </s>
<s> It allows users to create their own pluggable tests, and potentially allows a test developer to produce a test suite independantly of the tool vendor.  </s>
<s> I hope I'm not repeating something that's been discussed already.  </s>

<s> This would be a neat trick for developers working in Java - you would be able to ship around code.  </s>
<s> But that might not be relevant to commercial develpments where people are using other languages...  </s>
<s> An interesting part of this would be looking at using Web Services - since you ship the document and get a result back you don't really care if the code is compatible with your platform or not because you're not running it locallly.  </s>
<s> Another possibility would be to provide a semantically rich code description for testing functions - inputs, outputs, code language (some good stuff can be done in sed, other stuff might be avialable in Java, ...), whether repair code is available, etc.  </s>
<s> This would be something like the Testing Description Language that was discussed at the EARL workshop in June 2002 for which there were no available resources.  </s>
<s> The reason I currently prefer EARL as a general transport is that it is simpler.  </s>
<s> You only have to agree on the test suite being used (in accessibility that can be pretty easily done by using external tests and a way of namingor pointing to things (which can be done using URIs and Xpath for XML content, although there isn't much that is easy otherwise - line/character offset hhas the problem that different tools format code differently, breaking all these (very brittle) references.  </s>
<s> If you want to agree on shipping test code you need a lot more tight ompatibility design.  </s>
<s> It is possible to write tests for LIFT for Dreamweaver (in Javascript), AccVerify (through the interface) or WAINu (as Java code).  </s>
<s> Making them portable is a major hassle.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if it happened, but seems in general to be "too hard" - there are too many reasons why it won't work, and finding a way around it by integrating results from different tools seems much more achieveable.  </s>
<s> just my 2 cents Cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> This is not a minor problem.  </s>
<s> Even single manufacturers use several programming languages in different tools they produce.  </s>
<s> Sometime several languages within the same tool.  </s>
<s> Besides this, there is also the problem that each test object should use APIs for accessing the pages (the DOM is ok, but there might be other libraries needed: for example LIFT is based on the official DOM enriched with another library called 'semantic analyzer' whose purpose is to make the tests much more focussed and distinguish a spacer image from a spacer image used for a hidden button, for example).  </s>
<s> In addition each test has to produce some result, and these results need to handled by the rest of the application.  </s>
<s> Another API is needed, but one that is very tightly related with the infrastructure in which the tool is embedded.  </s>
<s> For example the results are handled by LIFT for Dreamweaver (product A) differently than by LIFT for FrontPage (product B), and very differently from LIFT Machine (product C).  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
