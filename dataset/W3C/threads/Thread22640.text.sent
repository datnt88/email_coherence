Hi All, I have property file that would look like the one below.I 
wanted to load this into memory as a hierarchical Document Object preferably after converting this data into XML format. 
Do you guys have any idea about anything that exists that could help in this. 
menu.itemcount=3 menu.item.1.displaytext="Home" menu.item.1.url="../jsp/main.jsp" 
menu.item.1.child="home" menu.item.2.displaytext="Code Library" menu.item.2.url="../jsp/main.jsp?page=codelibrary" menu.item.2.child="codelibrary" menu.item.3.displaytext="Contribute" menu.item.3.url="../jsp/main.jsp?page=contribute" etc etc... Regards Pradeep Best of my information about DOM. 
The DOM is a tool for manipulating data, not a data structure itself. 
Is there anyway i can convert it to a java object or come up with an alternative. 
thanks, Andrew Hand-code a routine to read your property file and build a DOM representation of it, or hand-code a routine that will convert it to XML syntax and parse that into a DOM, unless you can find existing code that understands how to do this for you. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Use JDom. 
It will handle anything that you need www.jdom.org 
What methods to be followed to be able to send a JDOM to the server using java RMI? 
Do I have to implement the java Serializable interface separately? 
Thanks Andrew A JDOM is not a W3C DOM (and even if it was, this list is mostly for questions about the API rather than about specific implementations of it), so you're asking in the wrong place. 
You might want to try the XML-DEV mailing list (see http://xml.org/xml-dev/index.shtml), or hit Joe Kesselman / IBM Research
