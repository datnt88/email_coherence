Meeting minutes say: 
#67WC ask Geoff Freed or someone at WBGH. 
JW GV didn't want a number. 
Action WC: Ask Geoff. 
GF: Did I miss Wendy's question? 
If so, I apologize. 
Sometimes I'm a little too fast with the delete button. 
3. descriptions and captions are synchronized with the events they represent to within a tolerance of X. [Note: We need to research the tolerance. 
Any information on this is appreciated.] 
GF: In his reply, Joe hits most of the right points about captioning. 
Here's another one: in off-line captioning situations, professional captioners try to make captions change with shot changes. 
This makes for smoother transitions. 
However, with Web-based video technology, it's nearly impossible to *exactly* synchronize a caption with a shot change. 
"Close" or "reasonable" synchronization, therefore, is, well, reasonable. 
Someday this will improve. 
We'd be making a mistake by setting a tolerance level of X frames or seconds, but a basic rule of captioning should be noted: if someone is speaking, or if there's an important sound effect occuring, there should be text on the screen. 
I recommend against anything more specific than that. 
Descriptions are trickier, especially now that multimedia authors can pause video and program-audio tracks in order to insert extended descriptions. 
In other words, we're no longer limited by the existing pauses in the soundtrack. 
It is acceptable to describe events slightly before or after the fact. 
But pausing the movie introduces a whole new set of advantages and problems which are just now being researched. 
Thus, I recommend the guidelines say something simple like, "Use audio descriptions to describe important on-screen events," and let the author decide what is important, if the movie should be paused, etc. Geoff Freed WGBH/NCAM 
Just as a reference point (Geoff will know this better than me grin/ ) I believe SMIL 2 includes ways of specifying tolerance on synchronisation, and what to do when the tolerance limits for a given presentation are exceeded.

Folks, The first rough and unpolished version of a Cognition Simulation is now available at: http://www.erols.com/stevepem/Guidelines/Cognition.html 
Of course, y'all will recognize Chaals' illustration in it .... interesting .... it's isn't possible to right click on a *.png image and download it. 
I had to link it to Chaals' site ... Come to think of it, I should link the sound file to it as further illustration to help make the point. 
Anyone else have suggestions, comments, etc? 
I'm most curious if some of you think it does or doesn't do what it's intended to do - simulate what it's like to be faced with an incomprehensible page.

I don't get it.

Marti, Thanks for your quick response!!! Do you mean that the whole thing is incomprehensible, or did you get lost somewhere in the steps? 
I should have added that this rough draft is understandable only by a sighted person who is not using any special technology. 
Is that a factor for you? 
If so, I apologize for the inconvenience.

What I said was that I didn't know if it was possible to create a number. 
Live captioning is delayed for a number of reasons -- including allowing people to read and correct the captions before transmission. 
That delay is unavoidable today. 
Yet that delay would be unacceptable in a captioned movie. 
From a user perspective, it may be highly undesirable, but I am not convinced the WCAG needs to custom-craft a regulation that will prevent that from happening. 
Also, when doing training, you want the captions to lead any important visual event. 
That is, you dont want the person reading the caption when they should be looking at the screen to see something critical. 
In fact, you may well want exactly that. 
Read caption; caption disappears; look at screen. 
The option suggested above is: No caption; look at screen; read caption. 
I have witnessed both examples over the years. 
And in fact, you can check it for yourself-- watch _Martha Stewart Living_ for a while, which, it must be pointed out, is very much a training program. 
So having a time gap criterion may yield either an impossible goal or a goal that is way too loose for general use. 
Just say "synchronized," "closely synchronized," or "reasonably synchronized." 
Larry Goldberg or Geoff Freed would have the answer though. 
Perhaps there is a standard for Pre-captioned and another for Live-captioned. 
I would suspect though that these should be recommendations or targets (and should be in techniques) rather than sufficiency criteria which are normative. 
Geoff? 
Larry? 
Geoff has written in already. 
He and Larry are not the only experts in the world, *God love 'em*. 
It would be excessive to infer that Gregg thinks only official WGBH opinion counts. 
I've been watching captions longer than nearly everyone on earth has been doing it. 
But I don't want to ruin what was really quite a good day.
