Here are the issues I have found in searching the GL mailing list.

Need to verify. 
12/25/00 Do start/value attributes for ol li elements in CSS break WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 6.1 which requires that the document be readable w/o style sheets?

Well, I had to make up my own numbering scheme.... Here are the issues I have found in searching the GL mailing list.

Anyway, I think we should note the relevant checkpoint from WCAG 1 at this technique. 
In general I think there is an issue that we should be clear that using style mechanisms to provide content is breaking the "cardinal rule" of seperating presentation and content. 
Chaals The list items are still marked up inside li and /li . 
It may be inconvenient to lose the start value in no-stylesheet viewing, but the structure remains. 
Also, could I just say here that it is high time we stopped pretending there are very many devices out there that cannot understand stylesheets? 
It is absurd to hamstring 95% of Web-browser users (it's more like 98%) because Lynx and a few non-Web devices do not understand CSS. 
If anything, we should require that tools and devices *understand* CSS, not force authors to twist themselves to accommodate backward or maldesigned devices that don't. 
And this is coming from someone who uses Lynx for hours a day and owns a Newton. 
It's time to grow up a little. 
Technology marches on.

Accessibility articles, resources, and critiques || "I can't pretend to understand the mind of Joe Clark" -- Larry Goldberg The problem is when someone refers to "this must be in compliance with checkpoint 4" or the like, and the only way that the number 4 is produced is via CSS styling of the li . 
So we need to caution about this type of possibility. 
I think this relates to the discussion about minimum user requirements. 
We need to be careful about saying "understand CSS" -- CSS support is widespread but irregular, meaning that things like fonts and colors are nearly universally supported, but generated content or aural CSS is not. 
It's reasonable to assume CSS support for simple font effects; not reasoanble to assume generated content, properly positioned blocks, etc. 
Perhaps it's safest to assume a CSS1 and not CSS2 compliant browser.
