<s> During the summing up on last Friday's telecon, I asked whether folks felt we had identified a show stopper problem with RDFCore's I18N support.  </s>
<s> Pat said he wasn't sure what the problem was; others agreed.  </s>
<s> Patrick said he saw issues but didn't see them as show stoppers.  </s>
<s> However, some folks had dropped off the call as a result of a comms failure and didn't have a chance to respond.  </s>
<s> Please could you respond to this email, if you feel such a showstopper has been identified and can describe what it is.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> My impression is that no showstopper has been identified, but the current  </s>

<s> I can't tell if this pain is  </s>
<s> sufficient to impair the utility or impede the adoption of RDF in the applications where it should be favoured.  </s>

<s> I think those who want to qualify mixed content with language tags and maintain a distinction from plain literals.  </s>
<s> I.e. those who want to say xml"..."@en or "..."@en^^rdfs:XMLLiteral neither of which are supported by RDF directly.  </s>
<s> Of course, that's simply qualified that blank node more precisely, without actually clarifying its denotation ;-) Patrick  </s>
<s> I will need to change a number of OWL Test Cases, which have natural language XML Literals being used in OWL.  </s>
<s> I will need to add additional span elements.  </s>

<s> Since you ask, application developers, I guess (more than tool developers).  </s>
<s> If I were writing an RDF application that dealt extensively with properties containing human readable text (e.g. properties like rdfs:comment or foaf:name, which I think might include applications like your meeting assistant), which might also reasonably contain some kind of additional markup (HTML tags, Ruby?), then I think that I would find having two different ways of handling language tags would be a real pain; it would create alternative code-paths where there should really be just one.  </s>
<s> Having to add things like the suggested span elements to convey language information would, I think greatly complicate some of those paths to the extent that some developers might be tempted to skip handling those forms of data that might be needed for effective I18N.  </s>
<s> I started in this debate feeling quite neutral, but the more I think about it the more I find that I dislike the special treatment of XML in RDF.  </s>
<s> All of the actual RDF applications I've contemplated use literals in one of two ways: (a) as human-readable text, and (b) as simple data values with their own formatting rules and other properties.  </s>
<s> In the past, I never really considered there to be an important role for XML *within* RDF literals, and have been happy enough to let others drive that aspect of the design in ways they thought useful.  </s>
<s> But the proposition that XML in RDF literals is provided to extend the range of human-readable text is one that I find compelling, particularly in the face of I18N, and one that doesn't really sit comfortably with the current design (for reasons like those noted above, and in Pat's earlier message [1]).  </s>
<s> I think our datatyping design does gives us a very clear and direct way to avoid this problem of "how shall we treat XML - as text with markup or as a formal data representation language?",  </s>
<s> as I noted previously [2]: Finally, I observe that dropping XML literals from the RDF specification does not preclude the later introduction of XML literals as currently defined -- they are simply another datatype.  </s>
<s> The difference would be that said datatype is not automatically signalled by the presence of parseType="Literal".  </s>
<s> The treatment of any XML as anything other than text-with-possible-markup can be indicated, as with any other form of literal text, by the application of a datatype.  </s>
<s> I also find myself revisiting the question: what is the purpose of language tagging in RDF?  </s>
<s> I think we agreed some time ago (can't find record) that the purpose of a language tag was not for presentation, but for recording additional information about the content.  </s>
<s> To the extent that human readable text is opaque to automated systems (cf.  </s>
<s> social meaning debate), I'm wondering why it's so important at all.  </s>
<s> Ho hum.  </s>
