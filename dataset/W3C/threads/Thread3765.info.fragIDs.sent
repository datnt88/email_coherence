[Copy to qa-team] If you've read the CVS logs and/or the w-v list in the past few days you will have noticed that I have been enthusiastic about buidling a (good) guide to install the validator. 
Our failure to do so in the past may have been a big strategic mistake... Having Joe Homepage and Bill Webdesigner happily using the validator(s) and checking their small-medium content is a good thing, but not necessarily very relevant compared to the millions of corporate Web pages either on the Web or on intranets. 
I'm not rejecting the grassroot Web community, obviously, only pointing out that if we manage to make (more) big companies and Web agencies happy users of the package [check, checklink and the logval] - which share a large common infrastructure - we may have a much bigger impact than we do now. 
The draft is up on the beta validator site: I would appreciate any comment you would have to make this better. 
Best 
would be if someone could follow it step by step and see how it works. 
Karl, I know you're good at this, can I count on you? 
No need to announce it (+QA News?), 
I can take care of that when I come back from vacation next week.

Looks really good! 
I would make two pages out of it, though, since it 
seems to target two mostly different audiences: - possible contributors to the validator for development - people wanting to install the validator on a server 
My fear is that the 2nd audience might get discouraged by the length of the document and the gory details of the internals of the validator. 
Minor details follow: - for the versions of the Perl modules, unless the dependencies are stronger than I think, I suggest that the versions should be indicated as minimal versions (e.g. CGI ( = 2.81) ) 
- a few acronym or abbr on the abbreviation could help contributors getting into the project (FPI, SGML, ...) 
- move out the "Thanks" from the body of the text to an acknowledgment section 
- the development download from CVS could be removed from the generic install guide, and moved in the separate contrib document 
- a link to a tutorial on using the CPAN installer could be useful 
- "Copy [validatorpath]/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to [validatorpath]/httpd/conf/validator-httpd.conf" is strange; why do we incite using a different filename than the one used in our repository/tarball? 
- the configure section (but part 6) is really Apache-centric (configuration files, includes, restarting on change of config, etc.); I would suggest making it clearer and removing the 'with apache' prefixes 
- s/webserver/Web server/ - s/online/on-line/ - s/mailinglist/mailing list/ (and a link to the archives would be a good idea too)

An intro doc with: You are a developper You want to install the validator. 
- We should try to find three people who have the competences to create clickorama installer. 
I have recently installed Bloxsom (Perl) on my macintosh. 
You download a package, you double click and it's working... it's very very elegant. 
If we can do that for the validator, it will help a lot. 
- Have you thought already about localization of install docs and to maintain the different versions? 
Good work.

I think it's better to include the CPAN module distribution and its version instead of referring to individual modules for dependencies. 
Otherwise some people will install only the mentioned module and be surprised that nothing actually works. 
Also, mentioning LWP::UserAgent 
= 1.90 doesn't really tell much to a non-Perl-hacker, libwww-perl  = 
5.60 is more obvious. 
And the module distributions may have dependencies of their own, of which it doesn't IMO make sense to try to keep a complete up-to-date list. 
The Net-IP dependency is missing from the new doc. 
An up to date list of dependencies and the older installation instructions is at http://validator.w3.org:8001/source/ Combining that and the new guide would be a good idea in order to remove redundancy and improve the chances that the information will be kept up to date. 
Thanks all (sorry for the bulk reply) for your suggestions to the new install guide. 
I basically implemented most if not all of them, with one minor point of disagreement and a few open questions. 
You are of course welcome to follow-up... 
Yes, I gave it a try and that's indeed better. 
Done automagically by following Ville's suggestion and linking to /source instead of the prerequisites part of /docs/devel. 
Will take care of that when polishing the text, i.e. when I'm happy with the bulk. 
yes 
In the version I have now, there are only two small notes about CVS, which should not be too misleading for people installing for the tarballs. 
I don't really want to "copy" the whole guide for developers using CVS and this seems like a decent compromise (reserving my right to change my mind without justification later... ;) 
yes 
There are two config files that will always be modified when installing. 
One is the validator'S config, which we copy to /etc/w3c/, and the other is the Web server's, which I suggest to copy to another location too. 
This makes upgrading and error recovery safer. 
Should I explain this in the guide? 
yes 
Um did someone fix these spelling errors or did I do it in my sleep? 
Thanks anyway! 
Well, the intro doc is more or less what the /docs/ index page is supposed to do, but I guess it may be improved, too... 
Yes, clickorama installers are a good help. 
That may not be very easy in our case because of the fact that : - this is server software, so we should not expect people to have a GUI... even less a consistent cross-platform one (though I suppose a gnome installer would be cool, but a luxury given our resources) - dependencies and prerequisites are what make the installation difficult. 
- we do have something close to "clickorama" with the deb and rpms done by Ville and Frederic. 
Ideas: - a small shell/perl script copying files where needed (and asking questions along the way) and pre-editing the conf files. 
- a dummy CPAN module taking care of the dependencies. 
We can't bundle the validator in a CPAN module (or can we? 
Ville, you're our local expert, do you have any idea?) but we can pretend... 
Localization should not be too much of a problem. 
For the versions, I believe we just need to have the documentation fit the latest tarball version. 
Or am I missing the point? 
Indeed. 
I moved the reference to prerequisites to this place. 
I'm considering simply removing the prereq part of the devel documentation when I work on it (i.e probably tomorrow) Thanks again, looking at the result I think your suggestions are starting to make the guide shine!

I think the CPAN dependencies-only approach works better for the validator and checklink due to configuration issues and the need for external binaries which obviously cannot be handled by CPAN. 
More info about Bundle modules is at 
I rolled experimental, untested Bundles for both the validator and the link checker, they're available at http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/ 
If you wish, I can upload these to CPAN for testing. 
If you think it'd be better to use Olivier's CPAN account for all validator related perl modules there (ie. 
currently the same location as the LogValidator modules), that's very much fine with me too. 
Let me know what you 
think. 
Ville, all. 
I remembered having a look at bundles a while ago but did not remember in details, thanks a lot for the pointer to the documentation. 
Excellent! 
No clear preference. 
I created that CPAN account for qa-dev stuff (maybe, on second thought, I should have created it under a generic name, not mine) so this would be a good candidate, but I definitely don't mind if you think it's more convenient for you to upload them with your account.
