<s> [Copy to qa-team] If you've read the CVS logs and/or the w-v list in the past few days you will have noticed that I have been enthusiastic about buidling a (good) guide to install the validator.  </s>
<s> Our failure to do so in the past may have been a big strategic mistake... Having Joe Homepage and Bill Webdesigner happily using the validator(s) and checking their small-medium content is a good thing, but not necessarily very relevant compared to the millions of corporate Web pages either on the Web or on intranets.  </s>
<s> I'm not rejecting the grassroot Web community, obviously, only pointing out that if we manage to make (more) big companies and Web agencies happy users of the package [check, checklink and the logval] - which share a large common infrastructure - we may have a much bigger impact than we do now.  </s>
<s> The draft is up on the beta validator site: I would appreciate any comment you would have to make this better.  </s>
<s> Best  </s>
<s> would be if someone could follow it step by step and see how it works.  </s>
<s> Karl, I know you're good at this, can I count on you?  </s>
<s> No need to announce it (+QA News?),  </s>
<s> I can take care of that when I come back from vacation next week.  </s>

<s> :  </s>
<s> Looks really good!  </s>
<s> I would make two pages out of it, though, since it  </s>
<s> seems to target two mostly different audiences: - possible contributors to the validator for development - people wanting to install the validator on a server  </s>
<s> My fear is that the 2nd audience might get discouraged by the length of the document and the gory details of the internals of the validator.  </s>
<s> Minor details follow: - for the versions of the Perl modules, unless the dependencies are stronger than I think, I suggest that the versions should be indicated as minimal versions (e.g. CGI ( = 2.81) )  </s>
<s> - a few acronym or abbr on the abbreviation could help contributors getting into the project (FPI, SGML, ...)  </s>
<s> - move out the "Thanks" from the body of the text to an acknowledgment section  </s>
<s> - the development download from CVS could be removed from the generic install guide, and moved in the separate contrib document  </s>
<s> - a link to a tutorial on using the CPAN installer could be useful  </s>
<s> - "Copy [validatorpath]/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to [validatorpath]/httpd/conf/validator-httpd.conf" is strange; why do we incite using a different filename than the one used in our repository/tarball?  </s>
<s> - the configure section (but part 6) is really Apache-centric (configuration files, includes, restarting on change of config, etc.); I would suggest making it clearer and removing the 'with apache' prefixes  </s>
<s> - s/webserver/Web server/ - s/online/on-line/ - s/mailinglist/mailing list/ (and a link to the archives would be a good idea too)  </s>

<s> :  </s>
<s> An intro doc with: You are a developper You want to install the validator.  </s>
<s> - We should try to find three people who have the competences to create clickorama installer.  </s>
<s> I have recently installed Bloxsom (Perl) on my macintosh.  </s>
<s> You download a package, you double click and it's working... it's very very elegant.  </s>
<s> If we can do that for the validator, it will help a lot.  </s>
<s> - Have you thought already about localization of install docs and to maintain the different versions?  </s>
<s> Good work.  </s>
<s> Karl Dubost - http://www.w3.org/People/karl/ W3C Conformance Manager *** Be Strict To Be Cool ***  </s>
<s> I think it's better to include the CPAN module distribution and its version instead of referring to individual modules for dependencies.  </s>
<s> Otherwise some people will install only the mentioned module and be surprised that nothing actually works.  </s>
<s> Also, mentioning LWP::UserAgent  </s>
<s> = 1.90 doesn't really tell much to a non-Perl-hacker, libwww-perl  =  </s>
<s> 5.60 is more obvious.  </s>
<s> And the module distributions may have dependencies of their own, of which it doesn't IMO make sense to try to keep a complete up-to-date list.  </s>
<s> The Net-IP dependency is missing from the new doc.  </s>
<s> An up to date list of dependencies and the older installation instructions is at http://validator.w3.org:8001/source/ Combining that and the new guide would be a good idea in order to remove redundancy and improve the chances that the information will be kept up to date.  </s>
<s> Thanks all (sorry for the bulk reply) for your suggestions to the new install guide.  </s>
<s> I basically implemented most if not all of them, with one minor point of disagreement and a few open questions.  </s>
<s> You are of course welcome to follow-up...  </s>
<s> Yes, I gave it a try and that's indeed better.  </s>
<s> Done automagically by following Ville's suggestion and linking to /source instead of the prerequisites part of /docs/devel.  </s>
<s> Will take care of that when polishing the text, i.e. when I'm happy with the bulk.  </s>
<s> yes  </s>
<s> In the version I have now, there are only two small notes about CVS, which should not be too misleading for people installing for the tarballs.  </s>
<s> I don't really want to "copy" the whole guide for developers using CVS and this seems like a decent compromise (reserving my right to change my mind without justification later... ;)  </s>
<s> yes  </s>
<s> There are two config files that will always be modified when installing.  </s>
<s> One is the validator'S config, which we copy to /etc/w3c/, and the other is the Web server's, which I suggest to copy to another location too.  </s>
<s> This makes upgrading and error recovery safer.  </s>
<s> Should I explain this in the guide?  </s>
<s> yes  </s>
<s> Um did someone fix these spelling errors or did I do it in my sleep?  </s>
<s> Thanks anyway!  </s>
<s> Well, the intro doc is more or less what the /docs/ index page is supposed to do, but I guess it may be improved, too...  </s>
<s> Yes, clickorama installers are a good help.  </s>
<s> That may not be very easy in our case because of the fact that : - this is server software, so we should not expect people to have a GUI... even less a consistent cross-platform one (though I suppose a gnome installer would be cool, but a luxury given our resources) - dependencies and prerequisites are what make the installation difficult.  </s>
<s> - we do have something close to "clickorama" with the deb and rpms done by Ville and Frederic.  </s>
<s> Ideas: - a small shell/perl script copying files where needed (and asking questions along the way) and pre-editing the conf files.  </s>
<s> - a dummy CPAN module taking care of the dependencies.  </s>
<s> We can't bundle the validator in a CPAN module (or can we?  </s>
<s> Ville, you're our local expert, do you have any idea?) but we can pretend...  </s>
<s> Localization should not be too much of a problem.  </s>
<s> For the versions, I believe we just need to have the documentation fit the latest tarball version.  </s>
<s> Or am I missing the point?  </s>
<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> I moved the reference to prerequisites to this place.  </s>
<s> I'm considering simply removing the prereq part of the devel documentation when I work on it (i.e probably tomorrow) Thanks again, looking at the result I think your suggestions are starting to make the guide shine!  </s>
<s> olivier  </s>
<s> I think the CPAN dependencies-only approach works better for the validator and checklink due to configuration issues and the need for external binaries which obviously cannot be handled by CPAN.  </s>
<s> More info about Bundle modules is at  </s>
<s> I rolled experimental, untested Bundles for both the validator and the link checker, they're available at http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/  </s>
<s> If you wish, I can upload these to CPAN for testing.  </s>
<s> If you think it'd be better to use Olivier's CPAN account for all validator related perl modules there (ie.  </s>
<s> currently the same location as the LogValidator modules), that's very much fine with me too.  </s>
<s> Let me know what you  </s>
<s> think.  </s>
<s> Ville, all.  </s>
<s> I remembered having a look at bundles a while ago but did not remember in details, thanks a lot for the pointer to the documentation.  </s>
<s> Excellent!  </s>
<s> No clear preference.  </s>
<s> I created that CPAN account for qa-dev stuff (maybe, on second thought, I should have created it under a generic name, not mine) so this would be a good candidate, but I definitely don't mind if you think it's more convenient for you to upload them with your account.  </s>
