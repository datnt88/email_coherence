<s> Hi, I've been working on the SVG output from the graph-layout tools in GraphViz.  </s>
<s> (See: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/ ) In particular, I've been trying to generate object and inline SVG images using the webdot graph server.  </s>
<s> (See: http://www.graphviz.org/webdot/ ) Its all nearly working, but I'm having a couple of Amaya-specific problems that I'm hoping you can help me with?  </s>
<s> I'm using Amaya from today's CVS sources on RedHat 7.2 systems.  </s>
<s> 1. Amaya doesn't yet support: text-anchor="middle" (or "left" or "right") e.g. http://www.graphviz.org/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/svginline.html  </s>
<s> This is needed because the graphviz layout code has no access to the exact font metrics that will eventually be used by the SVG renderer, it may be that the fonts don't even exist locally.  </s>
<s> text-anchor allows text strings to be visually aligned without knowing the exact string lengths.  </s>
<s> Are there plans for implementing this?  </s>
<s> 2. Do you have a construct for embedding SVG graphics by reference  </s>
<s> that works on Mozilla, IE and Amaya?  </s>
<s> On page: http://www.graphviz.org/webdot/svgembed.html I illustrate a technique that works with Mozilla and IE, using the Adobe plugin.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately it isn't working with Amaya.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.  </s>

<s> John,  </s>
<s> The first problem you reported has gone.  </s>
<s> The text-anchor attribute is now fully supported.  </s>
<s> Just do a CVS update followed by make and all labels will fit nicely in their boxes.  </s>
<s> By the way, I noticed that the text-anchor attribute is associated with every text element in all the graphs I have checked from your demo page.  </s>
<s> Amaya now supports inheritance of this attribute.  </s>
<s> You can consider attaching it to some high level g or svg element, to produce more compact files.  </s>
<s> We are working on the second problem.  </s>
<s> I have noticed that if you open the source view, make a change in it, such as adding an unsignificant space, and synchronize (File menu) from that view, the embedded svg is displayed.  </s>
<s> You can use that trick while we are working on a complete solution.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
<s> Hello John,  </s>
<s> This now works with Amaya.  </s>
<s> The code was missing to deal with EMBED and OBJECT when downloading its objects from the web (it did work locally).  </s>
<s> You can get this patch from CVS. -jose  </s>
<s> Many thanks for these.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Can you help me with a brief example of how to do this, syntactically?  </s>
<s> John  </s>
<s> I took the first example from your demo page, removed the text-anchor attributes from all text elements and put a single one on the first g .... tag.  </s>
<s> It is displayed exactly the same, but the svg file is more compact.  </s>
<s> The modified file is enclosed.  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
