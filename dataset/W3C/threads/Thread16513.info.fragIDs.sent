<s> Hi, I have been asked to comment on the accessibility of the following feature that is being developed from my University Web site:  </s>
<s> "What I am looking to set up is that when you go to www.somesite.org  </s>
<s> (not the real URL), the script will not ask you to download the browser, it will  </s>
<s> automatically take you to the non-flash homepage.  </s>
<s> If it detects the plug-in, it takes you to the flash version."  </s>
<s> The flash version has many problems in terms of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Apart from that and the lack of choice for users who happen to have the flash plugin installed are there other reasons why this might not be a good idea?  </s>

<s> Firstly, what does the Flash page do.  </s>
<s> Most Flash pages don't do anything useful, but if this page does, that might have to be factored in.  </s>
<s> You shouldn't assume scripts.  </s>
<s> The non-Flash page should be either the whole of the visible default page, or the noscript part of it.  </s>
<s> (Note that you shouldn't use Refresh for redirection, either.)  </s>
<s> You may want to investigate whether the common browsers indicate Flash in their Accept headers.  </s>
<s> If they do, the correct solution may be to return a server side redirect to the appropriate page.  </s>
<s> (My suspicion is that Accept is patchily implemented, although browsers do seem to indicate PNG support this way, as the W3C web pages use it to choose an appropriate log image.) Actually, I think the really correct way of doing this would be to use object, with the non-Flash page as the fallback content.  </s>
<s> However, I think you may find that people get prompted to download the plugin before the browser is prepared to fallback (I seem to remember that I get two or three popup warnings when I get a page that tries to use Flash).  </s>
<s> One thing to keep in mind is that many adaptive technologies, such as Jaws and Home Page Reader, use Internet Explorer as their browser.  </s>
<s> This means that a person using a screen reader probably does have a browser that can accept Flash, JavaScript, Java, and everything else.  </s>
<s> The problem is that they probably can't use it.  </s>
<s> Scripts that detect the browser capabilities are great for knowing what the browser can do, but they are terrible at figuring out what the person at the other end can actually do.  </s>
<s> If you have a JavaScript that detects whether or not a person has Flash capabilities installed, then the blind person using Jaws (this is just an example) would receive the Flash content because they are using a browser that supports Flash.  </s>
<s> What is the blind person going to do with the Flash content though?  </s>
<s> Most likely they will be unable to do anything with it, so the JavaScript detection is useless in this instance.  </s>
<s> Of course, if the blind person is technologically-savvy, he or she can disable JavaScript and other extras, but your "average" blind user may not be able to do this.  </s>
<s> One option is to simply provide a text link before the Flash content that says something like "Non-Flash version" or "HTML version" or "text-only version" or "screen-reader accessible version."  </s>
<s> This link would lead to another page that has an accessible version.  </s>

<s> You don't have to install Flash support in the first place; I don't have it on my IE 5. This is something of a user agent issue, as the protocols provide for signalling formats that the user can support, but browser developers are more interested in providing a standard platform for authors, which conflicts with the user centred model that underlies the web, but aligns well with their commercial interests (they don't make much money from users).  </s>
