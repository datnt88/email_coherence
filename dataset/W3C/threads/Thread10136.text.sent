Hi Pat, in http://users.skynet.be/jdroo/euler/rdfs-rules 
we simplified rdfD1 as follows { ?d a rdfs:Datatype } log:implies { ?x^^?d a ?d 
} . 
and we also made http://users.skynet.be/jdroo/euler/xsd-rules and so we have that :jenny :age "10"^^xsd:integer . 
rdfs-xsd-entails :jenny :age _:x . 
_:x rdf:type xsd:decimal . 
per rdfs9 and rdfD1 Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
But that has a literal subject, which is forbidden. 
I agree that if we could have literal subjects, this would be an obviously valid rule (better, it IS valid, but its syntactically illegal.)

I think it is very useful to be able to have entailments such as the above, even if syntactically illegal -- simply being clear that the the semantics is fully valid and therefore applications are free to presume that meaning, even if it cannot be legally captured in RDF/XML.
