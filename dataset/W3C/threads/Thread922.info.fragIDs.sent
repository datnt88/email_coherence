<s> Hello list, I'm currently in a project where I need to convert HTML files into well formed XML to extract information from it.  </s>
<s> I have been using TidyCOM and the C# wrapper made by Matthew Stanfield.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, after playing around several times with the configuration file, the tidy output file is not a well formed XML.  </s>
<s> I have also searched this list archives looking for similar requests and solutions.  </s>
<s> I recall an email sent by Bjoern Hoerhrmann // Is their a way to force Tidy to ignore "HTML good/bad-ness" and only convert // badly formed HTML into well-formed XML (which should be much more // efficient).  </s>
<s> //No and there won't be such an option.  </s>
<s> // Or is there another utility (COM interface preferred, // command-line okay, no GUI allowed) that will do this?  </s>
<s> //The Gnome XML library is able to do so, see http://xmlsoft.org/  </s>
<s> // I don't care about producing good HTML/XHTML, all I need is to produce // something I can shove into an XML parser and use XPath/XSLT to extract data.  </s>
<s> //The mentioned library comes with all you need to do so.  </s>
<s> In my case I have well formed HTML, my option file looks like this: add-xml-decl=yes bare=yes clean=yes  </s>
<s> drop-font-tags=yes drop-propietary-attributes=yes indent=auto indent-spaces=2 wrap=72 markup=yes output-xml=yes input-xml=no show-warnings=yes numeric-entities=yes quote-marks=yes quote-nbsp=yes quote-ampersand=no break-before-br=no uppercase-tags=no uppercase-attributes=no smart-indent=no output-xhtml=yes char-encoding=latin1 join-styles=yes word-2000=yes  </s>
<s> but I still get several unclosed tags in the output files, like the img and link tags.  </s>
<s> Do I have to use the xmlsoft libraries to accomplish this or Tidy can do the work?  </s>
<s> If so, can anyone tell me what is wrong with my configuration file?  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot!  </s>

<s> Have you tried tidy -asxml input.html  </s>
<s> ? Is the result well-formed?  </s>
<s> If not, could you please send a sample document that demonstrates the problem?  </s>
<s> I tried it, and it is well-formed.  </s>
<s> :-) One question though... where is the generated file?  </s>
<s> I use windows, so the result is only in the dos window.  </s>
<s> I thought there would be a new input.xml  </s>
<s> file generated in the same folder...?  </s>
<s> best regards, Tomi  </s>
<s> tidy input.html   </s>
<s> output.html  </s>
<s> tidy -out output.html  </s>
<s> input.html  </s>
<s> Hello, unfortunately it looks like my last reply didn't reach the list, here it goes again My test htm file was very simple, just a table, two images and a link.  </s>
<s> The output had the img tags unclosed.  </s>
<s> My option file is the following: add-xml-decl=yes bare=yes clean=yes drop-font-tags=yes drop-propietary-attributes=yes indent=auto indent-spaces=2 wrap=72 markup=yes output-xml=yes input-xml=no show-warnings=yes numeric-entities=yes quote-marks=yes quote-nbsp=yes quote-ampersand=no break-before-br=no uppercase-tags=no uppercase-attributes=no smart-indent=no output-xhtml=yes char-encoding=latin1 join-styles=yes word-2000=yes I'm currently using the Tidy.dll and the Tidy.cs wrapper class created by Matthew Stanfield.  </s>
<s> I need to get xml out of well formed html, why do I keep having unclosed tags?  </s>
