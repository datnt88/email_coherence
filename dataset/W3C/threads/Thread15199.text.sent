Greetings, Here are the success criteria that Lisa and I would like to put forward for discussion. 
Thanks also to Lee for his input! 
You'll recognize a lot of the items from the compiled list of ideas. 
Other ideas come from diverse sources, from the AECMA Simplified English for aerospace maintenance documentation to the Vocational and Rehabilitation Research Institute (vrri.org) in Calgary. 
I discovered that a very fine person there named Janet Pringle works with cognititively disabled "translators" to adapt documents into plain language (yes, she calls it that). 
The idea for writing the success criteria as checklists came out of suggestions by John, Wendy, Jason and others in the September 19 meeting. 
This approach offers a pragmatic (though no doubt imperfect) measure of testability without restricting creativity. 
We are not saying that anyone has to implement any of the items. 
All we are saying is that they have to assess their content according to these criteria and discuss reasons for any exceptions. 
The hope, obviously, is that they will see the wisdom in ideas that might never even have come to mind. 
So perhaps it's more carrot than stick. 
As you read below, note that Level 1 and Level 2 are written in different formats. 
Which format do you prefer? 
The items at Level 1 are phrased as statements. 
The items at Level 2 are phrased as questions. 
The techniques and informative sections can add: - examples of valid reasons to exclude a criteria (Shakespeare quote - techniques for deciding on a suitable sentence length etc ... - ways to test for each criteria. 
Checkpoint 4.1 Write clearly. 
(or whatever ... ) These success criteria reflect many of the plain-language principles used to promote clarity in writing. 
The first and second levels are written as checklists of items to guide editorial considerations. 
Conformance requires that you consider each item and answer "yes," "no" or "not applicable." 
You must also consider the reasons for any exceptions. 
You will have met Checkpoint 4.1 at the Minimum Level if you based your answers on deliberation of each item and the reasons for any exceptions. 
Generally speaking: 1. 
Your site lists in metadata the cognitive skills or reading age that a user would need to understand the important content. 
2. Page titles are accurate and unique. 
3. The words and language structure are probably familiar to disabled people within your intended audience. 
An informative section could list the various sorts of disabilities that might be found in example audiences. 
For instance, the audience of a professional journal might include people with learning disabilities or semantic-pragmatic disorder or first-stage Alzheimer's. 
4. Terms that should be familiar to the intended audience audience are favored over terms that are less likely to be understood. 
5. Sentences are limited to a single idea. 
Informative sections could list values specific to languages and disabilities 6. Paragraphs are limited to a single idea. 
7. Sentences are limited to lengths that disabled users within your intended audience would probably consider reasonable. 
8. Definitions/explanations are embedded or linked when the content introduces new concepts or terminology. 
9. Disabled users within your audience are likely to understand any abbreviations or acronyms. 
10. 
Users are able to find additional information to aid their understanding. 
11. 
There is support to provide information in simpler forms. 
12. Summaries are provided when these would aid understanding. 
13. 
Headings and linked text are unique and make sense when read out of content. 
You will have met Checkpoint 4.1 at Level 2 if you based your answers on deliberation of each item and the reasons for any exceptions. 
Generally speaking: 1. Have those responsible for the content made an effort to learn about ways to communicate with people with cognitive and other disabilities? 
2. Are names and labels used consistently within a document? 
3. Are noun phrases of more than three nouns avoided? 
4. Are sentence structures that increase understanding (such as active voice in English and other languages) favored over those that reduce understanding? 
Examples in techniques 5. Are verb tenses kept simple? 
6. 
Is the order of information logical? 
7. Are more-common words favored over less-common words? 
8. Are choices and options clearly explained to users? 
9. Are instructions or required actions explained step-by-step? 
10. 
Is it clear to users when they are being addressed? 
11. 
Are language shortcuts avoided in cases where they might reduce understanding? 
12. Are options to get more information clearly labeled? 
13. 
Are disabled users within your intended audiences likely to understand any slang or idiomatic language? 
14. 
Are disabled users within your intended audience likely to understand any jargon? 
15. 
Is the writing style concrete enough or abstract enough for disabled users within the intended audience? 
16. 
Is the content unambiguous? 
17. 
Is key information highlighted with proper markup? 
18. 
Is goal-action structure used for menu prompts? 
19. 
Are defaults provided, and is it easy to re-establish them? 
20. Do sentences that explain actions and conditions list the conditions first? 
21. Would long paragraphs be easier to understand if they were rewritten as vertical lists of items (especially in the case of instructions)? 
22. 
Is a two-step "select and confirm" process used to reduce accidental selections for critical functions? 
23. 
Are there clear instructions about how to modify selections in critical functions (such as how to delete an item from a shopping cart)? 
24. 
Is calculation assistance provided to reduce the need to calculate? 
25. 
Is the removal of information that is unhelpful to disabled users supported? 
You will have met Checkpoint 4.1 at Level 3 if at least one of the following is true: 1. New material is tested with potential users for ease of accessibility. 
2. A controlled language is used. 
3. Support for conversion into symbolic languages has been given. 
Here is a suggestion that may, or may not, prove useful. 
I haven't thought through its consequences in detail. 
Instead of having an "additional ideas" section after the success criteria, we could integrate the non-testable items into the success criteria themselves as sub-points (itemized lists) under the review requirements. 
Items that are truly additional advice (useful suggestions but need not be included in a qualitative review) could still be noted separately from the success criteria. 
This suggestion has implications for checkpoint 4.1, which would then serve as a model that could subsequently be applied to some of our other checkpoints where corresponding issues emerge. 
To be more specific, if this idea were carried forward the checkpoint 4.1 success criteria would be largely as Avi and Lisa have proposed, but with a slight adjustment, as outlined presently. 
Level 1 You will have successfully met checkpoint 4.1 at the minimum level if The content has been reviewed and is believed to have as many of the following characteristics as possible, taking into account its purpose and subject matter (better wording could be used here): [Avi's list of level 1 characteristics belongs here, with a different numbering scheme - perhaps letters or Roman numerals, or perhaps as an "unordered list" (e.g., XHTML UL element)] Level 2 Same format as above. 
Level 3 You will have successfully met checkpoint 4.1 at level 3 if 1. New material is tested with potential users for ease of accessibility. 
2. A controlled language is used. 
3. Support for conversion into symbolic languages has been given. 
Note that my purpose here is not to express any opinion as to the items that Avi and Lisa have included in their list, but merely to suggest a way in which the success criteria can be reworked so that the non-testable items are actually included, but without reducing the requirement for testability as such by specifying review and assurance requirements as success criteria, in accordance with decisions that the working group has already taken. 
The main elements of this proposal already have precedence in our guidelines. 
Some individual success criteria already contain lists of items (typically unordered lists). 
We have already decided, though it has not been implemented in a draft yet, that to satisfy a review requirement an implementor must take into consideration the various non-testable factors that the guidelines specify (presently in "additional ideas" sections). 
Given that these items must be taken into account in conducting to review, there seems little reason why they shouldn't be listed as items under the review requirements themselves, in the "success criteria" section of each checkpoint, except, as already noted, for those items that truly belong as additional suggestions. 
This proposal therefore makes no substantive change to what is normative or to any of the working group's decisions regarding testability. 
It also ensures that the non-testable items, which would be listed under review requirements, become part of the "success themselves and cannot be so easily overlooked or omitted from checklists. 
As a corollary, we can establish several rules for checklist generation (this brings us to the other item on tomorrow's meeting agenda: 1. 
A checklist must list all of the guidelines and checkpoints in WCAG 2.0. 
2. If the checklist relates to a particular format, API, protocol etc., or to a combination thereof, and there are no relevant techniques for a particular checkpoint, this must be stated explicitly following the text of the checkpoint itself. 
3. If there are relevant techniques for a particular checkpoint included in the checklist, then they must be listed under the relevant success criteria. 
Furthermore, all success criteria for the checkpoint must appear in the checklist, even if the techniques only address a subset of them. 
Precise details of format could be worked out later. 
The principal reason why all review requirements have been placed at level 2 in earlier drafts is the concern that, in making a conformance claim, an individual or organization might incur liability in virtue of having made a warranty regarding the accessibility of web content. 
Now that we no longer require (except perhaps at level 3, as discussed in a recent meeting) that conformance claims actually be published (or made public), this justification for restricting review requirements to level 2 is no longer valid. 
One can simply meet the requirements but keep the conformance claim private. 
Note that WCAG 1.0 does not require publication of conformance claims (cf., the discussion of "closet conformance claims" following the publication of WCAG 1.0 as a Recommendation), so we would not be departing from precedent. 
I also think that the warranty argument is suspect on its own terms. 
All one is claiming is that a review has been conducted and produced certain results, not that a third party carrying out such a review would arrive at the same conclusion. 
We may not be *requiring* conformance claims, but we do allow and (I trust) encourage them; so perhaps we should leave the review statement in place as a level 2 success criterion. 
Moving it up to level one would place a substantial burden on individual developers and small shops, who should (in my view) be able to make voluntary conformance claims at level one. 
The caveat Jason mentions below still applies: other parties may review the material and reach different conclusions about its conformance.

we had similar wording originally but changed it to require review of each instance that the author dose not conform the concern behind the change was a practical one. 
We wanted to avoid people just taking a quick look at the content and saying "oh yeah this content is as clear as appropriate" It seems more rigors to require review of each instance were the author dose not conform - less easy to justified passing content as conformant without an in-depth review.

Avi, Lisa, and Lee, Thanks for the proposal. 
I really like stating these as questions. 
Just a couple quick comments before we start the telecon. 
I want to point out the work going on in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Education group on labeling the audience of content. 
Please refer to a working draft from 2000: I am trying to figure out the current state of the DC-Education proposal. 
there is a level 2 success criteria under checkpoint, "Checkpoint 1.6 Provide information needed for unambiguous decoding of the characters and words in the content." that reads, "abbreviations and acronyms are clearly identified where they occur." 
and it references checkpoint 4.3. 
"Checkpoint 4.3 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with summaries and definitions." 
which has a level 1 success criteria that says, "acronyms and abbreviations are defined the first time they appear." 
Thus, a couple questions to answer: 1. is providing expansions for acronyms and abbreviations a level 1 or level 2 success criterion? 
2. the difference between the two success criterion is that at level 2 we say "identify where they occur" while the level 1 says "defined the first time they appear." 
(There is an open issue related to the definition of "first time" http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wcag20-issues#691) 3. Do we choose one checkpoint for this success criterion or are there really separate criteria? 
4. Is there overlap between the checkpoints that we need to address or is this redundancy necessary? 
Thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative Avi, As promised, here are some specific comments on your proposal for success criteria for 4.1. 
This is a difficult topic to tackle and you, Lisa, and Lee are to be commended for attempting it. 
I have copied the text from your post to the mailing list and followed each item with my comments, prefaced by AS. formats. 
Which format do you prefer? 
The items at Level 1 are phrased as statements. 
The items at Level 2 are phrased as questions. 
AS: I prefer the format of level 1 because I think it is easier to convert this format to test cases. 
answers on deliberation of each item and the reasons for any exceptions. 
AS: I'm not sure what this means. 
It sounds like I meet the criteria if I consider each item. 
If the web page doesn't meet an item, all I have to do is explain why I chose not to meet it. 
So, if the web page doesn't conform to a particular requirement but I explain why I didn't, then the web page conforms to the checkpoint? 
AS: Remove this. 
At the minimum level and Level 2, we should be providing specific, testable requirements, not general guidelines. 
user would need to understand the important content. 
AS: I have three issues with this one: 1. 
I disagree with any requirement for statements of conformance or support at the minimum level. 
2. Even if this is moved to level 2, it should not be required to be in metadata. 
None of the conformance statements for the other checklists are required to be in metadata. 
3. Web page authors should not be required to be knowledgeable about the cognitive skills required to read their content. 
The success criteria should state explicitly what we want them to do and any conformance statements should be related to these criteria. 
AS: What do we mean by accurate and how do you test that page titles are accurate? 
Requiring them to be unique within a site is okay. 
people within your intended audience. 
An informative section could list the various sorts of disabilities that might be found in example audiences. 
For instance, the audience of a professional journal might include people with learning disabilities or semantic-pragmatic disorder or first-stage Alzheimer's. 
AS: This is too restrictive for the minimum level which should be applicable to all sites. 
It is also too subjective. 
If we have a specific recommendation to make about words and language structure, we should only do so at level 3 or as an advisory recommendation. 
4. Terms that should be familiar to the intended audience are favored over terms that are less likely to be understood. 
AS: Every person who writes something is doing it to be understood and will think that they meet this criteria. 
I don't see any value add to putting this in the guidelines. 
list values specific to languages and disabilities AS: Does this mean you can't use compound sentences like "The dog is black and the cat is white." or "I wanted to buy a Porsche but it was too expensive"? 
This is too restrictive for the minimum level. 
I believe this is more appropriate for level 3 or as an advisory recommendation. 
AS: This is a requirement of good writing. 
Editors and English teachers can usually make this assessment but it would be difficult, if not impossible, for most of us. 
I think this is too restrictive for the minimum level. 
It is more appropriate for level 3 or as an advisory recommendation. 
intended audience would probably consider reasonable. 
AS: This is too subjective for the minimum level. 
We could recommend a maximum, but I think it is an advisory recommendation, not a requirement for conformance. 
introduces new concepts or terminology. 
AS: Is this "new" to the audience or "new" to the page? 
This sounds like one of the fundamental principals of designing web content. 
I think it is too restrictive for the minimum level and probably cannot be quantified sufficiently to be more than an advisory recommendation. 
abbreviations or acronyms. 
AS: How is the author to know? 
Is there an objective requirement we can articulate wrt abbreviations and acronyms? 
How about "All abbreviations and acronyms are links to a glossary that defines them"? 
This is too restrictive for the minimum level. 
Level 2 might be okay. 
If I have my address on a page, do I have to make St. (Street) and TX (Texas) links? 
understanding. 
AS: What specifically are we requiring here that is different from #8 and #9? AS: Does this mean the content is available to assistive technologies that can render it in simpler forms? 
If so, we should figure out what those requirements are and that should be the success criteria. 
AS: Don't summaries always aid understanding for some people? 
We could recommend specific cases where summaries are recommended as a Level 3 requirement or advisory recommendation. 
context. 
AS: Okay for Level 1 or 2. deliberation of each item and the reasons for any exceptions. 
AS: Same comment as for Level 1 AS: Same comment as for Level 1 ways to communicate with people with cognitive and other disabilities? 
AS: What is the requirement here? 
Is there a certification we are requiring of web authors? 
AS: I'm not sure what we mean by "names and labels" in a document? 
Is it terminology? 
AS: Does this apply to languages other than English? 
Even for English, this should be Level 3. voice in English and other languages) favored over those that reduce understanding? 
Examples in techniques AS: Using the word "favored" makes this too subjective. 
I'm not sure we can come up with a specific recommendation (like active voice in English) that applies across languages. 
AS: I don't know what a simple verb tense is. 
Does it apply across languages? 
AS: This might be an advisory recommendation but is too subjective for success criteria. 
AS: This might be an advisory recommendation but is too subjective for success criteria. 
AS: Is this a requirement for context sensitive help? 
AS: Is this a requirement that instructions be in bulleted or numbered lists? 
If so, we should say that but it should be Level 3 or advisory. 
AS: Not sure what the requirement is here. 
understanding? 
AS: Not sure what the requirement is here. 
AS: Linked text is a way to get more information. 
Does this require that all links must also have a duplicate "Click here for more information" type of link? 
any slang or idiomatic language? 
AS: How is the author to know? 
Either articulate a specific requirement with regard to slang or idomatic language or remove. 
any jargon? 
AS: How is the author to know? 
Either articulate a specific requirement with regard to jargon or remove. 
users within the intended audience? 
AS: How is the author to know? 
Is there something specific we can recommend as an advisory recommendation? 
i.e. don't use metaphors, don't use satire, etc. AS: Not sure what the requirement is here. 
AS: We already have a requirement for this in checkpoint 1.3 AS: I know what object-action is but not goal-action. 
What type of menu prompts are we talking about? 
AS: A good requirement for forms. 
first? 
AS: Advisory Recommendation, not Level 2 as vertical lists of items (especially in the case of instructions)? 
AS: We already have something that attempts to cover instructions (Level 2 #9). 
Unless we have another specific scenario where we want to recommend that bulleted or numbered lists be used, this should be an advisory recommendation. 
selections for critical functions? 
AS: A good requirement for forms critical functions (such as how to delete an item from a shopping cart)? 
AS: We already have a requirement (Level 2 #8) that covers explaining choices and options. 
AS: A good requirement supported? 
AS: How would the author know what would be helpful? 
You will have met Checkpoint 4.1 at Level 3 if at least one of the following is true: AS: I think this is an advisory recommendation for the entire guidelines, not a conformance requirement for any one specific checkpoint. 
AS: Can we articulate specific requirements here?
