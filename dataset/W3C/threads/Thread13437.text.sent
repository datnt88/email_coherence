BTW, Have you been using WAVE ( most useful? 
what if any features would you want to see added? 
Please don't be shy about telling me about problems or shortcomings. 
(After all, I already have a big list* grin ). 
Len p.s. * list of shortcomings/problems includes Only shows noframes If you click on a link in wave output it goes to the raw page, not the wave processed page Doesn't handle pages with CSS postioning Applies only a handful of the 80 ERT techniques... although it's the few that I think cause the most troubles Output says "for explanation read the tutorial". 
People don't read tutorials. 
I need to include short explanations in page. 
Needs more summary data to orient user, e.g. N pictures without ALT text.

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) I have used it a few times. 
It is useful for determining table linearization order. 
FYI The process that I usually use to quickly check out pages for accessibility is: 1. Look at the page in Opera w/images off. 
Opera easily allows me to switch back and forth between viewing images or not. 
Also, I use Opera to look at use of style sheets (again I can turn this on/off easily), pages without scripts (my default setting is to load scripts, but most scripts only sniff for Navigator and Explorer, therefore usually break on Opera which is always fun to see unless it crashes my machine which is fairly often), I don't have any plug-ins loaded for opera. 
2. Look at media-rich pages in MSIE5.0 to get the full effect. 
3. If I'm doing something more in-depth i'll run bobby. 
4. i always end up looking at the code because the visual appearance of pages is deceiving due to clever HTML tricks. 
For example, I had thought yahoo was using style sheets to create bullets for lists. 
turns out they use the following: &amp;#183; a href="foo.bar" 
Foo /a BR &amp;#183; a href="foo2.bar" 
Foo 2 /a BR 5. i'll often use lynx. 
6. depending on how in depth the review is, I will probably call a few other people to look at the site. 
automate that!! grin I don't have suggestions for what to add, although picking any P1 from the ERT that has not been implemented would be a start! 
grin --w wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa Opera does indeed give a much better a pure text look than WAVE, and the toggling is very sweet. 
Do you think I should add a mode to WAVE that toggles the images? 
BTW, when you're running WAVE you can also look at the ALT tags for image maps areas... 
I don't think opera shows them, or at least I haven't been able to figure it out.
