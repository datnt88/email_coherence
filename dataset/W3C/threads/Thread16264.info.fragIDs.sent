<s> Hello All: I've come across an interesting article which states that the Victoria's Secret site is a completely accessible site.  </s>
<s> It was picked as the site of the week by CommArt.com (just for Valentine's Day!) and the article is located at http://www.commarts.com/interactive/index.html.  </s>
<s> The site is located at http://www.victoriassecret.com.  </s>
<s> I looked at the site in IE 5.0 with the graphics turned off and javascript disabled.  </s>
<s> The top of the page lacks alt tags for graphics, etc. and it is only when you scroll to the middle of the page that your see the "text only" link.  </s>
<s> This links to the bottom of the page where all of the categories are listed in a site map style layout.  </s>
<s> However, when you select the links from this page, you are directed back into the graphic pages with haphazard "alt" tags, etc.  </s>
<s> And the descriptions for the items seem to lack essential information for someone who is visually impaired to truly understand what they are trying to purchase.  </s>
<s> Once you click to the item's page, there is a decent description of the item, but the color, size and quantity are presented in three separate drop down boxes.  </s>
<s> I checked the URL against Bobby and it passed with the exception of one instance where there was no provision of alternative content for each SCRIPT that conveys important information or function, and they needed to ensure that descriptions of dynamic content are updated with changes in content.  </s>
<s> I would argue that they've attempted to make their site somewhat accessible, but they have not been completely thorough in providing alt tags, etc. (This is just my opinion.)  </s>
<s> I'm working very hard to understand how to make a site compliant, so, I'm always looking for examples of sites which are designed with accessibility in mind.  </s>
<s> Any opinions on this site would be appreciated, and should be interesting considering the subject matter!  </s>
<s> Thanks for your input.  </s>

<s> In addition to the problems you noted with this site a couple of pages into  </s>
<s> it, it starts using frames that have no titles and there does not appear to be any noframes so I would say this NOT an accessible site.  </s>

<s> It's not accessible, not even the home page.  </s>
<s> It spoofs Bobby (not deliberately, Bobby is easily confused by JavaScript).  </s>
<s> I will try to give more details tomorrow.  </s>
<s> The "real" URL (that a text browser gets redirected to) is at: Paste that URL into Bobby and you will get MUCH different results than the "false positive" that comes up by default.  </s>
<s> I don't think Bobby's problems with JavaScript are documented anywhere, but it has come up on this list before.  </s>

<s> Okay, I took a second look.  </s>
<s> We need a new word, or at least omnipotent powers to stop others from abusing OUR term.  </s>
<s> We use the term "accessible" to mean "accessible to persons with disabilities" a la the WAI / WCAG.  </s>
<s> It is easy to forget that the general public doesn't adhere to this "jargon".  </s>
<s> I believe the CommArt author is just saying that the page is "usable" or "available" or "nicely done".  </s>
<s> Yes, our use of the word has more semantic meaning and is better, but so what?  </s>
<s> With this kind of complicated page, the easiest way to confirm that it is NOT accessible is to do a "View Source" and do a search for Q img src /Q .  </s>
<s> Sure enough, this turns up ALT free graphics (looks like mostly spacer .GIFs in this case, but still a P1 violation) and large .GIFs that are probably part of the menu bars with ALT="" (another P1 violation).  </s>
<s> Before anyone takes the "Kynn Challenge" for this home page, I have to point out that there are thousands (millions?) of commercial web sites that are just as inaccessible as Victoria's Secret.  </s>
<s> Do we have any reason (except for the non-functional "Text Only" link) to believe that VS is any more aware of the issue than most?  </s>
