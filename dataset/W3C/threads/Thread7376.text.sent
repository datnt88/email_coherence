The no-tagged production of an If header is to be applied to every resource to which the method is applied. 
This production can contain both state tokens and etags. 
I understand why the no-tagged production is useful when it contains a state token. 
Many distinct resources can be in the same state. 
I do not understand why this production can contain an etag. 
Unlike a state token, an etag can match at most one resource, and the only way a client could have an etag in the first place is by already knowing the resource. 
So it would always be possible for the client to use the tagged production. 
Can someone provide an example of when it would ever make sense to include an etag in such a production? 
The only reason I can think of is to allow the client to transmit slightly fewer bytes on the wire. 
I am not calling for any changes in the protocol or documentation, but would like to know whether I missed something. 
Jim 650-812-4301 My interpretation of the No-tag-list production in an If header is that is is used for those cases where the condition (a list of state tokens and/or e-tags) applies to the (single) target resource of the request method, no other resource is effected. 
The Tagged-list production is for methods that effect more than one resource and therefore need to provide matching conditions for each. 
I could also probably come up with some fairly convoluted example where you could use an untagged If header with an e-tag on a Depth Infinity method but that would be besides the point. 
The real point is that we generally don't ban something unless we have a reason to. 
Since we didn't have a compelling reason to keep e-tags out of untagged lists and there is occasion that they could actually be useful in an untagged list, we decided to just allow them.
