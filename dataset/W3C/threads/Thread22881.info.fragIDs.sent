<s> In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces, under Interface CSSValue, regarding CSS_INHERIT: It seems to me that the valueType CSS_INHERIT is orthogonal to the other three specified values of valueType (CSS_PRIMITIVE_TYPE, CSS_VALUE_LIST, CSS_CUSTOM).  </s>
<s> The latter three express important sub-type information, yet CSS_INHERIT expresses how the value came to be.  </s>
<s> If one were to specify CSS_INHERIT, then sub-type information will be lost; if one were to specify sub-type information, then information about inheritence would be lost.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest adding an additional boolean attribute to indicate inheritence rather than misusing the valueType attribute.  </s>

<s> CSS_INHERIT is a special value which requires special handling in the CSS engine.  </s>
<s> The 'inherit' value should be supported by all CSS properties.  </s>
<s> So, according to this conclusion, we put the 'inherit' support on the CSSValue interface.  </s>
<s> If you explicit set a property to 'inherit' in your style sheet, you'll get CSS_INHERIT in your CSSValue with no sub-type information.  </s>
<s> You'll  </s>
<s> get the computed value from the computed style.  </s>
<s> It's a fact that setting a property from 'inherit' to something else (like 12em for example) introduces  </s>
<s> some constraints on the underlying implementation.  </s>
<s> It also means that you have to use the cssText property to do that or to use the setProperty method on the CSSStyleDeclaration interface.  </s>
<s> We don't consider this contraint as an issue since this is not a real common use.  </s>
<s> It could be a possibility except that I don't see what primitiveType should return if the value is 'inherit' and the underlying type is CSS_PRIMITIVE_VALUE.  </s>
<s> And this will be the same for CSS_VALUE_LIST (length == 0?) and all custom values in the CSS2 extension.  </s>
<s> When a value is CSS_INHERIT, you're not allowed to access the sub attributes or sub functions.  </s>
<s> Does it clarify your intend ?  </s>
<s> Philippe.  </s>
<s> I believe I understand now: if valueType is CSS_INHERIT then no other information is available from that CSSValue instance (although, what would cssText be in this case?  </s>
<s> "inherit"?); in this case, one must use ViewCSS.getComputedStyle(...).getPropertyCSSValue(...) to obtain the actual (computed) value.  </s>
<s> If this is correct, then some additional clarifying language would suffice.  </s>

<s> Philippe.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to clarify the difference between 'specified', 'computed' and 'actual'.  </s>
<s> 'specified': - in the CSSOM, we use 'specified' to reference the values of the style sheet.  </s>
<s> No computation at this level : 'what you get is what you write'.  </s>
<s> This is what you get in a CSSStyleDeclaration from a CSSRule.  </s>
<s> - the CSS2 spec uses 'specified' for the first step of the style computation.  </s>
<s> These values are not exposed in the CSSOM.  </s>
<s> 'computed': CSSOM and CSS2 are using the same definition for 'computed'.  </s>
<s> This is what you get in a CSSStyleDeclaration from a ViewCSS.  </s>
<s> 'actual': actual values are not exposed in the CSS OM. According to these statements, I updated the description of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface: "The CSSStyleDeclaration interface represents a single CSS declaration block.  </s>
<s> This interface may be used to determine the style properties currently set in a block or to set style properties explicitly within the block.  </s>
<s> While an implementation may not recognize all CSS properties within a CSS declaration block, it is expected to provide access to all specified properties in the style sheet through the CSSStyleDeclaration interface.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, implementations that support a specific level of CSS should correctly handle CSS shorthand properties for that level.  </s>
<s> For a further discussion of shorthand properties, see the CSS2Properties interface.  </s>
<s> This interface is also used to provide a read-only access to the computed to the computed values of an element.  </s>
<s> See also the ViewCSS interface.  </s>
<s> Note: The CSS Object Model doesn't provide an access to the specified or actual values of the CSS cascade."  </s>
<s> Philippe.  </s>
