A regular working group meeting will be held on Thursday, 20 hours Coordinated Universal Time (making it 10 PM in France, 4 PM in Boston, 6 AM Friday in Eastern Australia, just to summarize a few of the relevant time zones), on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, and with the following agenda: 1. Techniques document (latest draft) with changes integrated. 
2. Wendy's proposed WCAG 1.0 errata. 
3. The latest working draft of the guidelines. 
I am very leery of leaving the decision about importance entirely up to the author. 
When Gregg spoke of an author claiming that something didn't merit serious text equivalent materials (because it was "just eye candy" and not intended to provide significant semantics but only be for the attractiveness offered blindless people) it rang the kind of bell I hear in other accessibility cases: "we don't need an elevator, I've never seen anybody in a wheel chair on the second floor." 
A (perhaps specious) argument is that readers who can't see the eye candy might still have an important use for knowledge about it because they are Web designers or students of Web design. 
Even if 50 blind folks said they didn't care about this stuff, we must remember that such opinions are less significant than they seem because: 1) they don't know what they're missing; 2) there's a lot of "fashion" in what's *important*. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I agree, it is important to know what is being missed. 
However, it would be nice to be able to point out these artistic visual effects so that users who want to concentrate on the actual content can do it more easily. 
With equivalent elements it is easy to use class or other semantic definitions for these, with equivalent attributes it is a bit more difficult. 
We also need to define some agreed vocabulary for these definitions so that user agents can provide means for users to skip equivalents when so wished.
