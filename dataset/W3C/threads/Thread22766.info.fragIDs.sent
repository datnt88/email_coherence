<s> Hi, Few questions about DOM 2. 1 - DOM Range : Java bindings are great but why the static final variables are not converted to upper case (like in DOM core) ?  </s>
<s> see : StartToStart, StartToEnd, ... 2 - DOM Range : the Range interface has an IDL method called  </s>
<s> isCollapsed.  </s>
<s> Why the Java binding is getIsCollapsed() ?  </s>
<s> isCollapsed() sounds better.  </s>

<s> Thierry Kormann Koala/Dyade/Bull @ INRIA - Sophia Antipolis  </s>
<s> Interesting point.  </s>
<s> The standard Java (or, more accurately, Java Beans) design pattern is that getters for boolean properties have names which follow one of two patterns, either getWhatever() -- as for any other property -- or isWhatever().  </s>
<s> If the attribute's name is isCollapsed, then getIsCollapsed() may be confusing but does follow Java's conventions.  </s>
<s> isIsCollapsed() would be even more confusing, of course, but would still be formally "correct".  </s>
<s> I'm not delighted by the idea of making this a special-case in the conversion from abstract design to specific language bindings; I like the  </s>
<s> consistancy we've maintained so far.  </s>
<s> But it might be worth considering changing the property name from isCollapsed to simply collapsed.  </s>
<s> That would undo this minor cognative clash, and I don't think it would adversely impact comprehensibility of code.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Consistency -- the attribute is named "isCollapsed", and there's a consistent (and automated) mapping from attribute names to accessors.  </s>
<s> Information and a minor correction.  </s>
<s> The info: the pattern was first associated with IDL ... CORBA's C binding used it before Green, I mean Oak, I mean Java was much more than a dream.  </s>
<s> And I know that the folk who did the JavaBeans (oneword[tm]) stuff knew that convention quite well.  </s>
<s> The minor correction: attribute "X" may only map to "isX" if it's boolean, as it is in this case.  </s>
<s> That's a pure JavaBeans-ism, unused in DOM AFAIK.  </s>
<s> Cognate of what?  </s>
<s> :-) That'd mean "getCollapsed" in most IDL bindings, which would make more sense at least to me! - Dave  </s>
