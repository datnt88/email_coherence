<s> Any opinions on CppUnit?  </s>
<s> I used an earlier version on the xmlconf test suite for Xerces-C and it seemed okay.  </s>
<s> Using CppUnit to test both C++ and C implementations would reduce the work needed, but would be less than ideal for testing on platforms where there were no C++ compilers.  </s>

<s> This is a distinct possibility.  </s>
<s> It's definately farther along but doesn't look like there's much more code behind it.  </s>
<s> I can think of other advantages to using C++.  </s>
<s> One thing I like about Check is that it forks a process for the test so a segfault doesn't bring down the whole test.  </s>
<s> It took me all of about 15 minutes to get Check going so I might as well just go with that until I run into these problems Fred's talking about.  </s>
<s> Right now I'm off learning about XSLT and getting a little side tracked (stk.push(domts)).  </s>
<s> Mike May The Source be with you.  </s>
<s> I'm up to 63%: Checks: 282, Failures: 56, Errors: 46.  </s>
<s> Is there a curve in this class?  </s>
<s> As far as generating C from your templates is concerned results are good.  </s>
<s> I did have to go into a handfull of test cases and move linkedlist_new calls above linkedlist_add because you cannot allocate memory on the stack after code.  </s>
<s> I suppose the transform could reorder initialization elements of the List and Collections but I punted.  </s>
<s> You guys are doing a great job!  </s>
<s> Keep up the good work!  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike May The Source be with you.  </s>
