Any opinions on CppUnit? 
I used an earlier version on the xmlconf test suite for Xerces-C and it seemed okay. 
Using CppUnit to test both C++ and C implementations would reduce the work needed, but would be less than ideal for testing on platforms where there were no C++ compilers.

This is a distinct possibility. 
It's definately farther along but doesn't look like there's much more code behind it. 
I can think of other advantages to using C++. 
One thing I like about Check is that it forks a process for the test so a segfault doesn't bring down the whole test. 
It took me all of about 15 minutes to get Check going so I might as well just go with that until I run into these problems Fred's talking about. 
Right now I'm off learning about XSLT and getting a little side tracked (stk.push(domts)).

I'm up to 63%: Checks: 282, Failures: 56, Errors: 46. 
Is there a curve in this class? 
As far as generating C from your templates is concerned results are good. 
I did have to go into a handfull of test cases and move linkedlist_new calls above linkedlist_add because you cannot allocate memory on the stack after code. 
I suppose the transform could reorder initialization elements of the List and Collections but I punted. 
You guys are doing a great job! 
Keep up the good work! 
Thanks, Mike May The Source be with you.
