<s> Hi Ian, We have now completed the Danish translation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.  </s>

<s> Kind regards, Lars Lars Ballieu Christensen, Consultant Sensus ApS, Godth?bsvej 18, DK-3400 Hiller?d, Denmark  </s>
<s> Thank you Lars! I'll add the link to the list of translations and look forward to hearing news of the review.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I'd like to translate the XHTML1.0 Prop.  </s>
<s> Recommendation into Spanish, but since its review period has finished I don't know if it would be better to wait until the status of the document changes.  </s>
<s> ?Any suggestions?  </s>
<s> Juan Luis Lara Area Internet/Intranet Grupo CP Grupo Getronics laraj@grupocp.es  </s>
<s> I would recommend waiting until XHTML 1.0 becomes a Recommendation, perhaps in two or three months time.  </s>
<s> Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>

<s> Thanks Dave, I'll translate the Prop.  </s>
<s> Rec.  </s>
<s> just for internal use, to get familiar with the document and the terminology in Spanish (Jorge Lozano from Instituto Cervantes has offered his help and will give a look to the translation) and to make the document accesible to my workgroup colleagues at Grupo CP webteam.  </s>
<s> When XHTML 1.0 becomes a Recommendation it will be easier to make a good translation.  </s>
