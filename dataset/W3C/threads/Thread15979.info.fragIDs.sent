<s> Pentium III-only sites coming  </s>
<s> By DAVID FLYNN | INTEL is working with several Australian content providers to  </s>
<s> establish Web sites that are not only optimised for PCs based on the Pentium  </s>
<s> III processor but restricted to Pentium III machines.  </s>
<s> The program intends for each Web site to probe the PC and use the chip's Processor Serial Number (PSN) to identify a Pentium III client.  </s>
<s> ...the common goal is to usher owners of a Pentium III into special pages  </s>
<s> where content such as streaming media, 3D interfaces and animation have been  </s>
<s> peak-tuned to suit Intel's latest powerhouse processor.  </s>
<s> Sounds like a really dopey idea.  </s>
<s> About as dopey as the identity  </s>
<s> tracking on Pentium IIIs.  </s>
<s> I predict that this idea is dopey enough  </s>
<s> that it will die just from being dopey once the Pentium III marketing rush is over.  </s>
<s> You know, using the same technology I suppose one could always EXCLUDE Pentium IIIs as a way of protest.  </s>

<s> Well, I guess that's another black mark in Australia's copybook.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we do more good than bad though (smile).  </s>
<s> Whether the idea dies the death it probably deserves, or expands into the  </s>
<s> nightmare that people seem to fear, depends on how many people buy Pentium  </s>

<s> Brian, I don't want to dismiss out of hand the idea of content-negotiation and capability negotiation as a way to improve network performance.  </s>
<s> I am just concerned by the more common use of it, which is to send out a page aasying "Your browser can't handle this site.  </s>
<s> Get a better browser."  </s>
<s> The development of P-3 only sites is an example of this.  </s>
<s> Negotiating capabilities to send a cut-down version of an image to small-screen devices, for example, can reduce needless bandwidth load.  </s>
<s> This is good for accessibility, although it also raises accessiblity concerns (the problem arises when IE does the content and capability negotiation, unaware of the fact that the user has a screen reader which changes the whole profile).  </s>

<s> Point well taken, my apologies.  </s>
<s> However, getting back to the real accessibility issues surrounding the PIII chip and the Australian content providers designing sites specifically for the chip: They have obviously made a decision that their target audience is specifically the users who have the PIII chip.  </s>
<s> As for the rest of us whose target audience is not so narrow, just as they are using client detection to determine who can access these sites, we will continue to be able to do the same in our sites providing alternative content for the PIII chip without making this our only offering.  </s>
<s> Through the use of template based pages this can come from single versions of pages that are parsed on the server to determine from the client's capabilities which components in the page to deliver.  </s>
<s> David  </s>
<s> On the one hand, the development of new technology is a vital part of the endeavour to provide accessibility.  </s>
<s> Since the tools do not currently exist  </s>
<s> to access all the things which people use and love in the world, we must either innovate and create new tools, or stop people using any tool which is not currently accessible, in order to provide accessiblity.  </s>
<s> The second option is not viable in the general case.  </s>
<s> There are instances  </s>
<s> where it should be done (where two tools provide the same function, the one which provides it in a more accessible fashion should be used, and the other one not used.) but they don't generalise.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, there are two approaches to innovation.  </s>
<s> One is to simply try things, and see what should be tried next - a fairly simple incremental process of adding gadgets, bells and whistles to what we have.  </s>
<s> For accessibility, this simply implies that it is necessary to follow the world at a distance of two inventions, creating tools to work with each new bell or whistle.  </s>
<s> The other is to look at what is being done, what else it would be good to do, and what are the accessibility problems inherent in those activities.  </s>
<s> This change in the set of requirements should produce a sea change in the set of results produced: accessibility which is affordable, and up-to-date.  </s>
<s> My objection is not, therefore, to the use of new technology - Intel and I are both working on developing new technology.  </s>
<s> I am simply concerned that marketing pressure (and market pressure) will be used to encourage the growth of high-end wizrdry at the expense of general accessibility, instead of encouraging the expansion of accessibility because this might slow the rate of 'new-toy' acquisition.  </s>
<s> This is not something which can easily be reduced to hard and fast rules.  </s>
<s> If a bionic ear can be developed which will help people who are deaf to hear, then the fact that it only works for people who can operatee a physically small and complex device should stop its development (although development of other control systems should also proceed).  </s>
<s> It is my feeling that good corporate citizenship (by which I refer to corporations in the broad sense of the word, rather than the narrow commercial/legal definition) implies that a high-tech toy which makes a relatively small difference to most of their employees, at a serious cost to a few of their employees, would be rejected, and a better solution found.  </s>
<s> It would mean that the approach to innovation and development includes accessibility as a first-class technical issue to be dealt with in the design, not something which is added on afterwards if it is feasible.  </s>
<s> The fact that these ideas cannot be quantified or measured very easily simply means that they require a bit of thought to implement them, and that at the end of the day there will be differences of opinion as to how well anybody (including me) has succeeded in following them.  </s>
<s> But I think they are important ideas.  </s>
<s> And in so far as the use of new high-end gadgetry is touched on by those ideas, it is a topic related to accessibility, at a very fundamental level.  </s>
<s> (Which may not solve the problems of today, but may avoid diving into a future where the problems increase faster than they can be solved).  </s>

<s> I think Charles McCathieNevile addresses a frequently overlooked point here:  </s>
<s> Too often we are told "you can't do that on a web page because it's not accessible".  </s>
<s> It is, in my opinion, perfectly reasonable to create a web page that is inaccessible to a particular group, as long as an alternative method of providing the information to that group is also created.  </s>
<s> To simply reject a particular design strategy out-of-hand does a potential dis-service to the rest of your audience.  </s>
<s> To make a non-web analogy, consider access ramps to public building.  </s>
<s> Yes, sure, it is important to provide them for people who cannot use stairs.  </s>
<s> But should they replace stairs?  </s>
<s> No, they should run alongside them.  </s>
<s> If public buildings removed their stairs and replaced them all with lifts and ramps, then *I* would be disadvantaged, which seems a little unfair.  </s>
<s> Just my opinion.  </s>

<s> Ok ... here's another non-web analogy: What if you got to the ramp or stairway and were denied access to *either* because you did not have a particular component (ie; tatooed id number) embedded/stamped/burned in one of your body parts?  </s>
<s> (YIKES!!) The "ramps" are not at issue - it's the "stairways" that deny access to anyone who does not play (or is it pay?). Sorry for being silly as this whole issue... but after viewing the TV adverts I observe that those *able* to "open the door to PIII" are all children.  </s>
<s> (if you've seen the TV adverts you'll know what I mean) The message is loud and clear - it pushes the envelope and extends the issue of accessibility beyond those with disabilities and to a generation who have no earthly concept of the issues discussed here.  </s>
<s> A generation of whom, I fear, will swallow it happily and whole.  </s>
