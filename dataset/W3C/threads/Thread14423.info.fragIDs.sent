Hello, If Your site gets found on a major search engine you could suddenly find 1,000 visitors per day dropping by your web site. 
That's some powerful free promotion that might otherwise cost you plenty. 
A recent study of Internet traffic patterns revealed that nearly half (43.5%) of all search engine referrals are coming from Yahoo.com. 
That means that Yahoo.com can be a very powerful force in Your marketing strategy. 
Yahoo is notoriously slow in adding new submissions to their directory, and it can take as long as six months to a year to see your site listed in the Yahoo.com search directory. 
And just because you submit your link to Yahoo.com, doesn't guarantee that your site will even appear in their directory. 
I have discovered the incredible solution for You. 
And one that until now has been kept a secret. 
This information can easily bring you thousands of new visitors. 
And more visitors means more money for you. 
With my information your site will be found on Yahoo.com. 
PERIOD.
