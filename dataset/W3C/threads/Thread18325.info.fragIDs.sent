Comments on 23 March Draft 1. Are Checkpoints 2.5 and 2.6, special cases of Checkpoint 2.1? 
Do we need to put a reference in or possibly remove the checkpoints? 
2. Checkpoint 3.4: Add technique to configure to selectively turn off script execution. 
For example do not process user interface event handlers, or subsets of user interface event handlers. 
3. Checkpoint 4.11: Can we using "talking rate" instead of "playback rate". 
Playback doesn't seem to be the right term for synthesized speech. 
4. Checkpoint 5.4: Add onChangeEvent to example in the note 
5. Checkpoint 9.5 "Use make available" terminology, instead of query?

speech rate seems appropriate instead of playback rate.

I don't think we should remove the checkpoints. 
I am ok to add cross-refs. 
Ok. Actually, very much in line with your desire for increased granularity, I intend to add the following note to this checkpoint (and a similar one about style sheets later on): Scripts and applets may provide very useful functionality, not all of which causes accessibility problems. 
Developers should not consider that the user's ability to turn off scripts is an effective way to improve content accessibility; turning off scripts means losing the benefits they offer. 
Instead, developers should provide users with finer control over user agent or content behavior known to raise accessibility barriers. 
The user should only have to turn off scripts as a last resort. 
I agree with David's suggestion of "speech rate". 
Ok. 
Done. Thanks Jon, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783
