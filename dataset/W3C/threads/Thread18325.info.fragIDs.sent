<s> I don't think we should remove the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> I am ok to add cross-refs.  </s>
<s> Ok. Actually, very much in line with your desire for increased granularity, I intend to add the following note to this checkpoint (and a similar one about style sheets later on): Scripts and applets may provide very useful functionality, not all of which causes accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> Developers should not consider that the user's ability to turn off scripts is an effective way to improve content accessibility; turning off scripts means losing the benefits they offer.  </s>
<s> Instead, developers should provide users with finer control over user agent or content behavior known to raise accessibility barriers.  </s>
<s> The user should only have to turn off scripts as a last resort.  </s>
<s> I agree with David's suggestion of "speech rate".  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Done. Thanks Jon, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
