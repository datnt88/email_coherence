<s> There is a new article on the Making Connections Unit website:  </s>
<s> What is an accessible website?  </s>
<s> Attempting a definition.  </s>
<s> It is an attempt to find a way of thinking about accessible web design that addresses the needs of website producers, not just consumers.  </s>
<s> If you have never read any of the articles on the Making Connections Unit website before, this is the one to start with; I think it attempts to address some important issues.  </s>
<s> I expect there will be people who don't agree with the conclusions, or the approach taken to get to those conclusions - if so, but don't keep your thoughts to yourself, add your comments to the page or to the discussion forum.  </s>
<s> Or get in touch with me directly.  </s>

<s> Hi Jim Would the concise definition of an accessible website be just that - it is accessible?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I would separate a disabled person from the general person as you seem to imply with your initial bullets on "What is an accessible website?".  </s>
<s> Surely everyone means everyone regardless of their physical or metal condition.  </s>
<s> I would agree that given the state of current technology it would be a massive undertaking to translate your content into X languages.  </s>
<s> But wouldn't it be great if you could?!  </s>
<s> Your market reach would have no bounds.  </s>
<s> Consider that technology will catch up and develop your projects with that in mind.  </s>
<s> I've never considered writing style to be strongly connected to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Ok in the most part things should be kept simple but writing style is an expression of individuality.  </s>
<s> As long as whatever is written is accessible then that is what matters (and I'll stop myself there before I digress).  </s>
<s> Keeping up-to-date versions of a site (at its most basic : graphics and text only) is not be a problem if you consider that structure and content *should* be separated.  </s>
<s> Given the current technology available it is difficult to make content accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> But we should do all that's possible to ensure our projects are developed with the future in mind - look at the web 10 yrs ago who'd of guessed we'd be where we are now!  </s>
<s> Separate structure and content, keep reading WAI IG and your half way there.  </s>
<s> Kind regards Mike Palmer www.absoluteinternet.com  </s>
<s> PS : all the above is IMHO :)  </s>
<s> Hi Mike, What the article tries to do is find a definition that gives a 'framework for thinking' that leads to practical strategies for those building sites.  </s>
<s> Your definition doesn't really tell me how I should go about building an accessible site.  </s>
<s> I can't add to what is said in the article - it addresses your point directly.  </s>
<s> Near the end of the article there is the following paragraph, "With this definition our first thought is not to separate disabled people out as a special group to be catered for; there will be disabled people and non-disabled people in our intended audience.  </s>
<s> They will all be using a web browser of some sort and we will have done all we can to ensure our documents are accessible to those web browsers.  </s>
<s> No input or output device is more 'normal' than any other input or output device; you may be using a mouse and a monitor, someone else will be using a keyboard and a set of headphones.  </s>
<s> And if we are doing our jobs right as web designers, it won't make any difference - they will all still get the content."  </s>
<s> The point is that trying to make a site accessible to everyone is not a good idea in principle.  </s>
<s> It would be no more great than making all television programs aimed at adults accessible to children, or all television programs aimed at children accessible to adults.  </s>
<s> Not all content is appropriate to all audiences.  </s>
<s> As, I think it was Adam Smith, said, 'the problem with the long term, is that in the long term we are all dead'.  </s>
<s> We need to address todays concerns today.  </s>
<s> Excuse my directness - thanks for your thoughts.  </s>
