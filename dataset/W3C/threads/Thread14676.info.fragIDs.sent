Folks, Although I am not an "illustrator", I have been working on the challenge of illustrating the guidelines, starting with one of the versions of Guideline 3 ... I have improved? the illustrations to the best of my creativity, and have tried to change the alt tags to meet the needs of users, to the extent I have understood the needs in recent discussions. 
I have added some text to the guidelines to point out or explain some of the illustrations. 
These additions are in italics (as are the "notes" of the original guidelines) ... I have not attempted to create a page that reads like a radio script, since this is a web page, not radio. 
The illustrations created to do guidelines 3 will certainly be useful in illustration more of the guidelines. 
If there is some agreement that I am doing important work, and if the current work can be uploaded to the W3 site, I will tackle the rest. 
I do hope that my work will be helpful to a "real" illustrator who is enlisted or hired to complete the illustrations that are finally adapted for the guidelines ... Please let me have comments on all aspects of the illustrations and their text equivalents.

This is a long email, But I think we need to respond to the call for "hard facts" The first part of this email responds to what seems to be a misunderstanding about what dyslexia is. 
It is not about making things easy but it is a neurological condition that realities in some learning processes being impaired or disabled wilst others are more advanced. 
This email then discuses how dyslexic can learn, and how learning can be made easier. 
Also with full references and "hard facts" I then want to discuss the guidelines, and how this all fits together for us. 
If you get board - just skip ahead to this bit. 
But get there. 
It would seem, dyslexia is not a problem, but a symptom of a problem. 
It can come from any or all of the following courses. 
There are of course many other theories, but these are the main academically respected ones. 
All mainstream credible research in behavioral neurology agree that dyslexia is a consequence of an altered neural substrate with a reduced synaptic space, in the various regions of the brain which are responsible for the reading process. 
fMRI scans (18, 19) have show that different subgroups of dyslexia may exhibit under activity in any of the following areas: V5/M - resulting in visual discriminatory problems (9, 15), auditory cortex - resulting in low auditory discrimination skills (32), superior temporal gyrus (Wernike's area) and striate cortex - resulting in a phoneme processing problem (5, 22, 23 ), and the angular gyrus - coursing pore cross modal associations (22, 24, 28, 30). 
The different schools of research have championed the different neurological bases of dyslexia, and its resulting subgroup of dyslexia. 
OK a bit on each one: Auditory Discrimination (main research - see Tallal et all (32) ) This body of research has shown that many dyslexics have defects in the left auditory cortex (responsible for sound naming and identification) and temporal processing. 
It is in the auditory cortex that sound identification takes place. 
In fRMI scans, dyslexics have shown reduced synaptic activity in this area. 
Clinical trials have shown that skills can be enhanced by a computer-based approach to tackle ?phonemes? - the individual sounds associated with words, with recorded spoken words. 
The consonants are recorded louder while the adjacent vowel is lengthened and its sounds softened. 
(For results of clinical tests see Tallal et all 1998(33).) Visual Recognition Skills (main school of research Livingstone (1993) and Martin and Lovegrove 1988) )(see 9, 15) Dyslexics have reduced synaptic activity in the V5 area. 
V5 is part of the broader "magnocellular -- large cell -- system" that processes fast-moving objects, and brightness contrasts. 
One interpretation is that a specific magnocellular cell type develops abnormally in people with dyslexia (3). 
Games and animation used to train the synaptic pathways in the V5/M area, will be governed by the following criteria. 
Adjustable flicker rate, maintained at the lowest speed possible for the child's recognition enhancement, adjustable brightness and contrast, and spatial frequency. 
Colors will be superimposed on black and white images to maintain the child's interest only, and emphasize the visual difference in shapes. 
For results of clinical tests see (1) Phoneme Processing Main research from Shaymitz (1998) and Rumsy (1996), (see 5, 10,11, 14 ?17) 
The language regions in the superior temporal gyrus (Wernike's area) and striate cortex are found to underachieve in the dyslexic. 
These areas response to simple phoneme processing tasks. 
(Areas that respond to more complex language tasks, an anterior region, the IFG, displayed relative over activation in dyslexics. 
) Games involving nonsense words, rhyme, and sound manipulation will be enhanced by special auditory effects: The consonants are recorded louder while the adjacent vowel is lengthened and its sounds softened. 
All games are carefully leveled by the complexity of the manipulations involved. 
(For results of clinical tests see Ojemann 1989, Bertoncini et all 1989 ). Cross-modal association Main research from Leon (1996) and Shaymitz (1998) (see 8, 22, 24, 28,30) The angular gyrus, a brain region considered pivotal in carrying out cross-modal (e.g., vision and language) associations necessary for reading, is involved. 
The current findings of under activation in the angular gyrus of dyslexic readers coincide with earlier studies of those who lost the ability to read due to brain damage centered in that same area of the brain. 
The ability to link visual stimuli to auditory interpretation can be stimulated by Multimedia implementation of the coming together of these separate disciplines. 
Activities are all carefully leveled to correlate the child's current ability level. 
Now let me try to explain what this means s in practical term and the ability to learn. 
Let us take someone with an impaired visual processing and memory V5/M25 - They are being told to remember what a letter looks like, they can not. 
So long as they are being told to read through the use of visual memory, you might as well ask them to walk on the ceiling. 
They can not. 
They do not have thoughs functions. 
They remain illiterate. 
Then comes multimodal teaching. 
You tell child to make a v shaped vase out of clay. 
To feel the point at the bottom. 
You have then associated the shape V with the word vase. 
That is learning. 
You can do this for each letter, but not for each word. 
Reading will never be though word recognition for someone without a visual memory. 
But once they have the ABC, they can read and write phonetically. 
Now some dyslexics have a visual memory but no phononim processing skills. 
They will need to recognize each word, and not learn phonetics. 
Ok we get the picture. 
It ain't easy especially since many of use have all the difrent subgroups. 
Also remember that unless a student has had the right teaching method they will be unable to learn to read. 
However what is clear is that for dyslexics to learn difrent teaching mechanisms must me used. 
In terms of using multimedia. 
In teaching dyslexics it is referred to as multimodal method of education. 
It is the recommended method to teach dyslexic by every dyslexia association I have been in contact with (BDA CDA LDA and the IDA) but if that is not enough then you can start reading (34,35,36) These teaching methods for LD persons in university are also recommended by the dyslexia association, (37) and infact the most acclaimed schools for dyslexia have e embraced multimodal teaching with excellent results (38). 
This is no longer about learning to read but about learning other information in such a way that the language problems do not restrict you. 
Dyslexic are advised to draw there thoughts out in a flow diagram or box form before answering a essay question or writing a letter. 
That way they can concentrate on the concepts and then separately concentrate on fitting the idea to the words, writing the words, writing the words in the correct order..... 
In compression dyslexic are advised to read the words and then go back and understand the content and then reread the words. 
slow but you get there. 
Now the guidelines. 
Dyslexia is a disabilty, therefore we have to address it. 
That I think is not debatable. 
I think that I have proved that using multi modal and techniques such as diagrammatic representations, will defiantly assist dyslexics follow and access information . 
If there is any doubt on that then tell me and I look up more facts. 
But most dyslexics have not been diagnosed (especially if they are over the age of 30) So if they have managed partial literacy though shear slog over years, then diagrammatic representation will mean the difference between being able to follow or access large pieces of complex information and not being able to. 
Many undiagnosed dyslexics drop out of society and into delinquency. 
(http://www.etni.org.il/dyslexia2.htm) (80% of homeless people who do not have an addiction or psychiatric problem are learning disabled. 
40% deliquesce...) Undiagnosed dyslexics have not been shown special coping methods such as making a block diagram in your head or on a piece of paper while following a comlexed instruction. 
They are in a much worse situation then I. They do not know what benefits are available, they do not know public information, unless someone bothers to tell them. 
They are intelligent, but they can not get to information that will help them learn. 
They are not blind, so have not learnt Braille and have never heard of screen readers. 
Along comes widely and publicly available information sources with the potential to all be in multimodal form. 
Please explain to me why ADA entities and federal sites, and people who just want to include as many people as they can, should ignore these millions? 
Hear are references, I got a bit feed up by the end, so ignore inconsistencies of style.

Hi Lisa, can you provide full references for the people you have quoted? 
Or at least enough to let me (a novice) find them in a library? 
That way it will be a 
lot 
easier to argue the case. 
I know this work is out there, I just don't know where to find it. 
And we need to hold it up very clearly to prove to people that it does already exist. 
Cheers Charles Now I now I do not represent every dyslexic on the plaint, and that there are many sub-groups of dyslexia, but I am one of the lucky ones who have some measure of all impairments that have been grouped together as 
dyslexia. 
In other words not all dyslexic will find it useful, but it seems to me 
that 
people with an impaired auditory memory (estimated at 60% of dyslexics - 
see 
the many works over the last 15 years by work by Tallal) and/or weak phonetic processing (possibly 80% Stanovich, et all, or Blachman) skills probably will. 
Lisa, Thank you for providing a lot of useful information that has greatly enhanced my understanding of these conditions. 
I don't think anybody is saying we should not try to include guidelines that help people with LD, CD etc, rather we are stuggling with just how to do that. 
In particular how to do that without making things harder for other groups at the same time. 
It is unfortunate, but a fact, that what helps one group may make life more difficult for others. 
An example in the "real" world is curb cuts. 
Absolutely needed for wheelchairs, loved by mothers with baby strollers and somehting generally liked by everybody once they got accustomed to the idea but ... Did you know they are a problem for the blind? 
Did you know that a curb cut makes it hard for many blind people to find the curb edge so they can line up to cross streets properly? 
What seems to be happening here is we have needs that conflict with each other, what makes it more accessible to one group interfers with the access of another and the requirements may discourage people from even trying to make things more accessible. 
I venture to guess that not so many years ago, before the GUI, those with LD, CD etc did not use computers at all. 
Now, with the GUI everywhere, and multi-media growing by leaps and bounds things are so tantalizingly close it must be a major frustration. 
I believe we fall back on the TEXT answer because we know the most about it, it was here before the GUI. 
Alt text and things like it are, after all only meant to provide access in a manner that exsisted before the GUI. 
What we are reaching for now is really new ground, and the more understanding we have of the needs of these groups the better chance we will have of developing good answers. 
Marti 
Did you know that a curb cut makes it hard for many blind people to find the curb edge so they can line up...properly? 
While this is true its inapplicability as an analogy is due to the fact that all proposals for guideline elements carry with them a means of modificability/refusability - they are not cast in concrete. 
Also you can 
find a little bit about how the curbcut ramp problem was seen by a blind guy who participated in these issues early on as well as the problems you cite could have been solved by proper implementation. 
Recommending multimedia (which we essentially already do) might need more prominence? 
In particular what we have the opportunity to do is to make our document be a self-reflexive example of dancing the dance we sing about in our song. 
One entry in the "Illustrating Guidelines" thread emphasized the importance for some people of the need to make a local decision as to what was the divisor between "enhancement" and "distraction". 
I'm lucky enough to be able to say that although I get the New York Times via the Web every day and it is bordered at its top and right side by supposedly attractive (distracting?) banner ads I couldn't tell you what they advertise if you put a gun to my head. 
There are techno means for stripping them for those who cannot, e.g. read the New Yorker magazine without attending to the advertising therein. 
I believe this spikes any argument that "what adds accessibility for some, reduces it for others". 
We might call for assertions (as in EARL) for what certain omissions/containments are based on as in "the prerequisites for accessing this textbook on thermodynamics is some knowledge of what 'thermodynamics' means" or "there are no animated graphics on this site" or "this site is usable by anyone with a 'grade-3' reading level (whatever that means!)." 
Any legacy sites will certainly be "grandfathered" in by whatever regulators take a part in all this, so that isn't really a concern. 
We cannot pretend that either in what the guidelines say, or in how they say it, that: multimedia is anything less than the norm of the Web; that our guidelines are exempt from their own provisions. 
It is regularly pointed out in this reasonably civil (though tediously interminable) thread that there is already language present in the guidelines/checkpoints themselves to cover most of what we're saying - it's just that the guidelines don't follow their own recommendations! 
DUH! Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Did you know that a curb cut makes it hard for many blind people to find the curb edge so they can line up...properly? 
I very, very strongly recommend reading that page and applying the lessons to what is going on here. 
If you publish a gudeline that says "Cut curbs at intersections", you will disable blind pedestrians. 
If your guideline says "Cut curbs offset by one meter from the center of the sidewalk", then you will enable wheelchair users and _not_ disable blind pedestrians. 
collaborative design was not followed elsewhere, with often disastrous results to many blind and low vision travelers." 
When you repeat history, the first time is tragedy; the second time is farce. 
The crosstalk on this list could be reduced if we agreed to take each other's concerns seriously, and acted accordingly. 
Let's start with the goal of making relevant web sites accessible to people with cognitive disabilities _without_ making them inaccessible to people with visual or motor or attention deficits. 
Can we try to write guidelines to do that? 
Adam Reed areed2@calstatela.edu 
Context matters. 
Seldom does *anything* have only one cause. 
I can not imagine that anyone (even on the WAI-GL) can disagree with that. 
This solution about the cut curbs was found by not running away from the problems and dichotomy that were encountered in creating this guideline, but by facing them head on and finding a creative way to resolve them. 
This attitude of late, of "this guideline has a problem/ is not practical - so let us scrap it" is beneath us. 
Lisa 
amen, brother! 
that's precisely one of the point i've been attempting to articulate for 
the 
past god-knows-how long -- false dichotomies are the most effective form of divide-and-conquer... accessibility isn't an either-or proposition, nor should it ever be presented as such, which is why any attempt to make WCAG 
a 
blueprint for "specialized" design runs counter to the very concept of accessibility... the entire point of WCAG is to provide solutions -- we simply need to step back, take a deep breath, and expend our energies on providing interoperable solutions -- a term which we must understand as pertaining not only to technology, but modalities and functionalities as well -- rather than in perpetuating threads in which we reargue the same issues we've been arguing for the past 4 years... which is why it is incumbent upon us, as a working group, to ensure that WCAG 2.0 is the synthesis of: technical expertise -- how does one break down barriers to comprehension 
and 
functionality in one modality without erecting barriers to comprehension 
and 
functionality in another? 
practical knowledge -- what is optimal, what is necessary, what is required by spec, what is interoperable, what is actually supported by the technology, how users use the technology, why, and how, and if, they can be convinced to change common sense -- or, rather, what i'd prefer to call "common sense", but which practical experience has taught me is more accurately called 
"uncommon 
sense", of which, intelligent curb-cut design is an excellent example real-life experience -- a large chunk of which consists of listening 
closely 
to what actual users have to say about what works and what doesn't, which also implies testing contested/competing solutions gregory.
