<s> hi Everyone, As yet another person who worked on the LSID spec (dereferencing scheme and the addition of RDF meta-data discovery &amp; retrieval), I have a supplement to Brian's question.  </s>
<s> BG This leads me to a question about "persistent" URI's and URL's  </s>
<s> BG (PURLS's): How do you ensure that two URI's are pointing at the same BG object (bytes)?  </s>
<s> My question is how does one programmatically identify a persistent HTTP URI, as opposed to one that will retrieve tomorrow's weather or perhaps retrieve a file from a P2P network or one that returns dynamically changing content?  </s>
<s> Apologies in advance if there is an obvious answer to this question.  </s>
<s> As to the question Greg originally asked which is why invent anything new since we already have HTTP URI's, my short answer is that they did not seem to be sufficient in themselves to address the problems that the LSID scheme was designed for.  </s>
<s> The scheme devised does of course lean heavily on HTTP URI's as probably the primary method of retrieval of the data object or meta-data about that object - after all much of the public LS data is actually out there on the web already retrievable by HTTP URI.  </s>
<s> If HTTP URI's were sufficient today, we would not have need of the LSID.  </s>
<s> So perhaps the question you should ask your self is why are people not already widely using URL's for LS naming?  </s>
<s> For me the main points are: Location independence of the object named - the extra layer of indirection makes this flexibility possible - there is a starting assumption that users will make/exchange local copies of the objects and also that authority entities will at some point want to transfer the authority over a LSID to another authority entity - while potentially maintaining control of their domain name, sometimes the same data is served from more than one "official" place on the web(e.g. Swiss-Prot - Marja, how does Annotea deal with this situation?), having the option of not using domain names in the identifier at all; Providing/using LSID's for one's data establishes a "contract" in which certain properties can be assumed (beyond those of the HTTP URI "contract") of an LSID named object: defines what can safely be assumed about multiple copies of objects which have the same LSID name - i.e. that they are identical; clear definition of what persistence means [both availability and never modifying a named object]; a formal mechanism for retrieving data [never ever changes] over multiple protocols and discovering and retrieving meta-data [which can change] about that object and its relationship to other objects [from the original source of the object or from a third-party who has something to add of their own] all using a single globally unique name.  </s>

<s> Subject: Re: Use of LSIDs in RDF Hello Everyone, I'm not an expert on URI's but, I am an author on the LSID specification and would like to clarify some issues.  </s>
<s> 1) URI's are a nightmare in the lifesciences.  </s>
<s> Particularly when used to encode semantic information about a particular entity that exists on the web.  </s>
<s> For example (from the DAS 1.0 specification): '/wormbase/das/elegans/features?segment=CHROMOSOME_I:1000,2000'  </s>
<s> This leads the programmer and biologist to certain conclusions about query semantics ie. what this URI encodes and (perhaps) what the programmer meant when using a certain encoding scheme.  </s>
<s> People infer meaning from a URI and learn this semantic very quickly.  </s>
<s> Some would argue that this is a good thing however, once the biologist trains themselves on this type of system, the developers of these systems are forever locked into this scheme of identification.  </s>
<s> This will forever become the identifier for this entity.  </s>
<s> In the case noted above, this is particularly cumbersome: If a researcher has started to annotate this region of the chromosome with metadata and the underlying data changes As with any scientific data, there must be a way to reasonably reproduce the evidence that lead to a particular result or hypothesis.  </s>
<s> By encoding things with URI's we do not guard against the fact that the underlying data may change.  </s>
<s> This leads me to a question about "persistent" URI's and URL's (PURLS's): How do you ensure that two URI's are pointing at the same object (bytes)?  </s>
<s> If we can collectively answer this question we can encode an LSID any way we please as long as we keep in mind that this information must persist as long as a journal or other well vetted scientific medium.  </s>
<s> 2) (sorry to be repetitive) Scientists typically perform research on the web as a supplemental exercise.  </s>
<s> By this, I mean that most researchers use data gathered from the web to enhance their knowledge about a certain gene, protein, transcript, chemical etc.  </s>
<s> This data is not typically referenced in a journal article etc. If we want to allow for the incorporation and dissemination of scientific information and knowledge across the internet as a common means of communication we need to ensure two things: a) Persistence b) Provenance Science requires that an experiment be reproducible by other researchers and that the discoverer/institution get credit for the discovery made or technique used to make the discovery.  </s>
<s> We must pay particular attention to this as we craft the LSID specification.  </s>
<s> 3) Browsers, HTTP semantics of query, RESTful interfaces, etc. are secondary to how data is used in the industry.  </s>
<s> Having a resolver to get at a particular piece of information should not be a huge barrier to the LSID specification's adoption.  </s>
<s> Case in point, IBM's implementation of LSID utilizes a COM plugin to allow users to perform LSID queries from a web browser.  </s>
<s> ie. lsid:// authority : namespace : identifier : version I hope this helps.  </s>
<s> I'll be posting specific examples of LSID in RDF in the next few weeks which I hope will help clarify this issue further.  </s>

<s> | I am not sure how to answer this ultimate question.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I need to | understand more about HTTP URIs in order to give comparison with the URN | used in LSID spec.  </s>
<s> To be honest I have tried to find more and I gave up | after reading very nice article about HTTP URIs by Tim Berners-Lee | (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI.html) that gave me feeling that I | am out of the league :-( I am by no means an expert on this either :) How URIs are used in the web architecture and the semantic web architecture are contentious issues to say the least.  </s>
<s> Given the importance of standardisation for the life sciences e.g. MAGE, I am simply trying to understand how identifier schemes such as LSID fit into the current thinking about the semantic web and URIs.  </s>
<s> |I think the question is mainly why reinvent a wheel that already exixts.  </s>
<s> Precisely.  </s>
<s> |Using persistent HTTP URIs is a good goal because it is standard and there |exists a lot of HTTP based applications e.g. browsers that understand HTTP |URIs and can provide information of the resource on the Web without |anything extra.  </s>
<s> This is the exactly the context in which I was trying to raise the issue of using LSIDs in RDF.  </s>
<s> Technically speaking there is nothing wrong with the current LSID specification IMO.  </s>
<s> However if I want to allow other users to dereference LSIDs that my authority mints, it requires me to maintain an LSID resolver.  </s>
<s> Clients must also have the necessary libraries to dereference the LSID.  </s>
<s> Having this infrastructure in place adds a practical burden to using LSIDs which would go away if LSIDs were to be specified in terms of HTTP URIs.  </s>
<s> Which, if we assume persistence is an organisational issue, then HTTP URIs are just as good as URNs.  </s>
<s> While the RDF spec says nothing about URIs being dereferenced to provide representations, my practical expectation is that they should i.e. it makes that resource more useful if I can get either a representation of that resource or metadata about that resource.  </s>
<s> The LSID does specify interfaces for retrieving metadata about a LSID which is a good thing.  </s>
<s> However I'll leave the "how to get metadata about a resource" question for later...  </s>
<s> This leads of course to the thorny issue of whether HTTP URIs are names or locations or both.  </s>
<s> My simple view on this is that a HTTP URI is a name in the same sense that the LSIDs are names, however it *may* also be dereferenced to provide a representation of the resource that it is naming (using the existing web infrastructure).  </s>
<s> |When somebody defines a URN they can usually as well reserve a HTTP URI |e.g. http://www.lsid.org/ and define URIs under it e.g. |http://www.lsid.org/path.../enzyme1.  </s>
<s> This maybe one possible solution, however the LSID spec says nothing about this.  </s>
<s> |Why we are now ALSO discussing of using UUID URNs is because we have |problems with local file: type URIs (file: URIs e.g. file//marja/myfile123) |and we want to make them unambiguous when a user cannot do HTTP URIs maybe |because a user does not own a http:// domain name where to publish it or |for some other reason.  </s>
<s> I can see this as an issue for individuals creating local stores of annotated bookmarks.  </s>
<s> In the case of the life sciences it would be easier to control as any authority using HTTP URI based LSIDs would need to have a http:// domain name to participate.  </s>
<s> |After publishing we mostly want to use the HTTP URIs to be able to benefit |from the common Web standards.  </s>
<s> But it is also possible for some application |to benefit from the URN bit of the information when so wished.  </s>
<s> Maybe there is a best of both worlds approach ?  </s>

<s> Hi Greg, GT I am not aware of a way to programmatically identify a persistent HTTP GT URI.  </s>
<s> Making URIs persistent is largely a function of who is responsible GT for maintaining that URI's authority.  </s>
<s> and GT This "contract" is a social contract, persistence based on a social GT contract can also be true of HTTP URIs.  </s>
<s> That is one of the main difficulties with the HTTP URI used on its own for our purpose - that it has to mix up unique naming, with the current location &amp; access [and to only a single copy of the object].  </s>
<s> If this were not problem enough, it has historically provided access to both unique objects and objects that change.  </s>
<s> Given any random URL, you have no idea how you can actually treat it in your program - there is just no way to tell that it is actually a name of something rather than just the network location of an object or concept that has perhaps a dynamic expression.  </s>
<s> There is also no way to determine which particular "social contract" applies to this particular HTTP URI.  </s>
<s> This seems to me to be partly because URL's have been used (abused?) in so many different ways in the past and partly because they try to do at least two or three things at once.  </s>
<s> I am not sure how one either could undo this past or provide the extra facilities required without introducing something new.  </s>
<s> In contrast, any LSID starts out unambiguously with both social and technical contracts that provide certainty both on what sort of thing you are getting and the multiple ways in which you might get it.  </s>
<s> You can actually code a program around its use and recognize it for what it is - a unique name for something - at first sight without accessing it.  </s>
<s> In most cases it maps down to HTTP for actual access, but this does not always need to be the case.  </s>
<s> It is important that first and foremost, the LSID is unambiguously a unique name for something that might have many copies stored around the network.  </s>
<s> I believe this is why a URN spec.  </s>
<s> was chosen.  </s>
<s> Resolution was secondary.  </s>
<s> The technical contract of the LSID primarily gives you a standard method to enquire for where those places to obtain an exact copy of this particular object are (and there could be many, including some place local to your organization) and secondly a standard method to enquire widely (at the original authority, at other trusted authorities, at your organization, or an organization you collaborate with) about those places where information about this object and its relationships to other objects can be retrieved.  </s>
<s> If there ever was any reason at all to create a URN, I believe that uniquely identifying life science information is a reasonable one.  </s>
<s> The earliest web standards define how URN's should be named and the RFC's also provide guidance on creation of methods for dereferencing them.  </s>
<s> There are also a whole bunch of more recent standards like SOAP and WSDL that seem to have gained wide acceptance.  </s>
<s> Why not use them?  </s>
<s> The use cases fit.  </s>
<s> The fact that this LS URN and its specification is backwardly compatible with the web, using its name resolution and access protocols as well as a future semantic web seems all the better to me.  </s>
<s> The alternative is to attempt to shoe horn the problem into a protocol that was not designed to meet the needs.  </s>
<s> GT People are using URLs (HTTP URIs for naming), for example: GT http://www.biomedcentral.com/pubmed/12225585  </s>
<s> Is this really a name for something or just a convenient link to something?  </s>
<s> In the context that you give it, it appears to me to be more like a link.  </s>
<s> NCBI have an entirely different name(s) for this thing.  </s>
<s> A third party providing a similar convenient link would have created a third name.  </s>
<s> If all places had used the LSID (urn:lsid:ncbi.org:pubmed:12225585:1)  </s>
<s> we (and our software) would know they were all talking about the same thing without having to do a thing.  </s>
<s> Now if we actually want a copy of it, we dereference it to fetch one via of any of those three HTTP URI's.  </s>
<s> Similarly if we want to know more about it, we ask places that may have metadata for it.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the LSID getAvailable method might be updated to make use of the URIQA protocol URL's as one possible way of implementing the get getMetadata method (URIQA style HTTP URI links could be provided as the port types in the returned WSDL).  </s>
<s> GT However HTTP has the 3XX error codes to provide redirection etc. Which HTTP URI is the unique name now?  </s>
<s> The original or the new location?  </s>
<s> Furthermore, how can I tell these two names are equivalent and reference the same object, especially as some folks discover and link to the newer name?  </s>
<s> GT One aspect of this that bothers me though, is GT partitioning of the semantic web into domains based on their metadata GT access interfaces.  </s>
<s> Access to metadata based on URIs alone only makes GT sense to me if the mechanisms to get the me is general for the web.\ Good point.  </s>
<s> The metadata access mechanisms for LSID's are mapped down onto exactly the same HTTP URI's everyone uses today.  </s>
<s> No point in reinventing a wheel.  </s>
<s> GT It is true that only the widespread adoption of LSID will make it GT useful to the semantic web.  </s>
<s> I am guessing by default (laziness ?) GT HTTP URIs will be used as resources identifier if a LSID is not GT *easily* usable i.e. tools, tools, tools... Yup :-) but don't forget that LS information on the web tody is not generally in any kind of semantic web right now - it is just plain old web.  </s>
<s> Many people in the industry perceive the need for the LSID but have no particular interest in semantic web (yet!).  </s>
<s> However if adopting LSID means they now become part of a semantic web [because that's what the LSID spec.  </s>
<s> says to do], the semantic web folks might benefit.  </s>
<s> That is why it is important we get this right.  </s>
<s> PDB is definitely down at the moment.  </s>
<s> We are working with them to bring up the authority there again with both the latest code (their previous version was using an out of date spec.) as well as extensive meta-data - previously it was a bare bones amount.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately they are snowed under right now with a major release of new code for their web site and database.  </s>
<s> I am not sure why the NCBI authority is down for you.  </s>
