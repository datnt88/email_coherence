<s> A 404 Page not found response is a real page (it is only IE that provides its  </s>
<s> own page for this, removing the possibility for Web servers to provide some  </s>
<s> site-specific useful information).  </s>
<s> So you can edit this page and save it.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, you can already fix the link - there is no need to have an extra dialogue getting in the way before you do that.  </s>
<s> So I would prefer that this is not changed.  </s>

<s> Yes, this is true that there is nothing when working on a file: URI.  </s>
<s> I think in the specific case iof not being able to load a file that it would make sense to either provide, or have an option to provide, a page that says so and can be editied, the same way as a 404 page can be edited.  </s>
