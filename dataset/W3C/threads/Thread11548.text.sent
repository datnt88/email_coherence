Hello. 
I have a question about the second sentence of the last paragraph in section 8.4.4. 
For right-to-left flow, the horizontal distance between the left side of a b ox and the right side of the preceding box (or left side of the parent box i s no preceding box exists) is similarly determined by the source element's ' margin' properties. 
I wonder about the word "preceding". 
For example: DIV{direction:rtl} This is rendered as follows: 2napS 1napS In this stuation, SPAN1 has no preceding box. 
And I think that the horizontal distance between SPAN1 box and SPAN2 box is the distance between the left side of SPAN1 box and the right side of the"fo llowing" box. 
I'm sorry if it's my wrong guess. 
K.Okahashi e-mail:CZA20330@nifty.ne.jp Hello Mr. Okahashi, Are you trying to translate the CSS2 spec into Japanese? 
I would advise you to wait a bit with this, as the CSS2 spec is at the moment just a working draft. 
Of course, you can try to start work, for example by trying to find good Japanese equivalents for the English words appearing in the glossary. 
But in particular bidirectional text layout, as you refer to below, is not yet stable enough in my oppinion to be translated. 
[I am working, together with others, to make this more stable.] 
Regards, Martin.

I agree with Martin. 
I also no longer see the text in question in the spec, so we may have cleared up the problem.
