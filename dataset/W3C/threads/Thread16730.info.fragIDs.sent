All, we're having a discussion on campus, and I'd like a few more opinions. 
thanks in advance. 
1. 
The wiggle room on the deprecated code issue is the wording; it says "avoid" not don't. 
2. It is still necessary or maybe easier to use deprecated codes, particular attributes, at times to get pages to display correctly since style sheets do not always produce the desired results. 
XXX is correct that they don't adversely affect the accessibility of the sites and that is really the point. 
Until style sheets of some other method is universally adopted this will be an on going issue. 
I think we should try to not to use dreprecated code but we should get to hung up on it either. 
I commented on the use of the ATTRIBUTES "bgcolor" with the BODY tag, "align" with the P tag, and "width" with the TD tag. 
The XXX webmaster thought I was referring to the ELEMENTS like BODY,P, and TD instead of the ATTRIBUTES like "bgcolor","align",and "width". 
I'm also referring to the specific combination of ATTRIBUTES/ELEMENTS since those attributes are not depricated everywhere. 
Guideline 11.2 says "Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies." 
The example that the guidelines refers to is the FONT element, but if they meant just elements then they would have used the word "elements". 
They refer to both elements and attributes on their techniques page. 
If you look under each of those elements then you will see that those attributes are depricated. 
The reason that I bring up the depricated attributes issue is that the "bgcolor", "align", and "width" attributes are used on most 
web pages and most people don't realize that they've been depricated for certain elements. 
I think that the guideline is quite clear that 
you can't use these attributes, but there's probably not any impact on accessibility if you do.

forms accessible and will continue to use the Adobe Portable Document Format until another solution is available. 
These forms, however, are excluded from the current section 508 requirements. 
Specifically, section 1194.22(n) of the regulations, published on December 22, 2000, states that: "When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues." 
As our forms cannot and are not intended to be completed online, they are currently not covered by the regulations. 
One has to distinguish between two cases here: - style sheets don't produce the desired results because the browser implementation is broken - this is I think the reason for the exception; - style sheets don't produce the desired results because the desired results require a level of presentation control that HTML is not intended to deliver - in this case, either work within the spirit of HTML, or use something, like PDF, whose design rationale is tight presentation control. 
Note that broken implementations are a particular problem because well structured HTML is usable without presentational features, but can become unusable if presentational features are implemented in broken ways. 
NS4 has poisoned CSS by making the fallback be broken presentation rather than default browser presentation. 
bgcolor and align are absolutely deprecated. 
I suspect that even some of the uses of width are only un-deprecated because the corresponding CSS feature was not introduced until CSS2. 
Most people are not aware that anything has been deprecated. 
Most people call elements tags and one, off topic, question on the www-html list called attributes tags! 
At worst, the impact is probably no worse than misuse of the equivalent CSS (e.g. poor colour contrasts, references to the colour of text to identify it, etc.). 
However, their use tends to be symptomatic of tag soup page construction, although style attributes, id selectors and authoring tools whose user interface gives the appearance that presentational features are being applied directly to the text, have the same problem. 
As our forms cannot and are not intended to be completed online, they are currently not covered by the regulations. 
I'd guess it was within the letter but not the spirit. 
It does seem to mean that one is left in the worst possible position with only an effective paper form, as PDF forms can be made online completable, either with online submission, or for subsequent printing. 
That's definitely going to help people with poor dexterity, compared with paper only, probably helps people with poor eyesight, as they can enlarge the form easily on screen, and will help the blind to the extent that the assistive technology is up to it. 
If one wants to avoid the original problem, you need to have legislation requiring electronic forms in the first place. 
If that forces Acrobat forms off government web sites, Adobe needs to provide authoring tools to make the forms accessible and work with assistive technology suppliers, to ensure that the markup from those tools is used. 
Sure. 
The law that requires that the service available (filling out forms) be accessible in general may or may not come under a provision of 508 on a different basis.But if you mean "are the regulations only meant to apply to stuff that is designed for online use?", the answer is that the bit of them that deals with online use is. 
If this webmaster manages to convince the complainant that someone else in the department is responsible for this proble, then they will have to take it up with the someone else. 
I would suggest it is a high-risk strategy, as well as basically foolish, since it would probably be easier to allow for online form filling, even if that form subsequently has to be printed and posted. 
Just my 2c from the foreign peanut gallery.

Dear David (and others), 
What is the CCS technique for centering a table over all on a page WITHOUT causing text in each cell to be centered? 
I was trying to upgrade a page to HTML strict, but could not find an equivalent for the table attribute Q align=center /Q . 
Thanks.

The reason that I bring up the depricated attributes issue is that the "bgcolor", "align", and "width" attributes are used on mostbgcolor and align are absolutely deprecated. 
I suspect that even some ofthe uses of width are only un-deprecated because the corresponding CSSfeature was not introduced until CSS2. 
[snip] 
The block element that defines the "page" (or one within it with no margins, etc.) should have styles of display: block and text-align: center. 
All thead, tfoot and tbody elements for the table should have styles including text-align: something other than center (a selector of "table *" should do this). 
The table, itself, should have a style of display: inline-table. 
This is the theoretical position from CSS2, although I don't have a CSS capable browser on this Linux system, to check it. 
Practical considerations might dictate specifying display: inline before display: inline-table, and it wouldn't surprise me if some browsers, incorrectly, centered the table, with default styles (which would not normally be inline-table). 
You should also consider using percentage margins and percentage widths, which are likely to look rather better when extreme font sizes are used. 
Of course, the deprecated state of align is independent of whether or not you can achieve a particular presentational effect. 
A better way of doing this, than my original, is use a auto width for both margins. 
This won't work on the basic CSS2 spec, but there is an errata that specifically permits it.
