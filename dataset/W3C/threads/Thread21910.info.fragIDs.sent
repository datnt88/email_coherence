<s> Was about half way through a commit, when something snapped.  </s>
<s> It seems to be something broken with the CVS client for Windows that just kills any interaction with the repository either as a known user or anonymous.  </s>
<s> The repository looks fine from cvsweb and from Linux, but I get this message (which I think Mary was getting earlier in the week) even from a machine that I just put cvs on.  </s>
<s> Trying to check out 2001/XSL-Test-Suite seems to work just fine.  </s>
<s> C:\domts cvs checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite cvs server: Updating 2001/DOM-Test-Suite  </s>

<s> You can actually commit changes as long as your working directory is deeper that DOM-Test-Suite.  </s>
<s> Looking at that level in CVS web (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/) there is a mysterious entry for a / (unnamed)directory.  </s>
<s> Don't know how that got there, but could see how it could confuse a CVS client.  </s>
<s> The checkout on Linux also had an unnamed directory.  </s>
<s> Mary and Dimitris, see if these tricks allow you to access with CVS.  </s>
<s> Phillipe, could you have someone kill that unnamed directory (if that is the right thing to do.)  </s>
<s> This seems to be a pretty serious problem; it's making life pretty miserable for the Windows users out there.  </s>
<s> ;-(  </s>
<s> For the command-line-savvy, it may be worthwhile to try the classic command-line interface.  </s>
<s> Links to the implementation and instructions for setting up command-line SSH and CVS clients are at:  </s>
<s> Everyone using Windows at PythonLabs uses the installation procedure described there with good success.  </s>

<s> The unnamed directory causes the command line CVS to fail.  </s>
<s> I didn't try any of the multi-check out combinations under WinCVS.  </s>
<s> Don't know what put that phantom directory there, my guess is that WinCVS had something to do with it.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, someone with file system rights can delete that thing and we will be golden.  </s>
<s> So, what do you suggest as the plan of attack for Python?  </s>
<s> Do you want to hack test-to-java.xsl  </s>
<s> yourself or manually transliterate some of the generated Java source to Python and let me see how close I can get the transform to produce the same code.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
<s> Or rename it, if there's anything in it (though I don't *think* there's any reason to expect that).  </s>
<s> Were the CVS hosted at SourceForge, we could file a service request, but it shouldn't be too hard for this.  </s>
<s> (Philippe, can you email the right sys admin?)  </s>
<s> I'd like to try my hand at the XSL myself, but be prepared for questions.  </s>
<s> ;-) I don't think there's any way for me to get to it this week at all; I'm falling behind in a major documentation project as we type.  </s>
