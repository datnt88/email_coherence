One of us ( and I don't think it's me ) has a bad e-mail address for Marc Hadley. 
His address is marc.hadley@sun.com 
( NOT marc.hadley@uk.sun.com ) Can everyone please check there contacts list and amend as necessary? 
Thanks Gudge I know that at least I got tricked because the "human friendly" name was marc with a "c" but the actual email address was mark with a "k". 
Also I have noted that the uk address doesn't work anymore. 
Henric or just hadley@sun.com if you want to save yourself some typing. 
Marc.
