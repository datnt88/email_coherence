<s> I found interesting this mensurability of the contrast.  </s>
<s> I noticed that the complementary colour (directly opposite to each other in the colour wheel) combination has the highest contrast.  </s>
<s> "Split complementary is a colour and the analogous colours to its complement color.  </s>
<s> Using split complementary colours can give you a design with a high degree of contrast, yet still not as extreme as a real complementary colour.  </s>
<s> It also results in greater harmony than the use of the direct complementary."  </s>

<s> In my experience, red and green are considered complementary [1,2,3,4].  </s>

<s> Another source names the complementary pairs as [6]: green and magenta, blue and amber, and blue-green and red.  </s>
<s> If red and green are complementary, there is at least one exception to the complementary rule: don't use green and red together (unless it is ok to miss the information presented in an overlap of the two colors).  </s>
<s> What about the other definitions of complementary colors?  </s>
<s> Is it ok to overlap red and blue-green?  </s>
<s> Reading Aries's pamphlet [5] it seems that red on blue-green is OK as long as you use dark red against light blue-green and don't use light red on dark blue-green.  </s>
<s> Joe's book seems to support this when he says, "Don't set green on red or red on green....unless: The items have considerable difference in brightness....If the lightness contrast is _indisputably_ high, you've solved the problem."  </s>
