<s> I would like to be able to hide optional end tags (e.g. /p ), but preserve the html , head , and body tags.  </s>
<s> This is what I thought "hide-endtags" meant.  </s>

<s> Eric, if you specify the --hide-endtag option and not select XHTML output, optional end tags are obmitted.  </s>
<s> Which options did you use?  </s>
<s> Out of curiousity, why would you want to suppress the optional end tags?  </s>

<s> Good point, the option name is a misnomer, it doesn't hide end tags, it hides optional tags and the p end tag is as optional as the html, head, body and tbody start and end tags.  </s>
<s> I am sorry, but Tidy is not able to do what you wish.  </s>
