Hello A colleague of mine has asked if there is any information on metadata and accessibility. 
I've not really come across anything about this - can anyone help? 
Thanks very much Kirsty Baker Open University Library Hi, yes there are a few bits and pieces. 
First, there is a PICS scheme for identifying WCAG conformance of pages dating back to June 1999 - There is the EARL project, which aims to use metadata to provide detailed information about accessibilty assessments - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl 
There is the RDF-based text-only SVG viewer - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ASVG which builds on some work in chapter 5 of the "Accessibiltiy Features in SVG" Note - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access Brian Kelly of JISC in the UK has also done some work on this topic... 
From time to time I talk about the topic - an example of some simple slides is at http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/0506-semwai/slide1-0 but that misses the bits that I explained during the talk... cheers Charles McCN Hello A colleague of mine has asked if there is any information on metadata and accessibility.

Thanks very much Kirsty Baker Open University Library Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) You pretty much have to get involved in the process by which this is emerging. 
It hasn't been reduced to cut and dried handbook stuff yet. 
The current generations of WAI draft guidelines say "use it." 
The EARL development in the Evaluation and Repair group is working on one way to share such information. 
In terms of a concrete proposal for an access-related vocabulary in which to say things, I would give the lead to the IMS Project as who will probably have a proposal on the table first. 
If your friend has any willingness to _do something_ about this beyond a "just tell me what I have to do" approach and can't figure out what to do next, please have them get in touch with me. 
Al Kirsty, You and your colleague might also look at the Dublin Core metadata standard, although you may already be familiar with it give your library association.

The SALT Partnership (Specifications for Accessible Learning Technologies) is working on extending the IMS specifications to handle accessibility needs. 
Metadata is one of the specifications we are examining right now. 
We are looking for ways to code information about the accessibility of instructional materials so that they can be delivered to users with disabilities in the most appropriate way, based on a profile of the user's needs. 
Our Working Group includes some folks from the Open University. 
Martyn Cooper and Chetz Collwell of the PEARL Project are contributing their efforts to design an XML-based user profile/interface to our specifications work. 
A project description for SALT is at: The IMS Accessibility Working Group web page doesn't have much on it as we have just gotten started, but it is at: The PEARL Project is at: I hope this information is useful to your colleague.
