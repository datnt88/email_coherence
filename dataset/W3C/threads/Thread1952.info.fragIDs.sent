Patrik, Patrik I have as Area Director got a request to publish the named I-D as Patrik Informational RFC. 
I hereby would like to get input from the Patrik Applications Area on the document. 
Given that that they are seeking Informational, rather than standards track, I assume that an IETF review should focus on whether the specification has misrepresentations and whether it conflicts in dangerous ways with any IETF effort. 
I assume that the IETF should NOT offer any standards-oriented language, such as "this looks like a useful protocol". 
So, my own reading is: This is a thoughtful effort that discusses related efforts. 
It states what problem it is trying to solve and it states its reasons for its technical choices. 
I am not aware of any conflicts or misrepresentations from this work. 
For work of this sort done now, it is surprising that the specification invents a new syntax, rather than using XML. 
However is nothing "dangerous" or otherwise inappropriate in the syntax choice they have made.

First, I like to note that Informational appears to a reasonable track for this document. 
It basically documents an existing approach. 
Security Considerations It should be clearly noted that protocol provides only a simple clear-text user/password authentication mechanism. 
It is also noted that the protocol does not provide any mechanism to establish data integrity and/or data confidentiality services. 
As such, I believe some statement of limited applicability would be appropriate. 
IANA Considerations 
The document does not request the registration the URI scheme it details. 
Also, the document does not establish any IANA 
registries but appears to have a number of extensible fields. 
Also, the Section 1 sentence I am distinctly aware of all complexities connected with USP implementation, but standardization always brings more benefits, 
than problems. 
implies that this document USP is being standardized. 
It's not. 
I suggest replacing the word "standardization" with "formalization". 
Lastly, in doing a quick review the document, I noticed a number of editorial issues and the usual nits. 
These I will raise to the author separately (with CC to the Patrik) when I get a chance.

KDZ Security Considerations KDZ It should be clearly noted that protocol provides only KDZ a simple clear-text user/password authentication mechanism. 
It is stated in unit 7. Concerning security, the USP defines only authorization mechanism and requirement to the USP server and the client realization. 
This document does not contain explanations of data loose protection during its transmission over the transport channel or special traffic coding against the grabbing. 
These tasks are duty of the transport layer protocols using by USP. 
KDZ IANA Considerations KDZ The document does not request the registration the URI scheme KDZ it details. 
I looked RFC2396,2317,2318 concerning this question. 
All necessary information, for the URI definition is contained in the document. 
But, is it necessary to group or to extract definition into appendix. 
It will be great to have the reference to an example of correct registration. 
KDZ Also, the document does not establish any IANA KDZ registries but appears to have a number of extensible fields. 
You are right, the registration necessity for RPC interfaces is supposed in order to prevent the naming conflict. 
Whether is it IANA function? 
KDZ Also, the Section 1 sentence KDZ I am distinctly aware of all complexities ... Probably, it is better to remove this sentence. 
KDZ Lastly, in doing a quick review the document, I noticed a number KDZ of editorial issues and the usual nits. 
These I will raise to the KDZ author separately (with CC to the Patrik) when I get a chance. 
Thanks for your comments; they are really worth.

DC Given that that they are seeking Informational, rather than standards track, DC I assume that an IETF review should focus on whether the specification has DC misrepresentations and whether it conflicts in dangerous ways with any IETF DC effort. 
I assume that the IETF should NOT offer any standards-oriented DC language, such as "this looks like a useful protocol". 
We have chosen Informational, because it describes that is already developed. 
If we shall see such necessity and if this protocol will be useful, it is possible to advance it up to standards track. 
In this case, it is necessary to apply a set of RFC published standards for improvement of the protocol, especially solving security problems. 
DC So, my own reading is: DC This is a thoughtful effort that discusses related efforts. 
It states what DC problem it is trying to solve and it states its reasons for its technical DC choices. 
DC I am not aware of any conflicts or misrepresentations from this work. 
DC For work of this sort done now, it is surprising that the specification DC invents a new syntax, rather than using XML. 
However is nothing "dangerous" DC or otherwise inappropriate in the syntax choice they have made. 
There are enough reasons to invent a new syntax instead of use XML. 
You can see in practice, how big and heavy the XML-based RPC calls looks like (XMLRPC and SOAP). 
I believe that XML has all possibilities for a complex data structure definition, however it does not provide sufficient possibilities, fixed at a syntax level, for the object definition. 
It is possible to describe objects, but there is some freedom degree in the invention of ways to do it. 
Have you noticed that there are many XML-based technologies, however they are incompatible with each other. 
XML does not provide node types in hierarchical structures, however nodes can represent either object or property or container for other objects. 
USP gives three levels of node classification: 1. node essence (part, object, member, folder) 2. node data type (plain, multipart, table, file, array) 3. node class I could give examples demonstrating advantages such syntax, its representational abilities and definition size reduction. 
But I believe that RFC publication is not a right place for such discourse. 
Best regards, Timur 
In short, this paragraph needs work. 
The terminology and language used is a bit odd. 
For example, "grabbing" could refer to a session hijacking or could refer to eavesdropping. 
I suggest you align the terminology with RFC 2828. 
I believe the IANA Considerations section to include (directly or in an Appendix) a registration template for each value it requests to be registered. 
See RFC 3368 for a recent example. 
For IETF Protocols, yes. 
See RFC 2234. 
You're welcomed.
