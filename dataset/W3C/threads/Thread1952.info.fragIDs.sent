<s> Patrik, Patrik I have as Area Director got a request to publish the named I-D as Patrik Informational RFC.  </s>
<s> I hereby would like to get input from the Patrik Applications Area on the document.  </s>
<s> Given that that they are seeking Informational, rather than standards track, I assume that an IETF review should focus on whether the specification has misrepresentations and whether it conflicts in dangerous ways with any IETF effort.  </s>
<s> I assume that the IETF should NOT offer any standards-oriented language, such as "this looks like a useful protocol".  </s>
<s> So, my own reading is: This is a thoughtful effort that discusses related efforts.  </s>
<s> It states what problem it is trying to solve and it states its reasons for its technical choices.  </s>
<s> I am not aware of any conflicts or misrepresentations from this work.  </s>
<s> For work of this sort done now, it is surprising that the specification invents a new syntax, rather than using XML.  </s>
<s> However is nothing "dangerous" or otherwise inappropriate in the syntax choice they have made.  </s>

<s> First, I like to note that Informational appears to a reasonable track for this document.  </s>
<s> It basically documents an existing approach.  </s>
<s> Security Considerations It should be clearly noted that protocol provides only a simple clear-text user/password authentication mechanism.  </s>
<s> It is also noted that the protocol does not provide any mechanism to establish data integrity and/or data confidentiality services.  </s>
<s> As such, I believe some statement of limited applicability would be appropriate.  </s>
<s> IANA Considerations  </s>
<s> The document does not request the registration the URI scheme it details.  </s>
<s> Also, the document does not establish any IANA  </s>
<s> registries but appears to have a number of extensible fields.  </s>
<s> Also, the Section 1 sentence I am distinctly aware of all complexities connected with USP implementation, but standardization always brings more benefits,  </s>
<s> than problems.  </s>
<s> implies that this document USP is being standardized.  </s>
<s> It's not.  </s>
<s> I suggest replacing the word "standardization" with "formalization".  </s>
<s> Lastly, in doing a quick review the document, I noticed a number of editorial issues and the usual nits.  </s>
<s> These I will raise to the author separately (with CC to the Patrik) when I get a chance.  </s>
<s> Kurt  </s>
<s> KDZ Security Considerations KDZ It should be clearly noted that protocol provides only KDZ a simple clear-text user/password authentication mechanism.  </s>
<s> It is stated in unit 7. Concerning security, the USP defines only authorization mechanism and requirement to the USP server and the client realization.  </s>
<s> This document does not contain explanations of data loose protection during its transmission over the transport channel or special traffic coding against the grabbing.  </s>
<s> These tasks are duty of the transport layer protocols using by USP.  </s>
<s> KDZ IANA Considerations KDZ The document does not request the registration the URI scheme KDZ it details.  </s>
<s> I looked RFC2396,2317,2318 concerning this question.  </s>
<s> All necessary information, for the URI definition is contained in the document.  </s>
<s> But, is it necessary to group or to extract definition into appendix.  </s>
<s> It will be great to have the reference to an example of correct registration.  </s>
<s> KDZ Also, the document does not establish any IANA KDZ registries but appears to have a number of extensible fields.  </s>
<s> You are right, the registration necessity for RPC interfaces is supposed in order to prevent the naming conflict.  </s>
<s> Whether is it IANA function?  </s>
<s> KDZ Also, the Section 1 sentence KDZ I am distinctly aware of all complexities ... Probably, it is better to remove this sentence.  </s>
<s> KDZ Lastly, in doing a quick review the document, I noticed a number KDZ of editorial issues and the usual nits.  </s>
<s> These I will raise to the KDZ author separately (with CC to the Patrik) when I get a chance.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments; they are really worth.  </s>

<s> DC Given that that they are seeking Informational, rather than standards track, DC I assume that an IETF review should focus on whether the specification has DC misrepresentations and whether it conflicts in dangerous ways with any IETF DC effort.  </s>
<s> I assume that the IETF should NOT offer any standards-oriented DC language, such as "this looks like a useful protocol".  </s>
<s> We have chosen Informational, because it describes that is already developed.  </s>
<s> If we shall see such necessity and if this protocol will be useful, it is possible to advance it up to standards track.  </s>
<s> In this case, it is necessary to apply a set of RFC published standards for improvement of the protocol, especially solving security problems.  </s>
<s> DC So, my own reading is: DC This is a thoughtful effort that discusses related efforts.  </s>
<s> It states what DC problem it is trying to solve and it states its reasons for its technical DC choices.  </s>
<s> DC I am not aware of any conflicts or misrepresentations from this work.  </s>
<s> DC For work of this sort done now, it is surprising that the specification DC invents a new syntax, rather than using XML.  </s>
<s> However is nothing "dangerous" DC or otherwise inappropriate in the syntax choice they have made.  </s>
<s> There are enough reasons to invent a new syntax instead of use XML.  </s>
<s> You can see in practice, how big and heavy the XML-based RPC calls looks like (XMLRPC and SOAP).  </s>
<s> I believe that XML has all possibilities for a complex data structure definition, however it does not provide sufficient possibilities, fixed at a syntax level, for the object definition.  </s>
<s> It is possible to describe objects, but there is some freedom degree in the invention of ways to do it.  </s>
<s> Have you noticed that there are many XML-based technologies, however they are incompatible with each other.  </s>
<s> XML does not provide node types in hierarchical structures, however nodes can represent either object or property or container for other objects.  </s>
<s> USP gives three levels of node classification: 1. node essence (part, object, member, folder) 2. node data type (plain, multipart, table, file, array) 3. node class I could give examples demonstrating advantages such syntax, its representational abilities and definition size reduction.  </s>
<s> But I believe that RFC publication is not a right place for such discourse.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Timur  </s>
<s> In short, this paragraph needs work.  </s>
<s> The terminology and language used is a bit odd.  </s>
<s> For example, "grabbing" could refer to a session hijacking or could refer to eavesdropping.  </s>
<s> I suggest you align the terminology with RFC 2828.  </s>
<s> I believe the IANA Considerations section to include (directly or in an Appendix) a registration template for each value it requests to be registered.  </s>
<s> See RFC 3368 for a recent example.  </s>
<s> For IETF Protocols, yes.  </s>
<s> See RFC 2234.  </s>
<s> You're welcomed.  </s>
