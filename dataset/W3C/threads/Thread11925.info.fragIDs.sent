To W3C Members Hello, my name is MAKI Kazuhiko. 
I'm a sutudent of Kyoto University, Japan. 
Recently, I privately translated the following two documents by W3C into Japanese: 1. http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere 2. http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/ ...and I'm planning to put them on my website and open them to the public. 
So I inform you of my plan as such. 
I'll comply with all you require at your document below: When my translation is put on the web, their URL will be: 1. http://kazmacky.cool.ne.jp/www/translate/here.html 2. http://kazmacky.cool.ne.jp/www/translate/raggett.html They are not on the web yet, but I'm going to put them in this March. 
When I put them on my site, I'll inform you again. 
Thank you for reading my not-good English.
