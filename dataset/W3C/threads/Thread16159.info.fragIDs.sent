<s> A user on the Web405 (Los Angeles area web people) list replied to me with the message quoted below.  </s>
<s> I've sent my answer to the list already, but can any of our "blind web users" and others with disabilities answer the question of "are separate text-only versions of a site good or bad, and why?"  </s>
<s> Your personal feedback would be welcome.  </s>
<s> No, text-only sites are less than optimal for accessibility reasons; a correctly done website doesn't _need_ a text-only site to be usable by everyone.  </s>
<s> What? Can you explain how a properly formatted, text-only site would hinder accessibility?  </s>
<s> Every blind web user I've talked to has said they much prefer them.  </s>
<s> They don't have to wade through 4 or 5 (or more) image tags before finding information, they don't have to deal with tables and text-flow problems, their screen readers go right to the text and they get their information quickly.  </s>
<s> (yeah, I know there are other disabilities out there, but I primarily think about "blind users" when someone says make a site "usable by everyone" because they present the greatest challenge to a visual designer) If a site is generated from a database, it's very little work to setup a text-only equivalent.  </s>
<s> Static sites are a little more work, but at the minimum I make a sitemap or table of contents that's text-only and uses no special tags.  </s>
<s> I agree that a correctly designed site can be useable by everyone, but I don't see how a text site can hinder blind users.  </s>

<s> Michael: I agree completely.  </s>
<s> I have voiced this opinion as well on the qed thread.  </s>
<s> Universal design/access means nothing if the word "universal" is ignored.  </s>
<s> Everyone must insist that the right to receive the same benefits from web-based information/services must apply to all.  </s>
<s> Whenever one subgroup is in danger of being denied this right, all other subgroups must also argue in support of that subgroup's right.  </s>
<s> We must all insist on universal rights, if not for the sake of our fellow human beings, the basis I prefer, at least for our own self interest.  </s>
<s> Normally, I do not post "I agree" messages to lists, since this can add an enormous amount of messages if everyone posts the same kind of message.  </s>
<s> However, in this case, I think it is extremely important that all groups concerned with universal design are reminded that the size of the population insisting on universal design is large indeed.  </s>
<s> As a member of the blind subgroup, I would like to argue as strongly for those who need a more graphical alternative as for a more text-based alternative.  </s>
<s> As to the substance of the technical issue of whether to provide a completely separate text-only version of a site, the main argument against this is simply the fact as others have pointed out, that this means that two versions of the site must be maintained and updated.  </s>
<s> The fact of the matter is that with proper, universal design, a site can be equally useful to all modes of interaction: there need not be a completely different version for each mode of interaction.  </s>
<s> The "alternative mode of interaction" need not be at the site level, but at the "information chunk" level (e.g. an individual picture, audio clip or method of giving feedback etc.).  </s>
