DanBri, Guus, I'm getting my head around the TP week... wondering when/if to present GRDDL at the SWIG meeting and/or the BPDWG meeting. 
(DanBri, I'll be in touch separately about a possible RDF calendar task force update.) 
I owe my time to the TAG on Tuesday, so I'd the SWIG discussed GRDDL on Monday if at all. 
EricM, thanks for the pointer from to the SWIG meeting. 
Now it's easy to find, but the BPDWG ftf agenda is still kinda hard to find. 
I still have to go back to Ralph's message of 2 Feb to the CG to find it... I see RDF-XHTML slated (v 1.6 2004/02/02 20:08:32) for Friday morning... hmm... that conflicts with an invitation to a Voice WG meeting to talk about TAG stuff. 
Hmm... still no "this is different from the best practices meeting" on the SWIG page, danbri... nor vice versa, Ralph/Guus. 
So I'm aware of at least one piece of feedback pending on each of those FTF meeting pages. 
Please address that issue and as many others as you can in the next day or so and let me know. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003? 
Pretty please?

[soory the late reply] I would wecome such a talk for the SWBPD meeting. 
The Friday morning would be the most approriate spot, I guess. 
Ralph, anything you can do about this?

I note that the latter is Member-ACL'd. 
It would be useful to have this public, so that SW IG members can see what's planned for thurs/fri. 
Is there any particular reason not to have it public? 
I'd like to put this on the SW IG agenda too. 
Can we have it be public, rather than having to cite earlier (public) versions? 
Re GRDDL, I'd welcome a lightning talk on this work. 
Any prefs re monday vs tuesday? 
Dan
