<s> Hi Keith, Someone gives me a page where TOM seems to work fine at TOM seems to remove images from my example page and no alt tags.  </s>
<s> Why are the images removed from that page?  </s>
<s> At the bottom of that page there is a buttonbar INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SRC="image.gif".  </s>
<s> The images.gif file is an image map.  </s>
<s> TOM does not see that it is an image map.  </s>
<s> Maybe it is difficult to handle this construction?  </s>
<s> Regards Peter Verhoeven Today I did some testing with the TOM tool and want to give you some feedback.  </s>
<s> I find that TOM only works on what I called here simple webpages, but not on more complex pages including IMAGE MAPS.  </s>
<s> At the webpage http://www.ns.nl/reisinfo/start.asp  </s>
<s> you can plan you travel by train.  </s>
<s> There are to IMAGE MAPS on this page.  </s>
<s> One at the top left and one at the bottom right.  </s>
<s> After entering the URL in the TOM tool I can fill the ALT tag for some images and the descriptions for the client side map.  </s>
<s> I can not fill descriptions for the image map (buttonbar) at the bottom right of the document.  </s>
<s> After processing the TOM form (I checked add alt tags) an document results that is not accessible at all.  </s>
<s> ALT tags are added to the client side map, but I don't see them at all.  </s>
<s> This is because my Netscape 4.5 browser does not support HTML 4 I think.  </s>
<s> After saving the page and changed the relative URLs to absolute URLs I see no image map at all?  </s>
<s> But this maybe caused by not loading the document from the original server.  </s>
<s> I think it is better to change such image maps in unnumbered lists?  </s>
<s> The buttonbar INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SCR="image.gif" has an ALT tag, but the IMAGE is a image map itself.  </s>

<s> Hi Nir,  </s>
<s> Yes, you are right.  </s>
<s> Someone on another list gives me the TOM works not well on the example I gave at the page and also a lot of other images on that page.  </s>
<s> I thin a bug in the tool.  </s>
<s> Point 2: Concerening INPUT type=image, it can operate like a server side image map, then there is no HTML mechanism to give alt text to the different regions.  </s>
<s> Making INPUT type=image a client side map is possible only with HTML4.0.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of IMAGE MAPS without AREA , most of them .gif files with more options.  </s>
<s> Is the information about the URL in the image?  </s>
<s> I thin it is important to make also these kind of maps accessible, because they seem very popular.  </s>

<s> Hi, Peter, Thanks for your feedback.  </s>
<s> First for the "disappearing image" problem.  </s>
<s> Were you running Tom in add mode or replace mode?  </s>
<s> Remember that the intent of replace mode is to totally strip out all images and make a text-only page.  </s>
<s> Add mode will add alt tags, but leave the images in the page.  </s>
<s> You'll want to use add mode.  </s>
<s> With your image map, I have actually never seen that type of construction used before.  </s>
<s> That can be added fairly easily, though.  </s>
<s> Tom is trained with client-side imagemaps created with the "usemap" attribute to the IMG tag.  </s>
<s> I appreciate your feedback very much!  </s>
<s> Remember, Tom is a work in progress.  </s>
<s> My studies and other activities have pulled me away from development of Tom over the past few months, but I'm still keeping a running wishlist.  </s>
<s> I'll add these to it.  </s>
<s> I hope I can get back in to the project soo, as well as find others who can also help.  </s>
<s> Thank you!  </s>

<s> Two points: Point 1: "ALT tags are added to the client side map, but I don't see them at all.  </s>
<s> This is because my Netscape 4.5 browser does not support HTML 4 I think."  </s>
<s> ALT is a required attribute for AREA elements already in HTML3.2.  </s>
<s> So this has little to do with support to HTML4.0.  </s>
<s> Point 2: Concerening INPUT type=image, it can operate like a server side image map, then there is no HTML mechanism to give alt text to the different regions.  </s>
<s> Making INPUT type=image a client side map is possible only with HTML4.0.  </s>
