<s> I totally agree with Al here and I would add this, the Late Len Kasday  </s>
<s> pointed out over and over that no tool can completely check anything for accessiblity.  </s>
<s> It takes human Intervention.  </s>
<s> It takes someone who knows what they are doing to check the results of the tools.  </s>
<s> Also Bobby can be downloaded from CAST.  </s>
<s> Al is right, you use this tool from the web for large projects and no one else can use it.  </s>
<s> I have had it happen to me.  </s>
<s> Al is also right in saying people should not expect to get a good analysis for free.  </s>
<s> Tbese things take time and skill.  </s>
<s> To expect to get it for free is totally unrealistic.  </s>

<s> If the folks at Bobby are concerned about abuse of their free services, I recommend they implement a way to limit the number of these free uses by IP  </s>

<s> If you set a limit of 25 pages per ip/site, you would pretty much curtail any abuse.  </s>
<s> Beyond the 25, the users should know whether or not Bobby meets their needs.  </s>
