I feed tidy the web page http://www.purl.org/net/lvirden/Pokemon/index.html and get back:" Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing console input (stdin) line 269 column 5 - Warning: a unknown attribute value "signal SEGV (no mapping at the fault address) in strlen at 0xff2b2be4 0xff2b2be4: strlen+0x0080: ld [%o1], %o2 Current function is tidy_out 33 vfprintf(fp, msg, args); (dbx 5) where [1] strlen(0x0, 0x0, 0x53740, 0x7efefeff, 0x81010100, 0x53528), at 0xff2b2be4 [2] _doprnt(0x0, 0xffbed344, 0x0, 0xff339731, 0x0, 0x5375c), at 0xff301568 [3] vfprintf(0x6f9b8, 0xffbed344, 0xff33d99c, 0x0, 0x53740, 0x1955c), at 0xff30345c = [4] tidy_out(fp = 0x6f9b8, msg = 0x53740 " unknown attribute value "%s"", ...), line 33 in "localize.c"

- - Larry, Problem is that attr is (nil) when ReportAttr called Problem caused by a href-"...." at line 269 of poke.html where it should be = To fix tidy (for this one only) change line 216 in localize.cpp 
to following tidy_out(lexer- errout, " unknown attribute value \"%s\"", attr ? 
attr : "NULL"); More correctly either this should be applied to all tidy_out s in thsi module or a fix put in tidy_out function. 
Tony Tony Goodwin how can I unsubscribe. 
Could one of the members please forward info.
