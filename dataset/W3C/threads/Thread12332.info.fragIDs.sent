<s> Hi all, Thank you Jan for your good work on images.  </s>
<s> This was a jump start for me and multimedia.  </s>
<s> The following stuff is also online at Accessibility Guidelines for Authoring Tools: Conformance Evaluation Process version 1.0d1 less than a draft, 9-5-2000 Matthias M?ller-Prove mprove@adobe.com  </s>
<s> W3C WAI Authoring Tools Guidelines Working Group (WAI/AU) Nearly 100% is leveraged from Jan Richards part on images.  </s>
<s> A more precice view is needed to suit this outline to the special needs of multimedia content.  </s>
<s> Part ##: Multimedia Definition: Equivalent Alternatives (EA) An equivalent alternative (EA) is content that fulfills essentially the same function or purpose upon presentation to the user as the potentially inaccessible primary content.  </s>
<s> EAs play an important role in accessible authoring practices since certain types of content may not be accessible to all users (e.g., video, images, audio, etc.).  </s>
<s> For more information, see the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> This document will refer to three priorities (1, 2 and 3) of EAs according to the priority assigned to it by the WCAG 1.0 recommendation.  </s>
<s> If a priority is not specified then all priority levels are assumed.  </s>
<s> The following is a list of EAs followed by their priority and the relevant WCAG checkpoint that assigned the priority.  </s>
<s> Scope of this part What is ?multimedia?  </s>
<s> content?  </s>
<s> some quotes from WCAG 1.0: These guidelines do not discourage content developers from using images, video, etc., but rather explain how to make multimedia content more accessible to a wide audience.  </s>
<s> While Web content developers must provide text equivalents for images and other multimedia content, (?) An auditory description of a multimedia presentation's visual track benefits people who cannot see the visual information.  </s>
<s> The Techniques Document discusses each checkpoint in more detail and provides examples using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), and the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML).  </s>
<s> WCAG Checkpoint 1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a visual track, provide an auditory description of the important information of the visual track of a multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] WCAG Checkpoint 1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] List by MIME types Mime type application/ smil x-shockwave-flash Mime tyoe audio/ basic midi wav x-aiff x-mpeg x-pn-realaudio Mime type image/ gif, in case it is an animated image svg-xml Mime type video/ avi mpeg quicktime x-ms-asf Mime type x-world/ x-3dmf  </s>

<s> Actually I think there is a class of objects which are used in Web content that is things with their own interaction properties.  </s>
<s> The simplest is an image map or a link, but also interactive multimedia and some applets (other applets are in fact just multimedia presentations coded in a procedural way... Another way of looking at it is to talk about "control logic" - a jargon term which means the ways that a user can move through an interactive set of choices or actions.  </s>
<s> This was what was discussed a bit in Hong Kong.  </s>
<s> It is a fairly important part of the typical design process for Interactive Voice Systems.  </s>
<s> VoiceXML, a language for describing such systems that was submitted to W3C and is available as a Note, see http://www.w3.org/TR in fact specifies a control logic (and quite an interesting one at that it seems).  </s>
