I have a Macintosh G3 Powerbook, and I installed OS X on it to try and install Amaya natively. 
The good news is that I know of at least one working installation of Amaya on OS X (on a G4 PowerMac - the big black ones) The bad news is that I could not get Amaya to compile on my system. 
I will post a screenshot and installation notes as soon as I have worked out how to do it. 
I had tried to use fink, which provides a debian-type system. 
It provides an Amaya source package for version 4.2.1 but couldn't successfully download the src tarball from ftp://fftp.w3.org 
So I downloaded the Amaya source and tried to compile it in /usr/local/ but compiling Amaya failed becuase it couldn't find the Motif libraries, which are in an unusual location with fink ( /sw/Lesstif/ - not Motif itself). 
When installed it runs fine. 
Possiblities I haven't tried: installing the gtk version. 
installing Motifnot Lesstif installing the 4.2.1 source as fink wants it and using fink to do the rest of the install. 
getting someone who has compiled it successfully to make a debian binary package -just thought this might be interesting. 
I will follow up the technical troubleshooting on amaya-dev but when I have some workable instructions that seem reasonably certain I will post the details here again. 
cheers Charles McCN Very interesting. 
Right now I'm using OS X as my primary OS at home, and wish I had Amaya on it. 
(I'm not quite ready to install X+GTK on my Mac, though). 
I'd be interested in more details later, if that doesn't bother anyone else. 
Thanks to Joel Rodrigues for the following link: it describes some more information about compiling Amaya, although it points to a version 3 source. 
Still hoping to make this work for me, but no more time to play with it. 
cheers Charles Ola todos, You're welcome, Charles. 
If anyone here succeeds in getting the current version of Amaya running, be sure to let us all know about it. 
I'll have OS X (10.1) within the next week, so I'll give it a go after that. 
I think it's time there was a distribution for Mac OS X available on the W3C Amaya site.
