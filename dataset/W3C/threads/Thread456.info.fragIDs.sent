<s> I downloaded the tidy source code on Sep 1st and I've found that the code that I downloaded is less forgiving than the official release of tidy 4th Aug 2000.  </s>
<s> I've attached 2 of the files that have been rejected by the new tidy but cleaned up by the old tidy.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason why the development team had made tidy tighter or less forgiving?  </s>
<s> It would be nice for tidy to be more flexible and take as much document as possible.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Patrick  </s>
<s> I was asking for comments in earnest and have been convinced (see my previous posting) that form begin and end tags should not cross table cells - especially since you can force output.  </s>
<s> That said, I believe de facto standards carry every bit as much weight as unimplemented "recommendations".  </s>
<s> I believe this is the spirit of both W3C and IETF standardization efforts.  </s>
<s> And, the fact is, all browsers do support the construction Allan is using.  </s>
<s> Are THEAD, TBODY, etc. portable across  </s>
<s> browsers?  </s>
<s> I just think it is really important to keep development grounded in what HTML coders use today.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> In past, I've made each row of a table into a form ( tr form... ... /form /tr ) but this is illegal?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> What is the alternative,  </s>
<s> Either or If this causes presentation effects your former approach doesn't, use CSS to change the presentation to your needs.  </s>

<s> I disagree rather strongly with this view.  </s>
<s> What HTML "coders" use today is invalid markup, necessitating that user agents attempt to guess the intent of the authors.  </s>
<s> Dave Raggett's original work on Tidy was a laudable effort to transform such invalid markup into compliant HTML, thereby removing that guesswork and broadening compatibility across user agents.  </s>
<s> To quote from Dave's original Tidy Web page: "Tidy corrects the markup in a way that matches __where possible__ [emphasis mine] the observed rendering in popular browsers from Netscape and Microsoft."  </s>
<s> The "where possible" here is crucial.  </s>
<s> If Tidy can divine the author's intent and reformulate it in compliant HTML, great.  </s>
<s> If it can't, then compliant HTML that comes closest to that intent should be generated.  </s>
<s> But either way, compliant HTML must be generated.  </s>
<s> Changing Tidy to generate broken HTML would be a serious mistake, in my opinion.  </s>
