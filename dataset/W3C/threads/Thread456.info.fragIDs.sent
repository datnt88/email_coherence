I downloaded the tidy source code on Sep 1st and I've found that the code that I downloaded is less forgiving than the official release of tidy 4th Aug 2000. 
I've attached 2 of the files that have been rejected by the new tidy but cleaned up by the old tidy. 
Is there any reason why the development team had made tidy tighter or less forgiving? 
It would be nice for tidy to be more flexible and take as much document as possible. 
Thanks, Patrick 
I was asking for comments in earnest and have been convinced (see my previous posting) that form begin and end tags should not cross table cells - especially since you can force output. 
That said, I believe de facto standards carry every bit as much weight as unimplemented "recommendations". 
I believe this is the spirit of both W3C and IETF standardization efforts. 
And, the fact is, all browsers do support the construction Allan is using. 
Are THEAD, TBODY, etc. portable across 
browsers? 
I just think it is really important to keep development grounded in what HTML coders use today. 
take it easy, Charlie 
In past, I've made each row of a table into a form ( tr form... ... /form /tr ) but this is illegal? 
Yes. 
What is the alternative, 
Either or If this causes presentation effects your former approach doesn't, use CSS to change the presentation to your needs.

I disagree rather strongly with this view. 
What HTML "coders" use today is invalid markup, necessitating that user agents attempt to guess the intent of the authors. 
Dave Raggett's original work on Tidy was a laudable effort to transform such invalid markup into compliant HTML, thereby removing that guesswork and broadening compatibility across user agents. 
To quote from Dave's original Tidy Web page: "Tidy corrects the markup in a way that matches __where possible__ [emphasis mine] the observed rendering in popular browsers from Netscape and Microsoft." 
The "where possible" here is crucial. 
If Tidy can divine the author's intent and reformulate it in compliant HTML, great. 
If it can't, then compliant HTML that comes closest to that intent should be generated. 
But either way, compliant HTML must be generated. 
Changing Tidy to generate broken HTML would be a serious mistake, in my opinion.
