<s> I have a navigation bar at the top of all my HTML pages.  </s>
<s> I want to put a "top of page" link at the bottom of any pages that are too long to fit in the window without scrolling.  </s>
<s> Is there any "event" based on scroll bars being present that I can use.  </s>
<s> I can't find anything in my javascript reference.  </s>
<s> Any help appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks Lorcan de brun  </s>
<s> No. You have the window.onscroll  </s>
<s> event (defined by both Netscape and IE) that fires, but nothing specified by the W3C.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the W3C DOM working group has quit developing (expanding) upon the HTML side of the DOM, and more the shame.  </s>
<s> Even though the data world is going XML on the web, the display is staying HTML.  </s>
<s> I wish they would focus some more time and effort to the interaction of the DOM with HTML, there is much more that needs done so developers can write once, run anywhere.  </s>

<s> Scrollbars would be part of the rendering of the document, and hence if the DOM handled them anywhere it would be in the "Views And Formatting" chapter -- which is currently on hold.  </s>
<s> Don't forget, you can send other events through the DOM's mechanism, so it's possible to standardize additional sets whether or not they're officially blessed by the DOM.  </s>
