hello all, The latest version of the guidelines is available for your perusal. 
Note that there have been quite a few changes since the last release (September 18). 
Most of them should be fairly obvious, but for a list see the history of changes at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-wd-changes.html http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wa i-gl-wd-changes.html 
The techniques document has not changed much since the last release. 
There are many links from the guidelines to the techniques document that don't have anchors on the techniques side (so you end up at the top of the document). 
Once we get a feel for the acceptance of this release, we will pound the techniques document into shape and create the content for the anchors. 
We look forward to your comments. 
See y'all on the call tomorrow, --the editors Is this the 11 November draft, or is there a later one? 
Charles McCathieNevile it's http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19981117 Don't be misled by the link text on the referring page which offers you the version from the 11th. 
There is a 17th version at the end of the link. 
Al whoops! 
The link from the home page has been corrected.
