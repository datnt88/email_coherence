<s> Hello, Since there is an owl:AllDifferent, why is there not an owl:AllSame?  </s>
<s> I have a need for it on my current project.  </s>
<s> It would be nice for it to have similar semantics to owl:AllDifferent.  </s>
<s> Thanks, - Ron Alford Ron Alford, KB0NUV  </s>
<s> Ron,  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comment.  </s>
<s> We introduced a AllDifferent construct because of the exponential growth of the number of differentFrom statements; see Sec. 6.3 of OWL Reference [1]  </s>
<s> For ontologies in which the unique-names assumption holds, the use of owl:differentFrom is likely to lead to a large number of statements, as all individuals have to be declared pairwise disjoint.  </s>
<s> The case is different for sameAs, because sameAs only leads to linear growth of the number of statements.  </s>
<s> (due to the transitive nature of sameAs, the statements "a sameAs b" and "b sameAs c" already imply "a sameAs c").  </s>
