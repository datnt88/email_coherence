<s> Comment: In line 21 of the HTML-Source Tidy interpret the ' ' sign false (JavaScript).  </s>
<s> That occurs many different warnings in the Error-Output-File and Tidy's-HTML-Output-File is completely false.  </s>
<s> Please let me know when the bugs are fixed.  </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> Hi Juergen,  </s>
<s> The HTML-source is not all right: see Regards, Christophe Christophe Strobbe K.U.Leuven - Departement of Electrical Engineering - Research Group on Document Architectures Kasteelpark Arenberg 10 - 3001 Heverlee - BELGIUM  </s>

<s> Your opinion isn't what counts here :) Validity is measured by the HTML specs and its formal definition as an SGML application.  </s>
<s> This issue is not a problem for browsers, which aren't real SGML parsers anyway.  </s>
<s> But the fix doesn't harm browsers either.  </s>
<s> See explanation.  </s>
<s> That might be a bug.  </s>
<s> Let's hear what the Tidy developers say about it.  </s>
<s> If you don't like having choices | Rijk van Geijtenbeek made for you, you should start | Documentation &amp; QA making your own.  </s>
<s> - Neal Stephenson | mailto:rijk@opera.com  </s>
<s> Case 1: As Christophe has pointed out, this is a valid warning and the escaped output is equivalent to your input.  </s>
<s> I.e. Tidy successfully fixes the problem.  </s>
<s> Case 2: Got one.  </s>
<s> See http://tidy.sf.net/bug/630990.  </s>
<s> Bj?rn is currently working on that exact problem.  </s>
<s> It was introduced by me g when I tweaked the parser to allow empty SCRIPT elements.  </s>
<s> See http://tidy.sf.net/bug/443678.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, the problem is easily worked around by adding a space after any plain "less than" operator ( ) in your Javascript.  </s>
<s> E.g. Change: for ( i=0; i N; ++i ) To: for ( i=0; i  N; ++i ) take it easy, Charlie  </s>
