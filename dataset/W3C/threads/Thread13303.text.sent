One thing that I have been wondering with Web documents, images etc. is if it would be valuable to be able to have alternate descriptions attached to the actual objects. 
In some cases it would be good if the site would have a database containing the descriptions of the common stuff such as company logos etc. 
So that user's don't have to write them time after time. 
If the alternate descriptions were attached to the object, it could function as a default that can be then be changed by authors in different contexts. 
For instance,? 
image with a globe has description "An iconized globe showing Americas" and when it is used as a icon to global environmental issues the author changes it with ALT text to "Global environmental issues." 
Marja I don't think that ALT=" " should automatically generated. 
Lets say the author fails to put in ALT text.? In lynx, ALT=" " makes the omission invisible.? At least, if there is no ALT attribute, the lynx user is warned that something is missing. 
If the author deliberately wants to put in ALT=" " to signify that the image is purely decorative or redundant, that's ok.? But it should not be automatic. 
Len I've made a couple of suggestions for? 
inclusion in the authoring tool guidelines as we discussed in the recent? 
conference call. 
Please let me know if you have any comments.? HTML tools should NOT generate 'placeholder' ALT? text but should leave the Alt text blank (ALT="") or not generate the? 
Alt attribute. 
Placeholder text could be generated by the tool to let the user? 
know that some text should be added. 
Examples of this include "Alt text? 
here" or "Place Alt text here". 
If placeholder text is generated? 
then accessibility checking tools will only see that there is Alt text and? 
assume the element is accessible. 
This should be a priority 1 item.? HTML tools should generate? 
default Alt text with caution. 
If default text is generated? 
then the user must be offered the option of changing the text. 
Priority? 
2?? 
Chris Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA Yes. 
Briefly: PNG has such a capability (embed metadata in the image file). 
RDF is in general viewed as how we would standardize the data dictionary and/or information model for the information to be bound in in that way. 
There have been proposals for filename conventions to put metadata in parallel files but I think that is not reliable enough. 
Host capabilities to annotate persistent objects will vary among hosts. 
That is why to create an abstract information model and let author tools and servers query the persistent metadata via physical methods that are localized to the host. 
Consider the metadata capabilities of Hierarchical Storage Management products. 
Yes it would be better. 
The author tools do some of this in a limited way already with tool-peculiar databases of ALT/image pairs, all uses of a common URI-reference, etc. 
But the full systematization is in the future and we need an approach to defining information coverage requirements that is not dependent on the developers choice of persistent data technology.

Priority_ 2?_ Chris Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA Hello PNG and to my knowledge GIF as well can store comments/descriptions. 
Anyone has/knows of a simple library to extract/store this into PNG/GIF? 
A link or doc would be appreciated for my project. 
Al, what is RDF? 
I would like to remind http://www.w3.org/WAI/altserv.htm which presents ONE idea of how a central storage for image descriptions could look like. 
So that user's don't have to write them time after time. 
Marja, the tool/project I am working on (specification to be published for discussion here soon) will have this possibility; a simple side-wide ALT database, basically just a textfile with mapping IMG-SRC to ALT, and the ability to put the given ALT automatically into all IMG occurences of your site, for you as an HTML author.
