This question is for Tim Lacy: For applications that embed the IE browser within them, is it possible to: First get the associated box in pixel coordinates for a DOM elemnent (bounding rectangle in screen coordinates)? 
Second two simulate the mouse event to perform a mouse click within that rectangle?

"If they'd just quit shooting the pellet guns at me, I might be able to catch the occasional cannonball as it went whistling overhead..." :-) No reference to your question, just a way of addressing the 216 unread emails I am wading through. 
1) I know you can get the left/top/width/height from MSAA as the Location. 
I'd assume you can also get this data from the DOM, but you'd have to hunt around in the docs - I haven't found it yet, and our resident expert is in Ireland for the next couple of weeks. 
There may be other ways to do this - for example, if you walk the DOM, we now provide a QI to get to the associated MSAA node from the DOM node, and vice versa. 
2) You can call the IHTMLDocument4::fireEvent method on an object in the DOM. 
You can look up the details at http://www.msdn.microsoft.com 
So if I read this correctly, you could walk the DOM, QI it's MSAA node, and then fire a mouseclick event against it. 
Is this what you're looking for? 
I wonder why you'd need the boundingrect? 
Seems easier to walk the DOM, choose a node, and fire a mouseclick directly to it... -T Tim Lacy Accessibility Program Manager Accessibility &amp; Disabilities Group This question is for Tim Lacy: For applications that embed the IE browser within them, is it possible to: First get the associated box in pixel coordinates for a DOM elemnent (bounding rectangle in screen coordinates)?

I believe this shows implementability as long as we can also do this for onmouseover and onclick.
