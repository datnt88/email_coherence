Issue 1: When a user stops a transmission, the CGI's generated do not get killed. 
Am I correct to say that this is so because the HTTP protocol does not contemplate an "transmission interrupted" signal? 
Is there any knoen solution known to this problem that does not involve changes to the protocol? 
Issue 2: Local data shows that our connetions will be swamped by the end of the year. 
Caching seems to be a good way to handle this problem. 
However, most of the caching schemes in use right now are client side. 
In fact, some forms of traffic can only be efficiently cached by server inititiated and managed caches (see Push-Caching Alex Alex Lopez-Ortiz alexlo@opentext.com

That is, they don't write anything until the whole thing has been read. 
I suppose this is to provide an accurate Content-Length. 
Duane W. Your CGI program ought to get a SIGPIPE signal when the server instance goes away, which will happen when the TCP connection goes away. 
First off, thanks to all who replied. 
SIGPIPE works. 
Are there any other situations (with persitent connections and the like) in which we might need to explicitly inform the server of the interruption? 
Would that be just a waste of bandwith? 
Comment? 
Opinions?

Research &amp; Development Open Text Corporation I'm rather new at this, but what does the Connection field do? 
What is the purpose of the "Keep alive" statement that Netscape 2.0 send to servers along with the URL. 
Your input is appreciated.
