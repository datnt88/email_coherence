Enrico, You are right. 
There was still a problem with annotating within a pre . 
It's fixed in the CVS base now. 
Thanks for reporting the problem. 
Vincent. 
Hi Jose, today I downloaded Amaya (and libwww as described in [1]) from W3C CVS repository and compiled it on my NT machine but it seems that the problem of annotating pre .... /pre is still there... Can you please try to annotate a selection in I successfully POSTed the annotation (I can check this w/ Views-- Show Links) but no 'pencil icon appears on the page...and this happens the since the beginning of new 'Annotations-- Annotate selection' Issuing 'Annotations-- Move to stored XPointer' prints the following message" Cannot find where to move the annotation It seems like pre tags mess up the XPointer alogorithm... 
Instead, it does work for a 'document annotation'. 
Hope it helps Enrico [1] http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html 
Hi Jose, 
Ciao Enrico! 
Thanks for your bug report. 
It was a bug, and I fixed it some time ago, almost after the last Amaya release. 
I am happy to know that it is an already fixed bug. 
It's commited on CVS (there is a link on the Amaya home page pointing to the CVS changes since the last 
release). 
Sorry I didn't know about it...next time I'll check it before posting a problem report. 
Are you working with the CVS version or the latest release one? 
I am using the latest release...mainly because I am behind a firewall and I should httptunnel in order to checkout the sources. 
Then I have no compiler on WinNT, which is the target machine where I am planning to use Amaya in my group. 
Are you planning to provide a 'stable build' sometime before the next release? 
Or when is next release planned (looking at releases history it seems that there is a new release every couple of months :-)? 
Anyway my compliments for the great job you all did with Amaya! 
Bye Enrico 
Hi Vincent, 
I updated the latest cvs version of Amaya (and libwww) and recompiled it in order to have a working annotation in pre /pre blocks. 
The good news is that it works, the bad one is that when I annotate the whole doc I'll loose the whole page content: nothing is shown apart from the pencil icon in the top left coner. 
Furthermore if you load the annotations (for a page with pre /pre , i.e. http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/startapp.cc.html) and you have one for the whole doc, then nothing is shown in your doc. 
Hope it helps Enrico 
Hello Enrico, Sorry for not having answered you before. 
We made some changes which may have solved this problem. 
I was unable to reproduce your bug, so I hope it was fixed. 
You can get the fix from CVS or wait for the forthcoming 6.1 release. 
Keep us update! 
Thanks, -jose
