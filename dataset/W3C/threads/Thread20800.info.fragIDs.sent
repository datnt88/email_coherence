<s> Enrico, You are right.  </s>
<s> There was still a problem with annotating within a pre .  </s>
<s> It's fixed in the CVS base now.  </s>
<s> Thanks for reporting the problem.  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
<s> Hi Jose, today I downloaded Amaya (and libwww as described in [1]) from W3C CVS repository and compiled it on my NT machine but it seems that the problem of annotating pre .... /pre is still there... Can you please try to annotate a selection in I successfully POSTed the annotation (I can check this w/ Views-- Show Links) but no 'pencil icon appears on the page...and this happens the since the beginning of new 'Annotations-- Annotate selection' Issuing 'Annotations-- Move to stored XPointer' prints the following message" Cannot find where to move the annotation It seems like pre tags mess up the XPointer alogorithm...  </s>
<s> Instead, it does work for a 'document annotation'.  </s>
<s> Hope it helps Enrico [1] http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html  </s>
<s> Hi Jose,  </s>
<s> Ciao Enrico!  </s>
<s> Thanks for your bug report.  </s>
<s> It was a bug, and I fixed it some time ago, almost after the last Amaya release.  </s>
<s> I am happy to know that it is an already fixed bug.  </s>
<s> It's commited on CVS (there is a link on the Amaya home page pointing to the CVS changes since the last  </s>
<s> release).  </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't know about it...next time I'll check it before posting a problem report.  </s>
<s> Are you working with the CVS version or the latest release one?  </s>
<s> I am using the latest release...mainly because I am behind a firewall and I should httptunnel in order to checkout the sources.  </s>
<s> Then I have no compiler on WinNT, which is the target machine where I am planning to use Amaya in my group.  </s>
<s> Are you planning to provide a 'stable build' sometime before the next release?  </s>
<s> Or when is next release planned (looking at releases history it seems that there is a new release every couple of months :-)?  </s>
<s> Anyway my compliments for the great job you all did with Amaya!  </s>
<s> Bye Enrico  </s>
<s> Hi Vincent,  </s>
<s> I updated the latest cvs version of Amaya (and libwww) and recompiled it in order to have a working annotation in pre /pre blocks.  </s>
<s> The good news is that it works, the bad one is that when I annotate the whole doc I'll loose the whole page content: nothing is shown apart from the pencil icon in the top left coner.  </s>
<s> Furthermore if you load the annotations (for a page with pre /pre , i.e. http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/startapp.cc.html) and you have one for the whole doc, then nothing is shown in your doc.  </s>
<s> Hope it helps Enrico  </s>
<s> Hello Enrico, Sorry for not having answered you before.  </s>
<s> We made some changes which may have solved this problem.  </s>
<s> I was unable to reproduce your bug, so I hope it was fixed.  </s>
<s> You can get the fix from CVS or wait for the forthcoming 6.1 release.  </s>
<s> Keep us update!  </s>
<s> Thanks, -jose  </s>
