Hi everyone, Back in 2000 or so, I was employed by a company called Edapta that worked on creating technologies that enabled Web sites to adapt themselves to the user interface needs of their users, including people with various disabilities. 
This was innovative and cool stuff. 
Nobody wanted to fund Edapta, though, and we soon went out of business, almost. 
(I went without paycheck for three consecutive months.) 
Finally, we were bought by a Belgian company called Reef, who had a content management system. 
Reef paid lip service to the concept of accessibility but did nothing to actively develop the Edapta software beyond a half-hearted attempt to integrate it in to their poorly done CMS. 
(E.g., in Reef's CMS, there was no field for alt text on images; you had to fake it by setting the height attribute to something like '130" alt="Site Map"'. 
I feel pretty justified in pointing out that from an accessibility standpoint, Reef's software was a nightmare.) Due to various problems, ranging from lack of vision to lack of technical leadership to failure to pay employees, Reef imploded. 
I got fired just before the implosion, because I dared to question Reef's refusal to pay employees the portions of our salary which had been earned, so I wasn't there at the very end, but from what I've heard, it wasn't pretty. 
With the spectacular failure of Reef, Edapta effectively died a second time, although there were factions in Reef who were vehemently opposed to any accessibility-related activities in the company apart from ill-conceived attempts to sell software capabilities which did not yet exist (and which the company had no plans to create) -- so really, Reef's demise was simply the final bullet in the Edapta project. 
Edapta's technologies were built on open standards, such as XML, XSLT, CC/PP, and other commonly used Internet technologies which have become more ubiquitous in the three years since 2000. 
Server support for transformational user interfaces has increased dramatically, and there are many more tools available which can address the needs of users for not only an "accessible" interface but a "usable" one as well -- one which is tailored specifically for each visitor according to her preferences or requirements. 
I am interested in finding people who would be willing to work on an open source "edapta" server project -- in other words, putting together the available tools (Apache, XSLT, etc.) to develop a free package which can be installed on Web sites to enable content delivery transformations. 
There are already projects underway at 
large companies to do similar work, but the price makes them unacceptable options for small Web sites. 
Accessibility should not be a luxury, and for that reason, I think it's important to have free alternatives which can increase the utility for sites for people with disabilities. 
If you are interested in such a project, please email me to let me know, at kynn@idyllmtn.com -- or if you are going to be at the CSUN conference later this month, please look for me there . 
I have a presentation on the future of Web accessibility on Thursday afternoon, and I would love to talk to people afterwards, or any other time at CSUN. --Kynn PS: If you're aware of anyone looking for a Web accessibility dude, I'm still looking for a regular job.

Sounds similar to Nick Kew's mod_accessibility: which runs as a module under Apache 2.0. 
But which is not Open Source. 
I believe that IBM's effort in this area with WBI is available as an open source project in their alphaworks area but is no longer under development by IBM (this is from talking to an IBM engineer, Rich Schwerdtfeger, who used to work on it - I don't currently have links available).

Indeed, I certainly meant to reply to Kynn's post, but round tuits have been in woefully short supply. 
Kynn - I didn't see a URL in your post. 
If there isn't any relevant material available on the Web, perhaps you could say a few words on how this might relate to mod_accessibility. 
I could be interested!

is this the one? 
"The (unofficial) WBI Story" "WBI Development Kit for Java is a programmable HTTP proxy for developing and running intermediary applications on the Web. 
This programming platform can be used to implement all manner, from single functions to complex image- and page-editing and distributed applications. 
It is a full Java implementation of WBI and provides a convenient and flexible API".
