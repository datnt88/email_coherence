<s> for a variant on that idea: I think of XML schemas as a C struct, or a Java class -- there's centralized control and no extensibility mechanism.  </s>
<s> The plus side is it's simple for applications.  </s>
<s> My main reason for suggesting RSS is better reformulated in RDF is precisely that there are no limits what can go in.  </s>
<s> In programming language terms, RDF is a Perl hash or a Java Hashtable.  </s>
<s> The processing application is responsible for figuring out which bits it wants and which it doesn't -- a little more complicated than the schema situation.  </s>
<s> ...by "lobby for", I mean: help design, if doing so makes sense.  </s>
<s> For a taster of what a Java RDF API can look like (the graph stuff not query) you might find Jena interesting.  </s>
<s> See: ...or a recent xml.com article: Dunno if that'll leave you cold or not; guess it depends what your mental model of the SOAP pt5 structure is.  </s>
<s> If you're thinking of pouring it all into a hash-of-hashes, I suspect RDF might even prove useful.  </s>
