Dear Martin I have finished translation of XML 1.0 (second) edition into Russian: Best regards, Radik Usmanov Hello Radik, Many thanks for your work. 
Please add some comment at the top of the document according to the Copyright FAQ Please integrate the sentence just before 'this version' (where you say that you are the translator) into this comment, and use a different background. 
Please make sure that Appendix J has a different background, to make clear that it's something you added (very good idea to have a glossary). 
Regards, Martin.
