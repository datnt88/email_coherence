Please review the notes for a presentation given at SUNY/CUAD 2000 by Kynn Bartlett at: http://www.idyllmtn.com/papers/suny2000/notes.html 
Each discussion is broken into the following 4 sections: What It Means: A plain description of the checkpoint, and why it matters. 
The Tricky Part: "Gotchas" or things that aren't obvious. 
If WCAG were easy to understand, you wouldn't need me to help you! 
How To Check: Practical information on how you can tell if your page passes muster. 
In most of these, I refer to specific techniques or software in boldface; these are listed in the appendix at the back with download and reference links. 
Sample Code: Examples of HTML highlighting the specific accommodations necessary to maintain accessibility.

Thanks for the link Wendy, and the hard work Kynn. 
A greyscale image of a train map will have far more impact on the audience, and a link there to an example would have been great. 
(Q.E.D.) A b+w photocopy of the London tube map at a very large scale (~3 stations per screen) appears to reproduce color as texture, though one needs good sight to perceive this currently. 
I have had a complaint that my contributions are repetitive and unhelpful, so I'll not comment further, other than to say that the attempt to use plain English, and the 4 sections are a great model.
