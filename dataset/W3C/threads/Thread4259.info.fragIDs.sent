<s> The WG discussed this and decided that it was enough to have a instance-of function and that a type accessor was not needed.  </s>

<s> That's rather unfortunate.  </s>
<s> It is very limiting when constructing reusable components to encounter systems which do not allow for the nature/type of an element/variable/data memeber to be variant.  </s>
<s> This invariably ends up being a short-sighted attitude.  </s>

<s> One way of solving this would be to create a universal naming schema for all types that can occur, but this was deemed too complex for XPath and XQuery 1.0.  </s>

<s> Ashok, As you know, I've been a proponent of NUNs since before they existed, and I hope we do come up with a universal naming scheme that is as simple as possible.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, once that naming scheme exists, xf:type makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't make sense before that time.  </s>
<s> And this is something the W3C XML Schema WG should do, not XML Query.  </s>
