Here is a variation on the "Only the Author can supply" approach proposed by Wendy. 
OTACS - 2 (Only the Author Can Supply) The minimum set for compliance (equiv to single A rating today) would be composed of those items which cannot be derived or deduced by a tool or the reader with a disability and must therefore be supplied by the author. 
NOTES: 
1- By deduced by a tool, we mean deduced by a tool commonly available at low or no cost to the person with a disability. 
2- Information that can be deduced by user or generated by a tool would not be in the minimum set. 
3- What can be deduced by tools will change over time. 
The guidelines would be modified over time to accommodate and reflect these changes. 
4 -We do not have a good way to handle the advances that occur after the guidelines are released and before the next revision. 
This looks like "until user agent" type problem. 
(Someone suggested that we put these into a special Minimum Plus category which indicates that you must do these today but that they may not be needed in the future). 
(Graham suggested that there were some things that might be added to minimum over time as they became practical or functional.) 5- This basically only requires authors to provide the minimum that they must because someone or something else cannot provide it. 
6- We might have one or more levels above.

Add another note: This also assumes that the author is using a markup 
language which supports the information provided. 
This is problematic because there is a great deal of accessibility-related information which only the author can provide -- but which cannot be encapsulated into HTML effectively. 
The addition of author-created XHTML modules makes things even more questionable, of course.

If a tool can solve this, then it becomes an Authoring Tool or a User Agent issue, not a Web Content issue. 
If a tool can correctly process the information then such a tool can be run on the user's side, and it is not the author's responsibility. 
Therefore, there should be absolutely no WCAG 2 checkpoints/guidelines which are not "minimum set" via OTACS-2. 
Is this correct? 
Do you agree or disagree? 
My take on web accessibility is that ultimately the question of accessibility boils down to: (a) Knowing what information you need to provide (as an author), and (b) Knowing how to properly encode that information so it can be utilized by the end user. 
I maintain that the set of all checkpoints which fit this definition -- and which fit OTACS-2 -- is equal to the set of all checkpoints which belong in WCAG 2. There are no checkpoints which do not meet OTACS-2, which should nevertheless be included in WCAG 2. Therefore, this is a poor choice for distinguishing a "minimum set" of WCAG 2 checkpoints.
