Does disabilities act apply to cyberspace? 
By Patrick Thibodeau 02/09/2000 WASHINGTON ? 
A U.S. House of Representatives committee heard conflicting arguments today over whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to virtual space in much the same way it 
now applies to physical spaces. 
The U.S. Department of Justice believes the ADA, a law that prohibits discrimination against people with 
disabilities, does apply to Web sites, and the federal government is expected to issue accessibility requirements directed at federal departments and 
agencies by March. 
Federal Web site operators will have to make a number of changes to comply with these regulations, such as including streaming audio or audio files to accompany 
text. 
The rules may also require captioning for video 
and restrict the use of color to display information. 
Web 
sites will also have to provide formats that are compatible with braille- and speech-synthesis devices. 
Other provisions may ban touch screens and prohibit moving text and animation unless there are no alternatives. 
U.S. Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Constitution Subcommittee, said the federal effort "can help serve to educate both the public and private sectors (about) how greater handicapped accessibility of the Web can be achieved with relatively low-cost solutions." 
But legal experts testifying before the committee were divided on whether the ADA will apply to Web sites. 
The matter is already in court. 
Last fall, the National Federation of the Blind filed a class-action lawsuit against America Online Inc., charging that the company's service violated the accessibility law (see story). 
"What we need is achievable; what we are asking for is reasonable," said Gary Wunder, a programmer/analyst at the University of Missouri and a board member of the National Federation of the Blind. 
Wunder described his own work-related efforts to use software that isn't adapted to needs of the blind. 
For instance, some key project-management software uses color codes to identify critical projects, making it difficult for him to use the software, he said. 
"I took a demotion from manager to programmer because of this kind of software," he said. 
Judy Brewer, director of the Web Accessibility Initiative at the World Wide Web Consortium, told the committee that ADA compliance costs are negligible and that "much of Web accessibility is a matter of good design." 
But Dennis Hayes, the creator of the Hayes modem and now chairman of the U.S. Internet Industry Association, urged the committee to focus on voluntary efforts through standards bodies, rather than on regulation. 
"It will take years to work out in courts how the ADA will apply," said Hayes. "In those same years, the standards can proceed much more rapidly." 
Moreover, Hayes said webmasters lack the experience and tools to create Web sites that meet the needs of the disabled. 
The legal issues remain to be sorted out. 
Elizabeth Dorminey, an attorney at Wimberly, Lawson Steckel Nelson &amp; Schneider PC in Athens, Ga., said the ADA applies to private entities that provide "public accommodations" -- a term that doesn't include the Internet, Internet service providers or private Web sites.

Audio files to accompany text? 
Lies, lies, lies. 
Yes. 
Lies, lies, lies. 
Color is -not- restricted for displaying information; color is only restricted as the -only- means of conveying information. 
That is to say, "text format." 
Huh? Ban touch screens? 
At least I know there is a market for my course. 
BTW, the next class starts Monday: Sign up while you still can! 
Yeah, don't be silly, web sites aren't for the public! 
It's 
not like e-commerce sites are CONTINUALLY spoken about as "in competition with brick-and-mortar" stores! 
Clearly, brick-and- mortar stores are for those handicapped people, while the web is only for us "fully functional" folks. 
Excuse me. 
I need to spit rudely.

This article repeats a common myth that the use o colour will be restricted by accesibility requirements. 
This is "more or less bunk", basedas far as I can tell on a failure to understand a very simple sentence in a W3C recommendation: "Do not use colour alone to convey information". 
Note the use of the word "Alone" in that sentence. 
I am not sure where theideaof including audio to accompnay text came from either - this seems like a possible, but in many cases extremely inefficient solution. 
(Although I have seen it used on a number of sites with no particular concern for accessibility, so I guess some people think it is a reasonable thing to do). 
Does anyone have a source contact to try and point out these basic (and important) erros in this article?

I just called Patrick and will be talking to him tomorrow morning -- it's late for him, and he works at home, so we should probably avoid flooding his home phone number with calls!

aloha, charles! 
you observed: quote This article repeats a common myth that the use o colour will be restricted by accesibility requirements. 
This is "more or less bunk", based as far as I can tell on a failure to understand a very simple sentence in a W3C recommendation: "Do not use colour alone to convey information". 
Note the use of the word "Alone" in that sentence. 
unquote it is the product of accepting on faith that something is proscribed simply because someone told you that it is... in journalistic circles there once existed a quaint custom called checking one's facts, which has, apparently, died out... sloppy reporting isn't anything new, but the failure of the technological press to understand the true issues is pretty damn depressing... one would think that, especially in a technological setting, checking one's facts would be as fundamental as validating pages before exposing them to the world, but, then... oh, well, gregory

Hi, Perhaps it's an indication that there needs be an additional phrase or sentence to emphasize the intent. 
I often use examples to be sure that the meaning is getting through.

I shouldn't say this without looking more carefully. 
But many of the WAI 
guidelines documents point into the techniques documents for examples. 
This is fine when the information is read on a web browser, as I think it should be. 
But more often than we would like, people print pages to paper and take them away from their computers, and they don't get the whole message because they didn't print it all out.
