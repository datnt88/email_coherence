Hi folks-- I've been following some of the media accounts of Microsoft's new "Smart Tags" feature in Windows XP's IE 6. [In short, Smart Tags allows Microsoft to display different-looking links to MS-chosen resources around specific words, when enabled -- basically, it's a crude third-party metadata system.] 
There has been a lot of backlash against this idea in the media, including from the Wall Street Journal and others. 
While some of this is merely that people tend to dislike ANYTHING Microsoft does, a lot of the sentiments seem to be actually directed at the concept of third-party metadata annotations and links. 
A lot of people -- primarily web designers or web content authors -- seem to be incensed over the idea that a third party could provide information "on a page" (as displayed by a user agent) which was not placed there by the original author. 
To those people, Annotea is just as evil and wrong as Smart Tags. 
Anyone have any thoughts on this, and what effects this type of reaction will have upon the eventual widespread adoption of the Semantic Web? 
Is the developer backlash against Smart Tags a sign that the SW may never be accepted? 
Discuss.

TAKE CONTROL. 
Kynn, Annotea and other annotation systems are not specifically tailored to Web authors and designers but to people who read the pages. 
And I don't see how Web designers and authors could prevent us (the readers) to use such systems. 
In the paper world, the problem is less of importance, since only ONE reader usually "destroys" the layout of the author by highlighting and marking the pages. 
In the electronic word, you can get the marks left by other readers even before you start your own annotations. 
This can become a problem, greatly examplified by ThirdVoice (cluttered annotations on Web pages). 
I believe annotation tools will be used, but readers might want to filter annotations (like using specific annotation servers: your classroom, your university, your company, your research group...).

[Author of the Yawas Web annotation system. 
By the way, try www.yawas.com: 
I'm not hosting this web site, but fans of Maria Carey might like it ;) ] I've been following some discussions about Smart Tags and I see two general types of objections: Some people think that any kind of "mediation" of their content is wrong and thus oppose all annotation (and many other aspects of the Semantic Web). 
(BTW, I don't think it's accurate to say that annotation can't be prevented. 
Annotation software developers can only fight off so many lawsuits before they go bankrupt.) Some people dislike the fact that the default Smart Tags database was pointing only to Microsoft sites, but they don't object to annotation as long as it isn't being used to prop up a monopoly. 
Wesley Felter - wesley@felter.org - http://felter.org/wesley/ Huh? 
Have their been any annotation lawsuits? 
By whom, over what? 
I still think that the "grafitti" complaint is spurrious, aside from the cases where offensive or libelous content is annotated on. 
The courts, at least in the U.S., just don't allow a technology to be killed. 
If the technology has some social value, some vendors work with the gov to meet the guidelines established for its use.

The "smart tags" furor has been interesting -- with many people seemingly opposed just because it's Microsoft. 
I'd argue that there is no copyright claim against a website annotator (either the technology or the person who adds and views notes). 
Although some copyright maximalists would disagree, I'd argue that a reader has the right to combine two sources of information in his web browser just as he could write notes in a book's margins. 
Annotation is akin to viewing the work under different lighting, not creating a derivative work. 
If Microsoft is sloppy enough or too overbearing, there might be an unfair competition claim, but that would depend more on the business practices than the technology. 
If anyone knows of any lawsuits or threat letters, I'd be very interested to hear about them. 
I might have better luck applying my legal than programming skills. 
I wish I could be so sanguine! 
The Second and Ninth Circuits (DeCSS and Napster) seem well on their way to declaring that certain technologies have no social value, or are illegal notwithstanding possible valuable uses. 
Litigation can be very expensive, and many developers seem to settle rather than pushing their claims through the courts, so the bargaining is usually between the "upstart innovator / pirate" and the established industry, not with the government. 
--Wendy Wendy Seltzer -- wendy@seltzer.com Fellow, Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School I think the fear is that companies (especially microsoft which heads the browser business now) could hurt any competition that was out there. 
AKA. 
If microsoft doesn't want you to see it, you don't. 
Now, yes, if Microsoft didn't want you to go to competitors websites, they could add that into the MSIE code, but I think that people fear this is a more covert way of doing it. 
If the feature is as annoying as say, the MS paperclip, it could be even worse.... 
For example, MSNBC could steal alot of CNN's views because an annotation says to check out MSNBC's site instead. 
Also, if I type in www.priceline.com, and I REALLY want to go to priceline, do I want to be asked, do you want to try microsoft's expedia? 
when it's going there. 
I wonder how much control Microsoft will have over recording what websites you go to also (how centralized this feature is)s. 
What kind of profiling might be created? 
It's kinda creepy when you think about it. 
anyway, post your feedback at me, don't flame... * TRAICOVN ----------------------------------- http://www.traicovn.com 
* I agree, these are for different groups of readers helping them to make comments on things that they read and helping them to communicate with other readers. 
Here is a sample scenario for Annotea readers, that hopefully explains some of the usage possibilities and how they relate to the fears of annotation technology. 
From my viewpoint the scenarios for Smart Tag technology are quite different. 
Set of readers may belong to a group A making standards. 
They create a new version of a standard X and start publishing their comments on that version as Annotea annotations on their annotation server. 
Group A has couple of dedicated editors who have write access, with annotation technology they can use the annotations made by others without giving everybody write access. 
Also the editors don't need to go through mail archives and try to attach the comments to right parts of the document. 
They can read the document and see comments right on the chapters or words that they are concentrating on their current editing efforts. 
So here annotations provide an easy user interface and I don't see why we should make the editing of the document harder by not allowing users to use the technology. 
This group also has a social process that freezes documents when new versions are published so they don't even have the problem of orphan annotations. 
Another group B also creates comments as annotations for the public version of the stardard X document somewhere on the Web. 
Now the group A has an option to ignore them by not reading their annotations from group B's annotation server, by specifically subcribing to the server to read them because they feel these annotations are good and help them in their job, or reading them but using filtering and various icons so that they know which annotations are made by group A and which annotations by group B. A bit later, someone who is angry with the editor from group A starts sending nasty annotations about the standard X to a special graffiti server that let's any users to annotate anything. 
Earlier this same user would have sent the nasty comments to some public discussion list, now they are nasty annotations. 
In both cases the reader can try to ignore them by not subscribing the mailing list or the graffiti server at all or subscribing it and using strong filtering with some users who send comments to the server or the mail list. 
So there are social processes involved also with this technology. 
Most of the readers of the standard X don't subscribe to the specific annotation servers mentioned above, they just look the document as is or may use their company local annotation servers where they discuss how the standard could be used in the context of their company. 
Marja I think it's going to happen. 
Check out these posts for a sample of how the winds are blowing (I've seen half a dozen similar ones): Wesley Felter - wesley@felter.org - http://felter.org/wesley/ Winds are blowing? 
I would say hot air is blowing. 
Who would sue? 
On that very same discussion group, a more cogent argument is presented which just strips down the anti-SmartTag sentiment to anti-Micrsoft. 
I can't explain why the SayNoToThirdVoice group still has the problem with graffiti. 
This makes some claim about "unauthorized derivative work". 
Anyway, we can blow all the steam we want about what the legal ramifications are. 
Wendy, and other lawyers, a general question: do academic law programs (such as Berkman Center) do any research preperation in anticipation of legal conflicts? 
I remember that Jonathan Zittrain at Berkman had quite supportive of annotation when ThirdVoice came out with the software and starting getting flack. 
I have some interesting work that I hinted about before regarding server-side annotation/collaboration. 
I will definitely have more to present in a few weeks-- I can only hint for so long! 
Given the choice between publisher-managed and third-party-managed annotation, I'm betting that most publishers would choose the former.
