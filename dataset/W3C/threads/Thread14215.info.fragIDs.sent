<s> Hi, I'm hoping to do a thorough review of this document later this week (I've had it on my todo list since last June, and now that  </s>
<s> the document is in Last Call I guess it's now or never.) For now, I just have a quick comment on section 2.4, "Lists":  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint 5.2] Encode list structure and list items properly.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] The HTML list elements DL, UL, and OL (available in  </s>
<s> HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0) should only be used to create lists, not for formatting effects such as indentation.  </s>
<s> When possible, use ordered (numbered) lists to help navigation.  </s>
<s> and the example it gives is: Example.  </s>
<s> Instead of nesting bulleted lists like this: * writing tools + pens o highlighters # red # green # blue o ball-point # green # purple # mauve + pencils o soft lead o #2 lead * erasers Use ordered lists (or make sure to put distinguishing information at the beginning of each list item): 1. writing tools 1. pens 1. highlighters 1. red 2. green 3. blue 2. ball-point 1. green 2. purple 3. mauve 1. pencils 1. soft lead 2. #2 lead 2. erasers  </s>
<s> But this doesn't seem like a good example of an ordered list at all -- the items in these lists don't have a particular order to them (green, purple, and mauve aren't in that order for any particular reason.)  </s>
<s> I suggest that this example be changed to use list items that really ought to be ordered.  </s>
<s> (like giving instructions on how to do something.)  </s>

<s> Hi Gerald, Thanks for the comment!  </s>
<s> Note for the record that the Techniques document is not in last call, only the guidelines document [1] is.  </s>

<s> There is more to this guideline than this exchange reveals.  </s>
<s> I was shocked when I first encountered this guideline, because the fact that lists give the appearance of order to things that are semantically sets is one of my hot buttons.  </s>
<s> But there is a reason for it.  </s>
<s> And it goes beyond just those cases that are natural OL applications.  </s>
<s> Numbering of list items is a navigation aid for someone using a screen reader, which really treats the document as a sequence of lines.  </s>
<s> Braille formatting uses hierarchical numbering of sections and not indenting to show structure for a similar reason.  </s>
<s> So the guidelines need to expose this issue.  </s>
<s> There is benefit to ordinal marking of lists for navigation for this group.  </s>
<s> This is not a pure win-win deal; so the practice has to be applied with a grain of salt.  </s>
<s> But there is some motivation to use OL over  </s>
<s> UL even when the underlying semantics indicate UL.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, this particular example is so dysfunctional that we had better come up with a better one if we want to pass the laugh test.  </s>

<s> Proposed technique example to clear this up.  </s>
<s> (I had to think for a while before I remembered why it was there too...) When using lists, if the list is ordered and the size stated explicitly it will provide extra orientation to many users, in particular people relying on screen readers, single line braille displays, and very large magnification screens, even when there is no inherent ordering in the content.  </s>
<s> For example: We use staiontery of 3 types, each of which is divided into several subcatergories:  </s>
<s> 1. Paper - 4 type 1. Envelopes 2. Notepaper 3. Letterhead 4. Poster paper  </s>
<s> 2. Pens - 2 types 1. Blue writing pens 2. whiteboard pens 3. fasteners - 3 types 1. paper clips 2. staples 3. Big lengths of rope.  </s>
<s> Provides more clues to navigation and to the implicit structure of the list than if unordered lists were used.  </s>

<s> I heartily agree.  </s>
<s> As I pointed out earlier the lists are a bit problematic The extra list information could be better given by the browser, in which case it can be turned on and off when needed.  </s>
<s> And especially with long lists, we could provide the user context information about the hierarchy levels and navigation support on different levels when needed, such as with tables.  </s>
<s> Another thing is if you need to refer to some specific list item from the text.  </s>
<s> In some cases, we might need numbers to differentiate between the items.  </s>
<s> However, the sample list does not do even this very well.  </s>
<s> If I'm in the middle of the list below with a small screen how do I know which is item 3.2 and if I make a note of item 2. staples because that is what I  </s>

<s> Maybe the text referencing the list item could give enough context that  </s>
<s> there is no need to go back to the list.  </s>
<s> And if there is a need to check the context of a list item, links might be used to provide the information.  </s>

<s> Hello, Here's a proposal: 1) We say something like this: Non-visual users often "get lost" in lists, especially those with several layers of embedding and those that do not indicate the specific level of indentation for each item.  </s>
<s> Content developers are  </s>
<s> encouraged to use UL for unordered lists and OL for ordered lists  </s>
<s> (i.e., use markup appropriately).  </s>
<s> However, until user agents provide a means to identify list context clearly (e.g., by supporting the ':before' pseudo-element in CSS2), content developers should consider including contextual clues in their lists.  </s>
<s> 2) We talk about a CSS2 solution: The following CSS2 style sheet shows how to provide compound numbers  </s>
<s> for nested lists created with either UL or OL elements.  </s>
<s> Items are numbered as "1", "1.1", "1.1.1", etc. UL, OL { counter-reset: item } LI { display: block } LI:before { content: counters(item, "."); counter-increment:  </s>
<s> item }  </s>
<s> 3) We talk about a CSS1 solution:  </s>
<s> Until either CSS2 is widely supported by users agents or user agents allow users to control rendering of lists through other  </s>
<s> means, authors should consider providing contextual clues in nested lists.  </s>
<s> The following CSS1 mechanism shows how to hide the end of a list when style sheets are turned on, and to reveal it when style sheets are turned off, when user style sheets override the hiding mechanism, or when style sheets aren't supported.  </s>
<s> .endoflist { display: none } LI Paper: LI Envelopes LI Notepaper LI Letterhead LI Poster paper LI Pens: LI Blue writing pens LI whiteboard pens LI Fasteners: LI paper clips LI staples LI Big lengths of rope.  </s>
<s> /UL span class="endoflist" (End of Office Supplies) /span Note: This example does not help the case of wrapping list items.  </s>
<s> With some more effort, the author could put similar markup at the end of each list  </s>
<s> item. Question: Perhaps it's also helpful to use this mechanism at the beginning of each list to say how many items are in the list.  </s>
