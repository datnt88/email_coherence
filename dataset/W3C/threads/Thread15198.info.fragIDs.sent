<s> Hi Lisa, i think is important to have a valid HTML/XHTML code for level 1 because, as experience in our webprofessional association, a web professional MUST create standard code for web sites.  </s>
<s> This is a requrement that we ask to all our member and this will be a must for the respect of WCAG 2.0, due the mission of W3C.  </s>
<s> Also, i think that we need also to create a section in guidelines about the "abuse" of the WAI Level 1,2,3 Claim... We need to set the possibility to check and ask for logo removal for web sites that declares accessibility level that is not reached because this could cause problems of "emulation".  </s>

<s> Are requiring that all HTML passes the HTML validate for minimal conformance or level two?  </s>
<s> Yes, definitely, and no I wouldn't classify validity errors.  </s>
<s> The document is either valid, or it is not.  </s>
<s> As an illustration of the problem, Emacspeak supports the pre-processing of web pages by an XSLT transform to improve accessibility.  </s>
<s> The more invalid the content is, the worse the results are likely to be - often causing the XML/HTML parser to crash.  </s>
<s> Of course, the tool developers could work around the problem, but obviously this would involve more work.  </s>
<s> At level 2 I think the requirement should be one of validity.  </s>
<s> Invalid documents also tend to be poorly designed in other respects.  </s>
<s> Of course, given a valid document a tool can make assumptions (based on the DTD or schema) regarding its structure.  </s>
<s> An accessible document should be predictable in this respect so that it can be transformed more easily.  </s>
