What at I'd like, personally, is a means for downloading a selected set of messages to my local computer, to import into my local email program. 
This would be at least an interim solution for accessibility problems, assuming of course that users have accessible email programs, and assuming that the download options includes their file format. 
It would also be a convenience for everyone since it's lots faster to scan email once it's local. 
Features: 1. choice of format for eudora, outlook, etc. (I personally use eudora). 
Note: we may be able to omit formats for programs that import from other programs. 
2. ability to select messages to be downloaded by: a. date range b. subject line c. author Len NOTE: if you copy my email address from this email, please use the "reply to" address, namely kasday@acm.org

Len What if you just had them sent to your email. 
Then one wouldn't need to worry about formatting. 
They would all just show up. 
Say with ARCHIVE: at the front of the subject line to make them easy to sort out on arrival.

actually making the archives available in normal mail foormat is wsomething that thre was solme interest in at the plenary - if that would help then it would be helpful to know that there is more support for it. 
But to me it is important to be able to find things in the archive on the web, and have a URI for them.

Gregg's suggestion would work for me, especially since I could set up a filter to pump them into a folder. 
It would also me easer on the receving end since people wouldn't have to figure out how to import the file. 
Only drawback is that it would be slower than receiving a compressed file. 
Regardless of how we do it, it would be in addition to the web archive so we'd still have urls.
