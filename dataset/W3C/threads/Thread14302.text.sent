The following questions regarding compliance came up in today's ER meeting: A. Compliance with alternative pages: The guideline states 11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page. 
[Priority 1] If this is done, can the inaccessible page be given a compliance logo corresponding to the conformance of the alternative page? 
B. Links between alternative pages and standard pages. 
Question: once you are on an alternative page, should links on that page refer back to the "standard" page or should there be a complete and self contained parallel site. 
There are arguments on either side. 
Some users prefer to stay on the standard site as much as possible. 
On the other hand, it can be tedious to have to keep switching to the alternate page. 
C: Regarding Compliance Scope. 
The guidelines state: Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three icons provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C explanation of the claim. 
Information about the icons and how to insert them in pages is available at [WCAG-ICONS]. 
Questions: 1. 
Is this icon allowed even if the pages itself is accessible but links to inaccessible pages? 
2. It would be useful to define claims that go beyond the scope of the current page. 
We discussed the possibility WCAG defining one or more types of scope, e.g. "everything with a URL given by a given domain name". 
[note added by LRK after the meeting: this wouldn't cover sites which have pages that refer to IP addresses. 
Perhaps we should leave it up to page or site authors to define the scope... we'd just require that some means of defining the scope be defined.]

The conformance claim should indicate the scope of the claim, in this case a combination of two pages. 
(For background, refer to My opinion is that, since alternative pages should be used as little as possible, you should avoid where possible creating an alternative site. 
However, it would make sense that if you have a particular type of page that appears frequently and is always inaccessible alone, you could/should promote easy navigation within that set of pages. 
Please note that the conformance statements in ATAG and UAAG are more general and we're slowly improving conformance provisions since WCAG 1.0 was published. 
Check out, for instance, the UAAG Proposed Rec conformance section: There's still work to be done to show how to use metadata to describe scope, etc. Yes, but the link should be clearly identified. 
I would argue that the icon should not be used if the inaccessible page does not link directly to the accessible page. 
Yes. 
And that's where we need to spend more time working on the metadata (schema?) to use in conformance claims.

Or are you saying, skipping ahead to your other comments, that specification of scope is something still being worked on? 
I get a mite bit worried about asking authors to learn about metadata/schema just to make a conformance claim.
