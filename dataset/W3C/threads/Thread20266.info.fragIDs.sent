<s> This is related to Amaya's "HTTP Redirect bug."  </s>
<s> When submitting a form using the POST method, if Amaya receives a redirect HTTP header, it tries to POST to that URL also.  </s>
<s> In other words, Amaya does the following: HTTP out: POST: url to cgi script HTTP in: redirect to new url - an HTML document HTTP out: POST: url of HTML document The last POST is incorrect.  </s>
<s> Amaya should try a GET for that document:  </s>
<s> HTTP out: POST: url to cgi script HTTP in: redirect to new url - HTML doc HTTP out: GET: url of HTML doc Although I believe that this is related to the "HTTP Redirect bug," I'm not certain that it's the exact same one.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] No it should not.  </s>
<s> Status 301 and 302 redirects are supposed to be issued with the same method as the original request.  </s>
<s> Broken behaviour in some browsers resulted in a lot or content authors who didn't read the specs using 302 to redirect to a confirmation page.  </s>
<s> As such redirects to GET were clearly needed, status 303 was added to cover them, in an early draft of HTTP 1.1 (if you just return Location:, but no Status: in a CGI script, you get a 302 redirect, or an internal redirect).  </s>
<s> Because of the existence of broken browsers, status 307 redirects were added in later drafts of HTTP 1.1.  </s>
<s> This means the same as 302, for conforming browsers, but makes it clear that you don't want the browser to assume that you were expecting broken 302 behaviour.  </s>
<s> If your application requires reliable redirect from POST to GET, it must return a 303 status.  </s>
<s> Because of the misimplementations, using 302 for a POST is unsafe, although you should use it for GET.  </s>

<s> Mail was designed to work with Netscape's misinterpretation of the standard.  </s>
<s> Couldn't Amaya have an option that the user could set to emulate this misbehavior?  </s>
<s> It might be named something like this: "Emulate broken redirects."  </s>
<s> Although the behavior is wrong, it would give users a chance to visit broken websites.  </s>
