I expect that similar normalizers will work on xmlns attributes, with or without blessing of the specification, 
But the heart of the matter is whether normalization happens with the blessing of the specification or not. 
No, the heart of the matter is whether the XML Namespaces specification has the authority to say that normalization is not allowed, which is what the text currently says because it is over-specifying the matter. 
I provided the text 
sigh... trudge thru archives... you clearly know what text you're talking about; is it so much trouble to give me a pointer? 
or at least a date from a mail message? 
I don't see it in mail from you to www-tag this month. 
More clues? 
And this is the second time you've replied to my requests for an example without providing one. 
If your position, to wit... "it is because the namespaces draft cannot declare them to be different because a normalizer has every right (and in some cases a responsibility) to normalize those URIs before the namespace processor even sees them. 
-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Apr/0124.html ... has any merit, then there must be examples. 
I'm starting to doubt it. 
necessary to accomplish the same thing (strcmp comparison of attributes) without subsetting the URI standard and without any need to normatively reference the IRI specification, thus avoiding the fatal mistake of a section 9. ....Roy

Right in that message: 
Therefore, Namespaces shouldn't say that the namespaces (identified) are different, even for a limited purpose. 
What it should say is that the identifier is assumed to be in normal form (because consistency has its own rewards) and that no additional normalization is required prior to comparison (for efficiency reasons), noting that *because* of this decision, inconsistent use of equivalent URIs in the namespace attributes will result in a regrettable, but not fatal, false negative match when they are mixed within the same process. 
Authors are therefore encouraged to be consistent for the sake of efficiency. 
That is all that needs to be said. 
It does not need to say that the identifiers are *different*. 
I provided an example. 
You just didn't accept it. 
That's your problem. 
TimBL provided the other example, which is that URI processors tend to be reused and therefore claiming this thing is a URI but does not adhere to the principles of URIs is the same as declaring a subset of the URI specification.

In what message? 
Oh well, no need for a pointer since you gave me a copy. 
Hmm... OK, that's a coherent position. 
It seems pretty subtle, but it meets all my requirements, I guess. 
Perhaps I wasn't clear: I mean an example of two URIs. 
The actual strings. 
Not an example scenario. 
Let's not go there, OK?
