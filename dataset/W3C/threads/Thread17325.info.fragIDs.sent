Hi, I want to view more info about implementing grouping and bypassing links. 
I write some like this: a href="#firstOption" tabindex="1" Saltear barra de navegacion /a | a href="index.htm" 
class="Menu" title="P?gina 
de Inicio" tabindex="2" accesskey="I" hreflang="es" Inicio /a | a href="Contacto.htm" 
class="Menu" title="Acceso a la P?gina de Contacto" tabindex="3" accesskey="C" hreflang="es" Contacto /a | But, i don?t figure how this help. 
Thank in advance

Everything looks right except for the map tags. 
Those shouldn't be 
there. 
Try looking up unordered lists instead ( ul )... That aside, this message is off the topic of accessibility and would be better suited for an HTML help list or a general web dev help list like WebDesign-L. 
Good luck, James PS. As a pre-emptive avoidance, the W3C HTML list is not the appropriate place for this either. 
thank for your help James, but why map shouldn't be there? 
why this is not a question for accessibility guys? 
i am want to know if some reader can understand this: map tittle="Navigation Map" .. to permit skip it. 
I use map tag to group a set ogf links (this is a 6.2 item's example "Grouping and bypassing links" from Html techniques for Web Accessibility Guidelines 1.0) regards

Hola Gabriel, James Actually this is on topic, because as Gabriel pointed out this comes 
from the WCAG techniques. 
Some years ago, some tools recognised a map and would allow the user to just pass over it. 
HTML 4 was designed so that map could contain a set of links that were available to be an imagemap, or could be presented as a simple block of text links. 
HTML 4.01 included very few changes to the DTD, but one of them was specifically designed to make this approach work better with existing tools - allowing groups of text links as well as map elements, whereas it had previously insisted on one or the other. 
This is probably something that should be taken up again in the Techniques task force of the WCAG group. 
Development in browsers has not really gone in that direction, and we seem to be stuck for the moment with actually putting little links around the page instead of 
having tools that help pass over a block of them. 
In other words, the map element isn't incorrect, but it is less helpful than the designers of HTML hoped, and I agree that you should have your list of elements inside it also in a list element. 
For two links it is not clear whether the extra link to skip them is worthwhile, but if you have five or six then it is a good idea to put it there, since so few people will be able to make use of your markup.

I guess I should rephrase that. 
I said "shouldn't" because my reference says "Conventional content within the map tag /may/ be displayed by the browser, area tags will not." 
To me that means conventional content may not be displayed. 
But if you have a good reason for using 
them, my choice of the word "shouldn't" was probably too strong. 
Sorry. 
On closer inspection of the HTML spec, map elements can ONLY contain area tags or block-level content. 
So it looks like you may want to use a ul inside your map anyway. 
Have you tried validating your source? 
Because this is an technical HTML problem. 
Although many of the technologies overlap, I think this particular question would be better suited for an HTML list. 
Cheers, James Craig 
(First of all sorry for my english) 
Not to strong, really. 
I apreciate your help. 
I am reformulate my question because I am not satisfied with my work (I am new about accessibility, sorry). 
I want to have a good menu (from accesibility perspective). 
I have 5 or 6 
links and use this like menu page. 
All my pages have this block of links and I want to give to user the posibility that can skip this block. 
What can I do? 
I am testing with IBM Home Page Reader 3.0 and Its really heavy to listen all the times the menu!. 
If this is not question to this list, say me.

Hello Gabriel, I think the best solution is to combine what you have been doing with what James suggests about including a list: ??????? li a href="#firstOption" Saltear barra de navegacion /a /li ?????? li a href="index.htm" 
class="Menu" title="P?gina 
de Inicio" accesskey="I" Inicio /a /li li a href="Contacto.htm" 
class="Menu" title="Acceso a la P?gina de Contacto"accesskey="C" Contacto /a /li ?Changes 
I made: 1. remove tabindex - because it is probably not necessary. 
If you have other links before the menu you might like to put it back. 
Alternatively you can put the menu after the main content, but make it appear near the top of the page, using a column layout with CSS float. 
Have a look at http://www.w3.org/2002/02/css-float-test.html for an example that explains itself, and has a spanish version. 
There are lots of other explanations of this... 2. remove hreflang="es" - I assume the starting page is also in spanish. 
If you use content or language negotiation to have multiple options available for some pages, this could even be misleading. 
As far as I know very old versions of Amaya are the only browser that won't show the content of the map. 
Some configurations of Lynx, new versions of Amaya, and probably some other browsers, allow you to skip over the entire block with a keystroke or two. 
Keeping the link there means you can skip past the menu with any browser...

No problem - but did you know that there are accessibility groups working in spanish (and other languages - finnish, french, italian, ...), who have members in this list as well? 
no need to be sorry - everybody is new when they begin :-) 
I think this question is very appropriate to the list...

Does Amaya allow you to skip over a list? 
I'd like to be able to use: 
ol title="main navigation" ... Instead of: ol ... And avoid the map altogether. 
For screen reader users, newer versions of JAWS and Window-Eyes allow users to skip from list to list, which is great, but it would be better if the title could be voiced to identify the list. 
There is no explicit screen reader support that I know of for skipping map , but you can skip to the next element of the same type as the currently focused element or to the next different element type. 
These are less useful to the average user than they could be because title information about the element is not voiced. 
AWK 
Yes, in Amaya you can navigate the document tree (up, next/previous, first child) directly. 
The current tree (actual element, parent, parent, parent...) is displayed in the status bar. 
In the structure view you can also move from element to element (the navigationn is synchronised, and you can hold the two views open at the same time to swap between them. 
(For all that, you need to write a lot of scripts to use it with screen readers, it is designed as a structured text editor that can browse, it doesn't do javascript or plugins, and there are some odd bugs or missing features. 
But I would find my life much harder without it). 
Being able to go to next element in other systems might be useful, but it would probably remain an advanced feature. 
Lynx can present the map as "map: whatever the title is" - you choose to enter it, and get a list of the links, or the next step is to pass over it". 
I don't think it is the default configuration though.

So is there benefit in using map in the case where ul title="main navigation" is used for a navigation bar? 
Seems redundant. 
I'm not confident that the semantics of map are so clearly defined as to justify the use of ol / ul instead (where the semantics don't scream "navigation bar" either, but in both cases the title attribute could be used to fill in the purpose).
