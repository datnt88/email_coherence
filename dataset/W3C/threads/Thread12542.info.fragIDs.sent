<s> From AUWG Teleconference Minutes (Feb 2, 2004)  </s>
<s> I had this "to do" ACESSIBLE CONTENT Action: KM, JR: to mull relationship between "Accessibility", "Accessible Content", "Accessibility Problem" This mail covers "Accessible Content" I researched the WAI Glossary the UAAG Glossary  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 WCAG 1 &amp; 2 don't have these terms in a glossary per se.  </s>
<s> You need to read a lot to come to your own conclusion.  </s>
<s> I came up with ACCESSIBLE CONTENT:  </s>
<s> 1) Content displayed by a user agent that is perceivable, operable, and  </s>
<s> understandable.  </s>
<s> 1a) Content displayed by a user agent that is perceivable, operable, and understandable by all users.  </s>
<s> 2) Content that is perceivable, operable, and understandable when displayed in a user agent.  </s>
<s> 2a) Content that is perceivable, operable, and understandable by all users when displayed in a user agent.  </s>
<s> Version 2 allows for content perhaps not being perfectly accessible during the creation process, but being accessible when completed.  </s>
<s> I wasn't sure whether to include "all users".  </s>
<s> The WAI Glossary has a def.  </s>
<s> of accessibility that says "The art of ensuring that, to as large an extent as possible, facilities (such as, for example, Web access) are available to  </s>
<s> people whether or not they have impairments of one sort or another."  </s>
<s> "To as  </s>
<s> large extent" seems to allow that it may not be 100% perfect at all times.  </s>
<s> Thus, I didn't know if including "all users" became slightly restrictive in some cases, or if excluding it would be too vague.  </s>
<s> Comments?? Perceivable, operable, and understandable have been stolen outright from WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> I like these words.  </s>
<s> I left out robust, because I just felt it could be left out here.  </s>
<s> Since 2.0 may be a longer time coming and 1.0 doesn't have these terms, can that give problems of any kind?  </s>
<s> They are really nice words!  </s>
<s> Comments?! Jutta?  </s>
<s> Anyone else?  </s>
<s> regards, Karen Mardahl  </s>
<s> Continuing the definition mulling from the AUWG Teleconference Minutes (Feb 2, 2004) ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEM: We have:  </s>
<s> Inaccessible Web content or authoring tools cannot be used by some people  </s>
<s> with disabilities.  </s>
<s> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [ WCAG20] describes how to create accessible Web content.  </s>
<s> I propose: The inability to access web content or authoring tools, especially by people  </s>
<s> with a disability.  </s>
<s> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] and  </s>
<s> 2.0 [WCAG20] describe the requirements for making web content accessible.  </s>
<s> *access* is meant to be a link (perhaps??) to the definition for access at "To interact with a system entity in order to manipulate, use, gain knowledge of, and/or obtain a representation of some or all of a system entity's resources."  </s>
<s> And maybe the "especially by people with a disability" can be dropped?  </s>
<s> It really doesn't matter who you are - if you can't get at the info you need, you've got an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> I was a bit unsure about the longevity of this definition with links to WCAG  </s>
<s> 1.0 and 2.0.  </s>
<s> We only have a [REF] to the 2.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> 1.0 is the TR.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the link could be to the WCAG home page and say "The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has guidelines that describe..." and sneak around the exact version that way?  </s>
<s> Comments?? Jutta?  </s>
<s> Anyone?  </s>
<s> regards, Karen Mardahl  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBLE CONTENT: content rendered by user agents that is fruible by  </s>
<s> all users and conform with WCAG guidelines.  </s>
<s> Sorry for wrong english.  </s>
<s> Fruible means "usable" in correct english.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBLE CONTENT: content rendered by user agents that is fruible by  </s>
<s> all users and conform with WCAG guidelines.  </s>
<s> I agree with keeping the definition of "accessible" broad enough to include all  </s>
<s> users (and all user-agents) irrespective of the reason why they may have  </s>
<s> difficulties with it.  </s>
<s> As a craftsman I don't care whether a user is disabled or not, indeed it's none of my business, but I do care about whether they can use what I build.  </s>
<s> However the case of people with disabilities does go beyond our moral duty as  </s>
<s> craftsmen and craftswomen to all our users and into the question of social justice.  </s>
<s> For those business interests that do not have an immediate concern with accessibility (the "uncoverted" so to speak) these two areas within accessibility have different effects; neglecting some users and some user-agents leaves them with a product that sucks, neglecting others can leave them with a lawsuit on their hands (and rightly so).  </s>
<s> As such I do think it is necessary to include the case of people with disabilities in a definition of accessible content (and accessible tools, and so on) though it may be useful to give other examples to emphasise that the focus is not entirely on that case (the case of search-engine spiders is always a good one for convincing those who are resistant to accessibility work that it may be in their own interests to pay more attention to these concerns).  </s>
<s> Jon Hanna *Thought provoking quote goes here*  </s>
<s> Since our guidelines are intended in part to guide developers in  </s>
<s> creating tools that result in the creation of WCAG compliant software  </s>
<s> I think it is very appropriate to use WCAG terms to define "accessible content."  </s>
<s> WCAG is undergoing many structural shifts but the terms you are using seem to have "sticking power."  </s>
<s> If WCAG 2.0 is not finalized in time perhaps we can define the terms within our document.  </s>
<s> I think we probably need to state who it needs to be perceivable,  </s>
<s> operable and understandable to - ie. to more than the author.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> I think this definition refers more to the person having the problem than the problem that prevents access.  </s>
<s> When I look through the document we use the term not in the sense: "I'm having an accessibility problem with this content," but more in the sense, " this is a problem that is preventing access."  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> The four point in WCAG 2.0 are:  </s>
<s> 1. perceivable 2. operable 3. understandable 4. robust So I think that we need to refer also to the point 4....  </s>
<s> Very good point, Jutta.  </s>
<s> My suggestion distorted the previous definition.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I prefer Jan's proposal in his mail of 8. Feb. (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0058.html)  </s>
<s> where he breaks it into a tool problem and a content problem.  </s>
<s> My vote goes  </s>
<s> to his 2 definitions!  </s>
<s> regards, Karen Of Jutta Treviranus I think this definition refers more to the person having the problem than the problem that prevents access.  </s>
<s> When I look through the document we use the term not in the sense: "I'm having an accessibility problem with this content," but more in the sense, " this is a problem that is preventing access."  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> people  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> WCAG  </s>
<s> My vote also.  </s>
