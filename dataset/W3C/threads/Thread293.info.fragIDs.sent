<s> -- Tidy accesses my html files OK and my config file but I cannot get a config file to work.  </s>
<s> If I use a nonexistant file for config.txt in the command it gives me an error message, and rightly so.  </s>
<s> But I'm not getting any error messages  </s>
<s> when I use config.txt  </s>
<s> so it seems like it does find the file and use it.  </s>
<s> It just doesn't do anything.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions ?  </s>
<s> I use this command: tidy -config config.txt  </s>
<s> book.html  </s>
<s> This is config.txt:  </s>
<s> indent: yes indent-spaces: 30 wrap: 72 markup: yes clean: yes output-xml: no input-xml: no show-warnings: no numeric-entities: yes quote-marks: yes quote-nbsp: yes quote-ampersand: no break-before-br: no uppercase-tags:Yes uppercase-attributes:Yes output-xhtml: yes char-encoding: latin1  </s>
<s> There are no indents and nothing is capitalized.  </s>
<s> I have no idea.  </s>
<s> The above works fine for me.  </s>
<s> I suspect that 30 spaces is a wee bit big for normal practice.  </s>
<s> I recommend using a lower case yes rather than Yes, but this shouldn't matter.  </s>
<s> Try downloading a more recent version of Tidy, as it is possible you are using a version that predates config files.  </s>

<s> I have the latest version, but I think I finally figured out what the problem was.  </s>
<s> In order to get my config file to work you must have deleted the white space before each line.  </s>
<s> Even with just a simple one line config file, such as "uppercase-tags:Yes", if I have one white space before the line it accesses the config file but ignores the line.  </s>
<s> I don't get any error messages, but nothing changes.  </s>
<s> When I delete the white space, it works as expected.  </s>
<s> Thanks for trying it out.  </s>
