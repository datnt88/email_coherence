I've added a new open design issue to the RDF Thesaurus Wiki page A summary of the issue: Issue 5 - Using Concepts for subject-based indexing and classification We want to be able to say, 'my article is about Concept x from Thesaurus y'. 
These statements could then be used for subject-based indexing. 
The question is, what property to we recommend to use to do this sort of thing? 
Do we invent a new one, or do we try to re-use something? 
2.5.1 Comments on Issue 5 AJM  We could go with qualified dublin core, and recommend using dc:subject. 
So in summary, I have suggested an approach to subject-based indexing using thesaurus concepts that is entirely consistent with all variations in the qualified dublin core approach. 
The question is, do we like dcq?
