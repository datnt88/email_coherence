<s> made to a claim earlier in this conversation trail, the average speed in London is not the same as it was 100 years ago.  </s>
<s> It is two and a half miles an hour slower.  </s>
<s> The individual vehicles may be capable of independently faster speeds, but collectively they move at a slower pace.  </s>
<s> So will it be on the web if care is not taken now.  </s>
<s> We all as individuals are totally unpredictable.  </s>
<s> But as a collective, the human race is totally predictable.  </s>
<s> As connection speeds increase and download times improve and technology moves on, we will be tempted to place heavier documents or images on our sites.  </s>
<s> This is already happening.  </s>
<s> 4 to 5 years ago it was considered correct to design to a 14k modem.  </s>
<s> Now we design to a 28k to 33k modem soon it will be a 56k.  </s>
<s> Download times however have not improved as dramatically as a whole.  </s>
<s> This will deteriorate with time, and technology will compensate only slightly.  </s>
<s> As a believer in the rights of every individual regardless, when it comes to personal pages they must remain exactly that.  </s>
<s> Are we that hypocritical as to push for the rights of every human being only to deny the rights of the non disabled individual to do what he/she wants ' in their own space' ?  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> We cannot assume the high moral ground and champion accessibility as a whole by trampling on the rights of other individuals to get our aims.  </s>
<s> This is blinkered vision, and will collectively be rejected.  </s>
<s> As to who is responsible for accessibility it has to be the designer.  </s>

<s> If we buy  </s>

<s> I am currently writing an article called "Friendly Fire" it poses the question "who is the greatest sinner?" the designer who builds a inaccessible site through ignorance, or the disabled designer who builds an inaccessible site to promote the rights of accessibility for the disabled community.  </s>

<s> Hi all.  </s>
<s> Here's my take as a web developer.  </s>
<s> I don't think the one click accessible solution is the complete answer.  </s>
<s> It would help a lot of developers create more accessible pages, but there are many web developers who don't like wysiwig tools and work in Unix or directly in the HTML.  </s>
<s> The e-mail "Blame List" surprised me, but if you're looking to blame designers for non-accessible pages you shouldn't forget their managers who set their priorities.  </s>
<s> Web content, being published and updated, may be set as the developers priority (with content tested in IE and Netscape).  </s>
<s> Some developers also may not know that the pages they are building are not accessible, and as naive as this may sound, they may not have heard that there is an issue.  </s>
<s> One thing about many of the non-accessible sites is that they were created by people who have access to develop for 2 FREE browsers: IE and Netscape.  </s>
<s> They can easily test their pages in those browsers.  </s>
<s> As a developer I've been on a quest for free accessible browsers and the only one that I've heard about so far is Brookes Talk.  </s>
<s> As a developer I would like to develop for everybody, it's a matter of figuring out how to do it; being able to test the pages and sites developed, communicating with end users to see what parts of the pages are hard to navigate, are annoying, or all out break.  </s>
<s> Since, for me, learning about accessibility is an 'after hours' project and I don't have an endless budget I can't go around buying up browsers to see how my pages are handled with them.  </s>
<s> I agree that developers should be creating accessible pages... we just need to learn how.  </s>

<s> Thanks for mentioning the person in authority.  </s>
<s> even when they are told there is an issue and even when the designer knows how to implement accessability, there are some managers that will not stand for anything but the big corporate look a-like or that latest gizmo or whatever.  </s>
<s> Much of the time, the final say is that of the person paying the designer no matter what the designer knows or can do.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the purchaser of the designer's service is high on the list of importance because if someone is willing to buy, they can usually find someone willing to sell.  </s>

<s> Suzanne, Often the companies that build accessible browsers will provide free copies to developers.  </s>
<s> Personally, I think that this is a very wise idea.  </s>
<s> It helps to ensure that more sites "look" good in that browser, and it provides added publicity.  </s>
<s> Usually, the trade-off is that you must include an icon on one of your sites and link it to the browser's home page.  </s>
<s> That seems fair.  </s>
<s> On most of my sites I try to include a page that talks about accessibility wrt the site.  </s>
<s> I tell my clients that it is "good PR" for them.  </s>
<s> That gives me a page to add such icons if need be.  </s>
<s> I got a copy of pwWebspeak a couple of years ago by this method.  </s>
<s> I don't know if they're still willing to do it.  </s>
<s> It doesn't cost them anything: as a "temporarily able-bodied" person, I am not a potential customer anyway.  </s>
<s> Try contacting those companies to see if they'll work a deal with you.  </s>
<s> Charles Munat, Seattle, Washington  </s>
<s> actually, if you code for what works in: ie, netscape and oppera lynx if you like, you should be covered. the problem with some of the other browsers is that they are propriatary, take a great deal to really master unless you have some background in assistave technology and do not keep up with the times necessarily.  </s>
<s> To test with browsers that are built for particular targets, the best solution is to find members of the target who use them well to assist.  </s>

<s> Hi all, Just I thought I'd throw some library science into the mix as far as access!  </s>
<s> Michael Buckland, a prof.  </s>
<s> at Berkeley's School of Information Management, has identified 6 barriers to access in the library world, and I believe #3-5 are quite applicable to this discussion.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Identification - If it hasn't been properly identified, you can't find it.  </s>
<s> (search engines) 2. Availability - Potential user needs to be able to see the source.  </s>
<s> (Interlibrary Loan, etc.) 3. Price to User - what does the user need to see the source?  </s>
<s> (hardware, software?) 4. Cost to Provider - what does it cost to provide this information?  </s>
<s> (knowledge, hardware, software?) 5. Cognitive ability of the user - can the user understand the source (this should also include physical ability/disability). 6. Acceptability - is the source credible, does it satisfy the user's need?  </s>
<s> #4 might cause some arguments.  </s>
<s> Although, we all know it does not cost much more to make something accessible, but most clients see only the price tag.  </s>
<s> In any case, these are the things I look at when trying to organize and retrieve information.  </s>
