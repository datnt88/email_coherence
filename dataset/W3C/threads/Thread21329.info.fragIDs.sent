<s> The status of Amay on the Mac, as far as I know... Damian Steer (and others) have compiled it under OS X and it runs fine.  </s>
<s> I have tried several times, but have always come up with a problem to do with linking to Lesstif libraries - I might have some spare time again this week to look and see if I can get it to compile properly.  </s>
<s> (The symptoms at the moment are that it starts, but crashes before it finishes drawing the opening screen).  </s>
<s> According to the fink project there is a release of Amaya that works on that, but it is in the unstable packages only (I believe they haven't done a lot of testng, and Amaya is in permamnent devlelopment - even release versions can have bugs) and they are using a very old version of the source.  </s>
