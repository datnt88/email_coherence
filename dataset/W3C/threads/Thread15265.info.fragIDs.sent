<s> Question: Do search engines really scan alt text given for images  </s>
<s> snip /  </s>
<s> one of my co-workers was architect at alta-vista so I asked him;  </s>
<s> seems  </s>
<s> that 'most' search engines should be expected to parse text that is  </s>
<s> in  </s>
<s> elements and can be expected to parse certain attribute values, like alt, as well.  </s>
<s> I also remember cases (when searching via Google) where 'alt' attribute values were shown, but unfortunately I was neither able to reproduce  </s>
<s> this nor  </s>
<s> have I found documentation about this right now.  </s>
<s> Search engines and indexing is something I spent some time studying and as far as I am aware search engines do not use alt text in indexing in practice any longer.  </s>
<s> There are a few points related to this, the main reason why not to use it in indexing is to avoid 'non-visual stuffing', which is a practice where a page is filled with keywords in an attempt to aim a high ranking score on search engines.  </s>
<s> In order to not put  </s>
<s> users off this text was often hidden in the alt text of images or in text of the same colour as the background.  </s>
<s> To avoid genuine results being offset by these techniques engines such as google largely ignore alt text, and even metadata in the meta tags.  </s>
<s> The other issue is that  </s>
<s> alt text is semantically dead.  </s>
<s> So while a 'real' text alternative as provided by the object tag can contain markup with em , hX and so on alt attribute text at the most can be one of these types if the images tag is wrapped by it.  </s>
<s> (i.e. h1 img src="logo.jpg"  </s>
<s> alt="My company" / /h1 ).  </s>
<s> I might add that most of the internal workings of each search engine are confidential and this is to some extent speculation.  </s>

<s> Ok, it's been awhile since I wrote mainly because I'm working with the State of Oklahoma on their accessibility issues and the meetings happen to coincide with our teleconference.  </s>
<s> So, please accept my apologies for not making it to the WCAG WG meetings.  </s>
<s> I will return as soon as I can.  </s>
<s> Now, onto this particular issue.  </s>
<s> ALL search engines that use spiders/robots index using the ALT text.  </s>
<s> Just because your test fails does not mean that you are correct.  </s>
<s> No slighting here intended, but it is obvious to those that work in the field of search engine optimization that you may not be aware that Google has major problems right now.  </s>
<s> Any tests you perform on Google currently my not work as it may have a few weeks ago nor as it may a few weeks from now.  </s>
<s> Google has lost 100's of thousands of pages from their index as a result of some major issues they are having.  </s>
<s> Now, let's simply put the issue to bed.  </s>
<s> In the webmaster help sections for each search engine they state that you should use ALT text to include additional keywords.  </s>
<s> The problem with this broad statement is that many of the unethical and rookie SEO companies spam the search engines through the medium of ALT and TITLE attributes.  </s>
<s> Of ALL the search engines I optimize for I have yet to find one that uses the TITLE attribute, but all use the ALT attribute.  </s>
<s> Now, let's go one step further.  </s>
<s> Just because a _jaded_ test fails doesn't mean that your test is a good test.  </s>
<s> If it is not a word or phrase that is normally searched upon, that word or phrase may not be indexed as of yet.  </s>
<s> So, perhaps you can answer this question.  </s>
<s> With all the pages in the world available to me to index, why would I waste space with something so minor that the only place you put it is in your ALT attribute?  </s>
<s> If I were a search engine, I wouldn't.  </s>
<s> If you think the search engines are rolling through billions of pages upon every search entered you're mistaken.  </s>
<s> Those searches are cached searches that their system performs every few days.  </s>
<s> I hope this helps.  </s>

<s> It looks like once you are actually in Google's Image search, alt text is used in the search.  </s>
<s> However, if in Google's default search, alt tags are not used for search purposes (at least this is what I found).  </s>
