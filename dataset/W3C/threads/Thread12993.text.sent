I am attempting to build a business case for web accessibility and am look for actual dollar costs [or percentage of total cost] of making sites accessible, both new and existing sites. 
We all know the legal ramifications, but has any research been done into the actual cost to business? 
I'd appreciate any and all leads to information. 
And, as usual, time is a factor here. 
Thanks. 
Although it doesn't contain any hard numbers, this is at least a resource you can cite: ROI on Accessibility, Russell Windman eWeek - 7/30/01 http://www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2798040,00.html 
Anecdotally,--Sorry, I know this doesn't much help you--Kynn's house metaphor is perfect: if the layout is clever and the materials good, the building not only lasts but *remains useful* much longer--it's really quite remarkable the difference. 
Unfortunately, like you mention, lots of homeowners are willing to trade: bigger house for lesser quality. 
Best wishes, Liz Adam, you have provided us with some useful insight, although, as was pointed out, this represents the cost of implementing a completely new process. 
The up-front development time and learning curve are undeniably part of the cost, but you can't easily predict the future costs based upon the up-front costs alone. 
In my own development, I have been developing with accessibility in mind for at least a couple of years now, and it is impossible for me to put a percentage or price tag on the difference between an inaccessible design and an accessible design, because all of my designs are meant to be accessible. 
I don't add on anything to the process at this point, because accessibility _IS_ my process. 
When a company reaches this point, then there is almost no point in asking a question like this. 
I would venture a guess (non-scientific, but an educated guess), that a company which always designs accessibly will likely recover any and all additional development costs by virtue of being able to serve and attract a compensatory number of clients with disabilities. 
A very important point to underscore is that accessibility is not an add-on to the process. 
You don't design something and then at the end try to determine whether or not is accessible. 
By the time the developers get that far, it's already too late. 
Accessibility is implemented at every stage of the game. 
If the designers are thinking in terms of accessibility from the beginning, it really doesn't take "extra" time to tack-on accessibility, because the process is so intertwined with all of the other aspects of design. 
In fact, you're not "tacking on" anything at all. 
You are simply creating the desired result, which (oh, by the way) is accessible. 
That's the shift that has to occur. 
Once it does, then Glenda's question will be a thing of the past. 
It's like asking how much extra does it cost a company to make things work in both Netscape and Internet Explorer. 
No one asks this question anymore, because everyone knows that they just have to do it, and it's a part of the process.

What we've found - mostly from experience in designing/developing the 508 Universe and training for GSA - is that our total costs increased 25% of the total project cost (compared to not considering accessibility issues). 
Most of this increase was due to quality control cycles that incorporated a new level of complexity. 
We tested the site for 508 compliancy using different AT - such as JAWS and Home Page Reader - that were identified by the client as representative of the audience's needs. 
In the future, we hope this cost will decrease as we reuse templates that are considered compliant, use a formal quality control process for accessibility, and use previously identified resources to test pages. 
Of course, as we experiment with different designs in an effort to create new templates, this increase cost will need to be considered. 
And as new technologies are developed, we'll need to consider incorporating them into the quality control process, possibly lengthening it further.

Subscribe to our FREE newsletter by emailing The W3C WAI Education &amp; Outreach working group has a draft Business Case [1] which also includes an appendix of cost considerations [2]. 
Good references but no real numbers. 
All the data I've seen is not very detailed so one doesn't know if it includes training costs, or if the designer already knows about accessibility, or if there was an existing accessible template, how was testing done, etc. 
And the same problem exists with the original costs of development, so percentages are not very helpful and often misleading. 
Although when forced to give someone a number, it is usually in the 10-25% range, but I've gotten higher than 100% when it was an old inaccessible Java applet and lower than 10% when it was only missing alt text.. 
One thing for sure, it takes extra effort, expense, or time to do anything, whether it is accessible or not.

What we've found - mostly from experience in designing/developing the 508 Universe and training for GSA - is that our total costs increased 25% of the total project cost (compared to not considering accessibility issues). 
Or in other words, the conclusion was that if you do a less than thorough job, you can save 20%. 
I bring this up not to put down Adam -- in fact I thank him for these figures -- but to emphasize that for the most part this is not an "extra cost for accessibility" but rather the full cost of "doing it right." 
If I build a house correctly, it might cost $75,000. 
If I leave out essential parts necessary for it to be a good house -- maybe the insulation, skim a little on the materials, use smaller doors, or whatever, I can cut that cost by 20%. 
If someone requires me to not cut corners, they're not costing me an extra 25% -- I'm just not able to get away with doing a lesser quality job. 
That is how I approach the "extra cost of web accessibility" issue. 
Accessible web design has always been an integral part of -overall- web design; it's not an add-on, it's simply doing it right. 
We always should have been developing with user diversity in mind; we always should have been testing on a wide variety of output devices; we always should have been enforcing rigorous QA and evaluation. 
It's actually a shame that it required a law to be passed in order to get many of us to stop taking short cuts, and just do a quality job. 
--Kynn PS: Again, this is not a flame against Anteon or a criticism of anything they have done; I have merely taken their figures and used it as a starting point for the discussion. 
I have no reason to believe that Anteon's quality has been anything less than optimal in the past; my statements reflect a judgment upon the web development industry as a whole.

Subscribe to our FREE newsletter by emailing I still think it's important for Fed's to listen instead of comment. 
However, this is what I would do if a web developer told me it was too expensive: Ask lots of questions! 
Go into the details: How much will it cost? 
Why do you believe that is too much? 
What specifically are those costs for? 
- itemize labor per page For each item on that list, what is the basis for your cost estimate? 
What alternatives did you consider? 
Then I would start picking on the less expensive items and ask: What if you did these things -- would that be too expensive? 
If so, why? 
If they still say doing anything is too expensive, then the web site must not be worth much and why are they bothering having one? 
For each reason they come up with for having one, there must be some value, and so that value can be enhanced (or diminished) by making the site accessible to more (or fewer) people. 
When you challenge the conclusion that the cost is too much, and ask for the details, usually one of two things happen: You get specific information that you can use to determine YOUR alternatives (like, design an accessible web site for $25,000 vs. fix the current one for $50,000); or, The designer realizes that you are going to pester them with questions until you get what you want, and it takes less time to fix the compliance problems than it does to answer your questions.

There's definitely a cost involved.

Subscribe to our FREE newsletter by emailing Glenda, If you have to repair pages assuming the work was initially done poorly, very inaccessibly, figure .5 hour per page to fix. 
And you put the $ value on those hours. 
It is relatively expensive to correct existing sites. 
Almost all sites have some form of template that most pages are based on or grow from. 
In the grand scheme of things it costs nothing to get that template correct and then produce pages ad nauseum that are accessible. 
The net - costs next to nothing. 
I have often heard a 10% - 15% figure for the cost of accessible stuff (web, software). 
But I think that is too high. 
Almost all access issues are found in the templates and when access is fixed there, hundreds/thousands of pages go by for free. 
So I am going to place a stake in the ground and estimate that generally accessible web is almost negligible. 
If you are producing page at a time and doing it accessibly it is just not that much work. 
If you are using templates it is even less. 
Think of a complex table. 
Think of how much time goes into planning on how to present that table, and how to code it. 
Then add a bit to have the correct accessibility coding. 
A nit relatively. 
Why don't people say that? 
Do y'all disagree?
