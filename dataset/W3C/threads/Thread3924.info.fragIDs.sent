INTRODUCTION My name is Joseph Reagle and I've agreed to Chair the proposed "Beyond HTTP (BH) Task Force". 
I was involved in the earlier days of P3P and have since been working on XML Signature, Encryption, and Key Management. 
This task force is defined at [1] and would be governed by the charter presently under review at [2]; I agree to work according to those terms. 
[1] http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/03-tf.html#beyond [2] http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/01-spec-charter.html 
The stated goal of the task force is to identify requirements for associating P3P policies with protocols other than HTTP, propose a method that satisfies those requirements, and document any changes to the P3P vocabulary arising from the proposal. 
Web Services are rather complex and I'm skeptical of some of the scenarios I've seen regarding their usage but my sense is that the desire is that if they are used to solicit or transport personal information they too should be governed by a privacy policy. 
As identified in [1], probably the best way to get traction on the problem is to "survey the field" and start with a scenario. 
SURVEY and SCENARIOS I'll note that AC020 of the Web Services Architecture Requirements [3] has very specific requirements on this topic. 
I've previously commented on this draft and the requirements seem reasonable. 
[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wsa-reqs-20021114#AC020 AC020 enables privacy protection for the consumer of a Web service across multiple domains and services. 
+ AR020.1 the WSA must enable privacy policy statements to be expressed about Web services. 
+ AR020.2 advertised Web service privacy policies must be expressed in P3P [85][P3P]. 
+ AR020.3 the WSA must enable a consumer to access a Web service's advertised privacy policy statement. 
+ AR020.5 the WSA must enable delegation and propagation of privacy policy. 
+ AR020.6: Web Services must not be precluded from supporting interactions where one or more parties of the interaction are anonymous. 
The most interesting/difficult requirement is with respect to delegation and propagation. 
The Web Services Architecture Usage Scenarios has a Third Party Intermediary scenario [4] that is perhaps closes to what we would want to do? 
[4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-scenarios-20020730/#S030 
While I've looked at the WS-Policy specifications [5] I think it's perhaps best to play with this scenario in the context of a SOAP message header [6] or a WSDL definition [7] for the time being. 
[5] [6] http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#muprocessing [7] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315#A3 
I haven't made an attempt at it yet -- has anyone else? -- but I hope to soon. 
However, even without doing so, I ask myself if: 1. 
Does the privacy statement belong at the SOAP level, or HTTP? 
In the majority of cases SOAP will be transported over HTTP, what happens if both of a HTTP statement? 
2. Does the privacy statement belong at the WSDL level? 
Not every service must have a service description. 
And if they did for the purposes of privacy then *have* to fetch the WSDL before proceeding with the interaction? 
My sense here is that SOAP would trump the OPTIONAL WSDL definition. 
So! Sorry for the long introduction, but I hope the other task force members will introduce themselves too and provide any requirements, scenarios, or questions they have as well! 
* Note, I will be on Holiday from March 24-26.

Hi Joseph, 
Here are a couple of things where I've attempted to take policies that are { similar to | derived from | stolen and wrecked | ... } P3P's and make mechanisms other than some set of HTTP methods transport apply. 
In cronological order: 
1. CPExchange, a customer profile exchange application-layer protocol, with no transport binding. 
The DTD for this and the pre-bubble bumpf are still available at 
While no substantive work has taken place in this area since late '00, aside from the obvious "bits cribbed from P3P, why and how?" set of questions, there is the notion of both j19n ("jurisdictionalization") and record-route. 
2. HTTP WG, an IETF WG (concluded). 
During the last year of the WG, Dan Jaye contributed a draft that extended the Kristol, Montulli draft on the state management mechanism, RFC 2965. 
This draft has expired, but I have it (co-author). 
The IESG published a note written by Moore and Freed (RFC 2964), on the problem domain, observing that some uses of the mechanism were harmful, and depricated policied cookies. 
Parts of this draft were not adopted by anyone, e.g., use of x.509 certs, but some parts were, e.g., some sort of policy mark-up, in cookie headers, initially by Microsoft, circa IE 5.5, and simultaniously by the P3P Spec WG. 
The draft is available via anonymous ftp from nic-naa.net. 
The file name is draft-jaye-http-trust-state-mgt-01.txt 
3. PROVREG WG, an IETF WG (current). 
The problem domain defined by Verisign's RRP protocol, using EBNF as the formal syntax, is slightly restated in EPP, using XML as the formal syntax. 
Neither multi-hop "onward transport", nor data collection by other means, sort of between the two prior problems and their solutions. 
Server-announced policied sessions with clients, transport over TCP. 
There is a counter-proposal to simply mark fields with a bit to policy publication by WHOIS servers, and ignore any other data collection policy issues. 
This is advanced by the IESG. 
All brain-damange is the responsibility of the author, which is mostly me. 
Not shown, because neither I nor anyone else wrote anything up, are any "demark crossing" notes, inspired by attending the W3C/WAPF meeting in Munich in late '00, and re-inspired by the webi/dci/opes (rewrite at the edge) IETF bofs and the IRTF digital rights activity (concluded). 
Both are transitive proof of correctness with intermediary rewrite rules. 
Cheers, Eric 
INTRODUCTION 
my name is Marc Langheinrich and i'm interested in joining the "beyond http" taskforce. 
i've been involved in p3p early on (fall 99) and ended up being one of the authors of the p3p spec. 
i am also the editor for the appel working draft. 
in real life i am a phd-student at the swiss federal institute of technology ("eth" is its german abbreviation) in zurich, switzerland, working in the field of pervasive or ubiquitous computing. 
not surprisingly, my phd topic is 'privacy in ubiquitous computing'. 
i've been trying to use p3p in the ubiquitous computing prototypes we're building in our group, and have at one point tried to integrate it into a soap protocol (though blissfully ignoring any web service architecture work, i confess). 
a brief description of my prototype system can be found in a technote i presented at the "ubiquitous computing" conference in 2002 at http://www.inf.ethz.ch/vs/publ/papers/privacy-awareness.pdf -m Marc Langheinrich langhein@inf.ethz.ch

Thanks Eric, does this mean you would like to be listed as a member of the taskforce? 
smile/ I've briefly looked into each of of the apps below looking for salient requirements and/or features of a scenario that might be relevant. 
Please correct me if you think I've missed something. 
This appears to be an extension of the P3P privacy vocabulary with a more extensive XML data profile based on XML Schema data types. 
It appears they have the significant portion with {Access, Purpose, Retention, Recipient}. 
Because it's based on a 2000 snapshot of P3P I can't discern any particular divergence in the privacy vocabulary because of this app's context. 
I can conclude that they felt there was a need for more extensive and XML Schema typed data structures that would perhaps be of interest to the P3P Schema taskforce. 
I followed this work back in the day and my conclusion would be that there was a requirement for terse expression. 
This appears to be satisfied with compact policies and I would expect other apps with a similar requirement to use them, or perhaps in the future a binary-XML representation of the complete markup...? I've included this in 
I'm unfamiliar with this work but I've poked about on: and see they have a : """ - A dcp (data collection policy) element that contains child elements used to describe the server's privacy policy for data collection and management.""" with an {access, purpose, retention}, elements based on P3P. 
Since this is active work, I think it makes sense to ask them why don't they use the elements from P3P itself? 
And if there are reasons, we'd appreciate the feedback. 
Do you have connections with this work, could you help start that conversation? 
Thanks for catching my drift Mark! smile/ I've linked to your introduction from: and hope the other members of the Task Force will follow suit!
