<s> I've compared Kynn Bartlett's summary of TABLE techniques to the WCAG2 TABLE techniques and listed my observations below.  </s>
<s> (This is in regard to bug 248 of the WCAG 2 HTML techniques.) Kynn's summary can be found at: The WCAG 2 table techniques can be found at: Both documents agree that there are 2 general types of tables: layout and data.  </s>
<s> I've heard arguments that all tables are used to organize information so there is really only one type of table - layout.  </s>
<s> I believe there is widespread disagreement with this argument and that we can distinguish between the 2 types of tables.  </s>
<s> The WCAG techniques offers that layout tables are "used to organize data" and layout tables are "used to create a visual layout of the page".  </s>
<s> This definition sounds reasonable to me.  </s>
<s> Kynn goes further to distinguish between "simple" data tables and "complex" data tables.  </s>
<s> A table is complex if it uses colspan, rowspan, nested headers (more than one row or column header applies to the same data), or more than one row/column header per table cell.  </s>
<s> The WCAG techniques treat all data tables the same.  </s>
<s> I believe that the WCAG techniques for data tables cover both "simple" and "complex" tables and there is no need to differentiate.  </s>
<s> I've heard it suggested that tables be used for either layout or data but not both.  </s>
<s> This appears to be a useful suggestion but I don't see it mentioned in either document.  </s>
<s> I suggest the WCAG techniques add a statement that tables be used for entirely data or layout and not mixed.  </s>
<s> LAYOUT TABLES Style Sheets - Both documents state that authors should use style sheets for layout and positioning instead of tables (Kynn's also suggests using HTML's valign and align).  </s>
<s> Is it realistic that style sheets be used instead of tables?  </s>
<s> When is it necessary to use tables instead of style sheets?  </s>
<s> I propose that the WCAG techniques remove the condition of style sheets use unless the techniques include the conditions under which layout tables may be used.  </s>
<s> There needs to be some definition of when layout tables are good/bad compared to style sheets.  </s>
<s> Summary - Kynn states that layout tables should have summaries while the WCAG techniques do not mention summaries for layout tables.  </s>
<s> I've heard from some users that they do not like summaries, especially long  </s>
<s> ones, on layout tables.  </s>
<s> It can hinder them from getting at the page content.  </s>
<s> Other users like summaries on all layout tables.  </s>
<s> I propose that the technique for layout table summaries is that the first layout table have a short summary (less than 150 characters, English) that states the table is used for layout.  </s>
<s> Following layout tables should have a short summary stating "layout table" or, even better and following our rule on spacer gifs, have a NULL summary  </s>
<s> (summary="").  </s>
<s> Appearance of table elements - Both documents agree that CSS should be used to style table elements such as TH.  </s>
<s> Is it wrong to use HTML color attributes?  </s>
<s> Does the WCAG insist on using CSS over HTML styling?  </s>
<s> I propose that the WCAG techniques wording be changed to suggest, not insist, the use of style sheets over HTML styling.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the statement about CSS should be removed?  </s>
<s> Linearized tables - Both documents agree that tables should make sense when linearized (read in row order).  </s>
<s> Is this still a problem?  </s>
<s> Don't most screen readers now handle tables well?  </s>
<s> What if you want your table be read in column order?  </s>
<s> What about languages that read right-to-left or top-to-bottom?  </s>
<s> How do we test for "make sense"?  </s>
<s> I propose that the statement be removed from the WCAG techniques.  </s>
<s> The WCAG techniques contain a paragraph "Until user agents render side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text equivalent...".  </s>
<s> I think that screen readers now handle side-by-side correctly and most authors are not going to create a linear text equivalent.  </s>
<s> This "until user agents" statement should be removed from the techniques.  </s>
<s> The techniques also contain several paragraphs regarding word wrap in table cells.  </s>
<s> It states that "...developers may minimize the risk of word wrapping by limiting the amount of text in each cell".  </s>
<s> Is this still a good suggestion?  </s>
<s> How much text should each cell be limited to?  </s>
<s> Markup for formatting - Both documents state that markup elements (like TH) should not be used for formatting text.  </s>
<s> Makes sense.  </s>
<s> Kynn goes further to state that TH, TBODY, THEAD should not be used at all in layout tables.  </s>
<s> Is there a reason to use these elements in a layout table?  </s>
<s> If not then I propose that a statement be added to the WCAG techniques so that these elements should not be used in layout tables.  </s>
<s> I like the idea of a pure layout table.  </s>
<s> Caption - Kynn says not to use.  </s>
<s> The WCAG Techniques don't say.  </s>
<s> I propose that the techniques add a statement to exclude the caption from layout tables.  </s>
<s> Title - Kynn says don't use because it will cause unwanted tooltips.  </s>
<s> WCAG Techniques doesn't say.  </s>
<s> I propose the techniques add a statement to exclude the title from layout tables.  </s>
<s> Use the summary instead.  </s>
<s> Headers, scope and access - Kynn says don't use.  </s>
<s> WCAG Techniques doesn't say.  </s>
<s> Are there any problems/benefits to using these on layout tables?  </s>
<s> I propose we restrict them from layout tables.  </s>
<s> Colspan and rowspan - Kynn says to use to enhance the readability of table.  </s>
<s> WCAG Techniques don't say.  </s>
<s> Does this need a mention in the techniques?  </s>
<s> I look forward to hearing your comments.  </s>
<s> I'll post a message on the techniques for data tables in the next couple of days.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chris  </s>
<s> A suggestion for refer to bugs in this list (also for let the user order them) Why don't start the message with the object [Bxxx] where xxx is the number of the bug= in this case the object could be: "[B248] Table Techniques - Layout" This will made more clear the read and the follow-up of the messages per bug.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion Roberto.  </s>
<s> I'll use it in the future.  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> This is a suggestion that must be accepted by the group :)  </s>
