For many people a browser that renders graphics is very important. 
But for some, a browser that renders only text is more useful. 
This might be ebcause graphics can provide unwelcome distraction - there are some disabilities that affects people's ability to concentrate enough to read text if there is too much graphical material, movement, or colour with it. 
There are some people who do not see the graphics anyway - many people who are using speech output systems, and most people using braille display, are doing it because they are blind, so the graphics is no use to them anyway.. If a text-based browser is otherwise more useful (faster, better interface, etc) then it makes sense to use one. 
In fact for certain features the text-based browsers provide better access to the information that is encoded in the page than the combination of a graphical browser and speech technology. 
But this changes all the time - there are new browsers available most weeks. 
For some people it is also a restriction of their device, or effectively required for speed. 
When I am not able to connect with a line faster than 9600 baud I tend not to be interested in downloading graphics content. 
I use lynx or links, both of which give a much better presentation for my needs than a graphics browser that has the graphics turned off. 
(And I attach all kinds of media players to them so I can choose which images to download easily, or which audio to listen to.) just my 2c worth Charles McCN Vadim Plessky asked, at BTW: what are advantages if using text-based browser? 
I really do not understand that. 
Graphics environment has so many advantage over text so I am quite confused to hear this.

Of course, blind people do not need graphics being send over internet connection, it's just waste of time and bandwidth. 
My point was that you can always disable images (via menu or via CSS: img { display: none !important } ) when you don't need them. 
Sure. 
But that should also disable rendering of the text alternatives, and very often I do need those. 
Lynx and links and emacs/W3 hhave good ways of getting at the text altternative content, compared to graphical browsers. 
Now let's think about somebody who has visual disability (say, miopia, in -10..-5 range) and wants to use web. 
It will be quite logical to use *graphical* browser for a such person, and in addition *to increase font size* for all pages. 
Absolutely true. 
For most people it is important to have a graphical capability. 
Even when I use a text browser, I have it configured to be able to show images if I think I need them. 
(Again, lynx is the best interface I know of for only showing particular images and at the same time getting good text alternatives). 
This is getting a bit out of the topic, but... But does it makes sense to use such lines (9600 baud) nowdays? 
For example, I use PPP (dial-up), and if I can't connect faster than 19200 (say, at least 28800) - I just make a break, drink a cup of tea (as I prefer tea to cofee :-) and try later. 
Well, my mobile phone only has connections at 9600 baud. 
So if I am on a train all day and need to work (this happens to me about 5 days a year) that's as much as I get for now. 
Also, it is still the case that I get a connection at something very slow on a PPP (which I use a lot) for several days in a row - too long to have a break and try again. 
(Maybe I just need to increase my coffee capacity grin/ ) WAP: yes, I know also about WAP and mobile phones. 
But WAP just sucks, it's dead format. 
I interviewed a lot of people about mobile communication (mostly - General Managers or other top-level managers), and most of them replied that they do not need it [ "I use phone to make calls, that's it"]. 
I know that this can sound very different from, say, Gartner reports - but I prefer to trust to real-world reports, not to synthetic ones. 
So, WAP is not excuse here at all. 
I don't think the issue of whether WAP as a format is any good is the same as the issue of whether people use mobile devices - many people I know use mobile devices to get access for their normal services, and it is slow. 
I don't think we can force "them" to adopt SVG in any area, but I think it is happening anyway. 
And other than mobile devices I don't think there is a big bandwidth problem. 
The other intersting problem is high-latency connections, and that is still only research for people doing space travel planning. 
cheers Chaals Well bandwidth may be a problem for some people using non mobile devices. 
Until last year the Perth Observatory int he hills outside perth about 20 km from the city centre op Perth Western Australia could only get about 5000 baud connections due to the old exchange. 
The introduction of satelite could have improved this now but as satelite requires an uplink by modem I dont know if it applies anywhere else.

When you use anti-aliasing, quality of displayed text improoves, too. 
BTW: that's one of the reasons why I do not use Windows anymore. 
Anti-Aliased (AA) text in XFree86 4.1/Linux is so much better than in Windows, that just this fact , in my opinion, should attract people with Visual Disabilities to Linux. 
[ just guessing now wether they know abbout this fact?... ] // explanation: Windows has 5 shades of grey, XFree86 with RENDER extension/AA - 255 shades of gray. 
More info can be found at Please let me know if someone is interested to see screenshot. 
BTW: One of quantative approaches to measure rendering quality (and quality of rendered text, in particular) is ... to make screenshot of rendered page and save it in PNG (or JPEG) format. 
For anti-aliased text/page, size of screenshot will be 5-8 times bigger than for the same page without AA. While, at a first glance, your eye doesn't see these "small details", eyes definitly consume (and appreciate!) extra info. 
It reduces working constrain, readability and finally increase productivity (ah, have I said that all companies should buy their employees flat-panel LCD screens, as you can do sub-pixel decimation with those panels and increase productivity even further?) But does it makes sense to use such lines (9600 baud) nowdays?

Both providers I use have "peak hours", plus all public holidays can be considered as a "peak days". 
So, I just have to live with it "as is", until I will be able to afford paying $150/month for DSL line (or DSL price will go down) WAP: yes, I know also about WAP and mobile phones.

Any ideas about other types of devices (which may need low bandwidth)? 
I can imagine kitchen-appliance wishing to do some web browsing, but I guess this appliance should be routed through home firewall in any case, as otherwise it becomes too unsecure. 
And most likely your home router will be conncted to DSSL line or to cable/broadband connection. 
Sa, bandwidth is not an issue here - but screen size, indeed, can be a problem. 
Therefor, another question comes here in mind: shouldn't we force usage of Icons (SVG icons/drawings, in particular, in such small devices)? 
And, as for blind people - something "beeping" or making other sounds in the kitchen makes much more sense than coffee-maker machine with text-based browsing interface (wether it has Lynx built-in or not, doesn' t matter much) Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes
