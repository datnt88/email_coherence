<s> The following wording as been added as technique #3 to guideline C.1 - Only use technologies defined in a W3C specification...  </s>
<s> When linking to resources that are not W3C technologies, indicate what type of resource you are linking to.  </s>
<s> For example, to link to a PDF file from an HTML document, set the "type" attribute to "application/pdf" on the A element.  </s>
<s> [Priority&amp;nbsp;3] thoughts?  </s>
<s> --the editors  </s>
<s> I agree that it would be advisable to use the TYPE attribute in this case, but the basic guideline should still recommend that non-W3C technologies be avoided, as there will necessarily be one or more user agents that do not support it.  </s>
<s> Needless to say, if such file formats are used, standard alternatives need to be provided.  </s>
<s> I also encountered a page recently which required client-side Javascript functionality in order for any of the links to be activated.  </s>
<s> This kind of design needs to be avoided also.  </s>

<s> What is the W3C recommendation for a sound file?  </s>
<s> I am concerned that this demand is not reasonable.  </s>
<s> A sound file is much more easy to listen to than text-to-speech from a transcript.  </s>
<s> The W3C just does not have an adequate complement of technologies that are "W3C products" to expect people to limit themselves to these.  </s>
<s> Yes. We need to make it crystal clear that this is not cool.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that the way to state this is in a rewrite of Daniel's "text is king" idea: Key requirement (navigability): Orientation to a web presence and navigation through and within it must work substantially as well with images and scripts turned off as with full multimedia and dynamic features turned on.  </s>
<s> This implies that all information necessary for orientation and navigation must be available in the static hypertext [today, HTML] of the site, using the elements and attributes defined in W3C recommendations in the way discussed in this document.  </s>
<s> Rewrite this in Plain English and it belongs in the Executive Summary of the Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Note: static here means as received at the UA.  </s>
<s> This does not mean that the HTML cannot be generated by a server-side script.  </s>
<s> Al PS: draw analogy to elevators and fire stairs.  </s>
<s> Tall buildings still _must have_ the stairs, even 'though most traffic uses the elevators.  </s>
