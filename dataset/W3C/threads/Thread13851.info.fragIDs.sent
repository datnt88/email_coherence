The following wording as been added as technique #3 to guideline C.1 - Only use technologies defined in a W3C specification... 
When linking to resources that are not W3C technologies, indicate what type of resource you are linking to. 
For example, to link to a PDF file from an HTML document, set the "type" attribute to "application/pdf" on the A element.

I agree that it would be advisable to use the TYPE attribute in this case, but the basic guideline should still recommend that non-W3C technologies be avoided, as there will necessarily be one or more user agents that do not support it. 
Needless to say, if such file formats are used, standard alternatives need to be provided. 
I also encountered a page recently which required client-side Javascript functionality in order for any of the links to be activated. 
This kind of design needs to be avoided also. 
to follow up on what Jason White said: 
What is the W3C recommendation for a sound file? 
I am concerned that this demand is not reasonable. 
A sound file is much more easy to listen to than text-to-speech from a transcript. 
The W3C just does not have an adequate complement of technologies that are "W3C products" to expect people to limit themselves to these. 
Yes. We need to make it crystal clear that this is not cool. 
I would suggest that the way to state this is in a rewrite of Daniel's "text is king" idea: Key requirement (navigability): Orientation to a web presence and navigation through and within it must work substantially as well with images and scripts turned off as with full multimedia and dynamic features turned on. 
This implies that all information necessary for orientation and navigation must be available in the static hypertext [today, HTML] of the site, using the elements and attributes defined in W3C recommendations in the way discussed in this document. 
Rewrite this in Plain English and it belongs in the Executive Summary of the Recommendation. 
Note: static here means as received at the UA. 
This does not mean that the HTML cannot be generated by a server-side script. 
Al PS: draw analogy to elevators and fire stairs. 
Tall buildings still _must have_ the stairs, even 'though most traffic uses the elevators.
