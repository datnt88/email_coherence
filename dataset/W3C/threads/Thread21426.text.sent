The annotations database seems to be down again; the interactive interface shows Cannot connect as "root" to localhost:3306 with "DBI:mysql:annotest:localhost:3306" switching to ephemoral DB However a GET on annotest.w3.org?w3c_annotates=[url]&amp;w3c_forceText=* just returns a 200 status with no annotations included: r:RDF xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml#" xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#" xmlns:d="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/" 
xmlns:http="http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/http#" xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" / Would it not make more sense to return some kind of HTTP error code? 
Matthew wilson I smacked the server upside the head. 
It works now. 
Whether "no annotations found" is a 404 has been a long standing issue. 
A stronger case could be made for "no annotations found 'cause the db isnt abswering." 
The hope was that people could play with the server even if it wasn't talking to a database. 
Perhaps they could "play with" it even if they got error messages back?

The problem is for a tool trying to use the database: it has no indication of the error status. 
Matthew I agree. 
One of the following status codes would be more appropriate to return when the database is down: 500 Internal Server Error 503 Service Unavailable Mark Smith LDAP Book Information: http://www.ldapbook.com/
