<s> Well, there is at least one company that has been doing browser accessibility since 1996 and is fully involved in the WAI, both in funding and participation.  </s>
<s> questions  </s>
<s> Hi, Getting accessibility into HTML 4.0 was an excellent accomplishment.  </s>
<s> I think the next major goal needs to be getting accessibility into browsers.  </s>
<s> Many of the accessibility issues for web pages result from browsers' being inaccessible.  </s>
<s> In order for browsers to become accessible, the browser companies need to be recruited into participating in the browser accessibility process.  </s>
<s> What resources does WAI have?  </s>
<s> I think there are three important ones.  </s>
<s> First, there's the association with W3.  </s>
<s> The second is support of the White House and the administration.  </s>
<s> The third is money.  </s>
<s> If I remember correctly from the WAI launch last year, WAI was going to be given several hundreds of thousands of dollars for each of the next couple of years.  </s>
<s> I'm figuring there's probably a fair amount of money available.  </s>
<s> From what I understand, Judy is the only staff person for WAI.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any announcements for grant applications or awarding of grants.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that WAI has been many sponsoring conferences.  </s>
<s> So, there's probably a fair amount of money available unless W3 or MIT get hefty cuts.  </s>
<s> I wonder if there are some creative ways to use the power of the White House and some of the WAI funds to recruit browser companies into the browser accessibility process.  </s>
<s> A simplistic idea would be to set up an afternoon meeting at the White House for CEO's of browser companies and use some WAI money to fly them in.  </s>
<s> The White House could convey the importance of getting accessibility into browsers so that regulations aren't needed.  </s>

<s> addressing scott's comments below: Not all the browser companies are US based - Opera, which has addressed many accessibility issues, and overall done well, is Norwegian.  </s>
<s> Arachne, which is currently pretty poor on accessibility, is from the Czech republic.  </s>
<s> And not all the world is convinced that lunch on the white house lawn means anything much at all.  </s>
<s> South East Asia is a rapidly growing market, full of people with disabilities caused by war and its aftermath, and Vietnam, to take an example, got its first Service Providers online last December.  </s>
<s> Perhaps providing more information on who is a good guy and who is a bad guy would be helpful for some companies.  </s>
<s> In places where central planning and regulation play a larger role (European countries would be examples here) the problem may not be as severe, although I don't have any idea.  </s>
<s> I think software people are by and large aware of the ideas, but most of them are market-driven, so until there is market demand for products which support accessibilty inherently, rather than as an add-on, those products are not likely to have a big impact on the web overall.  </s>
<s> One way to do this is the regulatory approach.  </s>
<s> Another is for people to boycott sites which do not provide accessibility.  </s>
<s> And another way is to wait until enough people can't get access, and simply point out to the content providers that they are missing out on a substantial slice of the market.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile RMIT University Melbourne Australia (on theother hand, if they'd fly me to the US for a few days it might be pretty nice ;)  </s>
<s> Hi, Charles, you have a good point.  </s>
<s> Please forgive my US-centrism of browser developers.  </s>
<s> Another idea might be to find a luminary from the software industry who WAI could hire in some evangelist capacity.  </s>
<s> This evangelist would have the respect needed to open doors and handle the software lingo.  </s>
<s> An ideal candidate would be one who has some personal stake in access issues, e.g. a close relative with a disability.  </s>
