<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> My interest - writing B2B and general IT components using XML and XML-Schema to glue them together in an open and discoverable way.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we could establish some use cases for an in-DOM XPath implementation?  </s>
<s> I thought the article on RAX (http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/04/26/rax/index.html) made a good point - not so much the memory requirement, which doesn't apply to my glue/parameter usage, but the complexity of writing simple business functions in raw DOM.  </s>
<s> I've adapted the test data, and writen some DOM level 1 code in MS JScript to do a simple query.  </s>
<s> The results were quite interesting.  </s>
<s> Here's how the query works in Windows: D:\xmlSchema tableDOM table.xml  </s>
<s> "Francis Norton" Phone=555-676767 D:\xmlSchema The first thing to note is that the query part of the program takes 15 lines of code in tableDOM.js,  </s>
<s> versus 3 lines using a hypothetical queryNodes() function in tableXpath.js.  </s>
<s> The second thing is that even with the 15 lines of code, the existing DOM code is rather less robust, and might require expansion to cope with optional Name or Path nodes, though to be fair you would probably start to write some kind of library to cope with these uses.  </s>
<s> Which would of course amount to re-inventing a small part of the xPath wheel.  </s>
<s> Francis.  </s>
<s> In case this is not generally known: // get all records var numbers = data.queryNodes("//Record[Name='"+WScript.Arguments(1)+"']/Phone");  </s>
<s> translates into: // get all records var numbers =  </s>
<s> data.selectNodes("//Record[Name='"+WScript.Arguments(1)+"']/Phone");  </s>
<s> in the current MSXML implementation.  </s>
<s> The example also exposes another problem that has been discussed recently:  </s>
<s> this code will fail if WScript.Arguments(1) contains an apostrophe.  </s>
<s> That's  </s>
<s> why I think that a well-defined API should allow to bind values to variables, and to reference these variables just like in XSLT.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> Yes. Perhaps I should have used that - the only problem is that I can't get it to work in my build of MSXML, even with "/Record[Name='" + WScript.Arguments(1) + "']/Phone/text()", which I assume is the correct expression.  </s>
<s> And it explodes any time I try to use an explicit "child::" axis.  </s>
<s> Time for another install...  </s>
<s> That seems like a good point - I could have been searching for "Patrick O'Brien".  </s>
<s> Are there any other features from XSLT which are key to the successsful use of XPath?  </s>
<s> Francis.  </s>
<s> Are there any other features from XSLT which are key to the  </s>
<s> successsful use of XPath?  </s>
<s> Now that is a key question.  </s>
<s> I've used xpath/xslt quite regardless of which I am using, in an XSLT stylesheet.  </s>
<s> I'm sure I'm going to come to a point where I want something from XSLT... unless the editors have out-thought us all :-) Which is quite possible!  </s>
<s> Can anyone think of anything immediately?  </s>
<s> Perhaps the mulberrytech quick reference card is a good starting place.  </s>
<s> It does id the functions.  </s>
<s> document() key format-number current generate-id (damn, I could have used that) system-property (good candidate for use?  </s>
<s> Or not necessary since we could operate from java with good access to system properties anyway) element-available and function-available.  </s>
<s> From a brief scan, all other stuff seems to be focussed on the output side.  </s>
<s> My only candidate then would be generate-id(), and this only to provide an identifier for a particular node, which I'm sure could be done some other way.  </s>
<s> Is there anything in dom2 that does this sort of thing?  </s>
<s> (From memory, there is a function which gets a hash code isn't there?  </s>
<s> I don't have the DOM docs to hand) Regards, DaveP  </s>

<s> If you need XPath rather than the IE5-XSL-Pattern-Language, you will have to tell MSXML(3) to do that: xml.setProperty ("SelectionLanguage", "XPath");  </s>
<s> I think this is it -- we need to bind variables and possibly extension functions (MSXML already allows to pass objects to XSLT, and then to access these objects using xsl:value-of and a user name space)..  </s>
