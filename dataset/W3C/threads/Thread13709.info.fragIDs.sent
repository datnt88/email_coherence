Dear Annotaya folks... 
As marja pointed out [1] (thanks marja!) there's work we're doing in the Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair Tool group (WAI-ER) [2] that's closely related to annotea. 
It's called EARL [3] (Evaluation And Repair Language) which annotates web pages (or web sites) with RDF statements related accessibility (e.g. ALT text for an image is judged inaccurate; reading order of this group of elements doesn't make sense, etc.). 
So I'd like to welcome you to join our EARL discussions at the face to face in boston. 
The agenda is at [4], The general EARL discussion will be Thursday Morning, 8:30-10:30. 
This is followed by a break, and there may be further discussion of EARL afterwards, depending on other issues. 
We'll also be getting into nitty gritty EARL issues in breakout sessions Friday, 10:45-3. 
If this is longer than you can spend, it would be better for us if you were there in the beginning, say before the 10:30 break, so what you say can inform the rest of the discussion. 
Hope you can make it!

I will be happy to join you for this discussion. 
Thank you for the kind invitation. 
And thank you in advance for joining us. 
I'm really looking forward to hearing from people how have thought about, and implemented, something so close to what we're talking about!
