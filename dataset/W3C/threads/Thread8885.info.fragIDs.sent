<s> Hi, I'd like to know what interoperability there has benn between independent implementations of KeyInfo types other than KeyValue and RetrievalMethod.  </s>
<s> In particular, has there been such interoperation for X509Data, PGPData, or SPKIData and if so with what subelement or elements?  </s>
<s> Also for KeyName, are there two implementations which have agreed on  </s>
<s> some particular interpretation for some KeyName values and interoperated?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Donald  </s>

<s> Hi Donald,  </s>
<s> The RetrievalMethod example from the last interop points at  </s>
<s> an X509Data containing X509SubjectName, X509IssuerSerial and  </s>
<s> X509Certificate. Clearly the certificate worked, as that is  </s>
<s> where the verification key was retrieved.  </s>
<s> As for the other bits, what are the criteria for interop?  </s>
<s> Successful parsing?  </s>
<s> Is it important (from the perspective of having XMLDSIG successfully advanced along standards tracks) to have hard interop on these other features?  </s>

<s> I then attach, for your pleasure, an archive containing a few signatures that exercise:  </s>
<s> KeyName RetrievalMethod[rawX509Certificate] X509Certificate  </s>
<s> X509SubjectName X509SKI X509IssuerSerial X509CRL  </s>
<s> Instructions for validating these are provided in an enclosed Readme.txt.  </s>
<s> We've exercised DSAKeyValue and RSAKeyValue often, and I think we agree that MgmtData is reasonably safe.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid that I cannot, however, accomodate PGP and SPKI data in the time available to me.  </s>
<s> If anyone can validate any or all of these, that would be great.  </s>
