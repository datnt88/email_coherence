<s> Guys, I started drafting a new version of the MT to reflect our staked-down decision that literals always denote themselves.  </s>
<s> This simplifies (and clarifies) the graph syntax and the basic MT, but it could be done in several different ways, so I wonder if anyone has any strong views on any of the following question: should we allow literals to entail bnodes ?  </s>
<s> At present, a graph entails its existential generalization which is gotten by 'erasing' urirefs into bnodes, eg ex:Jenny ex:age what:ever .  </s>
<s> |= ex:Jenny ex:age _:x .  </s>
<s> Do we want this to be true for literals as well?  </s>
<s> Eg should this be a valid inference?  </s>
<s> ex:Judy ex:age "10" .  </s>
<s> |= ex:Judy ex:age _:x .  </s>
<s> It seems to me that we should do this, since there is no doubt that literals do denote something - themselves, in fact - in any interpretation.  </s>
<s> This means that the following inference would be valid, for example:  </s>
<s> ex:Jenny ex:age "10" .  </s>
<s> |= ex:Jenny ex:age _:y .  </s>
<s> which might seem a bit worrying if there was an rdfs:drange assertion around, eg ex:age rdfs:drange xsd:number  </s>
<s> which imposes the 'lexical' datatype in the first case, but looks like it might impose the 'value' in the second case; but in fact it is OK, since that conclusion would only trigger the value datatyping constraint if the bnode were also the subject of rdfs:dlex; and that in turn would require the original graph to have had something like this in it: ex:Jenny ex:age "10" .  </s>
<s> "10" rdfs:dlex "12" .  </s>
<s> which is so crazy that no-one should be surprised if it has crazy  </s>
<s> entailments, right?  </s>
<s> Anyway, if y'all agree that we should accept this inference, then I think the simplest way to re-do the MT is to simply say up-front that *all* RDF interpretations must include *all* literals in their universe.  </s>
<s> Then we can just say that for literals E, I(E) = E, and not  </s>
<s> talk about things like LV and XL at all.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have any philosophical objections to this?  </s>
<s> It would allow quite a few of the lemmas to be stated with fewer qualifications, and the proofs to be simplified.  </s>

<s> yes.  </s>
<s> It is in our "swap" software.  </s>
<s> I can make test cases if anybody likes.  </s>
<s> right.  </s>
<s> yup; that seems straightforward.  </s>

<s> indeed, assuming that rdfs:drange only imposes datatype checking on literals  </s>
<s> I fully agree  </s>
<s> no objection, just praise  </s>
<s> Jos  </s>
<s> Absolute agreement.  </s>
<s> I sent something like this to the list ages ago: see which demonstrates how you can do tidy literals and support XSD datatypes - (and you'd probably implement it using something akin to jena's pair mechanism).  </s>

<s> Good to be thinking about this and collecting data.  </s>
<s> A couple of suggestions: o don't do too much work on it till we datatypes fully nailed; some issues did surface at the f2f.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid they are not done yet :( o great to ask such clear questions, but best to wait for a collective group decision before implementing them Brian  </s>
