<s> We never experimented the building of Amaya without editing functions, but it should work.  </s>
<s> You need to remove a large majority of functions declared in EDITOR.A (all menu entries disabled by the browser mode).  </s>
<s> Normally functions located within EDITORactions.c, HTMLedit.c,  </s>
<s> EDITimage.c,  </s>
<s> HTMLpresentation.c, HTMLbook.c could be removed.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Amaya *is* an editor with some browsing capabilities, not a browser with some editing capabilities!  </s>
<s> If you want to browse valid, well written, pure HTML, I'd suggest Lynx.  </s>
<s> If you want to browse real life broken HTML with shockwave/javascript/vbscript/java/frames without fallback text,....., I'd suggest IE5, although if you are not on Windows or Solaris, maybe Netscape 4, upgrading to NS5 as soon as it is realeased.  </s>
