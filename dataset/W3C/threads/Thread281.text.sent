Hi, As far as I can tell html-tidy doesn't seem to handle two columns of nested tables. 
I passed it over one doc and it produced a staggered set ... from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Am I doing something wrong here? 
Cheers John ah, also it picks up img tags and declares no "alt"s have been used when the img tag is used as "background=" in a td . 
That's bogus. 
Hi John I did not experience any such difficutlties. 
One commmon problem with nested tables occurs when the author omits the optinoal end tags. 
If this is not the reason of your problem, please provide the URL of the page tidy has problems with. 
Depends on your point of view. 
The W3C HTML 4.x standards defines alt as being a required attribute for any kind of image. 
When tidy parses your document, it tries to associate the most appropriate HTML standard to your document and follows that standards requirements. 
So if tidy parses your document as HTML 4.0, tidy does not care whether that standard is bogus or not, it just follows it. 
BTW: you can define the standard your document follows with the Doctype declaration at the top of your document. 
Hope this helps, Cheers alex Hi!

If you are using an img element for a table cell, why is it bogus to give people who can't see it an explanation of what they are missing? 
If it is only cosmetic, you should set alt="" as missing out the alt attribute will just confuse people using text-only browsers. 
Could you please send me examples of the source markup that demonstrates these two problems?

Aha, OK, I validated the doc and it seems that according to a strict reading of the w3 stuff, you cannot nest tables (well, that's my reading). 
I also noticed that "background=" in a td seems to be a browser thing. 
It all brings up an interesting point about validators/tidiers. 
It would be nice to have something that said... line xxx "background=" in td browser x, browser y only etc.. 
I can see that people might not want to write or keep updating such a thing tho. 
Cheers John quoting Bjoern Hoehrmann: Re: nice to have browser indicator... 
One of the web browsers does that I think - goes through a web page and tries to provide an indicator of what features match what browsers. 
Unfortunately, I've looked at so many of these things I don't recall which one it is. 
I know I've used w3c (and that's not the one), Bobby (which may be the one) and NetGarage (I think it is called). 
Check over on Yahoo, which is where I generally go to get the latest URLs for these kinds of sites.

- - quoting Alexander Biron: I'm not quite sure what you mean by "optional end tags" ... My reading of the w3 stuff (after I validated) suggested that nested tables weren't a Good Thing and so the output of html tidy was perfectly valid ... but not useful. 
The URL is http://www.crosswinds.net/~linuxmusic/index.html pay no mind to all the font stuff - dreamweaver did that on one trip into it and I haven't cleared it up yet Yes, that's fair enough. 
It's just that most (all?) graphical browsers won't display the "alt" so maybe it's not bogus - but it is redundant in that case. 
Hmm, I tried 4.00 transitional but the validator said I wasn't using that :( Cheers John I thought that on my copy of Netscape Communicator 4.x, when I have images turned off, the alt text information was displayed... Larry W. Virden URL: mailto:lvirden@cas.org
