<s> aloha, david!  </s>
<s> thanks for posting the URL for the curtis chung interview on slashdot... at the risk of violating several international copyright conventions, here's some of the content from: i took a listen to the questions which have already been posted, in an attempt to ascertain the accessibility awareness level of the self-proclaimed gear-heads and nerds who populate slashdot, and who happened across, or who were attracted to the posted topic: quote This week's interview guest is Curtis Chung, Director of Technology for the National Federation of the Blind, the group that is suing AOL over access for blind users.  </s>
<s> Chung is a bona fide expert on computer use by the blind; he's blind himself, and before he took his current job he spent 17 years "...with American Express as a designer/consultant, providing technical support for mainframe and mid range communication and operating system software."  </s>
<s> So ask away.  </s>
<s> One question per post, please.  </s>
<s> 10 - 15 selected questions will be forwarded to Curtis Tuesday.  </s>
<s> Answers will appear Friday.  </s>
<s> unquote and -- as the following representative sample illustrates -- save for the occasional legitimate question and thoughtful comment, the level of awareness (let alone sensitivity) displayed by the denizens of slashdot in the posts and comments they have submitted to curtis is disturbingly (albeit not really surprisingly) low... it will, indeed, be interesting to hear which questions curtis chooses to answer... what follows is less a digest, than a to-do list for the Education and Outreach Working Group!  </s>

<s> on Monday December 06, @11:50AM EST (#60) (User Info) One of the reasons I've read for the lawsuit (and for suing AOL in particular) are that AOL is SO widespread and offers such a service to its users that blind people and others feel unfairly shut out by AOL's failure to comply with ADA.  </s>
<s> But where do you draw the line?  </s>
<s> I ask this two ways: 1)What exactly of or within AOL must be made compliant to satisfy NFB's claim?  </s>

<s> Will they generally have to get as big as AOL, or does joe-schmoe.com have to become compliant the minute he offers an Amazon associate program?  </s>
