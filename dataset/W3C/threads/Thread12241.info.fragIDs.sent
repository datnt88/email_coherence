<s> PJ: Either way, we need to define the terms "presentation markup" and "structural markup" and give examples of such markup [we don't currently in either the glossary nor the techniques].  </s>
<s> CMN I agree that we should define these.  </s>
<s> A suggestion: PJ's changes to CMN's suggestions: Presentation markup [Markup language] such as [CSS] used to encode information about the desired presentation or layout of the content.  </s>
<s> [CSS], for example, can be used to control fonts and positioning.  </s>
<s> Presentation markup should not be used incorrectly to present or layout information to resemble structural content.  </s>
<s> For example, [CSS] or [HTML40] should not be used incorrectly to visually layout information to resemble a list with out also using the [structural markup] for a list.  </s>
<s> Structural markup [Markup language] such as [HTML40] used to encode information about the structural role of elements of the content.  </s>
<s> For example, headings, sections, members of a list, and components of a complex diagram can be identified using structural markup.  </s>
<s> Structural markup should not be used incorrectly to control presentation or layout.  </s>
<s> For example, [HTML40] should not be used incorrectly to achieve an indentation visual layout effect by using the quote element.  </s>
<s> Structural markup should be used correctly to communicate the roles of the elements of the content and [presentation markup] should be used separately to control the presentation and layout.  </s>
<s> Issue 7) Checkpoint 5.1 PJ: the three terms are all the same to me, functions, features, or functionalities.  </s>
<s> But adding "user interface" is limiting.  </s>
<s> I read the current wording to be more than just the natural integration into the user interface of the tool, but also into the way the tool works inside, or the plumbing (non UI) components of the tool.  </s>
<s> CMN I read it the same way, which is why I support using User interface -  </s>
<s> it is not important to the end user how the tool is built (except as a product differentiation - a well-built tool is generally more efficient than a badly-built one), only how the user interface works.  </s>
<s> PJ I agree that it is not as important to the user how the tool is built, but how the user interface works.  </s>
<s> But, since these guidelines are written to developers, it is important to write to developers who may at times think of the UI as separate from the supporting plumbing that supports the UI.  </s>
<s> By using the term "user interfaces" the developer reading the document  </s>
<s> may not think of the required functions and features [functionalities is not a word in my dictionary] that also need to be implemented to comply with the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill  </s>
<s> In other words, are you arguing that the ambiguity in the present wording is  </s>
<s> going to be beneficial to developers who are thinking about how to implement?  </s>
<s> In actual fact, the more I think about it, the more I think that we should be explicit about the requirement in the text of the checkpoint, since if it is integrated in the "plumbing" but not in the User Interfce that could be sen to have met the checkpoint while it completely fails to satisfy the actual requirement.  </s>

<s> And not all UI requires additional plumbing.  </s>
<s> So by "not limiting" the requirement to UI, or in other words, not inserting the phrase "user interface:, it implies both the UI and the plumbing are required.  </s>

<s> not explicitly state that both are _required_?  </s>
<s> an implication doesn't conveys the same weight or authority that an explicit statement carries... if that is what is meant, why not simply state it?  </s>

<s> why  </s>
<s> I believe we are by the existing wording "into the tool".  </s>
<s> When I read 10 Dec draft of both the Guideline 5 and the checkpoint 5.1, it is clear to me that it is "the tool", the overall look and feel, all parts of the tool, the UI, the documentation, the plumbing, the on-line help, etc. .  </s>
<s> . . the tool.  </s>
<s> Why limit it to just the "user interface"?  </s>
<s> or explicitly expand it to include everything included in a tool?  </s>
<s> Guideline 5. Integrate accessibility solutions into the overall "look and feel" 5.1 Ensure that functions related to accessible authoring practices are naturally integrated into the tool.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> aloha, phil!  </s>
<s> i agree that you and i and probably most -- if not all -- of the WG agrees that the current wording of 5.1 covers both the plumbing and the UI itself, but clarity on this point, i feel, would strengthen the checkpoint, and reduce the potential for mis-interpretation... if the WG doesn't feel that it is necessary to clarify the checkpoint, however, i do believe that we should at least add some verbiage to the introductory text to GL5 to make it as clear as possible that both the UI and the underlying plumbing are being addressed in this GL... just my 2 cents, gregory.  </s>

<s> GJR:: "add some verbiage to the introductory text to GL5 to make it as clear as possible that both the UI and the underlying plumbing are being addressed in this GL."
