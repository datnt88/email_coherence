Hi, Could anyone recommend me a good tool for translation? 
MS Word apparently is not a choice. 
Dreamweaver dramatically slows down with a medium size document opened. 
Thanks, Dmitri. 
Hello Dimitri! 
HTML-Kit is very fast, if you have big documents. 
www.chami.com 
Amaya is sometimes a good choice, too. 
www.w3.org/amaya 
I use both of them, sometimes it?s better to edit in the source code, sometimes not. 
The "best" editor depends on what you like most.

Hello everyone, What about me I use EditPlus 2 (see http://www.editplus.com/). 
It is not a free tool unfortunately. 
Using a WYSIWYG tool for translations isn't a good idea - you may want to translate the 'alt'-text, 'title's etc. Can you tell us what are you planning to translate?
