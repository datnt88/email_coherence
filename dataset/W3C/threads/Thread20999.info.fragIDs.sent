<s> Hi, I've just upgraded to Amaya 8.3 and the improvements are such that I no longer know how to end a table and insert a paragraph between the table and the next element or end of document.  </s>
<s> If there is already a paragraph (or any of a number of other element types) there then there is no problem, but if the table is immediately followed by /body or /hr then I need to do something complicated like edit the source.  </s>
<s> What I used to do was repeatedly hit return but this just inserts new paragraphs into the current cell.  </s>
<s> TIA, Jim Wright  </s>

<s> The solution is to select the whole table with several F2 (Esc on Linux) and hit Enter.  </s>

<s> Jim, Just select the whole table and press Enter (or Return).  </s>
<s> To select the table, make any selection within the table if the cursor is not already there, and hit F2 (Windows) or Esc (Linux) a few times.  </s>
<s> Check that the table element is selected by looking at the selection message, at the bottom of the window.  </s>
<s> This is a general mechanism that allows you to create a new empty element after any other element.  </s>
<s> It may be useful in nested lists for instance.  </s>
<s> It could be faster than hitting Return repeatedly in some cases, because F2 (or Esc) do not create new elements.  </s>
<s> Only Return inserts something new.  </s>
<s> That's the mechanism you may use now to create a new row in a table: you select an existing row and you press Return, which creates a new empty element.  </s>
<s> In this case the empty element is a row, because that's the only type of element you are allowed to insert after a row.  </s>
<s> You can also do that to create a new tbody in a table.  </s>
<s> Try it.  </s>
