Hi, I've just upgraded to Amaya 8.3 and the improvements are such that I no longer know how to end a table and insert a paragraph between the table and the next element or end of document. 
If there is already a paragraph (or any of a number of other element types) there then there is no problem, but if the table is immediately followed by /body or /hr then I need to do something complicated like edit the source. 
What I used to do was repeatedly hit return but this just inserts new paragraphs into the current cell. 
TIA, Jim Wright

The solution is to select the whole table with several F2 (Esc on Linux) and hit Enter.

Jim, Just select the whole table and press Enter (or Return). 
To select the table, make any selection within the table if the cursor is not already there, and hit F2 (Windows) or Esc (Linux) a few times. 
Check that the table element is selected by looking at the selection message, at the bottom of the window. 
This is a general mechanism that allows you to create a new empty element after any other element. 
It may be useful in nested lists for instance. 
It could be faster than hitting Return repeatedly in some cases, because F2 (or Esc) do not create new elements. 
Only Return inserts something new. 
That's the mechanism you may use now to create a new row in a table: you select an existing row and you press Return, which creates a new empty element. 
In this case the empty element is a row, because that's the only type of element you are allowed to insert after a row. 
You can also do that to create a new tbody in a table. 
Try it. 
Vincent.
