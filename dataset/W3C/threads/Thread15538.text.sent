As per the request in Bug 704, paragraph to the benefits section of 3.2. 
I'm a little shy about phrases like "in the future" cause it reminds me of the "until user agents." 
So we'll have to evaluate if the benefits of the addition outweigh the reminiscences of WCAG 1.0.

Who Benefits from Guideline 3.2 (Informative) Providing consistent and predictable responses to user actions is important feedback for users. 
This lets them know that your site is working properly and encourages them to continue interacting with the content. 
When users receive an unexpected response, they might conclude that something is wrong or broken. 
Some people might become so confused they will not be able to use your site. 
Individuals who are unable to detect extreme changes in context or may not realize that the context has changed are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site. 
This applies to people in the following ways: Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual context change, such as a new window popping up, has occurred. 
In this case, warning users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that the back button no longer behaves as expected. 
Using captions to note changes in speaker is beneficial for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and who may be unable to discern changes in speaker for audio-only presentations. 
Some individuals with low vision, with dyslexia and who have difficulty interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues in order to detect extreme changes in context. 
In the future this may allow user agents to be more flexible in their presentation of content. 
Benefits could include such things as letting the user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to handle pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant changes to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or go to a different site; etc. Looks good. 
I think you can drop the "in the future" part and just say "transcoding servers and intelligent user agents" since transcoding servers already exist and, with good content, I think their use will increase. 
Also intelligent user agents.

"Transcoding servers and intelligent user agents can be more flexible in their presentation of content to the user. 
Benefits include such things as letting the user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to handle pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant changes to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or go to a different site; etc." Ok But I would like to see our examples be more compelling. 
This doesn't sound like a major access issue the way it is worded. 
If they are big problems - we should describe that and how this guideline would avoid it. 
This is ok but seems like damning with faint praise. 
(not your fault). 
Part of our final review - I would like to look over everything and do a "so what". 
Make sure that whatever is in here in the end is either really important if it is at Level 1 or important if at level 2. We'll have to see if Level 3 is 'everything else that can be useful" or not. 
But I think our examples should be strong and convincing. 
What are your thoughts?

Roberto Scano: I suggest to mantain transcoding servers and also "user agents". 
For "user agents" there is a definition (also from UAAG 1.0) and we can add a definition for "Transcoding servers" like this one (http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/gDefinition/0,294236,sid26_gci5 
15589,00.html) 
"Transcoding is a technology used to adapt computer application displays and Web content so that they can be viewed on any of the increasing number of diverse devices on the market. 
Transcoding servers and services reformat material that would otherwise have to be developed separately for display on different platforms. 
Working like an interpreter, the technology translates content to suitable formats for various platforms, regardless of protocol, application, screen size, and language used." 
I'm fine using the term user agents, but I think "transcoding server" is outdated and limited. 
Transcoding only refers to one aspect of what is possible with web services. 
--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative I really have to concur with Wendy, we should use terms that don't feel dated (but aren't fashions), and as she says transcoding is a very small part of the almost unlimited potential of web services. 
It is important that we don't limit ourselves too specifically. 
Unless there is a good reason to limit something we should give it as wide a scope as possible. 
Tom Croucher Co-founder, Netalley Networks LLP 5 I'm fine using the term user agents, but I think "transcoding server" is outdated and limited. 
Transcoding only refers to one aspect of what is possible with web services. 
Roberto Scano: Ok... so web services could be good :) I agree. 
More broadly, I think WCAG should, where appropriate, make use of terminology derived from discussion of "device independence". 
In this context I am referring to terms such as "delivery context", "adaptation mechanism" and so on. 
One of the advantages of the "device independence" documents is that a relatively small list of technical terms, used precisely, suffices to express most of the ideas in the field.
