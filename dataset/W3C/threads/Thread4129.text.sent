*Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order* Assuming that the term 'stable' means 'stable for the life of the query', it is not clear that there is any requirement that namespace declarations must always appear in the same order, or that attributes of an element must always appear in the same order. 
For documents that are dynamically generated, this requirement may be burdensome. 
Since document order is exposed to the application, I think it could cause all sorts of subtle problems if it changes during the life of a query. 
Applications are entitled to assume that the input data model is immutable, for example that sequence-deep-equal(@*, @*) will always be true.
