Gentlemen: I am completely sick of all these debates about XML literals. 
Allow me to suggest a possible solution, along the lines suggested by Peter, which will serve to resolve them without making any substantial changes to the current RDF design and to everyone's general satisfaction. 
This is a wording change to the Concepts document; I do not believe it amounts to any real change in our current design, and may be easier to follow. 
1. Concepts section 5.1 modified as follows (change starts at ***) Such content is indicated in an RDF graph using a typed literal whose datatype is a special built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral , defined as follows. 
A URI reference for identifying this datatype is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral . 
The lexical space is the set of all strings which: are well-balanced, self-contained XML data [ XML ]; correspond to exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList )[XML-XC14N] ; when embedded between an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form a document conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS] The value space is some set of entities, called XML values, which is: disjoint from the lexical space disjoint from the value space of any XML schema datatype (refer XSD) disjoint from the set of Unicode character strings (refer Unicode) in 1:1 correspondence with the lexical space. 
The exact nature of XML values is not specified. 
The lexical-to-value mapping is a 1:1 mapping from the lexical space onto the value space. 
The value of the lexical-to-value mapping The only change to the semantics document then needed is to change 'XML data' -- 'XML value' in the second RDF condition, which I have now done as an editorial change in any case.. Pat PS. Peter, I have also fixed the XML range inconsistency bug, noted in the change log, and updated the links to refer to the latest archived editor's draft of Concepts 28 July IHMC(850)434 8903 or (650)494 3973 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501(850)291 0667 cell phayes@ihmc.us

While I have sympathy for the approach suggested, I fear it moves even further away from what Martin/I18N seem to be asking for, which is that XML literals and text are more like each other, not less.

(nb Helva) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ @Cliveden, River Thames I don't think it makes any difference at all to that issue. 
But in any case, we cannot go in two opposite directions at the same time. 
Datatypes values are NOT like text. 
We could treat XML literals much more like text, but that would require us to not treat rdf:XMLliteral as a datatype. 
The WG seems to be unwilling to go in that direction. 
As long as XML literals are treated as typed literals they are not being thought of as text. 
If the result disappoints i18n, and if we feel that this is the way RDF should go, then we must simply decide to disappoint them. 
If we wish to accede to their demands, then we must choose some other way to handle XML literals. 
I no longer greatly care which we choose, but I do care that we do not spend the next 20 years vacillating one way and then the other, trying to keep everyone happy. 
It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep everyone happy.
