I think we should make clear that we are using an api model rather than a physical device model here. 
This would make our intent for the document more clear and free us from some of the ambiguity that results from the physical modality structure. 
I believe this is discussed in a response to us from brian on his last call issues? 
It becomes important when cross input modality approaches are taken and when an input mode is indirectly used such as in the case of single switch mapped to keyboard api and mouse or morse code and voice input also fall into this class if I understand things and have read the document correctly. 
Thoughts?

We are? 
But checkpoint 11.3 is about physical keys: it's a "one gesture" requirement, not an API requirement. 
The API requirement to use the keyboard API is checkpoint 6.7. 
We can discuss this further on the call today, but I believe that the "single key" parts of 11.3 are not about APIs at all. 
In fact, you might want to bind one physical key to something that requires 15 individual commands to accomplish. 
I use this in emacs all the time: keyboard macros. 
I don't think it's important to accessibility to be able to accomplish a task through one procedure call versus 15 procedure calls. 
The API requirement is simply that you can operate the user agent, not that you can do it with fewer procedure calls.

Single key bindings are exactly that. 
one key press to do what it can take several keys to accomplish. 
TThis mapping is clear. 
What is not clear to me though and I will study it further is that when we say keyboard is some places in the document, we may mean keyboard api.

And some clarification would probably be good in the document. 
Checkpoints in which "keyboard" appears (statement of checkpoint or Note or both): 1.1 (keyboard operation, not api meant) 6.7 "API for the keyboard" 7.2 "keyboard accessibility" (keyboard operation, not api meant) 7.3 "keyboard configuration" (keyboard operation, not api meant) 9.1 "with the keyboard" (not specified) 9.3 "through keyboard input alone" (not specified) Guideline 11: keyboard bindings (thus physical keyboard meant) 12.3 "keyboard bindings" - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783
