Just downloaded the latest Tidy (which we use integrated with Homesite 4.5.1), since the March version we'd been using wasn't downcasing all tags. 
I ran the latest Tidy against a test HTML file I've "tidyed" up before, and I know the original has errors such as empty tags and tables without attributes. 
I receive an error message saying that errors and warnings were found, but the TidyOut log is empty. 
Nada. 
Any suggestions?

I believe this is the same bug as documented per my EMail of 16 Jul 00 : As reported by several other people, and confirmed by myself, this is a bug introduced into the 8 Jul 00 version of Tidy. 
Fortunately, if you have the source code, the fix is quite simple : tidy.c, 
Line 898 : if (input != null) this should be : if (fp != null) Regards, Terry 
Thank you Terry. 
Nice to know we're not alone. 
Our solution has been to revert to the May 1 2000 version of Tidy (we keep several older versions). 
Can you tell us what we've lost by reverting to this older version? 
I.e., was it really worth the effort to go to the July version? 
TIA.
