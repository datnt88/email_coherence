Looking at: I think it looks good. 
I am looking at the Features and Implementations section: Jena has support for both Collections and Reification; I would suggest you specifiy Jena2. 
I believe it is valuable to have, possibly as an ancilliary appendix in a separate file, a table of all out tests with the specified systems, showing which systems past which tests. 
This requires some format to exchange test results - given that we have not specified one, I wonder whether a plain text format might be easiest. 
(There is also EARL but we have not suggested this in the past, and I suspect that would put an obstacle in the way: I believe that we still have proposed tests that have not been approved (tex-01 and xmlsch-02) It may be useful to provide a zip of all our parser tests, and a zip of all out entailment tests. 
Possible critical path activities: + approving tex-01 xmlsch-02 and any other outstanding tests + defining a test result format (maybe splitting the tests into parser tests and entailment tests) + requesting implmentator feedback Jeremy 
small but significant: "Dissenting Opinion: Datatypes Whilst there is broad consensus on the current drafts ..." change "broad consensus" to something like "considerable support" or "broad agreement" or some such. 
Don't confuse things by talking about 'consensus' while reporting dissenting opinions.

Switched to "broad agreement".
