<s> Are the inference rules for static analysis normative or non-normative?  </s>
<s> In other words, are all implementations of static analysis requierd to follow the static inference rules as specified in the formal semantics spec?  </s>
<s> Suppose that I construct a static inference engine that takes full advantage of backward axes.  </s>
<s> That engine would create types narrower than those created by the static inference rules in the formal  </s>
<s> semantic spec.  </s>
<s> Is that engine non-conformant?  </s>
<s> This would be very unforunate.  </s>

<s> Dear Murata-San Since we have not yet finalized the conformance section, we have not yet a full answer to your question.  </s>
<s> The latest discussion was that the static analysis is normative as a lower-bound and implementations could infer more precise types.  </s>
<s> What is needed for conformance, I don't know yet.  </s>
<s> I personally find the loss of type information on backwards-axes to be problematic as well.  </s>
<s> If you would like to propose more precise inference rules, I am sure we will look at them and see if we can/want to incorporate them.  </s>
<s> Thanks Michael  </s>

<s> "Michael, Thank you for your prompt answer.  </s>
<s> I feel that use of backwards-axes for type inference requires an approach significantly different from that of the formal semantics spec.  </s>
<s> Such an approach may sometimes lead to tighter types and sometimes lead to looser types.  </s>
<s> So, I feel uneasy to have normative rules for type inference.  </s>
