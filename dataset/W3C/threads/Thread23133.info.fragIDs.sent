<s> Hi, I've revieved the DOM3 Load &amp; Save Last Call spec [1] for the XForms WG and have the following Last Call comments: 1. Inconsistency in DOMParserFilter Inconsistency: 1.1 says DOMParserFilter filters only elements, while 1.3 says all kinds of nodes (e.g. attributes and text nodes) can be filtered.  </s>
<s> Which is right?  </s>
<s> The preferred answer is that of 1.3.  </s>
<s> Please fix this in the spec.  </s>
<s> 2. Inconsistency in DOMSerializerFilter Inconsistency: 1.1 says DOMSerializerFilter can be used to filter out nodes, but 1.3 says that only elements can be filtered.  </s>
<s> Why doesn't this interface include attributes?  </s>
<s> An example of a use case: in XForms the 'relevant' attribute can be set to false on a attribute, which removes it from the serialization.  </s>
<s> Please fix this so that also attributes and text nodes can be filtered out.  </s>
<s> 3. 1.4 Convenience Interfaces should be made mandatory Why are these interfaces optional?  </s>
<s> If the claim is right that they are just convenience methods, they should be trivial to implement.  </s>
<s> For users it will be a pain to check whether an implementation supports these interfaces.  </s>
<s> Please fix this by making them mandatory.  </s>
<s> [1] DOM3 LS  </s>
<s> 1.3 is correct, fixed in the spec now.  </s>
<s> Good catch!  </s>
<s> jst  </s>
<s> Fixed. Attribute nodes are now passed to the filter, except for namespace declaration attributes and default attributes.  </s>
<s> jst  </s>
<s> The DOM WG disagrees with this, and chose to not make these interfaces mandatory.  </s>
<s> However, the DOM WG also decided to completely drop these interfaces from the LS spec, please see: for more details.  </s>
