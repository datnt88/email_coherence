Version: 6.0.314 / Virus Database: 175 - Release Date: 11-01-02 All -- Pardon the OT. Eric -- Actually, the AVG software does scan outgoing attachments. 
From AVG's documentation: ? 
Incoming Mail- if the AVG E-mail Scanner detects incoming mail with attachments infected by a virus, it removes the infected files automatically and puts them into the AVG Virus Vault . 
? 
In the body of the offending e-mail, a message is inserted to inform you about the virus threat. 
? 
Outgoing Mail- if the AVG E-mail Scanner detects outgoing mail attachments infected by a virus, it stops the message from being sent. 
The entire message will be returned to the sender marked undeliverable. 
? 
Text will be inserted into the offending e-mail informing the sender it was refused because it contained a virus. 
AVG also (for some mail clients) inserts a certification in outgoing mail (see below) stating that the mail has been scanned, not only assuring your correspondents, but providing a curious example of *viral* marketing ;-) Regards, Peter Hollings LARGER SERVER.
