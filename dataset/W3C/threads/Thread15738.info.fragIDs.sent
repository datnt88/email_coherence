Adobe And TRACE Launch Enhanced PDF Access Via Email --New service enables conversion via email attachments (http://access.adobe.com) 
Adobe Systems and the TRACE Research Center are happy to announce a new service to enhance the accessibility of PDF documents to visually impaired users. 
Ever since we launched our popular server-based accessibility solutions on http://access.adobe.com in March 1997, the single most oft voiced request has been the need to convert PDF documents on a local disk or CDROM to ASCII or HTML. 
In response, we have set up a a conversion service hosted by the TRACE Research Center (http://trace.wisc.edu). 
You can send PDF documents as email attachments to: pdf2txt@sun.trace.wisc.edu -- for plain text pdf2html@sun.trace.wisc.edu -- for HTML and receive the result of the conversion in the reply. 
Adobe would like to thank Dr. Gregg Vanderheiden and the TRACE Research Center for helping us host this service. 
Attached is a summary of accessibility services provided by Adobe. 
Our WWW site (http://access.adobe.com) has been revised in conjunction with the launch of this new service; please take a momement to visit us and refresh your bookmarks. 
--Raman (and the access.adobe.com 
team) 
Welcome To Access At Adobe! Please visit http://access.adobe.com 
This page is your launching point for learning more about universal access to Adobe products. 
The primary focus at present is enhancing the accessibility of PDF. 
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a platform-independent means of exchanging visually rich documents. 
PDF is fast becoming a pervasive means of communicating richly formatted information on electronic networks including the Internet and its most popular segment, the World Wide Web (WWW). 
PDF documents are rich in visual layout, and are popular among users capable of appreciating the high-fidelity visual presentation. 
However, visually impaired users have found PDF documents hard to access. 
Conventional screen reading technologies ---software that enables a visually impaired user listen to the contents of a computer display--- prove ineffective when reading the rich visual presentation. 
In the last two years, Adobe has been working on a platform-independent solution aimed at enhancing the accessibility of PDF to visually impaired users on diverse computing platforms. 
This new strategy relies on standard WWW protocols and clients to bring PDF accessibility to the standard HTML browser that users already use for surfing the WWW. 
We have implemented a PDF2HTML translator that converts textual content from PDF documents to HTML. 
You can now use this conversion technology to more readily access PDF documents using your favorite WWW browser and screen access application. 
1) You can submit a URL to any PDF file you wish to read using an interactive WWW form. 
The document will be converted to HTML and presented in your WWW browser. 
2) You can mail a URL to a PDF document in the body of an email message to pdf2txt@adobe.com (for plain text) or to pdf2html@adobe.com and have the convertor mail back the result of translating the PDF file. 
3) You can mail a URL to a PDF document or attach the PDF document itself as a MIME attachment in the body of an email message to pdf2txt@sun.trace.wisc.edu 
(for plain text) or to pdf2html@sun.trace.wisc.edu and have the convertor mail back the result of translating the PDF file. 
For a detailed description of these accessibility services, read Note: All of these services are based on tools I developed for my own use at Adobe; I have been using these tools on a daily basis for over nine months now and find them indispensable for my work. 
I hope they are equally helpful to readers on this list.

team) Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. 
If this is what people want, then it is doubtless a good thing that you have made it available. 
IMHO: 1) Far too many web authors favor form over content and that PDF facilitates this. 
PDF is reminiscent of frames -- another bad idea that just won't go away. 
2) The majority of PDF documents don't use the available features (like thumbnails 
and bookmarks). 
The most common rational for the use of PDF is to force multiple columns (an okay idea in print, a lousy idea on the screen). 
A document's file 
size is increased by roughly a factor of ten (over the plain text version). 
The cost/benefit ratio of PDF is extremely poor, so much so that it must be obvious, even to dunderheads. 
3) The form-based tool is compatible with Lynx and the Access plug-in for the Acrobat Reader works with screen readers. 
The conversion algorithm has the same flaws in any case as the email version. 
I am curious about where my logic is flawed. 
I've read the Adobe propaganda, and I must confess that I just don't get it. 
In my web-surfing experience, PDF are becoming less common (thank goodness). 
I understand that PDF predates HTML and that some important sites are wedded to the PDF concept (usually sites that see their mission as providing print resources and not information). 
I don't understand why the request for email conversion was so popular. 
Doubtless this has all been debated before. 
I do not want to generate a lot of traffic on this news group about this issue. 
I would like to be directed to resources that address my questions and concerns. 
Is there a news group dedicated to PDF? Better yet would be a web site that is not run by Adobe. 
Best would be an archive (of discussion threads) where those of us who are new to the PDF vs HTML debate can go to get up to speed. 
Thanks.

I have found PDF to be an asset - when used right. 
I can deliver a document that can be seen AND PRINTED by anyone with the viewer. 
This can 
deliver technical and graphical documents and display tables, graphs, and graphics. 
I have had to prepare and post many technical documents while maintaining content and security and this was the easiest solution. 
See 
blessing. 
We received multiple formats and were able to post to the web with ease. 
At that time the HTML authoring tools were ancient. 
Though they have improved, I do not wish to think of the mess if I still had to put these up in HTML. 
Oh, I could post them in HTML and make graphics out 
of the images and tables... But I could not guarantee they would print right! 
PDF has its uses! 
Please note, at the time of the documents' creation, WAI was not well known. 
If I had to do it all over, I would still convert the files to PDF 
and post, but then I would also then convert to HTML and post. 
We used the bookmarks and thumbnail. 
We would not use it for every file as 
this increase the file size.

Dear Robert, I have found your contributions to this group most enlightening, so please don't take this wrong, but I would argue that the site you reference (Joint Warfare System) is an example of BAD AND INAPPROPRIATE use of the Portable Document Format! 
I could not find any compelling reason why the hard copy printing was of critical importance for the documents you cite. 
Flat PDF creation can be very easy for the authors of print documents. 
This is 
just about its ONLY virtue. 
Given that one has purchased the right (somewhat expensive) utilities, one can publish PDF in the same manner as printing. 
Graphical charts, diagrams, pictures, etc. take about the same bandwidth and work whether they are rendered as GIFs or PostScript. 
PDF bookmarks add little 
overhead to the file size, but require effort (and are more difficult than internal HTML links). 
Of course, if an author was thinking of the reader, s/he would be probably be writing in HTML in the first place! 
In the few files I 
sampled, the JWARS authors don't bother with bookmarks. 
The ONLY thing JWARS gains from PDF is consistent page numbering from their web documents to print 
documents. 
The guarantee of "printing right" is illusionary in any case: what if the person is using a poor quality printer, the wrong size paper, or monochrome for a color document? 
I have seen two justifications for PDF that are (somewhat) better than your example: 1) The transmission of print forms (e.g., an IRS 1040). 
That is, documents that are printed locally, filled out (by hand), and then SNAIL MAILED back to the source (where they would, no doubt, be data processed). 
2) The transmission of sensitive (e.g., protected by copyright) works to members (e.g., college students) by an institution. 
The document could be posted to a public site, but would only be useable to those who had the secret password (since PDF files can be encrypted). 
Without getting into the realm of accessibility, there are severe flaws with the above rationalizations for the use of PDF. 
It is twice as much work to do both HTML and PDF, so, if you had to do it all over, why would you bother with PDF? Do you think the quality is that much improved? 
(If this is the case, I would argue that you need to take another look at your HTML documents!) Is the person who is doing it now aware of the ADA legal requirement to make electronic documents accessible? 
PDF is NOT accessible. 
Adobe's actions are a stop-gap measure designed to delay legal action. 
I could not find HTML versions of most document in the JWARS library. 
Robert, I realize that you have moved, but does your replacement know his responsibilities? 
Would it help if we in the W3C WAI pestered him? 
Can ANYONE reference a GOOD AND APPROPRIATE use of PDF files? 
[Deleted.] 
I have found your contributions to this group most enlightening, Rob thanks so please don't take this wrong, but I would argue that the site you reference (Joint Warfare System) is an example of BAD AND INAPPROPRIATE use of the Portable Document Format! 
Rob Disagree, what is your definition of GOOD and APPROPRIATE? 
PDF offers better security than a read only file. 
If you are in the middle of a solicitation, you can lock your documents so they can be printed but not altered. 
We also built in house forms with PDF and found them to be useful, especially if we want to put tags and buttons for viewing and printing. 
It all comes down to your needs, cost and timeline! 
Adobe Acrobat provides many tools to solve many solutions. 
I am satisfied with the decision to use Adobe product. 
This was GOOD and APPROPRIATE for us! 
I could not find any compelling reason why the hard copy printing was of critical importance for the documents you cite. 
ROB In the technical environment, contractors are normally required to produce hard copies for the client. 
In addition, the web provided the user group with hard copies to review and edit. 
I have many years of experience generating documents and manuals for the hardware and software engineering environment. 
Now that more information is available on the web, there are many of us who prefer the hardcopy, because our eyes are tired or old!!! Plus I can read it on the train or flight.. 
Therefore, print is very important! 
Most of these files were generated in MS OFFICE and other file formats. 
Several of the documents came from multiple sources. 
In this case, it is far easier to generate one file. 
Also when designing for a web site the most important issue is know your primary audience and in this case, it was a highly technical audience. 
At the time WAI was unknown. 
Flat PDF creation can be very easy for the authors of print documents. 
This is just about its ONLY virtue. 
Rob Disagree and consider this to be a FLAME to PDF. 
Given that one has purchased the right (somewhat expensive) utilities, Rob Acrobat Reader is freeware. 
Acrobat Exchange is the product you need to convert the file to PDF. 
At the time, the cost benefit proved it was better to buy it! 
one can publish PDF in the same manner as printing. 
Rob Huh? 
Not sure understand your point. 
You can convert files to PDF via the print command, but you select PDF Writer or Print to File and Distill it. 
Its easy. 
Graphical charts, diagrams, pictures, etc. take about the same bandwidth and work whether they are rendered as GIFs or PostScript. 
Rob Disagree. 
This takes more time to generate from multiple documents or a WORD document. 
The workflow is to cut and paste, convert to a GIF or JPEG and test. 
The file size of the graphics we had would be quite large. 
Albeit today there is a Powerpoint to HTML converter, but the images become large GIFs and need to handled properly. 
PDF is an easier way to go. 
Have also used VISIO Professional to convert images, works well but you may need to tweak in Photoshop. 
PDF bookmarks add little overhead to the file size, but require effort (and are more difficult than internal HTML links). 
Rob Disagree, it depends how they are used. 
Of course, if an author was thinking of the reader, s/he would be probably be writing in HTML in the first place! 
Rob Again, depends on you environment and how much time you have. 
The project was producing large technical documents and engineers writing in HTML does not make sense. 
Besides, this is not their purpose! 
By your remark, then ever office should be writing in HTML. 
However, HTML is not as powerful for WORD and HTML Web authoring tools arent there yet! 
In the few files I sampled, the JWARS authors don't bother with bookmarks. 
Rob File size was already too large on most documents before we started. 
I did not want to make them so they would take longer to download. 
We also did not have time to bookmark each file. 
This was laborsome and did not see the need to purchase automated tools for this. 
The ONLY thing JWARS gains from PDF is consistent page numbering from their web documents to print documents. 
Rob Wrong. 
People from all over the world were able to print and view what was on their screen, with a laser or a inkjet. 
No one ever complained! 
And remember your audience. 
The guarantee of "printing right" is illusionary in any case: what if the person is using a poor quality printer, the wrong size paper, Rob 8.5 x 11 in the US - or an A number in Europe. 
Besides the world is not perfect! 
If you have a problem, then you e-mail the webmaster. 
I always replied within two days! 
monochrome for a color document? 
Rob These print fine in Black and White, Look better in color! 
I always test a document AND HTML page to ensure it prints well in both color and black and white. 
I have seen two justifications for PDF that are (somewhat) better than your example: 1) The transmission of print forms (e.g., an IRS 1040). 
That is, documents that are printed locally, filled out (by hand), and then SNAIL MAILED back to the source (where they would, no doubt, be data processed). 
2) The transmission of sensitive (e.g., protected by copyright) works to members (e.g., college students) by an institution. 
The document could be posted to a public site, but would only be useable to those who had the secret password (since PDF files can be encrypted). 
Rob These are neither better or worse, rather they are the multiple ways PDF can be used! 
Without getting into the realm of accessibility, there are severe flaws with the above rationalizations for the use of PDF. 
Rob Disagree It is twice as much work to do both HTML and PDF, so, if you had to do it all over, why would you bother with PDF? Rob TO benefit our PWD brethren! 
Do you think the quality is that much improved? 
Rob For sighted people, yes. 
(If this is the case, I would argue that you need to take another look at your HTML documents!) Rob Cant speak for the people there. 
Is the person who is doing it now aware of the ADA legal requirement to make electronic documents accessible? 
PDF is NOT accessible. 
Rob Adobe is aware of the problems and is working with the WAI community to resolve. 
Remember when PDF came out, WIA was not an issue. 
PDF documents can be made accessible if converted. 
Adobe's actions are a stop-gap measure designed to delay legal action. 
I could not find HTML versions of most document in the JWARS library. 
Robert, I realize that you have moved, but does your replacement know his responsibilities? 
Rob I left before the WAI became an issue in the federal government, so I will not speak for someone else. 
However, there is a move in the Federal government to address these issues. 
And like commercial entities, people are trying to address these issues with an increasing workload and no increase in people or resources. 
Would it help if we in the W3C WAI pestered him? 
Rob I do not think that is professional. 
The site is geared toward a specific audience - technical and may not interface with PWDs. 
If I were to pester anyone, I would take the time to review Federal, State and Local web sites. 
These have a higher use of PWD than a technical site buried deep. 
Also, if you pester these people, you efforts will be noted but you may also create a hostile attitude inside DoD toward WAI. 
This is a technical web site, if you have a problem with a document, then e-mail the webmaster and ask him to provide a text version for you. 
But why do that, when you can e-mail it to Adobe and they will convert it for you. 
My personal thoughts are, why file a complaint against a Technical web site with a specific audience where the documents were created years ago and may have very little PWD traffic. 
In the latest release of maybe 508 (cant remember which one) it states something like this...the government does not have to comply if they can prove this would cause undue work and cost. 
Budgets are shrinking...pick and choose your protests carefully. 
I believe the legal advantage gained for this specific action above would hinder progress made. 
I am sure this statement will cause responses.... If anyone would like to respond, please cut this out and respond. 
Can ANYONE reference a GOOD AND APPROPRIATE use of PDF files? 
Rob It appears that you are very anti-PDF or have a different perspective from the many people who have found it to be a useful tool. 
I do not share your experiences. 
Therefore, I doubt any examples I would provide meet with your approval. 
Rob My apologies to the WAI Interest Group, but was not sure how to interpret the response. 
Hence, I felt the decency to justify my comments 
on-line. 
Bruce, if you will, if this response hasn't satisfied your remarks, please take this offline and send an e-mail to me.

well done and what I have to say will be short. 
First, Trace should be congratulated and that's what this thread started out to do. 
Adobe as well is making commendable efforts toward accessability and I believe we'll see more strides in the direction of access. 
My only reservation towards pdf at the moment is that as it is when you hit it it is inaccessible in the same way that garfield is on the washington post site. 
It doesn't matter if it can be emailed or proxied, the plain simple fact is that it takes an extra step. 
This is a fact that should be well publicisized and the use of pdf should be encouraged only after long and carefull evaluation of the situation has taken place to assure that there is no better solution and even then, in this case as with the case of a highly glitsy site, if the site will be of use to or heavily trafficed by pwds who use adaptave equipment as I do, there should be an alternative that is readily accessible. 
The day will come when the mdium will not matter. 
the rendering will take place regardless.

I don't want to start a debate here but my personal opinion is that all thse converters do as much harm as good. 
If you ask me pdf is a problematic file format at best for people that are blind. 
I recently tried to convert a batch of IRS documents and the results were disasterous. 
Yet the person at the IRS knew all about these converters and pointed me directly to them and seemed oh so very pleased that the documents would be made accessible by this convert technology. 
This is a reply to Kelly: I agree. 
Not all files are seamlessly converted. 
You need to be aware what you are converting. 
If it is a document with text, then it should be ok. 
However if it is a form, it may not convert well. 
You should test before you post! 
Does anyone know of PDF Form (where you can enter data)? 
Would like to see how these convert.

I can come up with a few: In FDA we receive stacks of paper documents from industry and citizens that can number hundreds of pages per document title. 
We scan and put these into Acrobat format, since these documents have not be supplied to us in an electronic format. 
This is the only way we can keep up with the pace of information flow. 
We have difficulty with document conversion with electronic copy as well. 
Do you know how long it takes to convert a 1000 page WordPerfect document with scientific notation into HTML? 
We have to make these documents available to the public due to the FOI Act. 
Also, most lawyers want an exact "look and feel" of a document for legal reasons. 
I prefer HTML, but it's close to impractical. 
I can convert a 25 page document into PDF in 5 minutes, while it would take 4 hours for HTML. 
Paul Stauffer staufferp@cder.fda.gov 
...a large segment of the "public" goes missing here then, and in the cases where relivant, could you provide them in zipped text format or at least wp?

Robert, Sorry to get your hackles up. 
Perhaps we should just agree to disagree. 
It feels like we are getting into an emotional (and un-resolvable) Mac vs. IBM or Navigator vs. IE debate. 
Really I am hoping to "see the light" with regard to the utility of PDF. 
I still don't get it. 
I understand that PDF could be a good in-house tool, or appropriate for a limited target audience. 
I understand that it would have been a really nice option five years ago. 
I understand that if lawyers and contracts are involved, then the hard copy print version can assume disproportionate importantance. 
(But this comes back to my original observation about groups whose perceived mandate is to provide print materials, even at the expense of providing actual information.) 
I too sometimes prefer reading print over reading the screen, and I don't care for jagged 72 dpi graphics on a 300 dpi laser printer, but I am most intolerant of the forced interruption of an extra application when I am busy browsing, and graphics can be scaled for good display on screen and in print. 
From a modern day "serve the general public" view point, I *still* cannot think of an application where PDF makes sense. 
Sure, if you already have the PDF files, making HTML is more work. 
Converting (no matter the formats) is an extra step. 
My point is that making the graphic in the first place takes a fixed amount of effort, so choose tools that are "web enabled" rather than PDF oriented. 
This is, of course, much easier now days. 
I agree about wasting bandwidth on the list. 
This must have been discussed elsewhere. 
Can anyone point me to an archive? 
Am I the only one on the WAI who does not understand the MAINSTREAM utility of PDF? 
Is your OCR sufficient that you are capturing the text of these documents or does the PDF file basically contain a PHOTOGRAPH of the the print page? 
I have seen people move print documents to the web by scanning a whole page as one large GIF file (with little or no ALT text of course)! 
Could you provide the URL where you are using this technique? 
In the relevant cases yes, but I was addressing the question that asks if PDF is necessary in any situation. 
Paul Staufer staufferp@cder.fda.gov 
Forgive the cross posting. 
It is nice when my worlds come together! 
Access to forms was a recent issue on the Resna list serv. 
I agree with Kelly about the PDF converters doing as much harm as good. 
Of course, another thread reveals that I feel that way with regard to PDF in general! 
At the vocational rehabilitation center where I work, paper forms have been a problem for years. 
This is true for folks with vision impairments but also motor and cognitive issues as well. 
In practice, getting the forms in PDF or even in the original WordPerfect (or Word) file format has not helped. 
Various clinicians have experiment with a variety of OCR form tool software, but none have been a real panacea. 
The problem with these (and with getting the form as a word processing document) is that they look okay in print, but are not designed for filling out on-screen. 
A typical example is that a line is created by the underscore character or underlined spaces. 
Typing on the "line" moves text all over the page! 
This is the simplest example, there are lots more problems with boxes, font size changes, and the like. 
Our approach has been to CAREFULLY re-create the form in the word processor so that the person using the screen reader (or other adaptive technology) can search for "INDENT" (or similar white space code) and then safely enter text without effecting the formatting of the form. 
There is still the possibility that the person will backspace one time too often (and start deleting code) and there are other hazards. 
Usually we can train around these issues. 
This is obviously a very labor intensive approach, and not a very generalizable solution to the problem. 
There are advertised products that are suppose to take paper forms and convert them into databases. 
We have not been able to make them work, especially with screen readers. 
Has anyone else had better success? 
There are some nice high-end adaptive technologies out now for dealing with paper, but they tend to be read-only mechnanisms. 
Has anyone had good sucess with the Kurtzweil Omni 1000 or Omni 3000 (www.kurzweiledu.com) 
when it comes to accessing forms? 
ok, on to forms we go. 
there are two methods that work nicely. 
use something like ms-access to create the form the other formerly popular app will do nicely too dbase I think it was called. 
then when you give out the form give it out in a runtime form so that it can be filled out just by basically tabbing around. 
annother sollution is macros. 
you can set up a form in a macro so that it can't miss. 
wp51 was great for this. 
there are I'm sure myriads of other solutions out there. it is a bulky problem to be sure.

Robert-- In general PDF forms convert okay to the extent that you get the content in the conversion-- but the form fields are not made active in the HTML. 
The biggest nightmare scenario is one where a paper form is scanned in to create an electronic version where portions are subsequently made "active form fields". 
If the creator does not take the effort to ensure that the piece of paper is being OCR-ed correctly, there is little one can do later to make the form accessible. 
From the various error reports we have received in over the 
last 18 months, the majority of PDF documents that convert poorly on some Federal WWW sites appear to have originated from an OCR-based workflow-- and things vary all over the map --from PDF files where in fact no OCR was done i.e. the page just has a scanned image -- to PDF files that were probably produced from scanned images that were not necessarily very clean-- in these cases you either see nothing in the output of the convertor (the convertor *does* *not* do OCR) or fairly poor quality text --the text is of course a direct function of the OCR results. 
These kinds of problems are particularly hard to explain to someone who is making a check-off decision on "is it accessible"-- in general this is a problem that the accessibility field faces all over the map. 
For a talk I put together on how to design accessible WWW publishing solutions using all of today's technologies including HTML, CSS and PDF (given the constraints of time, cost and user benefits) see http://cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/publications/talks/gsa-98/ 
The main point is to recognize what you point out below -- not all PDF files are created equal. 
PDF documents get created today via a number of creation paths --ranging from drawing applications to word-processors to document scanners --the mileage from the access conversion varies accordingly. 
On the one hand it's frustrating to run into a PDF document on the WWW that converts poorly and is consequently inaccessible-- but it is important to examine how those documents originated --rather than simply blaming it on the file format. 
If we walked up to the average Webmaster and said "dont published those scanned PDFs --but HTML is accessible to the blind" --the average Webmaster would simply create a bunch of scanned gifs and hook them into an HTML page. 
On the other hand, documents created from word processing applications do perform reliably when processed by the access convertor --the amount of usage the service gets bears witness to this fact. 
Finally, the purpose of the access service is not as some on this list have alleged a "attempt to pay lip service to accessibility" --it's a service that makes information accessible that would otherwise remain out of reach. 
For those with long memories, I originally raised the question of accessibility to final form content such as PDF in 1993-- at the time I was laughed off of several blindness related lists by blind users who made statements of the form "We called wordperfect and they said they would support it -- so it will be accessible to us" --and other similar foolish assertions. 
I came to Adobe in 1995 and worked on the access problem because I felt that even if I achieved 30% of what I achieved in the world of LaTeX documents (see formatting of structured documents) with PDF documents, I would have a greater impact on the amount of information that is accessible --simply because I would be making a 30% improvement to 80% of the world's documents --as opposed to a 90% improvement to about 1% of the world's documents. 
I still believe in this decision --otherwise I would not be doing what I am currently doing. 
At the time I started working on better access to PDF, I had also gotten completely disillusioned with the visual presentation slope down which HTML was sliding --look at the mess on the WWW today and you will see the realization of the nightmare I foresaw. 
All is not gloom and doom though -- the advent of XML and CSS and ACSS should help us recover some of the ground we lost. 
Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. 
Understand that my comments about the pdf file converters doing as much good as bad were in no fashion meant to be critical of the work done by those involved in the process. 
I'm sure if any usage log were examined (not implying any is kept) my email address would show up fairly often. 
From my perspective, that as someone who's trying to use the assorted documents created in pdf, there are two problems. 
The first is that which I've commented on here in the past i.e. the conversion doesn't always produce usable results. 
This is a technical problem that has all kinds of solutions that work to varying degrees. 
The larger problem is only partly technical in nature. 
Most places that distribute materials, especially forms and alike, in a pdf format still expect you to print that document and complete the material in the traditional pen and paper fashion. 
Even if the convert was flawless in reproducing the layout of the form, it is unlikely that the organization receiving the material would accept my word processed version of their form. 
I suspect that if the problem of accepting the actual results of the form in an alternative format were solved the pdf issue wouldn't be nearly as problematic. 
Much thanks to Robert Neff and Paul Stauffer. 
I'll share the good stuff (links) first and then proceed with my pontificating! 
Skeptic that I am, Paul has pointed me to a mainstream public site where PDFs 
are, in my humble opinion, good and appropriate. 
Some examples (and what happens with the Access Adobe translation): processing document and is pretty small compared to the other samples referenced.

The translation shows only the page numbers! 
No warning messages of any kind are generated. 
It is interesting to note that all of the above look similar in an Acrobat Reader window! 
The casual browser would have no way of knowing which is an image and which has text. 
A word search returns only "not found", even when 
there is no text that can be scanned! 
It was interesting to me that Access Adobe return translations to me faster than Acrobat Reader. 
This is not too surprising given that both Adobe and the 
FDA have T3 connections to the internet and I am using dial-up! 
Were the translations better, no doubt the service would be totally over whelmed by home 
users. 
I postulate that it is in Adobe's interest to keep this free service 
mediocre! 
The curious might wish to try pasting the above links through their 
simple form (http://access.adobe.com/simple_form.html). 
The Food and Drug Administration basically has to choose between providing copious PDFs or trickling out HTML. 
The documents are coming from a variety of 
sources (including paper). 
This is the kind of devil-in-the-detail choice disability rights advocates are regularly faced with. 
Do we wage the impossible war against the system (and thereby be true to our ideals, but in 
the meantime accomplish little) or work from within the system to effect change 
(and in the meantime feel compromised, and probably give up the chance for radical improvements). 
Given the current (less than acceptable) state of the 
art with regard to PDF access, which (less than ideal) goal do we pursue: 1) Purge PDF from the web with the same vigor we fight missing ALT text. 
This 
would include removing Access Adobe, since it gives the mistaken impression that there are easy work-arounds to dealing with PDF. 
Never mind the mainstream opposition we will face, nor our own brethren we will anger when what poor tools there are go away. 
Organizations like the FDA will either break or be given more money to do this aspect of their job properly. 
2) Accept the status quo. 
We should be grateful for what tools are handed us 
and we can plead for help on a case-by-case basis when they don't work. 
In the 
meantime, we can educate, much like we do with the majority of WAI issues. 
Hopefully, work on PDF translation will continue. 
I would guess that the kind 
of optical character recognition that is needed involves the same kind of artificial intelligence that is needed for understanding language and real voice recognition. 
At a minimum the Acrobat Reader (and Access Adobe) should warn the user when 
there is no text associated with the images displayed. 
I would like to Access 
Adobe offering free state of the art OCR for PDF documents.

Bruce Thanks for taking the time to evaluate portions of my site and writing an excellent evaluation. 
I can't believe how quickly the Adobe Access converter works. 
The quality of the conversions leave a lot to be desired. 
You comments definitely spur me on to do more HTML conversions. 
I'm still stuck with PDF for when I receive paper copies of documents though. 
Hopefully our future use of a document management system will give us more original source documents, which will cut down on the number of paper documents we receive. 
Paul Stauffer staufferp@cder.fda.gov 
PDFs 
three points: 1 adobe is committed to the highest level of access possible. 
2 perhaps there is a middle ground between stomping on people and accepting the status quo. 3 it is possible to work within the system and effect change and not loose heart. 
we may get discouraged from time to time, but I've not lost heart lo these many years. 
till the time comes... let's make the best use of the tools we have both for access and content production and let's talk about html xml, web navigation and the host of other things that make the web the web and work with people off list on the pdf issues. 
Thanks!

One of the nicest ways I have found of doing these, for all concerned parties, is to create an HTML form (without a submit button) Although it may require a signature, which can only be added by hand (so far as I can figure out) all the other information can be entered in a form on-screen, which allows the use of assistive technology such as screen readers, as well as enabling the writing on the form to be computer generated and legible (assuming people use a legible font on their printer). 
Trying to organise conferences where people handwrite important information in an incomprehensible scrawl made me realise the value of this technique. 
Having to produce a form which was print-and-post because a cheque or money order had to be mailed made me realise the benefits that it could provide to the people filling in the form.

I like that and also the ones that you can download and fill out and print. 
do you have an url example I can take a look at?

Sorry, I do now have a couple that are public (the ones I had in mind were for pay systems and so on, which I can't really release easily) Charles McCN 
The real point is to provide a print-and-post form (for example to go with a cheque) which is accessible. 
A blind person cannot fill out the form with a pen very easily. 
If the form is in HTML, then it can be filled out using fairly standard forms of Assistive technology. 
A basic assumption is that the minutiae of the form's layout are not critical - using a GUI browser they actually come out looking quite nice, but one of the benefits is that the information is typed rather than scrwaled, so it is fairly easy to interpret. 
The pay system I did was a bit more complex. 
Hours, employee data, and pay rates were entered into a form. 
The form was processed by the server, which checked the authorisation, antered the data into the database, calculated payment rates, and returned a table of information which had to be printed and submitted with an ink-on-paper signature. 
Again it is impossible to control the output completely, but it is presented in some reasonably legible format by any browser (if the code is properly written - I did it using Cold Fusion and SQL which allows the required flexibility)
