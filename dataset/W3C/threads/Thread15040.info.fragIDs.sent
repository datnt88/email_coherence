Hello, 
Is there an official kind of definition of a data table and a layout table? 
We have lots of discussion about that here and it seems important for the answering of the question about summary and other questions about accessibility of 'tables'. 
Kindest regards, Eric Velleman 
The WCAG2 Techniques desribe them as: "tables used to organize data, and tables used to create a visual layout of the page" This seems clear enough to me. 
Have you seen any that are ambiguous - could fit into both categories or neither category? 
Cheers, Chris

ObNitpick: From the definitions alone, it should be pointed out that a visual layout _is_ a way to organize data. 
It's just a visual way of organizing visual information.

When I'm asked to explain it I say that in a data table, there is a regular organization of cells that have a specific relationship to each other and to one or more header cells that labels or classifies the cells. 
It also helps people to understand if I say it's similar to a spreadsheet. 
In a layout table, the cells do not necessarily relate to each other in particular ways since it's the visual layout that's relevant, there isn't a relationship to header cells, and there may not be a regular structure to the table. 
I think this is the same thing as we all understand but may be helpful in making a definition for people who aren't aware of the distinction.

table? 
I found this (and I cited it in my recent book): "When tables are used to represent logical relationships among data -- text, numbers, images, etc., that information is called "tabular information" and the tables are called "data tables". 
The relationships expressed by a table may be rendered visually (usually on a two-dimensional grid), aurally (often preceding cells with header information), or in other formats." 
Perhaps not perfect, but may help.
