<s> Hello, I just skimmed the 12 January 2001 draft of WCAG 2.0 [1].  </s>
<s> The document seems to be advancing very well.  </s>
<s> I do have a couple of comments:  </s>
<s> 1) Guideline 1 reads "Design content that can be presented according to the needs and preferences of the user and to the capabilities of the user agent and the device(s)."  </s>
<s> How about: "Design content that allows presentation according to the user's needs and preferences, and the capabilities of the user's environment."  </s>
<s> 2) Checkpoint 1.5: "Separate content and structure from presentation".  </s>
<s> I've mentioned this previously: UAAG 1.0 uses the term "content" to mean "everything in the document object".  </s>
<s> I understand that WCAG 2.0 may use the term content with another meaning.  </s>
<s> Still, I would encourage harmonization in the use of terms.  </s>
<s> How about something like: "Organize your ideas first, then design their presentation (on screen, on paper, as audio, as speech, etc.)."  </s>
<s> 3) Checkpoint 1.7: "Ensure that content transforms gracefully."  </s>
<s> I think this checkpoint is so broad as to be very problematic.  </s>
<s> For instance, must I ensure  </s>
<s> that my HTML content transforms into plain text gracefully if the user's user agent strips out all markup?  </s>
<s> How does the author decide what is allowed to break down (markup language, style sheets, scripts, HTTP, character encoding, etc.)?  </s>
<s> Also, the term "gracefully" is lovely, but maybe something more concrete could be used.  </s>
<s> How does this checkpoint interact with checkpoint 4.2 (use markup, etc. according to specification).  </s>
<s> If I write perfect HTML and CSS, I'm not in the clear because checkpoint 1.7 says that I also have to ensure that this content transforms gracefully.  </s>
<s> What do you do in the case of presenting an XML document without style sheets?  </s>
<s> How does that transform gracefully without style sheets?  </s>
<s> I don't have a counter-proposal for this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I agree with the goal, but I think that it's important to be more specific in stating what's required of the author.  </s>
<s> Guideline 2: "Design content that can be interacted with according to the preferences and needs of the user."  </s>
<s> I think that Guideline 2 and Guideline 1 statements should be harmonized.  </s>
<s> Based on my G1 proposal: "Design content that allows interaction according to the user's needs and preferences.  </s>
<s> 4) Checkpoint 2.2: "Minimize content that will interfere with the user's ability to focus."  </s>
<s> Since in UAAG 1.0 we use the term "focus" to refer to the thing that designates the current focus, this might lead to confusion.  </s>
<s> Also, I think that "minimize" and "avoid" share the same problems that the WG has discussed.  </s>
<s> Going way out on a limb here:  </s>
<s> "If your content might disorient the user (e.g., due to blinking or animations), ensure that the user can control the disorienting content, or provide an alternative that will allow the user to concentrate on the important content."  </s>
<s> 5) Checkpoint 2.3: "Give users control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes in content."  </s>
<s> Are the differences between 2.2 and 2.3 clear enough to merit their separation?  </s>
<s> Or are both about "Don't do what may disorient the user."? I'll bet the WG chose to separate these on purpose, and I do see some differences between them, but I'm not clear why they need to be distinct.  </s>
<s> 6) Checkpoint 4.3: "Design assistive-technology compatible interfaces."  </s>
<s> "Designing interfaces" sounds like this is for user agent developers.  </s>
<s> Should this be "use interfaces" like checkpoint 4.2 says "use languages, APIs, and protocols"?  </s>

<s> I would really like to enlist Al Gilman in crafting the "control" language.  </s>
<s> My goal is to transcend the "user as PWD" aspect and concentrate on the "rights" of every user to be, in principle and fact, the ultimate arbiter of things controllable.  </s>
<s> Users and their agents/environments are whom we ally with - it will make them better authors!  </s>
<s> A (the?) fundamental function/goal/duty of any "performer" is to serve the audience.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>

<s> Thank you for your comments.  </s>
<s> sounds fine to me.  </s>
<s> I propose to leave this as is and see what happens at the unified glossary meeting.  </s>
<s> yes, the working group has resolved to find better wording for several reasons but did not have any wording that we felt was sufficient for this draft.  </s>
<s> We resolved to leave it as is but request feedback in the public working draft.  </s>
<s> Right - you have to be aware that following the spec does not always produce content that "works" because browers have not implemented the specs consistently.  </s>
<s> also, authors should take into account that newer specs have deprecated features of older specs or introduced newer features that did not exist in older browers.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint does not say that XML must be available without style sheets.  </s>
<s> That is one very obvious bug in WCAG 1.0 that we are not replicating in 2.0.  </s>
<s> In the case of XML, the transform requires style sheets.  </s>
<s> However, if the user's browser does not support XML then we might have a problem.  </s>
<s> Yes, so do we but we haven't fleshed it out yet.  </s>
<s> That's why this is a working draft without consensus of the working group rather than a recommendation or last call.  </s>
<s> sounds good.  </s>
<s> yes, that's way out on a limb (i.e., really long) grin/ I see your intent here and will discuss with the working group.  </s>
<s> There may be some overlap perhaps we can combine.  </s>
<s> We'll discuss.  </s>
<s> This may not change for this first release though.  </s>
<s> Refer to Cynthia's comments on this one.  </s>
<s> Thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa  </s>
<s> I agree with Cynthia.  </s>
<s> As I recall, this checkpoint is aimed very squarely at content that is creating an interface - for example a form, but also more complex applications.  </s>
<s> (If it isn't, we need one there that is.) In terms of techniques, the whole of the User Agent Guidelines is useful as a reference (some parts more so than others perhaps)... cheers Charles McCN IJ: 6) Checkpoint 4.3: "Design assistive-technology compatible interfaces."  </s>

<s> All content "creates an interface".  </s>
<s> When you create a web page, you are creating a user interface, even if that is simply "one left mostly undefined except for the browser's defaults."  </s>
<s> This is a principle I so very much wish I could impress upon web designers, who don't view web design as UI design.  </s>
<s> Any time you create a web document or application, you are building -some- kind of interface for users, be that an interface to information or to program functionality.  </s>
