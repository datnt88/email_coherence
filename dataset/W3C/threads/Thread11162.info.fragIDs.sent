<s> Considering documents this way might clarify discussion (and then again, maybe not), and it would certainly clarify explanation: "An XML document can be a complex structure, including a style sheet or even choice of style sheets, and some metainformation about who and how it was produced, just like a Word document carries its formatting and some meta along with its text, although you don't see everything when you look at it in Word."  </s>

<s> In one view, the meta-document is just a regular XML document that "starts" an client-application specific processing model.  </s>

<s> davep@acm.org  </s>
<s> On the one hand, Yes.  </s>
<s> That is, rendering (creating an appearance for a medium, e.g. 256 colour raster display) is behaviour.  </s>
<s> It can be specified by appeal to less (LaTeX) or more (DSSSL) or most (Java) procedural means, but processing is always involved or implied.  </s>
<s> On the other hand No. That is, it is attractive to suppose that rendering behaviour will treat link descriptions in the same way as the rest of the markup in a document, encouraging us to use the same mechanism, namely style specifications, to determine rendering behaviour for link descriptions as we do for the rest of the document.  </s>
<s> The SGML Way is to use DSSSL for this when you can.  </s>
<s> It remains to be seen whether this group thinks that XSL (= an XML-targeted DSSSL subset) will do the job, or whether augmentations will be necessary.  </s>
<s> I for one would NOT be happy if such augmentations took us outside the domain of rendering into e.g. user interactions.  </s>
<s> In other words, all rendering is processing, but not all processing is rendering, and specifying ALL processing needs a general-purpose programming language.  </s>
<s> SMF, TNMJ.  </s>
<s> ht  </s>
<s> If the running of this code is controlled by user interaction at the client its appearance: if it is action that is forced on the application by information from the server it is behaviour!  </s>
<s> (Author defined formatting is currently being referred to as behaviour: user defined formatting is currently being referred to as appearance.  </s>
<s> Both types are required - its the point of control that defines whether it is a behaviour or not.)  </s>
<s> The DSSSL style sheet as sent by the author is a behaviour.  </s>
<s> The version as modified by the user, or the overrides issued by the user, is what constitutes a change of appearance.  </s>
<s> The terms appearance and behaviour are misleading, like addresses/locators/explainers....  </s>
<s> They say what the result is, not what you need to get there.  </s>

<s> It's just a matter of interpretation.  </s>
<s> Code is data is code.  </s>
<s> Java bytecodes are nothing more than a processing specification until they are interpreted, and there are a number of ways *that* can be done as well...  </s>
<s> As soon as you start defining objects that have some behavioural semantics associated with them, you also open up the possibility of people interpreting the semantics.  </s>
<s> Please don't use the term "meta-document".  </s>
<s> It invites confusion with the term "metadata" (currently much bandied around).  </s>
<s> Some documents contain information.  </s>
<s> Others contain information about information (metadata).  </s>
<s> I would expect every XML piece of content worth its salt to have an associated metadata document (or metadocument) describing what it is and where it came from, in the same way as a catalogue card describes a book, or a tei header describes a tei document.  </s>

<s> For the kinds of purposes that SGML (and XML) propose to support -- i.e. re-use they _are_ the same.  </s>
<s> That is why some of us are so vociferous about separating processing from data content (and insistent as Len says, that we have only a bag of (structured) values, behavior and rendering free).  </s>
<s> Anytime we break that distinction, we make some form a reuse more difficult or impossible (depending on how central to the document markup the formatting decisions become).  </s>
<s> Now, if these reuse issues are not appropriate in a WWW context, then we should not be doing XML at all, but working on adding more kinds of behavior tag to HTML so that it can finish its metamorhphosis into "Postscript for the Web".  </s>
<s> This is all baby SGML, folks.  </s>
<s> It's the _point of the whole thing_.  </s>
<s> So let's finish it, but stop dragging over the same issues.  </s>
<s> I don't mind Postscript for the web, but if that's our goal then we don't need generic tagging to get there.  </s>
<s> Who cares.  </s>
<s> If we want the rendering/processing independent part of the document to retain those properties it must be separated from the rendering/processing instructions.  </s>

<s> 2. Something describing the union/intersection model described above for metadocuments.  </s>

<s> Complex problems never cease to be complex problems and simple solutions rarely solve them.  </s>
<s> Here is, again, my opinion: 1.  </s>
<s> The "Minimal-constructs-to-declare-success" is some kind of SO-catalog model.  </s>
<s> It has its drawbacks which was well pointed out.  </s>
<s> 2. The uniform and scalable infrastructure is a metadocument architecture or whatever you want to call it--a bootstrapping document that starts the whole process off.  </s>
<s> This is more complex and, to some extent, will require rejecting the premise that XML must be kept as simple to implement quickly.  </s>

<s> Thus, they don't scale well for the non-simple user.  </s>
<s> Can we accept this?  </s>
<s> I am certain that SO-catalogs can be worked elegantly into a metadocument architecture such that we could be compatible with them if we choose to implement a metadocument architecture in the future.  </s>

<s> In addition, it would seem that the metadocument archictecture has somewhat been approached by Sun in Java.  </s>
<s> JAR files are "archive" files that allow delivery of class files, data (documents, images, etc.) all within one stream from the server.  </s>
<s> I haven't experimented with this very much but it would seem that they had a similar issue: my program is made up of distinct components that I must locate and load from the server.  </s>
<s> They decided that having one archive to retrieve would improve efficiency.  </s>
<s> In light of this, is a metadocument archive something that will be the new paradigm for delivery of content/applications arcoss the web?  </s>
