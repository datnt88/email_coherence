At today's meeting I took an action item to draft an alternative definition of "Web site" derived from observations I made during the meeting. 
I don't necessarily support this proposal; it is merely presented as an alternative to what was suggested at the face to face meeting. 
Web site: A linked collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. 
Examples of administrative entities include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and individuals. 
Web sites may include interactive user interfaces, multimedia and other forms of content. 
Doubtless this proposal can be improved. 
Using Dict.org: 
From WordNet (r) 1.7 : web site n : a computer connected to the internet that maintains a series of web pages on the World Wide Web; "the Israeli web site was damaged by hostile hackers" [syn: internet site, site] From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02) : web site (Not "website") Any computer on the Internet running a World-Wide Web server process. 
A particular web site is identified by the hostname part of a URL. 
Multiple hostnames may actually map to the same computer in which case they are known as "{virtual servers". 
(1997-02-05) The Jason's proposed definition: "Web site: A linked collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. 
Examples of administrative entities include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and individuals. 
Web sites may include interactive user interfaces, multimedia and other forms of content." could be adapted, with receipt of official dictionary words (and respecting the "plain language"), with this sentence: "Web site: Any computer connected to the internet that maintains a series of web pages on the World Wide Web, controlled and managed by a single administrative entity, like governmental departments, public/private corporations or individuals, which can be accessed via a URI (link to "URI" definition) and include web contents (link to "Web Content" definition) that request interaction with user agents (link to "User Agent" definition)." 
I think we need to apply a similar definition to explain to the WCAG readers that the web site is made with "web content" (that request WCAG) that are usable with user agents (that request UAAG). 
This is MHO :) Roberto Scano [1] http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict

To The Group - Jason, I do like the basic approach you took and have some things I'd like to add. 
First, I will say what the basic additions might be and then add them to what you previously wrote. 
1. Web sites may well have linked and un-linked resources such that individuals are directed to a URI that may not be publically available. 
I may choose to tell a client to go to a certain page by directing them there via e-mail or a phone call. 
The information they receive is under the same domain name but not at all available to "just" anyone. 
This information is part of the web site as I see it. 
I only added, "or un-linked" below. 
Web site: A linked (or un-linked) collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. 
Examples of administrative entities include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and individuals. 
Web sites may include interactive user interfaces, multimedia and other forms of content.

Someone pointed out to me in private e-mail that a Web site can be controlled by several different entities. 
For example an internet service provider may host users' content on its Web site; that content itself is created and controlled by each individual. 
In that case the conformance claim would have to say, for example: This Web site, excluding personal pages created by users of the service, meets WCAG 2.0 at the minimum level. 
Or if users are bound by an accessibility policy that the hosting provider has set, there need be no such exclusion. 
I don't think we need to be too precise about what we mean by "Web site", because we aren't using the term to draw any normative distinctions in the guidelines, and thus whether a certain collection of resources counts as one Web site or two doesn't matter so long as the conformance claim is clear as to what is and isn't covered. 
Hum... this will exclude all the web sites CMS-generated from the WCAG check... 
Also, remembering the claim of WCAG 1.0 [1], in "Scope of the claim" there is the following text: "By default, a conformance icon refers to a single page. 
If the claim is meant to apply to include more than one page, the conformance icon must be accompanied by explicit scope information explaining which pages are covered by the claim." 
So, IMHO, is not possible to said "This Web Site .... .meets 
WCAG 2.0 at the minimum level" but the claim must be done per single page. 
If *and only if* all the page conform would be possible to said "This web site meets WCAG 2.0 Also, would be best to have a conformance claim page by page and/or a unique web site definition for level areas reached like in the P3P Policy [2]: here follow an idea about how different policy/conformance claims could be assigned to different folder. 
These my two cents :) Roberto Scano [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance.html.en
