Regards, Judy Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) International Program Office World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE3-355, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA Latest version, incorporating many of the suggestions sent to me. 
Key changes: - No more references to things that are "complex" or "important." - New wording for TABLES. 
The key point seems to be that under HTML 4.0, tables can be made accessible. 
I describe what is needed. 
Unfortunately, no browser supports this now... - I changed "web-devices" to "web technologies." 
(A suggestion from Dena Shumila. 
Screen readers and Braille displays are not, strictly speaking, devices. 
They are software + hardware.) Alan Text version follows. 
Full size Mockup in Word 97 attached. 
W3c LogoWAI logo Tips for making your site accessible to people with disabilities and users of portable or slow web-devices 1. Photographs, images &amp; animations Concisely describe the purpose or content of all visuals. 
Use the Alt="text" attribute. 
2. Page organization A consistent page layout helps people with visual and learning disabilities. 
Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages easy to scan. 
3. Imagemaps Many people cannot use a mouse. 
List imagemap hot spots as a menu of text anchors using MAP. 
Ensure that every link can be activated using keyboard commands. 
4. Tables Some web-technologies require the headers, scope and abbr attributes to render tables. 
Always use these attributes. 5. Graphs &amp; charts Summarize content, or provide a long description. 
6. Frames Some web-technologies cannot render frames. 
Label each frame with Title or Name, and include a linear version of its content within the Noframes element. 
7. Hypertext links Descriptive links improve access for those who cannot see. 
Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone. 
8. Audio For people who cannot hear, prepare audio descriptions or link to a page containing transcripts or descriptions. 
9. Evaluate accessibility View your site with different browsers; switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools. 
See www.w3.org/WAI for the complete WAI Page Author Guidelines Text-only version follows. 
The mockup is attached. 
The points have been reordered, in accordance with peoples' wishes, but mostly to make everything fit. 
Everything just barely fits now. 
See the new TABLES point. 
Our collective version was too long to fit, so I put on my alchemist's cap and started distilling and sublimating. 
How close have I come to discovering the philosopher's stone and the universal panacea? 
To those who happen to use laser or inkjet printer technology: I ask that you print out the card. 
Is everything legible at this scale? 
It is small. 
I kept the same typeface size, but I had to shrink the spacing between paragraphs, and in some cases, between lines and letters. 
If there are legibility concerns, let me know. 
There are a couple of words that can be trimmed -- even if we prefer that they not be. 
Please get your comments to me as soon as possible. 
The next version should be it.

6 Frames Some web-technologies cannot render frames. 
Label each frame with title or name, and include a linear version of its content within the NOFRAMES element. 
7 Tables Some web-technologies have trouble reading tables. 
Avoid using tables to format text columns. 
Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes to mark-up complex tabular information. 
8 Audio For people who cannot hear audio content, provide captions or transcripts. 
9 Video Provide text or audio descriptions of video content. 
10 Evaluate accessibility View your site with different browsers; switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools. 
See www.w3.org/WAI for the official Page Author Guidelines &amp; techniques I printed it and circulated it in the local staff here at W3C Sophia, ranging from HTML guru to HTML savvy people. 
What do we mean by summaries? 
It would be better to convey the idea of structure, maybe using table of content ? 
I thought we decided to remove "Ensure that every link can be activated using keyboard commands", which is really a browser issue. 
Also it would give some air between the logos and the intro sentence, which is too tight right now. 
The sentence "List imagemap hot spots as a menu of text anchors using the MAP element" didn't parse for most people, we need a different wording, like: Use the MAP element to provide imagemap hotspot text anchors. 
One person was confused by "names", since he knew name is an HTML attribute akin to URL, so he thought we were saying use URL with meaningfull names (ala http://www.foo.com/SalesReport98.htm, 
instead of http://www.foo.com/bar.htm) 
Someone said we should mention CSS there, not just say "don't do that". 
Another said these new attributes should be marked as such. 
Related: when printed thru Word, I'm missing a bunch of letters in the card headings: "Ga p s" instead of "Graphs" for instance. 
Any idea ? is my best attempt to make an html page resembles the card layout. 
Thanks to help from Bert Bos, this version doesn't use a TABLE for layout :-) (and is the closest you can get to HTML4 strict) This is version5 as per Alan, not updated with any changes I suggested in my previous email. 
To get a better idea of the card layout on paper, one needs to resize its graphical browser to have the HR at the bottom of the page centered in the card (it's size is fixed in em unit)
