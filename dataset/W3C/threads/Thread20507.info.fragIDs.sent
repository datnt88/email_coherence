Hi all I'm new at this mailing list, and so it is likely that this has already been mentioned before. 
If I use Amaya (version 4.3.2 
under Win95) to open the file: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" 
I get a linebreak between "An" and "example". 
Was this supposed to happen? 
Best regards Jos?

When i cut and pasted this test document to my system [ windows 98 / Amaya 4.3.2 
binary ] i didnt get a linebreak --- but i also didnt get a space between an and example --- anexemple was my view. 
I have noticed that in mathml stuff the space after a closing angle bracket is often eaten up as well. 
If required for test purposes, check the demo sample at

Oops! You're right. 
But you do get a linebreak if you withdraw the tags p and /p . 
Of course, this is not good HTML. 
But the HTML code after the end of this message is good HTML good and in that case you also get a linebreak that wasn't supposed to be there.

This is a rule (see http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#whitespace) 
You should write instead of 
No. Comment declaration is a markup, but it's neither a start tag nor an end tag. 
If you check the ESIS output of nsgmls, you'll see that both examples are treated as: (P -An example )P A white space between "An" and "example" MUST be preserved.
