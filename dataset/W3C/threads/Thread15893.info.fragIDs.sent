I'm a newbie to audio renderings of math. 
But I've got to say, in support of Chris Maden's proposal for a semantic math markup, philosophically speaking, it indeed splits content from presentation. 
Plus I find it more readable than the others. 
(Although this may not be completely fair; I'm looking at the screen, not listening to it; and I've already worked with Maxwell's equations) Furthermore, by using a suitable stylesheet, this semantic markup could be translated into either MathML markup for people who prefer those representations. 
I'm not speaking of CSS stylesheets of course: you'd need something with the power of DSSSL (http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/~dmg/dsssl/tutorial/tutorial.html); maybe XSL.

MathML has everything you need to do good audio renderings. 
I've been part of the MathML working group since its inception and was an active participant in the initial design phase--and have been a passive observer since to make sure that the representation was adequate for producing multiple presentations. 
While I appreciate the effort that's gone into MathML, I think a static math document type is a mistake. 
Moreover, MathML is schizophrenic about whether it wants to be presentational or semantic. 
MathML's presentational markup can be accessible by voice or touch, but with a certain amount of ambiguity. 
You know that something is superscripted, or that numbers are positioned one over the other, but you don't know if the superscript is an exponent or an isotope, or if the \over is a division or a combinatorial. 
(Justify mphantom from an accessibility point of view.) On the other hand, any static semantic DTD will be ignored by the scientific and mathematical communities, because new notation is often introduced to express new ideas. 
Moreover, MathML's semantic elements are infix operators - Knuth thought the \over infix was a bad idea twenty years ago, and only justified it by technological limitations that no longer hold. 
A better idea, IMO, is to promulgate a markup *methodology* instead of a DTD, whereby expressions and elements are homologous, and presentation is in the stylesheet where it belongs. 
My markup method is similar to MathML's semantic apply and relation elements, but attempting to enumerate all applications and relations is doomed. 
Instead, authors can choose appropriate element type names; even without a stylesheet, the markup is readable, and the author can provide a stylesheet that allows for whatever new markup he wishes to introduce. 
As an example, here are Maxwell's equations, in presentational MathML, semantic MathML, and my own proposal ( URL:http://www.oreilly.com/people/staff/crism/math/ 
): !-- presentational MathML -- mrow mrow mi fontslant="plain" &amp;nabla; /mi mo &amp;middot; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" E /mi /mrow mo = /mo mfrac mi &amp;rho; /mi msub mi &amp;epsilon; /mi mn 0 /mn /msub /mfrac /mrow mrow mrow mi fontslant="plain" &amp;nabla; /mi mo &amp;times; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" E /mi /mrow mo = /mo mrow mo - /mo mfrac mrow mi &amp;part; /mi mo &amp;ApplyFunction; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" B /mi /mrow mrow mi &amp;part; /mi mo &amp;ApplyFunction; /mo mi t /mi /mrow /mfrac /mrow /mrow mrow mrow msup mi c /mi mn 2 /mn /msup mo &amp;InvisibleTimes; /mo mrow mi fontslant="plain" &amp;nabla; /mi mo &amp;times; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" B /mi /mrow /mrow mo = /mo mrow mfrac mrow mi &amp;part; /mi mo &amp;ApplyFunction; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" E /mi /mrow mrow mi &amp;part; /mi mo &amp;ApplyFunction; /mo mi t /mi /mrow /mfrac mo + /mo mfrac mi j /mi msub mi &amp;epsilon; /mi mn 0 /mn /msub /mfrac /mrow /mrow mrow mrow mi fontslant="plain" &amp;nabla; /mi mo &amp;middot; /mo mi fontweight="bold" fontslant="plain" B /mi /mrow mo = /mo mn 0 /mn /mrow !-- semantic MathML -- !-- 
This is impure, as semantic MathML is lacking vector functions for the inner or dot product, cross product, divergence, and curl. 
It also appears to lack a simple negation, in the negative-number (as apposed to functional inverse) sense.

Len (and others) Please dont dismiss the MathML work too lightly. 
We agonized over the trade-offs between semantic and presentational markup and I persoanlly believe that the MathML specification does an outstanding job of addressing both camps. 
There are quirks like phantom present in there as Chris pointed out, but these were also left in because they were felt to be essential for certain presentations. 
Also, to address Chris's point about static DTDs being restrictive and inadequate for math I fully agree and have been saying this ever since I built AsTeR to handle LaTeX documents --this is one of LaTeX's significant advantages over SGML in my opinion. 
Again, we did our best in the MathML work to make sure that the language was extensible in the sense LaTeX is, but at the same time remains something that can be validated --something that is hard to say of a Turing complete language like TeX.

Raman, You're right that I didn't give any thought to the need to control presentation. 
So I did skip over that a bit too lightly. 
But still, what do you think of the proposal of writing a DSSSL style sheet that translates Maden's proposal for semantic math markup to MathML? 
The semantic math markup could specified via XML and thus extended at any time; and simultaneously the DSSSL stylesheet could be extended to optimally produce the optimal MathML markup. 
Might this give the best of both approaches? 
Or perhaps you had considered that and rejected it out of some consideration I'm not thinking of?

Len-- I have not had time to carefully study the "semantic notation' that was posted here -- and I also think it would be hard to judge its merits or demerits by just looking at one particular equation (Maxwell's equation) in this case. 
This is not to cast any doubt on the design of that proposed markup-- all I am saying is that I have not had time to study it carefully nor do I expect to have the time do so. 
However the folks on the MathML committee have thought over these issues long and hard and the work is mature --it has been in development for over two years. 
The tone of your message indicates that you in turn have perhaps not studied MathML carefully-- I say this because you appear to give the impression that MathML is purely presentational which is far from the truth. 
Anyway, all I can say at this point is: A) MathML is carefully thought out and well designed to address both the needs of semantic markup while still preserving the ability to do good presentation b) From experience I can confidently say that attempting to design it will take another two years and yield a result not too different from what we have At this point the need is for software that will render MathML in alternate formats and provide some badly needed user tools as opposed to re-embark on some new Not-invented-here exercise.
