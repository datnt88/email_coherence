<s> Karl, Thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> In this message I have tried to answer your questions.  </s>
<s> They are both good ones, addressing difficult parts of OWL.  </s>
<s> The rdf:about attribute provides a name or reference for the ontology.  </s>
<s> Where the value of the attribute is "", the standard case, the name of the ontology is the base URI of the owl:Ontology element.  </s>
<s> Typically, this is the URI of the document containing the ontology.  </s>
<s> An exception to this is a context that makes use of xml:base which may set the base URI for an element to something other than the URI of the current document.  </s>
<s> Getting all of the mirrors aligned with entities, namespaces, xml:base and references has been tricky.  </s>
<s> But in this case there is no conflict.  </s>
<s> If rdf:about is explicitly given a value, that is what it is.  </s>
<s> If the attribute value is "", then it is interpreted to be the base URI of the owl:Ontology element.  </s>
<s> Which can be set by xml:base.  </s>
<s> Your comment did generate at change to the Abstract Syntax &amp; Semantics documents so that it and the Guide were more clearly aligned.  </s>
<s> Tools will respond to this situation in an implementation defined manner.  </s>
<s> Agreed that this is undesirable.  </s>
<s> That said, there are reasons we left this unspecified.  </s>
<s> The formal syntax and semantics describe what well formed OWL documents look like and how they are interpreted.  </s>
<s> It is much harder to specify what happens operationally if there is a failure of the supporting infrastructure.  </s>
<s> Our general view was that there should at a minimum be some way to detect failures, but we did not see clearly how to add such a mechanism to OWL.  </s>
<s> Some of our test cases address these issues.  </s>
<s> See for example # 4.2.2.  </s>
<s> Consistency Checker # An OWL consistency checker SHOULD report network errors occurring # during the computation of the imports closure.  </s>
<s> Consider cases of extensive, distributed ontologies, where the inability to import a few ancillary facts would ideally not bring all reasoning to a halt.  </s>
<s> Additionally, one of the target consumers of OWL ontologies are autonomous processes.  </s>
<s> How they proceed in the face of failure to download an ontology component is an open topic.  </s>
<s> Please reply to the mailing list as to whether the above response adequately addresses your comments.  </s>
