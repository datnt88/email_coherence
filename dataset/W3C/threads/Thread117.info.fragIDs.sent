<s> I think I've discovered a dangling pointer bug in istack.c.  </s>
<s> When PopInLine() in istack.c  </s>
<s> pops the stack, it fails to check if lexer- insert is pointing past the new end of stack.  </s>
<s> This can cause a subsequent call to InsertedToken() to dereference the bogus lexer- insert.  </s>
<s> The fix is in the last if statement of PopInLine(), where the stack is popped: if lexer- insert points past the end of the stack, set it to null.  </s>
<s> (It's possible a similar check needs to be performed just above, too.)  </s>
<s> The following document should cause this condition to occur.  </s>
<s> I could not see any outward symptoms on Windows NT but it should be simple to see in a  </s>
<s> debugger.  </s>
<s> I don't have a C compiler/debugger, so I can't verify this firsthand or provide the C code for the fix.  </s>
<s> However, I've seen this occur in JTidy using a Java debugger.  </s>
<s> The JTidy equivalent to the fix described above seems to work.  </s>
<s> Also, I think this is the cause of a previously reported ArrayOutOfBounds exception in JTidy: ------------------------ Example HTML document --------------------------- Thanks, Randy  </s>
<s> Yes, it looks like you are right.  </s>
<s> Andy Quick supplied a "fix" over a year ago, that I applied to my code, but had never seen the effect of this "fix" until your example.  </s>
<s> Specifically, Andy added the following lines at line 204 (04 Aug 00 version) of istack.c in function InsertedToken() : if (lexer- istacksize == 0)/* Andy Quick 13 Jun 99 */ tidy_out(lexer- errout, "0-size istack!\n");  </s>
<s> I have yet to verify your suggested fix.  </s>

<s> This one has been bugging me for a while.  </s>
<s> I will post a new Java tidy, with this fix, soon.  </s>
