I've heard that you are not in compliance with Section 508 unless you have an email address to specifically address accessibility issues. 
I do not remember reading this as part of the standards. 
Is this a true statement? 
Thanks in advance Scott 
Sorry about the signature problem. 
I am used to signing and encrypting emails and I periodically forget to disable it. 
Below is the original message. 
You are correct that it is not required by the standards to have an e-mail address (on your website) to specifically address accessibility issues. 
The Department of Justice, in their Section 508 Self-Evaluation asked the following question: 9. Has your agency designated and advertised an e-mail address to allow people with disabilities to inform you of accessibility problems encountered on your web site? 
See http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/agency_questionnaire.htm (requires an underscore between "agency" and "questionnaire"). 
Although agencies are not required to designate and advertise an e-mail address to allow people with disabilities to inform the agency of accessibility problems encountered on a web site - it is a good idea to do so.
