<s> Two (hopefully) simple questions:  </s>
<s> 1. In a HEAD response, what should Content-Length be set to?  </s>
<s> The length of the (non-existent) object body, or 0?  </s>
<s> 2. Is there a view on how locally-time-stamped data should have their Last-Modified GMT computed?  </s>
<s> It's impractical to recreate the true original GMT time-stamp (as the timezone and daylight savings regime of the place of last modification is usually unknown).  </s>
<s> Using the current GMT offset will result in the timestamp of some data jumping forwards or backwards an hour, twice a year, which could affect caching.  </s>
<s> Mike Cowlishaw IBM UK Laboratories  </s>
<s> The length of the object-body that would have been returned had the request been a GET.  </s>
<s> There are many views as to how this should be done, but none of them are within the realm of the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> All that matters is that the date used within the protocol is GMT (UT).  </s>
<s> How the date is obtained (and, in fact, what it means to be "modified") is entirely up to the application sending the object.  </s>

<s> This is not very clear in the description of the Content-Length field that it describes the length of the object referenced by the URI, which may or may not be present in the message.  </s>
<s> Maybe HEAD should return the description of the object as the object body of the message so such ambiguities and overloading dont occur.  </s>
<s> Doesnt the lack of a clear meaning of modification make this almost ' useless, except maybe for a matched pair of client and server that have a common meaning.  </s>
<s> It needs to reflect that either the content as returned is different then previous to the date.  </s>
<s> I could also reflect metainformation change, such as expiration updated.  </s>
<s> But, I think that is a little too nebulous.  </s>
<s> Either way, some agreed meaning needs to be assigned to modified.  </s>

<s> From "Roy T. Fielding" fielding@avron.ICS.UCI.EDU  </s>
<s> Not to be a party pooper, but what about URIs that point to things like CGIs which generate content on the fly?  </s>
<s> Would it be appropriate in this situation to not return a content-length header?  </s>
<s> Zero would be as wrong as any other number in this case.  </s>
<s> In truth, it's possible that it doesn't even matter if the conversion to UTC is done or not, as long as the server is consistent.  </s>
<s> Simply appending a GMT to the local time can work, since the clients are asking for changes from a previously returned time.  </s>
<s> As long as the time is consistent (and different), IMS will work.  </s>
<s> This breaks things like clients that automatically expire, but is this a valid use of IMS anyway?  </s>

<s> From "Roy T. Fielding" fielding@avron.ICS.UCI.EDU  </s>
<s> As dynamic objects don't have a default Content-Length the right thing to do would be not to send the header field at all.  </s>
<s> This is one of the the reasons why the field can not be mandatory.  </s>
<s> Ohh - this would screw up a lot of cache managers which use the LM (which is the previously returned value) if the expired header is not present.  </s>
<s> They don't like to get a future last modified date!  </s>
<s> I would not recommend this at all!  </s>
<s> -- cheers -- Henrik  </s>
<s> Neither of the words `modified', `different', and `change' do define what is actually meant by this field.  </s>
<s> And this is how it should be!  </s>
<s> It does _not_ make it useless but merely take away the binding to the date and time typically given by the file system.  </s>
<s> As somebody (sorry, but I don't remember who) pointed out, a document can be generated automatically on every request, however, this doesn't necessarily indicate that the LM field should change value.  </s>

<s> I will clarify the description of HEAD.  </s>
<s> The latter suggestion, though appealing from a design point of view, is outside the scope of HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> Well, there is an implied meaning as given by the name (i.e. when the object was last modified).  </s>
<s> What is not defined is how much (or how little) modification needs to occur, and why.  </s>
<s> All that matters is that the origin server thinks that the object was last modified at the given time -- the client is trusting that the server knows what it is talking about.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we could define it in terms of how it is used, i.e. "If you have a copy of this object which is older than the given LM date, that copy should now be considered stale."  </s>
<s> Maybe.  </s>
