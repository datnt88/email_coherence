<s> Several people have proposed defining the RE/RS problem out of existence by defining the RE and RS function charcters as codes that won't occur in entities, via the SGML application for XML.  </s>
<s> James Clark takes the stand that the definitions of RE and RS are what  </s>
<s> codes the parser should communicate to the application when they are encountered, so redefining them won't change whether or not they occur.  </s>
<s> He also posits that lines in an input file from DOS or UNIX should be interpreted as records.  </s>
<s> That certainly seems a reasonable interpretation, but I can't find anything to that effect in 8879.  </s>
<s> Clause 7.6.1, "Record Boundaries", defines the rules for RE ignorance or preservation, but doesn't say anything about when the parser generates an RS or RE signal.  </s>
<s> Charles Goldfarb's commentary thereto (pp.  </s>
<s> 321+322 of the SGML Handbook) discuss translating lines into records, but that's not normative.  </s>
<s> The best normative thing I can find is 4.140, "function character identification parameter: A parameter of an SGML declaration that identifies the characters assigned to the RE, RS, and SPACE functions, and allows additional functions to be defined."  </s>
<s> This suggests that, since characters are assigned to functions, that the characters in the document should assume the roles of these functions; ergo, if non-ocurring characters are the ones assigned to those roles, the function characters never occur.  </s>
<s> Is that not the intended meaning?  </s>
<s> If not, what is?  </s>
<s> I think that, if the RE/RS problem can be redefined out of existence, that it can be very easily handled at the application level.  </s>
<s> Some have suggested this already; I outlined a proposal in conversation with Gavin Nicol, and he seemed to think it worthwhile.  </s>
<s> I'll send that in another message if others agree that it is possible for an application of ISO 8879:1986 (not :2001) to define every entity to have a single record.  </s>

<s> The standard (and the Handbook) recognize the possibility that records might not exist in some storage formats.  </s>
<s> In those cases, you can assign RE/RS out of existence.  </s>
<s> But when records actually exist, you *cannot* evade handling them by not assigning RE/RS and sweeping them under the rug (where "rug" = application or entity manager).  </s>
<s> But when *do* "records actually exist"?  </s>
<s> There is a perception evident here, and one that I had always taken for granted, that the data between carriage returns (a "line") was to be interpreted as a record.  </s>
<s> But I can't find anything in 8879 to that effect!  </s>
<s> IBM mainframes have records; they are definitely records, and nothing else.  </s>
<s> But in an ASCII text file, from UNIX, DOS, or Macintosh, what constitutes a record, normatively?  </s>
<s> I think 8879 does not prescribe a particular behavior in this regard.  </s>
<s> In any case, the fiat of the ERB (per Eliot) seems to have rendered this discussion moot for the purposes of the Working Group.  </s>
<s> I'm still interested in the subject, but we probably shouldn't clutter the list.  </s>

<s> If a document is created in an editor that lets you enter tags as text, you must deal with REs.  </s>
<s> That is because you could be using white space to "format" the source text, and some of that whitespace will be indistinguishable from true information.  </s>
<s> (See my earlier postings on this point.)  </s>
<s> If the editor only lets you enter elements through menu selection, it can avoid having any "formatting" REs in its source document.  </s>
<s> It is for such editors that the standard makes provision for assigning the RE/RS characters out of existence.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: You can assign the RE/RS characters out of existence, but not the RE/RS problem.  </s>
<s> It is inherent in all direct entry of markup and undelimited data, not just SGML.  </s>

<s> Nothing in the standard _requires_ recognizing the RE/RS functions at all.  </s>
<s> Defining RS/RE out of the code space is just to avoid wasting code points (which are valuable in 8-bit code-spaces) on something that will never occur.  </s>

<s> Journal Special Issue papers, I think) to avoid record-based files altogether.  </s>
<s> I think a lot of the RS/RE trouble comes from confusion between the representation and that which is represented.  </s>
<s> Some people (many people) want to be able to say this is a monospaced example and the columns line up.  </s>
<s> and have spaces, tabs and newlines be significant in the markup in order to represent that in a ``WYSIWYG'' way.  </s>
<s> Then people with no background in design can try and lay out their source code or DTDs and align unrelated things at the expense of clarity :-), and neither the receiving application nor the screen or paper layout designer can correct the errors without extensive hand work, it's awful.  </s>
<s> Rants aside :-), this is an insidious form of minimisation.  </s>
<s> Insidious because it does not in fact have a fully normalised form!  </s>
<s> It is one thing to use SHORTREF or DATATAG to map newline to BR or &amp;linebreak; or something.  </s>
<s> It is quite another to use spaces tabs and newlines to draw ASCII art.  </s>
<s> If people want to do this, they should use a NOTATION.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need a kind of Unix vgrind that takes an SGML instance or DTD fragment and pretty-prints it into an XML representation.  </s>
<s> that lets you view C in Panorama, for example) and plain text, how important would this issue still be?  </s>
<s> You can't include C or C++ in SGML without pre-processing anyway, because of int *ip = &amp;i; being not only legal but common, unless you change ERO to be @ or something else saner than &amp;.  </s>
<s> Same with perl.  </s>
<s> Unix shell scripts are OK with &amp; because it's not usually followed by a name, although 1 &amp;2; occurs fairly often in both shell and awk.  </s>
<s> But you do get prog input output, which isn't OK in #PCDATA, and even prog /tmp/xxx which can't go in CDATA.  </s>
<s> You can edit the files to put spaces in or quote the  and &amp;  signs, but that's pre-processing.  </s>
<s> So I suggest that in the Twenty Page XML Book there by a note about how to include program listings, and exactly which characters need to be escaped, and how to escape them, and have done with it.  </s>
<s> And if multiple spaces and newlines need to be escaped, as I expect, say how. Lee  </s>
