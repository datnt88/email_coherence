As a web developer, for me the argument is not wether not to images or text, but the accessability of the location to a text-browser as well as a graphical one. 
Dropping graphics to the eager-to-see graphics surfer does not acheive accessability, in fact it discourages visitation. 
We ought not to forget that images carry messages especially to the visual-dependant! 
To clarify my position, I think that text links are more usable than images are links, which in turn are more usable than image maps. 
This applies to users of graphical browsers. 
There are many reasons for that, including the ability to ditinguish between visited and unvisited links and using active and hover feedbacks. 
In a text browser, all three options are equivalent (if there is correct alt text) as images and image maps are upgarded to text by the browser. 
When in 'Text' mode, visited, unvisited, active and (IE)hover works perfectly well, with the assistance of CSS. 
So where is the argument.

My point on tables was that some authors write image maps that arrange the links to look like a table (usually with one column; see the notorious CNN interactive site) I said that using an HTML table with text links, gets the same look as an image map (see CNN interactive text-only bad-tables version) without loosing the advantages of text links. 
Clearly from the point of view of accessibility putting the links in a a list is better than in a table.

Image maps - just say no. 
To make long stroy short, the problems with image maps are mostly usability problems in graphical media. 
Shurel: When in 'Text' mode, visited, unvisited, active and (IE)hover works perfectly well, with the assistance of CSS.

Nir: 1. W3C hover, not IE hover. 
Also Lynx marks the hovered link with a different color (although it has a completely different pointing device). 
2. You don't need CSS for hover, both Lynx and IE4 apply user's default hover colors/styles without any stylesheet of the author. 
3. The argument is that most (or all?) versions of Netscape and Explorer cannot be configured to 'Text' mode. 
They present "alt" text is a small size font, even if it is H1. 
The only graphical browser that I know that can be configured to something close to text mode is Opera. 
Users of Netscape and Explorer in graphical mode with images either on or off suffer a lot from websites written under the assumption that their readers are stupid people who can't read, or "visual-dependant[sic.]" as someone put it. 
Also in graphical media with no mouse (e.g. tv ) image maps constitute a very serious usability problem.

I agree on all points except one, i.e., (3). 
If we stick to the topic of image maps. 
In an image map, we don't need headers H1 , or do we? Image maps are nothing but navigation means via points. 
Well if the link of the image map cannot be reach, I suppose that the normal links cannot be reached either.
