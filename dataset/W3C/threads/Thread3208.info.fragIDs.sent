<s> (David P. Kemp) Perhaps you should check with RSADSI to see if they still regard RC4 as an "unpublished work", despite the fact that it leaked out some time ago.  </s>
<s> I believe the answer is "yes", so anyone (at least in the US) who wants to ship an "RC4-compatible" cipher should have lawyers ready.  </s>

<s> They probably won't win, but they will certainly make it cheaper for a company to license than fight."  </s>
<s> RC4 appears to be a strong cipher.  </s>
<s> The TLS protocol should clearly not mandate the use of proprietary ciphers, but neither should it prohibit their use.  </s>
<s> I agree with this evaluation.  </s>
<s> It should be included.  </s>

<s> I noticed that the draft still contains references to ciphersuites including the unpublished algorithms RC2 and RC4.  </s>
<s> Of course an  </s>
<s> Internet-Draft is just that, a draft, and can contain anything.  </s>
<s> But if we are to have a document that will allow us to move forward towards a Proposed Standard RFC, this will have to be fixed in another iteration of the draft, before we can go to Last Call.  </s>
<s> I believe RC2 is still a trade secret, but RC4 was leaked to the Cypherpunks list in September, '94.  </s>
<s> The algorithm is described in Chapter 17 of Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography", 2ed.  </s>
<s> 2 Mount Royal Avenue http://www.gradient.com  </s>

<s> Yes, of course it is.  </s>
<s> And "alleged RC4" is also posted on Ron Rivest's the statement "There is no good reference to these [RC2, RC4] as they are unpublished works" in the SSL specification.  </s>
<s> This statement is still included in the current TLS draft -01.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you should check with RSADSI to see if they still regard RC4 as an "unpublished work", despite the fact that it leaked out some time ago.  </s>
<s> Why don't we add some Blowfish CipherSuites?  </s>
<s> It's a published (and public domain!) algorithim.  </s>

<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> And Blowfish was mentioned the last time this came up, several months ago.  </s>
<s> The point of removing RC2 and RC4 from the TLS base document is *not* to prevent their use with TLS, it is to restructure the IETF TLS standard as a core document plus additional ciphersuite-specific documents.  </s>
<s> This follows the IPSEC example of generic AH/ESP documents supplemented by additional transform-specific documents.  </s>
<s> I thought the working group had reached consensus on a modular document structure, and am a bit disappointed that the present draft does not reflect that consensus.  </s>
<s> The TLS base document should specify mandatory-to-implement algorithms to promote interoperability.  </s>
<s> Currently the DES/3DES ciphersuites fill that role, but Blowfish or another published and freely-available algorithm might conceivably be suitable as the interoperable baseline.  </s>
<s> TLS "transform" documents could be written to specify the use of many other ciphersuites, published or proprietary, including RC2, RC4, Blowfish, SAFER, Fortezza(R), etc.  </s>
<s> This makes it easier to add future ciphersuites to TLS without having to re-do the base document every time.  </s>
<s> Glad to see the draft available!!  </s>
<s> I believe the answer is "yes", so anyone (at least in the US) who wants to ship an "RC4-compatible" cipher should have lawyers ready.  </s>
<s> (The name "RC4" is probably trademarked, regardless of the secrecy of that algorithm.)  </s>
<s> Now, is this foolishness?  </s>
<s> Trying to claim Trade Secret protection for something that's clearly not a secret?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> But it's lawyers and judges which have to agree on that, not mere mortals.  </s>
<s> I don't know that the IETF wants to fund those lawyers.  </s>
<s> If it does, that'd be very good news.  </s>

<s> Just because it is published in a book (or on a mailing list) does not mean it is acceptable to use in a standards track RFC.  </s>
<s> I think the question is,  </s>
<s> "which algorithms can we have in this draft and still move it towards standards track?  </s>
<s> Also, Please note Chris' statement that the TLS mailing list is moving from "ietf-tls@w3.org" to "ietf-tls@consensus.com".  </s>
<s> --Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium  </s>
<s> I spoke to Jeff Schiller (area director for security), and we think that the reference to Schneier is sufficient for the TLS spec.  </s>
<s> Having the RC4 ciphersuite is important, I think, because of its widespread use in SSL today.  </s>
<s> Without a similar description of RC2, it isn't appropriate to include the ciphersuite.  </s>
<s> - Win Treese  </s>
<s> FYI ...  </s>
<s> RFC2026, especially section 7.1 and section 10 provides guidelines for how to incorporate external specifications into standards track documents.  </s>
<s> Section 7.1.2 says if the owners of RC2 and RC4 aren't willing to make these "widely and readibly available, the IESG may request that it be published as an Informational RFC".  </s>
<s> Section 10 has language that says that patented technology can be incorporated, provided the owners will provide a license under general and nondiscriminatory terms.  </s>
<s> I'll leave to the IESG to determine if both RC2 and RC4 meet these tests.  </s>

<s> The language in RFC2026 stems from an ANSI requirement for "standards providers" (of which IETF is one) so that the incorporation of intellectual property into a standard doesn't impose an unreasonable barrier to the standard's implemention.  </s>
