<s> While it may be inelegant to simply double the number of ports for security, it probably won't actually cause any serious insurmountable problems in the future.  </s>
<s> An application-level protocol or scheme for negotiation up to SSL/TLS will forever cause compatibility and interoperability problems.  </s>
<s> Saying "it's easy" to come up with a universal scheme to allow this kind of negotiation is naive.  </s>
<s> In reality, it's probably impossible.  </s>
<s> As applications warrant it, we should either decide to assign a separate port for secure communications, or come up with a single-port scheme if the original protocol makes it possible.  </s>
<s> I'd like to suggest that telnet be an application that should have a separate port.  </s>

<s> TLS is little more than an encrypted tunnel.  </s>
<s> It does not address other protocols such as UDP; authentication of the client is optional; authorization is not addressed; and the primary purpose for which SSL was developed -- secure web page access -- is subject to spoofing attacks [1] (consequently, so are the other services such as telnet).  </s>
<s> Though vendors are pontificating its virtues and proliferation (to their profit), TLS only addresses a small class of the security problems.  </s>
<s> TLS requires a CA, unless one of the proposed shared key mechanisms are adopted.  </s>
<s> There is not a global CA infrastructure, more or less a US infrastructure.  </s>
<s> Worse, in the US there is the real possibility of escrow.  </s>
<s> Associated with  </s>
<s> most CAs is a financial transaction.  </s>
<s> Though traditional use of security (in particular, cryptography) has often been labeled as "not for free", requiring investment in a CA or purchase of a CERT gives the term new meaning.  </s>
<s> Though I see great value in TLS and consider it a good protocol, there are issues and I urge caution.  </s>
<s> There are mechanisms to perform the secure negotiation of capabilities even in the face of escrow: the originator signs his capability list along with other information (such as a replay token).  </s>
<s> Though I do not know the laws of all the world's jurisdictions, to my knowledge the use of strong crypto for authentication is universally permitted.  </s>

<s> Such as? - broken clients that predate the negotiation protocol that manage to accidentally trip the negotiation sequence, but obviously can't complete it.  </s>

<s> Hiya Most protocols have a clearly defined server response to unknown client requests (much like the HTML "if you don't know it ignore it" rule).  </s>
<s> IOW, if a news server gets a strange command from a client, the protocol says it must return with something like "500 Que?". "nntps" just means "establish a secure news connection.  </s>
<s> fail if you cannot".  </s>
<s> Whether that secure connection goes to the same or a different port is immaterial.  </s>
<s> Saying that the same port is more subject to DOS attacks is silly: you wouldn;t expect Navigator to connect to port 80 if port 443 failed, would you?  </s>
<s> I think all: - command oriented - interactive protocols (NNTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4 etc) can be upgraded to support TLS negotiation just by the addition of a single client command.  </s>
<s> Making the server be able to initiate secure session negotiation is harder because most of these protocols are client-driven.  </s>
<s> But I'll comment further on Monday.  </s>

<s> Begging your pardon, but Thawte's strategy is entirely global.  </s>
<s> Also, because we are based outside the US, the only way we would consider escrow is if the US government explicitly banned the use of non-escrow keys within the US - an unlikely proposition.  </s>
<s> As soon as it's possible to conduct quality checks free, there will be quality free certs.  </s>
<s> Certification should not be an expensive thing at all.  </s>
<s> We don't think so.  </s>
<s> Also, I think we'll see "micro-certification" become important.  </s>
<s> By this I mean the certification of small, easy to prove but also valuable relationships, like "this key is managed by the person at the end of this email address".  </s>
<s> Xcert, Thawte, Verisign, etc. all have projects that explicitly or implicitly suggest this trend.  </s>
<s> Mark Shuttleworth Thawte Consulting  </s>
<s> If Thawte can establish a global presence, comply with international and domestic law, assure the authenticity of every source (implying possible legal liabilities), assure the redundancy, reachability, and integrity of each of their CAs (implying liabilities again), and interoperate with existing CAs (such as AT&amp;T), then they will offer a great service.  </s>
<s> However, if they cannot then the service is of marginal value and no different than the patchwork of CAs operating today.  </s>
<s> I haven't read anything on the subject in a while but in the US there was a proposal to have the US Postal Service offer CA services and issue CERTs based on the presentation of US accepted identification.  </s>
<s> I do not recall if the proposal included a fee for CERT issuance.  </s>
<s> I also am suspect on the "US accepted identification" part.  </s>
<s> If I remember correctly the identification was a valid US driver license.  </s>
<s> Ha! The issuance of a CERT must be based on strong verification of who it is issued against.  </s>
<s> Without strong verification the authenticity of any CERT is suspect.  </s>
<s> Verification offers interesting challenges not only in the US but around the globe.  </s>
