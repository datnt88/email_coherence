<s> In the range specification section it says: * In the case that the second integer is smaller than the first one, an empty range is returned.  </s>
<s> Since the specification says just above that point that: * The first integer must always be less than or equal to the second one.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that in cases where the second integer is smaller than the first, an error message indicating a malformed header should be returned (rather than an empty range).  </s>
<s> An empty range doesn't tell the requester what went wrong; an error message might.  </s>
<s> In the section on the return of multiple ranges as multipart MIME messages, the draft says "A server may send also a single byte range as a multipart message."  </s>
<s> Why should a server send a single byte range in a multipart message, and would that break any clients expecting, not unreasonably, multiple parts to a multi-part message?  </s>
<s> I also note that the draft gives the response Range header as Range: bytes x-y/z .  </s>
<s> Is z in use to handle situations where a new version has occurred between the clients request of one byte range and another, and, if so, isn't that already handled by the other headers (you note that the if-modified-since works with this)?  </s>
<s> I also assume that the Last-modified header and if-modified since header will generally be applied to the document as a whole, not to the individual byte-ranges, but I'm afraid I didn't find the draft to be too clear on this point.  </s>
<s> Regards, Ted Hardie NAIC  </s>
<s> Only in the case of binary files does the byte stream transmitted by the server stand a chance of being identical to what what it has stored locally on disk.  </s>
<s> In the case of multi-fork or multi-part files, this won't be the case.  </s>
<s> In the case of HTML files, for example, end of line termination ruins the whole byte range theory.  </s>
<s> Many servers politely convert their machine specific EOL sequence into a normalized version (LF or CR/LF) for the transmission of text-only files.  </s>
<s> This is a severely broken behavior by a server.  </s>
<s> And IRRELEVANT.  </s>
<s> Since byte range requests are not recognized by todays servers - you obviously cannot break one by insisting the damn server keep its hands off the content if it support byte range requests.  </s>
<s> IOW: Find another red herring to drag.  </s>
<s> Oh, servers that do ISO translations, Shift-JIS translations, or line end translations that conform to the MIME standard are "severely broken?"  </s>
<s> Methinks not.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you should study the available range of servers out there before dismissing this particular issue as a "red herring."  </s>
<s> Server side document translation is a HUGE issue, and many servers support it.  </s>
<s> The point that the local storage representation of a document is not the same as the content transmitted to a client is a very real and valid one.  </s>
<s> Overlooking this issue or dismissing it shows a very narrow understanding of server implementation issues and the state of server development as it exists today.  </s>
<s> Please take a little more time to understand what is going on here before you unilaterally decide that your position is correct.  </s>
<s> This means that there is a potential creep of at least 1 byte per EOL in the file.  </s>
<s> A client asking to resume a transfer at byte 900,000 only has the data stream it was receiving to go by.  </s>
<s> This means that the server has to completely re-read the file, translating line ends and looking for the "virtual" 900,000th byte as rendered by the server.  </s>
<s> It's not simply a matter of jumping forward in the file 900,000 bytes and resuming reading.  </s>
<s> That is the server's author's problem problem.  </s>
<s> Really.  </s>
<s> If the server author is stupid enough to try and *PARSE* a document when not explicitly requested to so - they deserve all the headaches they bring on themselves.  </s>
<s> They are clearly violating the intent of '8 bit clean' by saying '8 bit clean, except if we think you messed up your end of lines we are going to re-write them, so you can't reliably use \x0a and \x0d because we might change their number or order without warning you.  </s>
<s> Sorry about that.'  </s>
<s> There is NOTHING in any standard or convention that says a server cannot convert content prior to sending it to a client.  </s>
<s> Especially when that client is served out of something other than the cannonical Unix file system.  </s>
<s> One day everyone will realize that life on the Internet is NOT a Unix server, NOT a Unix file system, and certainly NOT a Unix client.  </s>
<s> Your assumption that the server just blindly tosses data with no interpretation to the client is naive at best and points out exactly why I am raising this as an issue.  </s>
<s> Too many people assume wrongly that the data served by a HTTP server is stored on the server's local storage medium in exactly the same byte-for-byte format as it is transmitted to the client.  </s>
<s> This is an incredibly wrong assumption and it will become moreso as the complexity of server-side objects increase and the amount of translated or generated content increases.  </s>
<s> The entire byte range concept is rooted (mired) in the concept that WWW servers sit on top of (Unix) file systems.  </s>
<s> The simple fact is that they don't.  </s>
<s> And more and more the trend is away from file system document trees because of the semantically poor representation structure they provide.  </s>
<s> Servers residing on databases will likely be the norm within a year or so, and then what does a byte range URL get you?  </s>
<s> [deleted special purpose solution for PDF documents] Pull the blinders back off.  </s>
<s> IGNORE PDF.  </s>
<s> There is a general problem with restarting partially transmitted documents that that is just a special case of.  </s>
<s> We need a method of saying *for any document what-so-ever*: "Send me bytes 10000 through 20000".  </s>
<s> Perhaps you should take YOUR blinders off and realize that HTTP transmitted content is not a simply byte stream as far as the server is concerned.  </s>
<s> The data objects are more complex than a simply binary file on disk, the operations and translations performed on them are more involved than blindly reading content off the disk and squirting it onto the net, and that server implementors have a lot more to be concerned with than implementing an inefficient, partial solution to the problem you describe.  </s>
<s> I would turn the problem around by asking you why clients only have partial documents to contend with?  </s>
<s> You seem to want to implement Zmodem file transfers on top of HTTP, with the ability to resume an interrupted transfer.  </s>
<s> The net is not a modem connection.  </s>
<s> TCP/IP is ostensibly a reliable delivery mechanism.  </s>
<s> You either get all the data or you don't.  </s>
<s> So, why are you getting partial files?  </s>
<s> Is your client broken?  </s>
<s> If so, that doesn't seem to warrant a change to the URL standard to fix it.  </s>
<s> Is the server broken?  </s>
<s> Ditto.  </s>
<s> Is your net connection flakey?  </s>
<s> Again, not a HTTP or URL problem.  </s>
<s> If the issue is to deliver portions of an entire document because that portion is a recognizably distinct object that the browser can deal with, I say let the server specify how those parts are to be requested and delivered.  </s>
<s> This is a much more rational, useful reason for byte range extensions to exist.  </s>
<s> Trying to justify them with some specious argument about resumed file transfers is perhaps the biggest red herring of all.  </s>
<s> And trying to anticipate every server-side representation scheme by generalizing everything to a byte stream takes us back to 1975 when Xmodem  </s>
<s> showed up on the scene.  </s>
<s> LIFE IS NOT A BYTE STREAM.  </s>
<s> The Web already deals  </s>
<s> with more complex objects than this.  </s>
<s> The semantics of these objects are arguably outside the scope of the HTTP and URL standards and should be negotiated between the applications that produce and consume these objects, not the underlying transport protocol or the static addressing scheme for these objects.  </s>
<s> Let's talk about matched sets of viewers/CGIs instead of warping every standard under the sun and getting into endless academic standards discussions.  </s>
<s> The existing standards are already more than sufficient to support any type of client/server application you can think up.  </s>
<s> But, you must be willing to accept a paradigm shift away from trying to legislate/mandate everything within the context of a narrow standard towards a model where the application-level protocols that ride on top of these standards cooperate to provide a more complicated exchange of info than the underlying protocols can hope to represent.  </s>
<s> It's fun to wave your hands and tell everyone what to do because some overengineered standard says so.  </s>
<s> It's a lot more fun to cooperate with others on the net to build something bigger than a few paper documents by making APPLICATIONS cooperate.  </s>
<s> And it's a heck of a lot faster and easier to do, too.  </s>
<s> You, I, and everyone else on this list are not wise enough or experienced enough to anticipate the possible future directions that information technologies will take even in the next year.  </s>
<s> Rather than overengineer a nice, simple standard like the HTTP or URL standard, why not accomplish the same thing within the context of the existing standard, simply by build applications that cooperate within that context?  </s>
<s> What is your argument against a CGI/viewer solution?  </s>
<s> What is the argument FOR a generalized URL based solution?  </s>
<s> These are the questions that need to be answered.  </s>
<s> I've presented a valid set of problems with the current byte range proposal.  </s>
<s> While you may have dismissed them, it doesn't diminish their magnitude, nor do you provide a viable solution for those problems.  </s>
<s> Please provide some constructive solutions instead of simply throwing rocks at a workable alternative.  </s>

<s> According to Chuck Shotton:  </s>
<s> This is true.  </s>
<s> But that is a very different statement than saying "Nothing is a byte stream," which seems to be what you are arguing.  </s>
<s> Servers can offer byte ranges on those files that they choose.  </s>
<s> It is perfectly fine for this to be the empty set.  </s>
<s> Presumably no server will offer byte ranges on CGI output.  </s>
<s> Saying that byte ranges won't work well on parsed documents is probably true.  </s>
<s> But that is not an argument that byte ranges should never be allowed.  </s>
<s> I suspect that image and sound files are never parsed, for example.  </s>
<s> Parsed files really are a red herring in this discussion.  </s>
