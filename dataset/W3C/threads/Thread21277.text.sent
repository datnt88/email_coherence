Help! The Amaya Documentation says something like "We'll explain later how users can create their own types." 
I can't find this explanation, or work out what to do. 
Tim Hello Tim, You're right. 
We haven't yet updated this part of the doc, but the work to do is quite easy. 
First some info... 
The annotation and annotation types RDF schemata are currently stored in the Amaya/config directory under the names annotschema.rdf and annottypes.rdf. 
As we can't yet dynamically download schemas from the web, we have another file called annot.schemas that tells Amaya the filenames where we stored the annotation schemas. 
This file is also under Amaya/config/ Now, if you want to add new annotation types, you'll need to define their namespace and write their schema. 
This is quite easy. 
Let's do a new namespace called MyTypes. 
I add the following line to the end of annot.schemas: 
Then I'll add a new annotation type called "kudos" in mytypes.rdf: 
rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" 
And that's all. 
Next time I launch Amaya, I'll see the new Kudos annotation type. 
Look at the annottypes.rdf 
file to see other examples. 
As you can see, Amaya is not yet able to download schemata dynamically from the Web. 
For Amaya to understand the semantics of Kudos (the label in this case), the schema has to be stored in the Amaya/config directory. 
If this were not the case, then Amaya would have shown the URL of the property when browsing annotations of this type. 
It wouldn't have been possible to create such a type with Amaya either. 
These are things we need to further develop. 
Tell us if you have any problems or other questions. 
-jose Some further clarification: Amaya does not yet dynamically load RDF schemas from the Web. 
It loads only the schemas listed in Amaya/config/annot.schemas (SMOC - small matter of coding). 
But Amaya will load schemas from the Web if annot.schemas tells it to do so. 
For the two namespaces copy of the schemas. 
These are the first two files Jose is referring to. 
It is legitimate to cache a copy of an RDF Schema as http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327 says that once you publish a namespace name you should not change the contents of the namespace. 
note that, per the comments in annot.schemas, if you just put (without a second field) into that file then Amaya will attempt to read the schema from the Web. 
-Ralph Dear Colleagues, Thank you for your advice. 
I followed it, I thought correctly, but when I relaunched Amaya, the annotation type list was unchanged. 
This is how my copy of annot.schemas 
(in Amaya/config) now reads: # annot.schemas 
# specifies the RDF schemas to be pre-loaded for Annotations # each line beginning with '#' is a comment # all other non-empty lines must be in one of two formats: # 1. namespacename # 2. namespacename filename # In case 1, an RDF schema is expected to be found at the namespace URI # In case 2, the filename is expected to be a (local) copy of an RDF # schema for the namespace. 
The strings $THOTDIR and # $APP_HOME may be used at the beginning of the filename # and will be expanded to the Amaya installation directory # and the user's amaya home directory respectively. 
# Historical schema presented at WWW9. 
Obsolete. 
#http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/annotation-ns# #first release schema; do not change unless you also change the service #some Annotation subclasses that we think will be useful #a new namespace called "MyTypes" This is how mytypes.rdf now reads (in the same directory): rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" rdfs:seeAlso resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/Collaboration/Annotation/papers"/ rdfs:comment A class of Annotations representing glosses on vocabulary and usage /rdfs:comment rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/ Note: I initially wrote the antepenultimate line (and the fourth line before that) as in your example, namely: and respectively. 
When this didn't work, I tried the modifications indicated, not knowing exactly what I was doing! 
I expect that I have missed something obvious, and would be grateful for your advice.

Subject: Re: changing annotation types under Amaya Dear Colleagues, I have tried following these instructions, without success. 
This is my file in Amaya/config entitled mytypes.rdf: 
rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" rdfs:comment A namespace for describing types of annotations /rdfs:comment rdfs:comment $Revision: 1.2 $ $Date: 2000/11/03 21:40:17 $ /rdfs:comment rdfs:seeAlso resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/Collaboration/Annotation/papers"/ rdfs:comment A class of Annotations representing positive congratulations /rdfs:comment rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/ 
This is my revised annot.schemas 
file: # annot.schemas 
# specifies the RDF schemas to be pre-loaded for Annotations # each line beginning with '#' is a comment # all other non-empty lines must be in one of two formats: # 1. namespacename # 2. namespacename filename # In case 1, an RDF schema is expected to be found at the namespace URI # In case 2, the filename is expected to be a (local) copy of an RDF # schema for the namespace.

#http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/annotation-ns# #first release schema; do not change unless you also change the service $THOTDIR/config/annotschema.rdf #some Annotation subclasses that we think will be useful #to add new types (Tim Moore) I'd be grateful for advice. 
Best wishes, Tim Moore Dear Colleagues, I followed Jose's advice, but it didn't work. 
I've probably missed something obvious. 
My annot.schemas 
file in Amaya/config now reads: # annot.schemas 
# specifies the RDF schemas to be pre-loaded for Annotations # each line beginning with '#' is a comment # all other non-empty lines must be in one of two formats: # 1. namespacename # 2. namespacename filename # In case 1, an RDF schema is expected to be found at the namespace URI # In case 2, the filename is expected to be a (local) copy of an RDF # schema for the namespace.

# Historical schema presented at WWW9. 
Obsolete. 
#http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/annotation-ns# #first release schema; do not change unless you also change the service #some Annotation subclasses that we think will be useful #to add new types (Tim Moore) I added a new file entitled mytypes.rdf, which reads rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" rdfs:seeAlso resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/Collaboration/Annotation/papers"/ rdfs:comment A class of Annotations representing positive congratulations /rdfs:comment rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/ (This involved departing from Jose's message by adding an initial " ".) When this did not work upon reinvoking Amaya, I tried changing the MyTypes prefix in mytypes.rdf 
to match the one in annot.schemas, but this did not work either. 
I have tried this on two separate machines. 
I'd be grateful for advice. 
Best wishes, Tim Moore
