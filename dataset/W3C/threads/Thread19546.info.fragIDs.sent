<s> Hi, do you have any idea how to set Section numbering as default (on WinNT  </s>

<s> Today Section numbering is controlled document by document by an internal attribute but that attribute is set and unset by the command SectionNumbering.  </s>
<s> I guess there are 2 requests in your message: 1) you want to have a global control of this feature instead of a control document by document.  </s>
<s> 2) you want to keep the set/unset value from a session to another.  </s>
<s> The solution is to replace the command SectionNumbering by an entry in the configuration menu.  </s>
<s> In that case the default setting can be controlled by the user and can be kept along different Amaya sessions.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>

<s> Hi, nice to hear, that the list is not dead.  </s>
<s> [MCepl] Well, I suppose for serious work with section numbering, we would need both, but it should be enough to have latter (it is not so bad to set this for each new document, while it is only  </s>
<s> once).  </s>
<s> Another idea, would not it be possible to support some particular part of CSS2 (counter-* stuff ???), which would allow to set this for whole class of documents.  </s>
<s> However, if it is easier, new item in  </s>
<s> Configuration (not even in the menu, config file would be enough) would fit wonderfully.  </s>
<s> OK, now another stuff, when I took you on-line :-).  </s>
<s> I feel it hard to edit files when I am missing some lovely Windows characteristics (Yeah, even such things exists!  </s>
<s> :-).  </s>
<s> The most important for me seems to be ability to select arbitrary text by Shift+[any movement of cursor].  </s>
<s> I do not know, if it is too difficult to  </s>
<s> make it working, but for me it is one of the most important features missing (section numbering for each printing is piece of cake).  </s>
<s> Other shortcuts missing are Ctrl-O (open new file), Ctrl-N (either new document or new window for current one -- but former is better, I suppose), Shift-Ins (eq.  </s>
<s> Ctrl-V - Paste), Ctrl-Ins (eq.  </s>
<s> Ctrl-C - Copy), Shift-Del (eq.  </s>
<s> Ctrl-X - Cut).  </s>
<s> Other thing is that I am not able to print on my printer.  </s>
<s> I have to print to PS file and such file print via GhostScript.  </s>
<s> Only then, sometimes, it is possible to print to the printer directly.  </s>
<s> It is not so bad, as I am not printing too much, but it is disturbing.  </s>
<s> Last issue - how to destroy q by menus only?  </s>
<s> Have nice day Matthew Other things are much less pressing:  </s>

<s> During the last month we were involved in many external events.  </s>
<s> So we had some difficulty to follow the mailing list.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> We're considering that, but not for the June release.  </s>
<s> All that is normally available in the 2.0a release.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it needs some improvement.  </s>
<s> In current version 2.0a Shift+[any movement of cursor] works if you have removed or commented these lines in your file amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> Key Up: TtcPreviousLine() Key Down: TtcNextLine() Key Right: TtcNextChar() Key Left: TtcPreviousChar() You can also have your personal file $HOME/.amaya/amaya.keyboard and add your personal shortcuts.  </s>
<s> Sorry, on Unix platforms we only support PostScript printers.  </s>
<s> Oops, there is a bug here.  </s>
<s> I will fix it.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
