The example below is for Guideline 3.1, Level 3 SC 3 Example 6: Links to a video clip of a press conference. 
A Web page includes links to two versions of a video clip from the governor's press conference. 
The link text reads, "Video of Governor's press conference (for high-speed connections)" and "Video of Governor's press conference (for dial-up connections)."

Roberto Scano: Hi, With SMIL, is possible to set this... video dur="0:00:45.67" 
region="videoregion" src="high_spacetime.avi (high rate)" alt="Video: Big Bang" system-bitrate="40000" video dur="0:00:45.67"

alt="Video: Big Bang (medium rate)" system-bitrate="24000" video dur="0:00:45.67" 
region="videoregion" src="low_spacetime.avi" 
alt="Video: Big Bang (low rate)" system-bitrate="10000" 
Very cool! 
That's two things you've taught me in the same day grin ! 
However, I think the example is appropriate to current practice-- there are many sites that provide separate links to high- and low-bandwidth versions of multimedia objects, and the link text often fails to identify the target clearly. 
For example, at http://utopia.utexas.edu, 
JAWS reports the following: Graphic Nerve Cell Image Using lasers to guide nerve cell growth keeps The Raizen Group on the cutting edge of science. 
Table with 3 columns and 2 rows Graphic Quick Time Link graphic play low bandwidth version of this video Link graphic play high bandwidth version of this video Graphic Real Media Link graphic play low bandwidth version of this video Link graphic play high bandwidth version of this video Table end This is on the home page of a major University Web site, specifically intended to make University resources available to all citizens of the state of Texas.

I don't know any professional Web designer who would use anything that verbose, nor is that the sort of thing we find on actual sites. 
A more likely and preferable markup is: Governor's press conference (Windows Media) (or just Hi and Lo) And then of course that invites fundamentalists to bitch that somebody committed the cardinal sin of reusing link text on a page. 
And aren't we suddenly concerned about link length?

Right, Joe, I don't know many professional Web designers who'd use such verbose link text either; but I'm not sure that's a good thing. 
I *do* know professional Web developers who use the same link text for multiple video clips on the same page-- asin the example I cited, where the page includes two different videos and where the link text for each reads simply "high" and "Low." 
If one uses a links list-- in JAWS, Home Page Reader, John Gunderson's Accessibility extensions, or some other agent-- one won't be able to tell where these links point, let alone that they point to different places. 
"Windows Media" is a meaningful phrase for tech-savvy users; it may not be meaningful, though, to many people who might want to see or hear what the governor had to say. 
(High bandwitdth might not be so great in that connection, either.) John "Good design is accessible design."
