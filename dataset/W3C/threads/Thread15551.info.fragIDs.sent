<s> Right, Joe, I don't know many professional Web designers who'd use such verbose link text either; but I'm not sure that's a good thing.  </s>
<s> I *do* know professional Web developers who use the same link text for multiple video clips on the same page-- asin the example I cited, where the page includes two different videos and where the link text for each reads simply "high" and "Low."  </s>
<s> If one uses a links list-- in JAWS, Home Page Reader, John Gunderson's Accessibility extensions, or some other agent-- one won't be able to tell where these links point, let alone that they point to different places.  </s>
<s> "Windows Media" is a meaningful phrase for tech-savvy users; it may not be meaningful, though, to many people who might want to see or hear what the governor had to say.  </s>
