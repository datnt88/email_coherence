<s> I am writing an XSL stylesheet, which already produces decent PDF output.  </s>
<s> However, it's far from finished (no toc, def, eg, code, var, etc.).  </s>
<s> I should have a more complete version by next week, but if you can't wait, let me know, and I'll send you the current one.  </s>
<s> I've fiddled with xmlspec.xsl to output one file per section.  </s>
<s> It needs xt and it generates pretty much the same output as what you can see on most specs, except the next and previous links on each slice because of the xt 'deep space' bug.  </s>
<s> I've also made some minor changes to xmlspec.xsl, but I'd also like to finalize that before submitting it to your approval (tomorrow or friday).  </s>
