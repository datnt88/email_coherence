aloha, y'all! 
in considering the question "what dependencies exist between ER and the Authoring Tool Guidelines (AUGL)?" 
i have concluded that there is at least one clear cut dependency, namely the possibility of rolling an existing evaluation and repair tool into an authoring tool, so as to allow the user to retrofit existing pages/sites, as well as providing accessibility checks and validation for newly created pages/sites... the evaluation and repair tool (ERT) need not -- and probably should not -- be bundled into the authoring tool, but, rather, should be accessed online, thereby ensuring that the authoring tool is making the latest version of an ERT available to the user, rather than saddling the author with an antedated pre-packaged version... there is precedent for such an integration -- Allaire's HomeSite, for example, allows one to use some online utilities/engines to check things such as broken links, so why shouldn't an authoring tool also make an online ERT available to its users? 
providing a mechanism whereby your pages and/or sites can be checked via an online ERT is an easy out for smaller developers who can't afford to develop and maintain their own ERT, but who want to satisfy as much of the AUGL as possible with the programming time available to them... as for where this fits into AUGL, i'd say Guideline 4: "Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content" gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.

Charles asked: well, when i originally wrote up my potential dependency statement, i ended with the phrase: "hmm... am i getting soft in my old age, or just realpolitiky?" but to answer your question, i think that resolution can be achieved by proposing the use of online services as a technique -- i'm not so confident about including external tools or plugins, however, unless the external tool or plugin has a built-in "Check for Update" option (or, at the very least, if such an update option for the ERT is available via the AU tool) to me, the essential point is getting _some_ sort of ER capacity built-into AU tools, and whilst i personally don't know if this is the optimal solution, it _is_ a potential solution (or, if you prefer, kludge) yes, it ties the evaluation of a work-in-progress to an online entity, which requires that the author be connected to the internet when running the evaluation, but it also keeps the ERT from becoming stale and out-moded, which is -- at least in my opinion -- a greater threat to accessibility than having to be online when one wants to evaluate the accessibility of one's work... gregory.
