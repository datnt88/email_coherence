I thought it was for 12 noon today (boston time), and my watch says it is 10 minutes to. 
On the other hand I am without telephone again, so that saves me finding one. 
Charles McCathieNevile The UA telecon for today has been canceled, due to lack of participants. 
I was a little late getting on the line, and when I arrived there were no participants.
