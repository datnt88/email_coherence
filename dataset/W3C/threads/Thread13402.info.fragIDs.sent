<s> In general that's what would be needed.  </s>
<s> However, if we do, the user should have the option of turning it off when analyzing documents known to be all in English.  </s>
<s> We want to avoid too many false alarms.  </s>

<s> For criteria like this one which are 100% dependent on natural language comprehension, what about the following collection of techniques: Embed coaching about marking up the language of text in the documentation and tutorial for the tool.  </s>
<s> Don't warn on each page open.  </s>
<s> Do check [by default] on save and close.  </s>
<s> Perhaps prompt for "save in template?"  </s>
