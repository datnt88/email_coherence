<s> Hi, I requested for some files but they have an extension of .001.  </s>
<s> How do I open them?  </s>
<s> e,g, bible10_zip.001  </s>
<s> Regards Dilip  </s>
<s> Dear, First you have make sure that you have all the parts of the files.  </s>
<s> (001, 002, ...) Next you save them.  </s>
<s> Then you copy all of them into one big file For UNIX, you use cat bible10_zip.*   </s>
<s> bible10.zip  </s>
<s> For MSDOS &amp; Windows, use copy/b bible10_zip.001+bible10_zip.002+(list a ll other parts here) bible10.zip  </s>
<s> Now you can use your favourite unzipping utility (pkunzip, unzip or winzip) to open the one big bible10.zip  </s>
<s> Happy reading.  </s>
<s> I have aproblem.  </s>

<s> My old email address is mailto:james_b33069@yahoo.com and my new email address is, james_bishopsr@yahoo.com.  </s>
