<s> These are some personal comments that arise out of a review I was asked to do for the RDFcore working group.  </s>
<s> I must emphasize that they are offered as personal comments, as they do not cover any official RDFcore WG concerns.  </s>
<s> I looked briefly at the abstract syntax section [1] (it actually looks like a quite concrete serialization to me), which does appear to be very well presented, then at section 4.1 [2] of the OWL abstract syntax and semantics document, with a particular view to seeing if I could understand how to do the mapping.  </s>
<s> I've spent about half a day looking at the "abstract syntax" (it actually looks like a quite concrete serialization to me), and have started to sketch a Haskell [3] implementation of the mapping [see attachment].  </s>
<s> I come to the following conclusions: 1.  </s>
<s> I do believe that I could implement a mapping to RDF based on this description, but with some guesswork.  </s>
<s> 2. I think the presentation of the mapping leaves something to be desired.  </s>
<s> I could not have started to grasp what was going on without  </s>
<s> actually trying to think about the details of an implementation.  </s>
<s> There was some discussion about the purpose of these transformation rules.  </s>
<s> From the description given, I think it is to translate OWL AS to an  </s>
<s> RDF graph, but others have also suggested that they might be used for defining inverse transformation.  </s>
<s> I don't think the mapping table is well-suited to that purpose.  </s>
<s> More detailed comments are below.  </s>

<s> Concerning section 4: This section defines a many-to-many relationship between abstract syntax ontologies and RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> This is done using a set of nondeterministic mapping rules.  </s>
<s> "Non-deterministic"?  </s>
<s> Scary, if the goal is well-defined semantics.  </s>
<s> The mapping is designed so that any of the RDF/XML graphs that correspond to a particular abstarct ontology have the same  </s>
<s> meaning, as do any of the abstract ontologies that correspond to a particular RDF/XML graph.  </s>
<s> Good.  </s>
<s> How confident can we be that this is so?  </s>
<s> Why complicate the transformation with options that are not needed?  </s>
<s> I'd suggest simply deleting the optional elements of the transformation rules, and picking just one of the possible alternative transformations.  </s>
<s> If there's anything else useful to be said, indicate it separately as additional information, with appropriate commentary.  </s>
<s> Concerning: Table row 3: Annotation(ontologyPropertyID URIreference) Doesn't obviously match an abstract syntax production.  </s>
<s> I think the URIreference should be ontologyId.  </s>
<s> (I recognize these resolve to the same thing, but if one is going to go to the trouble of defining a heap of equivalent symbols, they might at least be used consistently.)  </s>
<s> In reading the transformation rules, it is not immediately obvious from the table as presented what parts of the abstract syntax expression are variables that are carried into the transformed expression, but when getting down to the level of trying to code an implementation it seems clear enough what goes where.  </s>
<s> Some more explicit convention for naming "variables" in the transformation rules might help.  </s>
<s> I *think*, though it's not exactly clear, that the third column indicates what part of the transformed expression to use for the  </s>
<s> node when T(expr) appears as a node in a triple for a transformed  </s>
<s> piece of syntax.  </s>
<s> I think this piece of text: The left column of the table gives a piece of syntax (S), the center column gives its transformation (T(S)), and the right column gives an identifier  </s>
<s> for the main node of the transformation (M(T(S))), but only for syntactic constructs that can occur as pieces of directives.  </s>
<s> could usefully be expanded.  </s>
<s> I think something like this is intended:  </s>
<s> The table has three columns: 1. gives a piece of abstract syntax corresponding to an abstract syntax production rule (with further nonterminal symbols in an italic font) 2. gives a transformation of the abstract syntax into RDF triples, where the triples are presented as N-triples (with qnames for URIs).  </s>
<s> Within these, further transformations, expressed as T(...), may be used to represent RDF triples, and also to represent individual nodes within such triples.  </s>
<s> 3. gives a node identifier to be used when a transformation of the corresponding abstract syntax is used as a node within a triple in some other (middle column) transformation expression.  </s>
<s> The resulting RDF graph contains all of the triples generated by the transformation of a given piece of abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> (This may not be the best possible description, but I think something at this level of detail would make the intent very much clearer.)  </s>
<s> AFAICT, the mapping table is presented in the same order as the abstract syntax production rules, with a 1:1 correspondence.  </s>
<s> This is an important clue, which I think would be better if made explicit by (a) labelling the abstract syntax productions, and (b) using those labels to identify the corresponding mapping rules.  </s>
<s> I think the handling of the ontology node in the first two rows is not entirely consistent with the treatment later given to other constructs that result in the generation of new blank nodes.  </s>
<s> (In my implementation sketch, I pass the explicit-or-generated Ontology node as a parameter to the subsequent transformations.)  </s>
<s> Concerning: This gives some rules to determine whether some RDF graph is an Owl-lite or Owl-DL ontology.  </s>
<s> Presumably anything that doesn't satisfy either of these criteria is Owl-full.  </s>
<s> But the rules are stated in terms of an AS- Graph transformation, so I'm not sure they constitute an effective procedure for making such a determination.  </s>
<s> There's a point that isn't entirely clear to me: "the ontologies in O taken together provide a type for every individual ID" What about mixtures of arbitrary RDF and OWL ontology statements?  </s>
<s> Does this mean that every individual must have an explicit type statement?  </s>
<s> Exactly what counts as an individual for the purposes of this assertion?  </s>
<s> It has been my assumption that the various flavours of OWL can be used as a  </s>
<s> "logical layer" to perform some reasoning about things described by common-or-garden RDF.  </s>
<s> I've since been told this may not be so.  </s>
<s> If it is true that Owl DL and Owl-lite are not suitable for doing any reasoning  </s>
<s> about things described by ordinary "in the wild" RDF, I think this needs to  </s>
<s> be clearly stated.  </s>
<s> For interest, the attachment to this message is the start of a sketch for implementing the (section 4.1) transformation rules in Haskell.  </s>
<s> The first part of the code is an encoding of the abstract syntax using Haskell data types.  </s>
<s> The second part are some clauses of a Haskell function "transform" that implements the transformation T described by the mapping table, corresponding to the first 6 rows of the table.  </s>
<s> The code is far from complete, and hasn't been near a Haskell compiler.  </s>
<s> But I now think I see enough to complete the implementation.  </s>

<s> This bit has been changed to The left column of the a href="#transformation" table /a gives a piece of span class="change" abstract /span syntax (S); the center column gives its transformation span class="change" into triples /span (T(S)); and the right column gives an identifier for the main node of the transformation (M(T(S))), for syntactic constructs that can occur as pieces of directives.  </s>
<s> The new version is available at The information about how the triples are represented is contained in a paragraph shortly after.  </s>
<s> There is no strict correspondence between the syntax production and the mappings so this labelling would not work out.  </s>

<s> Thank you for your consideration.  </s>
<s> For the purposes of formal process, I find your response is satisfactory.  </s>
<s> There are, however, a couple of clarifying points I'd like to make concerning your response, which you may choose to ignore.  </s>
<s> I accept the point that it is possible to implement a reverse transformation (rdf - owl) that satisfies the rules given, and that any such transformation satisfying the relationships defined by the rules will assign consistent semantics to the original RDF.  </s>
<s> In that respect, I agree that specification is sufficient as a formal description of what must be done.  </s>
<s> My concern is the possible difficulty of such a transformation.  </s>
<s> To deploy a technology at Internet scale, not only must it be possible to implement, but I believe that the possible means of implementation must be sufficiently clear that one does not need to be a researcher at the forefront of the corresponding technology in order to construct such an implementation.  </s>
<s> Standardization is an engineering process, not research.  </s>
<s> If the engineering involved to deploy a standardized technology is not sufficiently clear, I see two likely consequences: (1) developers simply do not bother with the standard concerned, and do their own thing.  </s>
<s> (2) developers try, and get it wrong, resulting in widespread deployment of non-interoperable implementations.  </s>
<s> Tempered by the above considerations, I do acknowledge and accept your comment:  </s>
<s> (I could not access that document, but the approach you outline seems fine.)  </s>
<s> I have taken a look at your [3] and still certain aspects of the role of OWL vis-a-vis RDF were not entirely clear.  </s>
<s> Maybe it helps if I try to explain why.  </s>
<s> My uncertainty centres on the role of an "OWL document".  </s>
<s> I see a conceptual distinction between two uses of RDF: (1) "raw RDF data": used to describe things and concepts in the "real" world.  </s>
<s> Some examples we have seen are: tables of airport locations, tables of geopolitical information, descriptions of meeting agenda and participants, personal information associated with a web homepage, and so on.  </s>
<s> This kind of information, considered alone, contains no basis for anything more than the most primitive of logical reasoning.  </s>
<s> But I expect an overwhelming majority of RDF data available from the web to be such information, and the utility of Semantic Web technology to be driven by such availability.  </s>
<s> (2) "RDF logic decription": specialized RDF vocabularies, with corresponding additional semantics, that are used to provide information about other RDF vocabularies, and provide the basis for reasoning about "raw RDF data".  </s>
<s> Examples of such would be RDF schema, OWL, the logical rules vocabulary implemented in CWM, etc.  </s>
<s> My expectation about an "OWL document" had been that it applies to presentation of a particular style of "RDF logic description", which an OWL reasoner can combine with arbitrary "raw RDF data" to draw new conclusions about the things described there.  </s>
<s> So an OWL document that says that a cat is a kind of animal combined with raw RDF data that asserts that I own a cat can be used by an OWL reasoner to deduce that I own an animal.  </s>
<s> My uncertainty from reading the OWL specifications is that it is not clear to me whether or not the data that an OWL reasoner can process must *all* conform to the OWL abstract syntax, though the implication seems to be that it must.  </s>
<s> To my mind, this raises a real possibility that a large amount of RDF published on the web will be opaque to (say) an OWL-DL reasoner.  </s>
<s> There is, I believe, a lot of RDF data published on the web that does not have explicitly an rdf:type property on every thing described (though these could often be inferred given appropriate RDF schema information and an RDF schema reasoner), yet the OWL specification seems to say that this type information must be explicitly provided for the raw data to be accessible to an OWL-DL reasoner.  </s>
<s> It may be that I'm not properly understanding the OWL specification, but I do think this is a sufficiently important issue that the future relevance of OWL will be well-served if the relation between OWL ontology descriptions and the form of raw data consumed by an OWL reasoner is more clearly stated.  </s>
