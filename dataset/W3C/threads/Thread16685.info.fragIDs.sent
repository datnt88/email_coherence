Amazon Access: How Accessible? 
By Kendra Mayfield 2:00 a.m. 
Dec. 20, 2001 PST Amazon.com's new site for the blind or visually impaired doesn't deliver the goods, critics say. 
The streamlined, alternative version of its text-only site has less text and graphics, which company executives hope will make it easier for visually impaired users using screen readers or other access software to shop online. 
But instead of improving access, critics say that Amazon has simply created a "second-best" alternative to Amazon's (AMZN) main e-commerce site. 
"On any number of levels, this is the wrong approach," said Joe Clark, an accessibility consultant and author. 
"Having a separate, text-only site with no graphics that's hidden from view where you can't do the same things as you can on the real site is the wrong idea."

The site includes fewer links on a page and fewer search results, allowing users to get through a complete page in a shorter period of time. 
While it might take 4 to 5 minutes for customers using screen access software to navigate through Amazon's main site or text-only site, they can peruse Amazon's Access site in well under a minute. 
"It's a much different experience when you have just a few links on a page," Frederick said. 
Accessibility experts have pilloried Amazon's new site since it launched quietly earlier this month. 
Critics say that the site lacks some of the most basic elements of accessibility design. 
"Though someone claims that this website was created for people with disabilities, I don't believe it," Jim Thatcher, an accessibility consultant, said in an online discussion. 
"They have done none of the simplest things, like labeling input elements or 'alt text' on the one or two images that appear on every page. 
I believe this is an experiment for a site for small devices. 
If it were done for people using screen readers, don't you think at least the 'alt text' would have been added?" 
"It was not made for accessibility," Clark agreed. 
"It was made for wireless devices." 
By removing some of the graphics and text from its Access site, Amazon has removed some of the information about products and services that are available on Amazon's main site, Clark said. 
But while the Access site doesn't offer all of the same services as Amazon's standard site, it has been customized for those using screen access software, Frederick said. 
Customers may get an entirely different experience, depending on what type of browser or software they use to access the site. 
Users can still browse, search for items and receive personalized recommendations, just as they can on Amazon's main site. 
"It's the same functionality, but it's just a different experience," Frederick said. 
"It's not everything, but it does have the features that our customers are most interested in. 
It's completely tailored for a specific type of user." 
Amazon said some visually impaired customers will still prefer to use its text-only site, which has been in place since the company was founded in 1995. 
"We anticipate that some users will gravitate to the Access site, but we're not expecting everyone to use it," Frederick said. 
"There may be some features that they would like to add. 
We hope that they would use the text-only site for that." 
But critics say that designers should focus on creating a single, fully accessible website, rather than creating alternative sites. 
According to the W3C guidelines, developers should create an alternative solution only as a last resort: "Content developers should only resort to alternative pages when other solutions fail because alternative pages are generally updated less often than 'primary' pages.... Before resorting to an alternative page, reconsider the design of the original page; making it accessible is likely to improve it for all users." 
"Providing an alternative version of the site is not the preferred solution," Denise Wood, a lecturer at the University of South Australia, said in an online discussion. 
"We need to aim to provide one accessible site for all users. 
While it is commendable that Amazon (has) at least developed a website that is more accessible, this should have been a consideration for the main site rather than as a second-best alternative." 
Accessibility expert Kynn Bartlett disagrees, however. 
"Alternative versions of websites are not only a good idea, they're a great idea and are necessary for the evolution of the Web and for continued access to content by people with disabilities," he said. 
It's easy for companies like Amazon to provide alternate interfaces for various users, including those with disabilities, non-English speakers and hand-held users, Bartlett said. 
"The bigger challenge -- and this is where Amazon may have fallen short -- is understanding how best to tailor those alternate interfaces to the needs of the specific user group," Bartlett said. 
Critics say it would be easy for Amazon to fix the problems with its main site by adding "alt text" on titles and skipping navigation links. 
Unlike multimedia sites, which are often difficult to make accessible, e-commerce sites like Amazon.com are easy to remedy, Clark said. 
"The idea that e-commerce sites are hugely inaccessible simply isn't true. 
The inaccessibility could be fixed readily. 
Any qualified accessibility expert could fix the problems on the Amazon homesite in about an hour." 
Still, some applaud Amazon's efforts to address accessibility issues. 
"I believe that this shopping site is an order of magnitude more accessible than almost all other shopping sites, certainly all major shopping sites," Thatcher said. 
"They have tried to present the essence of Amazon.com without all the glitz, and I think they have done a very good job of that." "Let's not be too quick to condemn Amazon for their goals, even if their implementation may need work," Bartlett said.

My full comments may be interesting, as we're still discussing the topic of multiple "versions" (not the best term) of a site -- or at least Scott still is. 
:) 
Are alternative versions of websites necessary or even a good idea? 
Alternative versions of web sites are not only a good idea, they're a great idea and are necessary for the evolution of the web and for continued access to content by people with disabilities! 
When the W3C's web content accessibility guidelines were written, the only workable model was a single, static source which was intepreted by an intelligent user agent. 
The assumption was that accessibility would result from the accessible content being translated into whatever the user requires for access. 
This has proven to not be a workable solution for a number of reasons -- including the cost of development of specialized browsing software and assistive technology, lack of consistent and implementable specifications, and the simple fact that HTML is a poor language for expressing transformable web semantics, but it's too entrenched to replace now. 
This means that it makes sense, whenever possible, to shift the burden back to the server. 
Servers are cheap and easy to upgrade, compared to deploying new software or hardware to every user out there. 
Intelligent servers can carry the burden of access easier than intelligent browsers -- and right now, we don't have anything even approaching an intelligent browser available, as the leading browsers all fall short on implementing the basics of web standards. 
The increasing use of database-driven template systems and content management software on major web sites makes it easy for companies like Amazon to provide alternate interfaces for various users -- be those users with disabilities, with non-English primary languages, with hand-held devices, and so on. 
A dynamic, up-to-date, and complete alternate web site should be no more than a case of simply configuring a new template, with the 21st century server systems available today. 
The bigger challenge -- and this is where Amazon may have fallen short -- is understanding how best to tailor those alternate interfaces to the needs of the specific user group. 
The W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative has concentrated on "one size fits all" design, which means there is very little guidance which says how to design user interfaces _only_ for blind users. 
It's not as easy as just removing graphics or substituting alt text, but this is an area that still needs a lot of research and investigation before the problem will be solved. 
Dynamic generation of web sites opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for greater access, and this is just the start of sites designed with the user's needs foremost. 
Let's not be too quick to condemn Amazon for their goals, even if their implementation may need work.

Oh, BTW, it clearly _is_ a wireless device site--but that's not necessarily bad; notice that the WAI EO documents are full of references to the fact that accessible design for wireless devices is very similar to accessible 
design for people with disabilities. 
Why do I say clearly? 
I just got around to looking at it, and I ended up at this URL: Note the "pocketpc".

maybe that has something to do with the problem, the "pocketpc" is not the same as PalmOS or Mac or Linux or anyone of a dozen other operating systems, and/or browsers????????? which is another whole slew of problems, when one companies marketing system makes (forces) other companies to cater to a single operating system no matter how flakey without regard to all of the other systems and browsers out on that big WORLD wide web Bob ASCII Ribbon Campaign accessBob NO HTML/PDF/RTF in e-mail accessys@smartnospam.net NO MSWord docs in e-mail Access Systems, engineers NO attachments in e-mail, *LINUX powered* access is a civil right THIS message and any attachements are CONFIDENTIAL and may be privledged.
