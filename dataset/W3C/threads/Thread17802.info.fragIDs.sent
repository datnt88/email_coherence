<s> I would like to propose that we accept the recommendations of the MathML subgroup to: 1. Require full implementation of MathML 2. Require integration of MathML elements into the DOM On the issue of navigation I propose: Place navigation of mathematical equations in the techniques document under the appropriate checkpoints (i.e. DOM navigation and sequential access to elements) Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign 1207 S.

<s> Could you give us a little more detail for your opinion.  </s>
<s> Does the current DOM specification not support MathML?  </s>
<s> (i.e. are we trying to use DOM for something it does not support in the specification) Does the current DOM specification support the special API?  </s>
