Are there any accessibility issues regarding the citation of URLs, both online and in print? 
We've been having some discussion locally about the conventions for our newsletter. 
The following have been suggested: www.foo.com 
The final alternative, with a Courier font, has been suggested as it's 
shorter than the others. 
Would this cause any accessibility (or other) problems?

The last one although shorter is not automatically recognised by email clients and browsers as a URL, and therefore appears as non-active in the screen. 
I think this is a disadvantage, which forces everyone to cut/paste or type the URL for activating it. 
Particularly problematic for "slow-typing" users. 
Among the rest, I think second one is best from a visual perspective, but I do not know how this http://www.foo.com/ might sound when rendered by a screen reader.

Just my two cents: Many URLs don't start with "www.", for example, just "aware.hwg.com" is (just a little) ambiguous. 
Many word processors and email programs (and more software in the future to 
be sure) will convert http://www.foo.com to a live hyper text link. 
They will NOT do this for www.foo.com. 
I see enough confusion between novices confusing email and web sites (as in "my web site is at novice@aol.com" or "our company's email is www.foo.com". 
Please don't contribute to this by omitting the "http" bit.

It all depends on the use, really. 
If they're going to be "clickable" or potentially so, in some way, then I recommend one of the first two. 
They have the advantage that the URL is clearly and cleanly delimited, since angle brackets can't be part of URLs without encoding. 
If you are going to use a URL "inline" in a sentence, it's best to use brackets as well, such as http://aware.hwg.org/ . 
If you didn't use it, the punctuation could be confusing. 
For uses in which the URL is set off from surrounding text, such as a signature or ad, you can go without the brackets, as in my signature file. 
I would avoid the use of simply the machine name part of the URL in print whenever possible, unless there's some sort of space limitations. 
On the radio or in person (voice), I suggest ALWAYS omitting the "http://" part _unless_ you're quoting something that doesn't start with "www" -- such as the AWARE Center site as has been noted already. 
(BTW, look for a new alternate URL soon with a www prefix.) 
Two more important things about URLs. 
If you can, you should learn how to do "redirects" on the server level -- sending a new HTTP "Location" header transparently. 
The reasons for this are: (1) You should never give out a long URL to ANYTHING, if you control the URLs, unless the URL will be clickable or pastable (and even then you might want to reconsider doing it). 
For example, let's say that I want to refer to something I wrote last year about voice browsers. 
I could use the following URL: That's very long, though. 
Imagine reading it out loud! 
My apologies to screenreader users! 
It will also be hard for someone to type from a magazine. 
Instead, I have used a feature on my server (Apache) to automatically redirect requests, transparent to the user. 
The line in my .htaccess 
file looks like this: Redirect /+voice http://www.hwg.org/opcenter/w3c/voicebrowsers.html 
This says "any requests for /+voice should be sent to the big long URL." 
This means that when I want to refer to the voice browser paper, I can use the following URL: Much easier, plus it's even readable! 
"dubba you dubba you dubba you dot kynn dot com slash plus-sign voice." [Why the plus sign? 
I give all my 'redirect links' a + prefix although it's not necessary. 
It helps with organization and looks unusual -- so I get asked what it means!] (2) If you are doing advertising of any kind, you will want to track the effectiveness of your ads. 
You can use redirects and the system log to do this. 
Let's say that I placed an ad in The WAI Journal of Accessible Web Design (no such thing exists, of course). 
I would set up the following redirect: Redirect /wai http://www.kynn.com/ 
This means that I would publish the following URL: My server would record this hit as a redirection, and would then forward it on to my main page. 
Thus, I know how many people reached me because of my ad in the WAI journal. 
I guess the latter isn't really an accessibility consideration, but the first one might be thought of as such. 
Anyway, hope this helps.

My personal preference is for http://www.w3.org/ separated from any punctuation by whatever means possible (including leaving a full stop off the end of a sentence) to be unambiguous.
