<s> The last one although shorter is not automatically recognised by email clients and browsers as a URL, and therefore appears as non-active in the screen.  </s>
<s> I think this is a disadvantage, which forces everyone to cut/paste or type the URL for activating it.  </s>
<s> Particularly problematic for "slow-typing" users.  </s>
<s> Among the rest, I think second one is best from a visual perspective, but I do not know how this http://www.foo.com/ might sound when rendered by a screen reader.  </s>

<s> Just my two cents: Many URLs don't start with "www.", for example, just "aware.hwg.com" is (just a little) ambiguous.  </s>
<s> Many word processors and email programs (and more software in the future to  </s>
<s> be sure) will convert http://www.foo.com to a live hyper text link.  </s>
<s> They will NOT do this for www.foo.com.  </s>
<s> I see enough confusion between novices confusing email and web sites (as in "my web site is at novice@aol.com" or "our company's email is www.foo.com".  </s>
<s> Please don't contribute to this by omitting the "http" bit.  </s>

<s> It all depends on the use, really.  </s>
<s> If they're going to be "clickable" or potentially so, in some way, then I recommend one of the first two.  </s>
<s> They have the advantage that the URL is clearly and cleanly delimited, since angle brackets can't be part of URLs without encoding.  </s>
<s> If you are going to use a URL "inline" in a sentence, it's best to use brackets as well, such as http://aware.hwg.org/ .  </s>
<s> If you didn't use it, the punctuation could be confusing.  </s>
<s> For uses in which the URL is set off from surrounding text, such as a signature or ad, you can go without the brackets, as in my signature file.  </s>
<s> I would avoid the use of simply the machine name part of the URL in print whenever possible, unless there's some sort of space limitations.  </s>
<s> On the radio or in person (voice), I suggest ALWAYS omitting the "http://" part _unless_ you're quoting something that doesn't start with "www" -- such as the AWARE Center site as has been noted already.  </s>
<s> (BTW, look for a new alternate URL soon with a www prefix.)  </s>
<s> Two more important things about URLs.  </s>
<s> If you can, you should learn how to do "redirects" on the server level -- sending a new HTTP "Location" header transparently.  </s>
<s> The reasons for this are: (1) You should never give out a long URL to ANYTHING, if you control the URLs, unless the URL will be clickable or pastable (and even then you might want to reconsider doing it).  </s>
<s> For example, let's say that I want to refer to something I wrote last year about voice browsers.  </s>
<s> I could use the following URL: That's very long, though.  </s>
<s> Imagine reading it out loud!  </s>
<s> My apologies to screenreader users!  </s>
<s> It will also be hard for someone to type from a magazine.  </s>
<s> Instead, I have used a feature on my server (Apache) to automatically redirect requests, transparent to the user.  </s>
<s> The line in my .htaccess  </s>
<s> file looks like this: Redirect /+voice http://www.hwg.org/opcenter/w3c/voicebrowsers.html  </s>
<s> This says "any requests for /+voice should be sent to the big long URL."  </s>
<s> This means that when I want to refer to the voice browser paper, I can use the following URL: Much easier, plus it's even readable!  </s>
<s> "dubba you dubba you dubba you dot kynn dot com slash plus-sign voice." [Why the plus sign?  </s>
<s> I give all my 'redirect links' a + prefix although it's not necessary.  </s>
<s> It helps with organization and looks unusual -- so I get asked what it means!] (2) If you are doing advertising of any kind, you will want to track the effectiveness of your ads.  </s>
<s> You can use redirects and the system log to do this.  </s>
<s> Let's say that I placed an ad in The WAI Journal of Accessible Web Design (no such thing exists, of course).  </s>
<s> I would set up the following redirect: Redirect /wai http://www.kynn.com/  </s>
<s> This means that I would publish the following URL: My server would record this hit as a redirection, and would then forward it on to my main page.  </s>
<s> Thus, I know how many people reached me because of my ad in the WAI journal.  </s>
<s> I guess the latter isn't really an accessibility consideration, but the first one might be thought of as such.  </s>
<s> Anyway, hope this helps.  </s>

<s> My personal preference is for http://www.w3.org/ separated from any punctuation by whatever means possible (including leaving a full stop off the end of a sentence) to be unambiguous.  </s>
