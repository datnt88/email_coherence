<s> Hi, I encountered the following bug with Amaya 2.4 (Linux binary distribution): The Character Style window is not displayed (when it should be) when the cursor is not visible, for example, when the document is scrolled and the cursor position moves beyond the visible part of the document.  </s>

<s> I guess it's a problem of focus.  </s>
<s> If the cursor is outside the document window Amaya doesn't receive the input and does do nothing.  </s>

<s> Other windows, such as the Colors window, are displayed regardless of whether the cursor position is visible or not.  </s>
<s> Also, the Style menu is always displayed when I click on Style, regardless of the cursor position.  </s>
