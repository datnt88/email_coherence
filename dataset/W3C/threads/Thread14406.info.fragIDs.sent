<s> The other requirements documents currently in development are Working Drafts, including: While there's nothing that prevents the Working Group from requesting publication as a Note, I recommend that you request publication as a Working Draft since this is a work in progress.  </s>

<s> At a later date, the WG may choose, to incorporate the requirements as an appendix to the WCAG 2.0 Recommendation.  </s>

<s> It would be more accurate to say that the access techniques relate to the  </s>
<s> DOM, rather than to any particular programming language, scripting or  </s>
<s> otherwise.  </s>
<s> Essentially, when a user agent executes a script or applet, it is the DOM interface which is used to manipulate the document and to ascertain the properties thereof.  </s>
<s> What is important is not the programming language being used, but the interfaces which are being relied upon that expose the structure and content of the document, and allow manipulation.  </s>
<s> Thus I would argue that the DOM is the relevant technology, and that the relevant programming languages (Java, Ecmascript, etc.), may be cited in examples.  </s>
<s> If there exist interfaces to the document that are not available across multiple programming languages (and I have not been informed of any), then these may be relevant independently of the DOM, though if they are non-standard then there may be limits to the extent to which we should address them in any case.  </s>
<s> We could perhaps say: techniques for client-side programming using the  </s>
<s> DOM, with examples in Java, Ecmascript, etc.  </s>
<s> This should explain the scope  </s>
<s> of the work item with sufficient clarity.  </s>
<s> DOM level 0 could then be considered, though naturally, most attention would be paid to DOM levels 1 and 2 (especially level 2 with its new, more generic, event set that offers real opportunities for device-independence and makes accessible client-side interactive applications feasible).  </s>
<s> 1. Add requirements beyond HTML and CSSWCAG 2.0 will include requirements for:  </s>
<s> HTML CSS SVG SMIL MathML Metadata  </s>
<s> DOM  </s>
<s> XML technologies (DTD authoring?  </s>
<s> namespaces?)  </s>
<s> Non-W3C technologies such as JAVASCRIPT, PDF, and Flash  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 requirements should be expressed in generic terms so that they may apply to more than one markup language.  </s>

<s> -- I would attempt to group the requirements functionally, not politically like this. -- for example, have a work item on forms.  </s>
<s> This group would work on fill-out forms -- in HTML, XHTML, PDF, and xHTML+JAVASCRIPT.  </s>
