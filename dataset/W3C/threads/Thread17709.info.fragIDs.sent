<s> In todays telecon we discussed having UA developer demonstrations of their products accessibility features during the breaks or evenings of the F2F meeting in October.  </s>
<s> It was felt like this was a good idea, but that there should be some guidance to the vendors on what they present.  </s>
<s> Particularly that presentations should be tied to the discussions of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> For example when we are talking about table rendering issues, that technology that has addressed table rendering could be demonstrated at that time or before that session discussing tables.  </s>
<s> There are several questions: 1.  </s>
<s> What times should the demonstrations take place?  </s>
<s> 2. What guidance should we give developers for their presentations?  </s>
<s> Please send your comments soon, since we need to get this organized.  </s>

<s> I plan to be at the face-to-face after CTG to demonstrate IBM Home Page Reader's features that illustrate implementations of the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> I think independent self-voicing browser vendors should be able to address how their browsers implement each guideline with few problems.  </s>
<s> However, which vendors will demonstrate how dependent browsers (Navigator, Opera, LYNX, I.E., etc.), which work with screen readers/screen magnifiers, implement each guideline - the browser vendors, screen reader/screen magnifier vendors, or both?  </s>
<s> I think it would be great to hear from both types of vendors.  </s>
