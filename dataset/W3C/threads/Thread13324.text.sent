This is email Bruce sent last year. 
I just tried out the test page with bobby 3.1 and the test page still gets a bobby approved when in actuality the links, which are images with alt="", are invisible.

My recommendation is that ALT="" should be illegal inside A HREF... Please check out: A totally inaccessible (but simple) page that flys through the W3C and Bobby validators with no problems. 
Even the verbose "Accessibility Recommendations" and "Accessibility Questions" and "Accessibility Tips" don't address what is the real problem with this page. 
Please note that I haven't touched this page in a while. 
The LONGDESC is implemented incorrectly (not that the W3C validator complains). 
Have other people designed pages to illustrate Bobby's short comings?

(215} 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) In the real world I strongly believe that it is not always possible to make ALT="" illegal inside a link, and I don't think there's an intrinsic problem when links on images that have ALT="" become invisible, *provided* that there is an alternative text link on the page to the same place. 
After all, surely the point is not that the exact same link should be used, but rather that the website should still be navigable, and if an accessibility aware designer wants to have it both ways, by putting their image-based links in one place and some text based links elsewhere on the same page, then let them. 
Some of the coders here at the BBC, who have to balance the fact that I will harangue them for producing something inaccessible on the one hand, but someone else will harangue them if the page doesn't look suitably over-designed on the other - a situation that I don't believe to be unique in real-world HTML - actually do deliberately put ALT="" in their image links, and use a bunch of invisible pixels with ALT="Suitable text for the same link" elsewhere on the same page, with a view to ensuring that the text-only version of the page is as useful as possible rather than having to rely on the happenstance of where the image based links ended up after being passed through Lynx, Betsie, or whatever. 
This may not be pretty in theoretical terms, but it means that the page is accessible to all, and surely that is the priority. 
In terms of Bobby, then, surely ALT="" in an image link should only generate an error if that is the only instance of that link. 
If there is another link to the same place, without ALT="", then there is no need to generate an error, since there is no error. 
IMHO.

The problem as Charles said is not fixable by automated checker but by author awareness. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
