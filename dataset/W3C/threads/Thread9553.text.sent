Jeremy, I came across this in some RDF Stuart has written: rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/" xml:base="http://example/org/base/" I wasn't sure whether the xml:base had any effect on the href. 
Brian Brian McBride said: Well, you addressed this to the group No. Since 1) xml:base applies only to fields that contain URIs that XML applications (RDF/XML here) know about. 
RDF/XML doesn't do that inside parsetype literal content. 
2) the a has no namespace. 
RDF/XML doesn't apply to non-namespaced elements anywhere 3) X/HTML don't use xml:base so even if it was an X/HTML fragment and element, it wouldn't apply. 
Dave Brian McBride said: Yup. 
Was thinking of Jeremy doing test cases for this, but I'm grateful for all input. 
Just so and RDF can't expect to about all those namespaces. 
But it occurred to me we could put an xml:base attribute on outer elements in the literal, the way we are doing with namespaces. 
I'm not suggesting this; just asking for my own education. 
And I wasn't sure about that. 
I believe HTML has a base attribute; I wasn't sure if they had endorsed xml:base. 
Thanks Dave. 
Brian I also think "No" but for reasons that perhaps I should have highlighted earlier: The exc-c14n spec says: The exclusive canonical form of a document subset is a physical representation of the XPath node-set, that is an octet sequence, produced by the method described in this specification. 
It is as defined in the Canonical XML Recommendation [XML-C14N] except for the changes summarized as follows: + attributes in the XML namespace, such as xml:lang and xml:space are not imported into orphan nodes of the document subset, and + namespace nodes that are not on the InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList are expressed only in start tags where they are visible and if they are not in effect from an output ancestor of that tag I see special treatment of xml:base as excluded by the first bullet point. 
Our resolution I think then prohibits an implementation that does import. 
If we had gone for inclusive c14n it would have gone the other way.
