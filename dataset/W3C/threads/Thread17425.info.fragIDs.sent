<s> Hi John, Thanks for checking out the site.  </s>
<s> At the moment the markup validates agains the chosen DOCTYPE (although the DOCTYPE used will probably change shortly, as this is an area of heated debate), and for those who will be checking it against Bobby it is AAA approved (although that doesn't mean it is definately accessible).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately I did introduce a few HTML errors when adding the news to the home page about the launch - but these have now been fixed.  </s>
<s> All comments are of course welcome; please e-mail any typos, or errors you find on the site directly to me, and I will try to get them fixed.  </s>
<s> This website design is really just a draft - so please don't be too critical of it; I know it isn't a fantastic design.  </s>
<s> Please join the Guild and make your talents available so that we can have a website that reflects the aspirations of the organisation.  </s>
<s> It is a membership organisation - and will will stand or fall on the enthusiasm, skills and commitment of the members.  </s>
<s> In relation to the design, the intention is to (very soon) have an open competition to create a design that reflects the message of the Guild.  </s>
<s> The design as it stands at the moment will be replaced within the next couple of weeks with an alternative (though still temporary) design that a current member is putting together now.  </s>
<s> There is no need to stand on the sidelines explaining why you think it is not good - please join, sort out the problems as you see them, and help to ensure that we raise each others skills and end up with more websites that are accessible.  </s>

<s> Hi Harry, You will be happy to know that your concerns are shared by many of the current members of the Guild - and that participation by disabled people, and user testing, has certainly been on the agenda, and is still on the agenda.  </s>
<s> I would encourage you to join - as your thoughts and contribution to the development of the Guild will be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> Where on the site is the phrase 'the disabled'?  </s>
<s> As someone who is very aware of the 'social model of disability', it is a phrase I am unlikely to have used myself.  </s>
<s> What the Guild is, or what it stands for, is not summed up by the few remarks that I have written on the home page of the site - if you have a look at the discussion forum at http://www.accessifyforum.com/forum15/,  </s>
<s> you will see that all of the issues related to accessible web design, and the Guild are hotly debated.  </s>
<s> The Guild of Accessible Web Designers is not a private organisation that dictates to its members what to think - the membership is the organisation.  </s>
<s> Please join so that you can be sure that it really does address the concerns you have.  </s>
<s> The membership form can be found here: All the best, Jim  </s>

<s> Pat, I don't suppose you can tell me any info on approved Accessible Web Design courses.  </s>
<s> They are mentioned on the GAWDS.org web.  </s>
<s> I was naively unaware that they existed and would be very interested in any info your have on them... Cheers Ben  </s>
<s> Ben, The use of the phrase 'approved' - is a little misleading - as we are not thinking of any particular course, and are not aware of any approved courses.  </s>
<s> It is there as an 'aspiration'; the Guild may want to develop a course of its own in the future, or may be a good organization to 'accredit' existing courses.  </s>
<s> All of this is up for debate.  </s>
<s> Whether the Guild is in a position to accredit other courses, will of depend on whether it is seen as being a credible organization itself - and that will depend on the how it develops, and who the members are - among other things All the best, Jim Pat, I don't suppose you can tell me any info on approved Accessible Web Design courses.  </s>

<s> I must agree with Harry.  </s>
<s> On Thursday last I gave a talk to the BCS in Preston on the rteasons for and ways of making accessible.  </s>
<s> The after talk discussion (continued in the pub) tried to find a better word for 'accessible'.  </s>
<s> We tries 'usable' but that needs qualification.  </s>
<s> My premise is that if you design to standards, no layout tables, no frames, no proprietary code, validate both your code and CSS in other words follow the specs you get accessible sites - and these sites work on devices for the 'disabled' and for mobile computing, pervasive computing, webTV and all that sort of thing.  </s>
<s> For instance thin about an Internet enables car - you talk to a computer and ask a question about road traffic conditions - the web page then speaks back to you the answers.  </s>
<s> Cloud Cuckoo Land?  </s>
<s> Maybe not, think about how you could verbally ask for road traffic reports from acomputer and not have to wait for the radio - for me I'm usually alerted just when I've passed the last turn off I could have taken to escape the problem.  </s>
<s> This type of page is also accessible.  </s>
<s> I just wonder if setting up a separate organisation calling itself 'accessible' is the right way to go - there should really be no discrimination in the first place.  </s>
<s> We have to concentrate on the user's requirements, no matter what they are, which browsing device they are using, where they are - I really do think that 'accessible' has become a convenient watchword for a certain way of testing (not working) and has lost the emphasis on 'design for all' (don;t like the phrase, but it's the best i can come up with at the time) My qualifications?  </s>
<s> I teach web programming to first year BSc students (among other things) and have succeeded in making them code in XHTML and CSS2 from day 1.  </s>
<s> After 10 weeks I'm getting a web page assignment set that's valid, accessible, attractive, cross-browsing device - everything you need.  </s>
<s> I don't tell them it's accessible or any other artificial title - just that this is the way that they have to design web pages.  </s>
<s> They have stylesheet switching to change colours and type size, they have stylesheets that cascade via @import staements, they have done very well indeed.  </s>

<s> My understanding is that terms like "Universal Design," "Universal Access," "Access for All," and "Barrier Free" can all be used synonomously with "Accessibility for people's with Disabilities."  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, they can also be used to mean different things.  </s>
<s> In Hong Kong, for example, "Barrier Free" and "Access for All" refer NOT to Accessibility for People with Disabilities - they refer to an effort to get all economic classes of people, and differently-educated people into the world of Technology - in other words, these phrases are being used for "The Technological Divide." "Universal Design," from a Usability worldview, is probably more of a superset that includes usability for people's with disabilities, but is not restricted to those users.  </s>
