<s> (Of course the LONGDESC attribute will still be used.) Roberto: This is my *personal* opinion.  </s>
<s> In this case, i personally suggest (for international conformation) to use the "d" instead the "b" because is important to mantain an uniformity of the use of the code.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, for example, here in Italy we must use the "p"... and this can cause problems for people that visit international web sites and (i think) also for some application that recognize the [D].  </s>

<s> Chris, I would suggest to stay with the "D".  </s>

<s> Consultants and web agencies widely recommend using the "D" here - so do we.  </s>
