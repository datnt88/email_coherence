<s> Hello, I have been using Amaya to create some html-pages full of mathematical formula's.  </s>
<s> Since these have to be read by others, who don't use Amaya, how can I write out my files in a format that Netscape or Internet Explorer can read (for example with little gif's in the place of the formula's, or empty places, leaving the links as they are?  </s>
<s> Any help would be very much appreciated.  </s>

<s> TtH does netscape compatible Math.  </s>
<s> It is also IE compatible.  </s>
<s> It makes heavy use of tables so Amaya fails a lot.  </s>
<s> TtH follows W3C rules for HTML4.  </s>

<s> In reply to Reynier Peletier's query about how to make Amaya-generated documents that use MathML readable with non-MathML compliant browsers, I would suggest that he stick to old-fashioned approaches like latex2html until such time as the browser market catches up.  </s>
<s> I'm impressed by his statement that he was able to use Amaya's MathML authoring support effectively.  </s>
<s> I still haven't got the hang of it.  </s>
<s> Could he, or anyone else, explain succinctly how to quickly compose what I would express in TeX as $$ R^{\mu}\!_{\rho}{}^{\nu\rho} $$?  </s>
<s> A stumbling block has been how to put two symbols in a superscript.  </s>
<s> Getting the indices to line up properly is also... interesting.  </s>
<s> I'm also disappointed that Amaya has chosen to implement the "presentation" variant of mathematical mark-up rather than the content-oriented one.  </s>
<s> I would find the latter more natural (and more likely to be supported by aural browsers, not to mention future versions of latex2html).  </s>
<s> I understand it's only a prototype and that resources are limited, but still.  </s>
<s> (Will the new box model Ir?ne is working on be good enough to match the power of TeX's?  </s>
<s> _That_ would be interesting to have.)  </s>
<s> Back to Reynier's question: most people know that the img HTML element supports an attribute called "alt" that lets one supply an alternative for situations where the image cannot be displayed.  </s>
<s> Is there an easy way in XHTML to specify one or more "alt"ernatives for those browsers that don't support MathML mark-up?  </s>
<s> (One such alternative might be an inline image, but when using Lynx I'd actually prefer to see straight TeX or similar mark-up since the image won't display either.)  </s>
<s> If it turns out there is a good solution, maybe someone will actually implement it.  </s>

<s> Margins and paddings will help to improve the quality of displayed maths, but more specific work is needed to obtain the TeX's quality on the printer.  </s>

<s> One approach is to use the OBJECT element, to import the MathML content, and if it can't be handled use an object element inside it to render soe other kinds of content (image of the math, long wordy expression, latex, ...)
