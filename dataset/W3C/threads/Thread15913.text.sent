Folks, 1. 
I began by lamenting the fact that my company's Web site is still unaccessible since we don't have the staff to modify it. 
I wondered whether there might be a contract web authoring organization that might specialize in accessibility retrofits (so we can throw money at the problem to get it solved.) 2. This lead to the idea of fostering the growth of a few accessibility retrofit contract authoring companies. 
It would create jobs and allow corporations to fix the problem by throwing money at it, rather than developing internal expertise. 
3. I then realized that companies probably wouldn't want to hire a niche author - they want one authoring contractor to get the whole job done. 
A contractor that has expertise and respect in all aspects of web authoring. 
Hmm... sounds a lot like Universal Design. 
So here's the question - are we making any special efforts to reach out to contract web authors? 
All of the discussions I've noticed to date all seem to treat web authors generically, but it seems like some authors would be more valuable targets than others. 
Is there a contract web authoring association? 
A first step might be to target a large franchising organization like USWeb. 
WAI could develop inservice training materials (video, web page, in-person lectures at training sites). 
Delivering such training to an organization like USWeb would be a clearly defined goal. 
It should also be easy to measure impacts, since the company knows how many sites it designs, and surveys for accessibility could be conducted before and after the fact. 
I'd suggest that WAI approach USWeb or some similar company at a high level to start talks. 
At a low level, academics involved in WAI might want to "infiltrate" students as summer interns into large contract web authoring firms. 
Chris Hasser Chris, First let me tell you that your company is unusual in that you are willing to look for help for your site because is not accessible. 
My experience has been that even when a company wants to make their site accessible they DON'T want another company to do the retrofit, even when it is their specialty, they want the company that has the contract to maintain their site to do it. 
For free, of course. 
I would be interested in talking to other accessibility "retrofiters" like myself to see how they are doing with the current market, and if there's an association I would be interested in joining. 
Ditto for a listserv.

Mike Creating an Association and listserve would be a BIG undertaking, so before we go rolling off I think there are a couple of things to consider: 1) Is there an Association, or division of html/webauthors assn that covers this area? 
(I don't want to reinvent the wheel) (research needed) 2) Is there a listserv (ditto research) 3) If not where would we put it. 
(www3? 
ilusa.com?) 4) Where to get the money for it (grant writer? 
[I have one, but more is good]) 5) Who will maintain it (listserv)(webpage) And do we want to put in the time necessary to make it a sucess? 
I'm very interested and will start the research, and get back to you with the results. 
As to your comment on getting jobs if the company principals are disabled, I haven't run into that yet, being a small company or individual is much worse in my estimation.

This could be my cue. 
The HTML Writers Guild (www.hwg.org) is very interested in the accessibility issue and we're working to promote the concept within the industry and educate our members -- many of whom _are_ freelancers/contractors -- on the importance of designing for universal accessibility. 
I need to run off and do some user support in my "day job" at Claremont Graduate University right now, but when I get back, I'll write some more about the Guild's plans and activities in this area, including our "Accessibility Month" in April, and our Accessibility Guidelines Implemenation project.

Governing Board Member, HTML Writers Guild YES! Mike Burks w3c-wai-ig@w3.org w3c-wai-ig@w3.org before covers The entire month of April, 1998, has been designated "Accessibility Month" at the HTML Writers Guild. 
The purpose of this special month-long event is to highlight the value and importance of designing all web sites with complete accessibility in mind -- meaning, the pages you write should be equally useable in the latest versions of major browsers as in a voice-reader for the blind, or anyone else with a non-"standard" means of accessing the web. 
During the month of April, we'll be using the Guild's resources to educate both our membership, numbering over 58,000 web designers, and the web industry as a whole about this important issue, through a number of special projects and events. 
One of the primary focuses of Accessibility Month will be on the World Wide Web Consortium's guidelines for page authors, developed by the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). 
This set of recommendations provides web designers with valuable rules to keep in mind when designing a page with accessibility in mind. 
The WAI guidelines can be found at: Projects and events scheduled for Accessibility April include: * Announcement of the special month-long focus on accessibility on the Guild's monthly newsletter, and the HWG homepage * Interactive member chats on accessibility-related topics, with recognized authorities in the field as guest speakers and panelists * A complete retrofitting of the Guild's web site to ensure that the HWG complies with recognized accessibility standards * The creation of a special Accessibility Guidelines Implementation project, as members of the Guild tackle the issue head-on while crafting accessible web sites -- more details below The overall goal of Accessibility Month is to create a greater awareness, both within and outside of the Guild, of the need for and importance of accessibility considerations in web design. 
Questions regarding Accessibility Month can be directed to Kynn Bartlett, kynn@hwg.org. 
ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT The Accessibility Guidelines Implementation (AGI) project is designed as a way of "beta testing", in actual use on the "front lines" of web design, the WAI page author recommendations from the W3C. 
Any member of the HTML Writers Guild is welcome to participate in the AGI project, by signing up via email to agi-contact@hwg.org and stating a desire to implement the page author guidelines on a new or existing web site. 
Participants in the project will need to take notes on the process and provide feedback on the WAI guidelines. 
Web sites that take place in the AGI project will be linked to from the HWG's web site, as examples of effective web design that account for accessibility concerns. 
Complete details on the AGI project will be announced via the Guild's website on April 1, 1998; questions can be directed to the AGI coordinators at agi-contact@hwg.org.
