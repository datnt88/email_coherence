<s> First of all as a newcommer to this list I'd like to send my greetings to all its members.  </s>
<s> Now I can ask my question : DOM Level 3 introduces the method isEqualNode(in Node arg, in boolean deep).  </s>
<s> I do not understand the use of the boolean argument deep : "if true, recursively compare the subtrees; if false, compare only the nodes themselves".  </s>
<s> Now a little before in the specifications it's said that two nodes are equal is the "childNodes NodeLists are equal.  </s>
<s> This is : they are both null, or they have the same length and contain equal nodes at the same index".  </s>
<s> Now how can I test the equality of two child nodes without recursively calling isEqualNode ?  </s>
<s> So as I understand it it does not matter if deep is true or false, the general contract requires that recursion be done.  </s>
<s> What's your opinion about this topic ?  </s>
<s> Zeljko VELAJA  </s>
<s> The intent is that the "deep" parameter of isEqualNode is like the corresponding flag on cloneNode.  </s>
<s> If false, only the two nodes explicitly passed as parameters (and maybe their attributes; I'd have to check that) will be compared.  </s>
<s> If true, those nodes and all their children wil be compared.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Yet cloning a node with CloneNode's argument "deep" set to false will perform no cloning of the children (except for an Attribute).  </s>
<s> This is  </s>
<s> clearly specified.  </s>
<s> On the over side, as regards the contract of isEqualNode, the specification does not seem to consider a node's children equality as facultative and argument dependant ?? -----Message d'origine----- De : www-dom-request@w3.org  </s>

<s> Question for the DOM team: Is the problem that nobody had a good usage case for shallow testing of a node, or did this just fall through the cracks?  </s>

<s> Thank you for your answer : it gave me an occasion to update my PDF specs, which where from 14 january.  </s>
