<s> The grammatical error will be fixed in the next draft (due Friday).  </s>
<s> The agenda may not allow for a resolution on the quesion of DTDs in the next guidelines draft (due in a couple of days), and the issue of extending markup is almost certainly going to require further thought and revision.  </s>
<s> You may wish to track their progress through successive drafts, or via meeting resolutions and the email list archives, available from the Working Group's home page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU Prompting for language is required in order to meet the Web Content Guideline calling for language to be marked up.  </s>
<s> At the moment most specifics which are covered there are not repeated in the Authoring Tool Guidelines themselves, unless there are special requirements specific to Authoring Tools.  </s>
<s> I think the concern is addressed especially in checkpoints 2.2.1 - support accessibility features, and 2.3.2 - make use of accessible solutions, where necessary prompting for extra information.  </s>

<s> I propose that we actually adopt the following checkpoint for Guideline 2.1 - Generate standard markup 2.1.2 Provide a reference within a document to the DTD which has been used as a URI.  </s>
<s> Rationale: User Agents need to know how to interpret a document.  </s>
<s> Where, for example, several XML varieties are used, such as the modular HTML-in-XHTML which is being produced by W3C, or MathML/SMIL included in an HTML document, reference to the DTD is important for parsing it.  </s>
<s> Also, it is how a document is declared to be (for example) HTML 4.0 strict, and interpreted as such, or MYHTML, which incorporates several extensions, and for which the DTD is available at http://rubbish.com/my.dtd  </s>
<s> The use of a non-standard DTD has implications about how the content is to be represented, and it is therefore important to know what the correct DTD is.  </s>
<s> In HTML this is done by including a DOCTYPE declaration.  </s>
<s> XML uses namespaces.  </s>
<s> These are techniques.  </s>
<s> Question: Does reference need to include a URI?  </s>
<s> I am not sure.  </s>
