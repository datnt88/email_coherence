Jamie, thanks for your comments. 
The grammatical error will be fixed in the next draft (due Friday). 
The agenda may not allow for a resolution on the quesion of DTDs in the next guidelines draft (due in a couple of days), and the issue of extending markup is almost certainly going to require further thought and revision. 
You may wish to track their progress through successive drafts, or via meeting resolutions and the email list archives, available from the Working Group's home page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU Prompting for language is required in order to meet the Web Content Guideline calling for language to be marked up. 
At the moment most specifics which are covered there are not repeated in the Authoring Tool Guidelines themselves, unless there are special requirements specific to Authoring Tools. 
I think the concern is addressed especially in checkpoints 2.2.1 - support accessibility features, and 2.3.2 - make use of accessible solutions, where necessary prompting for extra information.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA 
I propose that we actually adopt the following checkpoint for Guideline 2.1 - Generate standard markup 2.1.2 Provide a reference within a document to the DTD which has been used as a URI. 
Rationale: User Agents need to know how to interpret a document. 
Where, for example, several XML varieties are used, such as the modular HTML-in-XHTML which is being produced by W3C, or MathML/SMIL included in an HTML document, reference to the DTD is important for parsing it. 
Also, it is how a document is declared to be (for example) HTML 4.0 strict, and interpreted as such, or MYHTML, which incorporates several extensions, and for which the DTD is available at http://rubbish.com/my.dtd 
The use of a non-standard DTD has implications about how the content is to be represented, and it is therefore important to know what the correct DTD is. 
In HTML this is done by including a DOCTYPE declaration. 
XML uses namespaces. 
These are techniques. 
Question: Does reference need to include a URI? 
I am not sure.
