Does anyone know anything about Internet Taxation? 
Or is it a hoax. 
As I work on the internet designing web sites, it seems it just may be pertinent. 
I just don't want to jump to conclusions if it is not a threat. 
I thank you for your input.

Open invitation -- for general discussions on web design issues, you can't beat the HTML Writers Guild's discussion lists. 
We have over a dozen special-topic lists and are about to launch new XML and Stylesheet lists; the question of internet taxation is a natural for the HWG-Business mailing list. 
For more details, please see: Apologies for the ObPlug!

WAI IG: Ditto what I said a moment ago. 
The WAI IG list has a large membership, and relies on people keeping on topic -- when people don't, we get complaints, justifiably. 
For follow-ups on issues not related to the list, please go off-line.
