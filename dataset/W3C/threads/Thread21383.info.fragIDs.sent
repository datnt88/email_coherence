<s> To test my Zope annotation server, I decided to upgrade to the latest amaya client (GTK Amaya 6.4 on linux).  </s>
<s> When it wasn't able to post annotations, I figured it was a bug in my server.  </s>
<s> As a check, however, I pointed amaya at the W3C annotest server.  </s>
<s> It wasn't able to post there either!  </s>
<s> Am I the only one who has seen this problem?  </s>
<s> Did something in amaya break between 6.2 and 6.4?  </s>

<s> Hello Brent, Concerning POST, nothing has changed in Amaya in these versions.  </s>
<s> Are you going through a proxy?  </s>
<s> Did you get prompted for authentication on annotest?  </s>
<s> I have no problems for posting to Annotest with Debian or Windows with my current Amaya.  </s>
<s> I fixed some problems related to the temporay name generation.  </s>
<s> Could you download and try the following Amaya (GTK Debian) snapshot and see if your problem still occurs?  </s>
<s> ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/amaya-GTK-6.4+.tgz Regards, -jose  </s>
<s> I'm not going through a proxy.  </s>
<s> I wasn't seeing the authentication box.  </s>
<s> It would just hang.  </s>
<s> Of course, I just tried it again today and now it seems to be working.  </s>
<s> Strange  </s>
<s> Well, I'm not seeing the problem anymore even with stock amaya, but I downloaded and tested your build anyway.  </s>
<s> One thing I've observed is that with your changes, amaya no longer crashes on certain annotations generated by annozilla.  </s>
<s> It doesn't correctly resolve the XPointer, but an orphan annotation is better than a crash  </s>
<s> I'll attach the RDF for this annotation.  </s>
<s> Should this be resolving?  </s>
<s> Is the fault in annozilla's XPointer generation or in Amaya's parsing.  </s>
<s> (Note: This is not a stock annozilla.  </s>
<s> It has Doug Daniels' enhanced XPointer stuff)  </s>

<s> Brent,  </s>
<s> Thanks for your answer.  </s>
<s> I checked the annotest server a couple of minutes ago and it's down.  </s>
<s> I asked Eric to look at it.  </s>
<s> Last Friday it was working for me.  </s>
<s> I should have tested it again before replying you.  </s>
<s> Sorry!  </s>
<s> I'll look at this in detail and answer you back.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
