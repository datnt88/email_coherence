Minutes from the meeting of 5 May are available at: m Was there a decision about combining the two checkpoints in Guideline 1? Cheers, Jan Yes we decided to combine them and began drafting proposed wording for the combined checkpoint. 
The issue of a visual vs a navigation structure was discussed. 
This came up when we were attempting to propose success criteria wording. 
Structure can be navigated without displaying the structure,thereby achieving the same function.
