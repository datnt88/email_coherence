hi all, Now we need a piece of text to go on the back of the card. 
Basically all it will do is have a two paragraph summary of the project and then point them to the site. 
so...what do we want to get people to do with respect to the site? 
- join in irc/w3c mailing lists/workshops/suggestions and questions public-esw/wiki - find stuff out reports, demos, developer page 
??more?? 
We could also have a slogan of some kind on the front of the card....what do you think? 
any suggestions? 
I rather like this para (from we're doing in the project: The period 2002-2004 will see the first wave of mainstream Semantic Web applications. 
SWAD-Europe's role will be to ensure that the critical technology components required for widespread Semantic Web adoption are readily accessible to European industry, consumers, and developers. 
This involves finding and maintaining a balance between "in-house" Open Source tool development, community building, outreach and evangelism, combined with more technologically advanced research and analysis to support and field-test Semantic Web standards. 
any other ideas? 
Thanks for any input, Libby 
Hi Libby, 
Both of those. 
As well as pointing people to the web site (find stuff out) we should encourage then to join us on public-esw to ask questions, let us know of relevant other work going on etc. (I have a preference for emphasising the mail list since I'm irc-challenged!). 
Sorry, I'm terrible with slogans. 
Sentiments along the lines of "making the semantic real" or "building a practical semantic web 1.0" might be suitable but I haven't got a good form of words. 
Agreed. 
That's a good paragraph. 
If there is space it would good to have a few more specifics points mentioned as appetizers to encourge people to follow up (by mail or web). 
For example, mention a few of the specific technology issues or investigations or applications. 
Doesn't need to be comprehensive just a few bullet highlights. 
For example: "Examples of the activities we are involved in include: - bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack - reviewing and developing tools for accessing, storing and search semantic web data - developing case studies and demonstration applications in areas ranging from thesaurus management to semantic blogging - a series of developer workshops on topics ranging from image annotation to calendaring. 
For more details on the full range of our activities visit list."

thanks Dave, that's all excellent :) I appreciate your help, Libby
