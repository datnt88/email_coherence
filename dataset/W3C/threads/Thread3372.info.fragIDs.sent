<s> hi all, Now we need a piece of text to go on the back of the card.  </s>
<s> Basically all it will do is have a two paragraph summary of the project and then point them to the site.  </s>
<s> so...what do we want to get people to do with respect to the site?  </s>
<s> - join in irc/w3c mailing lists/workshops/suggestions and questions public-esw/wiki - find stuff out reports, demos, developer page  </s>
<s> ??more??  </s>
<s> We could also have a slogan of some kind on the front of the card....what do you think?  </s>
<s> any suggestions?  </s>
<s> I rather like this para (from we're doing in the project: The period 2002-2004 will see the first wave of mainstream Semantic Web applications.  </s>
<s> SWAD-Europe's role will be to ensure that the critical technology components required for widespread Semantic Web adoption are readily accessible to European industry, consumers, and developers.  </s>
<s> This involves finding and maintaining a balance between "in-house" Open Source tool development, community building, outreach and evangelism, combined with more technologically advanced research and analysis to support and field-test Semantic Web standards.  </s>
<s> any other ideas?  </s>
<s> Thanks for any input, Libby  </s>
<s> Hi Libby,  </s>
<s> Both of those.  </s>
<s> As well as pointing people to the web site (find stuff out) we should encourage then to join us on public-esw to ask questions, let us know of relevant other work going on etc. (I have a preference for emphasising the mail list since I'm irc-challenged!).  </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm terrible with slogans.  </s>
<s> Sentiments along the lines of "making the semantic real" or "building a practical semantic web 1.0" might be suitable but I haven't got a good form of words.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> That's a good paragraph.  </s>
<s> If there is space it would good to have a few more specifics points mentioned as appetizers to encourge people to follow up (by mail or web).  </s>
<s> For example, mention a few of the specific technology issues or investigations or applications.  </s>
<s> Doesn't need to be comprehensive just a few bullet highlights.  </s>
<s> For example: "Examples of the activities we are involved in include: - bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack - reviewing and developing tools for accessing, storing and search semantic web data - developing case studies and demonstration applications in areas ranging from thesaurus management to semantic blogging - a series of developer workshops on topics ranging from image annotation to calendaring.  </s>
<s> For more details on the full range of our activities visit list."  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> thanks Dave, that's all excellent :) I appreciate your help, Libby  </s>
