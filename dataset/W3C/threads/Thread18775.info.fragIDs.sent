<s> In last weeks HTML working group meeting, I was asked about the WAI's interest in the possibility of HTML elements for marking up abbreviations and acronyms.  </s>
<s> I seem to remember that we briefly discussed this at the WAI meeting recently in Sophia, but can't find the details in the minutes other than: "Acronym element was accepted by HTML group so that proper pronounciation can be done".  </s>
<s> The ACRONYM element would be used together with the TITLE attribute to specify the expanded name.  </s>
<s> TITLE has been added to most HTML  </s>
<s> elements for the next version of HTML.  </s>
<s> On graphical browsers the idea is that it would be used for tool tips also known as baloon help which pop-up as the mouse pointer is held over the associated element.  </s>
<s> This is a technique commonly used for user interfaces.  </s>
<s> The HTML working group was unable to reach a concensus on the need for a specific element for abbreviations.  </s>
<s> Thomas Reardon (Microsoft) argued that there was no need since user agents would have access to dictionaries covering nearly all abbreviations.  </s>
<s> These dictionaries could in principle be used to identify the abbreviations without the need for explicit markup.  </s>
<s> What do members of this group think?  </s>

<s> Subject: Acronyms and Abbreviations?  </s>
<s> "Acronym element was accepted by HTML group so that proper pronounciation can be done".  </s>
<s> The ACRONYM element would be used together with the TITLE attribute to specify the expanded name.  </s>
<s> First, that misses the requirement.  </s>
<s> The pronunciation of NCIL is "nickel."  </s>
<s> That is not a TITLE.  </s>
<s> Acronyms need a more complex lexicographical record than is afforded by one TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> [snip] The HTML working group was unable to reach a concensus on the need for a specific element for abbreviations.  </s>
<s> Thomas Reardon (Microsoft) argued that there was no need since user agents would have access to dictionaries covering nearly all abbreviations.  </s>
<s> These dictionaries could in principle be used to identify the abbreviations without the need for explicit markup.  </s>
<s> What do members of this group think?  </s>
<s> Both "acronym" and "abbreviation" are too narrow to capture the true requirement.  </s>
<s> There is a general requirement to be able to annotate words with lexicographical expansions.  </s>
<s> These should be distinguished from navigation tags as a different class of navigand.  </s>
<s> The requirement that I have come across repeately in working across engineering sub-domains is the ability for the page author to make explicit to the dictionary service at the client side which of various extant meanings a given lexical graph is to mean.  </s>
<s> Consider it a jargon requirment.  </s>
<s> It means, "In this place, this term must be interpreted in accordance with [value or reference to] definition."  </s>
<s> This would provide the capability to link to preferred pronunciations of acronyms, etc.  </s>
<s> In plain text there are homographs.  </s>
<s> The requirement is to be able to override the default dictionary, not just to supplement it.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> The suggestion is that TITLE would be used for the full name, e.g. MIT becomes "Massachussetts Institute of Technology".  </s>
<s> For pronunciation I have been arguing for a new attribute, for encoding phonemic and prosodic info.  </s>
<s> This is still at an early stage of discussion though.  </s>
<s> The people I have been talking to don't consider acronym and abbreviation as navigation elements.  </s>
<s> Rather they are there for people to find the expanded form, and as an aid to user agents to speak the phrase reasonably.  </s>
<s> TITLE as used for tool tips or balloon help is intended in a rough sense to be used in this way.  </s>
<s> That is as a means for people to clarify the intended purpose/meaning.  </s>
