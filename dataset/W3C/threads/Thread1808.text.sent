Sorry for the missing subject in my previous posting :-) On behalf of Martin Wallmer: Hi, should a DAV:allprop SEARCH on a Delta-V enabled resource return all Delta-V properties as well? 
According to RFC 3253 3.11 Additional PROPFIND Semantics A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the properties defined by this document. 
This allows a versioning server to perform efficiently when a naive client, which does not understand the cost of asking a server to compute all possible live properties, issues a DAV:allprop PROPFIND request. 
PROPFIND should not return them. 
Is this true for SEARCH as well? 
Is there a need to define the behaviour for SEARCH as well? 
Regards, Martin Wallmer Research &amp; Development Software AG I agree with Julian. 
DAV:allprop SEARCH should be defined to have the same behavior as DAV:allprop. 
In particular, it should not search RFC-3253 properties. 
The current proposal for the next revision of 2518 is that it should only search dead properties and properties defined in RFC-2518. 
Cheers, Geoff I think we should make SEARCH compatible to RFC3253/ACL -- that is DAV:allprop behaves just like for PROPFIND. 
Wait-a-minute :-) Yes, it should SEARCH them (if used in the where clause). 
No, it shouldn't report them (when select uses allprop). 
sed s/search/report/ I was assuming that you were referring to a DAV:allprop in the "WHERE" clause (i.e. find this string in all properties). 
Thus my statement that "DAV:allprop SEARCH should not search RFC-3253 properties". 
If you were referring to the use of DAV:allprop in the "SELECT" clause, then as Julian points out, it should not report RFC-3253 properties (but should search whatever is specified in the WHERE clause). 
And Julian's sed statement is of course correct (thanks, Julian!). Cheers, Geoff Wait-a-minute :-) Yes, it should SEARCH them (if used in the where clause). 
No, it shouldn't report them (when select uses allprop). 
sed s/search/report/ Geoff, you can't have DAV:allprop in the where clause :-)
