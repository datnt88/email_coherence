I've now worked throught the last call issue resolutions, the comments after last call and the other things on my personal todo list and produced a new editor's draft: Detailed changes: I do have a few more doc-production things to fix such as spellings, some HTML etc. but that is pretty much it for now. 
I shan't be around for this week's Friday telcon and probably several after that although I will be online. 
So to move this on, I need some volunteers to review the changes. 
You can navigate to CVS differences from the last version starting at and then to (last WD was CVS 1.463, this is now 1.495) but maybe a HTML word-diff might help, if I knew how to make one. 
Dave tidy -asxml -wrap 1 does a word per line. 
The diff can be found at: Jeremy You can often get something serviceable by converting the HTML to plain text and doing a conventional diff on that.
