special needs teacher web accessibility consultant Apologies from me (And Gregory Rosmaita) - we will be hanging around airport check-in queues. 
With regard to Outreach updates, we have both been working with various teams at Microsfot, including Publisher, FrontPage, Office, and the MSN.com team (the people who do the msn.com home page). 
I haven't gathered any information on the groups I was looking for yet - I was waiting for the minutes to remind me which ones they were - and we have not started to write up the review document because people are still all on the road. 
Charles McCN The skeleton seems fine. 
I think Web Education Accessibility stuff (cf. 
Cynthia Waddell) need inclusion even though they are mainly policy-connected, since they will specify standards. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Further our discussion this morning about the components of a web accessibility curriculum, I have drawn up a list of eight "learning objectives" that I have used in my workshops and presentations. 
This list is not exhaustive. 
What other objectives might form part of a curriculum on web accessibility? 
By the end of a presentation or workshop, participants will... 1. Understand key concepts about disability and people with disabilities. 
2. Know the business case for accessibility. 
3. Understand the legal requirements for web accessibility. 
4. Be familiar with the assistive technologies and alternative access techniques used by people with disabilities to access the Web. 5. Recognize common barriers that people with disabilities encounter on the Web. 6. Know the principles of accessible (or universal) web page design (or... be familiar with the W3C Web Content Guidelines.) 7. Evaluate the accessibility of your organization's Web site. 
8. Improve the accessibility of your organization's Web site. 
It is not necessary to cover all objectives. 
Objective 2 may be excessive for web masters, but essential for company executives. 
Objective 4 would be inappropriate for a group of blind programmers, but the most important element in a presentation to web-based trainers. 
Note that these objectives only state what will be learned. 
They do not specific how objectives will be met. 
There are many ways to satisfy an objective. 
For example, to fulfill the fourth objective, the facilitator can: - Show a video that shows people with disabilities operating PCs. 
- Demonstrate assistive technologies. 
- Ask a sighted volunteer use a screen-reader equipped PC with the monitor off. 
- Lecture on assistive technologies, and distribute handouts. 
Depending on the audience and time available, means to satisfy the 6th objective might include: - Distribute the Quick Tip cards and discuss the ten points. 
- Present a mini-lecture on the Web Content Guidelines. 
- Present Chuck and Geoff's Curriculum. 
- Ask groups of participants to choose a section of the guidelines, study it, and summarize it for the entire group. 
Objectives 7 and 8 are experiential objectives, and would form part of a longer, more technical course. 
Alan Alan, Great suggestions. 
I'll build these into a draft page, and add in other suggestions if people post them in reply to your thread. 
I see what you mean about separating the objectives from the approach...

Yet another objective could be to understand how accessibility relates to usability and how it could be included as a standard part of usability evaluations.
