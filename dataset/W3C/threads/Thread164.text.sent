DAVE, I DOWNLOADED TIDY (GUI VERSION) AND RAN A WEB PAGE I HAD CREATED. 
IT CREATED A ERROR BECAUSE THE AMPERSAND(&amp;) WAS PART OF THE WEB ADDRESS. 
THE ERROR WAS IN LINE 10 OF THE ISLET FILE BELOW DUE TO VIRUS CONSTRAINTS, I CAN'T SEND THE PROGRAM. 
I LIVE IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND, USA. 
THE AREA IS KNOW FOR STEAMED CRABS.

No, you created the error and Tidy reported it! 
Instead of "http://www.altavista.com/cgi- 
bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&amp;kl=XX&amp;pg=q&amp;Translate=on" 
you should have "http://www.altavista.com/cgi- 
bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&amp;kl=XX&amp;pg=q&amp;amp;Translate=on" 
Or, even more accurately: bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&amp;amp;kl=XX&amp;amp;pg=q&amp;amp;Translate=on 
This contains all instances of "&amp;" escaped to "&amp;amp;", instead of just one.

The HTML specs require &amp; to be escaped, e.g. as &amp;amp; and browsers already know how to deal with this. 
Tidy is doing the right thing to make the document into valid HTML, however, Tidy does include a means to prevent &amp; from being escaped if you insist on this. 
Take a look at the quote-ampersand option.
