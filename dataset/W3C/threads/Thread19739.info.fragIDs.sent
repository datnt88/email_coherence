Hi, 
I downloaded W95 Amaya 1.1a, and it works almost fine. 
I had some troubles using it when my PC was pretty busy, I mean with lots of other windows and "processes" running. 
When this is the case, I have random behaviours of the system: - extremely slow display and scrolling - digits displayed in the scroll bar buttons - Amaya stucked or crash - system reboot This PC is "plain W95", with 32 MB memory. 
This sounds like a memory problem? 
When I dont have these kinds of troubles (i.e. Amaya running almost standalone ;-), I noticed the following problems: - some images are not displayed - color map is wrong, GIF and JPEG images are not displayed right. 
- some images in tables are not displayed at the right place (Irene, if you wish, I can send you the HTML code which produces the problem) 
- some images are not displayed with the right size (same thing for the HTML source) 
- Help/About Amaya makes an unreadable window to appear, with an unefficient "Confirm" button 
And at the end, just a few suggestions, to make Amaya more friendly to the basic W95 users: - provide an Amaya icon for the desktop shortcut 
- provide the Cut, Copy and Paste W95 keyboard shortcuts (^X,^C,^V), and make the clipboard shareable with W95 
- get the cheapest PC in a supermarket, and use it for testing ;-) 
Anyway, Amaya works, and that is good !

Hi Marc, 
Yes, it seems (and I think) that there is a memory problem and I dealing with it at the present time. 
I'm treating this problem too. 
Basically I need such comments to make Amaya be improved in the right way. 
If you explecitly give the height and the width of images in the HTML file, amaya takes into account these features and displays images with respect to this data. 
You can correct the size of images bu clicking in the image you want to resize and give the right height and width using the menu "attributes" (item height and item width). 
Yes, this bug is fixed now. 
Yes of course 
This will be done. 
The difficulty is that the user interface of Amaya does'nt based on resource files. 
And accelerators are not so easy to introduce in the run time, however this feature will be available in amaya. 
Good idea. 
Basically Amaya was developed on unix platform you can imagine the difficulty to adapt a dynamic user interface (on motif for example) to Widows. 
Thanks for your comments.

Marc. 
About the graphics display, is it possible that Amaya only uses a 16 color pallet? 
If so, that would explain the images variances. 
Yours, Lee.

Hi Marc, 
Yes, could you give me the URL.I'm not sure I could fix the problem in the new release but I will try. 
I'm quite surprised, there are so many cases where images are displayed with the right size. 
Let we know what's the particular case. 
Cheers Irene. 
I also have problems with extremely slow display and scrolling, and occasionally digits appearing in strange places, even when I have nothing but Amaya running on my W95 machine which also has 32M RAM.
