I have a meeting with AOL to discuss any access issues with their products. 
Not having personally reviewed AOL products in the last few months, I would like to have input from anyone who knows of current access concerns with AOL products. 
Jutta Jutta Treviranus jutta.treviranus@utoronto.ca Centre for Academic and Adaptive Technology University of Toronto One (possibly) serious sticky problem: Does AOL still offer a (graphical) DOS version of their software or was that just Prodigy?
