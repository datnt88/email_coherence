William, 
At the 23 August 2001 telecon [1] we discussed issue #4 [2] which you 
raised a while ago. 
The issue is as follows: 4. Semantics in style Issue 8 August 2000 - William Loughborough. 
If I use style to convey semantics, how do I pass along the semantics to someone who does not use style sheets? 
The class name is not something that gets shown to the user. 
There must be some way to convey intended semantics presented via presentation mode. 
The working group thinks this is closed as it is covered by checkpoint 1.3 (use structure), 1.5 (separate content and structure) and CSS 
techniques. 
Do you agree that this issue is closed? 
Could you help reframe the question so that we can attempt to address it? 
Thanks, --wendy [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/08/23-minutes.html#4

I suppose it's "covered" but an author who has created a style called "special" and then used that as the class modifier for a span is possibly unaware of the problem created thereby and not even aware that it has 
violated anything about "logical structure" or "separated content/structure". 
I guess it can't really be pinned down in GL/CP so maybe a mention of "class abuse" in connection with CSS in the techniques might be appropriate? 
So take it off the issues list if that's what folks want to do. 
Love.

You can't close this issue based on "content guidelines" alone; that is to say guidelines for what the publisher puts in the HTML pages that travel through HTTP alone. 
Closing this issue also involves techniques for the User Agent -- that in HTML, the 'class' tokens are part of the conditional content that should be inspectable on request pursuant to Checkpoint 2.3, independent of styling. 
See, for example where in [long and stammered URL warning] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010731/guidelines.html#gl-content-a ccess http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010731/guidelines.html#gl-conten t-access it says o (2b) provide access to C by query (e.g., allow the user to query an element for its attributes). 
[snip] The full strategy also involves techniques for how you use schemas; there is language in the imminent XML Guidelines pointing out that the schema should cover the intended meaning of the class codes and should provide brief definitions usable in user interfaces for authoring and browsing. 
What we haven't worked out is the best techniques for providing comparable normalization of categories and documentation of codes (such as class tokens used in legacy formats such as XHTML 1.1). 
And we [as in PF] need to work with y'all [as in GL] on that for sure. 
However, aside from specifically noting UAAG 2.3 this should all be agenda for future work and not immediate massaging of the WCAG 2.0 drafts.

And unable to fix it, even if they are aware of it. 
It is of course possible to link to some form of metadata about the classes that one uses in a document, but there are no standard methods for doing so, and hence no tools that can retrieve the definitions, yet alone do something with them. 
Hope that future standards such as XHTML 2.0 fix the problem.
