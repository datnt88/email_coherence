<s> Everyone who has tried to read the WAI recommendations knows that most people cannot use them "as is".  </s>
<s> The WAI itself has made a billfold card with a summary of recommendations, and I have heard of several organizations who are either planning or have in progress some work to make some intermediate readable translation of the full set of guidelines.  </s>
<s> I am distressed to hear that Ron has been ignored by the WAI in his attempt to help in the translation process.  </s>
<s> The WAI evangelization effort may need some improvement.  </s>
<s> At the very least, the WAI needs to be sure that efforts by Ron and others are coordinated, not ignored.  </s>

<s> Greetings, I tend to agree with Paul, the W3C stuff while very valuable to an experienced web developer, is almost useless for a lay person.  </s>
<s> Those of you who have heard my presentations on Web Access have heard this before.  </s>
<s> We have rewritten the guidelines to be more usable for our developers here at OSU, mostly faculty who know almost nothing about HTML code.  </s>
<s> We have found that almost anything that is produced for general consumption needs to be tailored to the specifics of your institution.  </s>
<s> We have approached the WAI with a more usable rewrite of their guidelines, and have never had a response.  </s>
<s> We wanted distribution permission to beta test the evaluation protocols we had developed, and basically got blown off by the WAI, despite talking to the folks in charge on more than one occasion.  </s>
<s> The other piece of misinformation that tends to get spread around is that accessibility does not cost anything.  </s>
<s> If you try to sell this to your institutional IS folks your credibility is going to take a nose dive.  </s>
<s> Making educational websites fully accessible adds 10-15% to the development time of the site, so logically it also adds correspondingly to the cost of overall development.  </s>

<s> I think their job -- which we probably agree was done almost perfectly -- was to specify exactly where there were access problems in content, browsers, and authoring tools, and what the corresponding solutions and approaches are.  </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, to my mind WAI documents are the best such job I've seen.  </s>
<s> Their completeness does in fact cause for problems in reading and implementing, for people who don't want to become experts.  </s>
<s> I think this category includes 95% of the people who we want to reach, such as your users.  </s>
<s> But that's not really WAI's fault.  </s>
<s> In fact, they did a good job of publishing the bare essentials on a business card.  </s>
<s> This format may be too brief, but it has gone a long way in convincing potential critics that the problems are not abstruse or insoluble.  </s>
<s> And I'll bet that if you -- or a bunch of us -- approached WAI with a proposal to extract, collate, index, and "leaven" their content for this semi-mainstream, non-expert large audience, they'd be entirely enthusiastic.  </s>
<s> I've done this for some corporate clients, who also like to fold in some of their own content for an intranet accessibility resource, and it's quite feasible.  </s>
