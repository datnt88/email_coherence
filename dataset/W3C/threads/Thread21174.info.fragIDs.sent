The Amaya team is proud to announce a new Amaya snapshot release. 
Binaries (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP /9x/ME) are available at: Source is available at: Debian packages are available at: This release mainly comprises bug fixes, among which: * Edition: auto margins were computed to early when the document includes tables. 
Transparency for PNG images on Windows platforms. 
* CSS: Background images declared in style attributes were not displayed. 
The CSS parser didn't accept attributes if they were not placed between quotes. 
CSS were not reapplied when background images are loaded. 
* HTTP: Content-Location headers that gave a relative URL were not being converted correctly into absolute URLS (related to publishing "page" rather than "page.html").

I'm a big arrow-key user. 
I like to keep away from the mouse, and use the arrow keys to navigate round a document. 
Amaya often gets stuck at a position when using the arrow keys. 
My daily routine includes: Put the cursor at the beginning of the last paragraph of a document (which is a one-line paragraph), [shift-downarrow] to select it, [copy], [downarrow] to go to the end of the document, [paste]. 
If I do an [uparrow] from here, it won't move. 
There are lots of other cases (play around, you'll find them; often involving being at the end of a line), but this one is reproducible.

I really like the 'edit and browse' logo 
and really don't like the standard Amaya cherry/apple tree logo, which is too detailed to look good on a small logo; I know it's meant to be a cherry or apple tree (though I don't know which) but I can't see it in the tiny logo. 
So, why don't you unify the branding of Amaya? 
Proposal: Take the Y of the Amaya 'browse and edit' logo and use it to represent a stylised tree. 
Add a red dot to it, to represent a stylised cherry and to maintain logo continuity, and use the result as a new Amaya logo. 
Add the cherry to the 'browse and edit' logo too. 
Best wishes, Steven Pemberton 
Hello Steven, 
I think this logo represents an exotic tree (for european people) called tamaya. 
We are thinking about a new Welcome Page for Amaya and we'll probably change the logo. 
Thank you for this very constructive proposal. 
Regards, Laurent 
Because of a confusion, an old Windows (NT, XP, 9x) snapshot (6.4+) was uploaded instead of the latest one (7.2+). 
If you have already it, open the Help / About Amaya menu. 
If it says 6.4+, you'll have to uninstall, download the snapshot again, then reinstall it. 
Sorry for the confusion and wasted bandwidth.

I also liked Stephen's positive suggestion ... but feel I must add a small caveat : That "Y" with a red dot as described sounds VERY familiar ... so there may be a conflict with a registered trademark "TM", and there may indeed be SEVERAL similar logos already in existance. 
But let us not STOP just because we need to check this out ... as (t)Amaya improves, maybe the logo should, too !
