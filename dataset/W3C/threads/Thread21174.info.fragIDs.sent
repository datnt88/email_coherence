<s> The Amaya team is proud to announce a new Amaya snapshot release.  </s>
<s> Binaries (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP /9x/ME) are available at: Source is available at: Debian packages are available at: This release mainly comprises bug fixes, among which: * Edition: auto margins were computed to early when the document includes tables.  </s>
<s> Transparency for PNG images on Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> * CSS: Background images declared in style attributes were not displayed.  </s>
<s> The CSS parser didn't accept attributes if they were not placed between quotes.  </s>
<s> CSS were not reapplied when background images are loaded.  </s>
<s> * HTTP: Content-Location headers that gave a relative URL were not being converted correctly into absolute URLS (related to publishing "page" rather than "page.html").  </s>

<s> I'm a big arrow-key user.  </s>
<s> I like to keep away from the mouse, and use the arrow keys to navigate round a document.  </s>
<s> Amaya often gets stuck at a position when using the arrow keys.  </s>
<s> My daily routine includes: Put the cursor at the beginning of the last paragraph of a document (which is a one-line paragraph), [shift-downarrow] to select it, [copy], [downarrow] to go to the end of the document, [paste].  </s>
<s> If I do an [uparrow] from here, it won't move.  </s>
<s> There are lots of other cases (play around, you'll find them; often involving being at the end of a line), but this one is reproducible.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Steven Pemberton  </s>
<s> I really like the 'edit and browse' logo  </s>
<s> and really don't like the standard Amaya cherry/apple tree logo, which is too detailed to look good on a small logo; I know it's meant to be a cherry or apple tree (though I don't know which) but I can't see it in the tiny logo.  </s>
<s> So, why don't you unify the branding of Amaya?  </s>
<s> Proposal: Take the Y of the Amaya 'browse and edit' logo and use it to represent a stylised tree.  </s>
<s> Add a red dot to it, to represent a stylised cherry and to maintain logo continuity, and use the result as a new Amaya logo.  </s>
<s> Add the cherry to the 'browse and edit' logo too.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Steven Pemberton  </s>
<s> Hello Steven,  </s>
<s> I think this logo represents an exotic tree (for european people) called tamaya.  </s>
<s> We are thinking about a new Welcome Page for Amaya and we'll probably change the logo.  </s>
<s> Thank you for this very constructive proposal.  </s>
<s> Regards, Laurent  </s>
<s> Because of a confusion, an old Windows (NT, XP, 9x) snapshot (6.4+) was uploaded instead of the latest one (7.2+).  </s>
<s> If you have already it, open the Help / About Amaya menu.  </s>
<s> If it says 6.4+, you'll have to uninstall, download the snapshot again, then reinstall it.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion and wasted bandwidth.  </s>

<s> I also liked Stephen's positive suggestion ... but feel I must add a small caveat : That "Y" with a red dot as described sounds VERY familiar ... so there may be a conflict with a registered trademark "TM", and there may indeed be SEVERAL similar logos already in existance.  </s>
<s> But let us not STOP just because we need to check this out ... as (t)Amaya improves, maybe the logo should, too !  </s>
