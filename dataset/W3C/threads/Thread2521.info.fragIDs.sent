<s> The following discussion has been going on privately, and needs a wider audience.  </s>
<s> I've assigned it the issue name REDIRECTS, and it will appear in the next issues list page.  </s>
<s> - Jim Gettys The HTTP spec says that redirects are to be limited to 5. We have found this causes problems with some sites, like pathfinder.  </s>
<s> We tried 10 but that didn't work particularly well either.  </s>
<s> So we currently have it set  </s>
<s> for 100.  </s>
<s> Is there any particular reason why we desperately need to lower that figure?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Yaron Each redirect causes additional network traffic; the limit is there to prevent an infinite loop causing infinite traffic to be generated.  </s>
<s> I'd like to understand what PathFinder is trying to do to understand what this limit might be lifted to.  </s>
<s> There certainly needs to be some limit of some sort.  </s>
<s> - Jim The argument I have been making with Larry is that we should define a minimum number of redirects to be supported by a client but should not put a maximum on servers.  </s>
<s> A server may have a perfectly rational reason for wanting to exceed whatever limit we have placed on redirects.  </s>
<s> However, for the sake of interoperability, a server needs to know what is the maximum number of redirects a client is guaranteed to support.  </s>

<s> You cannot force a user agent to make a network request (because it may cost them money), so you cannot guarantee that a client will perform a redirect without first asking the user for confirmation.  </s>

<s> X-UIDL: 6a4244389728a59ded607196a8bab141 Roy, do you even understand why your response makes me upset?  </s>
<s> Was that your goal?  </s>
<s> To state the painfully obvious as if it was relevant to the point under consideration is just asinine.  </s>
<s> Clearly the user can stop any operation.  </s>
<s> That isn't the issue.  </s>
<s> The issue is how many times will the system even give the user a choice to stop the operation before it steps in and stops the redirections itself.  </s>
<s> Currently we have set that limit to 5. I do not believe that is appropriate.  </s>
<s> Rather I think we should set  </s>
<s> the minimum to 5. That the system will present the user at least 5 redirections before just saying "Something has gone wrong, there is an error, I am ending this operation."  </s>
<s> In cases where the redirection is automatic, then the system would only be required to automatically redirect up to five times.  </s>
<s> BTW I am not asking for a UI requirement.  </s>
<s> It is completely appropriate for a browsers, in case of 302 on a POST or similar method, to never even present the redirect to the user for confirmation.  </s>
<s> This is certainly the case when running in batch mode, for example.  </s>
<s> However in cases where it is appropriate to present a dialog, at least five rounds of redirections should be supported.  </s>
<s> If the user wants to end the situation earlier than that, that is the user's prerogative.  </s>
<s> On to other issues, more as an editorial note.  </s>
<s> Some of the devs have not clearly understood that 301/302 means "Re-execute the method you just executed on this resource over on that resource."  </s>
<s> Some have thought, in fact, that what is really meant is "Re-execute the following method on this other resource" and wondered where the header was that specified what method they should actually execute.  </s>
<s> For example, you could tell someone doing a POST on resource A to instead do a PUT on resource B. I realize you will all think these people to be drooling morons.  </s>
<s> They are not.  </s>
<s> They are actually quite intelligent.  </s>
<s> The existence of their misunderstanding indicates that what is implicitly implied in the text, should instead be explicitly stated.  </s>
<s> In fact there was a bit of a flap over a fear that 1.1 servers doing 301/302s would redirect the user to a 1.0 server w/a CGI script expecting a GET.  </s>
<s> The problem is, that if a POST, on a 1.1 server, got you the 302, you will execute another POST.  </s>
<s> Thus confusing the living hell out of the target CGI.  </s>
<s> Then they made a number of proposals to deal with the situation.  </s>
<s> My response was to say "HELL NO! If a server maker is not aware of the effect of the responses they are generated, in this case needing to generate a 303, then they are broken, screw 'em."  </s>
<s> Should be interesting to see how that goes over.  </s>
