Hello, This email is part two of a series of emails about issues raised about the 7 July UA Guidelines [1] during an evaluation of MAC IE 5 [2] conducted with the lead developer, Tantek ?elik. 
Refer to part one [3] of this series for issues raised about Guidelines one through seven. 
This email covers issues raised in Guidelines 8, 9, and 11. 
While these are issues that could be raised during a last call review, some of them are directly related to our efforts to establish more precise requirements, and so I am sending them as part of the process of refining and clarifying the document. 
The issues follow my signature. 
Below, I summarize the seven issues that were raised. 
- Ian P.S. I hope to send the results of the review of Guideline 10 in the near future.

ISSUES Issue 1) Checkpoint 8.8 reads: Implement selection, content focus, and user interface focus mechanisms. 
Implement them according to system conventions per checkpoint 5.8. 
Proposal: Add a clarification that this checkpoint is about the semantics of these mechanisms (selection, focus) and not their presentation. 
Their presentation is covered in checkpoint 8.9. 
Issue 2) The definition of "recognize" needs review. 
I don't have a proposal right now. 
Issue 3) Define set of explicit submit controls for HTML Checkpoint 11.2 reads: Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit activation of a form submit control. 
Proposal: Add to the Note following the checkpoint that in HTML 4, the only explicit controls are INPUT type="submit" and type="image", and BUTTON type="submit". 
Issue 4) Change percentage back to proportion. 
Checkpoints 9.4 and 9.5 used to say "proportion" and now they say "percentage". 
I propose that was return to "proportion". 
For example, saying that 1 Mbyte of 10 Mbytes has been transferred is just as useful as saying 10% has been transferred, and it is also gives size information. 
Proposal: a) Change "percentage" back to "proportion" b) Give two examples of indicating proportion: percentage and "X of total Y". 
Issue 5) Definition of "stalled". 
Checkpoint 9.4 reads: 9.4 When transferring content (e.g., a document, image, audio, video, etc.) indicate what percentage of the content has been transferred and whether the transfer has stalled. 
Issue: What is the definition of "stalled"? 
What is the length of time before the transfer should be considered stalled. 
Proposal: Specify that user agents should refer to specifications of underlying protocols (e.g., tcp/ip) that may specify timeout parameters. 
I am not familiar with these specifications, so any advice (notably URIs) would be appreciated. 
Issue 6) Does relative position of the viewport include horizontal position? 
Proposal: Yes. 
In fact, the dimensions depend on the viewport. 
An audio viewport would not (I believe) have this issue since the output is one dimensional. 
Issue 7) General advice about implementation of optional features of a specification. 
Proposed: Add the following statement to the spec (as a Note to either to checkpoint 6.1 or 6.2): "Developers should not implement an optional feature of a specification if that feature may pose accessibility problems and if the user cannot turn off the feature in the user agent." 
Responses in JRG: 
JRG: I agree 
JRG: Our use of recognize seems to also mean "interpret", if that helps with a definition 
JRG: Yes I think this would help clarify the HTML 4 case. 
In the case of scripting though the user agent will also know that the script is requesting a new document using the "location" property (NN) or method with 3 types of methods (IE) of the windows object. 
In this case the user agent does not know if this function was called as part of an explicit user request or if the script is generating the page change without explicit user notification. 
The script writer currrently would need to design there code for only explicit user activiation. 
JRG: Seems reasonable to me. 
JRG: The user agent will typically issue a dialog box warning or render a web page if access to the resource is not available. 
This would seem to suffice for me. 
JRG: I I think horizontal is very important for people with visual impairements. 
Many times they increase font size and information formatted in table columns disappears off the right hand side of the screen. 
Many users don't know the information is there and the horizontal scroll bars are important to give people information. 
JRG: It seems reasonable to me, but what test do we give developers to know if it will affect accessibility? 
Is there an example of an optional feature?

Snipped anything where I would have said "me too", and scattered comments into the rest.

CMN There are two issues here - submitting information that hasn't been completed, which was the original motivation for this checkpoint, and being shifted without knowing why, which is covered by requirements such as turning off auto-refresh, although the various possible javascript techniques for doing it cvould be incorporated into the techniques document, along the lines of Jon's suggestion.

CMN no clues on this one.

CMN definitely agree. 
For text a better option is often to be able to wrap, but people do nasty layout tricks that can work out messy with that, and you can't wrap an image anyway, as a rule.

CMN A feature which determines whether it is possible to do, or to "view" something which is required or suggested by WCAG. 
(This is another case where relative priorities would be helpful, if you can bear the extra complexity).
