<s> MathML and Accessibility So right now, the recommendation to use MathML for accessibility is just ... wishful thinking.  </s>
<s> I'm using it because it's the only sensible was to put math on the web.  </s>
<s> But accessible?  </s>
<s> Not for the foreseeable future.  </s>
<s> And you ain't seen nothin' yet till you've looked at a MathML page in Lynx.  </s>
<s> Cf. http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000193.html .  </s>
<s> This guy wrote, in July, alt="" may pass the W3C Validator , but is still isn?t accessible.  </s>
<s> and I doubt there are any screen readers out there that grock MathML I have no doubt that he is a smart guy, but he seems to be less than an expert on accessibility.  </s>
<s> True, lynx doesn't handle MathML.  </s>
<s> Nor is it useful for chemistry or music.  </s>
<s> It handles documents of the kind that can be sensibly encoded in HTML.  </s>
<s> It doesn't even handle XML in general, which is readily used for specific document types (invoices, particular types of company document, etc), let alone something as specialised as mathematics.  </s>
<s> Actually, it seems he is right that MathML is the sensible way to encode maths, and there are several ways of accessing it through speech.  </s>
<s> One is to use an XSLT to transform it to TeX/LaTeX and use Aster to read that.  </s>
<s> Another is to use IBM's Techexplorer (a browser designed specifically for this type of content), which can provide speech output through ViaVoice.  </s>
<s> Another is to use a math-processing program such as mathematica with a screen reader.  </s>
<s> The real difficulty turns out to be in producing braille.  </s>
<s> There are a number of people doing this around the world, wrestling with the differences in braille usage (because originally standardisation didn't seem that important), and making steady progress.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, MathML lends itself to production of diagrams, etc. using common math processing tools - learning to recognise a curve that makes sense for an equation no longer involves the hours of hand-plotting points that I had to do as a kid, in much the same way as understanding logarithmic tables is no longer necessary for many real-world applications, since calculators are cheaper and more accurate.  </s>
<s> Specific to accessibility of mathematics for blind people, a new list has just been created - there is an announcement to the blinux list which is archived at and the home page for the group itself is at cheers Chaals On Wednesday, Aug 13, 2003, at 06:38 Australia/Canberra, Joe Clark  </s>

<s> We've been trying to tackle TeX, MathML, PDFs and accessibility here at the OpenCourseWare project.  </s>
<s> We're about to launch 500 courses at the end of Sept. and have about 86,762 PDF files - the majority of which were created from a TeX source.  </s>
<s> Based on our work with MIT's ATIC lab (http://web.mit.edu/atic), it's been more accessible to convert these TeX file to PDF than HTML as the latter produces hundreds of graphic files for each mathematical or scientific equation.  </s>
<s> We've even started a campus-wide committee to look at the accessibility of PDFs.  </s>
<s> I'm hoping that Acrobat 6.0's XML functionality will allow us to embed MathML converted from the TeX files into PDFs (since if we did MathML in HTML we'd still have to have a graphical representation to work on older browsers).  </s>
<s> My main concern is retaining the contextuality of the information and secondly, allowing for screenreaders to read the math.  </s>
<s> I've also taken a look at MathSpeak (http://www.mathspeak.org/) at the suggestion of the ATIC lab.  </s>
<s> Lloyd posted something about it in early June.  </s>
<s> It's built-in to LiveMath's MathEQ 4.0 which we received a trial copy of.  </s>
<s> MathSpeak takes a mathematical equation you create in MathEQ and creates a verbal textual equivalent.  </s>
<s> For example, the graphic at this location: Produces a ALT tag text that reads: integral from lower limit negative 1 to upper limit 1 of integrand x to the 2 power plus 3x plus 2 dx This is excellent, in my opinion and really goes to make graphical versions of mathematical and scientific equations accessible.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, MathEQ is incredibly non-intuitive and if you're not a math person, it is impossible to recreate equations visually and would be faster to type out the text oneself.  </s>
<s> As far as we could tell, it did not come with any sort of instructions and its claims of producing "special HTML tags" were not verifiable.  </s>
<s> Now -if I could give our math &amp; engineering professors a set of guidelines for accessible source documents (i.e. TeX) that produce clean and accessible XHTML + MathML...I'd be a happy camper.  </s>
