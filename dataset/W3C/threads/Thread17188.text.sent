Or an ALT attribute (although that would be alot of text).

WiseGuysOnly 1. 'Accessible,' doesn't mean what we think. 
In the first instance, one has to realize that when this page talks 'accessible' it is using the word in its common sense - "readily grasped" and not the code meaning we use the term for - "usable by people with disabilities". 
The good news is that anyone knew the second meaning well enough to submit this page to the gripe collection. 
As an advocacy community we should get used to the fact that we will never own the first meaning of the term 'accessible' and that we will always have to explain our terms before we use it by itself to mean "by people with disabilities." 
Forever. 
Get over it. 
2. This page is inaccessible by any definition. 
The irony here is that even taking Zylex on their own terms, they don't get it. 
Zylex are hoisted on their own petard. 
What they do belies what they say. 
Immediately on load, without reading anything or navigating anywhere. 
You get the -NOT before the claim. 
They talk the talk of effective web design, but even as they talk they can't seem to get it together to put their own message across. 
The main title of this page, "Accessible Web Design," is quite illegible because of the 'arty' use of the white text in a funky font overlaid on a strongly busy image. 
Theory 1, Practice 0. Zylex are all briefed up on the buzzwords: "recognition vs. recall" etc; but they don't understand the nuts and bolts of usable graphic communication. 
The slanty question marks on "Who are we?" and "Why Zylex?" jar the eye and break the flow of the composition. 
Even the central metaphor, the symbolic value of the grapes in the background, is broken. 
Accessible means readily grasped, but the view of the grapes is too close to the subject for one to feel they are readily grasped. 
It looks as though it would be hard to get your fingers around an individual grape in that mass, and likewise hard to get to a stem where you could pluck off a handfull. 
A cliche association of the concept 'grapes' supports the desired theme; but the actual visual experience presented doesn't. 
If you're not a groupie of conceptual art, you won't get the message. 
The overlay on this image exquisitely portrays the predicament of designers who have Heard the Word but haven't grasped it. 
Wry justice! 
3. But the example is tired, not worth special mention. 
I wouldn't take this submission for the sucker of the day. 
This level of incompetence is, in today's world, commonplace. 
YetAnother SameOld. 
It is just not exceptional enough to be an eye opener for your visitors, or unexpected enough to bring those who spend a moment with it back to your "of the day" service for another hit later. 
Their "optimize the user experience" accessibility is on a par with their "for people with disabilities" accessibility -- missing when needed. 
But not in any entertaining way. 
Their dismal achievement level is merely dismal, not attaining the poignancy to make it cathartic. 
So pass on this one. 
Al Just for fun, I tried to validate theri page at the W3 validator, and received the following: Fatal Error: No DOCTYPE specified! 
I could not parse this document, because it does not include a DOCTYPE Declaration. 
A DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for most current markup languages and without such a declaration it is impossible to validate this document. 
I guess that it might not be accessible to alternative devices either... Al suggests (below) that accessible means "usable by people with disabilities". 
With all due respect, if we continue to try and sell that message we will never get ahead. 
Might I suggest instead that we say: "Accessible to any user regardless of what type of technology they may be using. 
This includes, but is not limited to, cell phones, PDAs, and various types of adaptive technology used by some people with disabilities." 
It comes down to ROI, not humanity I'm afraid. 
One of the best "tricks" I use is to employ a cell phone emulator to review a client site... the suits get that way more than they get JAWs.

Vincent Flanders Order "Son of Web Pages That Suck" at nders/ The problem with the general definition is it also includes people with limited hardware because they live in countries where there is little disposal income to attract the web site authors++. 
For that reason, I think, there is actually a preference to narrow the definition of accessibility to the disabled, because web site operators can see that as something that could happen to them or their families. 
++ or even low income people in high income countries. 
Further irony - I can't get my (4.0.1) copy of Bobby to even find the page!

Kadina, South Australia | * Tivis Project * Community Connect * Well a problem with proselytising accessibility, a benefit with accessible sites. 
Of course anyone who's looked at global economics knows that milking such countries for all you can get is a very profitable move - though promoting that viewpoint to management is kinda dancing with the devil. 
Hello Hy, They didn't even use ALT on their links. 
grin Is not it tragic (or to laught at) that such an "accessibile" web design company-page needs an alternate text-only version as an alt will be ways too long to render it correctly in most devices and a longdesc or d-link nearly will contain the whole page text? 
To render the text-only version correctly in all the browsers, the code also needs a doc type .
