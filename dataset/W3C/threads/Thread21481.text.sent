Given the success of the table describing mU and role I was wondering whether we can clarify issue 250 by adding another one listing the roles in a similar manner (see attached) in section 2.2 where we have the list of role definitions [1]. 
This may make it easier to see than the current bullet list. 
Btw, in table 2 "SOAP Nodes Forwarding behaviour", we should refer to the names "next", "ultimateReceiver", and "none" as *short-names* as we in section 2.2 defined the role *name* as a URI. 
Comments?

Sounds good. 
Done. 
Sounds good as well. 
Done. 
Wow! Henrik the current bullet list. 
Overall I like it. 
One editorial comment, though I think this is on text that traces to earlier versions. 
Your table has: "To establish itself as an ultimate SOAP receiver a SOAP node MUST act in this role. 
" I've never liked that, as I think you establish yourself as an ultimate receiver by agreeing to undertake all the requirements of the specification for an ultimate reciever, including not relaying the message. 
Since we've quite clearly established elsewhere what an ultimate receiver is, I propose: "The ultimate receiver MUST act in this role. 
" Sound right?

We should also delete the sentence in the "next" role "and MAY additionally assume zero or more other SOAP roles." 
As this applies to all of them and people may think it does not when it only is called out for "next". 
Henrik Frystyk Nielsen I've just *done* both.
