<s> Wendy, After reading the description, I think I could fit the role well, but since my interest is primarily with the "cognitive, learning, and intellectual" disabilities, I feel I may be left out of discussions which should include these groups but which may not be originally apparent to those who raise issues.  </s>
<s> I'm catching up with about a week's worth of posts to this list this evening, and responded to one about a prototype (from Scott) in which I raise what I hope are succinct issues about the range of variations in disabilities which would lead to omissions in considerations if a "prototype" type of approach to guidelines is ever adopted.  </s>

<s> A reviewer role is extremely helpful.  </s>
<s> Although we did not formalise it in AU  </s>
<s> we had seveeral people who had agreed to act in such a way, and the UA group  </s>
<s> also put considerable effort into securing commitments to review from people  </s>
<s> who were not able to be full participants in the working group.  </s>
<s> It would seem that if someone's interest is in Authoring Tools or User Agents  </s>
<s> perhaps they should be encouraged to join the relevant working groups (or act  </s>
<s> as reviewers for those groups).  </s>
<s> I think that there is a need for the different groups to review each others' work (in particular AU has a very heavy dependency on WCAG) but I think that review needs to be done by members  </s>
<s> of the actual working group.  </s>

<s> I am not clear if I support formalising the role or not.  </s>
<s> Probably on balance I do - at least avertising that this is a useful way someone can contribute to the group without being a full participant is a good idea.  </s>
<s> As an alternative to deleting user agent and authoring tools as possible areas of interest it may be worth adding a note to the end of the list pointing out that for those areas there are other groups that can provide more direct engagement in the interest area, and that they also welcome reviewers (but we would need to discuss this across the relevant groups)  </s>
