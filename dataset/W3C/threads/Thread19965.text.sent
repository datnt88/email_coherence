The most annoying thing about Amaya 2.4 (haven't d/led 2.5 so it might have gone away) is that you can't produce a @! 
(Right Alt+2) On RH 6.0, Swedish keyboard layout. 
Needless to say it works in all other apps I'm using.

I'll check that Irene. 
That is the same problem I described in a earlier posting (Wed, 08 Mar). 
But @ (on a german keyboard "Alt Gr" + "2") is not the only character I cannot produce. 
Version 2.5 has the same problem. 
Any help would be highly appreciated!

In the current version Amaya doesn't take setting of xmodmap into account Could you check that this line into amaya.keyboard 
allows you to insert Alt key 2:TtcInsertChar("\100") For more information see Help- Configuring Amaya Hope that helps Irene.
