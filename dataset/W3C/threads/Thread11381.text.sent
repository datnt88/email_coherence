From: bosak@atlantic-83.Eng.Sun.COM (Jon Bosak) |  Yes, allow PUBLIC: Kimber, DeRose, Sperberg-McQueen, Maler, Hollander |  No, no PUBLIC ID: Paoli, Sharpe, Magliery, Clark, Bray, Bosak | |  So in this draft, no public IDs. 
It should be voted that *every person* |  on the No side would change their vote to Yes if there was an agreed-on |  resolution mechanism for PUBLIC identifiers. 
It should be noted that all the NO votes were "no, not ready for this particular draft, we need to agree on a resolution mechanism before we can include public identifiers." 
There is general agreement that XML will have public identifiers, but there has to be general agreement on a resolution mechanism before it shows up in the spec. 
XML 1.0 has a long way to go before it achieves "recommended" status. 
This feature just isn't cooked yet. 
Here is a quick rewrite of the XML catalog proposal with the extras removed. 
I don't know if this helps cook it or just adds too many chefs, but it provides something concrete and as simple as seems possible. 
paul --------- Section 4.2.2 "External Entities" in Working Draft 14-Nov-96 [68] [[unchanged]] [69'] ExternalID := 'PUBLIC' S PublicID ( S SystemLiteral )? 
| 'SYSTEM' (S SystemLiteral)? 
[70] [[unchanged]] [70a] PublicID := RestrictedLiteral [70b] RestrictedLiteral := '"' RestrictedLiteralChars '"' | "'" RestrictedLiteralChars "'" [70c] RestrictedLiteralChars := (Letter | Digit | S | SpecialChars)* [70d] SpecialChars := ['()+,-./:=?] [71] [[unchanged]] The PublicID is called the entity's public identifier. 
The SystemLiteral that may follow the entity's public identifier and the SystemLiteral that may follow the SYSTEM keyword are called the entity's system identifier. 
When an XML processor encounters an external entity defined by a public identifier, the processor determines the associated system identifier from a supplemental XML catalog (see 4.3.1). 
If the XML processor cannot successfully use or resolve the public identifer, and a system identifier follows the public identifier, the XML processor shall behave as if the system identifier was the only identifier supplied. 
If the XML processor cannot successfully use or resolve the public identifier, and a system identifier does not follow the public identifier, the XML processor shall behave as if a system identifier could not be resolved. 
The system identifier is a URL, which may be used to retrieve... [[continues as in XML WD 1.0]]. 
4.3.1 
XML Catalog Specification [C1] XMLCatalog := S? ( ( catComment | catEntry ) ( S ( catComment | catEntry ) )* )? 
[C2] catComment := '--*' ... '*--' [C3] catEntry := catPublic | catOtherEntry [C4] catPublic := 'PUBLIC' S PublicID S SystemLiteral [C8] catOtherEntry := catKeyword ( S SystemLiteral )+ [C9] catKeyword := [^S"'./\  
] [^S./\  ]* An example of several catalog entries follows: PUBLIC "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN" "iso-lat1.gml" 
PUBLIC "-//ACME//DTD Report//EN" "http://www.acme.com/dtds/report.dtd" 
The PublicID is the public identifier (see also production 70a) of the entity or notation. 
A catPublic entry maps a PublicID into a SystemLiteral used to locate the entity (see production 70). 
Because public identifiers are used as "match indices" into catalogs, an "interpreted" value is defined that is used in the matching process. 
The public identifiers from the ExternalID production as well as the PublicID from the catPublic catalog entries undergo this interpretation prior to any matching being attempted. 
This interpretation consists of removing the surrounding quotes, deleting all leading and trailing white space, and replacing all embedded sequences of occurrences of white space (see production 1) with a single space (#x0020) character. 
When the interpreted value of the public identifier of an ExternalID (production 69) exactly matches the interpreted value of the public identifier of a PUBLIC type catalog entry, that catalog entry associates its right hand side (SystemLiteral) with the given entity or notation. 
The first such exact match terminates the catalog lookup process. 
All catOtherEntry entries have no effect prescribed by this XML specification, though individual implementations may recognize and operate on any or all of them. 
Let me say it another way. 
User agents should not be required to support catalogues *or any other mechanism specified by XML* to resolve public identifiers. 
There should be *no default assumed* by publishers. 
That's hard to swallow, and most of this group is choking on it; ask yourselves whether you need a specified default mechanism to find a copy of Moby Dick; ask yourselves whether, had Melville's publisher specified a default mechanism (e.g., writing to the publisher's address), you should have to follow it today.

This should be at the discretion of the user agent. 
Default means "at the discretion of the user agent, as long as they support at least *this*." 
There is no dichtomy between default and freedom. 
(And by resolution I mean what Peter does, figuring out the indirection and obtaining the item.) One can say that a catalogue is the publisher's advice on how to resolve his PIs, but the client should not be restricted to that method. 
If we meant that the client should be restricted, we would not use the word "default", we would use the word "exclusive." 
Paul Prescod When I ask myself the question, this is the answer: In the example cited ("Moby Dick"), there is a well-proven system in place, and both publishers and readers/buyers do indeed "follow it today." 
It has two essential components: they are called the "title page" and the "bibliography". 
The edition of Moby Dick contains a "title page", which contains both an ISBN number (a unique identifier for the edition) and the bibliographical information neecssary to uniquely identify the work -- title, author, publisher, editor, date of publication, place of publication, etc. 
The title page is used by authors/editors to construct a bibliography, a mechanism users can employ to find "Moby Dick" at the library, the bookstore, or the online bookseller.
