In today's techniques teleconference we discussed the structure of Gateway Techniques and how they relate to the rest of the technology-specific techniques. 
The problems and benefits of particular approaches related to specific use cases, or goals people have from the techniques and ways people achieve those goals in our documents. 
It seemed that we did not have a complete of use cases on the table, which we need to complete this discussion. 
Everyone on the call agreed to come up with possible use cases during this week, and email them to the list so we can review them. 
We will continue the discussion in the face to face meeting next week. 
So people on the list know what's going on when these messages appear we thought it best to explain what we're doing. 
If members of the list who weren't on the call would like to contribute use cases, that would be welcomed as well. 
I suggest all use case proposals be posted as a reply to this message so we can keep the thread toegher. 
I will also ask the IG list for thoughts. 
Michael Michael Cooper Accessibility Project Manager Watchfire 1 Hines Rd Kanata, ON K2K 3C7 Canada Michael, To be certain that I understand what's wanted-- please clarify what's meant by "use cases" here: do you meanthings for which tables might be used, e.g., "A bus schedule is presented with intersections listed across row 1 and timepoints shown in the columns below"? 
Thanks.

Michael Michael Cooper Accessibility Project Manager Watchfire 1 Hines Rd Kanata, ON K2K 3C7 Canada Sorry I wasn't clear. 
I mean ways people will go through the techniques documents, the kind of information they're looking for. 
A person creating a bus schedule will need to know about tabular markup (probably in the Gateway Techniques) and the specific HTML codes to use or avoid (in the HTML Techniques). 
There are different possible ways they may look for this information, and we need to make it easy for them to find it regardless of the route they take. 
I provided a little more explanation in my post to the IG list [the archive seems to be down so no URL].

*Cough*. 
Sounds great in a screen reader.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ Hello, While trying to think about the used case scenario, I was browsing through WCAG 2 and the Gateway doc and again the same thought came up: What is in the Gateway doc is a lucid explanation of every checkpoint. 
For instance if I do not understand what is meant by checkpoint 1.3 that reads, "Both [information/substance] and structure are separable from presentation.", 
I would turn to the explanation in the Gateway doc. 
This piece of explanation or those following any other checkpoint in the Gateway doc does not state any specific technique for accomplishing the checkpoints. 
These will be in the technology-specific docs. 
So I do not really understand why the content following every checkpoint contained in the Gateway doc cannot be in the main WCAG 2 doc. 
I brought this up yesterday during the tel-conference and it was explained to me that WCAG 2.0 is a normative doc while the gateway is not. 
The WCAG 2 contains definitions, benefits and examples (all non-normative) for each checkpoint so why not the explanation for every checkpoint? 
I think the WCAG 2 is the best place for these explanatory paragraphs. 
A user does not have to link to another doc and read that. 
If he/she does not want the explanation he can just skip it and jump to the success criteria or whatever. 
It will save a lot of time and effort in writing and vetting up all other sections necessary(abstract, status of doc, TOC, etc) to make the doc complete. 
Well, the required success criteria can be taken up in the Gateway doc grouped by checkpoint but without the present explanatory content. 
The techniques can be linked for every success criteria.

* Look up http://www.deque.com 
* Please also note that at least one other person feels that some explanation should follow checkpoints in WCAG 2 doc. 
Checkpoint 1.1 examples: Since this checkpoint is both basic and vastly complex, some definitive examples of when and where and how to use text equivalents should be here, not just relegated to the techniques." 
This is from bug report # 404 Sailesh Panchang Senior Accessibility Engineer Deque Systems Inc 11180 Sunrise Valley Drive, 4th Floor, Reston VA 20191 E-mail: sailesh.panchang@deque.com 
* Look up http://www.deque.com 
* Likely approaches to use Gateway and Techniques doc for WCAG 2.0 1. Developers wanting to implement WCAG 2.0 or those testing for compliance In all likelihood they will consider core checkpoints first and then regard extended checkpoints They should be able to conveniently identify Gateway and Techniques doc content relating to core checkpoints and extended checkpoints 2. Developers / managers debating on development methodologies might want to check out techniques offered by one technology versus another technology for complying with specific required success criteria / checkpoint 3. An individual who has decided to follow a particular technology path will want to focus on the specific techniques suggested for various checkpoints in the relevant technology doc and not concern himself with other technology docs. 
4. Those considering switching from one technology to another 5. 
Those who are pursuing WCAG 1.0 and are now checking how WCAG 2 will affect them. 
They mmight use the checkpoint matching document, WCAG 1 and WCAG 2 for comparison Any of the above users will want to navigate from the WCAG doc or the techniques doc to the explanatory content for a checkpoint to gain a clearer understanding of the issues involved. 
6. 
Those concerned mainly with policy level issues will not delve into specific technologies. 
They will keep switching back and forth between the checkpoint and details in the WCAG doc and the explanation in the Gateway doc. 
Example: - Individuals responsible for framing Web access standards / policies for their organization / state - researchers - for preparing edu and outreach related presentations Trust this is helpful Sailesh Sorry I wasn't clear.
