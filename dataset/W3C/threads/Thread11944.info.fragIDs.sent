<s> Hi all, A new draft guideline has been placed on the the site: Please send any comments, revisions, etc. to the list.  </s>
<s> Jan Richards ATRC jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
<s> Authoring Tool Guidelines WG: Good to see the new AU guidelines working draft.  </s>
<s> I encourage other AUWG members to take the time to go through this draft and comment to the list as soon as possible, as well as to discuss the draft on the phone meeting that Jutta has arranged for the 13th.  </s>
<s> We need to move this forward, and need your help to do so.  </s>
<s> My comments follow.  </s>
<s> Regards, Judy Generally: 1.  </s>
<s> The document outline is a great improvement over previous drafts and more comprehensively addresses the issues.  </s>
<s> 2. The format is inconsistent from item to item in the document: there is a mix of guideline, rationale, and technique for each item, sometimes in different order.  </s>
<s> To be consistent with the evolving WAI guidelines format, use: broad categories; and within those, simple guideline statements, followed by a brief rationale, followed by available techniques to implement that guideline; leaving technical details of implementation to appendices.  </s>
<s> The best example of this format presently is the WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Draft at http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH.  </s>
<s> Examples of problem areas in the current AU draft, where there is not a clear guideline/rationale/technique statement: 3.B.4 rationale is too long, and there is no technique or example 3.C.1 there's a guideline, a restatement of that guideline, some rationale, then more guideline 3.C.2 a definition (which should be covered in the definition section up front), more definition, then two very different guidelines, the second of which is a critical issue that should not be buried.  </s>
<s> 3. The guidelines themselves should be as directly stated as possible.  </s>
<s> Use the active voice (actually, the imperative -- start each guideline with a verb), which has more impact, and is easier to understand and translate than passive voice (see 3.C.4).  </s>
<s> For instance, replace:  </s>
<s> "3.A.3 All inaccessible markup must be exposed" with: "3.A.# Expose all inaccessible markup" and replace: "3.B.3 Help examples should include accessibility solutions" with: "3.B.3 Include help examples in accessibility solutions" 4. Keep the tone objective.  </s>
<s> There are some sections that sound like opinion rather than guidelines (3.A.5 "If proper integration is neglected... authors will be likely to treat the recommendations with equally little regard" and some sections that sound negative (3.A.5 "When a new feature is added... in a careless way" or special note at 3.C "boring, repetitive...").  </s>
<s> It's possible to convey the same information in a more objective way: "Integration of an accessibility-related feature into the pre-existing user interface increases user acceptance." 5. Eliminate use of "Special Notes": if these are in fact valid and necessary pieces of information, just make them part of the introduction to a section.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> Several of the guideline items seem to actually be several items rolled into one.  </s>
<s> For instance, 3.A.4 includes recommendations for accessibility-checking strategies in site management tools, alerts for alt text in image editors, and encouragement for descriptive text in video editors.  </s>
<s> 7. Use "Web" instead of "WWW" to be consistent with W3C style.  </s>
<s> 8. I recommend "Universal Design" over "Universal Access" since the latter occassionally gets confused with the "Universal Service" concept in telecommunications.  </s>
<s> But perhaps this issue has already been discussed by the WG. 9. The title of the core of the document seems odd.  </s>
<s> Why is it called "Guidelines for Accessible Document Production" (sounds like the page author guidelines) rather than "Guidelines for Development of Web Authoring Tools that Support Accessibility" or something like that?  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> For the note at the beginning of the document, wouldn't it be clearer to say "This document provides guidance on the development of Web authoring tools which produce accessible Web pages, consistent with the 'WAI Page Authoring Guidelines.'" 11.  </s>
<s> At 2.1, Markup Authoring, Conversion and Generation Tools, I don't understand the last paragraph which states that these guidelines don't address generation tools, but that the guidelines apply to generation tools.  </s>
<s> I recommend that these guidelines directly address generation tools as well as the other two.  </s>
<s> In addition, why not include site management tools, image-editors, video-editors, and multimedia authoring tools to the extent that those tools have accessibility-related issues for development of Web content?  </s>
<s> You already cover many of the issues in the guidelines you've written to date.  </s>
<s> 12.  </s>
<s> At 2.5, add "or structured tree view" to the examples of different views (such as the Amaya authoring capabilities support) 13.  </s>
<s> At 2.7, is it necessary to define these two items?  </s>
<s> 14.  </s>
<s> At 3.A.1, this isn't just related to the page author guidelines; I think you also need to include a list of all the accessibility-related features in HTML4, CSS2, SMIL, etc. since the page author guidelines includes multiple and sometimes alternate techniques for guideline items.  </s>
<s> These can be pulled out of the /WAI/References/html4-access &amp; /css2-access, or Ian may be working on a listing.  </s>
<s> If we don't list the items to implement, we shouldn't expect the engineers who're developing code to take more trouble than we have to find the items &amp; make sure they understand the purpose &amp; issues involved in implementing them.  </s>
<s> 15.  </s>
<s> At 3.A.2, what's the difference between the first and the third bullet?  </s>
<s> 16.  </s>
<s> At 3.A.4, what is a "serious, effective, and uniform manner"?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that an authoring tool engineer would find that clear or helpful.  </s>
<s> 17.  </s>
<s> At 3.B.2, at "the justifications should also address", for the first item (aging) please add "hearing and cognitive" (actually, statistically in that age bracket I believe new hearing loss is greater than the others); and for the second item please add cognitive.  </s>
<s> (and what's the WAI Justifications Document? the business-case-to-be?) 18. 3.B.4 great!  </s>
<s> 19. 3.C.1 2nd P is scrambled; and this one needs an example or technique pointer.  </s>
<s> 20. 3.C.3 Critical point, but needs to be more clearly stated.  </s>
<s> 21. References: CSS1 - isn't there a non-date specific URL for this?  </s>
<s> should be.  </s>

<s> Hello, Judy sent a lot of great comments about the latest draft, and I'd like to add a few.  </s>
<s> I agree, although some of the wording in the current guidelines is probably mine.  </s>
<s> If the imperative is used, the guidelines must clearly indicate who is the understood "you".  </s>
<s> Thus, the table of contents would become something like: 3.A Integration of accessibility awareness 3.A.1 Support all accessiblity features of relevant languages (HTML, CSS, SMIL, XML, etc.) 3.A.2 Emphasize accessible authoring practices 3.A.3 Expose all inaccessible markup 3.A.4 Promote accessibility awareness in tool suites 3.A.5 Integrate accessibility features naturally 3.A.6 Allow users to configure levels of accessibility awareness 3.B Provision of accessibility information 3.B.1 Provide context-sensitive accessibility help to authors 3.B.2 Provide rationales that stress Universal Design 3.B.3 Offer practical and accessible solutions in examples 3.B.4 Package multimedia files with pre-written descriptions 3.C Accessibility Task automation 3.C.1 Allow the user to check for and correct accessibility problems automatically 3.C.2 Ensure that all markup inserted through the user interface is accessible 3.C.3 Ensure that conversion tools produce accessible markup 3.C.4 Avoid removing or modifying existing structure or descriptive content 3.C.5 Offer dedicated accessibility tools One problem is that not all of these entries "strike me" (for example 3.C.5 and 3.B.3).  </s>
<s> I recommend narrowing the scope of these guidelines slightly so that a stronger message is apparent.  </s>
<s> I have some questions about 3.C.4.  </s>
<s> There are two phenomena we can describe here: (1) the structure and content of a document, and (2) the way the characters appear in a file.  </s>
<s> As an author, I am always frustrated by authoring tools that modify (2).  </s>
<s> Authoring tools that reformat files wreak havoc, for example, on archiving tools such as CVS.  </s>
<s> This phenomenon, however, is probably not the focus of this guideline.  </s>
<s> The guideline states that authoring tools should not modify existing structure.  </s>
<s> I think instead that we should say: - Authoring tools must be allowed to change a document to make it more accessible.  </s>
<s> (They should be able to read inaccessible markup and write accessible markup).  </s>
<s> - Authoring tools must allow users to know when such changes are made.  </s>
<s> I could easily imaging working with a trustworthy tool with the option "Tell me when you've modified the document" turned off.  </s>
<s> Although in general I don't appreciate software doing things behind my back, in this case, I would rather not be interrupted is the only changes being made are to promote accessibility.  </s>
<s> Users should be able to choose to be notified or not.  </s>
<s> In general, I recommend that the guidelines allow users to turn on and off certain features.  </s>
<s> For example, 3.A.3 already reads "All authoring tools for a specific markup languagemust be capable of searching [for] and flagging inaccessible markup...Authors must be made aware of the existing and location of inaccessible markup as soon as possible..." I think users need to be able to configure their tools so that they may be informed at different times.  </s>
<s> For instance, I don't like Word to show me spelling and grammar errors by underlining text (it's distracting, it hurts performance etc.).  </s>
<s> I would rather check for spelling errors in a different phase of editing (in batch mode, actually).  </s>
<s> In short, authoring tools must provide certain functionalities, but allow the user to configure the tool according to taste (this could/should actually be a guideline related to the user interface of tools).  </s>
<s> I'll have more comments soon, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
