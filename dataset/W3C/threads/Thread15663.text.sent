Maybe I'm looking at HTML from a more practical distance. 
What I would prefer for a descriptive language as HTML is: - have elements for certain things a designer needs - have equivalent attributes in all elements each with its specific use and of course always the same attribute for the same use. 
In fact this means ALL elements have ALL attributes with the same use (relevant or not). 
It is typical for a historically grown language to have different attribute in each element each coverring some or some other target. 
I would be happy if the HTML 4.0 would avoid this problem by simply standardizing atrribute defniitons and give them to ALL elements (where useful). 
I don't think adding a TOOL-TIP attributes will help in the long run, since I think they're too close to each other, and content providers will either use it or use ALT, but not both, and in the end, it will become a replacement for ALT, under a new name. 
It is funny how the same argument can bring completely opposite conclusions: ALT and TOOL_TIP will cover different needs so they can exist both and next to each other and hold differend texts. 
The only reason ALT is miss-used (see Al's message) is that there is no nice attribute for the "tool tip" so therefore they took ALT; thanks to the big browser manufacturers ! 
Why e.g. is there no ALT in the OBJECT element? 
We do need it there to don't we? Best regards, Jaap Message from: Jaap van Lelieveld The Netherlands Chairman of EBU commission on Technical Devices and Services E-mail: Jaap.van.Lelieveld@inter.nl.net USING: YARN V0.92 as an offline reader, and UQWK / OLMENU under UNIX for mail and news transfer Dave answered this one yesterday: The OBJECT element doesn't include an alt attribute since the content of the OBJECT element is used as the fallback. 
This allows for rich text descriptions to be given in place including regular HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists and hypertext links. 
The title attribute can be used for a one-liner description of the OBJECT and would normally be used on gui's as a tooltip for the object. 
to follow up on what jaap van lelieveld said: I think that Jaap has sounded what is going to be one of our long-running themes. 
It _is_ one of our themes. 
It would be better if HTML were posessed of a smaller vocabulary of more general-purpose terms. 
I believe that this does make a difference in our ability to populate the Web with universal documents that make sense in different browse modes. 
It won't be solved overnight. 
Some of the reasons why the OPTION proposal talks about an OPTGROUP element and not a broader GROUP element have to do with accidents of SGML structure and some of it has to do with more fundamental efficiency reasons why SGML was built that way. 
Another reason it won't happen instantly is that merging different communities' visions to come up with a common vocabulary of the concepts that need to be reflected in the HTML terms is a slow process. 
It's easy and quick to go our own ways. 
Hearing one another is another matter.
