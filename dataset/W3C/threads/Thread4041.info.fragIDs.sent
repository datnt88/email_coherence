<s> The most frustrating in writing such comments is that what a user finds useful and logical is considered not to have a strong use-case.  </s>
<s> On the other side the distinct-values function returning its result in implementation defined order is really of little use.  </s>
<s> What is the use of a function, if you cannot give even one example of its application and the result it must return?  </s>
<s> At the moment, the best that may be provided is a *possible result*.  </s>
<s> The existence of such function definitions, which do not define the result of the function in a precise manner (e.g. "... is implementation defined") is not a good feature of this document.  </s>
<s> Such behaviour also does not answer any real need, but as was explained by Michael Rys in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0206.html this definition of the function is due only to efficiency considerations.  </s>
<s> If this could help, there is a function "distinct" defined in the "sets" module of EXSLT and implemented for the most popular XSLT 1.0 processors.  </s>
<s> Its definition can be found at http://exslt.org/set/functions/distinct/index.html and is as follows: "node-set set:distinct(node-set) The set:distinct function returns a subset of the nodes contained in the node-set NS passed as the first argument.  </s>
<s> Specifically, it selects a node N if there is no node in NS that has the same string value as N, and that precedes N in document order.  </s>
<s> " I still hope that a useful distinct-values function can be specified in a next version of this document.  </s>
