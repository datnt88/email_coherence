William, For example courseware tool demos look at: For an example WebCT course look at: both the unmoderated and moderated course section. 
Jutta I've logged in to a course but I want to find a demo of a whiteboard without ferreting it out. 
Point me, please! 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Sorry William, since we are concerned with access on the SNOW site we have not included the Whiteboard in our tool sets when using WebCT. 
To see the white board you'll have to go to Jutta
