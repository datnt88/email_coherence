has any drafting been done of a fuller replacement for 19.9 than what's in id 8? I circulated a draft of about half of the requirements for section 13 (caching) about 2 or 3 months ago, as a "test of concept". 
It got reasonably positive response. 
However, we decided not to include a full listing in draft -08, because (1) we felt that getting the spec right was more important than writing the requirements summary, and we could not finish both before the July 30 cutoff date. 
(2) The spec was changing enough (relative to RFC2068) that any summary based on RFC2068 would be inaccurate. 
We did not have a procudure in place to ensure that we would be able to know what exactly would have to be updated. 
Of course, those two excuses are (mostly) moot now. 
The real problem is to find a sufficient number of people who have time time to draft portions of the requirements summary. 
I initially went through RFC2068 and divided the effort up among various members of the editorial group, but (as far as I know) none of us (including me) have actually done anything. 
We'd certainly be interested in volunteers, although I think it will be hard to absorb too many different authorial "voices" in this process. 
I think I was also nominated to work on the details of the format. 
One possibility is to put the master copy into a spreadsheet, which gives us some freedom to reformat things (especially because Jim Gettys maintains the master copy of the HTTP/1.1 spec in Word).

I'm hoping that the 'requirements summary' might also be a checklist for the interoperability testing that various WG members claim that they want to do in the next month or so. 
That is, we can determine not only whether or not people implement a feature, but whether it is interoperable with other implementations.
