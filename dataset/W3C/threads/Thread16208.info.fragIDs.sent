Hi; Does anyone know how much text can be entered in the table's SUMMARY attribute? 
My hunch is 255, which I think is the character limit in the ALT attribute. 
Thanks in advance!

In theory I think the limit for the size of an element including all attribute content is 32k (i.e. very big) but in practise I would suggest keeping it shorter. 
Given that the summary attribute isn't available on many of the current generation of browsers, you might also consider using a caption element instead - that is rendered by nearly everything.

The Mozilla browser (and therefor Netscape 6) will display the 'summary' attribute as a tooltip. 
It the table also includes a 'title' attribute, this will be displayed in the same tooltip.

cheers Charles McCN~~ I agree. 
I am not sure how long you can make it, but I have always found it good practice to keep it short and to the point. 
I'd certainly keep it to a small to medium sized sentence.

unquote while i agree that the summary attribute isn't widely supported by quote mainstream unquote user agents, it is supported by several assistive technologies (such as JFW 3.5, which reads the SUMMARY defined for a TABLE when it is present before attempting to articulate the content of the TABLE), as well as several self-voicing browsers the question shouldn't be quote which should i use, SUMMARY or CAPTION? 
unquote, but quote why should i utilize both? 
unquote the answer to why should i utilize the SUMMARY attribute is eloquently provided by the HTML 4.01 Recommendation [reference 1] quote This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille. 
unquote moreover, the HTML 4.01 Recommendation also states, quote The following informative list describes what operations user agents may carry out when rendering a table: * Make the table summary available to the user. 
Authors should provide a summary of a table's content and structure so that people using non-visual user agents may better understand it. 
unquote from which it is clear that: a) the SUMMARY attribute is of great orientational utility to anyone attempting to review web content in a non-graphical slash non-visual slash limited visual modality, such as when using a screen reader and/or a refreshable braille display to access web content, or a mobile or pervasive device, such as a Personal Data Assistant (PDA), which doesn't have enough screen space to display the table in its entirety, but which could (and should) use the SUMMARY attribute to provide users with information about the table or tables contained in a page, thereby providing the user of the mobile device with the option to have the device render the table (in whatever manner it is capable of doing so) or skip it and preserve precious bandwidth and maximize limited processing capacities... using a document's meta-data is far more accurate and intelligent an approach to providing the user with information in a form that is immediately useful to him or her, than is relying upon summarizing software to give the mobile device user a sense of the contents of a web page before the entire page, or parts thereof, are downloaded to the device, which really blurs the line between human and machine readable, but that's a thread from another list... b) the SUMMARY attribute (unlike the CAPTION element) is not intended to be rendered by quote mainstream graphical user agents unquote as regards the CAPTION element, the HTML 4.01 Recommendation states: quote When present, the CAPTION element's text should describe the nature of the table. 
The CAPTION element is only permitted immediately after the TABLE start tag. 
A TABLE element may only contain one CAPTION element. 
Visual user agents allow sighted people to quickly grasp the structure of the table from the headings as well as the caption. 
A consequence of this is that captions will often be inadequate as a summary of the purpose and structure of the table from the perspective of people relying on non-visual user agents. 
Authors should therefore take care to provide additional information summarizing the purpose and structure of the table using the summary attribute of the TABLE element. 
This is especially important for tables without captions. 
Examples below illustrate the use of the summary attribute. 
Visual user agents should avoid clipping any part of the table including the caption, unless a means is provided to access all parts, e.g., by horizontal or vertical scrolling. 
We recommend that the caption text be wrapped to the same width as the table. 
(See also the section on recommended layout algorithms.) unquote in summary, when defining a TABLE, one shouldn't choose between CAPTION and SUMMARY, as they are intended to serve 2 entirely different, yet inter-related, functionalities... authors, should be encouraged to use SUMMARY, as it (1) was explicitly defined as an accessibility aid; and (2) it provides someone who (for whatever reason) cannot see the table (in part or in whole) with a narrative equivalent of what the visually oriented layout that comprises a data table communicates to a user who is capable of perceiving the table in its entirety -- namely the relationships between disparate pieces of data, accorded by their position in relation to one another... even if one is using tables for layout purposes (something i neither condone, nor recommend, nor condemn utterly), one should utilize a summary, as it helps to re-orient the user in the face of an abrupt paradigm shift -- at least, that is, those fortunate enough to have access to adaptive technology or a targeted user agent that is capable of traversing tables according to their structural elements -- for example, if a nested table is used to create a sidebar containing supplemental links or a captioned photo, the function and purpose of the nested table should clearly be indicated to the user via the SUMMARY attribute, as in: SUMMARY="Sidebar Containing Supplemental Links" SUMMARY="Photograph and Caption" so that when focus is serially received by the nested layout table -- as when a page is voiced using JFW or by emacspeak, in conjunction with the w3 browser, which has the decided advantage of supporting the aural styling rules of CSS2 [reference 2], so that the end of the nested table can also be aurally indicated using a client-side stylesheet -- the purpose of that subordinate table is clarified... and, of course, users should always be able to turn off support for SUMMARY if they like, but it does need to be supported, and it does need to be implemented -- as widely and often as possible gregory.

Hello Gregory etal: "...technologies (such as JFW 3.5, which reads the SUMMARY defined for ..." However, this is not done in JFW 3.2 and IE 4. Please do not forget that one should not be assuming everyone has the latest versions of assistive technology, as we should not assume everyone has the latest browsers, graphical or otherwise. 
I also note that Lynx 2.8.1 does not render the summary, but only the caption. 
(again, with JFW 3.2) Still, I agree that use of the summary and caption should not be mutually exclusive. 
I would still like to have the summary since when I view the source, then I will be able to view the summary even though when rendered, I won't hear the summary.
