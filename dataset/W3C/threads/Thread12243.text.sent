aloha, ian! during the afternoon session of the User Agent Working Group meeting in austin on 10 december 1999, you assured me that all of the accessibility attributes and elements contained in HTML4 that are defined for tables are accorded P1 in WCAG... however, WCAG Checkpoints 5.5 and 5.6 (which deal with the summary attribute for TABLE and the abbreviation attribute for TD and TH are only accorded P3... if non-visual access to tabular information (i.e. the ability to search within a table, a nested table, a column or row; the ability to read across rows and down columns; the ability to obtain extended contextual information from a cell in a nested table, etc.) is left to AT interaction with the DOM and relies upon proper usage of TABLE elements and attributes, then _all_ of the semantic slash contextual markup defined for tables in HTML4 needs to be accorded a P1 in WCAG, so that authors provide as much semantic and contextual information as possible when they create a table... this is the only way that a user's adaptive technology will be able to use the DOM to extract semantic information from the TABLE, so as to provide information which will orient the user, thereby making it possible for that user to use whatever navigational mechanisms his or her AT has provided for traversing tables... moreover, both the summary and the abbr attributes are clearly identified in the HTML4 TR as accessibility features the HTML4 definition of the "summary" attribute states quote summary = text [CS] This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille. 
unquote while the HTML4 definition of the "abbr" attribute states: quote abbr = text [CS] This attribute should be used to provide an abbreviated form of the cell's content, and may be rendered by user agents when appropriate in place of the cell's content. 
Abbreviated names should be short since user agents may render them repeatedly. 
For instance, speech synthesizers may render the abbreviated headers relating to a particular cell before rendering that cell's content. 
unquote thus, i would ask that ALL of the structural and contextual slash semantic markup defined for TABLE in HTML4 be accorded a P1 in WCAG, for, as i was minuted as stating at the austin face2face: quote GR: I'm not opposed to using the DOM to walk the tree [in order to perform navigation within tables]. 
The bottom line is authoring practices: misuse of markup. 
Also, lack of implementation of axis/scope/caption/summary. 
If we push everything off to the DOM, it's meaningless unless all the pieces are clearly marked up and defined. 
I'm not asking for [the user agent to repair] poorly marked up tables; however, for proper tables, the information needs to be made available. 
If we say "Get everything from the DOM" we need to ensure that what is needed is in the DOM in the first place.

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC Gregory, I agree table markup items should be higher priority in WCAG. 
But I am not sure what that has to do with the DOM. 
Implementing and exposing the DOM will allow assistive technologies to access table markup information provided by the author. 
If the author didn't include information on table markup, the DOM cannot magically provide it to an assistive technology or for that matter a graphical rendering in a GUI environment. 
I am therefore not sure what you mean by "pushing it off on to the DOM"?

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Gregory, These 2 checkpoints are P3 because providing a summary or header abbreviations make it "easier" to get the info from a table. 
If an author does not provide a summary or header abbreviations, it is not making it "impossible" or "difficult" to access the information in a table. 
UNLESS a summary is so well written that a user would not need to access the table. 
Therefore, I could see upgrading "summary" to P2 for complex tables, p3 for others. 
Headers I still see as "helpful" i.e. they decrease reading time and annoyance (based on the current WCAG use of the "abbr" attribute and not ABBR element. 
ABBR issues are handled in checkpoint 4.2, also a P3). 
Yes, authors should be encouraged to provide as much semantic information as possible. 
The WCAG prioritizes that info based on how well it can help the user access the information, in this case we are refering to the TABLE element. 
Summaries and table header abbreviations do not help access nearly as much as appropriate structure, identifying headers, etc. unless you can prove me otherwise... --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa to boil this down, we ned access to tables and it falls on the ua to provide it in such a way as to allow ats to hook into it. 
ie if you render something graphically, do it accessable and use interoperable standards to make it accesible to a third party application which may be reading from the graphical rendering.

unquote aloha, jon! as i repeatedly asserted at the Austin Face2Face meeting, i do NOT expect the DOM or a user agent to fix a poorly marked up table, which is precisely why i have asked that all of the markup relating to tables in HTML4 that was included in the spec in order to provide structure and contextual slash semantic information about logical relationships between different components of the table, be accorded a P1... the problem is two-fold: first, authors must be encouraged, nudged, and, in some cases, perhaps, even forced, to construct tables that (a) validate, (b) incorporate all of the elements and attributes defined for tables that promote structure; and (c) use all of the elements and attributes defined for tables that convey semantic slash contextual information... (which is why i have cross-posted this to a number of dependent WAI working groups) second, based upon the discussion and feedback from developers received at the UA Face2Face in Austin, it is increasingly apparent that developers are loathe to open the pandora's box that is table navigation... while i still believe that it is the user agent's responsibility to provide at least gross navigational access to tabular information (i.e. provide a list of tables in a document, a go=to listed table functionality, search within a table, traverse column, traverse row, etc.), the way the UAGL is currently (or, rather, in the absence of a post-F2F draft, soon-to-be) constructed, adaptive technologies will have to provide non-graphical users not only with access to the content of tables, but with the ability to search within tables and to navigate within tables... where is the most logical place for the assistive technology to obtain the information necessary to provide the non-visual user with orientation and mobility -- the 2 keys to non-visual navigation? the DOM i am also very concerned that the emphasis on the DOM leaves non-visual users in the lurch -- until the DOM is realized and uniformly implemented, how are assistive technology vendors to provide the navigational and orientational information necessary to provide users with the ability to traverse and query tabularized data to obtain contextual and semantic information, let alone navigate them effectively and efficiently? 
yes, i know that JFW uses the MSIE DOM to provide superb access to content, but does that help the JFW user who works in a single browser intranet, where the single browser is not IE? yes, HPR provides exemplary access to tabular data, but it is utterly dependent upon Netscape... what we are currently drafting in the UA WG, isn't so much quote User Agent Accessibility Guidelines unquote, but quote Rendering Agent Guidelines unquote, as the over-riding emphasis on the DOM will lead to the extinction of the user agent slash browser as we currently know it, leaving the interpretation of document source to parsers and rendering agents... and, while that is a commendable ideal, i and countless others are still left in the lurch, without reliable, robust, cross-platform, and non-browser or AT-specific means of navigating tables or querying them for any contextual slash semantic information they may contain... i would, therefore, also strongly advocate that -- at least in regards tables -- that the UAGL use a bit of if-then logic: "for UAs which implement the DOM" and "for UAs which do not implement the DOM" -- in according priority to table navigation, so that assistive technologies can obtain information about tables, their structure, and the context of each component from UAs that do not (at least not immediately) implement the DOM...... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC JG in response to GR: upon JG: The working group tried for over a year to deal with the table issue, including linearization techniques and complex visual transations. 
I main problems we kept coming back up is: 1. Assistive technologies use different techniques to access visual renderings of information 2. Visual renderings were incomplete representations of the information the author provided in the source document, so AT using visual rendering would always be missing information 3. Visual renderings do not carry any information about the relationships between cells rendered in a table or in many cases the boundaries in cells. 
ATs maybe able to guess these boundaries, but it seems like a waste of effort if they could use the information in the DOM. 4. The idea of point-of-regaurd and focus were different for visual and auditory renderings. 
Things that make sense in one medium, did not make sense in another. 
5. Specialized navigation mechanisms (with I assume some type of point point of reguard indicator moving with the navigation) that don't make sense in one rendering medium, would complicate an already problematic keyboard access issues. 
It would also potentially delay implementation by mainstream browser developers as they try to figure our how they fit into their existing technologies. 
6. 
It was felt that emphesis should be placed in the guidelines on what will work in the long term. 
If the guidelines talk about alot of techniques that don't make sense for visual rendering, some companies may evenntually implement them, but they won't happen for a long time. 
This would drain resources from long term solutions and give the impression to AT developers that they do not have to address their technology. 
unquote, JG: The DOM provided the only mechanism that the group could find consensus on that accurately represented the document. 
The group decided that access to the DOM and implementation of the DOM was the path that would lead to improved access by assistive technology in the shortest time and with the best results for consumers. 
Some companies like Henter-Joyce are already using this model, and others are not. 
It is the groups responsibility to work with AT developers and to help them understand how to use the DOM. 
It is also important to work with mainstram browser developers to fully implement the DOM and develop and document high speed access to the DOM. 
This will be an issue during the candidate recommendation stage of the document. 
tables, JG: We have tried to do this in the past and the group could not find checkpoints or techniqes that the group could come to consensus to be technically sound as long term solutions. 
It always came back to the DOM as the only medium that seemed to make sense.
