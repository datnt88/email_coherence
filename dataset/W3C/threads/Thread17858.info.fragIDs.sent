Hello, 
The 27 August drafts of the UA Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2] are available. 
Comments are welcome. 
For those who have not yet conducted their reviews of software with the guidelines, I recommend using the latest draft. 
However this means that all reviews must contain the following data: a) Which draft of guidelines used? 
b) Which version of software tested? 
c) Which os tested on? 
Note that the guidelines were reordered in this draft. 
All comments on this draft (and others) should include the dated URL of the draft (and NOT the undated, latest version URL). 
The changes [3] from the previous draft are available online. 
The issues list [4] has been augmented, but resolved issues have not yet been checked off. 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990827/

aloha, ian! 
checkpoint 10.6, as prosed by me [1], amended by Len Kasday [2], and adopted by the WG during the 25 August telecon [3], should read: 10.6 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission not explicitly activated by the user. 
[Priority 2] and not, as it appears in the 27 August draft [4] 10.6 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission not explicitly initiated by the user. 
[Priority 2] a one word difference, admittedly, but a significant one, i believe... 
i also am uncertain about the status of the second proposed checkpoint, which addresses event handled forms, contained in the post archived at (long URI warning!) has it been dropped, or merely subsumed into 10.6? 
could, therefore, discussion of (or at least a vote on) the second proposed checkpoint for GL10 If the submission of a form is achieved via a script or an event handler, prompt the user for confirmation before submitting the form content. [Priority 1] * NOTE: This checkpoint is intended to extend the user's control over automated submission mechanisms, such as the HTML4 event handler "onchange" * Refer also to Checkpoint 5.8 be added to the agenda for the 1 September telecon? 
thanks, gregory. 
PS: the proposal for the additional checkpoint for GL10 contains proposed techniques, as well References [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0151.html [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0150.html [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/08/wai-ua-telecon-19990825.html#minutes [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990827

Thanks Ian for getting the new draft published. 
Working group members please review to see if your comments have been addressed.

I prefer "initiate" since that is a concept that applies more widely: changes that the user does not initiate may be disorienting. 
Also, the expression "activate a form submission" didn't ring well to me. 
"Submit a form" is the best - any way to rephrase it that way? 
Please let me know why you prefer "activate" to "initiate". 
I may simply have missed it. 
Did we discuss it at the teleconf? 
If not, let's put it on the agenda for Weds.

I'm not fussed by either word. 
I think that the checkpoint actually expresses the requirement of the further proposed checkpoint, which I therefore suggest is redundant and can be dropped.

10.6 Prompt the user to confirm form submission if it is triggered indirectly, that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit submit element. 
[hyperlink "submit element" to definition in HTML 4.0 of input type="submit" .] 
Because the form transaction is initiated the moment you touch any control within the scope of the FORM. 
Initiate is long past at the point we need to talk about. 
Activating the submission sounds like activating a submit element, which is what we want. 
However, it is not what the user does which is the discriminant but how. 
No need to confirm if a conscious choice to submit is obvious. 
A conscious decision to submit may be presumed when the user has a submit element and uses it. 
Otherwise, not. 
The important distinction is not so much initiate vs. activate but direct vs. indirect approach to the _commit_ of the form transaction. 
Comes back to "the system response to the user should be predictable." 
In the case of indirect means of submitting a form, one may lack adequate basis for considering that the user was fully aware what was happening.

unquote to which i reply: for the reasons cited by Al Gilman, in a post archived at (long URI warning!) i do think that there is a definite difference between "activated" and "initiated", and i appreciate Al's cogent reiteration of my somewhat convoluted encapsulation of the issue... as for whether or not checkpoint 10.6, as currently worded in the WG draft, sufficiently expresses the requirement, thereby rendering the additional proposed checkpoint superfluous, i am quite content to leave the decision to keep or drop the second proposed checkpoint to those more qualified than i to make such a judgement call -- i simply wanted to solicit the opinion of the WG on whether or not it was necessary, and to ensure that the concerns enumerated in my problem statement are adequately addressed in the techniques document... and, incidentally, i do believe that they are... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
