<s> But is there a URI for a (I guess that should be "the") null resource?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Tony  </s>
<s> * the bad news One plausible reading of RFC-2396 would lead one to conclude that: There is a definition of what it is to be a URI but not what it is to be a resource.? I say "one plausible reading" because it is not clear you will find consistent agreement with this statement.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it is not clear you will find a convincing counter-argument, either.  </s>
<s> If the notion of "a resource" is undefined, then the notion of "a null resource" is undefined, and a_fortiori "the null resource."? Nulls may make sense in more restricted contexts, but not in the full generality of "anything that could be indicated by a URI." * the good news  </s>
<s> There are many fictive URIs one can coin using the reserved domain names of RFC-2606, such as cid:garbageStringOfYourChoice@mail.example.net  </s>
<s> and urn:example.org:topic:aspect:nit .  </s>
<s> Authoring these expressions, and presuming that the reader (man or machine) of these expressions is conversant with DNS and its RFC-2606 provisions, one can be reasonably assured that the reader will understand that the string conforming to URI syntax that you have written indicates nothing more than the utterance (containing this string) itself, without connoting the existence of, or referring to, further resources beyond the writing at hand.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, if you have an application for a "null resource" URI, this technique will meet your need.  </s>
<s> * discussion What were you thinking it would mean to be "a null resource"??  </s>
<s> The notions of nullity that I am familiar with bear operational connotations.? Zero is a number such that when you add it to a number, in the end you haven't changed that number.? URIs define what it is to be a URI, but not what it is to be a resource.? So what it would be to be a non-entity through the lens of the domain of resources is similarly undefined, as best I can figure out.  </s>
<s> To say that something is "content free" would require a reproduceable test for the presence/existence of 'content.'? URIs _per se_ do not provide such a test.  </s>
<s> Beauty, it is said, is in the eye of the beholder.?  </s>
<s> Likewise, the conditions for resource-ness are left to other concerns from the context of application, at least as far as what is defined about URIs in general is concerned.  </s>

<s> Just so we squish these when they come up, that URN is invalid.  </s>
<s> URN's are specifically disallowed form having '.' in their namespace ID.  </s>
<s> The only allowed characters are A-Z, a-z and '-'.  </s>
<s> You are strongly discouraged from using NIDs that even appear to look like domain-names.  </s>
<s> IMHO, urn:example:topic:bla would be better....  </s>

<s> So building on RFC-2606 is not cool by best URN practice.  </s>
<s> Well, what you have there may have been a typo but just in case, that should be urn:example:invalid:foo:bar:baz .  </s>
<s> The period character is completely disallowed between the first and second colons for a URN.  </s>
<s> Is there any "writing of normative record" reserving this use you suggested of 'example' as an NID?  </s>

<s> Not that I'm aware of.  </s>
<s> It might be worth putting into the rfc2611bis document before its finished...  </s>
