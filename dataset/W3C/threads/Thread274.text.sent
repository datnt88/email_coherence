Dear sir, I've downloaded latest version of html-tidy to use as preprocessor in our web-based publishing system, but found out that it segfaults on some ill-formed html. 
Particular piece of html was produced by RTF::Parser perl module ver 1.07, but I suspect that other converters from office formats would give simular results. 
When linked with electric fence debugging library, it gives following in gdb: (gdb) run bad.html

Disabling optimization doesn't help. 
My platform is Linux x86 glibc 2.0.7 gcc 2.7.2 Piece of ill-formed html and my tidy_config.txt are attached.

Investigation shows that sometimes after DiscardElement call lexer- token still point to the element which was just freed. 
When then GetToken tries to access lexer- token- type at line 1195, various weird things happen. 
Following patch seems to fix problem diff -ru tidy24nov99/lexer.c

FWIW, I reproduced Victor's problem (more or less) with the Mac OS version of Tidy 24 Nov 99. 
It has the same symptoms as other bugs reported earlier - FreeNode() freeing an already freed block. 
In Victor's case, I got 2 occurrences of the problem. 
For completeness, here is the error report and cleaned output produced using Victor's sample bad.html and tidy_config.txt, 
with the Mac OS version MacTidy (vers 24th November 1999) Parsing "Work:MacTidy:bug reports:bad.html"

appears to be HTML 2.0 15 warnings/errors were found! 
This is first par fourth par I have not tried Victor's patch as per his later EMail.
