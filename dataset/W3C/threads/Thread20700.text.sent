Hi, everyone. 
I'm new to the list and new to Amaya. 
It looks like it is going to become my primary writing tool. 
I like the interface. 
Problem: When I attempt to print from Amaya 5.1 on a Win98 system, I get the following messages: Error- Source: PrintDoc (4) then either I get the Windows "program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down" dialog or sometimes the blue screen of death "Fatal exception has 0A has occurred at 0147:00008831..." or Amaya crashes without any notification. 
Sometimes the material is sent to the printer and prints okay. 
At other times only part of the material prints. 
Sometimes I get multiple copies and the printer spool talks of printing "page 57 of 2 pages," etc. 
I have scanned the archives back to January for every report of printer problems or crashes I could find without seeing anything like this. 
Is there a fix that I've missed? 
Is this a known problem? 
If it is something new, is there anything I can do to help identify it better? 
Will Woodhull Hello Will, Does your printing problem occurs with some specific documents or is it general? 
If it concerns certain documents only, could you send us one of them. 
Thanks Laurent CARCONE W3C - INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes Hi, Since I also work with Amaya 5.1 under Win98, I've made a test with my document It was printed and I got no error message. 
However, the two pictures that that page contains came out as two totally dark rectangules, and this happened with two different printers. 
Jos? 
Carlos Santos is of Amaya other copies printer Is better? 
it The problem is general and consistently repeatable with documents from different sources. 
Two that would be easy to replicate: printing the product of the "make book" command on Manual.html has repeatedly failed when Amaya reports printing page 64 and it also leaves the spool messed up; printing AmayaPage.html 
(the default home page) also fails. 
And this just failed: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; It printed okay, but that instance of Amaya spontaneously vaporized, leaving no trace of itself even in the task list. 
I just realized I haven't yet tried removing an re-installing Amaya. 
I'll do so later this morning and see if that helps. 
(rusty with this kind of thing-- many years since I've done much configuration work!) Will PS-- I'm sending this to both the list and the originator. 
Is that the group's preference, or would it be better to just send replies to the list? 
There is effectively a bug with the print command under Windows. 
We'll try to fix it as soon as possible. 
Thanks for your report. 
Good question. 
I don't know is there is such a 'protocol' in that mailing-list. 
Laurent like it the the Thanks for the info. 
And thanks especially for the quick response!
