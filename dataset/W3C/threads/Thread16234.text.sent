I have been given a second notebook to enable our CDstudents to trial linux. 
I am getting used to using jaws and ie5 and being able to tab around web pages, use shortcuts to open menus and jaws to hear what is going on. 
I've been trying jaws with netscape in windows, (until I have a linux speech synthesiser working.) altF opens the file menu and the down arrow navigates, but jaws does not give sound output. 
jaws does not read the page content. 
Also i cannot seem to navigate webpages using the tab button. 
Is it me? 
jaws seems to work with nearly all my windows applications except mozilla6/16. 
Bizarrely jaws even works with Clicker4 which has its own speech synthesiser, jaws speaking the menus whilst clicker speaks the content. 
What UA setup using linux would best replace jaws and ie5? 
Could someone please point me to some great linux accessibility links? 
ps you're not the only bunch i am pestering.

It's posted on cnet.com - I've clipped the end of it where non-PC web access techonology is discussed. 
Today's demonstrations represent an important technology shift as Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM looks beyond the PC. 
While Hortensius said he expects the PC's dominance to continue, its role will change. 
"The number of non-PC devices will proliferate rapidly," he said. 
"The non-PC style of access will become the dominant means of accessing the Internet." 
IBM is working on a number of hardware and software projects to enable Internet service providers and application service providers to deliver content suitable for any screen, from PCs to cell phones. 
In the case of the airline check-in handheld, IBM used its WebSphere software to take information from a mainframe, convert it to XML, and then bring it to the device. 
Michael Wirth, manager of IBM's Software User Systems Ergonomics Research (USER) division, called the XML translation process "the duct tape for the Internet." 
IBM isn't the only company looking closely at XML (Extensible Markup Language), a Web standard for exchanging data, which was the centerpiece of Microsoft's Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS) announcement last week. 
"We feel the NGWS announcement is a strong validation of where we have been going," Hortensius said. 
"But the devil is in the details," he added, referring to Microsoft's timetable and uncertainty about whether the software maker will support open standards or tie everything back to Windows. 
For its part, like the revamped voice-recognition technology launched last week, IBM is providing software tools it hopes developers will adopt for writing applications for both big and small devices. 
"Using our tools, it took just 5,000 lines of code to write the airline application," Wirth said.
