<s> On September 11th, the ERB spent considerable time revisiting the RS/RE question.  </s>
<s> We're just a fun-loving bunch, and it became apparent that the WG is going to have to put some more thought into this.  </s>
<s> At the moment, we have the -XML-SPACE mechanism, which toggles two behaviors: collapsing of leading and multiple spaces (essentially the HTML semantic), and passing through all the bytes to the application.  </s>
<s> Some feel the mechanism is unaesthetic and prone to misinterpretation as it stands, and should simply be discarded, with all non-markup bytes being passed to the application to do with as it will.  </s>
<s> This can be made 8879-compliant in the short term via a mechanism proposed by Charles Goldfarb, and in the medium/long term with a TC via WG8.  </s>
<s> There are some problems with both the current and revised approaches: o -XML-SPACE, although this is not documented, really only deals with mixed content; many feel it's important to ignore white space in element content; list item .. /item item .. /item /list e.g. the above but XML, when there's no DTD, doesn't know where element content is and *cannot* be made to do this.  </s>
<s> o SGML's world-view tripartions the set of characters: those that are text, those that are markup, and those that are insignificant white space.  </s>
<s> Can XML really afford to discard this distinction?  </s>
<s> o Many real-world editors, largely to deal with the fact that text (whether or not we like it) is stored in files in what amounts to a series of records, freely insert line breaks and other white space because they know SGML processors will ignore it.  </s>
<s> Can we afford to make that white space significant?  </s>
<s> o Some applications, e.g. full-text indexers, really need to know where everything is by byte offset, whether or not the bytes are significant; thus the -XML-SPACE="COLLAPSE" behavior means they can't read the text with an XML processor (unless they can turn off -XML-SPACE processing through the API) So there are a few things we could do, which are not entirely mutually exclusive.  </s>
<s> 1. Go to the RE Delenda Est model.  </s>
<s> This has the advantage that it's trivially easy to explain, document, and implement.  </s>
<s> It has some of the disadvantages listed above; there is some very strong sentiment on the ERB against this - look from a follow-up from other ERB-folk.  </s>
<s> 2. Expand the -XML-SPACE attribute from two values to three.  </s>
<s> The third would be named REMOVE or DISCARD or something, and would be designed to signal element content, i.e. all this white space can be safely ignored.  </s>
<s> 3. Add language to the spec allowing the application to force the processor to pass through all the bytes regardless of the -XML-SPACE setting.  </s>
<s> Your input is requested.  </s>

<s> Or you will just write stylesheets that don't assume some whitespace will be automatically deleted.  </s>
<s> (and leave your users alone...).  </s>
<s> The problem remains that there is no way to tell element content from mixed content given only an instance.  </s>
<s> I can't presume that I will always use applications where I have control over "extraneous nodes" as I may in a stylesheet language.  </s>
<s> The problem with your delimiter proposal is the same as the problem with Charles' explicit quoting proposal -- too ugly.  </s>
<s> Worse, it's not even easy to explain: "all tags look like this, except that if they can't contain data, they instead this other way".  </s>
<s> It is easy to explain.  </s>
<s> There are structural tags, that can contain only other structural tags.  </s>
<s> And there are content tags, that hold text -- simple.  </s>
<s> I think that this *simplifies* SGML by making it clear where text can and can't go.  </s>
<s> "Why do I get an error message when I put text between my table tag and my first row?  </s>
<s> I just wanted a caption."  </s>
<s> Furthermore, there is no "all tags look like this except these", there is "  </s>
<s> And if you change a DTD to turn element content into mixed content (or, God forbid, have a parameter entity controlling this), you will have to change a giant mass of delimiters in all your instances -- very unfriendly...  </s>
<s> As in "regular" SGML (or two phase XML processing to emulate SGML), changing an element's content model to mixed content changes all whitespace into content.  </s>
<s> Therefore, if you make that change you should go looking at your instances anyways.  </s>
<s> They now mean something different than they did before you changed the DTD.  </s>
<s> That kind of subtle change is, in my opinion, the most dangerous to document maintainability.  </s>

<s> And if you change a DTD to turn element content into mixed content (or, God forbid, have a parameter entity controlling this), you will have to change a giant mass of delimiters in all your instances -- very unfriendly...  </s>
<s> Sounds like a good reason for finding some way of making such changes easier on users to me....  </s>
<s> Call me a fool, but I think an overriding goal for software design is to make is as easy for people to do the things they want as possible.  </s>
<s> This generally means making the processing model as intuitive as possible... so people don't get surprised.  </s>
