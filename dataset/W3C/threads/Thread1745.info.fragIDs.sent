In WebDAV methods where there can be a Depth header, the rule is : "0" : the method applies only to the resource "1" : to the resource and its immediate children "infinity" : to the resource and all its progeny Ok, but what does it mean for a collection, that contains usually many resources : does the 1 or infinity give informations about the resources/files in the collection/directory ? 
It's not clear for me... 
I'm not quite sure what you are asking here. 
Perhaps if you made the question more concrete, it would be more understandable, e.g. "if I do a Depth:xxx PROPFIND on a collection like yyy, would the result be aaa or bbb".

The depth header is described in RFC2518 at Regards, Tim
