<s> I am somewhat concerned about the effect of this change on the semantics of existing clients.  </s>
<s> For example, do any clients today submit the etag of both the source and the destination resource of a MOVE in an untagged If production?  </s>
<s> If so, this change would remove the etag check on the Destination, and thereby break the overwrite protection for that request.  </s>
<s> But if we won't be breaking existing clients, I fully support this  </s>

<s> Also, I would clarify what the untagged if production refers to, and it  </s>
<s> should probably refer only to the resource named in the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> Another possible "breakage" is use of the untagged if header for PUT on unmapped resources.  </s>
<s> At least our server uses then the untagged production to check the parent resource.  </s>

<s> That wouldn't necessarily break, depending on what you're checking.  </s>
<s> I assume you're checking a lock token because etags aren't defined for collections.  </s>
<s> E.g we could also make RFC2518bis clear on whether you can apply a lock token (for a depth infinity lock) to any URL included in the scope of the lock.  </s>
<s> If we require servers to accept this as a valid use of the lock token, then the untagged production applying to the Request-URI still works in this case.  </s>
