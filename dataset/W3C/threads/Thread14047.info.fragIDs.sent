<s> Hi all, Starting in September, should we meet weekly for 1 1/2 hours, or every other week for 1 1/2 hours?  </s>

<s> I think we have enough work to justify meet weekly.  </s>
<s> I, however, will never be able to stay longer than 1 hr 10 min because of an unbreakable family obligation.  </s>
<s> So, although it was not one of your options, my first choice would be for weekly, 1-hour meetings starting as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Second choice, weekly 1.5 hour meetings from which I have to depart early.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Co-chair, WCAG  </s>
<s> Yeah, I can do weekly meetings.  </s>
