Please comment on my new prioritized goals for templates: 1. Must pass WCAG AAA 
2. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good: "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak "Braille good" on latest screen readers w/Braille display "print good" means ? 
[dare I say pdf] 
3. Should pass BOBBY. 
4. Should be valid code 
... My sense of the priorities is: should pass WCAG AAA which can be further verified by the tests you 
listed. 
Some things I wanted to discuss is the scope of the template: In priority order: 1. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good: "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak "Braille good" on JFW 3.5? 
on Windows w/Braille display "print good" means ? 
2. Should pass BOBBY. 
3. Should be valid code. 
If it passes WCAG AAA then it doesn't need to pass Bobby... I presume you are not talking about producing PDF templates. 
I would suggest for print good that it comes out as well as common sites around (pick a few from your bookmarks list). 
There is a printCSS implementation in Amaya, if anyone wants to test it out.

These are good goals. 
What about looking good on non-"graphical" browsers, such as Lynx or a browser for a PDA? 
I'm not saying that -should- be a requirement, just thinking out loud.

aloha, phil! 
since i am tasked with the same action item (preparing sample templates), i would prioritize the goals for such templates as follows: 1. Must contain only valid code (P1) 2. Must be Triple-A conformant to WCAG (P1) 3. Should look good, sound good, feel good, Braille well, and print well: (P2) 
3A. "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera 3B "Sound good" both with self-voicing browsers, such as Home Page Reader or WebSpeak, or in conjunction with a screen reader 3C. "Feel good" on a refreshable Braille display 
3D. "Braille well" when output to an embosser 3E. personally, i'm not sure about "print well" unless you mean to encourage use of the CSS media selector "@media print" 4. Must be capable of passing an evaluation and repair tool's tests (tools include, BOBBY, A-Prompt, and HTML Tidy) (P1) gregory

Seems to me that "print good" means, at a minimum: +takes into account that there are a wide variety of paper sizes used around the world (eg US letter and A4); +actually prints on the page (ie no fixed width tables that run off the side); +actually appears on the page (ie no white text on black background, that is invisible on white paper); +... 
I'm sure that there are others that drive you crazy. 
Now how do we capture that in a simple phrase?

Suggestion. Markup in XML. 
XSLT to HTML, strict 4 dtd. 
(optional) to HTML targetted at HPR and Webspeak, though I know they are good with good html. 
XSLT to plain ASCII for braille displays, with good para and line breaks. 
XSL to pdf for good print. 
Validate with whatever in the DTD of choice. 
First time I've heard a statement of intent for multi media output on WAI. 
We are getting there.

A template that did this would be great. 
But for the moment we will also need plain boring HTML templates, since ther are a lot of authors who aren't going to accept cutting out people who don't have XSLT, and don't have sufficient control over their servers to do it server-side. 
(And a lot of developers who won't credit their customers with the intellect to do that anyway. 
Presumably because there are a lot of customers who will say it is too complex and they just want something they can cut and paste text into and "publish".) Charles
