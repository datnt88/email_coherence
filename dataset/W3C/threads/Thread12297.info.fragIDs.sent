<s> Some things I wanted to discuss is the scope of the template: In priority order: 1. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good: "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak "Braille good" on JFW 3.5?  </s>
<s> on Windows w/Braille display "print good" means ?  </s>
<s> 2. Should pass BOBBY.  </s>
<s> 3. Should be valid code.  </s>
<s> If it passes WCAG AAA then it doesn't need to pass Bobby... I presume you are not talking about producing PDF templates.  </s>
<s> I would suggest for print good that it comes out as well as common sites around (pick a few from your bookmarks list).  </s>
<s> There is a printCSS implementation in Amaya, if anyone wants to test it out.  </s>

<s> since i am tasked with the same action item (preparing sample templates), i would prioritize the goals for such templates as follows: 1. Must contain only valid code (P1) 2. Must be Triple-A conformant to WCAG (P1) 3. Should look good, sound good, feel good, Braille well, and print well: (P2)  </s>
<s> 3A. "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera 3B "Sound good" both with self-voicing browsers, such as Home Page Reader or WebSpeak, or in conjunction with a screen reader 3C. "Feel good" on a refreshable Braille display  </s>
<s> 3D. "Braille well" when output to an embosser 3E. personally, i'm not sure about "print well" unless you mean to encourage use of the CSS media selector "@media print" 4. Must be capable of passing an evaluation and repair tool's tests (tools include, BOBBY, A-Prompt, and HTML Tidy) (P1) gregory  </s>

<s> Seems to me that "print good" means, at a minimum: +takes into account that there are a wide variety of paper sizes used around the world (eg US letter and A4); +actually prints on the page (ie no fixed width tables that run off the side); +actually appears on the page (ie no white text on black background, that is invisible on white paper); +...  </s>

<s> Presumably because there are a lot of customers who will say it is too complex and they just want something they can cut and paste text into and "publish".) Charles  </s>
