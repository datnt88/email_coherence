Chair: Jon Gunderson 
Date: Wednesday, December 9th Time: 12:00 noon to 1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time Attendees: 
Harvey, Jon, Scott, Al, Charles, Danield, Ian, Marja 
Jon intro: everybody needs to look at the issue list Scott: is the chucking item in here Jon: will check Al: Form sequential navigation may be combined with different kind like hierarchical nav. 
Scott: careful about hierarchy, people get confused about what hierarchy means. 
Sometimes it's like "jump to end of something", which mean up one level in the tree for the agent. 
Al: OK Jon: suggestion ? 
Al can you take it to the list ? 
Danield: related to Browser sniffing, it is a server issue but we could ask the HTTP WG to add a note about it Charles: do we want to add negocation of UA capabilities there are other ways to do that (CSS + media) 
Jon: Table rendering in CSS, like speakheader Danield: In PF, while looking in CSS2, Jason made a proposal that didn't get in Jon: DOM is another way Ian: ask for rendering of table cell as block Charles: we lose contextual information this way Danield: how is it different from ignoring table markup Charles: consider cell as block, not row Danield, Scott: API is a must, level of native table linearization is the issue. 
Scott: not hard to do, Opera does it Jon : can attach a right click script to do linearization Danield: don't know how to do that 
Al: different from JavaScript applied to all pages, it's VBscript 
Jon: related to point of regard and navigation Screen reader already have 2 different cursor Danield: seem to remember Opera does cel to cell selection navigation Ian: combine the guideline: goal is to provide cell by cell access linearize is one way, cell by cell navigation is another Jon: looks OK Charles: would like a native way in the browser to navigate link, header, form controls, *and* table cells. 
Less interested in linearization, more in this richer keyboard support Ian: should we ask that both linearization and navigation be implemented or just one. 
Al: they are different are both needed 
Ian: then they do not adress the same issue/goal ? 
Danield: somewhow navigation is more important because it has to be done tightly coupled with the browser Scott: process question: since I'm not attending the f2f, how are decision made ? 
Ian: we make consensual decision at meeting but nothing is ever fixed and the mailing list can reopen issues. 
The chair cannot says: sorry this is a closed item to the person that didn't come to the meeting Jon: wonder when this will be implemented Charles: better ask now than later... Discussion/chat follow, no more notes 
to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: 
Did we agree to take this issue back to the CG? 
It seems to me that this area is one where - the WAI would probably like to make a statement - it seems to fall in a crack between the scopes of the content and browser guidelines. 
The WAI would like to make a statement concerning nondiscrimination in the service of information. 
We can work with W3C and WSG on this, because I think Tim is quite unhappy with the commercial forays into defeating the universal meeting ground qualities of the WWW. 
Maybe it goes in the author guidelines as a not under alternative pages.

I think we should ask for a informational note to be added in the HTTP spec saying it's bad to do browser sniffing in general and really bad to be discriminatory about it. 
Exact wording to be proposed by PF. 
I am personally not in favor adding profile like things to HTTP to allow for "clean" browser sniffing (e.g. my screen is this res, I don't have a mouse, etc) It think HTTP has enough content negociation and the architecture already in place is flexible enough (where you first get the HTML/XML, 
then the attached pieces - if you need them) to do the job right (which should not preclude us to improve css categorization by media, but this is not HTTP related) 
Sounds good to me? 
How about other people.

I would be quite happy to see it discouraged in PAGL. 
I agree with Daniel that it seems excessive to get HTTP to do it on a 'clean' properties basis. 
I am also concerned that there are a number of people out there using HTML in situations where it is not delivered by HTTP. 
In Australia it is very common to use CD-ROM - most Universities, and many government and quasi-governmental information bodies use this, because the telecommunications infrastructure cannot support connections of any real quality. 
(For outback Australia a 28.8 modem will generally outstrip the capacity of the phone/data network). 
So the more that we rtely on HTTP to do, the more that these systems are going to fall between the cracks and not work properly. 
And since we cannot build telecommunications hardware, we should try to avoid the situation.

I'm not sure I followed all of the preceding discussion, but: Until browsers do a better job of following standards, browser sniffing is going to be necessary. 
For instance, IE4 and Netscape Communicator handle SSL differently, so a secure site needs to have separate versions for each browser or users of one platform will be out of luck -- and the provider will be without half of their potential audience.

Also Web Standards Org http://www.webstandards.org is working hard for 1 site serves all browsers Web &amp; nothing should impede that goal. 
Yesterday Jon Gunderson jongund@staff.uiuc.edu 
asked if the forms issue seen here matter. 
While the page seems beyond help of even the most robust keyboard controls I feel robust browser, &amp; its subsidiary agents, controls best achieve Accessibility. 
Numbers are a simple &amp; telling guide, it is easier to adjust 4 or 5 major browsers, &amp; hundreds of agents, than to get billions (soon) of pages to be usable. 
It would be fabulous if browser makers took a Web-centric position on Accessibility features &amp; do too much, not too little because beyond this title page http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds4 is very difficult frame-space. 
I love NASA sites, but that 1 is trouble. 
Having a variety of approaches available to deal with unique designs is very helpful &amp; appreciated! 
&amp; as preview to another issue: I've been looking for general support for Accessibility &amp; there's more excuses than I expected: (note GDrake's not my problem attitude) m=BrowserWatch+Chat&amp;number=1&amp;topic=000310-000000-120798-000011.msg&amp;DaysPrune=80 
Meanwhile I hope the people of Web Standards look at the next URL that illustrates bandwidth doesn't always add up to expected values robust Regards, Bryan - "I don't need to stand to talk, to advise, &amp; to generally make a pain in the ass out of myself."
