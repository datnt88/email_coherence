<s> Gregg Conformance WCAG 2.0 provides three levels of conformance for each of its 21 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> MINIMUM LEVEL.  </s>
<s> - includes success criteria for the checkpoint that address key problems and are applicable across the broad range of Web content and sites.  </s>
<s> Conformance at this level will substantially overcome the barriers for many people with disabilities, but there will be people with disabilities who will still not be able to access the content.  </s>
<s> No claim of conformance can be made unless the minimum level of conformance is achieved for all checkpoints.  </s>
<s> LEVEL 2 - includes additional success criteria that increase the accessibility of Web content, but that are more difficult to implement on Web content in general or on specific types of content.  </s>
<s> LEVEL 3 - represents the highest level of conformance in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> It includes success criteria that may be very difficult as well as criteria that may not be possible at all for some types of content or some Web architectures.  </s>
<s> Conformance Claims The rules regarding conformance claims are as follows: 1.No conformance claim of any type may be made unless all MINIMUM Level success criteria have been met for all checkpoints in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> 2.If all of the checkpoints have been met hat the MINIMUM success criteria Level, but only some of the criteria for Level 2 have been met, then a conformance claim at "LEVEL 1+" can be made.  </s>
<s> 3.If all success criteria (for all checkpoints) are met at the MINIMUM Level and Level 2, then a claim conformance at "Level 2" can be made.  </s>
<s> 4.If all of the success criteria for (for all checkpoints) are met at the MINIMUM and Level 2, as well as some, but not all of the criteria for Level 3, then a conformance claim can be made at "Level 2+".  </s>
<s> 5.If all success criteria for all Levels have been met, then a conformance claim at "Level 3" can be made.  </s>
<s> All conformance claims must include (at minimum): 1.The version of the guidelines to which a conformance claim is made and the URI of the guidelines document.  </s>
<s> 2.The scope of the conformance claim (pages, portions of the site, types of content etc. addressed by the claim) 3.The level at which conformance is claimed.  </s>
<s> 4.The date the conformance claim was made.  </s>
<s> For conformance claims of Level 1+ and Level 2+, it is helpful and recommended (but not required) that sites report specifically which criteria they have met within each of the guidelines and checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Techniques for specifying which success criteria beyond Minimal have been met can be found in the WCAG 2.0 Techniques document for the specific technology(s) you are using.  </s>

<s> A statement that materials that are created or updated before a certain date are 1.0 compliant and materials after that date are 2.0 compliant, for example, could be used to capitalize on past accessibility efforts while shifting toward the newer more technology independent WCAG 2.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> Use of the WCAG 2.0 Logo Whole sites which meet the WCAG 2.0 at the Minimum, level 2 or level 3 can use the WCAG 2.0 logo-icon with the appropriate level.  </s>
<s> Sites that have a mixed level of conformance can use the WCAG 2.0 "mixed" logo on their home page as long as all sections meet the Minimum level or WCAG 1.0- Level A. In the latter case, both WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 logos should be used along with a listing of those sections which do not meet the WCAG 2.0 Minimal but do meet WCAG 1.- Level A. These sections should not provide core functionality for the site.  </s>
<s> Information about proper use of the logo is located at [REVIEWER'S NOTE: that it is not required that they use the logo, so the methods for using the logo would not appear in the checklist, except if there was statement that went, "If the logo is used, the following have been complied with."]  </s>

<s> ).  </s>
<s> I see that you took my recommendation and removed "A conformance profile that specifies" from item #3 above.  </s>
<s> That way, we only require the authors to specify the level they're claiming.  </s>
<s> It could be done in either text on an accessibility page on the site or in EARL and could left somewhat ambiguous by the author if they didn't want to take the trouble to advertise what they've met beyond Minimum.  </s>
<s> For example, you could say something like "All content on this site meets WCAG 2.0 at the Minimum Level."  </s>
<s> And use the Minimum conformance icon.  </s>
<s> You could then say something more ambiguous like, "Where possible, the contents of this site meet level 2 and 3." Maybe the rule is that unless you provide details about + levels, you can't use any conformance logo beyond minimum except on the pages where it is true.  </s>
<s> And that use of the logo on the HOME page has special meaning and restrictions so that you can't put it on the home page if that is the only accessible page.  </s>

<s> One of the major news sources for web sites is Moreover.com.  </s>
<s> On their FAQ page they explain why they are better than free services.  </s>
<s> To put it in a nutshell they have their information in XML.  </s>
<s> Through XML they the have the hyperlink to they news source, but many times people put "click here" type text for the links.  </s>
<s> What I was referring to was using the XML source in a manner consistent with accessibility since the designer has to create the XSLT file to parse the XML.  </s>
<s> That can then turn the inaccessible versions provided in JavaScript or VBScript, and the "click here" versions into an accessible version.  </s>
<s> That would not be plagiarism nor violation of the Millennium Copyright Act or any other act prohibiting repackaging of services or products.  </s>
<s> Typically, the link will take the visitor to a totally different site which at that time is out of our control for accessibility.  </s>
<s> However, there are times when the services allow the information to be pulled into a template for presenting the news or services while remaining on the initial site.  </s>
<s> That again is done typically via XML.  </s>
<s> My home page is set to Netscape's news postings.  </s>
<s> Typically when I check a news article or current event I'm taken to a totally different site.  </s>
<s> However, the information on the Netscape site is primarily inaccessible due to their programming and not using ALT attributes or providing frame titles.  </s>
<s> If the full article is pulled in from the originating source into a subdomain, then would that resolve the issue since we are now outside the "accessible domain"?  </s>

<s> In this news feed was an article title that interested me and I clicked on it.  </s>
<s> Instead of being sent to the originating service, I'm sent to a subdomain like feed.tomorrow.com.  </s>
<s> That removes me from the originating site because subdomains are considered separate domains in most regards.  </s>
<s> Could we require that when news feeds are used on a site and the entire article is available through the visited site that a subdomain be used instead of the main domain of the visited site?  </s>

<s> I think these issues can be resolved by recognizing the flexibility of the developer in determining the scope of a conformance claim.  </s>
<s> For example, suppose I use Lisa's forthcomig RDF mechanism to annotate certain Web content with structural elements and other semantics that are not explicitly encoded in the content itself.  </s>
<s> For this purpose it doesn't matter whether the content was created by me or by a third party.  </s>
<s> Whoever makes a conformance claim in respect of this content, whether it be I or a third party, can then claim that the conformance claim encompasses both the main content and my RDF metadata, so that in combination they can be regarded as implementing the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Obviously, such a method of achieving conformance would only be practically useful if there existed tools for interpreting the RDF annotations.  </s>
<s> However, I can find nothing in our conformance rules that would disallow such a method of implementing the guidelines and I don't think any change in the conformance rules is warranted on that account.  </s>
<s> To address Lee's query, one could restrict the scope of a conformance claim in such a way as to exclude certain third party content.  </s>
<s> Again, this is allowed under our current conformance scheme - the developer has unrestricted flexibility in defining the scope of a conformance claim by unambiguously identifying the content to which it refers.  </s>
<s> Of course, from a policy perspective there may be certain Web sites that aren't allowed to include content which doesn't conform to the guidelines, but that is a question of individual, organizational or governmental policy and lies outside the guidelines themselves, which are a technical specification, not a policy document.  </s>
<s> The best solution, I would argue, is to place no restrictions in the guidelines themselves on the flexibility of the developer to identify the content that is covered by a conformance claim, leaving it to policy makers to decide whether they want to make conformance mandatory, and if so under what circumstances, in respect of what content, and subject to what exemptions.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand.  </s>
<s> How does RDF or RSS allow you to post inaccessible docs on your site for download (so you can sell them for example) and still meet the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Roberto: RDF and RSS, as told by JW let the user to receipt contents from another web site and, with "server side script" the text could be "purified".  </s>
<s> I show an example: After the first half of the page there are paragraphs with "Articoli dal sito... ": these are titles and little abstract of articles posted in another web site.  </s>
<s> Another example: this is an article from an our partner: The content of the article is also available by a RSS modified version: catching the content of " testo " is possibile to show it and replace charset, etc. inside another web site like this: This is a two kind of examples.  </s>
<s> Another example also could be done for .PDF  </s>
<s> files for make them accessibile: ename.pdf  </s>
<s> So... at least, we need to involve companies to create an alternative version of their tools for accessibility for let their customers to reach the claim.  </s>
<s> For this we have also the "support" of the national laws that are endorsing the WCAG guidelines...  </s>
<s> Let me try to explain this one.  </s>
<s> We have three components 1 ) the site - which by itself is inaccessible 2) an RDF file full of information about accessibility resources about resources.- that was gobbled gook (sorry Avi) lets try again the RDF file may say: This resources (like a image file) has this alternive text (a url of alternive text or the alternive itself) that is useful for this user profile (impaired vision) or to comply with this checkpoint (WCAG02 1.1) This recourse (like a complex text snippet) has this alternive text (a URI of alternive text or the alternive itself) that is useful for this user profile (in need of literal and clear text)or to comply with this checkpoint (WCAG02 4.1) 3) a portal: takes the rdf, and the resources, combines them to make a rendering that is just right for the user.  </s>
<s> All together you have an accessibility server side solution.  </s>
<s> Note: the RDF and the portal do not need to made by the author.  </s>
<s> Note: you can add RDF to a schema solving a lot of the problems defined in XAG for all documents baised on that schema Note: UB Access is making a (free) portal that does this, (I hope it will be working in time for WCAG02), so anyone can make any site accessible without the authors cooperation - so long as the site is valid enough to not kill Html Tidy or other XML conversion tool I had offered to edit an RDF techniques document (with sample ontology).  </s>
<s> Did we have a clear design on that?  </s>

<s> I think that we need that we need to define in some part of the guidelines (a checkpoint?) that: "An equivalent version of the materials which were not developed by or for the entity sponsoring the site and whose development was not under the control of the entity sponsoring the site must be available for use the logo for the level reached."  </s>
<s> Probably not.  </s>
<s> This is similar to the issue underlying checkpoint 5.2, though it isn't covered in that checkpoint, and I think it belongs in the checkpoint 5.3/5.4 discussion.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the question is: what flexibility should the developer have in requiring certain features of the user agent in order for the content to be accessible (to a given category of users).  </s>
<s> For example, for purposes of level 1 conformance may I assert that my implementation of certain requirements of the guidelines only works if the user agent supports particular technologies or features thereof?  </s>
<s> RDF would be just one example of this more general problem.  </s>
<s> The details of precisely what technologies are available and implemented in user agents w(not to mention proxy-based transformation services and so on) will of course vary over time.  </s>
<s> For each conformance level, then, what types of assumptions should the developer be able to make regarding the technologies used "up-stream" (i.e., after the content leaves the originating server) in order to make it accessible to the user?  </s>
<s> My proposed answer is in line with checkpoint 5.2: the baseline will change over time and we need to decide, in writing checkpoints and success criteria, what flexibility we want to offer at each conformance level in determining the baseline.  </s>
<s> Ultimately this is the entire problematique that Ian Jacobs was raising in his contribution to this discussion.  </s>
<s> Currently I don't have a concrete answer to offer.  </s>
<s> One solution would simply parallel checkpoint 5.2 with respect to the technologies and features used in implementing the guidelines themselves.  </s>
<s> At level 1 the required level of support would merely have to be declared, as in checkpoint 5.2; at level 2 there would be a stronger requirement to show actual implementation by client-side or "up-stream" software and services, including user agent/assistive technology combinations where pertinent.  </s>
<s> In the same or a separate checkpoint one could then preclude the use of technologies in non-standard ways that circumvent the accessibility support assumed in one's user agent baseline.  </s>
<s> This would deal with cases of "custom" user interface components, "custom" markup etc., described in my recent message about checkpoints 5.3 and 5.4.  </s>
<s> A few questions.  </s>
<s> 1. Would this be accessible if the person couldn't handle RDF or RSS?  </s>
<s> Roberto: This technology must be handled by "server side scripting" (ASP, PHP, CF, ..) but also as "client side scripting" (an example here all to "catch" contents also with XHTML (remember that RSS is well-formatted "like" XML).  </s>
<s> Gregg Vanderheiden: 2. Are we requiring that users have RDF or RSS savvy access?  </s>
<s> Even on public systems?  </s>
<s> 3. Is RDF / RSS savvy user agents our baseline for the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Roberto: I think we are going in the wrong direction... the original question is: if an application/content could not be made accessible (for copyright, etc.), how can the user make a content accessible for respect the "claim".  </s>
<s> No one has to understand RDF in fact, with the approach we are working on even the user agents will not have to understand RDF.  </s>
<s> This is a server side solution.  </s>
<s> The RDF allows a service or server to render an alternive accessible rendering of each site.  </s>

<s> Director - Trace R &amp; D Center University of Wisconsin-Madison -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Lisa Seeman Let me try to explain this one.  </s>
<s> We have three components 1 ) the site - which by itself is inaccessible 2) an RDF file full of information about accessibility resources about resources.- that was gobbled gook (sorry Avi) lets try again the RDF file may say: This resources (like a image file) has this alternive text (a url of alternive text or the alternive itself) that is useful for this user profile (impaired vision) or to comply with this checkpoint (WCAG02 1.1) This recourse (like a complex text snippet) has this alternive text (a URI of alternive text or the alternive itself) that is useful for this user profile (in need of literal and clear text)or to comply with this checkpoint (WCAG02 4.1) 3) a portal: takes the rdf, and the resources, combines them to make a rendering that is just right for the user.  </s>
<s> All together you have an accessibility server side solution.  </s>
<s> Note: the RDF and the portal do not need to made by the author.  </s>
<s> Note: you can add RDF to a schema solving a lot of the problems defined in XAG for all documents baised on that schema Note: UB Access is making a (free) portal that does this, (I hope it will be working in time for WCAG02), so anyone can make any site accessible without the authors cooperation - so long as the site is valid enough to not kill Html Tidy or other XML conversion tool I had offered to edit an RDF techniques document (with sample ontology).  </s>
<s> Did we have a clear design on that?  </s>
<s> I think the ontology should be reviewed by this group and in the open non proprietary space, or it will not be very useful.  </s>

<s> -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Gregg Vanderheiden So i suggest to change the original proposal of Greeg for the claim [1]: with this sentence: Historical and Third Party Copyrighted Materials Materials which were not developed by or for the entity sponsoring the site and whose development was not under the control of the entity sponsoring the site are required to produce standard output using technologies like RDF or RSS to let the site meet these guidelines rather than being part of the site.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand.  </s>
<s> How does RDF or RSS allow you to post inaccessible docs on your site for download (so you can sell them for example) and still meet the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Gregg PS I am assuredly not wedded to my text - which I see lots of problems with.  </s>

<s> One of the major news sources for web sites is Moreover.com.  </s>
<s> On their FAQ page they explain why they are better than free services.  </s>
<s> To put it in a nutshell they have their information in XML.  </s>
<s> Through XML they the have the hyperlink to they news source, but many times people put "click here" type text for the links.  </s>
<s> What I was referring to was using the XML source in a manner consistent with accessibility since the designer has to create the XSLT file to parse the XML.  </s>
<s> That can then turn the inaccessible versions provided in JavaScript or VBScript, and the "click here" versions into an accessible version.  </s>
<s> That would not be plagiarism nor violation of the Millennium Copyright Act or any other act prohibiting repackaging of services or products.  </s>
<s> Typically, the link will take the visitor to a totally different site which at that time is out of our control for accessibility.  </s>
<s> However, there are times when the services allow the information to be pulled into a template for presenting the news or services while remaining on the initial site.  </s>
<s> That again is done typically via XML.  </s>
<s> My home page is set to Netscape's news postings.  </s>
<s> Typically when I check a news article or current event I'm taken to a totally different site.  </s>
<s> However, the information on the Netscape site is primarily inaccessible due to their programming and not using ALT attributes or providing frame titles.  </s>
<s> If the full article is pulled in from the originating source into a subdomain, then would that resolve the issue since we are now outside the "accessible domain"?  </s>
<s> For instance, I visited tomorrow.com  </s>
<s> and received a news feed.  </s>
<s> In this news feed was an article title that interested me and I clicked on it.  </s>
<s> Instead of being sent to the originating service, I'm sent to a subdomain like feed.tomorrow.com.  </s>
<s> That removes me from the originating site because subdomains are considered separate domains in most regards.  </s>
<s> Could we require that when news feeds are used on a site and the entire article is available through the visited site that a subdomain be used instead of the main domain of the visited site?  </s>
<s> Lee -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Gregg Vanderheiden Hi all I knew that one would start a conversation.  </s>
<s> Because I see big problems both ways and no way to solve them.  </s>
<s> If something is copyrighted and inaccessible, it is a felony (Federal crime) to create an accessible version in many cases.  </s>
<s> Plagiarism and the Millennium Copyright Act are two examples.  </s>
<s> And there are more.  </s>
<s> Also, if you click on a document it downloads to your computer and you expect it to be accessible.  </s>
<s> (even HTML).  </s>
<s> But if you click on a program and download it you think of it as a product, not content.  </s>

<s> A film?  </s>
<s> A DVD? A PDF? A Movie stream?  </s>
<s> A Video stream?  </s>
<s> A Stock Quote stream in a proprietary (non copyable and therefore non-screen reader compatible form)?  </s>
<s> When is it content and when is it product?  </s>
<s> When is it even legal to repackage the content accessibly (that therefore pirate-able)?  </s>
