<s> Hello to all subscirbers of this list!  </s>

Did i get it right, that html-tidy is provided under a  </s>

<s> If so, then i may add  </s>
<s> changes to the program at any time, right ?  </s>
<s> (i?d share them with you, if it ever happened *g*) Okay.  </s>

<s> I don?t have any changes at this moment, but i got the request (from colleagues) to get the information whether we may and/or can adjust the program to our "personal needs" and, if so, how it can be done.  </s>
<s> Is the source available anywhere or does one need to de-compile the program ?  </s>
<s> Thanks and best wishes Boris  </s>
