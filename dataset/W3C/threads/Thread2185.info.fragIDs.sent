Hello, 
I obtained RFC1866 describing HTML 2.0. 
I would like to known where I can find the specification of the latest html version which I beleve is 3.2 or 3.3. 
Thank you, Marc-Andr?

Hi, Can some one point to me right place to find out about the internationalization of html and http.Or lemme put it in other way. 
How do I have a japanese document without having to have it in a image.i.e. Client should get the character bytes(unicode or whatever it is) and browser should display the corresponding language.Is it possible in the current state of affairs.If 
not what is the effort that is put into make this possible. 
Forgive my ignorance if I missed any point. 
Sorry if this post made it twice. 
Regards, sateesh. 
For background on web internationalization, you might see, for example, and, of course, the soon-to-be-RFC HTTP/1.1 specification: Larry
