<s> When I sat down this morning, I knew that wanted to post a little things on Hyperlinks for XML, and then Tim's mail was waiting when I started up!  </s>
<s> The basic list is good, though I second Martin's comment -- we should not depend on the presence of IDs in documents, if indexing of read-only material is a goal.  </s>
<s> I must, unfortunately, disclaim knowledge of the new HyTime stuff -- I've not had a chance to look at it because all my markup-related time has been taken up with XML.  </s>
<s> We need to add a level of abstraction to HyTime and ensure that the specification of behavior of links is in the style sheet, and not in the document markup.  </s>
<s> We owe it to hypertext to implement what we know about  </s>
<s> declarative markup.  </s>
<s> And that means that we need "declarative linking"; the behavior of links must be separated from their pointing functions, and the document instance.  </s>
<s> As we separate document structure (markup) and document rendering (style sheets), we must separate link structure from link behavior .  </s>
<s> Link structure essentially associates some document parts with some metadata describing their relations (linktypes, and anchor roles).  </s>
<s> Link rendering associates the relations with behaviors.  </s>
<s> For example: travel to role x, when role y is clicked, pop up a menu of possible endpoints, visit endpoints in sequence, copy destination text to this location on demand (transclude), etc.  </s>
<s> We should be as simple as possible with this link-style language.  </s>
<s> I don't know if we can get away with just adding some stuff to DSSSL.  </s>
<s> We may also need to think about Javascript in this regard (It's a sloppy job, in my experience, but the implementations are there, so we may be better off with it even given its many many flaws) -- David I am not a number.  </s>

<s> I heartily agree with everything David said, except for the above, at which I bristle at only because HyTime does *NOT* have any built-in facility for defining hyperlink behavior.  </s>
<s> The closest it gets are the optional traversal rules which only define constraints on *movement* between anchors or between members of multi-object anchors (what we used to call "aggregate anchors" but which are not called "list anchors").  </s>
<s> Some of these movement options have obvious natural behaviors (a "return only" anchor could naturally be presented in a restricted modal window) but these behaviors, or in fact any behavior, are explicitly *not* implied or required by these rules.  </s>
<s> They serve only to augment the data modeling facility of hyperlinks.  </s>
<s> For example, if your purpose in creating hyperlinks is to describe the relationships among the steps in a process, part of the data model of the process may be that movement from one step to the previous step is not allowed (the application we use when discussing traversal design is a Zork- or Dungeon-type game where doors between rooms are represented by hyperlinks.  </s>
<s> Traversal rules can be used to indicate things like doors that lock behind you (return not permitted) or traps (no further traversal).  </s>
<s> By "add a level of abstraction to HyTime" I assume David means the further specialization of HyTime forms to either simplify them or add XML-specific features, both of which are the way HyTime is supposed to be used.  </s>
<s> If, on the other hand, there is a deficiency in the HyTime design such that it is insufficiently abstract, I'd like to know because there's still time to change the TC if it's not a big change.  </s>
<s> However, I sincerely doubt that HyTime could get much more abstract.  </s>
<s> The HyBrowse browser (free from www.techno.com)  </s>
<s> demonstrates very nicely the power of being able to associate behavioral and presentation styles with hyperlinks based on link types and anchor roles.  </s>
<s> I urge everyone involved in this discussion to rush out and download it (Windows only for now, I'm afraid--they're not charging enough for it to support development of other platform versions).  </s>
<s> Peter Newcomb tells me that they are in the process of integrating the current SP version into it which will, in part, make it Internet enabled.  </s>

<s> It might be helpful if we can get a pointer to the latest HyTime stuff...  </s>
<s> (and I too thank Tim for a very clear startup) The basic list is good, though I second Martin's comment -- we should not depend on the presence of IDs in documents, if indexing of read-only material is a goal.  </s>
<s> Are we attempting to provide pointers into non-SGML material as well?  </s>
<s> I must, unfortunately, disclaim knowledge of the new HyTime stuff -- I've not had a chance to look at it because all my markup-related time has been taken up with XML.  </s>
<s> Having looked at both the HyTime stuff and the TEI Extended Pointer Notation, I am now fairly convinced that the TEI mechanism currently has the edge, partly because it's easy to get across to newcomers, and partly because it is already implemented in Panorama.  </s>
<s> (Blame Mike S-M for this -- it was his presentation of it after SGML96 which swung my pendulum :-) Putting on the end-user's hat for a minute, I can see the following from where I sit (and there are doubtless many others): Important o maintenance of existing HTML anchor mechanism o bidirectionality o point-by-ID } with resolution involving more o point-by-markup-tree } than a start-point like foo#bar o point-by-keyword } (ie start- and end-points)  </s>
<s> Nice-to-have o pointing into non-SGML, non-HTML documents o pointing into graphics, sound, video, 3d-space etc o pointing into other applications (eg databases)  </s>
<s> o tracking of who is pointing into your own stuff :-) Putting the design hat back on, we should probably not ignore the fact that the existing anchor mechanism of HTML does provide for substantially more functionality than most browser makers have seen fit to provide to date, and that ISINDEX, FORM, IMG, APP, APPLET, EMBED, OBJECT, STYLE, and even SCRIPT can also be regarded as hyperlinks in the sense that they state the existence of a link between point X in a document and some point Y in the external world.  </s>
<s> Finally, wearing the management headgear, I'd appreciate some advice from those experienced inside the W3C as to the pressure for implementation.  </s>
<s> I assume it is not mission-critical, otherwise the major vendors would have brought forward their own solutions long ago.  </s>
<s> Without wishing them to betray any commercial confidence, can we assume that this green light from the ERB is an indication that there is no imminent announcement of a ready-made, working solution in the pipeline from any of the players?  </s>

<s> The other prime benefit is that it can *easily* be defined to be a special URL syntax (something I've noted a number of times in the past): though we may like to use somewhat different syntax (ie.  </s>
<s> clearly label the exact specification type, define the sub-document address as a fragment ID, etc.).  </s>
<s> I've been trying to get something like the above adopted as a common way of sub-component addressing (because it can be used for GUI object adressing, OODB addressing, RDB addressing etc.) The first version of DynaWeb had support for both the above forms built into it...  </s>
