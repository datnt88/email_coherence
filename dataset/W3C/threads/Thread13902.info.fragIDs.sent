<s> hello, while experimenting with different approaches to query EARL results i looked at two implementations: * Inkling - SquishQL based * Sesame - RQL based even though Sesame seems to be more flexible (finer query granularity possible), i ask myself if the overhead involved in such an approach is justified as i couldn't think of any vital EARL queries that can't be covered using SquishQL.  </s>
<s> on the other hand it may not be wise to restrict my EARL querying application from the start.  </s>
<s> anyway, i'm just curious to know if anyone else has experience with any of these implementations and what your thoughts on them regarding EARL queries are.  </s>
<s> thanks, shadi  </s>
<s> hi Shadi I'm the author of Inkling, and I should emphasise that it's experimental, demonstrator software, which I'm also in the process of rewriting significantly, with the emphasis on smallness and ease of use.  </s>
<s> I built it for myself - I'm a Semantic Web researcher - and I can't really provide a great deal of support for it, nor guarantee that it will work in a scalable way (it can however handle 200,000+ triples comfortably with a postgres backend database, and I'm happy to answer questions and help where I can.  </s>
<s> It's also handy for testing experimental approaches to querying small documents, for example using at a WAI meeting which you reference below).  </s>
<s> If you want something scalable and well-supported, Sesame and Jena are good choices for Java.  </s>
<s> Sesame and Jena support a similar query language to Squish (RDQL); Sesame also has two other query languages - RQL and SeRQL, and support for simple inferencing (subclassing and subproperties).  </s>
<s> The Sesame and Jena developers are friendly and helpful, and can be found on IRC (irc.freenode.net  </s>
<s> channel #rdfig) and on various mailing lists (www-rdf-rules@w3.org  </s>
<s> (RDF query), jena-dev@yahoogroups.com, jena-devel@sourceforge.net).  </s>
<s> I'm part of a project called SWAD-Europe (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/), and we have been doing some surveys and reports on various aspects of RDF storage and query - you can find them here: Hope that helps Libby  </s>
<s> Pierre Queinnec and Romain Roure used Jena in their java classes - which can be found at http://encre.plastiqueweb.com/essi/annotea.tar.bz2  </s>
<s> I have Bcc'ed them as they may have time to answer questions, although their project work is now completed... cheers Chaals  </s>
