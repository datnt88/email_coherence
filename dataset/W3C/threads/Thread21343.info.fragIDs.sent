<s> Greetings everyone, I have been trying to install annotea on a windows 2000 computer using apache and mySQL.  </s>
<s> I ran into a few problems (mostly with syscalls in Perl) and I was wondering if anyone has successfully tried such a setup.  </s>

<s> This was discussed some months ago (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/2001JulDec/0020.html), the bottom line is that is isnt possible unless you want to rewrite large parts of it, and your best bet is to get a linux box.  </s>

<s> I believe this to be an exaggeration.  </s>
<s> I haven't got an annotation server running fully under Windows yet - some bits of Perl make my home Win98 box crash, and I can only play with my work WinNT box at lunchtimes.  </s>
<s> But there only seem to be a few problem areas in the Perl code: 1. hard-coded Apache path 2. hard-coded temporary directory path 3. use of syscall to get the time to a resolution of less than a second.  </s>
<s> 3. is easily fixed by downloading Time::HiRes from CPAN.  </s>
