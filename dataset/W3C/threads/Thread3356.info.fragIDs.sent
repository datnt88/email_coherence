<s> Hi I have set up an installation of the Movable Type system, for use by interested project partners and collaborators.  </s>
<s> It is a very popular and pretty slick Weblog management package, not opensource but free for non-profit use(*).  </s>
<s> I've used it elsewhere, as has Dave and others.  </s>
<s> Chatting with Paul Shabajee earlier this week, we noted the overlap with the planned HP demo work on Semantic Blogging/weblogging and bibliographic information; we thought that getting some experience with this package would be good background to research/demos elsewhere in the package.  </s>
<s> Currently I have set up accounts for myself, Kate, Nikki, Charles, Libby, Dave.  </s>
<s> I can create additional accounts for any SWAD-Europe project participants who are interested: please let me know, providing your W3C member account Web username.  </s>
<s> For technical and admin reasons this is on a separate box and subdomain from the rest of the W3C website, but I'd like at least to make sure usernames match up.  </s>
<s> Ideally it would be good to have occasional updates, however informal, from each project partner.  </s>
<s> Currently, there is just one Weblog set up under this installation; we could add more, eg with invited participation from the RDF Interest Group on specific topics (calendaring, query, thesaurus...).  </s>
<s> The site currently has some brief news items on it from me, Libby (re calendaring) and Dave (re his workpackage).  </s>
<s> There's probably a balance to be found between putting stuff on the weblog (better for broad dissemination, classification etc of articles) versus posting it to this list.  </s>
<s> I'm sure we'll figure out which works for which purpose as time goes on.  </s>
<s> For me at least, I find weblogs a useful way to keep research notes and be more open about what I'm working on... Public URL for 'esw' weblog: http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/ Admin interface: http://esw.w3.org/mtcgi/mt.cgi (username/passwd'd) Movable Type homepage:http://www.movabletype.org/  </s>
<s> It also automatically generates an RSS 1.0 (RDF) feed describing new items, so our postings can get picked up by RSS syndicators.  </s>
<s> RSS feed:http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/index.rdf  </s>
<s> Let me know if you have any questions.  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan (*)I intend to register a copy, regardless of whether we're non-profit or not as a project.  </s>
<s> Excellent. Blogged [1] &amp; blogrolled [2] ;-) Two related things I'd like to see around here somewhere (both within SWAD-E scope?) : * a list of semweb related blogs (I've got a handful listed on [2], but most of those, e.g. dajobe's, I found by chance) * tips/scripts for semweb-enabling blogging tools (things on top of RSS 1.0 feeds) - dogfood!  </s>
<s> Coincidentally I just set up an Movable Type blog [1] for personal stuff (the other one's really just for bookmarking semweb-related sites), so I'd be particularly interested in anything MT+RDF you come up with.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>

<s> Hi Danny,  </s>
<s> co-coincidentally MT just happens to be the blogging tool we are playing around with at HP for the SWAD-E demonstrator 12.1 We're likely to use it in some form so it's likely that we will produce some MT+RDF combo.  </s>
<s> Cheers  </s>
<s> Steve PS I like your semweb blog, a very useful source of info!  </s>
<s> SWAD-Europe Excellent.  </s>

<s> That's great!  </s>
<s> I'd really like to see some more interesting stuff done with it (trackback etc is pretty cool already), especially since virtually everyone seems to be viewing RSS 1.0 merely as just another XML dialect rather than using the RDF capabilities.  </s>
<s> Even something as simple as a template for including FOAF links could make a lot of difference.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>

<s> That would be great, as there are 100s of weblog sites that use MT, and many of the weblogging community seem interested in exploring new ideas for improved syndication etc. (especially if they are practical and have some tangible benefit).  </s>
