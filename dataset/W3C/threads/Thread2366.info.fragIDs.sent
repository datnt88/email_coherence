<s> The reason for asking for a separate draft is because of a combination of factors, none of which depend on this being a 'big' idea: there is not yet apparent consensus on the idea, and also, so far we are handling proposed extensions to HTTP with separate drafts.  </s>
<s> The proposal changes frequently (Friday it was 'redo-safe', today it is 'safe') and it won't be clear what we're asking for consensus on until there is an internet draft on which we do Last Call.  </s>
<s> If we don't have a separate draft and apparent consensus on that separate draft, then we won't be able to add this to the standard.  </s>
<s> You might think it's unfair that proposals that were made before HTTP/1.1 became 'proposed standard' didn't require this extra level of nonsense, but this kind of inertia is necessary to achieve stability.  </s>
<s> It is not an issue of unfairness, but simply misperception of the situation.  </s>
<s> I can see now that a separate draft was required for addition of a header (idempotent- redo-safe- safe) or method (repost) from the outset of his discussion.  </s>
<s> It might be better, then, if Roy and Koen finished their discussion of what we have term the "rel=source alternative", and  </s>
<s> a qualifed group of people took on the issue of safe, private and secure storage of post-content, and mechanisms or re-using it via a bookmark-like facility, beyond the simple, "first step" I was suggesting.  </s>
<s> Ideally, this should be done in coordination with the W3C ERB.  </s>
<s> It seems inappropriate to undertake an IETF ID that is  </s>
<s> likely to involve new HTML markup or at least naming conventions under circumstances where the IETF no longer has a clear role in the development and standarization of HTML.  </s>

<s> I too have been waiting for Roy (or Larry) to comment on my objections  </s>
<s> to rel=source.  </s>
<s> I have been thinking about writing a `safe: yes' mini-ID in case nobody else volunteers, but would like to see the `rel=source' issue settled first.  </s>
<s> I personally have little interest in taking the work beyond a `safe: yes' mini-ID.  </s>
<s> I don't think a bookmarking standard would create much added value.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> Your objection was that returning a safe URL for the redo, as opposed to an indication that the form data is safe to be reposted, is too much of a burden on CGI authors.  </s>
<s> My response is that I don't care -- CGI authors will need to do at least that much work, if not more, to ensure that the POST action is indeed safely repost-able, and having them actually decode the semantics of  </s>
<s> the original request is the best way to ensure that.  </s>
<s> Lazy CGI developers create security holes and protocol meltdown, so I have no desire to coddle to their needs.  </s>
<s> People who don't want to do the work can just live with the annoying "do you really want to repost this form?"  </s>
<s> query --  </s>
<s> there is no loss of functionality.  </s>
<s> The side benefit is the definition and implementation of various forms of Link, which is something we need for almost every major enhancement currently under discussion for the Web (collaboration, annotation, link maintenance, style sheets, ...).  </s>
<s> I have no interest in discussing any lesser issue -- my only purpose in  </s>
<s> discussing this one was to inform folks on the variety of ways that were already defined to do the same thing.  </s>
<s> Once you know what options  </s>
<s> are available, there's not much else I can contribute to the discussion.  </s>
<s> I don't see any reason to standardize something that is no more than a midnight hack, at least until someone convinces the midnight hackers out there to implement it.  </s>
<s> Either way, it isn't something I'm willing to spend time on, nor is it necessary for me, or even the IETF, to approve of something before it is implemented in practice.  </s>

<s> After some reflection, I realized that this concern might be in the domain of User Agent Hints as a more general category.  </s>
<s> So for starters, I'd suggest; UA-Hints: safe=[yes|no] And then I'd propose adding some server requests re history list handling: history=no : This response SHOULD NOT be included in a UA history list.  </s>
<s> history=noredo: Show the current response in the history list w/o ever reperforming the request.  </s>
<s> RELOAD/REFRESH by the user follows safe= semantics.  </s>
<s> history=refresh: Never reshow the current response, rather repeat the request or at least check it.  </s>
<s> history=replace: The page from which the current response was requested is replaced.  </s>
<s> This is similar to =no except that =no causes the next page to replace while =replace allows the current response to replace the previous page The default would be the current haphazzard muddle implemented by the individual UAs.  </s>
<s> The control these options (including safe=) would greatly improve the usability of three complex WWW applications I've assisted in the development of.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> Roy T. Fielding: [Koen:]  </s>
<s> Yes, that was my main objection.  </s>
<s> Nonsense.  </s>
<s> Many POST actions are safe by nature, and if POST is to be used for i18n, many more will be.  </s>
<s> Examples are POSTs to search engines and to HTML checkers with a forms interface.  </s>
<s> I care little about the side benefits on the status of Link.  </s>
<s> I want something which promotes i18n, and `safe: yes' is better at that.  </s>
<s> I don't think i18n is a lesser issue.  </s>
<s> So tell me where to look for the existing definition of `rel=source', like I asked.  </s>
<s> I might even copy it into the `safe: yes' ID.  </s>
<s> _Some_ headers can be deployed without IETF action, but `safe: yes' is not one of them.  </s>
<s> As long as `safe: yes' is not approved by the IETF, any browser which uses it as a license to treat a POST as safe would be clearly non-conformant to the 1.1 protocol.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> If we waited until everybody had a 'clear role', we'd never get anything done.  </s>
<s> An "Internet Draft" is just a working document, and the only reason for having one is so that we can have a discussion where the referent in the discussion is concrete.  </s>
<s> Too often there's a long mail interchange where someone makes a proposal and then changes it 10 times during the discussion, and then someone else says "I really like it" and other people don't know which 'it' is really the final 'it'.  </s>
<s> If something is going to happen on this, *someone* must write an Internet draft describing what that someone wants to have happen.  </s>
<s> We've gone on about this for a long time.  </s>
<s> I would like to declare this topic closed until there is a volunteer to write up and submit an internet draft.  </s>
<s> If you would like to volunteer, let me know.  </s>
<s> Regards, Larry  </s>
