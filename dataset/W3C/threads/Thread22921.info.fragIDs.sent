hello sir, 
I want to know how an xml document can be converted into an html document using DOM.

You could write a script or Java (or whatever) program to "procedurally" build an output XHTML (well-formed HTML) document from an XML document, or you could use XSLT to take a "declarative" description of how to map XML inputs to HTML outputs. 
There is no standard DOM interface to an XSLT engine, but most XSLT engines out there have DOM-like APIs that generally let you take a DOM tree and transform it with a stylesheet to produce HTML. 
Why create* methods are in Document Interface raser DOMImplementation.

All Nodes are "owned" by a particular Document object. 
This makes it easier to mix multiple DOM implementations in a single application. 
Thus, the factory methods need to work in the context of a particular Document, so they are on the Document interface. 
This is a Frequently Asked Question, and we'll soon add some entries to the DOM FAQ to cover it.
