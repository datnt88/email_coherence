I'm new member from TURKEY. 
I try to develop XML database and its views. 
The XML didn't accept this writing type with those characters "?????" ; What can I do in this situation? 
Thank you for your answers! 
It's probably actually rejecting the unclosed icinde_not element. 
You can mark it as empty by inserting a '/' before the closing ' '. Or, if it really is the characters the parser is not accepting, you can either replace them with character references, or specify the character-set in use in the xml declaration at the top. 
Jeffrey Hantin What you do to get around the non-latin Character problem depends on how often those Characters are used in your XML Document. 
You may want to look into the ISO Character Sets found here the use of XML Entities. 
To use the ISO Character Sets you insert the needed ISO number inside the xml prolog (the first line) This is if your document is written in a language other than the regular ASCII code or UNICODE Characters. 
You would use the xml:lang for Element(tags) and their childElements that are written in the other Character code. 
It is usually used in cases where documents contain multiple languages (it overrides the language declaration in the XML prolog) Or you can list your Characters in a DTD and create Entities out of them (the coversion code), then in the XML document you insert the &amp;entity; instead of the actual Characters. 
Hope this helps Liz Jeffrey Hantin It's probably actually rejecting the unclosed icinde_not element.
