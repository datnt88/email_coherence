Hi, 
I wish to manage XML documents using the w3c DOM standard interface. 
I supposed I could find in this interface a method enabling to format the XML tree content to a string value. 
This support seems to exist, but I found it in the DocumentEx implementation offered in the projectX package com.sun.xml, which is not standard w3c recommendation. 
Is there anything I missed about the w3c DOM interface that would enable to do that, or do I have to generate my own string from the XMl tree ? 
Why would there be no standard support for getting XML string representations (when this seems to be defined for HTML) ? 
Many thanks to anyone who has an answer to these questions Arnaud

Sorry, but this is not yet standardized in the DOM APIs. 
DOM Level 3 is planning to include a chapter on serialization and deserialization of DOMs, which will address this. 
Meanwhile, there are off-the-shelf implementations of this operation which you could "steal" for use in your own program. 
IBM's XML4J parser, for 
example, comes with an example program called DOMWrite which demonstrates how to output XML syntax from a DOM. 
Since that uses only the public DOM APIs, it should work with any DOM.

Even open source versions (no theft possible :-) that show some of the advantages of not having this be part of DOM at all: There are two packages there ... the "DOM2" package implements the CR (including events and other extension modules), but the printing support is in the "utilities" package and is not DOM-specific. 
The "domparse" example shows a complete round-tripping scenario: it reads a document into your specified DOM, and then writes it out. 
Converting to strings is easy using the java.io 
classes for that purpose (that is, StringReader and StringWriter). 
By the way, those packages may be very useful also to understand how the latest versions of SAX and DOM support namespaces and suchlike, and how SAX2beta works.
