This page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ says the meeting is 21-22. 
This page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html says 22-23 friday sat. 
21-22 (However 21-22 falls on thursday fri) 22-23. 
My understanding is both meetings are the same 2 days in the same building. 
The pages should be fixed so we don't have confusion about when and 
where to be. 
Is it correct the meetings are on the 22 and 23 of November, 2002, Friday and Saturday?

Hi Tex, 
The meetings are on the 22nd- 23rd (Friday and Saturday). 
My two pages 
were corrected at some point, but it looks like they are out of sync again.

Making e-Business Work Around the World All, 
Please note that the correct dates for the FTF meeting in Boston are 22-23 November (not 21-22nd as was initially, incorrectly stated on the logisitics page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html ). 
Thanks to Steve Billings for pointing out the error!

The W3C Internationalization Activity has restructured, and has issued a call for participation. 
See http://www.w3.org/International/about.html 
I just fixed the pages that were wrong; they now should all say 22-23. 
Regards, Martin. 
Team: 
Just to clear up any confusion, I have double checked these pages. 
The only 
correction I needed to make was in the table header in the WS agenda. 
However, it seems that browser caching may have contributed to some of you 
seeing the dates of 21-22 November (this is not the first time that has 
happened). 
For the record: the dates for the GEO and WS Task Force face-to-face meetins 
are this coming Friday and Saturday, 22 and 23 November, in Westborough, MA, 
USA. Please be sure to refresh your browser when you visit the pages 
describing each:

Sorry for adding to the confusion then. 
I thought I had cleared my cache, but then I changed browsers and used its old cache. 
oh well. 
At least one was legit. 
Are there any plans for friday night, as long as we are all together?

Re plans for Friday night: I guess all the out of towners need to eat somewhere. 
Logistics may depend on where people are staying. 
I suggest we discuss on Friday.
