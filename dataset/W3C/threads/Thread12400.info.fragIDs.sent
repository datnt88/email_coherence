<s> If we get a tool for maintaining ALT="text" from some combination of the ER and AU working groups and then get a massive searcher to locate every ".gov" site with missing ALTs, we could get a letter (to go with the report to each site) from President, Speaker of the House, et al to point out that it is incumbent under Title II of ADA to fix this problem.  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> The President, Speaker of the House, and other people don't necessarily know what an ALT tag is.  </s>
<s> So doing this is the same as writing to them and saying "you must comply with ADA".  </s>
<s> So why not just say that?  </s>
<s> (This doesn't help our non-American friends, of course).  </s>
<s> [Also, while ANY alt attribute is better than NO alt attribute, there are some pretty bad ALTs out there which would be considered "yes, there is an alt", but they suck.  </s>
<s> Do we really want to teach this as correct design?  </s>
<s> This is the problem with hoping to automate our task -- it doesn't accomplish all that we need to say.]  </s>

<s> The proposal to use tools to assist in the education &amp; outreach is not made in a vacuum.  </s>
<s> We regularly write to webmasters and say: "your site needs repair in such and such and here's some suggestions on how to do it."  </s>
<s> Do we ignore the use of tools to find items that need repair?  </s>
<s> Do we necessarily individually contact only those we happen to come across in our surfing?  </s>
<s> Do we present them with the entire panoply of guidelines, etc. when there is a glaring flaw that is so widespread that it forms the huge bulk of a problem?  </s>
<s> Do we continue to pretend that we haven't yet even defined "accessible?"  </s>
<s> Kynn: "The President, Speaker of the House, and other people don't necessarily know what an ALT tag is."  </s>
<s> WL:: So what?  </s>
<s> They have all expressed in abstract terms the importance of making the Web (and lots else besides) accessible and just as one quotes Helen Keller or Oscar Wilde one can quote these people when urging compliance with rules within a system ("the government") over which the people quoted have some authority.  </s>
<s> Kynn: "...it doesn't accomplish all that we need to say."  </s>
<s> WL:: Duh! What has been proposed that does?  </s>
<s> If it's a start that can: 1) raise awareness of WAI goals; 2) get more ALT in use; 3) attract a demand for accessible authoring tools from the largest customer, then perhaps we might look into it as one small step for... Dynn: "So doing this is the same as writing to them and saying 'you must comply with ADA'.  </s>
<s> So why not just say that?" WL:: Because it doesn't contain examples that prove the non-compliance nor offer a means of compliance.  </s>
<s> However, even saying "you must comply" would be a step well beyond an article in the Times extolling accessible HTML in the abstract.  </s>
<s> Kynn: "This is part of the problem with trying to rely on laws passed by non-technical people that will be applied by non-technical people to a technical issue.  </s>
<s> You and I can figure out what "inaccessible" means, but what does it mean in practice?"  </s>
<s> WL:: Actually Section 508 was heavily influenced by "technical people" and its application isn't a "technical" but a "political" issue.  </s>
<s> There was never any question that at the time Windows 3.x was being purchased by government agencies it didn't come close to meeting the requirements of 508.  </s>
<s> The absence of outcry was part of the larger problem that is clearly addressed in just about every issue of Mouth and Ragged Edge: when it comes to disabilities, most able-bodied people still just "don't get it" and we have to point out that the fact that there aren't separate drinking fountains marked "colored" in the public schools and other facilities is not an excuse for failing to make their functions inclusive.  </s>
<s> We can go on debating the niceties of what goes into the guidelines and continue issuing press releases to raise awareness, but we must also do something about the hundreds of millions of pages about which it is at least conceivable that we can cause action to be taken.  </s>
<s> Sure there can be "bad" ALTs and sure the validators will both point to good as bad and vice versa but so far we haven't anything on the table that has much hope.  </s>
<s> The vague notion of "education" as a solution in these matters is bankrupt, else there would be no need for rules, everybody would already be doing "the right thing".  </s>
<s> If you don't think inaccessible code can be effectively located then what are we here for?  </s>
<s> If you don't think we have isolated certain practices as constituting "inaccessible" then please help us do so.  </s>
<s> If we don't use some form of automation to help in this very daunting undertaking we will surely be bailing out the sinking ship with an eye dropper.  </s>
<s> What I'm asking is: "How do you see the effort as succeeding?"  </s>
