A funny thing happened on my way to the Website. 
I decided to put in some graphics because Jonathan thought it might help and others said it would look better. 
I always thought that was just short of nonsensical. 
So I put in some (supposedly appropriate) icon-like graphics and *ta-da* it not only looked different, it sort of looked better. 
Then I thought they'd probably be more useful if they were links. 
So I made them go places. 
Now the "Guideline Guide" has over 20 links. 
Although many of them are to the WCAG 1.0 and other WAI documents, several are to outside sources I've found useful in this area. 
I could use lots more - it's kind of nice to have resources pre-located and all in one place IMHO. 
I'd like some feedback from some on the lists who try the site at "concordance" for WCAG. 
Love.

Looks Good William, I like your choice of graphics. 
I would add a space between the graphics and the text, to me it looks a little crowded. 
I like the additional commentary provided by the alt text. 
But, I could not tell from the alt text where the link would take me; when I looked at the status line, the url clued me in. 
Maybe commentary, with link destination information. 
On the animation with the arrow road sign the alt says "this way to the guidelines" but the link takes you to the checklist.

I incorporated these suggestions although the alt may seem cryptic but it now gives better destination clues.
