<s> Expected result is written as: it should be: section_count 7 /section_count , (comma after section_count element)  </s>
<s> 1.3.4.2 and 1.3.4.3 are missing commas in the same place.  </s>
<s> I suspect you are using Galax, which does format the output with a comma.  </s>
<s> This query has two element constructors, separated by a comma.  </s>
<s> This comma is not text, it separates the two constructors.  </s>
<s> The output should not have a comma.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the other fixes.  </s>
<s> The basic issue with this comma problem (and the whitespace mentioned elsewhere), is these oddities make extraction from the use cases for testing much more difficult.  </s>
<s> I understand the comma is not text.  </s>
<s> It seems it should still be there because the output is still a sequence; it is not inside another element which would make the elements be children.  </s>
<s> For example, if the query were section_count { count(doc("book.xml")//section)  </s>
<s> } /section_count , then I would not expect commas in the result.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a separate document should be available that lists the expected and actual results in their normative form.  </s>
<s> The other two sections that are basically impossible to extract are the SGML section and the relational data section.  </s>
<s> It seems odd that a query must be written to "reconstruct" the xml from the html data tables presented.  </s>
<s> Cheers, --Sarah  </s>
<s> It should be pointed out that there is no normative serialization of the results of a query.  </s>
<s> In cases where the result of the query is a single document node or element node (which is true of most of the use cases), results can be compared by serializing and then converting to a canonical XML form.  </s>
<s> But if the result is say a sequence of integers, there is no definitive way of serializing it that all products will adhere to.  </s>
