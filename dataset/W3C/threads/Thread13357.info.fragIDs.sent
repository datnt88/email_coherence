<s> Hi wcag editor, Here's something that came up in an er-ig discussion.  </s>
<s> I've seen a couple of cases where people color table cells to show information.  </s>
<s> See for example discussion at  </s>
<s> Note this is a real data table, not merely use of table for layout.  </s>
<s> I didn't see a checkpoint that explicitly warned against this.  </s>
<s> For example, "don't use color alone" doesn't really apply if the fill color is  </s>
<s> black... people don't think of that as using color.  </s>
<s> The workaround for this is to put an image in the cell with alt text.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> image could be a rectangle filling the cell or some other shape.  </s>
<s> In either  </s>
<s> case there can be suitable alt text.  </s>

<s> Good example Len.  </s>
<s> This is probably something subtle enough that the WCAG should take note of  </s>
<s> it.  </s>
<s> Would another acceptable work around be to use an "X" in each marked cell?  </s>
<s> The author could also use black-text-on-black-background to hide the  </s>
<s> character on compliant GUI browsers.  </s>

<s> Yes, very neat workaround.  </s>
<s> Will forward to wcag.  </s>
