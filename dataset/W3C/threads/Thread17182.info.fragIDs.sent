<s> Hi Everyone,  </s>
<s> To meet WAI guidelines, do I have to have a label for text fields if I have the TITLE set for the text field?  </s>
<s> This may seem like a silly  </s>
<s> question, but I'm running into a problem with Netscape 6.1.  </s>
<s> When I align the label to the right inside a table cell, the label text  </s>
<s> visually disappears.  </s>
<s> This must be a glitch with Netscape 6.1.  </s>
<s> If I don't want the text of the label to disappear, I cannot have it in a label , if I want the text to be aligned to the right.  </s>
<s> If I align the label to the left, while the label is visible, it looks bad with formatting I'm using for a search box.  </s>
<s> If you would like to see the page, please e-mail me off list.  </s>
<s> The site isn't public yet, and still very much under development, so hard hats are defiantly needed.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I would rather not publicly broadcast the link, Thanks for your help!  </s>
<s> Warmly, Hy  </s>
<s> The Gecko family of browsers does not, AFAIK, support the label element.  </s>
<s> Randal  </s>
<s> It does (for the most part, before I make too broad a statement) on current Mozilla releases, but that's hasn't filtered down to Netscape 7.x.  </s>

<s> I've had similar problems, that turned out of course to be bugs in a particular level of Netscape, Mozilla, etc.  </s>
<s> The combination of styling via the DIV element, the TABLE element, and the LABEL element were the symptoms of the bug.  </s>
<s> Can you try removing/replacing the DIV element and/or the TABLE and see if the problem goes away?  </s>
<s> Also view the code in Opera, IE and other levels of Netscape to see if it is just a Netscape version 6.1 problem.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill IBM Research Division - Accessibility Center  </s>
<s> Support goes back at least to Moz 0.9x (not sure what x), so if there's a problem on NS7, that's probably unconnected.  </s>

<s> How to visual users know what the field is?  </s>
<s> The label element needs to wrap the field that identifies the field to visual users.  </s>
<s> Nothing should depend on title attributes as the primary means of identification.  </s>
