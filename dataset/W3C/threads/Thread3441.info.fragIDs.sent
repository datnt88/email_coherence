<s> Wired.com announced 3 days ago that they switched to a fully standard  </s>
<s> compliant backbone: "Wired News has a different appearance, but the new design isn't just  </s>
<s> about look and feel.  </s>
<s> The site now complies with standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium for greater access to all users."  </s>
<s> (this very page has actually a small HTML error, but the second page of the article is indeed XHTML 1.0 valid and with a lot of CSS - try the various available style sheets with Mozilla).  </s>
<s> Great news :)  </s>
<s> Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/INRIA  </s>

<s> the site now validates :-)  </s>
<s> indeed.  </s>

<s> It's written in XHTML which is not well-formed - that's worse than HTML tag  </s>
<s> soup.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the page lacks a proper character encoding declaration,  </s>
<s> meta http-equiv="Content-Type" isn't sufficient in XHTML.  </s>
<s> And constructs  </s>
<s> like or aren't examples for good XHTML either.  </s>
<s> From: "Christoph Schneegans"  </s>
<s> standard  </s>
<s> HTML tag  </s>
<s> Strongly disagree here.  </s>
<s> I do not think that Tag Soup, including use of Fonts, absolute sizing, improper nesting, Headers for bolding.  </s>
<s> blockquoting for indents, and sizing is better than XHTML, even if there  </s>
<s> are some minor items needing a change.  </s>
<s> Of course we woud need a nice definition of what TAG soup means to apply reasoning adequately.  </s>
<s> On a more general approach, TAG Soup, to me, means excessive extra tags and no organization, application of tags or elements not in the ways which were meant.  </s>
<s> I see:  </s>
<s> / and not the other mentioned, unless we are looking at different pages - this is on the index.html  </s>
<s> page that I see this.  </s>
<s> And constructs like a href="#" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('', 1);return false;"  </s>
<s> Not sure where a problem with this one may be?  </s>
<s> Why not on these items?  </s>
<s> Choice of words?  </s>
<s> Mixed case?  </s>
<s> [attribution words are not limited to lower case] Use of class vs ID [re-usable styles for same doc page need class, one time use per page ID] or?  </s>
<s> Does this page work on Text only or Lynx view and make sense?  </s>
<s> Will an HTML doc with Tag Soup, degrade similarly for those cases, and allow as many user options?  </s>
<s> Interesting thoughts you posted, but I would like to hear more about why or how this XHTML fails and why tag soup would be better?  </s>

<s> And constructs like a href="#" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('', 1);return false;"  </s>
<s> Basically, the link will do nothing without scripting.  </s>
<s> If it had a server fallback, like href="setStyleSheet?id=1", or was only shown when scripting was enabled (via DOM or document.write), then there wouldn't be a problem.  </s>

<s> And constructs like a href="#" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('', 1);return false;"  </s>
<s> Ok. Well I was under some impression that there was php type server side options or switches, for those without scripting options?  </s>
<s> But maybe my impression was false?  </s>
<s> And if this is the case and it is tied to only DOM or JavaScript enabled use, perhaps linking to a PHP sheet switch may be in order... though cookies enabled may also be a factor in having this apply to each new page load.  </s>
<s> [In which case it may be better to leave all these options up to a user and his or her learning how to use their own tools, devices, or browsers to enhance their web viewing] It would be optimal if browsers put these option buttons clearly on the main browsing menu bar as default, and also allow advanced users the option of customization of same bar if they wish to take it off.  </s>
<s> Other than that, the page, if written appropriately, is always resizable via browser options, and there are many ways that a user can define or set their own style sheets to replace any sheet on a web site, or use an Opera browser to switch them off or another on, resize text more quickly.  </s>
<s> Personally, the text sizing feature is just an added extra service and not mandated nor required on any site to display.  </s>
<s> More or less this item or option is a short cut to options already included inside a user's browser, already, and may in fact be rather limiting in size range as it works now.  </s>
<s> Personally, though nice, I think the range is geared and offered to a rather average using group, and not as much towards all accessibility users.  </s>
<s> Those users are more likely to have a battery of tools or options to use, including knowledge on how to increase their text for their own viewing after using the web enough.  </s>
<s> Though it is nice to offer added extra help in these ways, it is not really our option to train or teach users how to use their computers or devices? is it?  </s>
<s> If we feel or wish to help or give some hand in that, this is an extra plus on the choice of the designer, though not necessary.  </s>
<s> In no way am I stating or saying that we should not make web sites accessible or available to user options.  </s>
<s> Do we now need to supply various browser use information and options with all web sites?  </s>

<s> I didn't say that.  </s>
<s> I noted that this page uses XHTML which is not well-formed.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, this is not XHTML at all.  </s>
<s> When delivered with a MIME type such as "application/xhtml+xml", XHTML user agent won't render it but give you an error message.  </s>
<s> This is worse than tag soup because HTML user agents have learned to deal with invalid HTML.  </s>
<s> Of course that's what I'm referring to.  </s>
<s> This kind of character encoding declaration *is* unsufficent in XHTML, see http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_9 .  </s>
<s> a href="#" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('', 1);return false;"  </s>
<s> It doesn't work unless you enable JavaScript.  </s>
<s> Anyway, changing font sizes can be easily performed within the user agent.  </s>
<s> !-- BEGIN colMain -- div class="content" div class="storyCap" div class="pgTitle"  </s>
<s> They tried to separate content from style.  </s>
<s> The only child of the div obviously superfluous and serves no function of the contents.  </s>
<s> In http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/wired-interview/  </s>
<s> , Douglas Bowman states that he wrote "nested tables 10 levels deep".  </s>
<s> Well, he's going to make the same mistake again, this time with div's instead of tables.  </s>
<s> and are other examples for markup without any meaning.  </s>
<s> No. Did *you* try it?  </s>
<s> The "Skip directly to ... Content" link doesn't work, and all these navigation and search bars at the top of the page really don't make sense.  </s>
<s> I don't see any advantages at all.  </s>
<s> Staying positive and learn from the past mistakes is always more constructive.  </s>
<s> Wired has switched.  </s>
<s> I will say bravo even if it's not perfect.  </s>
<s> But more, what we can try to find is why they failed on certain points, as how we can understand why they have chosen this more than that.  </s>
<s> This story gives a good opportunity to write a better tutorial and to improve explanation for people that will wish to do the same.  </s>
<s> People may even want to work with Douglas Bowman to improve Wired XHTML move, version 2.0.  </s>
<s> We all learn of others mistakes, so we have to be indulgent and helped them when it's necessary and try to make it better at each version.  </s>
<s> Nobody's perfect but the openess will help up to achieve quality.  </s>
<s> As Olivier will say "STEP BY STEP" and I might keep the role of the "STRICT GUY" ;) So look, identify, learn, and improve your methods, this is the keys.  </s>
