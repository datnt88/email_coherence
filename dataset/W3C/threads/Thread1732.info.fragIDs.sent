<s> I have submitted a new IETF draft on the Application/Multiplexed Content-Type.  </s>
<s> Its URL is -00.txt  </s>
<s> This draft is simpler than the two previous drafts for Application/BatchBeep and Multipart/Interleaved and results from feedback about the two previous drafts.  </s>
<s> An Application/Multiplexed entity consists of one or more chunks.  </s>
<s> Each chunk starts with a chunk header line whose syntax is: "CHK" SP messageNumber SP length SP isMore CR LF For example, message 3 split into two chunks might have the headers "CHK 3 512 Y CR LF" and "CHK 3 358 N CR LF".  </s>
<s> The last chunk is an empty chunk with just the header line "CHK 0 0 N CR LF".  </s>
<s> I intend for the proposed solution to solve a useful class of printing problems that Multipart/Related does not solve.  </s>
<s> I also recognize that a protocol would solve and even wider class of problems, but there are cases in the printing world where a single stream of bytes is a better solution than a protocol, e.g. when the submitter of the print job doesn't hang around until the printing occurs.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate comments.  </s>
<s> Bob Herriot  </s>
<s> if this is really intended just to solve some printing problems, how about calling it something like application/multiplexed-printer-data or some such?  </s>
<s> I hate to see something which is intended as a stopgap measure given a name that makes it look like a general-purpose facility.  </s>
<s> Although problems in the printing world provide the motivation for Application/Multiplexed, there may be other applications that would be able to use it.  </s>
<s> So, I don't want to pick a name that suggests that this solution is limited to printing applications.  </s>
