<s> Howdy, I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether drop down menus, of the type that are activated by a javascript or applet rollover, present accessibility problems for text-to-speech browsers.  </s>

<s> There is no javascript on that page (as viewed with Lynx).  </s>
<s> Javascript cannot be an applet.  </s>
<s> The common idiom for creating popups causes accessibility problems, but can be fixed by designing properly, i.e. write the page to work without scripting then add the scripting whilst keeping the old function.  </s>
<s> Specifically, never use javascript: URLs, except where client side scripting is of the essence of the page.  </s>
<s> Instead, use a normal link and override it with an onclick attribute.  </s>
<s> Make sure the onclick returns false to prevent the href also working on an JS enabled browser.  </s>
<s> Note the page is cache unfriendly (no last-modified-date) and uses a non-standard HTTP header (without an x- prefix) (window-target).  </s>
<s> Dear Dey, From the WCAG: 6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other programmatic objects are turned off or not supported.  </s>
<s> If this is not possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative accessible page.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] The current problem with your page is that the high level links (Online Help, Services, Faculty Standards, FAQ) contain sub-items that are available only from the JavaScript pull-down menus.  </s>
<s> For example, selecting "Online Help" brings up a page http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/oldTechServ/onlinehelp.html with seven primary links, while the drop down contains ten items.  </s>
<s> Dave's advise is right on the money: (1) Get the site working, especially the navigation functionality, without JavaScript.  </s>
<s> (2) After the design is complete, add JavaScript as desired to provide short cuts from the home page.  </s>

<s> Another problem that seems to arise more often with javascripty sites is the lack of attention to meaningful URLs.  </s>
<s> This might be due to the extra-noticable lack of attention paid to non-visual mechanisms when coding pop-up menus.  </s>
<s> Yes, it's a problem with straight HREFs, too, but my friend has told me that, for example, http://www.audible.com  </s>
<s> presents a nightmare for a screen reader (and he's pretty good with it, too).  </s>
<s> That site has numerous other problems besides (ironic for a site that might leverage an audience of visually-impaired persons) including NO functionality without javascript, but the meaningless URLs that get read off by (at least) JAWS is what I wanted to point out.  </s>
<s> David Holstius holstius@msu.edu  </s>
<s> Some problems: If the scripts/applets are required in order to get to the menus, then some users won't ever see them - there are a number of text-to-speech browsers without javascript support.  </s>
<s> And there are a number of people who can more or les only navigate using the keyboard, so using mouse events is a big problem...  </s>
<s> It is not always clear that a dropdown has appeared/disappeared.  </s>
<s> There is a known problem with the use of onChange selectors for menus in Javascript, when a user is navigating via the keyboard.  </s>
<s> What happens is that they select the menu, and move from the first entry to the second.  </s>
<s> That fires the selector.  </s>
<s> So in allist of countries, it is the first one that is always selected, since it is impossible to get past that.  </s>
