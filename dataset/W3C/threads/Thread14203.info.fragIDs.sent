<s> I have just been looking at the whole thing a bit more carefully - it seems to me that you can either use a DOCTYPE or a namespace - if you are going to mix bits of different XML then you use namespaces.  </s>

<s> A DOCTYPE is an assertion of compliance with a data model: in a valid XML document, all elements' contents match the content models for their respective element types, required attributes are present, all attributes are within the types mandated by the DTD, etc. Namespaces are a way of uniquifying element type names world-wide; for example, when I say "http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl^template", an XSL processor knows, "Aha!  </s>
<s> This is the 'template' that I know how to handle, because I recognize that magic string!"  </s>
<s> An HTML-Voyager processor may recognize "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-HTML5^p" as an HTML paragraph, but that name makes no assertions about validity of the p nor even that there's actually anything to download at the URI given.  </s>
<s> These issues are orthagonal; you can use DOCTYPE declarations without namespaces, and vice versa; you can use both, and you can use neither.  </s>
<s> Now, I don't know which the WAI actually should care about.  </s>
<s> On the one hand, use of namespaces will probably be essential to proper processing of elements in heterogenous documents: HTML, MathML, RDF, etc.  </s>
<s> And in fact, in such documents, assuring validity is a very hard problem that hasn't been solved yet; I believe the XML Schema Working Group is tasked with that problem.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, use of a DOCTYPE does provide some means of testing the structural soundness of a document, without which it may be impossible to process the document however well it uses namespaces.  </s>
