<s> Ned Freed and Larry Masinter inform me about composite MIME types and use of Content-MD5 by them, leading to some additional explanatory words.  </s>
<s> The net net is that the computation doesn't change, but it takes a few words to explain why.  </s>
<s> I think this is really it -- if there are no objections in 24 hours, we'll consider this closed for the next draft (we have to get it out -- even if minor amendments are required later.)  </s>
<s> Here's an update of the section.  </s>
<s> 10.13Content-MD5 The Content-MD5 entity-header field is an MD5 digest of the entity-body, as defined in RFC 1864 [xx], for the purpose of providing an end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body.  </s>
<s> (Note: an MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body in transit, but is not proof against malicious attacks.) ContentMD5= "Content-MD5" ":" md5-digest md5-digest= base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864 The Content-MD5 header may be generated by an origin server to function as an integrity check of the entity-body.  </s>
<s> Only origin-servers may generate the Content-MD5 header field; proxies and gateways MUST NOT generate it, as this would defeat its value as an end-to-end integrity check.  </s>
<s> Any recipient of the entity-body, including gateways and proxies, MAY check that the digest value in this header field matches that of the entity-body as received.  </s>
<s> The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity body, including any Content-Encoding that has been applied, but not including any Transfer-Encoding.  </s>
<s> If the entity is received with a Transfer-Encoding, that encoding must be removed prior to checking the Content-MD5 value against the received entity.  </s>
<s> This has the result that the digest is computed on the octets of the entity body exactly as, and in the order that, they would be sent if no Transfer-Encoding were being applied.  </s>
<s> HTTP extends RFC 1864 to permit the digest to be computed for MIME composite media-types (e.g., multipart/* and message/rfc822), but this does not change how the digest is computed as defined in the preceding paragraph.  </s>
<s> Note: There are several consequences of this.  </s>
<s> The entity-body for composite types many contain many body-parts, each with its own MIME and HTTP headers (including Content-MD5, Content-Transfer-Encoding, and Content-Encoding headers).  </s>
<s> If a body-part has a Content-Transfer-Encoding or Content-Encoding header, it is assumed that the content of the body-part has had the encoding applied, and the body-part is included in the Content-MD5 digest as is -- i.e., after the application.  </s>
<s> Also, the HTTP Transfer-Encoding header makes no sense within body-parts; if it is present, it is ignored -- i.e. treated as ordinary text.  </s>
<s> Note: while the definition of Content-MD5 is exactly the same for HTTP as in RFC 1864 for MIME entity-bodies, there are several ways in which the application of Content-MD5 to HTTP entity-bodies differs from its application to MIME entity-bodies.  </s>
<s> One is that HTTP, unlike MIME, does not use Content-Transfer-Encoding, and does use Transfer-Encoding and Content-Encoding.  </s>
<s> Another is that HTTP more frequently uses binary content types than MIME, so it is worth noting that in such cases, the byte order used to compute the digest is the  </s>
<s> transmission byte order defined for the type.  </s>
<s> Lastly, the canonical form of text types in HTTP includes several line break conventions, so conversion of all line breaks to CR-LF is not required before computing or checking the digest: any acceptable convention should be left unaltered for inclusion in the digest.  </s>

<s> I agree -- this wording is fine.  </s>
<s> Only one very minor nit: In "Note: while" the "while" should be capitalized.  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
<s> Paul, I'm sorry, but the wording is still not right, when you say:  </s>
<s> The phrase "canonical form" is a well known technical term.  </s>
<s> It is used in this context: When you have a large set of items A, and an equivalence relationship among those items E, such that two items a and b are deemed to be equivalent if E(a,b), it is possible to define a 'canonical form' C of items in A such that if C(a) = c, then E(a,c).  </s>
<s> Given a canonical form C, E(x,y) iff C(x) = C(y).  </s>
<s> That is, the "canonical form" is a unique form of an object that can be used for equality testing when testing equivalent.  </s>
<s> In the context of MIME types, we say that there are several forms of a text document, namely: one with CRs for linebreaks, one with CRLF for linebreaks, and one with LF for linebreaks, and we wish these to be deemed to be equivalent.  </s>
<s> For this reason, MIME designates the form with CRLF to be the canonical form, so that you can determine equivalence of two text streams by converting them to the canonical form.  </s>
<s> At least in SMTP mail, text types are presumed to be transported in canonical form, and MD5 digests are computed on canonical form.  </s>
<s> By computing MD5 digests of the canonical form, you are assured that equivalent text forms will have the same digest.  </s>
<s> Now, we decided that we did not wish HTTP to require transformation of text times into canonical form before transmission, and this is fine.  </s>
<s> However, subsequently also allowing the message digest to be computed on a non-canonical form means that equivalent text streams will have different message digests.  </s>
<s> I can live with that decision too, if that's really what people want.  </s>
<s> (Canonicalizing a text stream while computing the digest doesn't seem like it is computationally onerous, though.)  </s>
<s> It is, however, totally unacceptable to make some statement that "the canonical form of text types in HTTP includes several line break conventions," because it either represents a misuse of the phrase "canonical form", or else asserts that two text streams that differ only by their line break convention should not be treated equivalently.  </s>
