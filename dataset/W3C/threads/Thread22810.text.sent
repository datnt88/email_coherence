Hello, I was wondering how it is possible to create a CSSPrimitiveValue of type CSS_DIMENSION. 
I assume that the syntax for CSS_DIMENSION is the same as the 'DIMEN' token ({num}{ident}), however, none of the CSS2 grammar expressions contain the 'DIMEN' token. 
So it seems that it is not possible to create a CSSPrimitiveValue object of this type. 
Should this unit type be removed or should an addition be made to the CSS2 grammar? 
Thanks, Blaine Brodie CSS_DIMENSION is for unknown dimension. 
In CSS2, all lengths, angles, times and frequencies are dimensions. 
The DIMENSION token is part of the CSS2 grammar: setProperty("font-size", "10m", "") will create a dimension even if you won't be able to use it in a CSS2 engine. 
Philippe Maybe I am misinterpreting something. 
It is my understanding that the DOM Level 2 is used to modify properties values of a CSS level 2 document. 
However, the CSS2 grammar [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/grammar.html], which is more restrictIve than the core CSS Grammar does not contain any expressions with the DIMENSION token. 
Does this mean that a function such as setProperty parses against the core CSS grammar and not the CSS2 grammar? 
Blaine The CSSPrimitive value is part of the CSS "core" object model and not the CSS2 extension. 
Regarding the core syntax of CSS, "12kms" is not an error. 
Appendix D of the CSS2 spec describes a more restrictive grammar for CSS2. 
The CSS Object model is used by others CSS application, such as SVG, and is not restricted to CSS2 only.
