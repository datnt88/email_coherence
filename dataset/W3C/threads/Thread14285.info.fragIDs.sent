<s> I'd really prefer if browsing the web could be a little like this.  </s>
<s> For all everyone claims for text I find links less than surreal, and very often much less than helpful.  </s>
<s> My problem with flash/director is that mm never seem to have launched a product that is used to aid browsing.  </s>
<s> The sites that use it only use it to link to their own content, and that is not browsing by my definition.  </s>
<s> Of course one looses control once the user moves on, but it would be wonderful if one could browse, even if only via a webring from one flash site to the next without falling out into the real world of text, gifs and javascrpt.  </s>
<s> can anyone tell me more about such a place, not SVG, XML and the world to come... thanks jay@peepo.com  </s>

<s> Are you saying that sites like this about as being what we should target?  </s>
<s> For example: Is this what you think the W3C WCAG website should look like to be more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities?  </s>
<s> I'm sure that's not what you mean - but I don't know what you do mean.  </s>
<s> Could you help me.  </s>

<s> i am confused.  </s>
<s> i do not understand this.  </s>
<s> does this mean if we include people with cognitive disabilities then we lose people without cognitive disorders.  </s>
<s> is this experimental?  </s>
<s> How wide spread are these thoughts.  </s>
<s> where have they been successfully implemented?  </s>
<s> what exactly is a standard for people with cognitive disabilities?  </s>
<s> one of the reasons we have text transcripts is so people people with cognitive disabilities can read the text at their own pace.  </s>
<s> seems there are many ends to the spectrum for people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> i do not see why we cant people with cognitive disabilities be a target audience where there is a whole set of different rules for these graphics. the purpose of universal design is to have one specification for all browsers to render.  </s>
<s> until the toolsets and translators come into being, i do not think we need to be including this, but be aware of the diiferences - so if people with cognitive disabilities of the type where they require graphics like this, then that is a distinct target audience with its own guidelines or technique.  </s>
<s> no one has yet to explain to me the accepted standards or how people teach to people with cognitive disabilities (PCD) and what degree.  </s>
<s> Do we need to have a WCAG for PWD and a separate one for PCD? and what level of PCD are covered in the WCAG?  </s>
<s> i think these are honest questions and not a closed door.  </s>
<s> if they go in, i suggest P3  </s>
<s> One point which is easily overlooked in these discussions, and which bears reiterating, is the centrality of language in the expression and communication of concepts.  </s>
<s> Whether it be a gestural, written or spoken language; and whether, in the case of a written language, the signs be pictographic or phonetic, ultimately, understanding of the language requires mastery of certain conventions by which meaning is represented, a grammar, and so forth.  </s>
<s> A linguist would be able to develop the details.  </s>
<s> If a person is unable to learn a language at all, then there is much that will be inherently inaccessible.  </s>
<s> This might perhaps be considered as a limiting case.  </s>
<s> Beyond this, there are those who can use language, but who encounter serious difficulties in so doing.  </s>
<s> This is where checkpoints 14.1 and 14.2 are valuable (leaving aside other checkpoints related to navigation, etc., which are also notable in this context).  </s>
<s> Non-textual representations of content can complement language and serve to clarify and communicate concepts.  </s>
<s> To this extent they serve a facilitating role.  </s>
<s> The fundamental question which needs to be addressed, therefore, is what guidance can be given to the designers of electronic documents to encourage appropriate use of non-textual forms of expression, in ways that will benefit individuals with cognitive disabilities?  </s>
<s> So far in these discussions, little has been offered by way of concrete advice in this direction.  </s>
<s> What should be added to the techniques document under the rubric of checkpoint 14.2?  </s>
<s> It is time to move beyond the generalisations and to start considering, in so far as this is possible, what should be included in broadly applicable guidelines to give substance to the requirement expressed in checkpoint 14.2.  </s>
