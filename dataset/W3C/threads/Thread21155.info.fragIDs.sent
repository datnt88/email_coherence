but in amaya it doesn't do the action. 
1] is this a philosophical thing --- we don't think it should be done so it will not be 2] its a time resource priority issue --- it is on list but not soon 3] it is a bug in the bug queue oh and we are changing it to at least add a manual link statement for those browsers that do not redirect automatically.. ;-] ;-] John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA check HTML at http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/

http-equiv=refresh is not a standard method to do a redirection. 
There are several other methods to do it with a http server. 
Nevertheless there is an entry in the wishlist concerning http-equiv=refresh. 
We can do the redirect support in Amaya, but the refreshconcerns mainly the libwww.

I would like amaya to do what lynx does - (similar to the way that frames are handled) put a line above the page saying there is a refresh to something with a link and the time.
