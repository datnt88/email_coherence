As far as I can tell, the most recent document defining the Content-language header is RFC1766. 
But, according to the RFC index: 1766 Tags for the Identification of Languages. 
H. Alvestrand. 
March 1995. 
(Format: TXT=16966 bytes) (Obsoleted by RFC3066) (Status: PROPOSED STANDARD) But RFC3066 says nothing about Content-language, other than it being moved to another document. 
I have failed to discover what other document. 
#g Graham Klyne (GK@ACM.ORG) draft-alvestrand-content-language-02.txt. 
Ned Graham - Harald is working on that document. 
Draft at Regards, Martin.
