Where do we go from here? 
I think the first order of bussiness might be to discuss whether or not XPath should have an API at all. 
XPath is meant to be a normative, abstract, standard, above XPointer, XSLT, and XML Query (hopefully). 
Maybe 
what people really need is an XML Query API or an XPointer API. 
If it's an XML Query API, it's way early to be discussing this. 
On the other hand, 
XML Query and XPointer don't really return the result of a random expression, like "2+2". 
So I dunno. 
I would really *not* like to see something like getNodes(XPath expression) as a method on Node. 
DOM2 is already way too bloated.

Yes, but XPath is the closest thing we have to a standard query language for XML, people need to do queries on XML documents, so why not an XPath API? 
Good, let's get the discussion going! 
This is more or less what Microsoft supports as a DOM extension, people use it all the time, it seemed like a good starting point for a proposed standard API. 
Why don't you want to see this in the standard DOM? 
It's an optional module, so it won't contribute to "bloat" (and anyway, one person's bloat is another's core feature). 
So, what is wrong with the proposal NodeList getNodesByXPath(DOMString xpathExpression) as a standard DOM method? 
The objections I've heard are: - The result shouldn't be a NodeList - We should allow other query languages than XPath Discussion?

its inadequate in one sense, overkill in others. 
Overkill insomuch as: Any such function could return object, from which its type could be determined. 
inadequate in that it may return any one of the xpath object types (I think). 
The boolean test is an obvious example. 
Its this I'm pondering at the moment. 
And I can't see anything obvious. 
But yes Scott, I do want 'an api' to either a query lang, xpointer or 'something'. 
If it does what I want, fine. 
DOM is questionably imperfect, but adequate today. 
Part of the DOM? 
No need, if I can 'call on' the standard dom api as and when needed. 
I think java permits that doesn't it?

And we should be able to optionally bind XPath variables...
