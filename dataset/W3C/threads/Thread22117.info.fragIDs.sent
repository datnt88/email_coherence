<s> Where do we go from here?  </s>
<s> I think the first order of bussiness might be to discuss whether or not XPath should have an API at all.  </s>
<s> XPath is meant to be a normative, abstract, standard, above XPointer, XSLT, and XML Query (hopefully).  </s>
<s> Maybe  </s>
<s> what people really need is an XML Query API or an XPointer API.  </s>
<s> If it's an XML Query API, it's way early to be discussing this.  </s>
<s> On the other hand,  </s>
<s> XML Query and XPointer don't really return the result of a random expression, like "2+2".  </s>
<s> So I dunno.  </s>
<s> I would really *not* like to see something like getNodes(XPath expression) as a method on Node.  </s>
<s> DOM2 is already way too bloated.  </s>
<s> -scott  </s>
<s> Yes, but XPath is the closest thing we have to a standard query language for XML, people need to do queries on XML documents, so why not an XPath API?  </s>
<s> Good, let's get the discussion going!  </s>
<s> This is more or less what Microsoft supports as a DOM extension, people use it all the time, it seemed like a good starting point for a proposed standard API.  </s>
<s> Why don't you want to see this in the standard DOM?  </s>
<s> It's an optional module, so it won't contribute to "bloat" (and anyway, one person's bloat is another's core feature).  </s>
<s> So, what is wrong with the proposal NodeList getNodesByXPath(DOMString xpathExpression) as a standard DOM method?  </s>
<s> The objections I've heard are: - The result shouldn't be a NodeList - We should allow other query languages than XPath Discussion?  </s>

<s> its inadequate in one sense, overkill in others.  </s>
<s> Overkill insomuch as: Any such function could return object, from which its type could be determined.  </s>
<s> inadequate in that it may return any one of the xpath object types (I think).  </s>
<s> The boolean test is an obvious example.  </s>
<s> Its this I'm pondering at the moment.  </s>
<s> And I can't see anything obvious.  </s>
<s> But yes Scott, I do want 'an api' to either a query lang, xpointer or 'something'.  </s>
<s> If it does what I want, fine.  </s>
<s> DOM is questionably imperfect, but adequate today.  </s>
<s> Part of the DOM?  </s>
<s> No need, if I can 'call on' the standard dom api as and when needed.  </s>
<s> I think java permits that doesn't it?  </s>
<s> Regards DaveP  </s>
<s> And we should be able to optionally bind XPath variables...  </s>
