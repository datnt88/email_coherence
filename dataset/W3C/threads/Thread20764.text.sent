Hello Brant, I could reproduce your bug, when I click with the right button. 
If I double click with the left button I get the warning message saying that we cannot browse mailto: URLs. 
We just forgot to do that test for the right button. 
Does this correspond to the behaviour you report? 
-jose Yes, it does.
