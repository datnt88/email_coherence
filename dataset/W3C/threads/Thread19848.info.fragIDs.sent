Hi Ramzi , I am building Amaya 1.2 on Windows NT . 
I am able to compile/link Amaya. 
1. 
I cannot bring up the executable I copied *.PRS *.TRA etc files to $THOTDIR/amaya directory as you mentioned earlier. 
However the executable runs fine when run from the Binary source enviornment (downloaded from web). 
2. Keyboard functionality : In the binary version downloaded from web, Keyboard functionality does not work and so is the case with newly generated executable. 
Thanks in Advance Suhas 
Hi, 
I did the same thing and it works. 
Do you copied *.STR files in $THOTDIR/WINNT/amaya ? 
Check this and try again. 
What do you mean by keyboard functionality ?

Please find attached to this mail the file amaya.keyboard 
used by Amaya on Windows. 
Thsi short cuts are not the same for Windows and Solaris/Linux. 
For example: Solaris/Linux Windows CNTRL KEY 1 for Heading 1 Alt Key 1
