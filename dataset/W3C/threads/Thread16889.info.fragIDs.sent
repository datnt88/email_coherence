<s> I've always used ID and HEADER attributes when creating accessible data tables, but after reading the Access Board's bit for 508 compliant tables, I might user SCOPE instead.  </s>

<s> When browser makers didn't implement scope people got laughed at  </s>
<s> for suggesting using it (understandable really) with the result that people  </s>
<s> who write sites got given the hard way first, and had to wait for the simple  </s>

<s> Unfortunately (but again understanably really) users don't change their  </s>

<s> Below I have pasted a listing on how HPR, Window-Eyes and JAWS support various forms of table markup - these results are for versions a few months ago.  </s>
<s> The bottom line is that for programmatic identification of table headings, TH with scope is best because it is simplest and is supported as well as headers and id's.  </s>
<s> If the table is complex ("more than one Logical level of row and column headers") then your must use headers and id's because headings will not be properly identified with TH and scope.  </s>
<s> The chances of errors and the time required to touch each cell of a data  </s>
<s> table when using headers/id leads me to recommend that web developers revisit the design of the table; probably it can be simplified, possibly with multiple tables.  </s>
<s> The versions for this test are JFW 4.01, HPR 3.02 and Window-Eyes 4.11.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> No special markup - row one and column one for headings: JFW, Window-Eyes, HPR. 2. Scope attribute on either TH's or TD's - JFW and HPR. 3. Axis attribute on TH's or TD's - JFW. 4. Use TH for headings - JFW and HPR. 5. Headers attribute with id's specifying heading cells - JFW and HPR. 6. abbr attribute on heading cells - JFW and HPR.

<s> The other point is that the screen readers do a pretty good picking up the top row of column headings and first column of row headings all by themselves, without even TH's - so the real requirement is if you can't design (or re-design) a simple table, use the headers= attribute on complex tables.  </s>
