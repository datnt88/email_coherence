Hello, Brain dump for archival purposes on some disadvantages and advantages of plain text, text-only pages, alternative text pages, rich multimedia content, and dynamic content. 
Your comments and additions welcome! 1) Plain text (i.e., no markup): Advantages: may be rendered by readily available assistive technologies in three modes: graphically, as speech, and as Braille. 
Disadvantages: 1) does not support structure, navigation, style, and other features that promote accessibility. 
2) Unusable today by deaf non-readers 3) Probably useless to some users with cognitive disabilities. 
2) Text-only pages (may include markup but no audio, video, etc.) Advantages beyond plain text: linking, navigation, styling, and other processing possible. 
Disadvantages beyond plain text: None? 3) Alternative text-only pages. 
Advantages: Combined with "primary" pages, may produce an accessible whole. 
Disadvantages: 1) Two pages are harder to manage than one. 
2) The world is not binary; people can generally use various types of content with differing degrees of success. 
Pushing some content to an alternative text-only page creates an artificial dichotomy 3) You lose fine-grain relationships among content. 
If, instead of knowing that a particular piece of text is an "alt" to an IMG element, the only thing you know is that page B is a text-only alternative to page A, you build an information-poor Web. 4) Rich multimedia pages: Advantages: When accessible, provide information most users can use. 
Disadvantages even when authored accessibly: 1) May be slow to download (implementation issue, though real). 
2) May be unusable to some users unless there is adequate control in user agents to suppress interfering background images, etc. 5) Dynamic pages: Advantages: Useful for conveying changes in information. 
Disadvantages: 1) May be unusable to some users unless there is adequate control in user agents to allow control of the rate of change. 
2) May cause problems to some assistive technologies (implementation issue, though real) Other topics?? - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 have a look at what I did to http://www.special-needs-company.com/ as an alternative, that is accessible, but is a far cry for "text only" - note: it is a cgi program so that text changes are automatically updated, no human input or management. 
(pictures take some human input to set the alt tag.) 
Text only with markup louses helping Probably useless some users with cognitive disability and the rest of us, the clarity that diagrams and picture can provide.

I am confident that we will generate the meat for this report as we fly from Newark to London.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Some further thoughts about alternative text-only versions... + no good to people with comprehension problems. 
+ Does not contain any other media (obviously). 
Some users find it easier to work primarily in a text mode but can make use of media elements. 
For example, many blind users have an audio player or three attached to their text-based browser, and people who have some vision (me for example) may occasionally open an image in a viewer. 
If the images are not there that's not possible.

"Boring" for some of us is the use of effects whose impact decreases with time from "what's that?" to "why's that?" 
The alternate site isn't just more accessible, it's more usable without the visually boring clutter of re-arranging letters. 
The most "annoying" part is that it's still too tedious to get into a position to use the part that reads the site aloud since it requires some techno-geek downloading/installing a plug-in that still isn't a part of many (most? 
any?) browsers. 
The information in the site should be the "star of the show" and if I had need/interest in the contents I'm sure I could get them out. 
If I don't have that need then no presentational legerdemain will instill it. 
Only the author knows whether the presentation enhances the content or merely fills some otherwise unmet artistic bent. 
Despite McLuhan's contrary claim, the message is the message and the medium is but a messenger (whom we needn't kill because we don't like the message). 
You are the one in this group who has some knowledge of and ability in deciding what works to the extent that it warrants notice/inclusion in the guidelines. 
If auto-re-arranging text has some merit beyond novelty then explain that (hopefully with studies to prove it's true) here and we'll take steps to include it in the guidelines. 
If any form of "enhancement" of content is important in the field you till then help us learn about that. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE How about "a text-only site doesn't take into account what we _know_ to be the advantages of good visual design"? 
We have to be careful that we do not forget that visual design _is_ a useful and enhancing endeavor. 
When done correctly, the content _is_ made easier to comprehend through good design. 
If we deny this then we are being less than honest. 
The fact that there are many examples of _poor_ visual design should not discount the fact that _good_ visual design has numerous benefits for visually-oriented audiences. 
If we dismiss this too easily then we risk alienating anyone who does rightly understand the benefits of visual design. 
This, I think, is a better statement of the "boring" sentiment -- a visually uninteresting presentation _does_ detract from the ability of visual users to experience the content.

My apologies for the inappropriate use of the word "boring". 
"Boring" has to be one of the more subjective words in the English language. 
The point I was trying to make is this - Some people like animations and graphics. 
You may not be among them, but there are, oh so many different types of sites, and what may be considered an excellent presentation of the WAI home page (well done Wendy), may be considered a second best for, say a teenage environmental awareness site. 
People spend time and money on making animations that you or I do not like - but they do like them. 
(I caught myself referring to some new music trend as "noise" - same idea) We can make recommendations about accessibility but not about taste. 
We must try to find ways to facilitate different tastes with in the WAI, whether they are our tastes or not. 
Sorry to have dragged everyone into this.
