<s> If you want Tidy to take 98% of CPU usage and fill up your 40 Gig HDD in less than 3 min do what i did.  </s>
<s> Write a Cold fusion script using CFEXECUTE triggering a simple shell script such as this #! /bin/sh /usr/local/bin/tidy -config /etc/tidyconfig.txt  </s>
<s> /home/user/HTMLFILES/* to run tidy over a directory full of HTML files.  </s>
<s> Then make sure in your tidy config file you have this line == error-file: /home/user/HTMLFILES/ (pointing to the same directory where the HTML files are) and run the script.  </s>

<s> You might have mail.  </s>
<s> I think I asked this question the other day but never got a reply  </s>
<s> Several possibilities could account for that : 1) I replied to the list, not to you directly - I assumed that all posters to the list are also subscribers - if someone tells me that is a false assumption, I will start replying to BOTH the poster and list.  </s>
<s> I personally don't like receiving duplicate posts.  </s>
<s> I guess it depends on how smart the listserv/mail software is.  </s>
<s> 2) You are in a different time zone, far far away from the host for the mailing list - there are likely some propagation delays, plus depending on when you sleep... 3) The reliability of listserv servers, EMail, and the Internet in general grin .  </s>
<s> My comment would be wait at least 48 hours before saying no reply was received.  </s>
<s> IS THERE A NEW TIDY.EXE AN WERE DO YOU GET IT FROM.  </s>
<s> I will repeat the answer I gave previously : Depends on whether you want pre-built binaries for certain platforms, or if you are capable of downloading the source and building it for yourself.  </s>
<s> 1) Pre-built binaries (betas, for some platforms) : 2) Source code (current, for all supported platforms) : Hope this helps.  </s>
