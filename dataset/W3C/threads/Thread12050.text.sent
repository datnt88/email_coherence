Reference document: 1) Checkpoint 2.3.2: 
Change "is conformant to" to "conforms to". 
Make this change globally. 
2) Checkpoint 2.3.3: 
Change "are conformant to" to "conform to". 
3) Guideline 2.4: In intro text, rather than say that text equivalents are "absolutely necessary", just explain why they are important: they may be rendered as speech, braille, and visually. 
Change the second sentence to read something like "Since producing text equivalents can be a time-consuming task..." and then merge with the second paragraph. 
For example: "Textual equivalents, including "alt-text", long descriptions, video captions, and transcripts make multimedia content accessible since text may be rendered as speech, braille, and visually. 
[Add more rationale here if desired, stealing from WCAG.] Since producing text equivalents can be a time-consuming task, authoring tools should assist the author with mechanical tasks (such as?) and help the author ensure that text equivalents accurately convey the functionality of the related multimedia object. 
4) Drop "This will lead to an increase in the average quality of descriptions used." 
I don't think this prediction is necessary, in particular because just before it there are four good reasons to include pre-written descriptions. 
What does "average quality" mean? 
5) In checkpoints 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, change "information" to "markup". 
6) In checkpoint 2.4.2, language changes are mentioned. 
How does the tool know when the language changes in the document? 
If known automatically, the tool should insert the markup itself. 
If not known automatically, it can't alert the user when the information is missing. 
7) Checkpoint 2.4.5: change ", which" to "that".

CMN I agree with your principles here. 
I will leave it for this draft, because I think the point raised by WIlliam that it might be worthwhile discussing the use of non-text alternatives is also valid, and I think we should wait at least to see what the WCAG group comes up with on those lines this thursday. 
IJ 5) In checkpoints 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, change "information" to "markup". 
CMN It doesn't make sense in 2.4.2 - the author should be prompted for information, which may or may not be markup. 
It may make sense in 2.4.3 but I think not, for the same reason. 
Noted issue for the group (this is part of the "how do we define content, markup, etc question). 
IJ 6) In checkpoint 2.4.2, language changes are mentioned. 
How does the tool know when the language changes in the document? 
If known automatically, the tool should insert the markup itself. 
If not known automatically, it can't alert the user when the information is missing. 
CMN THe technique (now slightly modified) says that if there are changes in the character set used, prompt the author to identify possible changes in language. 
It is also possible to ask the author straight out whether there are changes in language (or abbreviations, etc) within the document - Bobby does stuff like this. 
If you think the example is a bad one we can remove it, but I have let it stand for now.
