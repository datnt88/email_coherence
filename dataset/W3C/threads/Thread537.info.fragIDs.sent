<s> I was in the process of automating nightly builds and uploads of tarballs when my access to the SF compile farm got corrupted.  </s>

<s> I don't find it a nuisance, and you should be able to get the whole thing with a single CVS command.  </s>
<s> I personally use a GUI based CVS tool, and it works great for me.  </s>
<s> But to prove that it can be done with a single CVS command, I have copied the command I used while automating the builds (I have left out stuff that is not needed) : cd tidy; cvs -d ':pserver:anonymous@cvs.tidy.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tidy'  </s>

<s> This was on the SF compile farm, using the "bash" shell, mostly on some version of Linux.  </s>
