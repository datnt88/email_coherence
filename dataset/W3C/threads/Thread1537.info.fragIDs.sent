<s> The question we have to ask ourselves is if there is any need to have precursor information available in an interoperable way.  </s>
<s> I don't know off the top of my head any other system that supports this, but it could be something I just never used.  </s>
<s> I also agree with Geoff in that there are good arguments either way.  </s>
<s> However I'd lean in the direction of leaving things out if there is any doubt.  </s>
<s> They can always be added in later when we have more experience and the use cases are more crisp.  </s>
<s> We don't want to hold up the protocol on such issues either if we can help it.  </s>
<s> I still can't see where it is useful to know about two different version histories, one that you have poor information on (the source of the COPY) and an old version history that is no longer relevent to the actual content (since you overlayed it).  </s>
