<s> Hi Eric, I am still experiencing problems with the annotation service.  </s>
<s> I can download the annotation index and all the annotations fine, but all authorisation operations fail - why is that ?  </s>
<s> When trying to create an annotation I keep getting HTTP 401 responces !  </s>
<s> Should I register again?  </s>
<s> (i.e. is my credentials not valid after the upgrade?)  </s>

<s> Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong error.  </s>
<s> I was looking for errors with a certain symptom, but they haven't occured since yesterday at 03:21 GMT.  </s>
<s> [Mon Aug 26 03:21:05 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: /var/www/annotations I did an upgrade to last night at 23:50 GMT.  </s>
<s> Could you tell me the exact time you get such an error?  </s>
<s> Then I can look in the error log and see if it gives me a clue.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry, but you seem to have gotten involved in a system bug here.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we'll be able to track it down quickly.  </s>
<s> Let's start with the exact time of a failure and see if we can work with that.  </s>
<s> Again, I'm sorry for the downtime.  </s>
