I been using Tidy to clean Word 2000 documents and get them ready for the Web. 
Tidy seems to be doing a great job, the only tags that are left that I still want to get rid of are the class attributes: How can I do this either in the UI for Win32 or command line Tidy? 
Cristian Balan Instructional Technology Plattsburgh State University i don't think this is possible[1]. 
:( try either: - textism's word html cleaner[2], or - roll your own perl solution with MKDoc::XML::Stripper[3] warning: the perl solution requires xml input, so you'll need to run it through tidy first with the output-xhtml option (if you're throwing it html). 
hth, - p 1. http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html 2. http://www.textism.com/resources/cleanwordhtml/ 
3. http://search.cpan.org/~jhiver/MKDoc-XML/lib/MKDoc/XML/Stripper.pm 
A roll your own solution using Regular expressions could be something as simple as this ... (example in javascript) function stripClass(content) oReg = new RegExp("( [^ ]+) class=[^ |^ ]*([^ ]* )","ig"); return content.replace(oReg, 
"$1 $2"); content = stripClass('This is some HTML code p align="center" class="Rubbish" Text /p '); Cheers Ben From: html-tidy-request@w3.org [mailto:html-tidy-request@w3.org]
