<s> During yesterday's call I asked group members to test this definition by attempting to find examples of authoring tool functionality that would not fall under one or another of the categories proposed.  </s>
<s> Please continue this exercise on the list.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan  </s>
<s> Authoring Tool: Any software that an author may use to create or modify Web content.  </s>
<s> This includes software that enables an author (the user, the controller, collaborating authors, etc.) to perform any of the following functions: o Text Editing ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate plain text data (e.g. markup text, program code, etc.).  </s>
<s> o Symbol-Based Editing ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate non-WYSIWYG symbols that represent functional groups in the underlying plain text data (e.g. markup element, programming code operation, multi-element placeholder, etc.) o WYSIWYG Document Editing ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate renderings of underlying the underlying plain text data (e.g. text in a paragraph, an image, a table, etc) encoded in publishing language formats (e.g. HTML, etc.).  </s>
<s> o Object-Oriented Graphics Editing ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate renderings of object-oriented graphics (i.e. draw formats as opposed to paint formats).  </s>
<s> o Template-Based Editing ?  </s>
<s> Enter high-level inputs that result in Web content that is largely template-based (e.g. Site Creation Wizards, Site Management Tools, Courseware, Content Aggregators, Chat and Whiteboard systems, etc.) o Time-line Editing ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate time dependent Web content (e.g. animation, music, etc.) using a user interface that represents a series of frames.  </s>
<s> For the editing of each frame, see the other types of authoring tool functionalities in this list.  </s>
<s> o Format Conversion ?  </s>
<s> Manipulate Web content encoded in one format so that it becomes encoded in another.  </s>
<s> Includes functionality for saving Web content created in one format in a different format or importing Web content from one format into a different format.  </s>
<s> This list does not includes the following software functions: o Fully-Automatic Web Content Generation ?  </s>
<s> Software that produces Web content without any input whatsoever from the author.  </s>
<s> For example, an automated ?stock  </s>
<s> ticker?  </s>
<s> that continuously produces Web content without any user control, would not be considered an authoring tool.  </s>
<s> Note: The programmer of a software is not the author (i.e. the user) of the software.  </s>
<s> Even so, WCAG still applies to the software doing the Fully-Automatic Web Content Generation and ATAG still applies to any tools used to program the software.  </s>
<s> To help people see what I'm getting at with my definition of "authoring tool", I've pulled together some example images - one for each category (see attached).  </s>
<s> I've also made some edits to the definitions to make them a bit easier to interpret (I hope).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan Jan Richards, User Interface Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto Web: http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/jan/richards.html  </s>
<s> I have an action item to propose an authoring tool definition as well as a system for organizing the techniques for the upcoming F2F.  </s>
<s> The attached file contains this proposed definition along with updated screenshot examples.  </s>
<s> Download and unzip the file, then launch: Definition of Authoring Tool (Draft 2).html  </s>
<s> I believe that we can use the same categories to do the technique organization.  </s>
