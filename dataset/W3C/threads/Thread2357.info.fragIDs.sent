<s> Quick suggestion: There's some ISO standard, don't know which, which suggests to use this notation for dates: YEAR-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ or something like that.  </s>
<s> This format is very handy as you can use lexical comparison to compare times.  </s>
<s> Therefore it would be a plus to have this in some future HTTP version.. Maybe one should introduce acceptance of this style with HTTP/1.1 already so one can switch to this syntax only sometime in the future..  </s>
<s> Best regards,  </s>
<s> Yes, this date format is a definite winner, *and* for you bitheads, it saves a couple of characters in every date header.  </s>
<s> We use an ISO hierarchy in our Persistent Document Identifier scheme.  </s>
<s> Works nicely to produce chronologically sorted directories world wide as it provide hierarchy in an identifier.  </s>
<s> We also use these for http logging.  </s>
<s> First of all, your assertion that lexical ordering suffices to compare values of this sort is trivially shown to be false.  </s>
<s> Suppose I have the two values: 1990-04-04 07:00:00 -7000 1990-04-04 00:00:00 +0000 A lexical comparison will find these values to be different when in fact they are the same.  </s>
<s> If you want to compare time values you have to either normalize them with respect to zone or else figure out a way to rank times in different zones.  </s>
<s> This takes the problem out of the realm of simply lexical comparison from the outset, for the format you propose at least.  </s>
<s> Second, ISO standards define a zillion different formats for time values, but as far as I know the one you describe isn't one of them.  </s>
<s> (It is, however, quite possible that such a format exists and I am unaware of it, as a complete set of ISO specifications will easily fill a large bookcase completely.) The ASN.1 specifications, for example, define universal time, which can be either YYMMDDHHMMZ, YYMMDDHHMMSSZ, YYMMDDHHMM+ZZZZ, or YYMMDDHHMMSS+ZZZZ.  </s>
<s> (There are also some broken implementations around that generate +ZZ instead of +ZZZZ.  </s>
<s> Also note the use of two digit years here, and the inability to tell the difference between a four digit year and the presence/absence of seconds.  </s>
<s> ASN.1 universal times are a monumentally poor way to represent time values in my opinion.) There is also ASN.1 generalized time, which has a whole bunch of different forms, including YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.SSSZ and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.SSS+ZZZZ and a bunch of others.  </s>
<s> This is a much better way to represent time values, but it is unfortunately few if any applications use it.  </s>
<s> However, I suspect that the format you are thinking of is the one in ISO 8601.  </s>
<s> The forms it allows are YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ and YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS (the latter is in local time.  </s>
<s> This format is used by the VCalendar specification (currently being considered by IETF Calendaring WG), for example.  </s>
<s> I think having either local values or GMT values is kinda strange, but there you go.  </s>
<s> In any case, by restricting yourself to either GMT times or else to local time you actually do end up with strings you can compare lexically.  </s>
<s> Needless to say, use of local time is inherently ambiguous and hence not acceptable, but using GMT always would work and get you what you want.  </s>
<s> However, I question the need for any of this.  </s>
<s> While it is true that the formats we tend to use for date/time values cannot be compared directly, I remain to be convinced that this gives enough of a performance gain to warrant changing things.  </s>
