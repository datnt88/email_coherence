Technique 6.1.A - User notification of style sheet use. 
In suggested language, we need to acknowledge that Checkpoint 6.1 and Checkpoint 3.3 are mutually exclusive: one or the other will always be triggered. 
I propose that if 3.3 (Check document for use of style sheets) is triggered and fixed, then 6.1 should be triggered. 
Thus the following would occur: 1. the document does not use style sheets (3.3 triggered) 2. user adds style sheets 3. 6.1 triggered to verify that the style sheets transform gracefully However, if style sheets are identified, then 3.3 is not triggered but 6.1 is. 
I propose rewording 3.3 as: Technique 3.3.A 
[priority 2] Check document for use of style sheets. 
Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: Check document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document. 
Example Language: Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. 
For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element to control font styles Repair Technique: Notify the user if the document does not use style sheets. 
Once the user has added style sheets, trigger technique 6.1 to verify that the document is readable when style sheets are not applied. 
I don't believe a link to 3.3 is need from 6.1. 
I propose that 6.1 says, Technique 6.1.A [priority 1] Verify that the document is readable when style sheets are not applied. 
Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: Triggers: -LINK element with a REL attribute set to 'stylesheet,' -STYLE element, -At least one "style" attribute used on any element. 
Example Language: Ensure this document can be read without stylesheets. 
Repair Technique: none Test Files and Discussion Files: wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa This brings up a WCAG question. 
WCAG says Obviously, one shouldn't use FONT in place of structural Markup like, e.g., H1. 
But what accessibility problems are there using FONT in addition to structure, for example, This use of font is invisible to text based systems like Lynx. 
Netscape, Internet explorer, and Opera all have settings to disable fonts... at least the current versions. 
Perhaps some older versions don't have this... 
I don't know... but that at most would make it a priority 3. Is there some other consideration I'm not thinking of?

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) I believe this is mostly philosophical, but also has something to do with how easy it is for the user to override author settings. 
do all browsers allow users to override FONT settings? 
I thought there was an issue with font size=x and people not being able to resize text. 
--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa If there is an issue with browsers not letting users override font, then this is one of the "until browsers to x" issue and should be moved to there. 
If it's philosophical: I'm gonna be a radical here and suggest that we not push for anything which is just philosophical. 
We should only push for things that have actual impact on how easy it is for a person with a disability to use the web. 
We can leave it to other W3C groups to push philosophy, I think. 
When I face of roomful of webmasters, I've got enough of a job convincing them to give up PDF, which has real impact, without spending any time defending philosophy. 
I hope that doesn't sound too harsh. 
Anyway, this is a WCAG issue and I'm going to send it over there.
