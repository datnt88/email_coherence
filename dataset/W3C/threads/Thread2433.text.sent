Could the spec allow for customization of the authentication dialog? 
Just wondering, -e The only customization allowed for is the value of the realm, which should be displayed to the user (if any) if challenging for the credentials. 
In thinking about customizing this, bear in mind that some clients will not be browsers and will not have human users. 
FWIW, ages ago I asked for (and was denied) the addition of a "prompt" attribute, which would have been (one of) the thing the user saw in the dialog box. 
The argument against at the time was, I think, that such an attribute could be used by a malicious server to fool the user into giving credentials for a spoofed authentication domain. 
Notwithstanding that valid criticism, I still think a "prompt" attribute could be useful. 
In one application I wrote, users have to register before they can gain access to "protected" documents. 
The project, and hence the realm, is "SEPTEMBER". 
But to remind users that they have to register first, I had to make the HTTP realm attribute be "SEPTEMBER (You must have registered)", so browsers would present that string, and users would get the useful hint. 
Dave Kristol I agree, I think quite a few web applications end up doing their own authentication simply because the default prompt is unfriendly. 
Specification of a prompt doesn't need to mean replacement of the existing prompt. 
Perhaps rather than prompt, what could be specified would be a comment to be included in the login dialog box. 
By calling it a comment (or realm description) and requiring continued presentation of the server name and realm I think there is no valid criticism. 
Since the REALM still governs the process, non-human clients would have no conflict. 
It would also be very useful if user agents would allow the user to review the body associated with the 401 response WITHOUT canceling the authentication prompt. 
In any case, this seems well out of bounds for what we can consider for HTTP/1.1 ... or does the apparent undocking of authentication leave more wiggle room?
