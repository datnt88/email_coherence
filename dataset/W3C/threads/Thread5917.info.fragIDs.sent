<s> I propose the following requirements be added to the requirements document: The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide mechanisms to enable a choreography to specify that a process in a particular role MUST send zero, one or more messages from a statically defined set of messages in parallel, serial or any combination of the two.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST be able to describe decision points where a process in a particular role MAY send zero, one or more messages from a statically defined set of messages in parallel, serial or any combination of the two.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST be able to describe who is to receive a message by referencing their role.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST make it possible to specify a role's binding to an actual web service instance either statically, when a web service using that choreography is deployed, or dynamically at run time.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide mechanisms to allow messages to be sent to a particular member of a set of web services in the same role.  </s>
<s> [Ed Note: What I'm very inelegantly trying to capture is the idea that if you are running an auction service and you just found out that one of the bidders isn't qualified to bid you need a way to say things like "I'm now going to send out an unsolicited 'get lost you dead beat' message to one web service that is in the role of bidder."  </s>
<s> This could then trigger a whole set of messages back and forth between the auction service and the dead beat bidder, the choreography needs some way to capture the fact that you are still talking to the same member of the role group.]  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST NOT require that the logic used by a sender in a decision point to decide how to act be exposed in the choreography.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST enable the annotation of all actions with human readable descriptions.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide an abstract mechanism where by the logic used to make a decision at a decision point can be expressed through reference to a WSBPEL abstract or executable process or similar machine readable logic.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format base specification MUST NOT specify bindings for the abstract mechanism used to reference machine readable logic, rather extension specifications on top of the base specification MUST be used.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate it if objections to these requirements were stated in the form of alternate proposals.  </s>
<s> It's easy to say why something is wrong, it's a lot harder to spend the time to specify what is right.  </s>

<s> JJ The choreography instance id problem is one that was also discussed by ebXML.  </s>
<s> The issues, as you say were: 1.  </s>
<s> The need to have an identifier shared between the roles (ebXML called them parties) in the choreography so that, when a message arrives, or is sent, the correct context could be set by the sender and identified by the recipient.  </s>
<s> 2. The problem that the an identifier created by the sender may not serve as a useful identifier at the recipient as their system separately controls the identifier used by correlation.  </s>
<s> I recall that there were several different approaches to solving this considered, including: 1.  </s>
<s> Each role setting their own choreography instance id 2. The sender of the first message setting the choreography instance id 3. Concatenating a sender and receivers choreography instance ids to give a unique, shared id.  </s>
<s> However, the ended up choosing the second and recognizing that it would mean that, for some implementations, mapping tables between the "public" and private id's might be needed.  </s>
<s> David  </s>
<s> Public' Typically, what you will have is an architecture where the "choreography interface", i.e. the component in charge of sending and receiving messages is interacting with a process engine (e.g. possibly based on BPEL) which would dispatch these messages to the correct application.  </s>
<s> Typically, the process engine will deal with this correlation as you probably don't want to propagate the choreography 'IDs" into the applications and force the application to understand how a choreography works and what is a choreography instance.  </s>
<s> What I think we agree on, is that we don't want to expose correlation to the level of choreography definition since it does not need to be part of the "shared knowledge".  </s>
<s> It can be actually quite confusing in a MCP as each party could have its way to "correlate" a message to a choreography instance.  </s>
<s> JJ- -----Original Message----- Public' JJ I agree with you that correlation is not a topic we have discussed.  </s>
<s> I, like you prefer a choreography instance id as it simplifies the choreography definition and is indpendent of the detail of the message content.  </s>
<s> However it does mean that there can then be inconsistencies between the choreography instance id and some id inside the message content e.g. an order no.  </s>
<s> David -----Original Message----- "The WS-Chor choreography definition MUST provide mechanisms by which the execution of one choreography definition is dependent on the execution of the instance of some other choreography definition".  </s>
<s> The use case for this is where you want to execute a choreography that determines the current state of processing of some earlier choreography.  </s>
<s> The "query" choreography can only validly be executed if there is some earlier instance of the a choreography that can be referenced.  </s>
<s> [JJ] I would treat the "query/admin" problem as an independent problem like you seem to suggest in the following points.  </s>
<s> However, I can see the advantages of your proposal above in Multi-party-collaborations.  </s>
<s> This will save us from complex correlation schemes.  </s>
<s> This is another area of requirements that I think we did not touch: correlation.  </s>
<s> There are two possible approaches: an explicit correlation mechanism based on the document contents, and a choreography protocol which envelope contains a choreography instance ID.  </s>
<s> I personally favor the choreography protocol as it works in all cases and simplifies the choreography definition.  </s>
<s> The following couple of requirements are ones that have been discussed much earlier on the list however I am not sure that we really want to do them, at least not initially, but I do think they are worth discussing ... "The WS Choreography specification MUST provide standardized, reusable choreography definitions that allow one role to determine another roles state of processing of a choreography instance, no matter what choreography definition was being followed."  </s>
<s> "The WS Choreography specification MUST provide standardized, reusable choreography definitions that allow one role to request another role to restart the processing of a "stalled" choreography instance, no matter what choreography definition was being followed."  </s>
<s> This could simply be a request to resend some earlier message that got lost.  </s>
<s> The rationale for both of these is that querying the status of a choreography and re-starting a choreography will be common requirements for many (but not all) choreographies and therefore having a standard way of doing these functions will make choreographies easier to design and develop.  </s>
<s> As stated earlier, more comments inline below.  </s>
<s> David -----Original Message----- I propose the following requirements be added to the requirements document: The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide mechanisms to enable a choreography to specify that a process in a particular role MUST send zero, one or more messages from a statically defined set of messages in parallel, serial or any combination of the two.  </s>
<s> DB A couple of comments: 1.  </s>
<s> I think a role that MUST send zero messages doesn't work as if the role MUST send zero messages, then why is it in the choreography.  </s>
<s> 2. Why do you use the term "description format" instead of the simpler "definition' because, aren't the properties you seek a characteristic of the definition rather than the format of the definition.  </s>
<s> 3. The first sentence is circular as it says ... "The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST enable a choreography ..." without specifying what a choreography is.  </s>
<s> 4. I think you mean when you say a "statically defined set of messages" that the actual messages definitions that can be sent are finite in number and from a proscribed list.  </s>
<s> There has been a lot of discussion on the idea of variability in the detailed message content which means that limiting a choreography to specific message formats will inhibit choreography reuse.  </s>
<s> Instead I thinkt that we should refer to "Message Types" or "Message Families" rather than "messages".  </s>
<s> 5. This requirement is also very similar to the next so my alternative is described below The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST be able to describe decision points where a process in a particular role MAY send zero, one or more messages from a statically defined set of messages in parallel, serial or any combination of the two.  </s>
<s> DB So how about the following requirement that combines the previous two and takes into account the comments I made ... "The WS-Chor choreography definition MUST provide mechanisms that define the sequence in which one or more messages types are exchanged between two or more roles either in parallel, serially or any combination of the two, together with the conditions that cause those messages to be sent." /DB The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST be able to describe who is to receive a message by referencing their role.  </s>
<s> DB I would add the sender to this definition to give ... "The WS Choreography definition MUST be able to describe who the sender of a message is and who the receiver should be by referencing their role."  </s>
<s> The rationale for this is that what you do with a message may well depend on the role of the sender ... assuming that the same message can be sent by different roles.  </s>
<s> /DB The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST make it possible to specify a role's binding to an actual web service instance either statically, when a web service using that choreography is deployed, or dynamically at run time.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide mechanisms to allow messages to be sent to a particular member of a set of web services in the same role.  </s>
<s> [Ed Note: What I'm very inelegantly trying to capture is the idea that if you are running an auction service and you just found out that one of the bidders isn't qualified to bid you need a way to say things like "I'm now going to send out an unsolicited 'get lost you dead beat' message to one web service that is in the role of bidder."  </s>
<s> This could then trigger a whole set of messages back and forth between the auction service and the dead beat bidder, the choreography needs some way to capture the fact that you are still talking to the same member of the role group.]  </s>
<s> DB This example introduces the idea of a role group, which I don't *think* we need.  </s>
<s> If we take this use case, then you can actually consider it as an internal "business process" problem, for example: The auctioneer has a business process that consists of a set of separate individual identical choreographies between the auctioneer and the bidder where each choreography instance would take the following form ... AUCTIONEER BIDDER Bid Invite ------- Either ... Get Lost --------- ... or ... --------------- Bid ... etc ... The fact that there are several bidders involved is something that only the auctioneer needs to be concerned of.  </s>
<s> This means that this is really a business process (e.g. BPEL ) problem rather than a choreography problem especially as the auctioneer is in complete control of what goes on.  </s>
<s> For example, the auctioneer could treat all the interactions as being part of one choreography by using the same identifier for the correlation of all the messages irrespective of the bidder.  </s>
<s> Now there may be a use case where you really do the need the variability, but I can't think of one.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if we can avoid this variability, then it will simplify the specification we need to write significantly.  </s>
<s> The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST NOT require that the logic used by a sender in a decision point to decide how to act be exposed in the choreography.  </s>
<s> DB There's a corollary, I think, that says something like ... "The WS-Chor choreography definition MUST enable the results of decisions made by one role that affect the behavior of another role to be communicated to the other role."  </s>
<s> This is really about the transmission of relevant state information between roles.  </s>
<s> /DB The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST enable the annotation of all actions with human readable descriptions.  </s>
<s> DB I agree but would go further and replace the last phrase with "... with clear semantic definitions."  </s>
<s> Something might be human readable but that does not mean it explains the purpose well.  </s>
<s> /DB The WS-Chor choreography description format MUST provide an abstract mechanism where by the logic used to make a decision at a decision point can be expressed through reference to a WSBPEL abstract or executable process or similar machine readable logic.  </s>
<s> DB I don't have an alternative definition, but this pre-supposes a binding to WSBPEL that we might (or might not) want to make unless and until we collectively (i.e. WSBPEL and WSCHOR) work out what the goals and relationships of each activity will be.  </s>
<s> /DB The WS-Chor choreography description format base specification MUST NOT specify bindings for the abstract mechanism used to reference machine readable logic, rather extension specifications on top of the base specification MUST be used.  </s>
<s> DB As a general comment, we could do with developing definitions of various terms, e.g. "decision point", "base specification" which although quite intuitive, could be open to miss-interpretation. /DB I would appreciate it if objections to these requirements were stated in the form of alternate proposals.  </s>

<s> 3. A process that participates in two choreographies needs two different identifiers correlated to its instance (or N correlations for N choreographies)  </s>
<s> What about the possibility that each participant just picks its own identifier and all participants communicating with it agree to use that identifier to maintain the notion of a session?  </s>
<s> If you have n participants than you have n different identifiers.  </s>
<s> You can talk to a participant only if you know its identifier (which is opaque - means nothing to you), so you can't join the choreography unless invited to join it.  </s>
<s> Would a scheme like that work?  </s>
