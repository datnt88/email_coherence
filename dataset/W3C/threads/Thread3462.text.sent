Suggestions for points to address in the guidelines on Ojects, Images, and Applets: a.. How an object (such as an applet) should determine it's runtime locale. 
In many (most?) cases, it makes sense to rely on the default/system locale. 
Are there cases where that's not appropriate? 
b.. Are there any known issues with mixing charsets (parent charset != child charset) when embedding HTML objects?

kiosks, internet cafes, anyplace where someone can use an "open" machine or a machine that is not their personal machine, has the potential to be the wrong locale. 
(Separate from the guidelines discussion: There should be a way for a user to set their user agent locale independent of O/S etc. 
Perhaps in a style sheet? 
Then they can override it the same way they might override accessibility settings.

Making e-Business Work Around the World For what is the locale relevant? 
In general, it might be better to say that applet,... writers should not depend on locale-sensitive behavior. 
There may be, in particular for data passed from the parent document to the child applet. 
Ideally, such data would be passed in the platform- wide Unicode-based encoding, but it's probably not specified anywhere. 
It would be good to set up some actual examples and see if they work.

Yes. 
Kiosk machines usually come with various language buttons on the first screen. 
Their built-in browsers should do the right thing when a language is selected. 
For internet cafes, libraries, and so on, it might be a good idea to create a startup page with a few scripts that can set the configuration (don't know if that's possible, will try to check, may depend on browser).

What do you mean by 'user agent locale'? 
Is that the language of the menu items and error messages, or anything else? 
Regards, Martin. 
Sorry about the ambiguity. 
I was responding to Steve's points and meant the locale that is used to influence the rendering of pages, applets, etc. 
I don't think it some come from the O/S but from something that the user can control. 
It can be set today by making a selection in a form and/or choices of web pages as you indicated in another mail. 
That limits a user's choices to the configurations an author provides. 
So there might be an English page with date formats like d/m/y and another with m/d/y and another with y/m/d. 
But usually you are lucky to get a page with the language and forget about date, number etc. formats. 
However, if this was controlled by the user (perhaps through a style sheet) then there would be far fewer combinations an author or publisher need provide. 
You suggested in the other mail that we should recommend developers create locale-insensitive applets. 
It's good to recommend it, but it is not always achievable.
