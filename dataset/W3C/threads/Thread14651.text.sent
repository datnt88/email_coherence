I've been using the word "indexing" a lot and tying it in with RDF and trying to get something that furthers it into the guidelines. 
Whenever I get a (non-fiction) book about something I have any familiarity with I look first in the index to learn a lot almost instantly/painlessly - even before the Table of Contents. 
Occasionally I consult bibliography, seldom get deep into the notes (whether they're on the referring page or in a collection at the end), and almost always go really fast through the acknowledgements. 
All of these items (well, maybe not the footnotes) are important enough metadata (information about the content of the book) that it is extremely rare that any of them is missing. 
Edition #, copyright information, notes about the formatting/typography/+ are usually of more interest to publishing specialists. 
At any rate all of this stuff is taken for granted in books (and in fact in magazines and newspapers) so it should come as no surprise that although the Web is a completely different medium, because of the fact that it (in one of its major guises) presents not only information but information about the information, its parallels with certain forms of print media is valid. 
Without that metadata a book is very poor. 
Same for Web Content. 
Does this have to do with our scope/charter/accessibility/+? 
IMO it is absolutely central to accessibility for PWDs (Persons with disability) - as well as TABs (Temporarily able bodied). 
The ultimate "electronic curb-cut" might well be that Content on the Web, by becoming accessibile to our friends/clients, also becomes *much* more usable by everybody. 
What I am proposing is a means of enhancing/recommending/requiring/educating/+ the use of adequate indexing in all Web Content at a P1 level. 
Because Charles so timely stated "Objectivity is also a subjective concept" then the idea of a "barrier" making the Web beyond merely "difficult" to use - bordering on impossible - is clearly tenable from the POV of getting to the information strewn about on the shoulders of the infobahn. 
Before even attempting to use a Website, one must find out if it's in one's native language, whether it's accessible (and whether its claim of conformance is testable), and if there is any information about its content given,and if so, what is its nature. 
These sound like rather heavy demands at first until one examines parallel experiential histories undergone before entering into a book acquisition. 
A great many books are useless without indices and for PWDs with certain conditions they are useless without, e.g. claimed-to-be-useful illustrations, and other features that rise above merely useful to mandatory. 
The starting notion is that every element of a site ("element" in both the sense that term is used in markup languages and as used in everyday speech) must be revealed/referenceable/indexed. 
The techniques for this are very similar to the familiar ones from other media: indexing; tables of contents; "Dublin Core-like" stuff. 
The guideline is quite abstract/general though not-yet-written but why write it if we don't agree on its principle: access to Web Content requires information *about* the content to be readily available without the need to actually "buy the book".

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hmmm, I am notusre that metadata is yet at the accessibility requirement stage. 
So I will waffle briefly on the topic. 
For those uninterested, stop here grin/ There are requirements to provide access to various parts of content. 
There is not, as Kynn pointed out, an explicit requirement in WCAG to identify how accessibility is achieved, which is one area where metadata woulod be an extremely powerful technique. 
It is possible that the requirement should be there, but in many cases it can also be done simply by using markup according to specification (for example, the alt attribute on the img element is explicitly described as an alternative, as is longdesc. 
the title attribute on an abbreviation is a bit less clear from the HTML 4.0 spec...). 
Providing access to content via a site map, structured content, etc, can all be achieved by using metadata, and some of the really cool applications are things like automatic site maps, and navigation that builds links by hunting metadata from around the web. 
But this is a technique not a requirement. 
I think what will finally make the difference is implementation (in this as in so many facets of accessibility). 
If every browser for the last year had come out with a metadata parser and renderer, then it might be the only sensible way to do this. 
But in the current web, metadata-based solutions are often not sufficiently compatible with the browsers available, as far as I can tell. 
(Personally I am looking forward to the day when that is not true...) cheers Charles I've been using the word "indexing" a lot and tying it in with RDF and trying to get something that furthers it into the guidelines.

William, what type of indexing are we talking about? 
Is a simple "all words indexing" similar to that provided by search engines acceptable (e.g. searchbutton.com), 
or do you mean the type of human-generated index found at the back of books? 
Or is this a technique-level question? 
I don't agree with the P1 rating, by the way, to me it's clearly a P2, but I think this points out the problem with the extremely fuzzy distinction between "difficult" and "impossible" that separate P1 from P2. I _do_ agree that indexes, searchability, meta-content, should be a guideline/requirement.

I think good indexing is currently near to impossible (implementation-wise), but is getting closer to being difficult every day (look at UWIMP...), so it should probably end up as a P1 guideline. 
Of course, that's ignoring all of the debates about what kind of priority levels WCAG 2.0 is going to have... [FWIW: I don't think that anything like WCAG is ever going to have more than about 5 levels of priority: it's hard enough getting people to agree on three...but I unnecessarily digress] I think that WL's "indexing" notion is roughly analogous to adding simple content defining metadata as envisaged by the inclusion of the meta elements in HTML, but allowing extension to include upcoming data models (RDF etc.). 
Dublin Core is a good link, as it is a one dimensional form of RDF metadata: comparable to a recasting of what one can achieve with the meta elements into RDF. 
(and one can trasform the said meta elements into Dublin Core; references available upon request). 
I loved your "Amanda" example:- As she clicks on the link, her browser queries the travel site, requesting a self-reported WAI conformance claim (which is stored via RDF in a file on a standard place on the server, e.g. /wcag.rdf in the root directory). 
This is an excellent example of what tomorrows Web could/should be like [N.B. How many people are gonna be spending time writing up WAI conformance claims by hand? 
None: so one for ERT to cover.], and clearly shows a WAI aim. 
If servers could be made to automatically generate, store, and update a conformance claim(s) (EDL?) that is queryable by a browser, it should increase accessibility enourmously. 
I'm pretty sure that indexing and general metadata related checkpoint(s) should be explicitly defined in WCAG 2.0... Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer "Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics." 
- Homer J. Simpson, BABF07. 
Do you believe it should be a P1 because it is important and good, or because it strictly follows the definition of priority 1 in WCAG 1.0, which means that certain identifiable groups of people with disabilities will be _absolutely unable_ to access content if it is not indexed but otherwise follows all other WCAG standards for accessibility? 
I think we need to be careful to distinguish things which we believe _must_ be done from things which fit the definition of priority 1 (however we define that -- currently it's defined in WCAG 1.0). 
For example, using valid markup is P2 and using illustrations is P3; but I believe Sean and Anne (respectively) could argue that those are essential for access -- but not necessarily P1 as we have narrowly defined it. 
To me, this illustrates a weakness in the P1/P2/P3 system; there are some things which I believe _must_ be done but which are not P1 items -- the solution is not to redefine them as P1 by ignoring our own fuzzy definition, but instead to create a firmer definition of what P1 means. 
P1 _should_ correspond with, in my opinion, "we think these are the most important things that you should make highest priority", but at present that is not the case, by definition.

While a lot of good points have been made here, I have an uncomfortable feeling that we may be going to far. 
That is, stepping beyond accessibility into 'good design'. 
Although it is certainly true that the two are tightly linked, I feel we need to draw a line somewhere or we might as well be developing 'web design guidelines' instead of accessibility guidelines. 
In my usual, relate it to the physical world - The ADA tells you to put up signs indicating the location of a handicap access to a building, it does not tell you to put up a sign with your company name and a description of what it does. 
How a company (web site) chooses to identify and describe itself would seem to be a 'good business practice' issue not an accessibility issue. 
Marti Kynn, Following the current definition of the prioritites, including illustrations should be a priority 1 issue, based strictly on the numbers of people served. 
I'm unsure where metadata should be. 
Certainly it would be easier to "test" for priority one items by metadata, so it would be helpful, and perhaps make the difference between people with speciial needs finding sites they can use, or not. 
Perhaps the distinction needs to be between supported and unsupported meta data. 
The supported stuff should be priority 1, and the stuff where we're hoping for future inclusion in priority 2 or 3 (since it actually makes no difference to most/any users now). 
Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation Don't be too sure about that until you've "walked in their shoes" a bunch. 
Most of my experience with "disability issues" had (historically) to do with DRM (Disability Rights Movement) activism and the general "world of the blind". 
However, now I am in (or at least rapidly entering) one of the "conditions of disability" myself and as I age/deteriorate/wisen/mellow/dizzify/+ I find that one of the major things that makes the Web difficult/frustrating/opaque/off-putting/+ is the almost complete absence of an index to it. 
I'm on here so in a sense it's not "impossible" - but my senility hasn't moved from "creeping" to "blossoming" just yet. 
One way to look at it is whether indexing would make it possible to use the Web for people with certain conditions rather than whether absence of indexing makes it impossible. 
It is because of this POV that I opted to propose P1 for this matter. 
Like those of us who say "why don't they just learn to read?" about some group, we may be in danger of failing to be sufficiently cognizant of the fact that metadata is fully as important as the data about which it *is*. 
Using "word search" engines to locate anything, let alone collate stuff is a craft/art/skill/+ reserved not for those with training in computer science but in "data search" methods. 
So - are old folks to be denied access to this incredible resource because its parts are scattered randomly throughout cyberspace? 
I hope not and am doing what little I can to use the WAI "tail" to wag the W3C "dog" to force immediate recommendations/standards/guidelines/+ to implement prolific indexing of the elements of the Web, which *should* be a major step in getting the entire thing *accessible* to those who are or will become beset with the aging process - in fact, as Gregg is fond of saying "by the way, how are you feeling now that you're getting older?" 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE prolific indexing of the elements of the Web, which *should* be a major step in getting the entire thing *accessible* to those who are or will become beset with the aging process Let's consider the original example that Marti gave: a billboard for a company. 
"The ADA tells you to put up signs indicating the location of a handicap access to a building, it does not tell you to put up a sign with your company name and a description of what it does." 
But what if you were cognitevely disabled or didn't recognize the makers of the sign etc.? Indexing and describing things is an integral part of accessibility: why would I even *want* to access something if I didn't know what it was? 
Indexing and metadata (data about data, i.e. descriptive data) the way that the WAI will (surely) be approaching it will also include metadata about how accessible a site/URI is; look at Kynn's excellent example for further explanation of that. 
So, William, what is it really like to get old? 
I feel that we often forget to include "age" as a disability (too young or too old), in much the same way as Ann steers us in the direction of cognitive disabilities. 
We are focused on"accessibility for all disabled people", and really I think that's everyone... Happy holidays everyone! 
I suppose it may already be Christmas Day in some parts of the world... (it's 7:22PM GMT). 
'Tis the season to be jolly :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer "Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics." 
- Homer J. Simpson, BABF07. 
It's great! 
I hope everyone gets here. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I think we need to be careful about the terminology here; age (old or young) is not a disability, it's merely a state of being. 
Disabilities are a state of being as well, but are a specific subset. 
The arguments for "increased accessibility for people with disabilities" are weakened whenever we adopt a well-meaning principle that makes most people effectively "disabled." 
For example, if I claimed I was "disabled" because I am about 30 lbs overweight, or because I need glasses to see, or because I never learned how to play the piano, then the definition of disability loses its meaning and power. 
While that may seem like a good thing -- realizing that we all have varying abilities -- it also serves to engender skepticism in many people who will look at the so-called "disability" and then conclude that most anyone claiming a disability may have as weak a claim as mine. 
This has been seen before, in the US, when dealing with people who need public support to avoid starving. 
Because there are visible, but rare, cases of welfare abuse, many people have decided that welfare itself is wrong because all it does is help lazy cheats who want a free ride -- even though the majority of people on the public dole are honest people who simply lack money or the ability to earn it. 
Now, that's not to say that age isn't a condition we should concern ourselves with -- at Edapta, we consider aged users to be a primary target demographic for our edaptations -- but to declare that the state of being aged is inherently a disability will just confuse the issue. 
Especially as there are a number of age-related changes which are not "disabling" at all, but rather just simply -differences- (such as cognitive changes related to age) -- and especially as the specific effects of age will vary by person. 
When someone becomes disabled -- due to age or otherwise -- then clearly they fall into the realm of someone with a disability! 
Anyway, back to guidelines... --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com/

....if I claimed I was "disabled" because I am about 30 lbs overweight, or because I need glasses to see, or because I never learned how to play the piano, then the definition of disability loses its meaning and power." 
Only if by so claiming you are creating that "definition". 
The things you cite don't qualify either with a formal definition or a common-sense one. 
OTOH aging is so closely associated with almost inevitable "ability decrements" that it really does qualify. 
E.g. my urologist says "if you get to be 90, you WILL have prostate cancer" although there may be some nonagenarian out there who didn't. 
I still read perfectly well without glasses but I need more light on the page. 
That latter is analogous to accessing via indices, etc. 
I "used to could" find items with word searches, now I can't. 
I didn't get lazy (in fact I'm working longer/harder than at almost any time in my life), I lost a certain ability - hence the term "disability". 
There is a detailed version of this inevitability fairly deep into "Changes in people's functional ability due to aging can include subtle and/or gradual changes in abilities or a combination of abilities including vision, hearing, dexterity and memory. 
Barriers can include any of the issues already mentioned above. 
Any one of these limitations can affect an individual's ability to access Web content. 
Together, these changes can become more complex to accommodate." 
So if I claim I'm "disabled" because I'm quite senior, take it as a non-frivolous item. 
Not just because of the 3/4 century but the inevitable accompaniment. 
You'll see! 
Love.

Unofficial Section 508 Checklist http://kynn.com/+section508 
This is exactly the kind of thing that concerns me about making 'indexing' an accessibility issue. 
This is an issue which should be of concern to all. 
By taking up an issue as broad as 'indexing' we risk credibility. 
Marti I think you're right, to some extent, but I think this is why we need to justify our checkpoints and guidelines as explicitly overcoming existing barriers for identifiable groups of users with disabilities. 
A general statement of "indexing is good" is true, and a statement of "indexing is good for everyone" is true, and therefore a statement of "indexing is good for any given subgroup of everyone " is true -- "indexing is good for baseball fans", for example. 
However, it is incumbent upon us to identify how exactly indexing provides additional benefits beyond those imparted to a general audience, for an identifiable user group with one or more disabilities. 
"Indexing is good for people with disabilities" is quite obviously true, just as "...for baseball fans" is true. 
But for indexing to be an accessibility feature, we need to do a little more work and tell _how_ it benefits someone with a disability. 
For example, "indexing is of benefit to people with certain disabilities for whom navigation schemes may prove unwieldy, even if the navigation system is designed well". 
Indexing could be thought of as an alternate navigation scheme which allows blind users (for example) to bypass navigation-by-hierarchy (as with Yahoo) and jump directly to information. 
As Marti has pointed out, this can be iffy -- which is why I think we might even need better examples or justification than I can provide. 
There is a danger in making too broad of guidelines; in making "do good web design" guidelines instead of accessibility guidelines. 
People will come to the web accessibility initiative looking for accessibility guidelines; they need a definitive and accurate source. 
If we make this too broad, then we lose much of our authority and the strength inherent in our guidelines -- and most importantly, we may lose sight of the human aspect of accessibility. 
As much as it is important for there to be someone or some group advocating "good web design", it's even more important that people with disabilities have _their_ voice. 
There is a danger in becoming so generic that those unique voices get lost in the crowd, as we (WAI) are one of the few organizations who can speak for/as them on technical issues of web design. 
We need to take care not to dilute those voices.

Other guidelines (clear writing, for instance) are "of concern to all".. Indexing is an accessibility issue because its absence makes the Web relatively inaccessible to a reasonably well-defined group. 
If it helps others, fine. 
If clear writing and illustrations help other than people with cognitive disabilities, fine. 
If audio descriptions allows my wife to "watch" soaps without looking at the screen that doesn't make it any less of an accessibility issue. 
If we must parse "potential backlash" then count me out. 
The idea that taking up *any* issue threatens our credibility threatens my credibility.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE In a certain sense "inclusion" carries a certain "dilution". 
To put it another way, we need inclusion more than we need "poster children". 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Should we change our focus and make it "correct web design which can be used by all people"? 
Should we still be concerned primarily with people with disabilities? 
Or should we simply publish "web design the W3C way" as part of a semantic web effort? 
Is it important to even talk about those "poster children"? 
Would our guidelines on "how to do the web" be better if we didn't mention cripples at all? 
Maybe we could be more "inclusive" if we didn't even concern ourselves with people with disabilities. 
See, I have a definite opinion here that we _do_ need "poster children" if that means "not forgetting the human aspect of web accessibility", and I would gladly sacrifice "inclusion" if that means we have a stronger document that speaks up with voices that are not often heard.

Marti, I share your concerns about going into "good design" instead of remaining within accessibility, so it is important that the metadata that we ask authors to include on their pages, be limited to that metadata which will be used by human disabled users. 
Comparing metadata to signs is a good example. 
It isn't enough to merely "reserve" parking for the handicapped, but ya gotta put signs (and reminders of fines for misuse) before you have fulfilled the law, so the handicapped drivers can find 'em. 
Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation randomly the The metaphor I see here isn't about a dog and a tail, but more of a cart and a horse. 
There are no tools. 
There are no relevant final W3C Recommendations that I'm aware of. 
Almost nobody is prepared technically or otherwise to index legacy content, particularly non-technical web designers. 
What about people who hand-code? 
I'm aware of one ADA Technical Assistance Center that does so. 
They have megabytes of existing content. 
They can't afford indexing tools to produce RDF or whatever format is specified (does one even exist yet?), much less person-hours to retrofit the content they already have out there in plain old HTML. 
They don't speak XML, and throwing this requirement over to ATAG doesn't do any good, since the center's not going to be using any of their products. 
And their web hosting is outsourced, so any tool to do this kind of thing automatically on the server might not be implemented. 
By making this a P1, this group that's chartered to support others in making things accessible to PWDs can't even claim single-A compliance! 
I see the value of indexing, particularly as relates to cognitive disabilities. 
But it is no less of an "art" than search. 
What's more, I can think of some web content that would not stand up to an indexing effort, due to the methods in which it's stored, gathered, presented, or referenced. 
This, like the SVG issue, may be appropriate years from now, when the tools to do it are in easy reach, but that time is not now, or even close at hand. 
Nothing the W3C can do "immediately" will change that between now and the time WCAG 2 becomes a Recommendation. 
I can't think of this as higher than a P3. 
The level of effort involved to do this on any large site, even if this proposed guideline were spectacularly delineated for the designer, is enough to make most of those who are interested in making their sites accessible turn away. 
I hate to play pragmatist to this crowd, but an overly ambitious standard simply won't gain traction. 
As these guidelines approach the more labor-intensive and stringent, fewer organizations, corporations, governmental bodies, etc., will adopt them, fewer sites will be made accessible, and the end result is that less content, not more, will be made truly accessible. 
Matt May Webvan Group Yes there are. 
Yes there are. 
And the way to become "prepared" is to prepare. 
It's an educational process but it must begin somewhere, sometime. 
I'm suggesting here and now for those items. 
People who hand code (like me) won't have any trouble and I've already made it a part of my routine. 
The "requirements" will be trivially doable.

They can't afford indexing tools to produce RDF Sorry, missed that. 
RDF is easy to generate, and/or extract from HTML, but it's best use comes in describing "pure" XML. 
As I see more and more XML applications and langauges being banded about, they invariably don't have decent metadata frameworks included with them (even XHTML is inadequate with its meta elements). 
RDF provides that framework for anyone wanting to add indexing to their pages. 
As for a lack of tools, have a look at Dave Beckett's site: http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf/resources 
It may be that such indexing is provided for accessibility tools of the future that read accessibility claims written in EDL etc. 
The future, as always, is very hard to predict, but it is us who shape it... Happy holidays, Sean B. Palmer "Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."

I'd need to see the requirements, naturally, to agree with you. 
If all you're trying to do is get WCAG compliance data in a single RDF document on the server, then I apologize for misunderstanding you. 
I'm afraid I read ahead a few years too far in the RDF history into where metadata is being read and processed by intelligent agent technologies to find data for the user as "indexing". 
(The word "indexing" cross-references "Index Server" in my head, which is a big mismatch.) Clearly, the time for that is not now, but I can't see a problem with requiring one standalone RDF document for compliance checking, title/author/description (though the "description" field, in the future as today, is bound to be exploited and of diminished value...), and/or site mapping as a P1. 
I may have issues with embedded meta tags in HTML documents, however. 
Again, sorry for the confusion. 
matt While I fully support this notion as a technique (obviously, else I would be working on UWIMP etc.), I think that it would be hard/inadviasable to outline implementation details in the WCAG guidelines (especailly as one of the key tenets of WCAG is technology independance). 
It would be best to say something about adding indexing according to technological contraints, and then adding a fuller eplanation to an XHTML/RDF Techniquies document. 
Could you possibly iterate these issues (if you believe they'll be of benefit to the list)?

of say If the guideline were to say, "use indexing technologies to (foo)", I think that, at least, the techniques document would have to say "by indexing technologies, we mean RDF, done like this," until something better comes along. 
The technology independence plank, I believe, is to allow for entropy in data. 
Entropy in metadata is a whole other ball of wax, potentially preventing the proposed guideline from achieving its desired effect, and if we don't say what we mean here, that's what we'll get. 
I can think of two offhand: - Labor-intensive for users with legacy content. 
I'd prefer that user agents that need or desire WCAG compliance metadata look for it in a certain place (e.g., ./wcag.xml), and designers can override it if they like with a link . 
(A perhaps welcome side-effect here is that non-compliant content providers will begin to see how many users they have with assistive technologies, simply by tracking 404s.) engines. 
The contents of the average meta description tag are questionable because many content providers exploit them for best results in the engines, not for accurately describing the data within.
