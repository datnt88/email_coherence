Below are links to information that I found regarding researh specifics. 
"Technology Problems and Solutions" "Web pages divided into segments or frames can confuse software programs that translate text to voice. 
Graphics that have not been labeled with text will be read only as "image" by the software reading the text on the screen and will deprive students of valuable content. 
Web pages with a long list of hyperlinks crowded together can confuse a student with visual, cognitive, or motor disabilities." 
Also, scan down to "Pedagogy Challenges for Students with Learning Disabilities". 
Interesting point made in this article: Do not underline text. 
Scan down to "Cognitive and neurological disabilities" An excellent series: Not as many as how to write correctly, but I'm sure this will help everyone. 
Sincerely, Lee Roberts President/CEO Rose Rock Design, Inc. Building web sites accessible by EVERYONE If you are reviewing this material for the working group, could you tell us how these differ from the research quoted till now. 
Unfortunately all member of the group are unlikely to find the time to review all the different links. 
Yeah, an executive summary could be useful. 
I mean that as a request, not as a technique BTW.

I should have added a summary to this. 
Unfortunately, I did not and was not able to get back to it yesterday. 
I'm including the links again, but this time I'm adding a summary of the information. 
Most of the research that I was able to find led to four findings. 
1) Pages should be short (however, most of those pages were at least 3 - 4 pages printed) 2) The information should be in short, digestible chunks - short paragraphs, short sentences. 
3) The information should be presented in an easily scannable manner and the headings should show levels of content heirarchy. 
4) One thought per paragraph and sentence; no complex sentence structure. 
One other thing was unique enough to point out. 
The article at cognitively challenged. 
It explains what groups fall into this category. 
I can imagine a web site would be fraught with difficulty if all the pages were set up in the manner the top of the page was set up. 
After reviewing Lisa's list again, it fills all the requirements mentioned in all the research I was able to locate. 
I could not find any research that specifically disclosed how individuals with cognitive difficulties used the Internet. 
Some unique information did arise that explained that there are individuals with cognitive difficulties working in the scientific and mathematical fields. 
Those individuals would be trained to use information written to the content of scientific and mathematical fields. 
Therefore, one can not assume that the lowest common denominator be singled out when writing content. 
It does follow that the information must be presented using the information that I provided about how to write and follow Lisa's suggestions of presentation. 
Lowering the content to the lowest common denominator on all the pages ONLY, removes the credibility of the piece. 
My suggestion is to add an alternate set of pages that the cognitively challenged individuals can use. 
If this is done by a highly visited site and the server records could be examined it may show how many people with cognitive difficulties access those pages. 
However, it may even show how many people are curious enough to visit the information in that section. 
We can conservatively show that those page views beyond the first page in the series were used by those with cognitive difficulties. 
It would be a good research project for a college or research center focusing upon cognitive studies. 
Perhaps I gave Trace or MIT something they could work on.

Sincerely, Lee Roberts President/CEO Rose Rock Design, Inc. Building web sites accessible by EVERYONE Yes -- this is part of the reason that alternate versions make a lot of sense when you're talking about the variety of cognitive disabilities. 
What works for one person may be hell for another, and the only way around that is to have parallel presentations available. 
This is why we need to dispel the notion that alternate versions are "text-only pages for blind users" -- in truth, the blind users are well-served by a generally accessible page with straight-forward layout. 
The real benefits of parallel versions can be seen when we talk about _other_ (non-blind) groups of disabled users.
