<s> Hello, Let's chat at the usual time and place: 17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday Server: irc.w3.org Port: 6665 Channel: #er I've been working on a spec.  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/  </s>
<s> I've been generating it from the schema (xml rdf format).  </s>
<s> Here's the XSLT (kind of ugly, but fun): http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/earl-spec.xsl  </s>
<s> It still needs a lot of work, but I'd like to get some initial reactions (i've mostly been playing w/the XSLT instead of writing content...suggestions welcome...as well as EARL for the various user scenarios towards the end).  </s>
<s> Here's the current timeline: - publish a more polished draft before the F2F (24-26 june) - do some work on the spec at the F2F - publish a revision soon after the F2F - once we all agree on it, publish a working draft to TR and solicit wide public review (make sure to get comments from QAWG, RDF groups, etc.) - incorporate comments and publish as a Note (there is ongoing discussion about whether this will end up as a Note or be put on the Rec track) Thoughts?  </s>
<s> Reactions?  </s>
<s> Also, I've been working on an XSLT that transforms LIFT XML output to EARL.  </s>
<s> Then I hope to do another transform that combines HiSoft EARL and LIFT EARL into a checkpoint-by-checkpoint comparison of results for a particular resource (i.e.  </s>
<s> I'm evaluating a mock-site and want to compare the results that each tool gives me).  </s>
<s> What have you been up to?  </s>

<s> --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa  </s>
<s> Yep. (You give it a template to put the results into - the sample is a simple HTML output).  </s>
