<s> Here's the requirement: Mark up quotations.  </s>
<s> Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements to markup short and longer quotations, respectively.  </s>
<s> However, Q is not rendered by MSIE 5, Netscape 4.73, or Opera 3.62 (although it is rendered in Amaya 4.1 and AOLPress 2.0).  </s>
<s> Examples are shown in [1].  </s>
<s> Lynx renders Q, but it merely turns in into a quotation mark so it doesn't matter for Lynx.  </s>
<s> So if people follow this guideline then most people using visual browsers miss the quotes.  </s>
<s> If people redundantly use Q and quotation marks, then people using compliant browsers such as Amaya and AOLPress get double quotes.  </s>
<s> Either way, bad news.  </s>
<s> I suggest an erratum that omits Q from this requirement.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, say that Q is omitted till all browsers render them.  </s>
<s> Either of these is  </s>
<s> fine with me, and I hope we can settle this fast.  </s>

<s> Yes, MS and Netscape's conformance to the specifications is anemic (to be charitable).  </s>

<s> Len, you might also be interested that MSIE on the Mac DOES render Q .  </s>

<s> Netscape Gecko has the same brain-dead behavior.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> If it bugs me that much, maybe I should switch  </s>
<s> to AOLPress?  </s>
<s> The short of it is that MOST _modern_ browsers do something logical with Q ... /Q (this wasn't true when the guidelines were first  </s>

<s> As Len has pointed out, a few of P2 items (e.g., 3.1 and 5.3) are more important than the rest.  </s>
<s> It would be a shame if these were not carefully considered.  </s>

<s> My fear was there would be too much resistance and lack of buy-in.  </s>
