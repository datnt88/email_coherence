WCAG 1.0 requires Q for markup of short quotations. 
Here's the requirement: Mark up quotations. 
Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation. 
[Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements to markup short and longer quotations, respectively. 
However, Q is not rendered by MSIE 5, Netscape 4.73, or Opera 3.62 (although it is rendered in Amaya 4.1 and AOLPress 2.0). 
Examples are shown in [1]. 
Lynx renders Q, but it merely turns in into a quotation mark so it doesn't matter for Lynx. 
So if people follow this guideline then most people using visual browsers miss the quotes. 
If people redundantly use Q and quotation marks, then people using compliant browsers such as Amaya and AOLPress get double quotes. 
Either way, bad news. 
I suggest an erratum that omits Q from this requirement. 
Alternatively, say that Q is omitted till all browsers render them. 
Either of these is 
fine with me, and I hope we can settle this fast. 
It seems like a small thing, but strictly speaking it stops good pages from getting a double A rating.

I agree with Len, for the reasons he stated. 
The rest of this is 
just discussion. 
I believe this is a reason why "example" text such as that which produced this problem should be considered non-normative techniques instead of strict guidelines; if read this way, the absolute part is the guideline, before the priority notice, and the e.g. is just a suggestion. 
Even so, this isn't a good suggestion and this illustrates a point in WCAG 1.0 where the difference between guideline and example is blurred. 
Many people would read that requirement as "use Q even though it introduces problems for most people". 
Question: Has it -ever- been proven in practice that use of Q increases accessibility for people with disabilities? 
Are there current assistive technologies which recognize and use the Q tag in a meaningful way? 
--Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Emacspeak can treat it appropriately if an aural CSS property is associated with it in a style sheet. 
Some braille translation packages have basic styling mechanisms which could also benefit from it. 
Note that Q is not required. 
It is an example but it does not appear in the checklist. 
I agree that it is a bad example because it is not supported. 
Therefore, I propose that we add an Errata that changes the wording of this checkpoint to read, dd Added: 15 January 2001 dd Type: Clarification dd Refers to: Checkpoint 3.7 dd Description. 
Checkpoint 3.7 should be reworded to remove the example for Q as: 3.7 Mark up quotations. 
Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation. 
[Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the BLOCKQUOTE element to markup quotations.

Hmmm, I don't think this does it. 
Either you use the markup (and Q is part of the markup) or you don't meet the checkpoint. 
If we want to have an erratum, it should be specific: "until user agents support the q element, do not use it". 
Which of course brings us to the thorny question (yet again) of how widely something needs to be supported.

Frankly, I view this as a flaw in the specification. 
The HTML 4 spec that included q was NOT backwards compatible and thus any 
implementation will be seriously broken in one of the two ways 
that Len described. 
So we're not looking at a problem with user agents, we're looking at a problem with a poorly written spec that doesn't allow for any sort of transitional implementations. 
And that's broken.

Jason's point about Brailling quotes is good, except that Braille translation is language-dependent, so we don't need a language-independent indication for quotations here. 
The language-specific quotation marking usage will suffice. 
But I may not fully understand the interaction. 
The Q element originally came out of internationalization considerations. 
See e.g. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/1997OctDec/thread.html#26 5 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/1997OctDec/thread.html#265 
The language in the WCAG 1.0 examples, of course, just came from "do it right per the W3C Recommendation." 
The notable accessibility problem was in abuse of BLOCKQUOTE for indent, and Q just came along for the ride in the "do it right" clause. 
This shows that accessibility is not the only group who got things in HTML 4 that browsers somehow never got right. 
I believe that we could add a note in the errata document to the effect that "until user agents" trumps "use Q " under the present circumstances so that it is clear that Q is not required for AA at this time. 
I wouldn't want to go further than that with the revision of what we ask people to do without re-connecting with internationalization, because there may be things we want to do in terms of an alternate approach in XHTML 2.0 and knowing which way that is going could help us to steer where we go with WCAG 2.0.

Len, I am glad you brought this up. 
My small ego dictates that point out that I have tried to raise this issue a few times. 
The first occurrence was almost two years ago. 
Please reference URL: 
It was actually this checkpoint that made decide to settle for Single-A 
compliance. 
Kynn would be pleased to know that missing AA didn't scare me 
off most of the other P2 and P3 items. 
Wendy, I would argue that the checkpoint is fine as written. 
But then, I though 3.1 was okay too! 
Yes, MS and Netscape's conformance to the specifications is anemic (to be charitable). 
I don't think P2 and P3 items need to be watered down to accommodate unreasonable performance of the browsers. 
We spent a lot of time debating 3.1 only to agree that it meant exactly what it said. 
Yes, the errata was a minor improvement, but not so much so to make up for the time lost when we could have been working on WCAG 2.0. 
Len, you might also be interested that MSIE on the Mac DOES render Q . 
Unfortunately, it does this WRONG as it uses neutral quote marks instead of typographical (left and right) marks. 
Netscape Gecko has the same brain-dead behavior. 
Hmmm. 
If it bugs me that much, maybe I should switch 
to AOLPress? 
The short of it is that MOST _modern_ browsers do something logical with Q ... /Q (this wasn't true when the guidelines were first 
posted), so leave the checkpoint alone! 
FWIW, MSIE/Mac pop-up behavior is different too, so you may wish to note this in your ALT/TITLE page. 
Cheers, Bruce 
I am pleased, although I daresay that you (as an active member of the Web Accessibility Initiative and other such projects) are far from an average test case. 
Question to consider: If we didn't have the artificial divide of priority 1, priority 2, and priority 3 -- and instead tried to, I dunno, urge compliance based on common sense -- how many more checkpoints would there have been included in Section 508 guidelines? 
It's my estimation that a "priority 2" checkpoint means a far less greater chance of someone doing it than priority 1, and giving something a priority 3 checkpoint is pretty much a death wish for 
that checkpoint.

I think the issue with 508 incorporating more or less is not based upon common sense, rather I am of the opinion it was how much can you chew off and not overwork the people who have to implement it. 
I also think cost was an issue. 
I firmly support the 508 approach. 
Lets start small, get buy-in, educate and then next year implement more. 
Lets face it, here is a real life test case for requirements and implementation and we area part of it as well as we can listen and learn.

Dear Kynn, I won't pretend to be typical, but if memory serves, two years ago I had just joined the WAI IG list. 
True, I had been involved with disability issues before that, and I was self-motivated to do the right thing. 
Even so, Double-A was clearly too limiting, given the state of the art of browsers. 
I assumed that this was by design and not mostly accidental! 
At the time, and until relatively recently, I liked the priority scheme, and the discrete compliance levels. 
I do wonder if you are right about P2 items getting into the Section 508 rules (don't call them guidelines, they are much stronger than that). 
The advisory committee to the Access Board recommend Double A compliance as the standard. 
This recommendation was 
rejected. 
Who knows why (not me certainly), but it's fair to guess that 
Double A was obviously too tough, and the advisory committee refused to put the P2 items into any kind of hierarchy, so the Access Board just dropped down to the next "level". 
As Len has pointed out, a few of P2 items (e.g., 3.1 and 5.3) are more important than the rest. 
It would be a shame if these were not carefully considered. 
My comments on 508 were not to implement AA. 
I felt there were some areas that were vague (at the time) , open to interpretation and just not practical to implement given the development community. 
My fear was there would be too much resistance and lack of buy-in. 
This had to succeed, and taking small steps was better and to show he government was serious about it. 
I am glad to say this was the philosophy and concern that many people shared.

It would be a shame if these were not carefully considered. 
I agree to go with this "until user agents" clause qualifying requirement/example/suggestion (whatever it is) for Q for WCAG 1.0. 
As for WCAG 2.0, I suggest that absence of user agent support is another one of those external considerations (a.k.a. "considerations X") that are not accessibility per se, like security, intellectual property, or extreme difficulty. 
So in WCAG 2.0, we on the one hand say that use of Q is needed at some priority level for accessibility, but on the other hand allow it to not be used because of this external consideration. 
This would be part of the conformance criteria for which Kynn is writing requirements. 
Also, regarding the thread about 508 under this subject heading-- I suggest moving that discussion to Trace's sec508 email list [1]. 
I think it was my passing reference to 508 in my original email that started that thread and I'll be more careful in the future.

Bruce, Yes, from what you say, if you count current browser brands most do something logical. 
But if you count users, the vast majority still have software which omits quotes (e.g. MSIE 5, NN 4.73). 
So there' still a problem... just like you pointed out two years ago. 
BTW, AOLPress only does neutral quotes, not typographical right and left.

Dear All, Len and I had a short off-list conversation where I admitted that I was being a little disingenuous with my browser count. 
(And Len corrected himself about AOLpress, apparently, being the only GUI browser that renders Q .. /Q the right way.) 
Still, I would argue that the window of opportunity for making a timely amendment to Checkpoint 3.7 has passed. 
I know that this argument comes up every six months ors so, but I can't help myself! 
Part of the point of specifications is to give the browser vendors something to shoot for. 
The "until user agents" clause does nothing to promote this. 
We also regular debate when is "until" up? 
Since the latest releases of the "big two" are compliant on this particular issue, I have to argue that, at list with regard to this particular point, we have arrived! 
The formal WCAG 1.0 is now twenty months old. 
The first formal release of HTML 4 was more than 
four years ago. 
There is no excuse for the "popular" browsers being broken, 
and we should not dilute our standard to make up for their behavior -- especially when they are (finally) fixing the problem. 
By the way Len, can you name a specific site that gave up on Double-A compliance because of the problem with quotes? 
-- Bruce 
So are you saying that people should expect to be able to access the web only if they are using the most recent browser verions? 
That's really what the "until user agents" clauses are about -- backwards compatibility based on the understanding that few, if any, user agents actively follow the standards (and even fewer, historically). 
I disagree with the -phrasing- of "until user agents" (since it puts an unreasonable and inscrutable burden upon the web designer to somehow have perfect knowledge on something which even we are unable to agree upon), but I do agree with the thought behind it, which is that if you know of a common problem caused by lack of support by the browsers, it's not enough to simply say "LA LA LA NOT LISTENING WE'LL DO WHAT THE STANDARD SAYS AND THAT'S IT". 
This is why I propose replacing "until user agents" not with "it's the standard, dummy" but with concrete guidelines which say "as of 2001, there is not support for this method in the majority of browsers, so relying upon the standard will cause you problems." --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com/

Unofficial Section 508 Checklist http://kynn.com/+section508 
It is my belief that you may design for specific browsers. 
A company or agency must consider its audience especially for the intranets. 
However, if they chose to do use specific browser like American Airlines, then they better make sure they have a fantastic call center to take questions as a back-up! 
As an implementer, I detest subjective standards o I want quantitative metrics. 
There are simply too many browsers out there and there is no way to test conformance to all, so it is my belief that corporations and agencies need to make financial decision on how best to spend their funds and interact with technologies to ensure they access the widest possible audience. 
This is going to take careful planning and risks. 
But until there is a line drawn in the sand by the government or W3C where all browsers must meet the specific standards, we are going to have subjective discussions on how to make something accessible and what constitutes an accessible site. 
I, for one, am concerned that the community is its worst enemy. 
I am more than glad that we have web content accessibility guidelines, but the next step should be for the government and even challenge the us, where the WAI states here are the browser requirements. 
THEN MAKE SURE IT IS FREE for everyone. 
Then we would have both the guidelines and browsers! 
As a implementor, I would test on this one browser that people can use and also test on browsers that use my site the most. 
I am not being cynical here. 
I think this is actually doable. 
Just think if the most popular browsers and other browsers conformed to this standard. 
Then if you really want to ensure buy-in, get the Access board to back this! 
If I were a government or commercial web manager, I could state to use our site, please use the browser X - and not be so concerned with thirty browsers.

The specific question of Q aside, if/when we get consensus here, how can we turn this into a general principle that will be put into 2.0? 
And where would it fit in the way we are structuring 2.0? 
I need the answer for 1.0, but it would be good to be explicitly address 2.0 at the same time.
