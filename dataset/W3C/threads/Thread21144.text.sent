I too am having problems with the win98 binary version. 
deinstalled older version first install seemed to work and there is Amaya.exe sitting in .../bin folder and around 5 meg in size so seems ok .... but clicking on it doesn't make anything happen ... some minor packaging glitch methinks.

I tried both ways, installing over the top first, and then... Yes, agreed: 5.32MB according to my Win98... Agreed, same here using the thing directly, not via the shortcut. 
Hugh I downloaded 3 days ago installed - changed my mind and uninstalled today I installed and aamaya does not launch win98se recently updated help I too can not open amaya on win ME. it appears to install properly but when will not open at all. 
by default it installs the exe file in "C:\Program Files\Amaya\Windows\bin\amaya.exe" and its 5,453kb dave On Mon, 03 Feb 2003 13:59:17 -0500 Yes this is due to missing files in the 7.2 packages generated by InstallShield. 
New packages are now available. 
Sorry for the trouble.
