Sorry if this is OT but I've tried elsewhere and no-one can tell me the answer and I don't really want to join another W3C list for the purposes of this query. 
Can anyone tell me why form elements have to be enclosed in a p /p to validate as html 4.01 strict? 
I know that it's like that in the html spec but why? 
Why can't we just have all the elements in the form /form tags? 
At first I thought it was probably a block/inline thing but I'm not so sure now.

It is indeed. 
Form can only directly contain a block element, hence you need to have a block element that can contain inline ( p , div , td etc.) in the form and the input / or whatever inside that. 
See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd for details. 
Yes, so the fields need not be included into p elements; other block elements will do, syntactically at least. 
The principle that inline (text level) elements need to be wrapped inside block level containers (in HTML 4 Strict) is a relatively old one. 
Even the HTML 2.0 specification contained a "Strict Level 1 HTML DTD", where a body element must not directly contain inline elements. 
What does it matter? 
Well, from the accessibility point of view, it is very natural to group e.g. an input field and the associated label inside a div , especially since it's normally best that they appear on a line of their own. 
And this automatically puts them inside a block level container. 
Such constructs might be _additionally_ grouped inside enclosing div or other elements, such as fieldset . 
I'd say that normally p is not the logical markup to use inside a form except for longish explanations (instructions). 
A label/field pair is not really a paragraph, and neither is a collection of such pairs.
