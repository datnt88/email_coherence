should we tell users to get with it? 
I think not since they are using in many cases a browser whose latest itteration was just built last month. 
now, we can tell them to get that but that might not even be under their controll. 
thoughts please? 
Unfortunately, the site uses javascript to submit the form, without any alternative for non-javascript browsers. 
Try writing to them, letting them know that this is unnecessary and causing them to lose customers. 
They will need to change the site to make it accessible to lynx. 
Doug I seem to be able to access it okay with LYNX, but what I can do is somewhat limited. 
For instance, there appears to be a function where one can search for a specific show by typing in the name of that specific show. 
While there is indeed a place to enter text, there appears to be no "form submit button" to go along with this. 
Not a big deal; I just want to Doug Kaufman Internet: dkaufman@rahul.net 
(preferred) bn900@cleveland.freenet.edu 
David, Same old story, anybody who doesn't use the latest, greatest browser might as well be a non-person! 
I, for one, am getting really tired of this battle. 
Writing to the webmaster seems to be of little value so I just go elsewhere. 
Now, if there was just some way to be warned about really inaccessible web sites before I actually tried them? 
Marti As Judy Brewer mentioned a few emails back, the WAI Evaluation and Tools group has a beta version of a report form for reporting such problems to webmasters and creating a database of reports. 
It's at http://www.w3.org/WAI/report/ 
How does it work for this site being discussed http://www.radiospirits.com ?

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) Good point Len, I had not looked at this tool until just now. 
It seems to be a very good idea but it also would seem to require a fair amount of testing and research on the part of the person sending it If I received a form like this as a webmaster I might assume any unchecked items were okay, when the person sending it was only reporting on one or two things they observed. 
Could lead to a lot of confusion. 
It leaves me wondering just what will be included in the message that goes to the webmaster with my name on it.
