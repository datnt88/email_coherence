The source file below gives these warnings: $ tidy -errors tryjunk.html 
HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st April 2002 (no joke); built on Apr 6 2002, at 23:21:56) Parsing "tryjunk.html"

Neither of the warnings, nor the inference about HTML 3.2, look correct to me.

--------------------------------- !-- /* J. Greif, 2002/07/05 This function writes an email address into the document as it is rendered in the browser, without making that address visible to a web crawler which does not actually execute the javascript but only has access to the raw HTML source. 
This is a weak, but useful form of spam protection -- makes it harder for automated email address collecting programs to grab the address. 
function spewContact(linktext) { var p1 = "com"; var p2 = ":Me-me-me"; var p3 = "mailto"; var p4 = "blah."; 
var p5 = "?subject=re: Gibberish"; var p6 = "@"; document.write(" 
A href='", p3, p2, p6, p4, p1, p5,"' ", linktext, " /A "); -- The first warning is correct. 
It refers to the code (" /A ") inside your script. 
I suspect the second one (pointing to " /SCRIPT ") results from Tidy getting confused by the invalid "-- " on the previous line. 
What in your document do you consider to be invalid in HTML3.2? 
I can't find anything (from, admittedly, a fairly cursory look: Tidy is usually right on this). 
Fred is right about line 22. 
It wants to be " \A ", not " /A ". 
Also, curious about line 25, I tried your file on current CVS (main branch) and it gives only the first, correct, warning. 
Not sure what we did to fix that since April. 
I think what Charlie meant to say is "It wants to be " \/A ". 
This issue is probably FAQ question #1 for all Tidy users and [x]HTML validator users. 
The problem is that something that "works" in a forgiving browser is more often than not valid from a *markup* point of view. 
Bottom line: when coding end tags in Javascript in document.write()'s 
and the like, escape them so the XML (for XHTML) or SGML (for HTML) parser doesn't see it as a "real" (and out-of-place) end tag. 
You can do it in several ways: document.write("whatever 
\/a ") document.write("whatever 
" + "/a ") Etc. 
The first one uses a backslash to mean "escape the next character", i.e. "write it literally". 
So the *Javascript* parser will essentially treat the '\/' the same as a plain '/', and thus " \/a " the same as " /a ", But the *ML parser will see it as a character string of \/a " and not as an end tag. 
Check out ... /Jelks I think he's saying "I specified in my DOCTYPE declaration that I wanted HTML 4.0 Transitional, so why is it giving me that message about HTML 3.2?" 
Once the " /" script problem is fixed, it *should* validate as either 3.2 or 4.x Transitional, so that appears to be a rather spurious comment on Tidy's part. 
Make sure you're using the newest version of Tidy... /Jelks Well yes, but this is perhaps the second strongest candidate for the FAQ (after the one about " /" in scripts): Tidy obligingly tells you the "lowest" version of HTML with which your document conforms, i.e. the least one you can get away with. 
But people don't seem to like being told, for some reason.
