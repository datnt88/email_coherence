The WAI guidelines (4.2) state: Use foreground and background color combinations that provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone with color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen. 
In our A-Prompt program, we check the BODY element for background/text colors and if they are set we warn the user. 
But some color combinations are OK (white background, black text) and we shouldn't warn the user about them. 
We would like to make the program smart enough so that if it sees a large contrast between the background and text colors, it will NOT warn the user. 
We're looking for ideas on how this could be done. 
What makes a good contrast? 
Just brightness? 
Just color difference? 
What about link colors? 
Chris What about link colors? 
Color makes a difference. 
Generally, disabilities reduce sensitivity to the extremes of the light spectrum, viz. 
red and blue. 
This implies 1.There shouldn't be any red or blue on darker backgrounds, since the red and blue will get darker and reduct contast. 
2.There shouldn't be any green, yellow, cyan on lighter backgrounds (because lighter backgrounds will contain some red and blue and become darker, thus reducing contrast. 
This is a bit of a simplification, since theoretically dark green on light green is OK.) For examples of these see search down the page for "color" For more explanation, see I don't know of any good quantitative procedures, especially for people with vision impairments. 
So as a rule of thumb, follow the above rules and make contrast subjectively very high for normal vision. 
Note that simply viewing in some arbitrary monochrome does NOT constitute a good test, since the conversion to monochrome does not necessarily show what would happen with visual impairments. 
Also, note that color contrast is more important for images than for BODY color, since users can override body and font color in their browsers. 
But they can't override colors in images. 
This is another reason that background images are a problem. 
For example, if a peson chooses light text and dark BODY, then there's a big problem if the page has a light background image. 
So a tool should look at images too.

I had a look at your site and the lighthouse site and picked up some good ideas. 
The problem now is how do we quantify the colors. 
On your computer, the colors are represented by 3 values (red, green and blue) and the values range from 0 to 255. 
So what represents a poor visibility red? 
What values make up a 'dark' background? 
I have a small test program that allows you to modify the background and text colors and view their RGB values. 
I'll send you the program in a following message. 
If anyone else is interested in the program, let me know and I'll send it to you. 
Chris The values are mapped to screen intensity in a non linear way, roughly. 
a power function. 
v^gamma. 
To make matters more complicated, gamma is different for Mac's, PC's, and some unix machines like SGI. 
In addition, the allowable contrast difference depends on the size of the text. 
I looked at this a while back and didn't find satisfactory quantitative data, even for people with "normal" vision. 
We have the makings here of a good research project. 
At least an update on the literature search I did. 
Possibly some experiments. 
If someone wants to do a bit of research I'll be glad to dig up my old notes. 
Perhaps there are folks in the psychology dept up there who would like to look into this... viz. the folks in visual perception.

I have got Smith-Ketterwell to say they will help Chris a little. 
That's sorta the "buck stops here" point for visual perception AFAIK.
