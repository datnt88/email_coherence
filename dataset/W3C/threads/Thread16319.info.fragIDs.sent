<s> excerpts from November 4, 1999 New York Times: "Lawsuit Says AOL Shuts Out the Blind" By PAMELA MENDELS "In a test of the idea that virtual spaces must by law be readily accessible to people with disabilities, a major organization representing the blind filed suit against America Online Inc. on Thursday, saying that its online service is almost impossible for blind people to use."  </s>

<s> How can the NFB justify such a legal action when the organization itself generates funding from inaccessible web sites.  </s>
<s> Take a look at an online fund raising shopping service which they are linked into.  </s>
<s> It has some of the same accessibility problems they are complaining about with AOL.  </s>
<s> Interesting indeed.  </s>
<s> However, I could see some cases in which an organization (say, the WAI) wants to take money from a supporter whose web site is not yet accessible.  </s>
<s> That said, the HTML Writers Guild has been considering a proposal in which all our co-branded sites with outside partners are expected to meet the same standards of accessibility that the Guild currently requires from our own pages.  </s>
<s> I think other organizations should consider this too.  </s>
