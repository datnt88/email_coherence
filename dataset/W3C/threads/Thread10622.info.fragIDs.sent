<s> I now better understand the arguments and agree that rules rdfs12a and rdfs12b look bizarre (but are easy to implement) and would agree to move them to the place of rdfs2a rdfs3a rdfs4a' and rdfs4b' (which are indeed causing a combinatorial explosion, at least rdfs2a rdfs3a + owl) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
