<s> there's actually a simple way to make desirable non entailments if, for datatype property #bar we interpret as #foo #bar ( #bar "abc") that would not affect current RDF applications and would be no problem for generic RDF engines (and they would then make no entailments  </s>
<s> for that film title testcase that we all know) it would also allow nice datatype inferencing as e.g. #bar rdfs:range xsd:duration could make things sharper my main belief in literals denoting themselves is that that it is sound i.e. out of somthing that holds one can never derive something that doesn't hold, but it is indeed incomplete i.e. something that holds is not necessarily derivable although canonical lexical forms could make it less incomplete, to work in that way Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>

<s> Well.  </s>
<s> That's my point.  </s>
<s> Your interpretation seems to impose some closure rule whereby in the absence of an explicit datatype, the property is used as the datatype, and hence any property may be a datatype.  </s>
<s> And since membership properties which assert no actual datatype on their objects, such as rdf:li, would introduce ambiguity, I don't see that your mechanism would work.  </s>
<s> Is it really that much different to just map to #foo #bar (_:a "10") #str rdf:li (_:b "10") #int rdf:li (_:c "10") where either 1.  </s>
