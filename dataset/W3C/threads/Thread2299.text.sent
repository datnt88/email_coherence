10.22 says: All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a 400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header field. 
This conflicts with 5.1.2: 
If the absoluteURI form is used, any Host request-header included with the request MUST be ignored. 
I think 5.1.2 has it right, in which case 10.22 should read: All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a 400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks both an absoluteURI in the request line and a Host header field. 
Dave Kristol I don't see a conflict here. 
All 1.1 requests must contain a Host header. 
IF the request also contains an absoluteURI, the host information contained in it will take precedence over the information supplied in the Host header. 
Then you've basically said that all HTTP 1.1 clients must generate only absoluteURIs in HTTP/1.1 requests, which contradicts the language in 5.1.2 that states To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future versions of HTTP, HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will not normally generate them. 
Versions of HTTP after HTTP/1.1 may require absoluteURIs everywhere, after HTTP/1.1 or later have become the dominant implementations. 
Steve Wingardswingard@spyglass.com Spyglass, Inc., 1240 E. Diehl Road, Naperville, IL 60563(708) 245-6581 I admit it's fuzzy, but the second clause implies one could have omitted Host. 
Changing "any" to "the" would make it more definite that there has to have been one. 
There are four cases: 1. relativeURL, no Host 2. relativeURL, Host 3. absoluteURL, no Host 4. absoluteURL, Host I'm trying to identify which require a 400 status code. 
I believe only case 1 deserves it, which is what my suggested wording says. 
However, the original words in 10.22 state that case 3 is also an error. 
I don't think it should be. 
Dave Kristol Yes, and it is intended that it be an error. 
The sense of the group was that while it was in theory overkill to always require host, it was too likely that implementers would get it wrong. 
And a single, widespread popular client might make the attempt to deal with the host problem moot. 
So the intent is to always require host in 1.1, and require servers to generate errors if they detect anyone not playing by the rules, so that non-conforming clients get caught quickly. 
This requirement might get eased in future versions, if we succeed in overcoming the host problem.
