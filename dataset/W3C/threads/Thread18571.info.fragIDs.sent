UAWG teleconference, 6 Jun 2002 Agenda announcement: Participants: Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (Scribe), Tim Lacy, Aaron Leventhal, Harvey Bingham, Marisa Demeglio, Eric Hansen, Rich Schwerdtfeger, David Poehlman, Jim Allan Previous meeting: 23 May 2002 Next meeting: 13 Jun, 2pm ET. Reference document 12 September Candidate Recommendation: Discussion 1. Proposal for checkpoints should be "all formats" versus "formats that are part of the claim". 
Resolved: Accept IJ's proposal: 2. What to do with checkpoints with low implementation experience? 
See JG proposal: JG: Question of how to handle 19 checkpoints with low implementation experience. 
2a) Checkpoints 1.2, 9.5, 9.6 (related to events). 
RS: Please clear this proposal with the Director before returning to last call. 
Resolved: - Accept proposal to make these optional. 
- Use "Events" label - For any checkpoint where we have less than 2 implementations when going to last call, indicate in the status section. 
ACTION IJ: Ask the Director whether this type of approach is reasonable. 
2b) Checkpoint 4.4. 
Keep this and update the implementation report. 
HB: Daisy speed-up/down only addresses audio portion; not synchronized. 
MD: Enounce slows down video in WMP and RealPlayer synchronized audio/video (which formats?) This fall we should have something for Daisy and video. 
Resolved: Keep 4.4 unchanged. 
2c) Checkpoints 5.3, 5.7. 
JA: I've seen some javascript code that closes pop-up windows. 
E.g., when you click "submit" a window is closed automatically. 
Are there examples that motivate this checkpoint? 
IJ: Gregory has sent examples in the past. 
/* Teleconference interrupted for 10 minutes due to bridge problems */ JG: Seems like low-hanging fruit. 
Resolved: - Keep 5.3 - Move 5.7 as a note to 5.3. 
2d) Checkpoint 3.5 JG: Jim Ley reports that Snuffin implements this requirement. 
This is a problem for screen readers, that reset to the beginning 
of the page when page is refreshed. 
IJ: Opera has an option to let you reload a page every X minutes. 
I don't know what impact it has on pages that reload automatically. 
AL: This is in our planning document, but not a short-term plan. 
Should not be a problem to implement. 
JA: I tested this in Opera. 
If you unclick "enable", Opera doesn't get the page. 
But even if Opera set for 1-minute, on a 2-second refresh page, Opera still respected author's specified rate. 
Resolved: - Drop the alert requirement. 
- Keep the requirement for configuration to not update automatically. 
Action IJ: Follow up with Opera to see if there can be an option to never refresh (and overrides author's specified rate). 
2e) Checkpoint 10.5. 
JG: Amaya offers this functionality. 
This can also be done with user style sheets. 
This is weak implementation experience, but works in many user agents that support CSS style sheets. 
Opera, IE, Konqueror, support user style sheets. 
IJ: Mozilla has a predefined location (I think). 
Also, Acrobat Reader 5 does this for PDF (that's marked up correctly). 
IJ: Note that what's required to do an outline view in CSS is supported widely across browsers. 
Resolved: Keep 10.5, 9.10 (configuration through style sheets). 
Action JG: Update implementation report. 
2f) 11.2 Current author bindings JG: We have only one implementation (Jaws) but there is consensus to keep this one. 
Resolved: Keep 11.2 2g) 2.11 Alert unsupported language JG: We don't have implementation experience for this. 
This could be done in style sheets. 
IJ: Recall goal of this checkpoint - reduce the amount of garbage a screen reader has to wade through before the user hears something useful. 
JA: In RealPlayer, if a stream is available in several languages, you can choose from among available streams. 
JG: What does HPR do when it encounters a language it doesn't know? 
JA: I think it tries do use the default rendering. 
If you have 'auto-detect' on, HPR will switch languages dynamically.w3 
Action JA: Test HPR and report to the list. 
Resolved: Keep 2.11 even though we don't have implementation experience for this. 
2h) Resolved to make the following checkpoints informative notes in the related checkpoints 2.10 4.8, 4.7, 4.11. 
Open actions JG: Write up user scenarios for why non-text-based highlighting important for users; notably which users.

Task from UAWG teleconference, 6 Jun 2002 Test HPR behavior for alerting user about unsupported language. 
Application: HPR 3.0 with Spanish Synthesizer removed Test 1 set default language to 'auto-detect' set current language to 'auto-detect' went to an English page HPR read the page in English went to a Spanish language page HPR spoke the title of the page in English, but would speak nothing else on the page. 
it provided no indication that the language was not supported. 
Test 2 set default language to 'German' set current language to 'auto-detect' went to an English page HPR read the page in German hit CTRL-O to reset language to 'auto-detect' HPR now reads page in English Went to Spanish page HPR reads page in German hit CTRL-O to reset language to 'auto-detect' HPR read the title in German, but does not read anything else on page. it provided no indication that the language was not supported.

With automatic language detection, HPR first respects lang attributes based on its list of supported languages. 
HPR does not alert the user when an unsupported lang attribute is encountered, it just reads the page in the HPR installed language. 
If no lang attributes exist for an element on a web page, HPR determines which language is the closest match to one of its supported languages. 
Spanish and German are supported along with Finnish, English, Italian, French, and Brazilian Portuguese. 
Jim, HPR assumes all ViaVoice language engines are installed for all supported languages. 
It does not detect when a language engine is removed. 
Since ViaVoice is not reading the page, this looks like an error condition HPR should handle. 
We thought ViaVoice would just ignore the language switch if an engine was not there and read in the last language in which it spoke, but I guess we missed fully checking this out. 
We'll look into this. 
A better test would be to go to pages that are in languages that are not considered supported HPR languages, like Swedish or Norwegian. 
Also, everytime a new page is loaded, HPR resets the current language back to the default language. 
So you should always set the default language to automatic language detection or the language you usually want to hear. 
Then just change the current language if you want to hear something read on the current page in a different language.

Cathy, Do you plan to add an alert feature to HPR? 
If you do not want to tell the group publicly you can just tell Ian and he will keep in confidential.
