<s> UAWG teleconference, 6 Jun 2002 Agenda announcement: Participants: Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (Scribe), Tim Lacy, Aaron Leventhal, Harvey Bingham, Marisa Demeglio, Eric Hansen, Rich Schwerdtfeger, David Poehlman, Jim Allan Previous meeting: 23 May 2002 Next meeting: 13 Jun, 2pm ET. Reference document 12 September Candidate Recommendation: Discussion 1. Proposal for checkpoints should be "all formats" versus "formats that are part of the claim".  </s>
<s> Resolved: Accept IJ's proposal: 2. What to do with checkpoints with low implementation experience?  </s>
<s> See JG proposal: JG: Question of how to handle 19 checkpoints with low implementation experience.  </s>
<s> 2a) Checkpoints 1.2, 9.5, 9.6 (related to events).  </s>
<s> RS: Please clear this proposal with the Director before returning to last call.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Accept proposal to make these optional.  </s>
<s> - Use "Events" label - For any checkpoint where we have less than 2 implementations when going to last call, indicate in the status section.  </s>
<s> ACTION IJ: Ask the Director whether this type of approach is reasonable.  </s>
<s> 2b) Checkpoint 4.4.  </s>
<s> Keep this and update the implementation report.  </s>
<s> HB: Daisy speed-up/down only addresses audio portion; not synchronized.  </s>
<s> MD: Enounce slows down video in WMP and RealPlayer synchronized audio/video (which formats?) This fall we should have something for Daisy and video.  </s>
<s> Resolved: Keep 4.4 unchanged.  </s>
<s> 2c) Checkpoints 5.3, 5.7.  </s>
<s> JA: I've seen some javascript code that closes pop-up windows.  </s>
<s> E.g., when you click "submit" a window is closed automatically.  </s>
<s> Are there examples that motivate this checkpoint?  </s>
<s> IJ: Gregory has sent examples in the past.  </s>
<s> /* Teleconference interrupted for 10 minutes due to bridge problems */ JG: Seems like low-hanging fruit.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Keep 5.3 - Move 5.7 as a note to 5.3.  </s>
<s> 2d) Checkpoint 3.5 JG: Jim Ley reports that Snuffin implements this requirement.  </s>
<s> This is a problem for screen readers, that reset to the beginning  </s>
<s> of the page when page is refreshed.  </s>
<s> IJ: Opera has an option to let you reload a page every X minutes.  </s>
<s> I don't know what impact it has on pages that reload automatically.  </s>
<s> AL: This is in our planning document, but not a short-term plan.  </s>
<s> Should not be a problem to implement.  </s>
<s> JA: I tested this in Opera.  </s>
<s> If you unclick "enable", Opera doesn't get the page.  </s>
<s> But even if Opera set for 1-minute, on a 2-second refresh page, Opera still respected author's specified rate.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Drop the alert requirement.  </s>
<s> - Keep the requirement for configuration to not update automatically.  </s>
<s> Action IJ: Follow up with Opera to see if there can be an option to never refresh (and overrides author's specified rate).  </s>
<s> 2e) Checkpoint 10.5.  </s>
<s> JG: Amaya offers this functionality.  </s>
<s> This can also be done with user style sheets.  </s>
<s> This is weak implementation experience, but works in many user agents that support CSS style sheets.  </s>
<s> Opera, IE, Konqueror, support user style sheets.  </s>
<s> IJ: Mozilla has a predefined location (I think).  </s>
<s> Also, Acrobat Reader 5 does this for PDF (that's marked up correctly).  </s>
<s> IJ: Note that what's required to do an outline view in CSS is supported widely across browsers.  </s>
<s> Resolved: Keep 10.5, 9.10 (configuration through style sheets).  </s>
<s> Action JG: Update implementation report.  </s>
<s> 2f) 11.2 Current author bindings JG: We have only one implementation (Jaws) but there is consensus to keep this one.  </s>
<s> Resolved: Keep 11.2 2g) 2.11 Alert unsupported language JG: We don't have implementation experience for this.  </s>
<s> This could be done in style sheets.  </s>
<s> IJ: Recall goal of this checkpoint - reduce the amount of garbage a screen reader has to wade through before the user hears something useful.  </s>
<s> JA: In RealPlayer, if a stream is available in several languages, you can choose from among available streams.  </s>
<s> JG: What does HPR do when it encounters a language it doesn't know?  </s>
<s> JA: I think it tries do use the default rendering.  </s>
<s> If you have 'auto-detect' on, HPR will switch languages dynamically.w3  </s>
<s> Action JA: Test HPR and report to the list.  </s>
<s> Resolved: Keep 2.11 even though we don't have implementation experience for this.  </s>
<s> 2h) Resolved to make the following checkpoints informative notes in the related checkpoints 2.10 4.8, 4.7, 4.11.  </s>
<s> Open actions JG: Write up user scenarios for why non-text-based highlighting important for users; notably which users.  </s>

<s> Task from UAWG teleconference, 6 Jun 2002 Test HPR behavior for alerting user about unsupported language.  </s>
<s> Application: HPR 3.0 with Spanish Synthesizer removed Test 1 set default language to 'auto-detect' set current language to 'auto-detect' went to an English page HPR read the page in English went to a Spanish language page HPR spoke the title of the page in English, but would speak nothing else on the page.  </s>

<s> With automatic language detection, HPR first respects lang attributes based on its list of supported languages.  </s>
<s> HPR does not alert the user when an unsupported lang attribute is encountered, it just reads the page in the HPR installed language.  </s>
<s> If no lang attributes exist for an element on a web page, HPR determines which language is the closest match to one of its supported languages.  </s>
<s> Spanish and German are supported along with Finnish, English, Italian, French, and Brazilian Portuguese.  </s>
<s> Jim, HPR assumes all ViaVoice language engines are installed for all supported languages.  </s>
<s> It does not detect when a language engine is removed.  </s>
<s> Since ViaVoice is not reading the page, this looks like an error condition HPR should handle.  </s>
<s> We thought ViaVoice would just ignore the language switch if an engine was not there and read in the last language in which it spoke, but I guess we missed fully checking this out.  </s>
<s> We'll look into this.  </s>
<s> A better test would be to go to pages that are in languages that are not considered supported HPR languages, like Swedish or Norwegian.  </s>
<s> Also, everytime a new page is loaded, HPR resets the current language back to the default language.  </s>
<s> So you should always set the default language to automatic language detection or the language you usually want to hear.  </s>
<s> Then just change the current language if you want to hear something read on the current page in a different language.  </s>
