I am new to CSS and am wondering if there are any example accessible templates. 
Also, is it possible to create CSS in a text editor or basic word processor like Notepad? 
Since tables in particular are generally difficult, though not impossible, to make accessible to people using screen reading technology which I myself use, are there any standard CSS layouts for tables -Thanks in advance, Steven McCaffrey Information Technology Services NYSED (518)-473-3453 When I was at Microsoft, Greg Lowney put together some CSS templates. 
They are available at http://microsoft.com/enable/products/ie4.htm 
The two style sheets he put together are high contrast styles with large text.

:) Well, after vi. ;) Anyone tried any of the CSS editors yet? 
I haven't had chance to do much experimenting. 
However, CSS is just plain text, and so it's trivially easy (easier than HTML) to write it in a text editor of your choice.
