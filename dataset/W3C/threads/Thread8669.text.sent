Peter I think we should change, and not solely for consistency reasons. 
Although the DSS specifies SHA-1, it would be fairly easy to use a DSA key with RIPEMD-160, and people might well call that signature algorithm "dsa-ripe".

IETF/W3C XML-Signature Co-Chair http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/ We've been over this ground a number of times already. 
This doesn't work. 
There's a substitution attack on DSA unless the standard clearly specifies which digest algorithm to use [1]. 
Check the archives and sequelae for a description of the attack. 
-Ekr [1] Except that if you use an extension of DSA with a longer q then you can use different digest algorithms for each size of q. [Eric Rescorla ekr@rtfm.com] 
PureTLS - free SSLv3/TLS software for Java key Does this preclude us from changing the name for consistency sake. 
(Granted, we do need to specify a single algorithm for interoperability and security, but does that mean we shouldn't represent it as part of its ID?) Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org 
IETF/W3C XML-Signature Co-Chair http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/ No, but if you're going to do it that way then add the following text: IMPORTANT: DSA is subject to a digest substitution attack. 
For this reason, in DSIG the DSA algorithm MUST only be used with SHA-1, as specified in [DSS].
