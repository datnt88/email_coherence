<s> Hi, I have try -and succeeded- in compiling the release 1.2 of Amaya, this using gcc 2.7.2 under Solaris 2.5.  </s>
<s> Hereafter are listed some enhancements that could be done : 1) Instead of using directly cpp into the files thot/batch/app.c,  </s>
<s> thot/batch/prs.c,  </s>
<s> thot/batch/str.c,  </s>
<s> thot/batch/tra.c,  </s>
<s> a variable positionned by configure should be used with for example gcc -x c-header -E when using gcc.  </s>
<s> 2) In file thot/pluginlib/pluginapi.c, function Ap_GetURL line 616 the function call to GetHTMLDocument have two parameters less than the function prototype.  </s>
<s> I have expanded it as below, it compiles but I am not sure of the correction.  </s>
<s> GetHTMLDocument (url, NULL, 0, 0, CE_FALSE, TRUE, NULL, NULL);  </s>
<s> Bye, Fathi  </s>
<s> Hello Fathi,  </s>
<s> Your correction is OK.  </s>
<s> This is an oversight (my fault) in our source distribution.  </s>

<s> The right method is to process as explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Aut oconf.html  </s>
<s> One can use the following shell script in conjuction with gcc, name it cpp, put it in the PATH with 755 Unix rights: #!/bin/sh exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $* Irene.  </s>
