Hi, I have try -and succeeded- in compiling the release 1.2 of Amaya, this using gcc 2.7.2 under Solaris 2.5. 
Hereafter are listed some enhancements that could be done : 1) Instead of using directly cpp into the files thot/batch/app.c, 
thot/batch/prs.c, 
thot/batch/str.c, 
thot/batch/tra.c, 
a variable positionned by configure should be used with for example gcc -x c-header -E when using gcc. 
2) In file thot/pluginlib/pluginapi.c, function Ap_GetURL line 616 the function call to GetHTMLDocument have two parameters less than the function prototype. 
I have expanded it as below, it compiles but I am not sure of the correction. 
GetHTMLDocument (url, NULL, 0, 0, CE_FALSE, TRUE, NULL, NULL); 
Bye, Fathi 
Hello Fathi, 
Your correction is OK. 
This is an oversight (my fault) in our source distribution.

The right method is to process as explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Aut oconf.html 
One can use the following shell script in conjuction with gcc, name it cpp, put it in the PATH with 755 Unix rights: #!/bin/sh exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $* Irene.
