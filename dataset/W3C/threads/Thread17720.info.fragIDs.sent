Preface: I am not completely up to speed on DOM, particularly in terms of its implementations. 
So if I spout some rubbish, would somebody tell me to shut up and point me to the reference I should have read first before I make a real fool of myself. 
So: It seems to me that DHTML in its various guises is behind plain HTML in understanding the seperation of form and content. 
While there are scripts which are efffective in changing the presentaion of a page, and others which are used to generate or regenerate the content there seems to be no ability to nominate things as one or the other. 
Part of this is a chicken-and-egg problem - without a DOM it is difficult to write a script which explicitly has no effect on the Document Object itself, but only the presentation of that object, or to write a script which declares that its effect is on the content of the document object itself. 
But this seems like a crucial bit of information to have about the behaviour of a scripting object. 
This information seems hierarchical to me in the sense that a script could modify a presentation property of an element, for example presentation.font.size or presentation.background.image, 
or the content or status of that element and its 'relatives' in the DOM tree. 
This passes the buck to the author of the script, and the scripting language itself. 
If we can demand that a script declare which properties it affects, or automagically determine that information, we need not bug a user with a whole lot of objects which create (for example) rollover highlights, and can also hope to present those highlights in another medium using appropriate styling where available. 
This idea is still half-baked, but I thought I would toss it to the lions as a draft. 
And I still have a nagging feeling that I am just repeating something that has already been said somewhere.

We cannot think of Dynamic HTML as only operating on current HTML elements. 
Dyanmic HTML needs to be though of as an application interface, that will create and modify the HTML content on the screen based on user actions and portential interactions with application servers. 
Only the simpliest uses of DHTML can we think of it like a style sheet which only affects the rendering of static HTML elements.

This is true. 
What interests me is the question of whether, rather than an ID identifying the elements which are dynamic, we can put it on the script author (or the user agent to automagically extract the information from the script) to declare which elements they act on. 
(Is this a page authoring thing? 
or not yet?) This information combined with a knowledge of which properties (or classes of properties) are affected could be used to sort out which events are important for the user to be able to predict in advance, and which need not be worried about.
