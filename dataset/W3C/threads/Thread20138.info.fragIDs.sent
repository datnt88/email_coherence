<s> just downloaded amaya and trying to configure after running several other browsers since Web started have noted several glitches in documentation and how amaya does some common things  </s>
<s> [1] setting home page amaya requires FULL url including http:// this is fair but the on-line help could have been more HELPful by noting this.  </s>
<s> This retired teacher knows that EXAMPLES help in readability.  </s>
<s> Perhaps reviewing the on-line help and adding examples to topics will help others as well.  </s>
<s> [2] Color settings Using the dialog box --- will it respect all named colors will it accept hex codings, or decimal coding alternates.  </s>
<s> The help page is silent on this and once again exampleS would make it clear.  </s>
<s> And the named colors i picked didnt even come close to rendering correctly -- my favorite is 'wheat' which is easy on the eyes but try it in Amaya --- a dithered blue ugh!  </s>
<s> Using the pallet -- and quite an unusual one it is instead of the one seen in most programs --- may be a unix thing though i am much more familiar with windows and this one may be necessary for cross platform --- its a shame cuz it severely restricts one's choice.  </s>
<s> The selected colors did not display when the apply button was pressed... i had to exit Amaya and restart it to see effect.  </s>
<s> This does not foster experimentation does it.  </s>
<s> Apply should apply immediately....  </s>
<s> I loaded Amaya to experiment with MathMl so i expect i will be happier with it as there is no standard of comparison ie no competition.... but on standard user expected features there seems a ways to go ... and the documentation is about right for the price paid :-) :-)  </s>
<s> Hello John, Thank you for your time spent criticizing the Amaya doc.  </s>
<s> Yes, it needs a full URL, or a filesystem URL, depending on whether your home page is on-line or local.  </s>
<s> Note that we use the term home page more in the sense of "first page that Amaya should show when launched".  </s>
<s> It accepts both named colors and RGB encoded strings.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't find such color, it'll use the default ones.  </s>
<s> This week I'm away from the office, so I can't send/update the doc with a more meaningful example.  </s>
<s> Our color palette may be wrong.  </s>
<s> I suppose you're using Windows?  </s>
<s> Yes, it's the same for code compatiblity reasons.  </s>
<s> In the doc, it says: "The color changes will be effective when you open a new document window or when reloading a document."  </s>
<s> For the moment, these changes are not visibly immediately.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, we have very limited resources... but in one of your follow up mails you give a suggestion... wait till I get there :) -Jose  </s>
<s> Hi John, We completely agree with you.  </s>
<s> The documentation is incomplete, sometimes unclear and needs more examples.  </s>
<s> Our problem is that first, we have limited resources and second, developers are not the best peoples able to write documentation.  </s>
<s> We will be very happy to have contributors to the Amaya documentation.  </s>
<s> We're ready to add their name as Amaya contributors.  </s>
<s> In-reply-to: Your message of Sun, 08 Aug 1999 00:36:47 -0400."  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> This is not normal.  </s>
<s> It should react immediatly.  </s>
<s> Could you give us a specific scenario where the error occurs.  </s>
