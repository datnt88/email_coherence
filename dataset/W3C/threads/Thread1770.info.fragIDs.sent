<s> Hi, one way to create a workspace in reference to an existing one is to use MKWORKSPACE with referencing a baseline of the baseline-controlled source workspace.  </s>
<s> If I don't support baselines at all.  </s>
<s> How is this done then?  </s>
<s> (Given that a workspace (collection) is under version-controll as well as all subordinate collections.)  </s>
<s> Is it allowed that a workspace as collection (it is per definitionem) is under version-control in terms of version-controlled collection?  </s>
<s> Would COPY provide me the result I'm loking for?  </s>

<s> If you don't support baselines, the only way to create a workspace that has VCR's that select versions from existing VHR's is to issue a separate VERSION-CONTROL request (identifying the desired version) to create each VCR.  </s>
<s> (And if you think, "isn't that a fairly costly way of creating such a workspace", the answer is yes, and to avoid the cost, your server can support baselines :-).  </s>
