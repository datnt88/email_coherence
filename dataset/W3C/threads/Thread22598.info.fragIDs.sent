The new version is available at 
KeyEvent are now more character devices oriented. 
This is the result of a coordination between WAI, Internationalization, SVG, and DOM.

It is now checkModifier - Added initModifier.

From the latest draft I retrieved the java bindings then Upon replacing the full events package and compiling, I get the following compilation errors 
org/w3c/dom/events/EventTargetGroup.java:15: cannot resolve symbol symbol : class EventListener location: package dom import org.w3c.dom.EventListener; org/w3c/dom/events/KeyEvent.java:16: cannot resolve symbol symbol : class UIEvent location: package dom import org.w3c.dom.UIEvent; 
In each case, the import statement omits the .events 
subpackage. 
Corrected statements follow, compilation is satisfactory, and corrected files are attached. 
org/w3c/dom/events/EventTargetGroup.java:15: 
import org.w3c.dom.events.EventListener; 
org/w3c/dom/events/KeyEvent.java:16: import org.w3c.dom.events.UIEvent;

The 'soon to be published' new draft will merge DOM Level 2 and 3 Events. 
It should fix the problems.
