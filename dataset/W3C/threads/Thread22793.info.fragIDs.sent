<s> Alright, I'll bite.  </s>
<s> Give me a good use case for hasAttribute or hasAttributeNS versus getAttribute() != null.  </s>
<s> I'm sure it has something to do with ancient programming languages like C++ ;-) Keith  </s>
<s> Minor opportunity for memory-management optimization.  </s>
<s> Some DOMs (eg those which run as proxy for other data representations) may not create actual Attr objects until they're retrieved.  </s>
<s> hasAttribute tests for presence without requiring that the object be instantiated.  </s>
<s> Basically, it's a workaround for the fact that getAttribute can't distinguish attribute-doesn't-exist from attribute-value-is-empty-string.  </s>
<s> Not essential, but "mostly cheap and harmless".  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> There is no way by calling getAttribute() to determine whether an attribute exists as an empty string or does not exist.  </s>
<s> Both cases return an empty string, not a null.  </s>
<s> getAttribute() != null will never happen in an implementation that follows the spec properly (I wrote one that didn't, and I expect others have, but it will have to be fixed...).  </s>
<s> You could test getAttributeNode() every time before getting the attribute and test that for null, but in a number of implementations, the attribute node never gets constructed unless it is explicitly referenced, so that causes significant extra work, just to discover whether the attribute existed or not.  </s>
<s> There's no "fixing" getAttribute at this point to make it return null if the attribute does not exist.  </s>
<s> It had to do with some environment or another, I don't remember which.  </s>
