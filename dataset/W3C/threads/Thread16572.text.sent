[DJW:] However, the audience for this sort of thing, when it appears in books, is generally people who want cook book solutions to improving their ability to impress people with spending power, rather than their ability to convey information to everyone that might want that information. 
Generally such people either have no concept of an accessibility issue, or believe that adding accessibility will cost them money, and probably compromise the effect of the site, without gaining them money In other words, they're the target audience for WAI and other web accessibility education efforts. 
:) By labeling their -pet tech toys- as inaccessible, rather than the -mindset-, we risk major confusion regarding what we're trying to convey. 
In truth, "HTML Tricks", Flash, or DHTML is _not_ the threat; the threat is webmasters who don't understand how to use them properly. 
If we make sweeping statements that "DHTML is bad" or "Flash is useless and hinders accessibility", then we are _forcing_ web designers to think they have to make a choice between "being accessible" or "not compromising my site". 
And that's exactly why people think "well, either I can use Flash, and reach my primary target audience with an optimized user experience for them, or I can be 'accessible' and be unable to use Flash." 
A more correct vision of the web is that it's ENTIRELY POSSIBLE to use any of those technologies, as long as you make sure the -content- is available in some other way. 
By this approach, there really are no "inaccessible technologies", because we are talking about _content_ not about the forms that content is expressed in.

[DJW:] In the context of books and conferences, I'd say the real threat was authors and speakers who pander to the "wants" of such people. 
I don't know the speakers in this conference, but most books and many authoring web site fall in that category. 
[DJW:] I find it interesting to note that such a statement is usually made about PDF (actually, on the sort of site that is likely to use flash etc., it is the PDF that is likely to contain real information, not the HTML - I tend to treat the HTML as a hazard to navigation in finding the PDF).

Calling it "pandering" and dismissing the "wants" -- which are often based on pretty sound, if not inclusive, principles of marketing and design -- is a good way to get these people to not listen to us. 
:) I don't like it when people claim, in a vacuum, that PDF is inaccessible either. 
The presence of PDF does _not_ make a site inaccessible; it's the _absence_ of non-PDF access to the content which does so! Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com

From the September 4, 2000 issue of Government Computer News: BTW, just since it's semi-topical, I feel the "policeman" motif and metaphor for Bobby is rather sadly mischosen...I feel there's a negative aspect associated with the idea of Bobby "policing" Web like some sort of "accessibility cop" instead of being a useful tool for self-analysis. 
It's unfortunate that an image of authority and law enforcement was selected and is the most visible "public face" of the Web accessibility movement.

it just seemed like a good metaphore at the time. 
Kynn -- Your view may be correct -- unfortunately, you're also fighting the market presence of the Bobby brand. 
I'll wager that the public at large knows more about who/what Bobby is than they do about CAST....I wouldn't change the name or the icon at this point. 
Wait until market maturity has maxed out, then make the change.

Web sites are not accessible because people are mean or even stupid, they are inaccessible because people are ignorant and need to be taught. 
When I named the AWARE Center, I was very pleased to come up with an acronym that worked :) but also which summarizes what I see as the challenge -- making people -aware-, not hitting them with a truncheon as if they're London wags who have had a bit too much Guinness to drink. 
--Kynn PS: I discovered two years at CSUN that some blind web designers were not even aware the Bobby has a police motif! 
Unable to see the graphics which are the primary way of conveying the "English policeman" metaphor, one designer even had assumed that "Bobby" was just the name of a cute little boy! 
She was amazed to find out that the web accessibility site she'd been referring people to had a "law enforcement" theme to it.

Mike, I completely agree with both you and Kynn. 
Though the name is, at times, problematic, it is a very recognizable brand that is known in the broader community. 
There have been extremely strong rumors that CAST is planning to drop the Bobby name entirely, for these reason\s. 
I believe that this would be an extreme disservice to the whole web accessibility "cause".

The fact that CAST has received industry support from Sun, IBM, Microsoft, and Mitsubishi is also a strong indication that the name suits them fine. 
I understand Kynn's feelings on the matter and, from a philosphical standpoint, I agree. 
But this is all business to me -- and "our" business mission is to build awareness and develop creative accessibility initiatives. 
Bobby clearly fits that model. 
After all, which do you remember? 
The NCAM web access symbol or the Bobby constable!

Hopefully everyone on this list remembers the NCAM logo. 
The problem with it is that it doesn't, strictly speaking, mean anything. 
Should sites post all three (Bobby, WCAG, Web Access Logo) banners? 
I would guess that there won't be a "Section 508 compliant" button. 
Hmm, should CAST have a "rename our service" contest in a couple of years?

jill The flurry of recent discussion about the Bobby symbol shows this group understands that visual images are important but I will return to Kynn's earlier statement, shown above. 
His perspective is right on target and pertinent for the population I work with and talk with every day -- graphic designers, artists, who design web sites. 
I'm one of them, I'm married to one, I work with them -- and I am the only one who studies accessible design because of passion for the topic. 
They are passionate about their work, their art, their creations, and their nifty tools like Flash and Javascript and PDF and making art of type to control its appearance. 
I use those tools, too. 
Love 'em. 
What I want these folks to have, and what I try to give, is coaching and routine conversation and examples of how they can use all those tools and still be accessible.

The Bobby icon is now widely recognized, was not intended to represent authority, and is problematic now that Bobby is used on every continent. 
We realize that some Websites avoid using the icon because it is a cop or, in some cases, because it seems too goofy. 
It is true that Bobby is more well known than CAST, a small not-for-profit educational technology R &amp; D organization. 
Briefly, the Bobby icon was originally intended to represent the friendly English cop on the beat prepared to prevent problems before they occur. 
Only later did it occur to us that an English cop might be viewed as a symbol of authority or even imperialism in some parts of the world. 
We had modest expectations at the time. 
We have commissioned the design of a new icon and it will be available soon but we do not intend to change the name of the accessibility tool. 
Bobby will remain Bobby. 
Your comments are appreciated and confirm our own concerns with the current icon. 
I sort of wish we could keep but its gotta go. 
By the way, I thought that Bobby got a pretty good review in the 9/4/00 GNC at was highly unusual for Government Computer News to evaluate freeware.
