Part of the task I've set myself is to understand the requirements of visually impaired users of websites so that I can preach successfully for Web Standards adoption giving a reason for so doing (not the only reason). 
I asked round at work (a software house) and found that the term was not understood as I had hoped, so opted for a small straw poll. 
I mailed an archaeological mailing list of which I'm a member, because I thought that here was a fairly interested net savvy bunch of people, with the following: QUOTE I'm writing about accessibility. 
I need some opinions - you will not be quoted, I just need to clarify my understanding. 
Would you be kind enough to give me (off list to avoid clutter to following: 1) If a website is accessible, what does it mean? 
2) If a museum display is accessible, what does that mean? 
Thanks in advance UNQUOTE The first question was for the answer I was looking, the second was a control, as most archaeologists have involvement with museums, and accessibility of museum displays is very important if anyone wants funding! 
I received 27 responses in an eight hour period. 
(that's about 7% of the list) This is an analysis: Question 1 (Website accessibility) 7 people gave an answer that in some way or another reasonably well defined accessibility as it is defined by WAI, 2 of these saying that Bobby compliance was a necessity. 
Only one person mentioned WAI by name. 
2 people gave partial answers to the above question. 1 person gave examples of web standards compliant code without mentioning visual or other handicap. 
Question 2 (Museum accessibility) 13 mentions of physical or visual disability 11 mentions (some the same people above) that to be accessible the display should be intellectually accessible. 
My first conclusion (and these are only from this limited straw poll) is that although accessibility is in some way understood, its not applied in the same way to electronic access as it is to physical access among this group. 
My second thoughts concern the use of the term accessible - and the task we have in promoting improved accessibility as a natural consequence of adopting web standards. 
How should it be explained? 
I'm using examples such as braille readers, speech devices, internet TV and mobile devices in my teaching and hoping that people will understand. 
My conclusion is (unless anyone can suggest a way) that when talking about web standards and accessibility that it has to be defined - at least until the term gets into general acceptance. 
It's not much use talking about accessibility as a consequence of using web standards unless the term itself is fully understood, and to make that happen we'll have to explain it every time. 
Its certainly made me think about the language and explanations I'm using to describe the reasons for adopting standards compliance. 
Regards John I am by no means an expert in this area, but this question got me thinking, and I wanted to write it down. 
I haven't read the accessibility docs in a long time, so I don't remember if there was a definition in there, and I don't know if this is even what you were looking for, but I will take a stab at a formal definition of how /I/ define and explain the term accessible: Take any document such as a novel, magazine, or newspaper. 
These documents are more than just a sequence of hieroglyphs - they have attributes such as whitespace, fonts, and color - this is "presentation". 
Presentation is the syntax of a document, this syntax is used to convey semantics. 
At the most basic level, we (normally) use the syntax of whitespace (and punctuation) to define a sequence of hieroglyphs semantically as words, sentences, and paragraphs. 
At a higher level we often use presentation such as large font sizes or color to convey the semantic of headings, and italics to convey emphasis. 
These semantics are what constitute a documents structure. 
The mapping of syntax to semantics - presentation to structure - (and back) - is not universal. 
The mapping is effected by everything from the medium being used (visual/auditory), to the culture defining the presentation (language/text direction), to limitations in peoples ability to perceive a given presentation (deaf/blind). 
Knowing the structure of a document facilitates the ability for creation of a mapping from it's structure to a presentation suitable for a particular viewer - this is accessibility. 
Chris Hubick Thanks Chris I'll digest what you've sent and reply. 
What I was looking for was not so much the definition as the perception of the term accessibility amongst those who are not part of the loop promoting it - in this case the net savvy, a lot of them with their own websites and/or involved in the production of websites, mostly public sector so come under any disability discrimination legislation (the term in use in the U.K.) If the majority had understood the term I wouldn't be bothered, but as only a third of respondents mentioned anything to do with the term as we understand it, it needs explainaing (as you've done) or exemplifying in other ways. 
Still working on this one. 
BTW, the websites to which I referred are public sector John from: Chris Hubick chris@hubick.com

I am not surprised, my first short term independent contract agreement was with a professor working with digital media. 
He used Jaws and could not see at all, yet has been working on the Internet and with the Internet as well as teaching specialized topics in business for years. 
He was not fully aware of what accessibility is or how to make things work. 
Accessibility includes access of information or content to a wider variety of users with various means of accessing the information, including but not limited to: motor, cognition, hearing, and vision. 
Care needs to be taken when focussing on access issues that we are aware of the other cases or situations. 
Why? 
Because some focus either leaves out other groups, or even makes it harder for other groups, unless we are careful when we use these items or when we may decide to take some items out. 
[multimedia and graphics may be paramount to understanding content for those with cognitive or even motor challenges.]. 
I do believe average populations and more benefit from charts, graphs, diagrams, table structures, and visual examples. 
Increasing awareness is also part of the design/development specialists job. 
[*] The Dayton Art Institute and Access Art [one of the first I am aware of] an accessibly enhanced online art museum [nice examples of how it can be done - multimedia to textual content and alternatives] how it is done] the TV understand. 
It helps to try these items out while visiting web sites, especially sites with many pages containing information about products or services. 
It is helpful also to visit web sites with detailed forms. 
I think the active demonstration imprints a message and highlights the challenges of how our content works for others. 
Try this in various ways: With the monitor off and listening, navigating with a screen reader.[visual] 
Without a mouse, navigate and use a web site[some that are familiar with keyboard shortcuts will have less trouble][motor/some cognitive groups] But also try this using one hand or one finger only[motor] Some people access the web with specialized keys because they cannot press two keys a the same time[ctrl + shift + key is nearly impossible otherwise or key combinations across the keyboard is difficult, too] Some use a stick or mouth stick to access a web site. 
I think active demonstration is a good way. 
Also remember that the Internet opens up access for those that may be homebound or unable to access information in other ways. 
From their own computers they have the opportunity to access a variety of content and are students, users, and consumers, too. 
articles, and demonstrations regarding a variety of access topics. 
There are how-to pieces, links to resources, explanations of the WAI priorities, law, etc. 
A good web site to recommend to those interested in accessibility and delivery of content.
