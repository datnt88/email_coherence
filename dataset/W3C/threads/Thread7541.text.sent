Is there any advantage to the project (WebDAV or DASL) in having an Internet Draft submitted soon (i.e. is there some cutoff date with regards to the upcoming IETF such that IDs submitted before it will have either some extra status at that meeting or will serve as evidence of useful amounts of activity?). 
I seems to me that it's possible to write some drafts, though they might be sketchy. 
Is 'sketchy' okay? 
I don't in the least claim that I would be the rightful author, I just wanted to name them.

regards The deadline for submission of Internet Drafts before the upcoming IETF meeting is Friday, March 13, at 5PM US Eastern time. 
Since drafts submitted on the deadline before the Washington meeting were actually showing up in the I-D directory *during* the Washington IETF, I recommend submitting I-Ds a week in advance of the deadline. 
An I-D submitted right before a meeting has no more special status than one submitted at any other time, but, given its proximity to the meeting, it has the possibility of being more relevant and in-synch with current concerns and discussion. 
The conventional wisdom for submitting I-Ds before the meeting is so that people coming to the meeting will have enough time to read the relevant I-Ds before the meeting. 
Certainly, regular submission of I-Ds indicates that activity is taking place on a particular topic. 
However, as far as the IETF is concerned, the major progress indicators are documents submitted to the IESG. 
There's very much a "move it or lose it" attitude in the IETF. 
be Anyone may submit an I-D. 
While the Chair of a working group does have discretion over which I-Ds are considered official work items of a particular working group, it is certainly possible for someone to develop a draft and submit it as an Internet-Draft at any time (except for the blackout period before an IETF meeting). 
The "sketchyness" of I-Ds varies. 
A draft must be complete enough to convey your ideas, and must be sufficiently well-thought to avoid embarassment. 
As for your enumeration of drafts, I will leave the discussion of DASL-related drafts to the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating mailing list, www-webdav-dasl@w3.org. 
As for the requirements for external members/ordered collections, I have encouraged Judith Slein to submit such a draft before the I-D deadline so we can discuss external members/ordered collections at the LA IETF. 
I certainly think such a draft should be a work item of this working group. 
Since there will be relatively few open issues in the Distributed Authoring specification during the LA IETF, I anticipate the discussion at the LA IETF will mostly focus on ordered collections requirements issues. 
- Jim - Jim It's always is a good idea to go into a BOF with explicit internet drafts. 
They're part of what the IESG looks at to see if the working group's charter is feasible and that there's a core of interest. 
The cutoff date is March 13 5 PM EST, but getting them in sooner than that is a very good idea. 
If the draft is "sketchy", just say so in the preface. 
I have just redone the requirements draft incorporating feedback on the list. 
I submitted this as an ID today. 
The DASL protocol authors are reviewing a 'sketchy' protocol draft as we speak. 
We will be submitting this before the deadline also.
