<s> Could the spec allow for customization of the authentication dialog?  </s>
<s> Just wondering, -e  </s>
<s> The only customization allowed for is the value of the realm, which should be displayed to the user (if any) if challenging for the credentials.  </s>
<s> In thinking about customizing this, bear in mind that some clients will not be browsers and will not have human users.  </s>
<s> FWIW, ages ago I asked for (and was denied) the addition of a "prompt" attribute, which would have been (one of) the thing the user saw in the dialog box.  </s>
<s> The argument against at the time was, I think, that such an attribute could be used by a malicious server to fool the user into giving credentials for a spoofed authentication domain.  </s>
<s> Notwithstanding that valid criticism, I still think a "prompt" attribute could be useful.  </s>
<s> In one application I wrote, users have to register before they can gain access to "protected" documents.  </s>
<s> The project, and hence the realm, is "SEPTEMBER".  </s>
<s> But to remind users that they have to register first, I had to make the HTTP realm attribute be "SEPTEMBER (You must have registered)", so browsers would present that string, and users would get the useful hint.  </s>

<s> I agree, I think quite a few web applications end up doing their own authentication simply because the default prompt is unfriendly.  </s>
<s> Specification of a prompt doesn't need to mean replacement of the existing prompt.  </s>
<s> Perhaps rather than prompt, what could be specified would be a comment to be included in the login dialog box.  </s>
<s> By calling it a comment (or realm description) and requiring continued presentation of the server name and realm I think there is no valid criticism.  </s>
<s> Since the REALM still governs the process, non-human clients would have no conflict.  </s>
<s> It would also be very useful if user agents would allow the user to review the body associated with the 401 response WITHOUT canceling the authentication prompt.  </s>
<s> In any case, this seems well out of bounds for what we can consider for HTTP/1.1 ... or does the apparent undocking of authentication leave more wiggle room?  </s>
