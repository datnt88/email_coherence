Many sites use input boxes to accept data for submission to a site search utility. 
However the following simple test program will show that Amaya 8.1a offers no control over the sizing of this control. 
Older programs use the size attribute and newer ones the width property to design clean forms. 
these re messed up by Amaya. 
Note how the go button is presented when you view the site search on w3.org with any other browser ... then observe what happens with amaya.... and this is the tip of the iceberg.... 
Is it not possible to get attributes (circa 1990's) and css1 properties (circa 2000) working correctly. 
Some of the Amaya page blurbs seem like they are written by advertising firms or Bush's speech writers ((( now that is harsh -- your blurbs are not blatent lies ;-] ;-] ))) John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA check HTML at http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ 
check CSS at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ check JavaScript at http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jslint.html 
Just noticed that i forgot the demo... the fix should not be that difficult!

check CSS at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ check JavaScript at http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jslint.html Attribute size and CSS property width are now working properly in the CVS base. 
Thanks for pointing this out. 
By the way, the demo document is wrong. 
"input" is not an allowed value for attribute type in element input, but Amaya did not catch this error. 
This bug is fixed too. 
Vincent.
