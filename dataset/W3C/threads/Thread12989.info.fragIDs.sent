<s> Dear EOWG, Thought this post to WAI-IG was worth drawing to your attention wrt 'Evaluating or Accessibility'.  </s>
<s> Has anyone on this group any direct experience with SSB's products (http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/)?  </s>

<s> 07/08/01 11:29 To the list, I just looked at the review for SSB's InSight and InFocus products and thought it was pretty positive with respect to the products.  </s>
<s> For example: - According to CNET's bottom line, "SSB Technologies software products are the best in their class" - "InSight does a fantastic job of easily locating files or entire Web sites for review."  </s>
<s> - "The user interface is excellent" - "For the enterprise user looking for a quick fix that's plug-and-play easy to use, you can't buy similar products as thoughtful or as intuitive."  </s>
<s> - "InSight 4.0 and InFocus 4.0 work together to provide the best solution in Section 508 compliance software" - "One of this program's best features is the Spider, which can burrow through an entire Web site or down the directory of a large site segment.  </s>
<s> This timesaving feature can retrieve and diagnose an entire site at once--the perfect solution for users who are retrofitting a massive number of documents."  </s>
<s> The only critical comments in the review seemed to relate to customer service, though based on my experience, I can't complain.  </s>

<s> I will on Monday, they are coming to our Committee meeting and doing a 1 hour demo of their tools.  </s>

<s> Hello EOWG: SSB Technologies presented their tools at our CMAC Accessibility committee meeting on August 13th.  </s>
<s> We were shown both tools, InSight 508 and InFocus 508.  </s>
<s> From what I can tell, it looks like you can customize the tools so that you could do WCAG validation instead of Section 508 (or both, I suppose).  </s>
<s> My one concern was about how well it would integrate with Frontpage 2000, the standard here at the State of Connecticut.  </s>
<s> You cannot open your web pages from within your FrontPage web with these tools (as you can with other HTML editors, such as HomeSite or Notepad).  </s>
<s> You must export your pages out of your web into another folder on your computer, run the tools against those copied pages, and then import those pages back into your web, overlaying your originals.  </s>
<s> I have been given a demo evaluation copy which I am planning on running against a couple of our sites next week (Tues &amp; Wed.).  </s>
<s> I should have more to report after that.  </s>

<s> hi kathleen, question on the the auditing function.  </s>
<s> this would be considered a plus to track changes.  </s>
<s> i do not think these tools export or integrate into Software Configuration Management Tools.  </s>
<s> Is there a report generated to one HTML or Word document or Spreadhseet?  </s>
<s> this could be used and then attached to or referenced for change request.  </s>
<s> What authoring tools do these products support and how do they integrate.  </s>
<s> Commands on the toolbar?  </s>
<s> do they find issues AND make recommendations?  </s>
<s> or provide options or changes to code?  </s>
<s> have you looked at macromedia's acessibility plug-in for evaluatin and repair?  </s>
<s> understand "Ultradev" has it now and will soon be incoporated into Dreamweaver.  </s>
<s> Does SSB Technologies they have a client list and have you checked references for its installation and support, plus ease of use/training?  </s>
<s> Would be interested ina product comparison between SSB's and Macromedia's product.  </s>
<s> cheers, rob  </s>
<s> Hi Robert: I should be able to answer most of your questions by the end of this week - we are downloading the demo and running it here against some live sites on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.  </s>
<s> I will be happy to post a write-up that answers your questions and generally describes how the demo went, including installation and ease of use.  </s>
<s> I won't however, be able to give a comparison between SSB's products and the Macromedia accessibility plugin, as we don't use Macromedia's products.  </s>
