<s> Well I tried to reproduce the bug, but didn't succeeded.  </s>
<s> On my Linux machines the palette opens properly, both with a 16 bit TrueColor display and with a standard 8 plane display.  </s>
<s> Could you give me more informations on : - the client machine : Elf or a.out, wich version of XFree is installed a result of ldd on thot/bin/LINUX-ELF/amayamain (or thot/bin/LINUX/amayamain on an a.out system) would be useful.  </s>
<s> - The Xserver machine if using a remote display, e.g. on a Sun.  </s>
<s> In this case the result of a xdpyinfo could help too.  </s>
