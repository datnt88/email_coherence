<s> Yeah, why waste your time on checking when there are prizes to be figured out!  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> I'll get thinking!  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I took a look at your examples, unpacked them on w3.org, and  </s>
<s> made a few tweaks.  </s>
<s> First, I started unpacking your msg into .xml,  </s>
<s> .n3, and .t  </s>
<s> files; got halfway through and figured it'd be easier to get a .zip of the originals from you.  </s>
<s> I worked from the (derrived) .nt  </s>
<s> files since I'm not a huge .n3 fan yet,  </s>
<s> chopped out some bits that appeared to be cruft from Cwm, and then ran them through a cleanup of my rdfviz.org  </s>
<s> perl script hacked to eat a (subset of!  </s>
<s> eek...) ntriples.  </s>
<s> todo: - need a Perl ntriples parser (Dan, did you write one of these?)  </s>
<s> - if you're interested, get you write access to the directory  </s>
<s> - refine the tests (maybe in .n3 or just in plain .nt  </s>
<s> ?) - generate .png  </s>
<s> visualisations - show to some selected SOAP folk (hi Hugo!  </s>
<s> ;-) I found running the .nt  </s>
<s> through a visualiser made for a nice way of picking up glitches in the data (eg.  </s>
<s> you need to s/Think/Thing/ in test001).  </s>
<s> One nitpic: what's with the daml-equiv stuff?  </s>
<s> Why do we need that?  </s>
<s> It's a hack so that I can give the () list a name.  </s>
<s> You could just merge the two if you wanted.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking that if we can avoid RDFisms in our representation of SOAP data, we might get away with persuading them to adopt NTriples as a testing format... What do you reckon?  </s>
<s> Anyway work so far (inc.  </s>
<s> a .png for 1st two tests; 2nd is prettier) is all at I figure there are three reasons at least why this is interesting: - SOAP conformance testing - visualisation of SOAP data structures - RDF/SOAP interoperability Dan  </s>
<s> yes; these might be a bit out of date by now, but they parse something pretty close to n-triples: Neither of the above does string un-quoting.  </s>
<s> I think the one that spits out KIF is more current w.r.t. whitespace and comments.  </s>
<s> Interesting tactic!  </s>

<s> It would be, but I don't have any originals.  </s>
<s> Just composed them in my mail client and pasted into cwm as necessary.  </s>
<s> Sure, I'd be happy to help out.  </s>
<s> Not sure how difficult the ACL process for that is over there, though.  </s>
<s> That could definitely be interesting.  </s>
<s> I'm always up for a good SOAP- RDF mapping!  </s>
