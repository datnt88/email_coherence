<s> Hi all, Firstly a quick question: which web browsers (on which platforms)implement the CSS :lang() selector?  </s>
<s> And an observation:  </s>
<s> I've been playing around with the CSS :lang() selector on Mozilla (Windows).  </s>
<s> The current versions support the :lang() selector when the XHTML 1.0/HTML lang attribute is used.  </s>
<s> On the version of Mozilla I'm using (1.4), the :lang() selector does not work when only the xml:lang attribute is used (i.e. in XHTML 1.1).  </s>
<s> I'm curious as to behaviour in other browsers and other platforms.  </s>

<s> Opera 7 unfortunately does not (see http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/css/  </s>
<s> My book Dynamic HTML (by Danny Goodman) says no for IE and NN (although I think the book only covers up to NN6).  </s>
<s> It says it is supported by IE/Mac 5. I just put a quick test file together and tried it on the browser versions I have on my Windows XP based computer.  </s>
<s> I found that it did work on NN7.1 and Mozilla 1.3, but didn't work on IE 6, Opera 7.11 or Amaya 8.0.  </s>
<s> I got the same result for * [lang |= "fr"] { .... } except for Opera, which does recognise this.  </s>

<s> Are you sure you are not running into MIME Type issues (i.e., your document is delivered as text/html and not application/xhtml+xml)?  </s>
