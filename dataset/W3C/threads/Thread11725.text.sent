Hello Choi, Many thanks for your translation! 
It took some work, but I found the spec at: Please do not use URIs that have characters encoded according to local conventions. 
This will not work across the Web, nor with XML or XLink. 
To identify the character encoding of the document, please do not use "ks_c_5601-1987". 
According to this refers to Nr. 149 in the ISO registry, i.e. only the two-byte part of "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr", but not the one-byte characters contained in your document. 
Therefore, the document also doesn't validate: %25ba%25c6%25e51%7E7%25c0%25e5.htm 
Please use either "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr", as appropriate. 
Also, if you can work a bit on the style of the document (ideally, keep the original style), I guess it would be easier to read. 
Thierry - Can you add the translation to the SMIL translation page? 
Regards, Martin. 
There was some mistake. 
Please check the address above. 
Becuase the name of htm file was written in korean, you cannot read it on your computer. 
Please copy and paste that file name on your web browser and check it. 
Thank you. 
your regards Martin, Should I link tothis URI that have characters encoded ? 
This translation is based on the SMIL 2.0 spec dated ww.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil20-20000921/ Which is not the current WD now available at I think we should translate only REC documents as WD are not stable. 
On the SMIL translation page available at We already link to a Korean translation of (SMIL) 1.0 Recommendation There was some mistake. 
Please check the address above. 
Becuase the name of htm file was written in korean, you cannot read it on your computer. 
Please copy and paste that file name on your web browser and check it. 
Thank you. 
your regards Martin is it possible to add in the encourage people to translate only specifications at the REC level. 
A spec is subject to change, and there is strong opportunity to have information that is not right in the nature. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- Hello Karl, Thierry, We can certainly encourage people to update their translations to REC, and to make it clear that something is not a REC (which they will do automatically if they correctly translate the 'Status of this Document'. 
Forbidding to translate WDs,... was discussed earlier, but rejected. 
Translating something at an early stage allows people to get more familiar with what we do early, to comment,... 
As for publishing something that is not right, we do that all the time. 
While we can ask translators to upgrade in place, to remove old versions, to add additional warnings,... if there is a new version, and so on, WE OURSELVES never add any warning for an old WD, nor do we remove it. 
Regards, Martin. 
I understand your point Martin. 
I agree but we serve always the latest version by default. 
Maybe we can add a comment in the example In the CASE of a WD, We can have a RED comment, large size font... "This is a working DRAFT subject to change" Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---
