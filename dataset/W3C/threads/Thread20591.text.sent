1. Revs 5 and onward save invalid X/HTML documents rather than providing an error message. 
This happens when editing the Source view, or when copying other documents and using the regular editing view. 
This was not always the case.

This has been important in allowing people who are going to edit source code to do more or less anything. 
You can synchronise before saving which will let you know if there are parsing errors. 
An exception to this, which I think is a bug, is that it does not correctly test for the presence of an alt attribute, which is required by all HTML versions implemented in Amaya.

Also, saving other docs after browsing with regular view does not alert me to bad markup.

So I tried to reproduce this (Amaya 6.1). 
It doesn't work with XHTML, only with HTML, as far as I can figure. 
What happens is that it is possible to introduce strange things into the source of HTML, and Amaya corrects the markup when synchronising. 
Does this match what you were doing? 
(And do you have a sample file or more details?) cheers Chaals SWAD-E http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe ------------ WAI http://www.w3.org/WAI W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France In article Pine.LNX.4.30.0209231751420.25011-100000@tux.w3.org , I don't know whether the interesting problems I have been having with documents originated elsewhere - for revision to current standards. 
The document I have been playing with is at which claims to be HTML 3.2 - but isn't. 
I loaded into Amaya 6.4 (linux GTK version) and tried some simple editing - but Amaya kept indicating that anywhere I wished to select was - Graphics\area\map\td\tr\tbody\table\center\body\html\Document and would not let me select it. 
I thought to try and save it locally which Amaya did - but didn't raise a protest either then or on an attempt to reload it - that is all I can do apart from viewing many red marks on the structure view and several lines in the parsing errors. 
Might this be a related problem?? Keith Hopper Keith Hopper Senior Lecturer Department of Computer Science University of Waikato, NZ On Mon, 23 Sep 2002 13:44:26 -0700 Amaya is tolerant with HTML documents so you can load and save invalid HTML documents. 
The part generated by Amaya is valid but if there is an invalid element or attribute in the loaded document it's not automatically removed. 
Amaya checks the validity of XHTML documents. 
To be sure to produce valid documents you have to save it in XHTML. 
Irene.
