<s> Summary: I doubt you can make clearer tests of this issue than the one peter proposes - in particular Jan's proposed test is incorrect.  </s>
<s> while sympathetic to Jan's desire for meangingful test cases, I note that peter's test (particualrly the choice of conclusion) depends on a somewhat non-obvious technicality.  </s>
<s> false does-not-simply-entail G for any non-empty G, because G uses at least one URI which is not in all interpretations of false.  </s>
<s> Thus the test case needs to show an inconsistency, followed by garbage using the same vocab as the premise (or the central RDF vocabulary).  </s>
<s> (And we have rdf-entailment), ditto rdfs entailment).  </s>
<s> Peter's choice of garbage out rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type seems to be about as best as you can do to have obvious garabge given the constraint Jeremy  </s>
<s> if E is a ground triple s p o .  </s>
<s> then I(E) = true if s, p and o are in V, I(p) is in IP and I(s),I(o) is in IEXT(I(p)) otherwise I(E)= false.  </s>

<s> conditions for blank nodes are ok too; G comes out false under an interpretation which doesn't contain a URI in G. jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.  </s>

<s> No, it does.  </s>
<s> A entails B means (forall interpretations I (if I satisfies A then I satisfies B)) so if A is false then this is always trivially true; so false entails anything, no matter what vocabulary it uses.  </s>
