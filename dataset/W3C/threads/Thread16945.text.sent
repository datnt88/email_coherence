Hello all, I have a rather interesting question to pose, and it is one that I cannot seem to find a definitive answer for. 
Can anyone on the list provide me with some help with the following question? 
Which is best for accessibility: HTML 4.x or XHTML standards? 
IF anyone knows if there is an answer to this then is it also possible to scour everyone's brains for reasons why one is preferred above another.

my answers are never very authoritative, however i imagine that in an ideal world xhtml will be more accessible, as xml is the future, and xhtml is a step in the direction of xml. 
My most serious concern regarding xhtml, and xml (and this future), is that code that has errors will not be rendered, try amaya. 
This is bl*** awful for anyone with dyslexia, learning difficulties, DTs, typos or other problems, as most would I think prefer some page rather than no page.

If it is not rendered, it would seem the author would know before nnouncing it to the world.

Why? 
The author may be using some AT which corrects for errors, either as a deliberate useful activity (after all users are not interested in if a page has errors they're interested in viewing the content.) or as an aside to solving a different access need. 
I don't believe there's any option but to use html 4.01, xhtml of any flavour should be served as application/xhtml+xml and only 1 flavour may be served as text/html and even then it remains broken to many user agents. 
Jim.
