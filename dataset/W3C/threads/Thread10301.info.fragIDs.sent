<s> Dave Summary: reject The comment raised in in the depths of section 4.4 As regards the approach taken to defining the syntax, in our view, layering of specs has very high value, and so defining an XML document type by way of what is very nearly a character-level BNF is at best a missed opportunity and at worst a serious mistake.  </s>
<s> It obscures the important aspects of the document type behind a welter of irrelevant detail about e.g. whitespace and start-tag/end-tag matching.  </s>
<s> It makes it very difficult for the reader to actually understand what is and isn't actually allowed -- what an RDF/XML document actually looks like.  </s>
<s> Not only does this confuse levels and thus readers, it also runs the risk of inadvertently defining an XML subset.  </s>
<s> It also appears, on a strict reading, to rule out XML documents not derived from the parsing of character streams as possible RDF/XML (so that it would be illegitimate to regard a data structure created using a DOM interface, for example, as RDF/XML).  </s>
<s> The use of event-triggered data-model construction actions to specify the relationship between XML representation and corresponding data objects is innovative and compelling, but surely it would be straight-forward to associate these events with a pre-order traversal of an infoset independently constrained by a DTD, XML Schema schema or other appropriate definition of the canonical document type.  </s>
<s> If continued support for alternative forms is considered essential, then a two-step approach where the semantics of any non-canonical form is defined in terms of a canonical form to which it corresponds would still be far simpler than the current approach.  </s>
<s> The RDF Core WG has considered your last call comment captured in (raised in section "4.4.  </s>

<s> The main points you raised in this comment are: 1) RDF/XML is defined in "what is very nearly a character-level BNF [which] is at best a missed opportunity and at worst a serious mistake." - obscuring important parts of the document type - making it very difficult for the reader to actually understand what is and isn't actually allowed.  </s>
<s> - confusing layers RDF/XML is entirely layered on the XML Infoset as defined in Syntax Data Model and is not defined at the character-level.  </s>
<s> All XML detail is handled by the XML specifications, not this document - deployed RDF/XML applications are entirely built on standard XML tools.  </s>
<s> In layering on the XML infoset, we leave only the important parts of RDF/XML that users and application writers need be concerned about - elements, attributes, whitespace and text.  </s>
<s> It would have been a mistake to gloss over where, say, the whitespace was significant and where it was ignored - which was one problem with the original RDF M&amp;S specification.  </s>
<s> 2) Rules out XML documents not parsed from character streams (such as DOM) This was explicitly called out: This model illustrates one way to create a representation of an RDF Graph from an RDF/XML document.  </s>
<s> It does not mandate any implementation method - any other method that results in a representation of the same RDF Graph may be used.  </s>
<s> In particular: * This specification does not require the use of [XPATH] or [SAX2] If a DOM interface can provide the very few (4) XML Infoset Infoitems that are needed here, it is not ruled out.  </s>
