<s> An Experimental Implementation of SimpleMD5 Simpmd5 is a server side implementation of the proposed SimpleMD5 authentication method for HTTP.  </s>
<s> The current specification for the proposal can be found at This specification describes an addition to the HTTP protocol to allow authentication in a way that does not send passwords over the network unencrypted.  </s>
<s> It is intended as a replacement for Basic authentication.  </s>
<s> At present no publically available clients support it.  </s>
<s> The SimpleMD5 protocol has several important advantages in addition to transmitting only encrypted passwords.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> It is simple, maybe even easier to implement than Basic authentication.  </s>
<s> 2. It is very limited in its goals.  </s>
<s> It has no connection with any of the competing security protocols (Shen, S-HTTP, SSL).  </s>
<s> This means clients can introduce it as a replacement for Basic authentication only.  </s>
<s> No commitment to one of the security protocols is implied and it is not necessary to wait for security standards to emerge before implementing it.  </s>
<s> 3. It is flexible.  </s>
<s> It allows for added features in the server (see below for examples).  </s>
<s> Simpmd5 is an experimental implementation of SimpleMD5 intended for use as an authentication module with the WN http server (see program in which case it will do two things: a) generate a server SimpleMD5 request for authentication or b) consult the enviroment variable HTTP_AUTHORIZATION, parse a client Authorization line there, consult a password file and return a string indicating acceptance or rejection.  </s>
<s> This implementation has two interesting features which are not part of the specification but are made possible by the flexibility of the proposed method.  </s>
<s> 1. Timestamps: The maintainer can set the time period for which authentication granted the client is valid.  </s>
<s> After this time period the client will have to re-authenticate.  </s>
<s> The time period can be set to any number of seconds (or be unlimited) and is accurate to within 1% of the specified value.  </s>
<s> The timestamp is encoded in the "opaque" header field (see the specification).  </s>
<s> 2. IP address stamps: The IP address (or the IP address of the client's proxy) is encoded in the "opaque" header field.  </s>
<s> This means that a replay attack would have to spoof the server with a false IP address.  </s>
<s> The simpmd5 program is written in C and the source code is available freely for any use.  </s>
<s> You can obtain it from John Franks john@math.nwu.edu  </s>
<s> The Shen/S-HTTP system also uses timestamps.  </s>
<s> These have the difficulty of clock synchronisation but remove the problem of keeping track of challenge /response pairs which is a problem if the connection cannot be kept open.  </s>
<s> This is especially a problem through gateways.  </s>
<s> How is the IP address of the proxy known?  </s>
<s> Using the IP address is very unsatisfactory since it adds little real security but a lot of inconvenience.  </s>
<s> Also I really don't like having a system that only authenticates the fact that a transaction has been authorised but does not authenticate which particular transaction is authorised.  </s>
<s> Extension of the system to perform a digest of the message header itself is very simple.  </s>
<s> It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks which is very important when using proxies.  </s>
<s> This extension can be achieved in a manner that is very simple and compatible with the S-http scheme.  </s>
<s> Thus implementors only have one scheme to worry about.  </s>
<s> I'm also very against discussing this in the http forum and not the security one.  </s>
<s> A lot of work has gone into unifying the security schemes proposed last year.  </s>
<s> It has always been my beief that they are part of the main HTTP spec.  </s>
<s> In this respect the name S-HTTP is probably misleading.  </s>
<s> Considering the potential problems with turf wars vis a vis various IETF parties we should be very clear that we ensure that security matters are raised on www-security-request@ns1.rutgers.edu.  </s>
<s> They might also be sent to other lists but they MUST definitely be seen in the security list.  </s>
<s> I get over 200 messages a day.  </s>
<s> I don't read all of them.  </s>
<s> The security list is one I do read, as do those doing security work.  </s>
<s> The bottom line is that with the minimal Digest scheme proposed a secure communication can be set up between a browser and a security enhancment proxy.  </s>
<s> I do not bleive that the simpleMD5 scheme offers this level of security unless the actual transaction itself is authenticated.  </s>
<s> Doing this makes the SimpleMD5 scheme effectively the same as the digest scheme.  </s>
<s> In other words the SimpleMD5 scheme is not a security `enhancement', it is a weakening of a scheme already proposed and implemented.  </s>
<s> :-( Moreover this is precisely the point Alan and myself raised against the original SSL scheme at the W3C security meeting.  </s>
<s> One other point, before the unification of Shen/S-HTTP proposals started Shen used the actual header itself for the authentication.  </s>
<s> This was discovered not to work with some proxies that reorganised the header lines :-( so I adopted the S-HTTP approach of having an encapsulated header, MIME style.  </s>
<s> Note however that full S-HTTP mucking arroung with ASN.1 encapsulation is not required!  </s>
<s> The digest scheme specs are avaliable from:- Phill Hallam-Baker  </s>
<s> When I posted the availability of an experimental implementation of SimpleMD5 authentication I neglected to mention that I am running a test version on my server.  </s>
<s> Those of you implementing SimpleMD5 in clients are welcome to test your clients at with the sample username/password pair that is in the SimpleMD5 specification from Spyglass.  </s>
<s> The source for my implementation is freely available for any use at I might also take this opportunity to respond to the criticism of SimpleMD5 posted here by Phil Hallam-Baker.  </s>
<s> As I understand it Phil's criticisms are 1) SimpleMD5 is not as secure as SHTTP, and 2) SimpleMD% is not a subset of SHTTP.  </s>
<s> Both of these are quite true.  </s>
<s> It is also true that SimpleMD5 is not as secure as SSL and not compatibile with it.  </s>
<s> But this really misses the point of SimpleMD5.  </s>
<s> In the fullness of time I hope and expect that security standards will emerge for HTTP and that they will subsequently be implemented in most browsers and servers.  </s>
<s> However, in the meantime Basic authentication, which transmits passwords essentially in the clear, is in widespread use.  </s>
<s> The point of the Spyglass proposal for SimpleMD5 is as a stop-gap measure to replace Basic authentication.  </s>
<s> It is nearly identical to Basic authentication except that passwords are encrypted.  </s>
<s> Of course security can be done better -- and presumably the security working group is doing precisely that.  </s>
<s> But in the meantime it is definitely worth quickly replacing Basic authentication.  </s>
<s> The changes required in the protocol are absolutely minimal.  </s>
<s> There need to be extra fields in one of the existing authentication header lines from the server and one from the client.  </s>
<s> Implementation for clients should actually be easier than Basic authentication.  </s>
<s> Implementation for the server is not at all difficult.  </s>
<s> One suggestion of Hallam-Baker I think is a very good one and I hope it will be considered before the SimpleMD5 specification is finalized.  </s>
<s> That is to authenticate the specific transaction rather than just all transactions within a realm.  </s>
<s> In practice this means requiring the client to encrypt the URI requested along with the "nonce" and user password.  </s>
<s> The added security is probably marginal but still worthwhile since it is trivial to implement.  </s>

<s> 4) We get something out fast enough that it can be included in HTTP/1.1  </s>
<s> In this connection, the www-security list may be the correct forum to talk about the security aspects.  </s>

<s> Oh all right!  </s>
<s> :-) Readers of www-security:  </s>
<s> A discussion of a new authentication scheme for HTTP has broken out.  </s>
<s> We here at Spyglass have proposed a digest scheme based on MD5.  </s>
<s> You may peruse our ideas at:  </s>
<s> SimpleMD5 has been implemented in our client and in 2 servers, and works nicely as specified.  </s>
<s> Philip Hallam-Baker does not share our enthusiasm for our proposal, and has suggested something totally distinct but similar, the details of which are at: The Digest scheme has apparently also been implemented, as the code for it is available linked to the above page.  </s>
<s> Philip apparently recently posted the following list of priorities, all of which I agree with:  </s>
<s> 1) We authenticate the message body 2) All things being equal we make it as compatible with S-HTTP as possible 3) The discussion of a security scheme for the Web take place on the mailing list the IETF has been told is the official forum for such schemes.  </s>
<s> 4) We get something out fast enough that it can be included in HTTP/1.1  </s>
<s> and, giving the horse yet another kick, I add 5) Make the scheme as SIMPLE as possible, leaving the meatier issues to S-HTTP discussions.  </s>
<s> There is every reason to move toward consensus.  </s>
<s> Perhaps, through discussion with the readers of www-security, we can locate the appopriate blend of Philip's ideas and ours?  </s>
