Just don't use the editor operations if you don't want to.

We never experimented the building of Amaya without editing functions, but it should work. 
You need to remove a large majority of functions declared in EDITOR.A (all menu entries disabled by the browser mode). 
Normally functions located within EDITORactions.c, HTMLedit.c, 
EDITimage.c, 
HTMLpresentation.c, HTMLbook.c could be removed. 
Regards Irene. 
Amaya *is* an editor with some browsing capabilities, not a browser with some editing capabilities! 
If you want to browse valid, well written, pure HTML, I'd suggest Lynx. 
If you want to browse real life broken HTML with shockwave/javascript/vbscript/java/frames without fallback text,....., I'd suggest IE5, although if you are not on Windows or Solaris, maybe Netscape 4, upgrading to NS5 as soon as it is realeased.
