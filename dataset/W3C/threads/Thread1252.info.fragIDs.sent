Hello Makoto, 
The uri above may have some problems because it doesn't exist at the moment, you don't have a guarantee that w3c will create it for you, and w3c would not guarantee that it's content doesn't change. 
I suggest that you proceed as follows: 1) you resubmit the Japanese XML profile to w3c and wait until it is published 2) you use the dated version corresponding to the above uri in your registration Regards, Martin.
