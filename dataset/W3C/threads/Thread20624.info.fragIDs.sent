<s> Hello, I am just descovering Amaya today and find it has some very goog features.  </s>
<s> I was nevertheless astonished that some sites show bad, for example mostly because of difficulties with frames.  </s>
<s> I did look at the archives of this list to find some information: I found ideas about the sens of framing, no hint that frames are not welcome to this browser.  </s>
<s> Secondly: while browsing, I prefer helvetica fonts to times fonts.  </s>
<s> Is there any way to change the setting?  </s>
<s> I did not find any.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Reto Hadorn S I D O S (Swiss information and data archive service for the social sciences) Ruelle Vaucher 13 CH -2000 Neuch?tel Suisse / Switzerland Reto.Hadorn@sidos.unine.ch  </s>
<s> Yes you can change that by defining your User CSS style sheet.  </s>
<s> It's the file amaya.css  </s>
<s> located in your AmayaHome Directory (see Help/Configuring to know where is this directory in your platform).  </s>
<s> Mine amaya.css  </s>
<s> file contains: @media print { BODY {font-size: 10pt} @media screen { BODY {font-family: Helvetica} Irene.  </s>
<s> Is the AmayaHome directory not created automatically on installation?  </s>
<s> At least, under Win NT I have neither c:\winnt\profiles\username\amaya nor amaya.css.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Dennis Kibbe  </s>
