<s> I will try to, but 8am Pacific time is quite early for me and I have to participate from home, which has functional limitations for me.  </s>
<s> On a past conference call, I mentioned that 9am was the earliest I could go and then it was decided that 8am was going to be the time for the weekly calls.  </s>
<s> Because of this, I cannot commit to the calls, only to say that I will try to participate.  </s>
<s> It's also a shame that more technical work isn't done at the Face2Face meetings.  </s>
<s> In my past experience working with standards organizations, the Face2Face meetings are where all the technical issues are worked on.  </s>
<s> There seemed to be an aversion to such at the Peterborough meetings, where I was told more than once to take a technical issue to the lists.  </s>
