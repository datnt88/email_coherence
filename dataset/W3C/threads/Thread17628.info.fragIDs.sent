I will try to, but 8am Pacific time is quite early for me and I have to participate from home, which has functional limitations for me. 
On a past conference call, I mentioned that 9am was the earliest I could go and then it was decided that 8am was going to be the time for the weekly calls. 
Because of this, I cannot commit to the calls, only to say that I will try to participate. 
It's also a shame that more technical work isn't done at the Face2Face meetings. 
In my past experience working with standards organizations, the Face2Face meetings are where all the technical issues are worked on. 
There seemed to be an aversion to such at the Peterborough meetings, where I was told more than once to take a technical issue to the lists. 
Thanks, -Chuck
