<s> I have received an assignment about research on document object model.  </s>
<s> I haven't still found answers to the following questions:  </s>
<s> 1) Where is DOM used now, and does it have a future?  </s>
<s> 2) Who owns DOM and what does it cost?  </s>
<s> 3) Why should a commercial organization get interested in this technology?  </s>
<s> I would appreciate if you reply to me at your earliest possible as my  </s>

<s> Hi, First take a look at w3.org then I would suggest you do searches on google.  </s>
<s> You will find a large amount of information.  </s>

<s> DOM is used extensively on the web, and it most certainly does have a future!  </s>
<s> Noone owns DOM, as it is not a product.  </s>
<s> As Gareth said, some searches on Google and a look at w3c.org will answer all your questions.  </s>
<s> If they are developing websites I would imagine they are already interested, otherwise I feel that they would have very little interest in it.  </s>

<s> Not just on the web, pretty much anything XML related is likely to use the DOM at some point.  </s>
<s> It's pretty much everywhere you look.  </s>
<s> It'd be quite boring if it were limited to website development, but thankfully it's not and is used all over the place.  </s>
<s> In fact, most commercial entities that have anything to do with XML, even remotely, is almost certainly using the DOM somewhere.  </s>

<s> Start with http://www.w3.org/DOM; lots of documentation there about what the DOM is, why it is, where it's used.  </s>
<s> You could try a websearch, though I expect you'll have trouble cutting it down to a useful size.  </s>
