<s> You mean other people are meant to read this document???  </s>
<s> I'm all ears!  </s>
<s> I think we can rely on the glossary and may have to.  </s>
<s> Not all terms are used the same way, and having a definition that's internally consistent is important and perhaps the only way to ensure that the document as a whole stands up.  </s>
<s> Internal inconstency is a bad thing, however.  </s>

<s> It is always a danger when working on something clsely that you forget how people see it on first meeting.  </s>
<s> But I think that we have made certain assumptions.  </s>
<s> One of them is that there are a few terms we want to define so we can use them, and view is probably one of them.  </s>
<s> Whether we can do that better is of course an open question.  </s>
<s> I think in the specific checkpoint what we want to do is allow navigation between views and/or viewports (such as frames or multiple windows).  </s>
<s> Charles McCN (probably the greatest offender in the Pontificating stakes, for which I'm sorry)  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I've fixed this.  </s>
<s> I went through the whole spec and tried to ensure consistency.  </s>
<s> There may still be bugs and I hope you will find them and point them out.  </s>
<s> I almost agree.  </s>
<s> However, there are some terms that are used differently in different contexts or by different communities, including words like "element", which may have a technical meaning (e.g., SGML) and common parlance meaning (component).  </s>
<s> We need a glossary to ensure that readers understand what we mean.  </s>
<s> Internal consistency is crucial and I hope you will point out inconsistencies you find.  </s>
<s> I am all for the clearest language possible (and to avoid jargon where we can).  </s>
<s> If you can propose other language you feel is clearer, please don't hesitate.  </s>
<s> Just an historical note: "viewport" comes from the CSS2 specification [1]: 9.1.1  </s>
<s> The viewport User agents for continuous media generally offer users a viewport (a window or other viewing area on the screen) through which users consult a document.  </s>
<s> User agents may change the document's layout when the viewport is resized (see the initial containing block).  </s>
<s> When the viewport is smaller than the document's initial containing block, the user agent should offer a scrolling mechanism.  </s>
<s> There is at most one viewport per canvas, but user agents may render to more than one canvas (i.e., provide different views of the same document).  </s>
