<s> B.10 What form should EMPTY elements take, if there are EMPTY elements in XML: e , e/, or e /e (where '/' is assumed the NET string) (7.3, 11.2.3)?  </s>
<s> Only one of these, e /e , can be parsed reliably without a DTD, unles you are prepared to use lookahead to the end of the document or untiul the next close tag of a container.  </s>
<s> Two other possibilities: (1) use a naming convention, e.g. (1b) add something (e.g. @) as a name start character: where all elements starting with @ are EMPTY, by convention.  </s>
<s> An amendment to SGML could allow @ to be a delimiter to start a tag of an EMPTY element, and then the convention would become supported syntax.  </s>
<s> Both of these are using syntax, but are using a kind of syntax for which there is precedent.  </s>
<s> I don't have strong feelings on these, but wanted to raise them since they are both compatible with SGML as it stands today.  </s>

<s> Another couple of possibilities:  </s>
<s> (2) provide the necessary markup declarations in a "partial DTD" so that empty elements can be understood:  </s>
<s> (2b) provide the necessary "instance parameters" rather than whole markup declarations (which generally provide more info than is needed for read-only processing functions): These relate to B.2, required vs. optional DTDs.  </s>
<s> I find the idea of  </s>
<s> partial DTDs really appealing, since you don't have to create redundant PIs (which could possibly get out of sync with the original DTD), but also find the PI idea appealing because certain kinds of markup declarations contain a lot of overkill info.  </s>
<s> I prefer both of these over the naming convention ideas because the latter mess up the user's available GI namespace.  </s>
<s> If supplying instance parameter in whatever form is a possibility, then there's no reason to ban EMPTY elements (which are quite popular in many DTDs today) from XML, and we can gracefully do away with the need to supply the extra info if SGML97 starts allowing the end-tag.  </s>

<s> Requiring partial DTDs is the first step on the slope to requiring DTDs and greatly complicating XML for everyone.  </s>
<s> How will validating XML parsers distinguish between partial DTDs and full DTDs?  </s>
<s> How will authors know the difference?  </s>
<s> Having said that, this approach has merit and I'm undecided on the best way to handle empt elements - other than to say it should be simple, easily understood, and accpetable to the masses.  </s>
<s> I don't think full DTDs ever *need* to be required; pretty much all the "read-only" applications (such as browsers) would do just fine if they had the tiny subset of information that includes, e.g., EMPTY elements.  </s>
<s> You make a really good point about distinguishing partial and full DTDs.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a PI such as ?XML partialdtd is a good way to handle this; otherwise the DTD would be assumed to be full, and the instance could generate some errors accordingly if some declarations are missing.  </s>

<s> Sign me up with Eve on (2) - this has the advantages that it's easy to explain, easy to parse, and is consistent with both SGML and HTML thinking.  </s>
<s> 2b - please, not another syntax for doing the same thing... whether we use DSD or DTD, let's use one thing throughout.  </s>
<s> The difficulty of parsing (2) as opposed to (2b) is nowhere near greater enough to justify getting into another syntax.  </s>

<s> Another way would be to say that XML doesn't require full DTDs.  </s>
<s> Period.  </s>
<s> Without any way to say whether a DTD is full or partial.  </s>
<s> Basically, the application can opt to make whatever use it wants of whatever DTDs it's given.  </s>
<s> If the application comes across an element for which there is no declaration in the DTD, it does whatever it is able to do rather than necessarily issuing an error message.  </s>
<s> This way, someone could send what they think is a "full" DTD, an then if there is an extra element, the application could still work.  </s>
<s> Better yet, if the user of the application decides to extend the language (the one that is defined in the DTD that exists) and add a new element, they can do that if the application supports that.  </s>
<s> If we require that all DTDs be marked as full or partial, then what was a full DTD given one version of the instance can't automatically become a partial DTD for an extended version of the instance.  </s>
<s> That is, for XML, all DTDs become "possibly partial" where both an omitted DTD and a full DTD are just 'degenerate' cases.  </s>
<s> Tying this back to empty elements, if the instance uses no empty elements, a read-only application may well be able to get away with no DTD.  </s>
<s> If there are empty elements, perhaps only those declarations need to be included and sent in the partial DTD.  </s>
