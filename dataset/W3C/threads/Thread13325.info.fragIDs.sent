<s> I took an action item to write a proposed introduction to the document under discussion at the last teleconference.  </s>
<s> The document seems to be unavailable but here's a crude try at a first draft: EVALUATION AND REPAIR TOOL TIPS  </s>
<s> The WAI has produced a foundation Recommendation, the WCAG, upon which are based working drafts of what it is hoped will become further Recommendations: one for User Agents; another for Authoring Tools.  </s>
<s> These documents try to make clear the parameters essential to a Web that enables "everything, everyone connected", especially Persons With Disabilities.  </s>
<s> In order for an author or user of materials on the Web to determine if a particular site is likely to be accesible to PWDs, it is important to have some functional, friendly, and free tools for site evaluation and, if possible, repair of problems that may be uncovered.  </s>
<s> To this end we are developing guidelines for such Evaluation &amp; Repair Tools - sort of "Guidelines for the Guidelines."  </s>
<s> Although these are meant to be used by those who would create tools, they may prove useful to anyone interested in an accessible Web.  </s>
<s> The most important aspect of any such tools is that they be themselves accessible.  </s>
<s> Since many people trying to use them will be fairly new to technological matters they should be pleasant to use, not condescending in tone, and avoid the "cry wolf" syndrome.  </s>
<s> It is clear that only a limited set of the checkpoints may be objectively tested by a tool.  </s>
<s> there will be much dependence on the user's ability to use common sense to determine conformance to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> To this end it is imperative that any tool have features that assist in reminding, without nagging; in helping, without demeaning; in suggesting, without demanding.  </s>
<s> A fairly comprehensive listing of available tools may be found at: lists.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> William, I like your intro.  </s>
<s> Here's my suggested changes:  </s>
<s> The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) produced a foundation document, The WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, that describes what must be done to make an HTML page accessible to all.  </s>
<s> Two working draft recommendation papers were produced, based on these WAI guidelines; one for user agents; another for authoring tools.  </s>
<s> The draft recommendation papers try to make clear that the WWW should enable everyone, especially those with disabilities.  </s>
<s> To determine if a web site is accessible to everyone, it is important to have functional, friendly and free tools for site evaluation and, if possible, repair of problems that may be uncovered.  </s>
<s> This document describes techniques that may be used by such 'evaluation and repair' tools to uncover accessibility problems and possibly repair them.  </s>
<s> These guidelines may be used by those who create web authoring tools or to anyone interested in creating accessible web documents.  </s>
<s> It is important that evaluation and repair tools themselves be accessible.  </s>
<s> Many people using these tools may be new to this technology and will require software programs that are easy to use while not condescending in tone.  </s>
<s> Is also important that the evaluation tool does not generate excessive warnings or false positive accessibility errors to avoid the 'cry wolf' syndrome.  </s>
<s> It is clear that only a limited set of the WAI Guideline's checkpoints may be objectively tested by a software tool.  </s>
<s> There will still be a dependence on the user's ability to use common sense to determine conformance to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is imperative that any tool have features that assist in reminding, without nagging; in helping, without demeaning; in suggesting, without demanding.  </s>
<s> We hope that the techniques in this document, implemented in software programs, will gently guide authors along the path to more accessible documents.  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> Thanks to Chris for the comments on the proposed intro.  </s>
<s> I endorse the modifications and wonder if anyone has any tersification proposals or other comments.  </s>
<s> I do believe the document will benefit from some such introduction.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
