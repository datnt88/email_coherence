<s> I believe it's soon time to release Link Checker 3.9.3.  </s>
<s> The only  </s>
<s> showstopper (unless I've missed something) is the presentation of the "forbidden by robots.txt"  </s>
<s> cases, which are now treated as 403's, with  </s>
<s> screaming red background.  </s>
<s> So apart from that, for all your urgent link checking needs, this one could use some testing: http://qa-dev.w3.org/wlc/checklink :)  </s>
<s> Ville,  </s>
<s> Great!  </s>
<s> Are you planning a short beta test soon?  </s>
<s> I haven't had time to test it  </s>
<s> yet, but I went through the diff and things look good.  </s>
<s> I will try to play with it within a few days, tell me how you'd like to schedule the  </s>
<s> next steps.  </s>
<s> olivier  </s>
<s> I'll try to get the robots-text-is-screaming-red-403 issue fixed in the weekend, after that we could do a quick beta test.  </s>
<s> But nothing prevents  </s>
<s> from testing already now, because about all the real functional changes for 3.9.3 are already in as far as I'm concerned.  </s>
<s> The status of libwww-perl needs attention though, I believe the link checker $TNV *could* in theory work with the 5.64 on v.w.o, 5.66+ is  </s>
<s> needed for command line use.  </s>
<s> But perhaps the upgrade to 5.79 would not be a bad idea.  </s>
<s> I've notified the Debian libwww-perl maintainer about the 5.76 file: redirect issue, perhaps there will be an updated .deb  </s>
<s> available soon.  </s>
<s> Fedora Core 2 will most likely include 5.79 (it's in Rawhide now).  </s>
<s> Haven't got time to look yet but I suppose from what you're saying that  </s>
<s> 5.79 fixes the file: redirect bug, which is good.  </s>
<s> That said, are we sure it's a good candidate (i.e stable enough) to put into production?  </s>
<s> I realize that updating lwp is starting to be important and urgent, I just would not want to regret any hasty move.  </s>
<s> olivier  </s>
<s> Understood and agreed.  </s>
<s> But all the development work I'm doing is with 5.79 (and I've reviewed quite a bit of the current LWP codebase lately,  </s>
<s> it should be in good shape), qa-dev currently has 5.76 and v.w.o has 5.64.  </s>
<s> As long as the production version will be using something that we test 3.9.3 with, it's fine with me.  </s>
<s> Well, as long as it's newer than 5.60, excluding 5.76 ;) Updating the system LWP on v.w.o would of course need the validator to be tested with the new one as well.  </s>
<s> But if need be, one or even both of {validator,checklink} can be using their "own" LWP installation, basically it's just a matter of unpacking the LWP dist tarball, doing a SetEnv to the libwww-perl-*/lib dir in Apache's config for the relevant script, and removing the -T flag from the CGI's perl shebang.  </s>
<s> Note, I'm not advocating this, just pointing it out as a possibility just in case...  </s>
<s> Ok, this is now done (although the implementation is somewhat ugly), and ready for a beta test now.  </s>
<s> Hi Ville, All,  </s>
<s> I have just installed LWP 5.79 on qa-dev.  </s>
<s> Maybe we can check for a day or two whether that causes no problem with either the validator or checklink, and proceed with a beta (with 5.79 installed on w.v.o) within a couple days?  </s>
<s> I just tested the new feature (and style for the robots exclusion) and it seems to work fine, great job.  </s>
<s> I still find it frustrating that the link checker HAS to follow robots.txt  </s>
<s> and telling users to check links manually, even in non recursive mode, but I reckon I am against the majority here, and I should probably just accept I am wrong and shut up ;)  </s>
<s> olivier  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> FWIW, I am not a huge fan of it either.  </s>
<s> A doc snippet (and a pointer to it from the "forbidden by robots.txt"  </s>
<s> explanation) how to allow the link checker in /robots.txt would probably be a good idea, I'll look into it.  </s>
