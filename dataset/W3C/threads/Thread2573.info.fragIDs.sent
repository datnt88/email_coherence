<s> [I forget whether you're open to such questions now.  </s>
<s> I presume someone will tell me if not.]  </s>
<s> I just fetched rev-02.  </s>
<s> Let me ask a question that's been bothering me for quite a while now.  </s>
<s> In section 1.4, HTTP is defined wrt a request/response pair propagating along a chain of intermediaries (not just proxies).  </s>
<s> That seems too specific in multiple ways; let me focus here on the chain part.  </s>
<s> Why a chain?  </s>
<s> I understand the need for a distinction between hop-by-hop and end-to-end headers; I'm just concerned that the definition of "end-to-end" is a bit too specialized.  </s>
<s> In particular, the restriction to the chain shape seems spurrious.  </s>
<s> Surely there are reasons for constructing non-chain shapes.  </s>
<s> And I suspect the HTTP protocol doesn't need (or perhaps could easily be made to not need) the restriction to chain shapes.  </s>
<s> Let me illustrate my question by asking for an analysis of the following situation.  </s>
<s> Consider a rendering server whose job is to accept GET requests for arbitrary URIs and always respond with entities whose MIME type is some compressed bitmap type suitable for quick blasting onto a TV screen.  </s>
<s> When asked to GET a URI, this server acts as a client to GET both the requested URI and any inlined images, then renders them all together to create the compressed bitmap response.  </s>
<s> This is a non-chain shape: a request into a server causes multiple requests to go out of that server.  </s>
<s> Among the questions I wonder about are: (1) is it fair to say this server is an "HTTP/1.1 server"?  </s>
<s> (2) is this  </s>
<s> server an "HTTP/1.1 proxy"?  </s>
<s> (3) what happens with the Last-Modified headers in the responses?  </s>
<s> (4) whose job is it (HTTP/1.1's? the intermediary's vendor's?) to define what happens with the Last-Modified headers in the responses?  </s>
<s> (5) What is the "origin server" for the request submitted to this rendering server?  </s>
<s> It certainly could be.  </s>
<s> (2) is this server an "HTTP/1.1 proxy"?  </s>
<s> No. It is originating the response - I suppose that one could characterize this as an HTTP-to-HTTP (H2H) gateway if the sources of the composite image were obtained using HTTP, but that is essentially irrelevant - no other server has the response that is being sent to the user agent, so it is not acting as a proxy for another server.  </s>
<s> (3) what happens with the Last-Modified headers in the responses?  </s>
<s> If I were creating such a thing, I would set the cache validators (both L-M and Etag) such that they reflected the state of the composite; L-M to the most recent L-M of the components, and the Etag some composite of the Etag values for the components.  </s>
<s> It feels to me that this hypothetical program is neither an HTTP Server (though it has such characteristics) nor Proxy ... rather it is an HTTP client or application.  </s>
<s> That it happens to also be an HTTP server in the vague sense that it uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with its partner in delivering the application is sort of moot in terms of analyzing how the HTTP specification applies.  </s>
<s> The composite of this application and its set-top partner forms what we have generally refered to as a user-agent.  </s>
<s> Looking then to the HTTP protocol for guidance as to how to impelement the application connection, I think Scott's suggestions match what I would have suggested, assuming the desire to leave responsiblity for tracking changes with the set-top end of the partnership.  </s>
<s> Reality however is that for the rendering half of the partner ship to correctly respond in the network optimum fashion, it needs to check each of the pieces which formed the rendered composite with the origin servers, etc.  </s>
<s> The only really useful thing the settop client could make use of would be a computed composite expires value which was the earliest of any of the original expires.  </s>
<s> This expires value would represent when it was necessary for the settop part to ask the rendering part to check the individual components.  </s>
<s> Knowledge which the rendering component has about the composition of the object returned to the set-top part would allow it to check the status of which ever components had actually expired.  </s>
