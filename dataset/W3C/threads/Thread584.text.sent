Just trying to get my docs to pass the XHTML 1.0 validation. 
One part of a JavaScript is tripping it up twice (one for each &amp;) { if ((typeof window.sidebar 
== "object") &amp;&amp; Error: character "&amp;" is the first character of a delimiter but occurred as data Is there anything I can do manually or via Tidy to change this? 
Ian Evans Chairman &amp; Executive Producer Digital Hit Entertainment Where feasible the easiest way to handle Javascript code is to move it to a separate file. 
Otherwise place the whole script in a CDATA section. 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Greetings, Is your script enclosed in comment marks to avoid entity expansion?

ICQ:19002710 ************* apt-get a life I noticed that shortly after I wrote the email. 
BTW, I had tried using the CDATA tags around the scripts before but I was getting JavaScript errors in the browser. 
This is not feasible for XHTML documents. 
XML Parsers may strip any comment from a source document.

When Dave asked how to deal with this issue, I responded !-- -- ![CDATA[ / !-- // script data without ]] goes here // -- ! 
]] would be a working and conformant method to 'escape' script data. 
Since I got no reply, i try it now again :-) And as I'm here, I ask you, Dave, again, to add the german translation of XHTML 1.0 to http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann ^ mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de ^ http://www.bjoernsworld.de am Badedeich 7 ?
