<s> Here is a summary of the discussion at the February 26 2003 Techniques teleconference.  </s>
<s> Reminder: There will be no meeting on March 5 due to the Technical Plenary.  </s>
<s> We will resume on March 12.  </s>
<s> We began by continuing the discussion of text equivalents in HTML, and proposed a possible way to recommend use of "alt", "title", and "longdesc":  </s>
<s> * "alt" is a mandatory text equivalent for img that should always be present  </s>
<s> * "title" is supplementary textual information on most elements  </s>
<s> * "longdesc" is preferred over "title" as supplemental text equivalent for img (i.e., we don't recommend "title" for img although it is generally recommended elsewhere)  </s>
<s> There are User Agent issues with "alt" and "title" used together that need  </s>
<s> further exploration and may affect the recommendations presented above.  </s>
<s> Next we discussed definitions of "long documents" and "major sections" from the guidelines: * We need these terms to be defined in WCAG * General discussion of what they could mean, and examples of difficulties in arriving at a general meaning * Considered how and when paragraphs, headings, and lists should be used to meet these requirements * Propose that "content" replace "document" since "document" is very hard to define We tabled other agenda items.  </s>
<s> Action Item: Everyone - Look for examples of sites that do and do not organize themselves into "major sections" and keep themselves from being "long documents".  </s>
<s> In the meeting we considered Yahoo, Amazon, and EBay, it  </s>
<s> was quite instructive.  </s>
<s> It would be good to review sites from different industries.  </s>

<s> Note that img is not the only HTML entity that can refer to an image.  </s>
<s> Think also of input and button, and of course object.  </s>
<s> Reasons, please?  </s>
<s> An enormous range of user agents support title, including nearly every browser in use in the last three years save for Netscape 4 and currently-released builds of Safari.  </s>
<s> Lynx even supports title on certain elements.  </s>
<s> Virtually no user agents support longdesc, though, IIRC, both the leading screen readers, iCab, and Mozilla/NN7 do.  </s>
<s> title is very easy to add, almost trivially so.  </s>
<s> Authors who like title (and this includes a great many indie Web developers) put titles on everything.  </s>
<s> longdesc requires the creation of a separate document, which is then called by the longdesc attribute.  </s>
<s> Few authoring tools make adding longdesc easy.  </s>
<s> Moreover, the *need* for that much writingspace-- longdesc is essentially unlimited-- is actually rare.  </s>
<s> I would wager that *most* images used online-- *most*-- can be adequately rendered in text equivalents using alt and title.  </s>
<s> Few indeed require longdesc.  </s>
<s> WAI has an inexplicable bias against title, no doubt because it can be used virtually anywhere in HTML, making it Not Really Our Kind of Thing Here-- -- and an inexplicable insistence that longdesc is a really great thing and *what fools those mortals be* for not using it more.  </s>
<s> longdesc isn't a mandatory attribute of img and you can't force people to use it.  </s>
<s> And they are?  </s>
<s> Remember, WCAG 2.0 must not be custom-crafted to work around Jaws incompatibilities, to draw a likely example.  </s>
<s> How can a document that is not "long" have "major sections"?  </s>

<s> But that still leaves some images that require a longer description  </s>
<s> and those images can freely and happily take longdesc.  </s>
<s> readers speak the contents of ALT or TITLE attributes *automatically* (depending on what the individual user chooses for his or her settings).  </s>
<s> Fix the screen readers.  </s>
<s> Don't write WCAG 2.0 to work around the bugs in (inevitably) Jaws, which to this day cannot handle reasonably likely combinations of valid HTML, like img alt="" title="" longdesc="" / or-- heaven help us-- the same HTML inside a title="" /a .  </s>
<s> one another, either-- you get one or the other.  </s>
<s> Which brings me to the longdesc attribute.  </s>
<s> The fact that the longdesc points to another file gives me an option as a user: I can choose to listen to that description or not.  </s>
<s> That's a screen-reader issue.  </s>
<s> It has nothing to do with WCAG 2.0's preferred authoring practices.  </s>
<s> Remember, *the way Jaws screws up Web pages* should not be the basis for writing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> That's from the user's point of view-- at least *this* user's point of view.  </s>
<s> That user's tools are broken.  </s>
<s> Of course, it's what a lot of people are stuck with, but whose problem is that?  </s>
<s> If the developer feels it's essential to present the extended description, the easiest way is simply to put it on the screen as text-- that is, to use the text as part of the page and information design.  </s>
<s> No sighted Web designer would do that, nor should they have to.  </s>
<s> I venture to say that in such cases many users who *don't* have disabilities will benefit from the presence of the extended description.  </s>
<s> Doubtful in the extreme, and more likely to trigger angry complaints.  </s>
<s> Nice touch.  </s>
