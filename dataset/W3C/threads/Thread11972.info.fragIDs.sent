<s> It would make sense to put a description of the tool/suite in that appendix, and to refer to that description as a technique in each instance where it applies.  </s>
<s> Is there a URI for the a-prompt?  </s>

<s> If the pointer to the a-prompt goes into Sample Implementations we will have to change the intro to the section.  </s>

<s> Aprompt is not the answer for everyone, it is a tool for some people (so long as it is only available in windows it is of limited use, and even as a java bean it won't fit into everyone's plans.  </s>
<s> It is however a very good tool for solving some problems, especially repair stuff.  </s>
<s> Another possibility is to give responsibility for listing it to the ER group who are responsible for tools, and point to them in the techniques.  </s>
<s> Certainly it seems useful for a number of techniques - if it is in a 'sample implementations' section (which I see as an appendix of widely applicable techniques - I think that is what William was saying too) we can then put a very short reference to it in specific techniques.  </s>
<s> One of the problems with pushing it too far is that it doesn't necessarily solve all the problems - there is still a bunch of work to be done to integrate it naturally into most authoring tools.  </s>
<s> (On the other hand, it counts as one itself...) That's my 2 cents worth - other folks have thoughts?  </s>
