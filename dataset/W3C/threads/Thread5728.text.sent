Deborah/Frank, The Overview document is looking great and a lot of hard work has paid off in this superb introduction. 
I'd like to offer some very nitpicky editorial suggestions to help polish this off: Abstract, paragraph 2, fourth sentence, "for a more detailed descriptions" to "for more detailed descriptions" Table of Contents, under section 3, missing "10. 
OWL Lite Versioning" Section 1.2, XML Schema bullet doesn't mention the XMLS contribution of datatypes to OWL Section 1.3, bullet 2 on OWL DL, "computed" to "computable" Section 1.3, bullet 2 on OWL DL, "decidability" to "decidable" Section 1.3, 2nd to last paragraph, "provided by OWL DL and OWL Full" to "provided by OWL DL" (sentence is discussing choice between Lite and DL) Section 1.3, last paragraph, last sentence, "OWL DL and OWL Lite" to "OWL DL" (referenced appendix doesn't appear to mention OWL Lite) Section 2.1, third column of constructs gets truncated by most printers, reducing column width of first two columns slightly should solve the problem Section 2.1, move rdfs:subClassOf above rdf:Property for consistency with discussion paragraphs that follow Section 2.1, under Header Information, "ontology" to "Ontology" Section 2.1, appears to be missing discussion of OWL constructs: distinctMembers, ObjectProperty, Nothing, Thing, restriction, onProperty Section 2.1, appears to be missing rdf(s) constructs: List, nil, type, Datatype, Literal Section 2.2, first sentence, "addition to those" to "addition to or expand those" (to cover things like intersectionOf which has already been listed in 2.1 Section 2.2, appears to be missing OWL constructs: AnnotationProperty, OntologyProperty Section 2.2, move complementOf above intersectionOf for consistency in discussion that follows Section 3.1., 
class bullet paragraph, "and a superclass" to "and is a superclass" Section 3.1, class bullet paragraph, "and a subclass" to "and is a subclass" Section 3.1, subClassOf bullet paragraph, "is a Mammal" to "is also a Mammal" Section 3.1, rdfs:domain bullet paragraph, "relates individual" to "relates an individual" Section 3.1, rdfs:domain and rdfs:range bullet paragraphs, "below on local restrictions" to "below on property type restrictions" to match heading Section 3.1, rdfs:range bullet paragraph "i.e., Deborah is the child of Louise," to "(i.e., Deborah is the child of Louise)," Section 3.3., 
transitive property paragraph, extra carriage return exists after "ancestor)." Section 3.4, title, "Restriction" to "Restrictions" for consistency with table of contents Section 3.7, title, "Datatypes" to "OWL Datatypes" for consistency with table of contents Section 4., title, "FULL" to "Full" References, OWL Test citation, "9" to "15" in date Sorry if these are too nit picky, just trying to help! Lee thank you for your very thorough reading and for the useful comments. 
I wanted to acknowledge that we received the comments and I am integrating them. 
I will send another message when my update based on your comments is complete. 
The editors draft at the normal place - has the work in progress.

they are now in the editors draft version along with responses to all other comments I have received since the last revision. 
The editors draft location is the normal one - individual responses to lee lacy's comments are included below. 
a summary is in the change log since proposed recommendation. 
Thanks to all for comments but thanks in particular to lee lacy. 
Abstract, paragraph 2, fourth sentence, "for a more detailed descriptions" to "for more detailed descriptions" done Table of Contents, under section 3, missing "10. 
OWL Lite Versioning" done Section 1.2, XML Schema bullet doesn't mention the XMLS contribution of datatypes to OWL is it fair to say "XML Schema http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema is a language for restricting the structure of XML documents and also extends XML with datatypes" Section 1.3, bullet 2 on OWL DL, "computed" to "computable" done Section 1.3, bullet 2 on OWL DL, "decidability" to "decidable" not done - without the parentheticals - this would be changing ...while retaining computational completeness and decidability ... to while retaining computational completeness and decidable..... Section 1.3, 2nd to last paragraph, "provided by OWL DL and OWL Full" to "provided by OWL DL" (sentence is discussing choice between Lite and DL) done Section 1.3, last paragraph, last sentence, "OWL DL and OWL Lite" to "OWL DL" (referenced appendix doesn't appear to mention OWL Lite) the same restrictions apply in owl lite thus the appendix does actually discuss OWL Lite although it would be useful to make it more explicit in the reference appendix. 
No change to the overview. 
Section 2.1, third column of constructs gets truncated by most printers, reducing column width of first two columns slightly should solve the problem changed cell spacing from 30 to 27 Section 2.1, move rdfs:subClassOf above rdf:Property for consistency with discussion paragraphs that follow done Section 2.1, under Header Information, "ontology" to "Ontology" done Section 2.1, appears to be missing discussion of OWL constructs: distinctMembers, done ObjectProperty, done Nothing, Thing, done restriction, onProperty done Section 2.1, appears to be missing rdf(s) constructs: List, nil, type, Datatype, Literal 2.1 just points to the guide for information on datatype, literal, etc. the pointing has been made more precise. 
Section 2.2, first sentence, "addition to those" to "addition to or expand those" (to cover things like intersectionOf which has already been listed in 2.1 done Section 2.2, appears to be missing OWL constructs: AnnotationProperty, OntologyProperty done (note the guide dated dec 15 does not mention ontology property) Section 2.2, move complementOf above intersectionOf for consistency in discussion that follows done Section 3.1., 
class bullet paragraph, "and a superclass" to "and is a superclass" done Section 3.1, subClassOf bullet paragraph, "is a Mammal" to "is also a Mammal" done Section 3.1, rdfs:domain bullet paragraph, "relates individual" to "relates an individual" done Section 3.1, rdfs:domain and rdfs:range bullet paragraphs, "below on local restrictions" to "below on property type restrictions" to match heading done Section 3.1, rdfs:range bullet paragraph "i.e., Deborah is the child of Louise," to "(i.e., Deborah is the child of Louise)," done Section 3.3., 
transitive property paragraph, extra carriage return exists after "ancestor)." this is intentional for break. 
Section 3.4, title, "Restriction" to "Restrictions" for consistency with table of contents done Section 3.7, title, "Datatypes" to "OWL Datatypes" for consistency with table of contents done Section 4., title, "FULL" to "Full" done References, OWL Test citation, "9" to "15" in date done Deborah L.

Thanks for taking the time to consider each of my recommendations. 
I have no issues with any of the resolutions to my suggestions.
