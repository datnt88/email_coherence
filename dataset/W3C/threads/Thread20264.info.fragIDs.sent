<s> Dear Sir, I have downloaded the Amaya source code on a PC (Win 95), but when I try to gunzip and untar the file (gzip, and tar commands available for DOS), all my file names are truncated ( A DOS limitation as it can not deal with file names longer than 8 characters).  </s>
<s> Is it possible for you to zip the entire 2 directories (Amaya, and libwww) into a single zip file?  </s>
<s> I highly recommend using Norton utilities to perform the task.  </s>
<s> The size of the zip file is very comparable against the tar+gzip file.  </s>
<s> Regards, T. Khajepoor  </s>
<s> why don't you just use winzip?  </s>
<s> it works with tarballs.  </s>
