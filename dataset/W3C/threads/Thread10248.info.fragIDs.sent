<s> Are XML Schema datatyping facets meant here?  </s>
<s> If so, then this is outside the scope of RDF datatyping.  </s>
<s> RDF datatyping does not provide mechanisms for defining datatypes, only for denoting datatypes and associating lexical forms with datatypes to unambiguously denote a datatype value.  </s>
<s> How a given datatype is defined, e.g. whether it is with XML Schema or some other framework, is irrelevant to RDF.  </s>
<s> NO. Definitely not.  </s>
<s> If a datatype defines canonical forms, fine, but RDF Datatyping does not require them.  </s>
<s> They are insignificant to the the semantics and therefore such a requirement would not be justified and would preclude the use of datatypes with RDF which do not define canonical lexical forms.  </s>
<s> This is a datatype specific function completely outside the scope of RDF datatyping and should not be addressed in the RDF specs.  </s>
<s> RDF does not say anything about any particular datatype.  </s>
<s> This is for the XML Schema WG to define, and/or to be addressed in a separate Note addressing XML Schema datatyping issues in RDF.  </s>
