<s> I suggested the addition of content modes to Gudeline 4.1 as a possible way of dealing with the vowel mark problem in Hebrew and Arabic, which was brought to our attention by Lisa Seeman (vowel marks are required to support screen reading in user agents, and for accessibility to people with limited reading ability.) If there is no objection, I would like to see Gudeline 4.1 updated as follows: 4.1 Choose content modes, languages, API's, and protocols that support the use of these guidelines.  </s>
