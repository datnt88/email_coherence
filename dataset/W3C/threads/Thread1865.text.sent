During IETF Orlando I made a presentation to both the Internet Print Protocol There was considerable discussion of this issue in the IPP WG and there was general consensus that this was a area that could use some work. 
Several individuals at both meetings indicated a desire to contribute. 
It was the suggestion of the APP Area Director Keith Moore that this be set up this issue On December 16 &amp; 17 I presented the results of the IETF meetings to a group of PWG/IPP members in San Diego. 
The consensus at that meeting was that this concept has merit and should proceed. 
Several individuals at that meeting offered to participate in the work and the suggestion was put forward that I be proposed as the Chair of this new WG/BOF should it be chartered. 
Before I formally submit a request for a new WG to the AD's I'd like to bash out a Charter. 
The proposed charter below was discussed at the PWG/IPP meetings in San Diego. 
Any comments, suggestions, flames etc would be appreciated.

At a sufficient also be considered a remote printing or document transfer technology. 
The purpose of the work group will be to investigate and document those elements of IPP that qualify as a facsimile service. 
A goal of the WG will be those principals to IPP transactions. 
standards in a Store and Forward mode. 
Considerable evidence exists that there is a need for protocols that more closely approximate the real-time and point specified in RFC 2301. 
IPP has no such restrictions on the quality of document to be printed or displayed. 
The WG will not propose any revisions to the current Internet Print Protocol specifications but may use normal IPP Attribute Extensions and behavioral using elements of RFC2301 as needed. 
standards [RFC2305] and its successors. 
The group will take note of other areas within the IETF that may have direct Relevant areas include: - Security, Authentication and Encryption (SSL3 -TLS) - Sender Identification (vCard) The working group will take note of quality of service issues. 
The working group will coordinate its activities with the Internet Print other facsimile-related standards bodies and related work groups, notably the ITU-T Study Group 8.

"... and extend IPP where necessary to more closely perform the functions of facsimile." 
[see below] Clarify by changing to: I could see the IFX group proposing extensions or revisions to IPP, contain timestamps. 
I wouldn't want such extensions to be out of scope. 
Conneg? 
On the Internet, "Quality of Service" has distinct meaning -- be careful here. 
QoS usually means bounded delay of packet delivery -- much different from what you mean (which is likely bounded delay of the physical output). 
Perhaps something like: "The WG will attempt to provide mechanisms to allow interoperable implementations to be created which closely emulate -Dan Wing Excellent Point... at the regular IPP/PWG meeting in San Diego myself and Randy Turner of Sharp noted the need for IPP to make contact with the CONNEG WG and exchange ideas and concepts since IPP is pretty deep into defining capabilities for IPP Printer Objects. 
The CONNEG framework is IMHO perfect for printers...at the very least the framework IPP is considering should not conflict with CONNEG, though 3WC has several proposals on the table for similar concepts specifically in the mobile device area using XML [suprise?]. 
I'm very hopeful that the fine work of CONNEG can extend out into other application areas.

[Speaking as editor of some of the 'conneg' work...] I have already made contact with Franklin Reynolds who is author/editor of some W3C work in that field, and hope to maintain a constructive liaison. 
Me too!
