<s> On my old computer, a Pentium, running windows and a S3 video card, Amaya worked fine.  </s>
<s> On my new computer, a P4 with windows ME and a NVIDIA GEforce2 card, Amaya also works except that what should be a white background appears as  </s>
<s> yellow.  </s>
<s> light colours seem to have a yellowish tint, but dark ones look ok.  </s>
<s> I am a bit unwilling to fiddle too much with the card settings as all  </s>

<s> Could you give us more information : Is it Amaya Opengl version ?  </s>
<s> Last version or a CVS version ?  </s>
<s> What's the version of you video driver ?  </s>
<s> (display property - advanced configuration) If you're using the GL version, try getting the latest driver at www.nvidia.com  </s>

<s> I tried the GL version of Amaya and it fixed the colour problem.  </s>
<s> However the version I downloaded seems to be V6.0, in spite of the filename being "Amaya-WinGL-6.1.exe", and is quite seriously faulty in other ways.  </s>
<s> (Arrow keys and delete don't work, and when selecting text the cursor often gets lost and can't be recovered).  </s>
<s> Please excuse us for the trouble you get and the late answer : We had problems with 6.1 GL version but it is now fixed on our servers.  </s>
<s> The real 6.1 version is now on  </s>
<s> Until now I had not known there was a GL version.  </s>
<s> Is there a document somewhere that explains the difference between it and the 95 version ?  </s>
<s> There is documents explaining (a bit) the GL version at : Regards, -Paul  </s>
