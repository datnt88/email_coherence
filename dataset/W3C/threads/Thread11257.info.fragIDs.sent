1. Are characters [#x3021-#x3029] ideographic characters? 
These characters are listed in the definition of Ideographic [75]. 
However, in the Unicode standard (Version 2.0), these characters are Hangzhyou-style numerals. 
Are these characters digits or ideographic characters? 
2. Hankaku katakana extenders should be removed. 
From the definition of Extender [80], remove three characters as below: 0xFF70# HALFWIDTH KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK 0xFF9E# HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK 0xFF9F# HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK Also remove 65392, 65438, and 65439 from the list of NAMECHAR. 
These characters are hankaku katakana characters, which should be allowed for backward compatibility only. 
3. Add ditto mark (#x3003) as an extender. 
Also add 12291 to the list of NAMECHAR. 
This character is a pseudo-ideographic character, and 
it always follows an ideographic character. 
So, this character should be allowed as an extender. 
4. Add ideographic closing mark (#x3006) as an ideographic character. 
Also add 12295 to the list of NAMESTRT. 
This character is also a pseudo-ideographic character, and is sometimes used as the first character of the word "deadline" in Japanese. 
So, this character should be allowed as an ideographic character.

Both, I think. 
I disagree. 
We should either make them digits, or just take them out of namechar altogether. 
Comments? 
Agree. (see previous note) 
Seems reasonable to me. 
- Tim 
Probably, they are digits.
