<s> Microsoft/Seattle and University of Califnornia/Irvine has tentatively volunteered to host the meeting.  </s>
<s> Because of the lead time required under W3C rules to announce face-to-face meetings, we plan to decide on the date and location within a few days.  </s>

<s> Tentative initial dates for calls would be Jul 22, Aug 5, Aug 19.  </s>
