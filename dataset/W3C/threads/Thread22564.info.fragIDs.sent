<s> Dear W3 DOM members, I write to you as the author of the DOM Java binding package.  </s>
<s> I plan to make  </s>
<s> a Debian package of DOM Java binding and I would like your authorization and  </s>
<s> some details.  </s>
<s> What is Debian?  </s>
<s> Debian is a specific *distribution* of the Linux operating system.  </s>
<s> It is a set of programs, based on the same policy, regarding placement of files, etc, which can be installed without compiling anything.  </s>
<s> My personal opinion is that Debian is the best Linux distribution available and certainly the easiest to manage, thanks to its packaging system.  </s>
<s> You can have more information at http://www.debian.org/ .  </s>
<s> What is a Debian package?  </s>
<s> A package is a binary archive of a program (or a closely related group of programs) which owners of a Debian system can install or remove easily, by one command.  </s>
<s> Files in the package are arranged according to the Debian policy, so the user is certain to find the documentation in /usr/doc/lib-dom-java, the configuration files in /etc and so on.  </s>
<s> Packages are made by volunteers like me which take an existing program, patch it if necessary and describes the rules that make it "Debian-compliant".  </s>
<s> What do I need?  </s>
<s> I would like your authorization, and please, if you say yes, keep me informed of future versions so I can update the package.  </s>
<s> I would like to know, in the case of agreement, in which section to put the package.  </s>
<s> We (Debian) have a "main" section where all the software which meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines  </s>
<s> go.  </s>
<s> A "non-free" section is available for the programs which, in one way or the other, fail to meet these requirements but can still be distributed, at least via the Internet.  </s>
<s> I am not sure we can put the Java bindings in "main".  </s>
<s> The licence http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/copyright-notice.html says "No right to create modifications or derivatives is granted pursuant to this license."  </s>
<s> which seems to exclude freedom to modify.  </s>
<s> I understand  </s>
<s> that DOM is intended to be normative and therefore not modified at will, and that the Java bindings are not a real program but more a formal specification but it still bothers me.  </s>
<s> For instance, the Debian packaging itself is a modification, no?  </s>
<s> Any advice?  </s>
<s> Yours, Stephane Bortzmeyer bortzmeyer@debian.org  </s>
<s> On Friday 5 November 1999, at 15 h 0, the keyboard of Stephane Bortzmeyer  </s>
<s> OK, Mark Wielaard mark@klomp.org remarked that W3C software is covered by a different licence, http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software.html (thanks for your FAQ about licensing, BTW), and therefore is free.  </s>
<s> So, unless I misundesrtood the above licence, the Java bindings to DOM will be in our "main" section.  </s>
<s> That's right.  </s>
<s> Our W3C softwares are covered by : and our documents are covered by :  </s>
<s> Sorry, but the Java binding are part of the DOM Level 1 specification.  </s>
<s> They are covered by our document copyright.  </s>
<s> You can't modify them in any way.  </s>
<s> Feel free to package them as long as you don't modify them.  </s>

<s> Take Me Out Of The List  </s>
<s> make  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> The problem here may be multiple definitions of the word "package", and multiple packages in a single application... Let's try a concrete example: IBM's XML4J parser, which currently includes two implementations of the DOM.  </s>
<s> The DOM API Interfaces themselves (Node.java and so on) are included un-altered as the org.w3c.dom package.  </s>
<s> The implementations live in their own packages (eg com.ibm.xml.dom).  </s>
<s> They reference the DOM APIs, and are operated primarily in terms of the DOM APIs, but their code is kept distinct from the W3C's code.  </s>
<s> They may provide additional functions, or implement additional interfaces, as well.  </s>
<s> All these packages wind up in a single jar-file when IBM distributes the compiler.  </s>
<s> But by keeping the packages distinct, they maintain a clear line between which features are defined by the DOM and which are custom additions.  </s>
<s> Doing so ensures that if this code is linked with other DOM-based code, compiled seperately with another copy of org.w3c.dom, everything will connect up properly.  </s>
<s> Even without the copyright issue, that is a Darned Good Reason to do it this way.  </s>
