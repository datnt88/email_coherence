I found descrepency in Hopmann specification about connection oriented HTTP extension draft. 
I also confirmed the conflict with Mr Hopmann. 
Iam attaching part of the mail message with this note for other server developers.Please correct the information in your downloaded version of the draft 
We are not proceeding with the specification that Alex wrote. 
Persistent connections were already implemented by several vendors using the notes I produced early this year, and which I reposted to the mailing list last month. 
Please see 
for more information.

I couldn't find your notes, and I have a question. 
Did your proposal include multipart/mixed responses for keep-alive cgi scripts? 
That seems to be what everyone is implementing. 
I'm not happy with using the "multipart/mixed" 
name. 
I would prefer "multipart/x-http-response" or something like it so that we don't have name space collision with email messages.

No, and I'm not aware of *any* implementation that does this. 
Is somebody holding out on me? 
Right now, CGI scripts just ignore keep-alive and close the connection. 
For the "official" HTTP/1.1, they can use the chunked transfer encoding instead of a multipart, if desired. 
Netscape navigator and the netscape server both use "multipart/mixed" as per Alex's proposal. 
I'm not aware of any server implementer's even wanting to support chunked transfer encoding. 
I for one will strongly fight against adding yet another encoding form. 
That isn't a namespace collision -- multiparts are just multiparts: a mechanism for sending multiple bodies in a single message. 
The UA should treat them identically no matter where they come from. 
There is a namespace collision. 
the user representation of a multipart/mixed message is well specified and does not conform to the usage in Alex's proposal. 
"Multipart" encoding is the right thing for HTTP but it should use a different sub name.

FWIW, my (non-product) server supports chunking.

Is there an HTTP (firewall) proxy server implementation that supports this? 
rom what I understand in the Keep Alive notes ( URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0063.html ) this form of persistent connection can be used for a single but unbounded request (as opposed to multiple requests) ( URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0237.html ).
