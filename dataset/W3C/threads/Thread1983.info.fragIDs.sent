<s> I found descrepency in Hopmann specification about connection oriented HTTP extension draft.  </s>
<s> I also confirmed the conflict with Mr Hopmann.  </s>
<s> Iam attaching part of the mail message with this note for other server developers.Please correct the information in your downloaded version of the draft  </s>
<s> We are not proceeding with the specification that Alex wrote.  </s>
<s> Persistent connections were already implemented by several vendors using the notes I produced early this year, and which I reposted to the mailing list last month.  </s>

<s> I couldn't find your notes, and I have a question.  </s>
<s> Did your proposal include multipart/mixed responses for keep-alive cgi scripts?  </s>
<s> That seems to be what everyone is implementing.  </s>
<s> I'm not happy with using the "multipart/mixed"  </s>
<s> name.  </s>
<s> I would prefer "multipart/x-http-response" or something like it so that we don't have name space collision with email messages.  </s>

<s> Netscape Communications Corp.  </s>
<s> No, and I'm not aware of *any* implementation that does this.  </s>
<s> Is somebody holding out on me?  </s>
<s> Right now, CGI scripts just ignore keep-alive and close the connection.  </s>
<s> For the "official" HTTP/1.1, they can use the chunked transfer encoding instead of a multipart, if desired.  </s>
<s> Netscape navigator and the netscape server both use "multipart/mixed" as per Alex's proposal.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware of any server implementer's even wanting to support chunked transfer encoding.  </s>
<s> I for one will strongly fight against adding yet another encoding form.  </s>
<s> That isn't a namespace collision -- multiparts are just multiparts: a mechanism for sending multiple bodies in a single message.  </s>
<s> The UA should treat them identically no matter where they come from.  </s>
<s> There is a namespace collision.  </s>
<s> the user representation of a multipart/mixed message is well specified and does not conform to the usage in Alex's proposal.  </s>
<s> "Multipart" encoding is the right thing for HTTP but it should use a different sub name.  </s>

<s> FWIW, my (non-product) server supports chunking.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Is there an HTTP (firewall) proxy server implementation that supports this?  </s>
<s> rom what I understand in the Keep Alive notes ( URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0063.html ) this form of persistent connection can be used for a single but unbounded request (as opposed to multiple requests) ( URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0237.html ).  </s>
