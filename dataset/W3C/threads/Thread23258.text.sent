Is there a feature string for testing the various DOM3 Load and Save interfaces? 
There's AS_DOC and AS-EDIT for abstract scheams but I don't see one for Load and Save.

Subject: feature string for Load-Save Fixed. 
"LS-Load" for the DOMBuilder and "LS-Save" for the DOMWriter. 
Synchronous mode is always required. 
Asynchronous mode is required if you support "LS-Load-Async". 
Not sure what to do with the DocumentLS interface yet. 
more to come on that in the future. 
Philippe Is there a feature string for testing the various DOM3 DocumentAS interface? 
The spec says " One feature string for the AS-editing interfaces listed in this section is "AS-EDIT" and another feature string for document-editing interfaces is "AS-DOC"." 
However, neither of these obviously applies to the DocumentAS interface which falls under the heading "Validation and Other Interfaces."

| Since the functionality under "Validation and Other Interfaces" is common to both AS-editing and document-editing, a retrieval of either "AS-EDIT" or "AS-DOC" could be interpreted as having support of these features. 
However, if document-editing is to be completely independent of AS-editing, then perhaps another feature string should be made for functionality under this section. 
We will discuss in our AS ET telcon.
