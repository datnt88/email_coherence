<s> Is it valid to use a fragment identifier with a URN?  </s>
<s> The definition of a fragment identifier in RFC2396 suggests that they are only relevant to URLs: When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed.  </s>
<s> This specifically defines a fragment identifier to be information related to a retrieval action, which implies that it makes no sense to use a fragment identifier with a URI scheme intended to denote names with no implied retrieval mechanism.  </s>
<s> However, I have certainly seen them used with URNs.  </s>
<s> Has this issue been clarified in any documents subsequent to RFC2396?  </s>

<s> Note, however, that your suggested change would restrict the applicability of a URI-reference beyond what the specification currently requires, to the point where it conflicts with the Web.  </s>
<s> You are suggesting that an application-specific requirement be placed on an existing protocol element in order to satisfy some restriction that somebody wants to use within RDF.  </s>
<s> I don't see any reason why we should make that change.  </s>
<s> Actually, I'm not proposing making a change, just finding out how compatible the IETF notion of a URI is with the use of a URI scheme to represent abstract names with no retrieval semantics.  </s>
<s> The answer  </s>
<s> seems to be that it's not compatible.  </s>
<s> For the record though, I don't see how such a change would "conflict with the Web".  </s>
