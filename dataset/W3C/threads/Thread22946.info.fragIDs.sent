<s> I understand that some events do not bubble, but is it correct to say that ALL events support capture?  </s>
<s> This seems to be implied by the DOM Level 2 Events CR based on the fact that you can ask an Event whether it bubbles but you cannot ask an Event whether it can be captured.  </s>
<s> If Event.bubbles is false, only the Capture, At-Target, and Default phases of event distribution are performed.  </s>
<s> If true, bubbling distribution is performed as well, between At-Target and Default.  </s>
<s> Event _listeners_ are explicitly registered either as capturing (invoked only during the Capture phase) or non-capturing (At-Target and Bubbling phases).  </s>
<s> A single listener may be registered both ways, if desired.  </s>
<s> At this time there is no independent ability to suppress the Capture or At-Target phases.  </s>
<s> Default can be suppressed by invoking Event.preventDefault, but I believe that has to be done from a handler since it gets reset each time the event is dispatched.  </s>
<s> If you've got a use case for making this more flexible, please submit it for consideration in future revisions of DOM Events.  </s>

<s> I'd actually like to have bubbling and capturing specified as orthogonal dispatch mechanism such that an event can: + capture and bubble + capture and not bubble + not capture and bubble + not capture and not bubble And also for event listeners to register for these orthogonally.  </s>
<s> The last would be ideal for optimising controlled environments.  </s>
<s> As I understand, currently capture implies not bubbles and bubbles implies not capture.  </s>
<s> If that is the case, I'm mildy disappointed at that design decision.  </s>

<s> Actually, I am not sure if I should take that back.  </s>
<s> I had first thought that my the event listeners I've written are only interested in the At-Target phase.  </s>
<s> I've come to realise that this isn't quite the case.  </s>
<s> My event listeners are registered on nodes so that when a new node is inserted onto that node, the event listener would add new eventlisteners to the new child.  </s>
<s> This allows me to recursively define rules that apply to a whole document as the document is built.  </s>
<s> I perform the following check to ensure that my event listener only acts on a direct child: if (event.currentTarget.parentNode  </s>
<s> != event.target)  </s>
<s> My argument before was that some use cases will benefit greatly in performance by having a class of event registration that only responds to the At-Target phase and I had believed my application fell under that category.  </s>
<s> Now I know I may be slightly mistaken.  </s>
<s> My application is incapable of making use of such a facility given the current set of Mutation Events.  </s>
<s> It may still benefit from this facility if there existed some Mutation Event perhaps called "DOMChildInserted", which has the parent as the target and the child as the relatedNode.  </s>
<s> It sounds simple enough to add additional Mutation Events, but I am also concerned that a larger set of Mutation Events will incur a larger intrinsic overhead in DOM operations.  </s>
<s> My views on this issue are for the moment inconclusive.  </s>
<s> Thanks -John  </s>
