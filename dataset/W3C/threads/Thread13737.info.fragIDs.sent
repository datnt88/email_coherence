Cool stuff. 
The idea for a linear version of EARL in XML has been floating around for a long time, but this is the most comprehensive schema so far. 
In fact, the use of para in some of the documentationproperties is an extension: I hadn't thought about allowing XML structures in there (although that's an RDF grey area). 
The same kind of issues raised about that an abbreviated syntax is not useful for the majority of people that automatically produce EARL; that validation is the main advantage, as long as a standard transformation is used; that consensus must be reached upon the level of features to be included in the linear format.

The same kind of issues raised about that an abbreviated syntax is not useful for the majority of people that automatically produce EARL; CMN: It isn't that it isn't useful, just that the value of it isn't that high. 
Storing a lot of information makes a difference, and large scale users will be storing info. 
Again, it isn't critical, but it isn't a bad thing for a bunch of use cases. 
SBP that validation is the main advantage, as long as a standard transformation is used; CMN Yes. 
This seems like a neat feature to have in some cases - most particularly in saying "I don't trust an assertion that doesn't have all the right pieces". 
SBP that consensus must be reached upon the level of features to be included in the linear format. 
CMN True for a "canonical form", and I think one of those is useful. 
But there are also cases where people are going to want a particular profile because it meets their need, and they might publish it and provide an explanation of how to make it into the RDF form. 
Alternatively, if we keep RDF as the "canonical representation" then they just have to make their XML be RDF, and we can describe how that can be done. 
(this is more a benefit for RDF in terms of explaining ways to do RDF than for EARL itself I guess, but that's OK too... if it doesn't cost us too much to do) cheers Chaals
