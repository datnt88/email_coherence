<s> This is a simple project that is designed for 3 year olds and not accessible to wai standards.  </s>
<s> Frankly I feel it would be a waste of time to produce a text based example, though blind users require similar encouragement.  </s>
<s> However what efforts are being made to provide a graphical means of browsing the web?  </s>
<s> interactive video is not what I am describing.  </s>

<s> Are you asking - what to do to help a non-reader find sites that would interest him or her?  </s>
<s> - Or what to do to help him or her navigate the site once he or she gets there?  </s>
<s> And thanks for the pointer to http://www.argosphere.net/simons/shapes/frame.htm  </s>
<s> It's a delightful page with two sets of shapes.  </s>
<s> When you drag a shape from one set to the same shape and color on the other set, you get an entertaining result , e.g. a little face appears on the shape.  </s>
<s> I can't think of how text would be useful to the person playing the game.  </s>
<s> But it would be useful for an observer.  </s>
<s> For example, a textual description would be useful for a parent who wants to find out about the game to show to his or her child.  </s>
<s> It would also be useful to provide a means for a parent to know what's happening when the child successfully drags the shape.  </s>
<s> For example a sound... that the child would also enjoy.  </s>
<s> Of course, parent and child is just an example.  </s>
<s> The same philosophy applies I think to any people who are friends, lovers, companions etc. who want to share an experience.  </s>

<s> Not in Opera 4.02 (drag/drop doesn't work) or Netscape 6.3 (only the first shape loads and nothing further happens).  </s>
<s> In MSIE 5.5 it works as advertised although the window size is frozen (unlike in Opera).  </s>
<s> This is not atypical of problems facing people creating real stuff.  </s>
<s> It led to the old "get a real browser" annoyances and now makes using CSS a mini-nightmare.  </s>
<s> Oh, well!  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Leonard, I don't appreciate your distinction.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could elaborate?  </s>

<s> - Or what to do to help him or her navigate the site once he or she gets there?  </s>
<s> My point remains that whilst there is not enough suitable graphical material on the web, the far more serious problem is the lack of an animated graphical browsing interface(including a search facility), that links these materials.  </s>
<s> The nearest I have as a proposal, is hopefully what svg promises, and something like java/flash but with links to external sites, but without the 'lurching' or stop-go currently encountered.  </s>
