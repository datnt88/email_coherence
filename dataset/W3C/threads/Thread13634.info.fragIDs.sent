This is a simple project that is designed for 3 year olds and not accessible to wai standards. 
Frankly I feel it would be a waste of time to produce a text based example, though blind users require similar encouragement. 
However what efforts are being made to provide a graphical means of browsing the web? 
interactive video is not what I am describing.

Re graphical means to browse the web. 
Are you asking - what to do to help a non-reader find sites that would interest him or her? 
- Or what to do to help him or her navigate the site once he or she gets there? 
And thanks for the pointer to http://www.argosphere.net/simons/shapes/frame.htm 
It's a delightful page with two sets of shapes. 
When you drag a shape from one set to the same shape and color on the other set, you get an entertaining result , e.g. a little face appears on the shape. 
I can't think of how text would be useful to the person playing the game. 
But it would be useful for an observer. 
For example, a textual description would be useful for a parent who wants to find out about the game to show to his or her child. 
It would also be useful to provide a means for a parent to know what's happening when the child successfully drags the shape. 
For example a sound... that the child would also enjoy. 
Of course, parent and child is just an example. 
The same philosophy applies I think to any people who are friends, lovers, companions etc. who want to share an experience.

Not in Opera 4.02 (drag/drop doesn't work) or Netscape 6.3 (only the first shape loads and nothing further happens). 
In MSIE 5.5 it works as advertised although the window size is frozen (unlike in Opera). 
This is not atypical of problems facing people creating real stuff. 
It led to the old "get a real browser" annoyances and now makes using CSS a mini-nightmare. 
Oh, well! 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Leonard, I don't appreciate your distinction. 
Perhaps you could elaborate?

My point remains that whilst there is not enough suitable graphical material on the web, the far more serious problem is the lack of an animated graphical browsing interface(including a search facility), that links these materials. 
The nearest I have as a proposal, is hopefully what svg promises, and something like java/flash but with links to external sites, but without the 'lurching' or stop-go currently encountered.
