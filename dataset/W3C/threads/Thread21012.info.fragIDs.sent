<s> Thus, annotations should use WWW collaboration tools, and one important application of WWW collaboration tolls is annotations!  </s>

<s> Hello Jacob,  </s>
<s> In this case, annotation refers to a more specific type of collaboration.  </s>
<s> The annotation working group has been discussing annotations as documents or objects which reference or annotate other documents or objects (including other annotations).  </s>
<s> You can learn more about annotations in this context through the annotation working group web page at  </s>
<s> The www-annotation mailing list is intended for the discussion of annotations as originally put forth by the annotation working group, while the www-collaboration mailing list is intended as a more general discussion to cover all other kinds of collaboration technology and tools.  </s>

<s> I've been thinking that annotation is but a special case of metadata.  </s>

<s> If we were to wave a  </s>
<s> magic wand to whisk away the problems of addressing annotations to a version and/or partial-object (byte ranges, etc), an annotation server could use the same interface to list annotations as it would for more general forms of metadata on objects it served.  </s>

<s> Well during last year's W3C meeting on the subject, annotation was a form of collaboration.  </s>
<s> Annotation is not necesarily shared.  </s>
<s> Private annotations have some value external to the more general issues of collaboration.  </s>
<s> I think in the original discussion, annotations were viewed as commentary on content not owned or controlled by the annotator.  </s>
<s> The technical issues I see are the correlation between arbitrary content in all its various complex forms.  </s>
<s> Once the annotation is created in the context of a collaboration support system, I would expect a bit more structure and control which would leave annotations as just one form of collaborative comment which should have the full power of the Collab system to support general discussion.  </s>
<s> Of course, since we are at the instant talking about a web deployed collaboration support system, it could also be the target of annotations of arbitrary material.  </s>
<s> I believe this one way connection to arbitrary material is what distinguishes annotations from general discussion.  </s>
<s> The arbitrary connection is probably not the most effective way to comment within a collaborative support system.  </s>
<s> Two examples of private annotation in current products may be found in the Quarterdeck WWW browser and in ZooWorks.  </s>
<s> Both allow users to make private notes to themselves.  </s>
<s> Useful and necessary in a group support context and also not sufficient for the full power of group collaboration.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> I still do not see the difference.  </s>
<s> Why cannot a discussion be an annotation, with reference to another document or to some specific word, sentence, paragraph or section of another document?  </s>
<s> Why cannot an annotation be extended into a discussion between several people, if more than one person has something to contribute to the annotation?  </s>

<s> There are personal annotations and group annotations.  </s>
<s> In general there are several types of annotations.  </s>
<s> During the life cycle of an information resource, the type of an annotation will likely change.  </s>
<s> You can adopt the content model (if you feel comfortable with it) where every piece of displayable, consumable media is a form of annotation.  </s>
<s> Then you've got atomic anotations (eg HTML pages) and composite annotation sets.  </s>
<s> Either way, the topic of annotation and collaboration are bound together, yet are independant of each other in several important ways.  </s>
<s> There is no more inherant a binding between annotations and collaboration then there is between collaboration and images.  </s>
<s> Some times the collaborative work group may want to discuss either.  </s>
<s> There may be a collaborative annotation type as the interface between the models.  </s>

<s> Jacob, Just a caution....instead of getting in to the negative cycle of definitions why don't you propose what you want to work on.  </s>
<s> The working groups were setup not as debating circles, but to see if we could do some "work" together.  </s>
<s> So, want to propose a definition for annotation (or whatever it is you want to work on) that you like and talk about reference implementations, and how to get there.  </s>
