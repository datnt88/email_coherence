<s> Largely because the DOM doesn't have any concept of "collection" per se.  </s>
<s> There are NodeLists and NamedNodeMaps -- but these should probably be thought of as views of the data, not as actual collection objects which contain those nodes.  </s>
<s> The underlying implementation may not be collection-based; a node's children, for example, may be retained that way, may be linked-lists, may be accessed as a database query, or anything else that seemed appropriate to that DOM's developers.  </s>
<s> Also, a node may be in many "collections" at once -- for example, you may have several "deep" NodeLists (from getElementsByTag) and a "shallow" NodeList (from getChildren), all of which overlap with each other.  </s>
<s> If a Node knows its offset at all (see above) it will probably know only its offset in the getChildren list.  </s>
<s> To find its index in other lists or maps, the DOM would have to search through the view.  </s>
<s> It might be possible to optimize this .getIndexOf(Node)  </s>
<s> operation in some implementations of NodeList and NamedNodeMap.  </s>
<s> For that reason, it might be worth considering adding this call at some point.  </s>
<s> I'll add it to the wishlist.  </s>
<s> If any of the DOM WG/IG members want to be listed as advocates, drop me a note.  </s>
<s> However -- speaking only for myself -- I'm somewhat dubious that this would be used often enough to be much more than a convenince feature.  </s>
<s> Especially given that I expect Level 2's Traversal chapter to largely replace NodeLists.  </s>
