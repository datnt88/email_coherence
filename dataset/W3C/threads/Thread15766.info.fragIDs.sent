<s> There is no such thing as universal sign language.  </s>
<s> Each community's sign language is a naturally formed language with it's own phonology, morphology, and syntax.  </s>
<s> If a Deaf American and a Deaf German meet on the street, they *won't* understand each other.  </s>
<s> Thank you Jess, I think I mentioned that it was the closest, LOL - how do you sign "Chicken Fried Steak" in German?  </s>
<s> I am more familiar with Word Order Signed English, ALS is a language in it's own - I have trouble understanding it, people from California use "SEES" and it thows me for a loop.  </s>
<s> I thought basic signs such as "stop", "go", "me", "eat", numbers etc were the same signs in all languages.  </s>
<s> But, Jess, isn't *Word-Order-Signed-English* more transferable?  </s>
<s> Please correct me if I am wrong, one can never know too much about such things.  </s>
<s> It would be an interesting experiment to use graphic images of Signs for naviagtion etc on a website except some would have to be animated gifs.  </s>
<s> ("Home" is a 2 motion sign) or require more than one image to represent each image.  </s>
<s> (?) I have seen animated gifs finger-spelling words on websites, a bit too much bytes.  </s>
<s> But surely using these would alienate those who do not read Sign or have trouble processing Signing.  </s>
<s> Back to graphic symbols!! Check out Bliss Symbolics (thanks Bruce) they are very easy to learn and use: KPR, (= Kindest personal regards) LK  </s>
<s> I forgot - check out University Lyon's Sign Server: KPR, LK  </s>
<s> Yes, in agreement with Alex and Jess and Chris - each of you explained the difference between word order, ASL (and BSL), and the pros and cons of using them as "symbols" in HTML documents much more eloquectly than I could have!  </s>
<s> Thank you for your input.  </s>
<s> I agree it is getting off topic for this list - as for using Sign graphic symbols as tools on the internet it would be akin to reinventing the wheel - but is still intriging.  </s>
<s> I would like to continue discussing these ideas off list or if any of you can refer me to further info on or off line.  </s>
<s> commication difficulties (dyslexia and TMD), and to have a lively conversation with my son (who has Downs and is hearing Impaired) using 'Total Communication" is such a thrill!  </s>
<s> I find all methods of communication facinating, particularly in my situation.  </s>
<s> And am amazed as to how much "intutition" is involved when face to face with a person - The one thing, alas, that will ever be lacking on the internet.  </s>
<s> (Not disregarding M.O.N.A. the Signing Avatar - but she's pretty scary looking!) It is also interesting (and exasperating) how easily ideas can be misinterpeted regardless if spoken or written - two can write the same idea yet sound opposing simply by their choice of structure and semantics.... Thansk for the insight and input.  </s>
<s> Back to work writing descriptions for D- Links!  </s>

<s> The accessibility issues for Web standards and tools: What is a "language?"  </s>
<s> What are the possible means of communication?  </s>
<s> Current standards - such as the HTML LANG attribute - presume textual/legible or verbal/audible communication.  </s>
<s> Sign languages are communicated through visual, spatial and haptic (touch) means.  </s>
<s> As the speed of communications and image/graphics processing increase and prices decrease, visual communication and other mediums become more feasible.  </s>
<s> Literatures of sign languages - recorded speech - can be stored and communicated over the Web.  </s>
<s> Eventually, and soon, real-time sign language communication will become possible.  </s>
<s> Improvements in adaptive technologies also expand the options and responsibilities for authors and user agents (browsers).  </s>
<s> For example, I can think of no technological reason why someone who is both deaf and blind should not be able to use a haptic device, communicating by touch and force-feedback, to browse the Web.  </s>
<s> However, for this to work: - Authors must be able to identify the source language, including sign languages - User agents must recognize and support users' language preferences, including sign languages - User agents must support transcription of the message through enabling technologies.  </s>
<s> Standards must not preclude these possibilities.  </s>
<s> Ideally, they should support and encourage their development.  </s>
<s> P.S.: Agreed, "Mona" is scary-looking!  </s>
