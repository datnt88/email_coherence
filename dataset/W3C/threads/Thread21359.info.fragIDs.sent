Hi, 
Are any Annotation Types other than comment currently implemented? 
It seems to me everything is a Comment. 
I'd quite like to have seeAlso, but that doesn't really have an appropriate body does it?

Really? 
When I was starting on Annozilla, it looked to me as though everything were an Annotation, but some were also other types, eg Comments.

Comments. 
All the annotations have rdf:type of a:Annotation however they also have a property a:annotationType of 
Since looking in more detail, I've also found an although the actual annotations don't appear to be any different from the normal comments, and certainly aren't Examples and a single one of Question - they seem to share a addr:name/addr:firstName being identical aswell, so it could be from a different UA? 
On that might it be nice if we could trace which client made an attribution - at the moment I only send identifying in the http header, it might be nice if we included it withing the attribution itself.

Annozilla can do different annotation types. 
I agree this would be useful, if only for identifying compatibility problems.

This seems to be different to the description on the Annotea protocols page Figure 1, etc. i.e. two r:type's but no a:annotationType.
