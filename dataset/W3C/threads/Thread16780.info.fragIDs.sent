Here is my current "favorite" for overly chatty ALT tags making content nearly inaccessible: 
But please wear a bullet-proof vest to deflect the large, spherical red objects!

Actually, Patrick, they're blue bullets!

Read the alt tags... and you'll get the joke.

I must be missing something. 
Unless claiming the bullets are red when they are actually blue is a joke. 
What this page seems to be to me is a perfect example of how NOT to use the alt attribute.

I found the fact that the color was wrong in the ALT to be hilarious. 
Not to mention what you sd - this is NOT the way to do an ALT attribute. 
And you have to love that its our NATIONAL Zoo's website! 
Cheers!

I think the designer might have been colour blind grin ... but did any of 
you go to the "animal feeding and interpretation" section? 
I won't spoil the surprise, but let you visit the page frown !

Hmmm, with Jaws I didn't notice anything too unusual. 
There must be strange visual things going on? 
For the record, as a person with blindness (non-darkness-impaired reader, etc.) &amp; screen reader user, I did not know that the bullets were actually blue until others pointed it out. 
I was warning people about the red ones because there are so many of them. 
I think it's a highpoint of Web comedy that they are in fact blue. 
For the record, the Jaws "Link List" command (or similar command in other screen readers) let's one navigate easily through the links without the red/blue bullets (although it does not help with the "This is a large navigation button that goes to ..." problem (I paraphrase")). 
In defense of the National Zoo, I found their questionnaire / feedback form to be very accessible. 
So we can send our requests for improved ALT tagging fairly easily (though it is tempting to preserve the site as part of a Menagerie of Poor Design Practice).

Hi Patrick, The section I referred to (animal feeding and interpretation: amount of information about feeding times and interpretive activities - the catch is that this information is all provided as GIFs (img1.gif &amp; img3.gif) with no alt text or other means of getting to the information except visually!

Ouch! That is a bad design for sure. 
It makes me want to apply for a Webmaster job to fix the problem :). [grin] "Now I have you where I want you... where is my jar of Bull ants?" --unknown /\___/\ Phillip Pi (Ant) from apu.edu.
