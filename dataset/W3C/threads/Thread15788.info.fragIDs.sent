<s> I took a look at your web site and the accessibility portion has all you really need in the way of guidelines and being on this list will yeild for you several individuals with special browsing and other interface issues.  </s>
<s> In addition, I cannot resist pointing you to another person with your same name at a company which has done a lot of work in the field of access on and off the web.  </s>
<s> Henter-joyce Inc. Has produced most likely the most versatile general text to braille and speech pc interface to daye.  </s>
<s> Their sales manager shares your name if I remember correctly.  </s>
<s> Our goal which you should keep in mind though is to produce a method of page authoring and interfacing that is independant of what you use for that purpose.  </s>
<s> If I use netscape or ie or xyz browser, I should be able to access all components of a site with no help from my aid except for that which is normally rendered that being to make it possible for me to interface with the document or applete in my own special way.  </s>
<s> you can reach henter joyce however at: or by contacting: sales@hj.com  </s>
<s> I believe they have a timed evaluation package such that it will expire on a given date.  </s>
<s> Thanks for asking.  </s>
