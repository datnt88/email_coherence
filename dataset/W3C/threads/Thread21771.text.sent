I've copied the following document fro 12\CR back into 06\LC and checked them in: entitieswd.dtd 
prevwgmb.txt 
soap-encoding.xsd soap-envelope.xsd soap-rpc.xsd 
soap12-part0.html 
soap12-part1.xml 
soap12-part2.xml 
wgmb.txt xmlspec.xsl 
This is all the files whose version number was greater than 1.1 ( and therefore had been changed since being copied from 06\LC to 12\CR ). 
When I checked each file in I put the entire change log from 12\CR for that file into the change log comment for the 06\LC check-in. 
Yves, Can you do the necessary boilerplate/entity changes to turn these back into editor's copies, please? 
Once you have done that I will put a change log back into Part 1 and 2. Gudge Thanks to Yves, Parts 1 and 2 ed copies are now ready for post-CR editing. 
As before these are in 2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC Gudge Done for part1 and part2, thanks for keeping the URIs :) Yves Lafon - W3C "Baroula que barouleras, au ti?u toujou t'entourneras." 
Just as well since I've been editing these copies for the last few weeks, adding the CR issue resolutions etc ;-). 
Cheers, Marc.
