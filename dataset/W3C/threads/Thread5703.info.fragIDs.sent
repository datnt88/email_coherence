<s> Hi, There are some suggestions for http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# as follows.  </s>
<s> 1. xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"  </s>
<s> maybe change to: xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/tr/rdf#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/tr/rdf-schema#" xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/tr/owl#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"  </s>
<s> So, these namespace will be stable relatively.  </s>
<s> And add dc:date or owl:versionInfo into the ontology.  </s>
<s> 2. The "Resource" had been defined by RDF Model and Sytax, not RDF Schema, So "Resource" should be rdf:Resource.  </s>
<s> and the following statment should be appended in http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#.  </s>
<s> rdfs:Class rdf:ID="Resource" 3. The following statments should be appended in http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#.  </s>
<s> rdfs:Class rdf:ID="XMLLiteral" rdf:type rdf:Resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema#Datatype" rdfs:comment="The class of XML literal values." /  </s>
<s> rdfs:Class rdf:ID="List" rdfs:comment="The class of RDF Lists." / rdfs:Class rdf:ID="nil" rdfs:comment="The empty list."  </s>
<s> / Property ID="first" rdfs:comment="The first item in the subject RDF list."  </s>
<s> / Property ID="rest" rdfs:comment="The rest of the subject RDF list after the first item."  </s>
<s> / Perhaps, rdf:about, rdf:ID, rdf:RDF, rdf:Desciption should also be defined in http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#.  </s>
<s> Regards, Lotus Wu ps.  </s>

<s> Thank you for these suggestions.  </s>
<s> The WG did consider changing the namespace names as it updated the specifications but decided not to.  </s>
<s> I beleive that considerations of the undesirable effects on existing data and implemntations weighed more heavily than any advantage gained.  </s>
<s> Err, no - we really don't want to do that.  </s>
<s> it would be a bad thing if the meaning of an existing document changed when we updated the spec.  </s>
<s> And add dc:date or owl:versionInfo into the ontology.  </s>
<s> We are planning to update this document and will likely include owl:versionInfo.  </s>
<s> I think this is covered by our decision not to change the namespaces.  </s>
<s> Were we changing the namespaces, this would be a sensible change to make, but since we are not, then this is not an appropriate time to make such a change.  </s>
<s> Yes. We are planning to update this document and will include these new terms.  </s>
<s> WG discussion and a draft of the new version can be found at: Please respond to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org indicating whether this is an acceptable response.  </s>

<s> Dear Brian, Thank you for your response.  </s>
<s> This response is satisfactory.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the explanation.  </s>
