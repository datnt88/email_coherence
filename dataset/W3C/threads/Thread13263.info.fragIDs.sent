Based on Michael's suggestion, I modified technique 3.2 to read: Technique 3.2.A [priority 2] Check document for public text identifier Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: The document must contain a valid HTML or XHTML public text identifier if it is an HTML or XHTML document. 
If a text identifier is not the first line of the document, refuse to evaluate the document. 
A a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib/catalog" list of public text identifiers /a is available from the W3C. 
The document is an HTML document if there is an HTML element near the start of the document and there is an HTML end element as the last non-whitespace text in the document. 
Example Language: Missing language identifier for this document. 
Repair Technique: Prompt the user for a public text identifier. 
Test Files and Discussion Files: Link to test file for this technique.

Yup - but I didn't mean to refuse to evaluate the document if there isn't a text identifier in the first line of the doc - we'd skip a lot! 
I meant if we determine the doc is not HTML, or fail to determine that it is HTML, on the basis of either the text identifier or the presence of an HTML as the first and only outermost markup tag (excluding comments, processing instructions, etc.), then we might not want to try to evaluate it. 
Not to mention flag an error under this checkpoint.

I agree that we should still evaluate a document even if it doesn't have a DTD reference as the first line. 
After all, the requirement for a DTD is priority 2 (cf. 
WCAG checkpoint 3.2), and we don't want to refuse to evaluate a document for Priority 1 if it lacks a priority 2. Len

That catalog needs updating: nothing on XHTML yet. 
There are other valid sources for registering XML applications. 
Both BizTalk and OASIS are developing such catalogs for valid applications (of HTML, XML, and possibly SGML). 
Should we have a reference to those sources as well? 
That is a presumption, the html ... /html wrapper could be placed around most anything. 
The current browsers attempt to make sense of anything. 
What is inside needs to be validated to the purported html version. 
This checkpoint addresses the presence of a public text identifier that is valid. 
It is stronger than that sentence suggests.
