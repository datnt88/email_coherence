Hi, I'm attempting to modify Amaya so that it will read files written in a markup language of my own devising. 
It looks like (among other things) I need to write the equivalent of html2thot.c for my language. 
I'd like to use html2thot.c 
as a guide while I do it, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the size of the file. 
Could someone give me an overview of the structure of this file? 
What are the important functions? 
What precisely does this file do and how does it get called? 
In the comments of I've noticed references to a stack and to an automaton. 
What are these and how do they work? 
Any help would be appreciated. 
Thanks very much.

In html2thot.c the main procedure is called StartParser. 
That function creates the initial document, open the file and launches the parser (HTMLparse) which scans each input character. 
At the first level, it uses the automaton to detect entities, start and end tags. 
At the second level it uses the tables of HTML elements and HTML atributes to know what Thot element or attribute type must be generated. 
I guess you have to build your tables there. 
Many other functions are there for correcting HTML errors or for adding specific work (see EndOfStartTag, EndOfEndTag). 
Hope that helps Irene. 
How are MathML and GraphML dealt with in html2thot.c? Amaya understands elements from these languages in the middle of HTML files but I can't find any much mention of them in html2thot.c. 
I'm wondering if the best way to implement another language is to do it how MathML and GraphML are done. 
Again, any help will be much appreciated. 
Thanks.
