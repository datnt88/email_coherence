<s> Hi, I'm attempting to modify Amaya so that it will read files written in a markup language of my own devising.  </s>
<s> It looks like (among other things) I need to write the equivalent of html2thot.c for my language.  </s>
<s> I'd like to use html2thot.c  </s>
<s> as a guide while I do it, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the size of the file.  </s>
<s> Could someone give me an overview of the structure of this file?  </s>
<s> What are the important functions?  </s>
<s> What precisely does this file do and how does it get called?  </s>
<s> In the comments of I've noticed references to a stack and to an automaton.  </s>
<s> What are these and how do they work?  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks very much.  </s>

<s> In html2thot.c the main procedure is called StartParser.  </s>
<s> That function creates the initial document, open the file and launches the parser (HTMLparse) which scans each input character.  </s>
<s> At the first level, it uses the automaton to detect entities, start and end tags.  </s>
<s> At the second level it uses the tables of HTML elements and HTML atributes to know what Thot element or attribute type must be generated.  </s>
<s> I guess you have to build your tables there.  </s>
<s> Many other functions are there for correcting HTML errors or for adding specific work (see EndOfStartTag, EndOfEndTag).  </s>
<s> Hope that helps Irene.  </s>
<s> How are MathML and GraphML dealt with in html2thot.c? Amaya understands elements from these languages in the middle of HTML files but I can't find any much mention of them in html2thot.c.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if the best way to implement another language is to do it how MathML and GraphML are done.  </s>
<s> Again, any help will be much appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
