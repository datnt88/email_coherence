<s> I agree it is the responsibility of the working group to "identify techniques which can be used ...".  </s>
<s> But, since there clearly can by better and or worse implementations of these techniques, I believe it is the responsibility of the working group to clearly identify the "minimum required" to satisfy the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> When I filled in the matrix, I was thinking of *ALL* types and sizes of tools, and asking if "all types and sizes" of tools MUST at least implement something to satisfy that particular checkpoint - or - if it wasn't reasonable for the tool, and more if not all, of the responsibility was the author/user for that particular checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I am reviewing Charles' specific examples, and fully expect us as a working group to reach consensus.  </s>
<s> If we can't reach consensus on each of the checkpoints, how do we expect that this document will give enough guidance to the other non-participating tool developer so that they make the same conclusions as to whether or no they need to implement something to satisfy the checkpoint?  </s>
<s> Of course tool developer will need to decide on additional or different techniques that they will choose to implement to differentiate their tool from their competitors.  </s>
<s> Most likely they will use their own matrix in making these decisions.  </s>
<s> But, and quoting from Bill: "WL: I think the WG has a "responsibility" to develop certain matrices, one of which is that Phill and Charles are dealing with: a connection amongst checkpoints, priorities, and a sense of who's responsible for realizing the desired goal and whether that responsibility can be "automatically" fulfilled.  </s>
<s> WHETHER the tool developer needs to implement, not WHICH technique to implement, can and should be clearly specified in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> If we feel that there are "poor" implementation techniques which would NOT satisfy the checkpoint, we should also clearly state those are not adequate to satisfy the checkpoint.  </s>

<s> Phill, I'm happy to post stuff for the WG, (It needs to have its owner listed, and a status of the document section, but I can add those) but the turnaround can often be 24 hours - depends on whether I am awake at the time and online.  </s>
