I am attempting to compile Amaya using MS Dev Studio 6 (sp 3) on a Windows 2000 machine. 
I'm using the instructions for building using *.dsp files. 
I am at step 5, which is building Compilers. 
All of the projects compiling, but I get the following linking errors: winthotcompilers.obj 
: error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__InitCommonControls@0 winthotcompilers.obj 
: error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__CreateToolbarEx@52 .\..\bin\Compilers.exe 
: fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'link.exe' 
: return code '0x460' Stop. 
Error executing NMAKE. 
I would appreciate any insight. 
Thanks.

Hi, I suggest you to first build compilers and Amaya with files *.mak Then you could create a sibling directory WinNT where you copy all *.dsp If the first building works and not the second, you can check within the setting what misses. 
Regards Irene. 
The reason for my linking error is that "Compilers.mak" needs to include "comctl32.lib" 
in its LINK32_FLAGS line. 
I've also discovered that "libpng.mak" "libwww.mak" have hardcoded absolute CDs (change directory commands) to "\users\guetari\Amaya\Windows\zlib" and "thotprinter.mak" and "amaya.mak" 
have several hardcoded absolute and otherwise incorrect CDs and paths as well. 
But I was eventually able to get Amaya compiled and running.
