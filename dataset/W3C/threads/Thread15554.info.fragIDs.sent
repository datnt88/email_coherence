<s> Consensus was achieved on today's call to change the text that is in the guidelines to the following.  </s>
<s> This is not necessarily the final text but is basically reflects the working groups thinking at this time.  </s>
<s> Guidelines are divided into three categories of success criteria: LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup, scripting, or other technologies that interact with user agents, including assistive technologies; 2. Could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources; LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the following a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility b) content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility without requiring the user or their user agent to do anything different from users without disabilities 2. Could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources; LEVEL 3 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Go beyond Level 1 and 2 to increase direct and user agent enhanced accessibility The Working Group believes that all success criteria should be testable.  </s>
<s> Tests can be done by computer programs or by people who understand these guidelines.  </s>
<s> Tests done by people who understand the guidelines should get the same results testing the same content for the same success criteria.  </s>
<s> We also agreed to meet in Face to Face either the week of July 12th or July 19th.  </s>
<s> Venue to be determined.  </s>
<s> Currently planned for West Coast of US. Next meeting ( Fall ) being scheduled in Europe.  </s>
<s> Progress made on 1.3 but did not finish.  </s>
<s> Did point out the CSS 3 allows content to be included in style sheets -- which gives a new interpretation to "separate content from presentation".  </s>
<s> Coud you clarify this a bit?  </s>
<s> CSS 2 allows for the inclusion of content (still in CSS 2.1) and also allowed for audio content to be included in an audio presentation.  </s>
<s> I don't think it gives a new interpretation, but it does mean that defining things in terms of whether they are in CSS or HTML isn't enough - we have to talk about why something belongs in one or the other.  </s>
<s> Cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> What I meant was that we used to talk about separating presentation from content -- and used CSS as the poster child.  </s>
<s> Remove the style sheet and the page would become linear etc. but XML changed all that.  </s>
<s> Now we are also putting content in the style sheet.  </s>
<s> So the style sheet becomes part of the 'core content' and not a style sheet (as its name implies).  </s>

<s> No We are saying that L2 items would do one or the other or both.  </s>
<s> So an SC that only does one (either one) would fit.  </s>

<s> On Behalf Of Sailesh Panchang Subject: Testing definition of levels LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the following a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility b) content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility without requiring the user or their user agent to do anything different from users without disabilities Now read: Information presented using color is also available without color and without having to interpret markup (for example through context or text coding).  </s>
<s> My question: The Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3 explicitly excludes mark-up as a method of achieving accessibility.  </s>
<s> So this violates the definition of level 2 as it permits (a) or (b) or both.  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>

<s> Sailesh, I think you're right if we interpret the definition of Level 2 agreed upon at yeasterday's call as saying that all Level 2 success criteria must support *both* (a) or (b).  </s>
<s> But I think a case could be made that this particular criterion (1.3 Level 2 SC 1) meets the definition of Level 2 because it satisfies (b).  </s>
<s> In other words, it depends on the force of that either/or.  </s>
<s> I take it as meaning that it's OK to do one *or* the other; it's also OK to do both, but not necessary.  </s>
