<s> On Tuesday (the 21st) I was informed that my last day at HP will be today (the 24th).  </s>
<s> Consequently, I hereby resign from the WG.  </s>
<s> I have enjoyed working with you and wish you success!  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> Art,  </s>
<s> This is terrible news.  </s>
<s> I haven't had a chance to work out a coordinated response with Dan; I'm sure he'll reply independently.  </s>
<s> But here's my take.  </s>
<s> You are not an HP representative on the WG, you represent the W3C team and as far as I'm concerned you are still a member of the W3C team (anyone who thinks otherwise, please go on vacation) and are one of their representatives on the WG.  </s>
<s> I do not intend to accept your resignation until we have had a chance to first ensure that you did not offer it based on a misunderstanding and secondly figure out if we can work out a way that will enable you to stay with us.  </s>
<s> You are an important member of the WG.  </s>
<s> You have long experience of RDF, both practical and theoretical.  </s>
<s> You have a key role to play in developing the new specifications, not least your work on n-triples, the test cases and more just this week on the strawman test cases draft.  </s>
<s> Can I ask you please to put this on hold till we see how things work out over next days.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Hi Brian,  </s>
<s> The W3C has agreed to hire me on a contractual basis so I withdraw my resignation.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> Excellent news :-) HP's loss is W3C's gain!  </s>
<s> Glad you're still with us.  </s>
<s> --danbri  </s>
<s> Art, This is good news :)) I can't welcome you back, because you never left us.  </s>
<s> I'm so glad folks at W3C have stepped in, and as Dan says, its their gain.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
