<s> Hi all, Judy asked that I update the list of existing tools [1] so that more information is provided for each entry.  </s>
<s> She asked that I use EO's list of browsers as a model [2].  </s>
<s> It's my understanding that EO had several discussions to determine the information that ought to be provided for each entry.  </s>
<s> I have only edited the first four entries.  </s>
<s> So far, I have been including: 1. name/URL 2. who it is from 3. brief description of what it does 4. does it run locally or on the server 5. what platform does it run on is there other information we should provide for each tool?  </s>
<s> ratings?  </s>
<s> (as i did with the The Web Page Accessibility Self-Evaluation Test) usability vs. accessibility?  </s>
<s> year released?  </s>
<s> this might be harder to track since a. i'm not sure how easily this info is available for all of these, plus if they are releasing new version regularly we would have to keep this up to date.  </s>
<s> others?  </s>

<s> will you keep the organization as evaluation/repair/filter ?  </s>
<s> I suspect that some of the additional items that you list would be helpful, especially the date of the most recent version release.  </s>
<s> I would add three items to your list: 1.  </s>
<s> If server-based, is the server software available for installation on local intranets?  </s>
<s> 2. Is support available to users of the software?  </s>
<s> 3. Was the software designed to be accessible to "all" users?  </s>
<s> Althought the response to item 3 should always be yes, this sends an important message to developers who may not consider this is the design of their own software.  </s>
