Hello, Don't be scared off by the word "conformance" in the subject of this message. 
I believe this proposal simplifies the UAAG 1.0 conformance scheme. 
It does not stray far from what we have already defined, and is, I believe, a clearer model. 
The model works as follows: 1) By default, a user agent must satisfy all checkpoints in the document in order to conform. 
2) It is possible to reduce the "scope of a claim" [new term] in three ways: a) Specifying a conformance level. 
A conformance level is a labeled subset of checkpoints. 
b) Specifying one or more content type labels (more labeled subsets). 
c) Specifying input modality labels (still more labeled subsets). 
[Note: Input modality labels still a work in progress...] (These are the three mechanisms we have chosen to increase the granularity of conformance claims.) 3) By default, all checkpoints *within the scope of a claim* apply. 
A checkpoint that is in scope does not apply if any of three conditions are met. 
(Note: We may delete one based on some last call comments.) 
Why distinguish a checkpoint that is out of scope from one that does not apply? 
- A checkpoint that is out of scope is simply not part of a claim. 
The claim makes *no statement* about whether this checkpoint is satisfied or not. 
It is possible, for example, that a user agent would satisfy some, but not all, checkpoints for the "video" content type label. 
The label "video" would not appear in the claim, but the user agent would still satisfy some of the checkpoints. 
- A checkpoint that doesn't apply *is* part of a claim. 
The claim states explicitly that the user agent *does not* satisfy this checkpoint (for if it did, then the checkpoint would clearly apply). 
I think it's worthwhile making this distinction. 
I also think that doing so simplifies the presentation of the material and the definition of applicable. 
Continuing the model (essentially unchanged): 4) A well-formed claim must include information about both the scope of the claim, and for those checkpoints in scope, which ones are not considered to apply. 
(A well-formed claim must also include information about the version of UAAG and the date of the claim.) 5) A claim is valid if: a) Well-formed, and b) The subject of the claim as a whole satisfies all the applicable checkpoints that are in the scope of the claim. 
That's the model. 
Because I do not consider this a substantial change from the existing conformance model (only a clarification and simplification), I intend to integrate this into the next draft for Working Group review.

Looks good to me. 
And as I understand the model it has the nice corollary that a claim of "conformance to UAAG" (without further qualification) means, according to the spec, what we call triple-A conformance. 
Which is likely to lead to people actually thinking about what they are saying a bit more carefully, and actually getting a bit closer as a result.

Ian, I think this covers the groups current consensus on conformance. 
I agree you should add it to next draft.

Sounds reasonable to me. 
See below for a comment (labeled "EH:").

EH: I presume that the following are the three conditions: 
From 23 Oct 2000 draft: 
"The checkpoint makes requirements for graphical user interfaces or graphical viewports and the subject only has an audio or tactile user interface or viewports." 
"The checkpoint refers to a role of content (e.g., transcript, caption, text equivalent, etc.) that the subject does not recognize. 
For instance, HTML user agents can recognize "alt", OBJECT content, or NOFRAMES content as providing equivalents for other content since these are specified by the markup language. 
HTML user agents are not expected to recognize that a text description embedded without indicative markup in a nearby paragraph is a text equivalent for the image." 
"The checkpoint requires control of content properties (e.g., video or animation rate) that the subject cannot control (e.g., the format does not allow it) or does not recognize (e.g., because the property is controlled by a script in a manner that the subject cannot recognize)."

[snip] 
Yes. 
Note: I made some other changes so that the model works as a series of successive filters. 
This was tricky for content labels, which do not subtract checkpoints but add them. 
For the moment, my "solution" is that by default, a well-formed claim indicates "All" (same idea for input modalities). 
It's not ideal, but it does mean that by default all checkpoints are in scope.
