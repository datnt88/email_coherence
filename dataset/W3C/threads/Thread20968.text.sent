Running Windows 2000, Using Amaya 7.1 Release Problems: Image inserted in the wrong place, Crash Procedure: Open a local file. 
Create a new empty paragraph at the start of the document. 
Select the image button from the toolbar and add a local image. 
Problem 1: The image is inserted after the secon paragraph, not in the paragraph where the cursor was. 
Problem 2: Select the image, and use ctrl-X to cut it. 
Amaya crashes with a system warning. 
I managed to move the image in the structure view. 
Problem 3: Select the image, then select the align attribute. 
Amaya crashes with no warning I have repeated each of these crashes.

cheers Chaals Hi Charles, I played the same scenario on my Windows box and it worked well. 
I guess the version was not correctly installed. 
Could you remove all pre-installed versions and retry to install the version 7.1.

That fixed it. 
(despite getting error messages when I ran the uninstaller). 
thanks Chaals SWAD-E http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe ------------ WAI http://www.w3.org/WAI W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France Hmm. 
No, it didn't. 
It just made it intermittent.
