I propose that we add a section to the guidelines outlining resources that are available to help developers comply with the content production guideline checkpoints. 
The featured resource would probably be the ATRC/Trace A-Prompt toolkit. 
This toolkit is a software module that provides HTML accessibility checking functionality that complies with the W3C GL guidlines. 
The functionality (checkers, correcting wizards, alt-text registry) include optional pre-built interfaces to speed integration by small developers. 
However, large developers may simply call the underlying functionality within their own top level interface or use the toolkit for ideas only. 
The toolkit will be freely available soon (before the AU guidelines are completed). 
Techniques for the accessible interface guideline checkpoints should also be decribed in a parallel section.

ATRC University of Toronto We have the 'sample implementations' section, which I think matches what you are proposing. 
I think that we should continue to emphasise that the status of the material there is Techniques. 
It would make sense to put a description of the tool/suite in that appendix, and to refer to that description as a technique in each instance where it applies. 
Is there a URI for the a-prompt?

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA I think there is a difference. 
The current sample implementation section is like an examples section for the techniques. 
It contains ideas only. 
Although the a-prompt tool is a sample implementaion of sorts, it is a working system that may be built into a tool at different levels (explicit or underlying). 
If the pointer to the a-prompt goes into Sample Implementations we will have to change the intro to the section.

ATRC University of Toronto I would be happy to change the intro to the section. 
Aprompt is not the answer for everyone, it is a tool for some people (so long as it is only available in windows it is of limited use, and even as a java bean it won't fit into everyone's plans. 
It is however a very good tool for solving some problems, especially repair stuff. 
Another possibility is to give responsibility for listing it to the ER group who are responsible for tools, and point to them in the techniques. 
Certainly it seems useful for a number of techniques - if it is in a 'sample implementations' section (which I see as an appendix of widely applicable techniques - I think that is what William was saying too) we can then put a very short reference to it in specific techniques. 
One of the problems with pushing it too far is that it doesn't necessarily solve all the problems - there is still a bunch of work to be done to integrate it naturally into most authoring tools. 
(On the other hand, it counts as one itself...) That's my 2 cents worth - other folks have thoughts?
