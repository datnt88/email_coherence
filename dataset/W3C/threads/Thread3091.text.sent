I've had a go at doing a mapping between some topics from the topicexchange system to categories from the open directory. 
The mappings are online at What could such a mapping be used for? 
Well, for example, lets say I'm viewing the 'Matrix' channel on topicexchange. 
There could be a link from this page saying 'view relevant pages from dmoz'. 
The page at the end of this link could use the mapping to retrieve the pages from the dmoz categories that are most relevant to the 'Matrix' topic in topicexchange. 
Considering this kind of scenario, it occurs to me that there could be a strong argument for defining matches simply as a list, ordered by relevance. 
I'm going to call this an 'ordered' mapping. 
So I could represent the 'Matrix' mapping simply as ... Topic Exchange-- Open Directory The Matrix1. 
Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ 2. Games/Roleplaying/Genres/Science_Fiction/Matrix,_The/ 3. Games/Video_Games/Action/E/Enter_the_Matrix/ 4. Games/Video_Games/Action/Massive_Multiplayer_Online/Matrix_Online,_The/ 5. Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/ 6. Arts/Literature/Genres/Cyberpunk/ .. rather than as ... The Matrixnarrow-matchArts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ narrow-match Games/Roleplaying/Genres/Science_Fiction/Matrix,_The/ narrow-match Games/Video_Games/Action/E/Enter_the_Matrix/ narrow-match Games/Video_Games/Action/Massive_Multiplayer_Online/Matrix_Online,_The/ broad-match Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/ broad-matchArts/Literature/Genres/Cyberpunk/ ... which was the best 'traditional-style' mapping I could come up with. 
I think it would be worth having a further discussion on the 'ordered' versus 'traditional' mappings.

This probably doesn't make much sense, but... 
I see where you are going with 'ordered' mappings, but I wonder if your solution isn't a little brittle. 
I mean, having defined 6 ordered mappings, what happens when you need another, numbered say 3.5? 
A way round this would be to allow relationships between mappings. 
So a mapping to Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ is 'better' than (more relevant than? 
more specific than?) a mapping to Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/ Cheers Steve topicexchange relevance. 
The ordering does look like it could make life easier for app implementations, but- I don't think that would be a problem, simply insert the new mapping into the ordered list -the numbering isn't too important. 
But I think there are a couple of related issues - firstly the loss of the absolute relevance level (narrow-match, broad-match) might mean you end up with really weak matches being given the same significance as strong ones. 
This may not be an issue in practice - nearest is probably what you'd want while searching. 
The other potential issue is how to handle the matching up the taxo trees: relevance 1. Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ 2. Arts/Movies/Titles/M 3. Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/ 4. Arts/Movies/Genres 5. Arts/Movies/ Yep, that sounds like it could do the same job as the ordering in a (probably) more versatile fashion. 
Cheers, Danny.
