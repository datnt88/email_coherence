Greetings all, I'm looking for insight into browser/agent support for related links ( link rel="" ) in header data. 
A very primitive example is available at: I seem to recall that Lynx renders related links as hyperlinks at the top of the page? 
I'm wondering if this treatment is commonplace in other browsers, and what alternate rendering schemes people have encountered. 
Highly useful would be information on how helpful these links are to those using text-to-speech or braille oriented technologies. 
Furthermore, I suspect the various types of relative links are supported differently in each agent? 
Are there practical advantages to using link rel="bookmark" href="#search" title="Search This Website" over link rel="search" href="#search" title="Search This Website" ? 
I notice this is done on the W3C home page. 
Any disadvantages to the creative use of both? 
Any experiences or information you fine folks can share would be greatly appreciated.

No. IE does not support it. 
(Latest versions of other browsers, e.g. Netscape 7, do, although it is disabled by default in, at least, the earlier Mozilla versions that support it.) The options for Mozilla are: no-display, always display, display only if at least one is present. 
They are essentially unknown to mass market authors, so there is little precedent for their use. 
rev=made dropped out of the spec, even though it is better than meta author, which was introduced without consideration for the link mechanism. 
Quite a lot of meta keys would make sense as URLs, and therefore would be better suited to link (my own theory is that meta is mainly a way of dumping the document info from MS Word into HTML). 
These too have rather different meanings. 
I would argue that the first should only be used on "a" elements. 
Search means that you are going somewhere to do searches. 
Bookmark means that you are going direct to a sub-heading in a larger page, but is normally used as part of page that only consists of an outline of the bigger document. 
(Note that rel and rev can be use on a elements, not just link.) Same as for any abuse of markup. 
Mozilla prefers certain link types and relegates others to a second level menu. 
PS if both are relevant the code should be: rel="bookmark search" href=.... http://www.euronet.nl/~tekelenb/WWW/LINK/ 
leads you to all evidently available resources. 
rel and rev are hard to understand, one of those inordinately complex HTML attributes. 
I probably have flubbed them slightly in my book pages (and the many, many other places I use them), as here: (as also found on the book's CD-ROM), but I dunno. 
You're not gonna find many other pages online with 29 link elements. 
My pages light up nearly the entire Mozilla links toolbar. 
But until some variation of Internet Explorer begins to support this *basic* part of HTML 4, people will continue to pretend they don't exist and don't matter.
