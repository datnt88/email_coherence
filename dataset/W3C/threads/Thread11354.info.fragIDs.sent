<s> This report is on the last couple of ERB meetings, on March 8 and 12th.  </s>
<s> The majority of the time was spent on the issues (the discussion items numbered 4.*).  </s>
<s> One issue is central: can we afford to assert that all XML locators are URLs?  </s>
<s> The advantages are huge: - no need for separate locator-language machinery - web conformance.  </s>
<s> On the WWW, locators are URLS, and that's that - existing understanding and machinery There is one substantial downside: pure XML IDREFs cannot in this framework be XML Links; a URL consisting only of a Name is interpreted in URL-talk as a relative URL - you'd have to put a leading '#' in order to get IDREF behavior.  </s>
<s> You could rely on the declaration - if its declared IDREF, then you know - but this probably requires DTD processing in order to recognize links, and adds complexity; neither are good.  </s>
<s> Another issue arises, unavoidably.  </s>
<s> When a URL points into an XML doc, what does the part after the '#' mean?  </s>
<s> We have to define this.  </s>
<s> And if we are going to assert that we want to have all our pointers be URLs, then we have to explain how to squeeze TEI Xpointers into these things.  </s>
<s> This leads to the #1 problem that makes the ERB unhappy about the pure-URL idea: internationalization.  </s>
<s> We have gone to great lengths to allow the use of any sane Unicode encoding in data and markup - and yet the rules as to what can be in a URL are very restrictive; URL-encoded UTF-8 is going to be massively non-human readable.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it may be the case that browsers de facto do the right thing with the part after the '#' - for sure this doesn't get sent out over the network, so why can't it be internationalized.  </s>
<s> So maybe we could just assert that the URL-encoding is not required after the '#'.  </s>
<s> We have some action items to check out what the specs say, what people think they mean, and what the de facto behavior of popular browsers is.  </s>
<s> Summary: the ERB is leaning *very* strongly to asserting that all locators are to be URLs - and will almost certainly go this way, if we aren't thereby throwing away our nice clean international interoperability.  </s>
<s> Input welcome.  </s>

<s> If the Web architecture cannot support clean internationalization, then making all locators URLs is only an option for the first release.  </s>
<s> My guess is, this is a hole that can be exploited in the competition between the two commercial vendors of web browsers and should, therefore, be left open in some way to take advantage of the one who is able to devise a *beyond URL* solution.  </s>
<s> If IDREFs can't be links, we are invalidating a lot of existing work in SGML as well in order to accomodate a weak addressing system.  </s>
<s> It looks like URLs need some work.  </s>
<s> You should make it clear that URLs are a first version limitation only and that XML developers should be working on a stronger, more flexible, and more international solution.  </s>
<s> If they can't do this within the URL framework, then it should be replaced.  </s>

<s> Explicit link recognition needs "DTD processing" anyway, whether the ATTLIST machinery is in the external or the internal subset.  </s>
<s> (The latter is more trivial to retrieve, but no easier to process.) Given than IDREF[S] and ENTITY[IES] are usually only interesting in the cases where the relevant ATTLIST is read, I'd prefer that we sanction these as links in XML by allowing them to have the XML-LINK="LINK" on them and to dictate the "template" (that is, arch form) requirements for these attributes.  </s>
<s> If you supply just an IDREF[S] value, then it's a fragment identifier relative to the current document.  </s>
<s> If you supply an ENTITY[IES] value, then it's just an indirect way of pointing to a URL (which is what entities have to resolve to anyway, right?).  </s>
<s> The tricky part would be doing the entity-plus-ID in separate attribute values, which is a really common thing to want to do.  </s>
<s> If you supply an IDREF[S] that's intended as a fragment identifier relative to the entity, you'll get a validation error if the entity isn't the current document (though you may not care about validation errors).  </s>
<s> Perhaps, when ENTITY[IES] is supplied, the regular locator attribute value can be interpreted as the fragment identifier relative to the entity, and too bad if you don't combine them properly.  </s>
<s> FWIW, here's a concrete proposal, with a few comments/questions: o LOCATOR here is the all-powerful locator attribute.  </s>
<s> The locators that have special declared values are named after the declared values.  </s>
<s> o Does "ANY" allow the element to be declared "EMPTY"?  </s>
<s> I think we should allow this!  </s>
<s> How can we get the template/AF to indicate it?  </s>
<s> o What I mean is to allow *either* IDREF or IDREFS, and *either* ENTITY or ENTITIES.  </s>
<s> How do you do this in a template/AF?  </s>
<s> o If the element and attribute names become canonical, then perhaps DTD processing *isn't* needed in the cases where the name matches up with the declared value.  </s>

<s> I wonder what constitutes sane (or insane) Unicode encoding :-) Aparently at last week's Unicode conference in Mainz it was agreed that URLs would be allowed to contain any 10646 character providing that those outside the first 95 characters were replaced by %number representations.  </s>
<s> (I also heard that the %number concept would be extended to allow hexadecimal numbers, but I find this somewhat hard to believe without the invention of a number delimiter code or a fixed length requirement for both numbers and hex values.) Presumably the same rules will apply to fragment names as to domain and file names.  </s>

<s> The problem with URL's is really 3 problems rolled into one: 1) Naming 2) Addressing 3) Queries If the ERB emphasizes that URL's are to be used for (2), then this will be fine.  </s>
<s> Once we get (1) and (3) mixed in, URL's become an unholy mess.  </s>
<s> This was a question I asked Tim. He told me that there shouldn't be this distinction in the spec per se.  </s>
<s> I agree; this looked to me like a way to handle the implementation under COM, so it's a discussion that probably belongs on the developer's list;  </s>
<s> Tim, if someone were using a structured storage server (storages and streams in a compound document), would it not suffice for the XML client to send that server the request, have the server unpack what it needs from the compound document and return it as a file?  </s>
<s> In that case, the URLness of always getting files is unbroken and the subdocument/subelement addressing is something only the server cares about.  </s>
<s> Would that work?  </s>
<s> The bad news is the server stored files are fatter and there is overhead.  </s>
<s> Also, since the structure storage definition only contains streams and no record level management, the application server has to handle that and enforce it.  </s>
<s> Maybe an XML definition or requirement for the XML server is needed.  </s>
<s> I agree with what you are saying above, but that has always been the case with URLs as far as I know.  </s>
<s> Watching some of the discussions on the uri list, it seemed that trying to get the naming and addressing concepts into separate boxes was a fairly difficult problem.  </s>
