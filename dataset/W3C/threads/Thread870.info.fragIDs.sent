<s> Using Html tidy lib i have created a program to parse an html file, to get name of input form controls to update values to form controls , and reproduce updated html file.  </s>
<s> TidyDoc tdoc = tidyCreate(); status = tidyParseFile( tdoc, htmlfil ); //Walk through each node of Tidy doc and get input form controls and update values dump(tidyGetBody(tdoc),node); tidyRelease( tdoc );  </s>
<s> Now my problem is that tidyRelease( ); blows frequently.  </s>
<s> if tidyRelease( ) is commented it works nicely.  </s>
<s> here is my code for walking through nodes.  </s>
<s> void dump(TidyDoc tdoc,TidyNode childNode) TidyNode child; for ( child = tidyGetChild(childNode); child; child = tidyGetNext(child) ) AttVal *controlVal; AttVal *controlName; if(tidyNodeIsINPUT(child))  </s>
<s> controlName = GetAttrByName(child, "name"); controlVal = GetAttrByName(child, "value"); if(!(controlVal==null))  </s>
<s> controlVal- value = "Renjith"; else AddAttribute( tdoc, child, "value", "renjith" ); //assert( child != NULL ); if(child == null) continue; dump(tdoc,child);  </s>
<s> Hi Renjith, Your dump() function looks OK.  </s>
<s> The check for a NULL node shouldn't be necessary, as you wouldn't have entered the loop without a non-NULL value, right?  </s>
<s> So the problem is somewhere else.  </s>
<s> If you do a debug build, it should be possible to find out which function beneath tidyRelease() is causing the problem.  </s>
<s> Also, what is your compiler and platform?  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie P.S. So far, TidyLib is still read-only.  </s>
<s> Or have you added some update routines?  </s>
<s> Curious.  </s>
<s> What do you mean by `blows frequently`?  </s>
<s> Hmm, neither GetAttrByName nor AddAttribute is part of the public interface?!  </s>
