Gerhard, Thanks for letting us know, we're looking into this. 
- Judy Hello from Germany! 
I'm doing the HWG Course 'Universal Accessibility' at the moment (Week Three Reading Assignment) so I have to deal with the WCAG. 
I downloaded the 'curric.zip' 
file twice - but neither copy of the file could be opened by Winzip 7 SR1: it says 'missing 10 bytes in file' ! 
As the online costs in Germany are relativly expensive I would prefer to have the slide sets locally to read them over. 
Please try to fix the problem - or could you give me any advice how to access the downloaded 'curric.zip' with another tool to get at least the rest of the content? 
Thank you very much in advance!

Hello Gerhard, Thank you for pointing out the problem. 
The previous version of curric.zip was indeed corrupted. 
I uploaded a new version of the archive, then downloaded and tested it, and it works. 
I apologize for any inconvenience the error may have caused you.
