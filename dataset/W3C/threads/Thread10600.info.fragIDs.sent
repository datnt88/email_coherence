<s> As noted previously, I'm not expecting to be available for this telecon.  </s>
<s> Concerning:  </s>
<s> I note that there have (to my knowledge) been no further comments since the message I posted to ietf-types in November [1], so I suggest that we are ready to request IESG approval and RFC publication.  </s>
<s> There was some discussion about how to progress this: the obvious but slow route would be to request IESG approval for publication and registration, and have them hand off to the RFC editor; maybe a more lightweight approach would be to request the RFC-editor to consider publication as informational RFC, and in parallel seek IESG approval for the ietf-tree MIME type registration.  </s>
<s> I could make enquiry about this and would be happy to accept an action do so.  </s>
<s> (Aaron: I understand that the RFC editor accepts XML2RFC source documents.  </s>
<s> Could you let us have/point us at a copy of this so we can forward it at the appropriate point.)  </s>

<s> Aaron, thanks.  </s>
<s> Er, I think you mean: The "recent innovation" is not (as I understand it) an official policy, and may be relatively recent, but what I take to be a recognition on the RFC editors' part that XML2RFC saves them work in putting the document into nroff format (see [1]).  </s>
<s> Marshall Rose has put a fair amount of effort into making the XML2RFC output compliant with their editorial policy.  </s>
