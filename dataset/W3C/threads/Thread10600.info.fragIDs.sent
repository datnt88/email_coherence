There will be a telecon this week. 
On my list of possibles, I have: consider changes to semantics doc consdier changes to primer 
status of mimetypes doc 
advice to CG on postponed issues 
anything else on the todo list schema for datatypes? 
review of TAG's web architecture document 
Other suggestions welcome.

As noted previously, I'm not expecting to be available for this telecon. 
Concerning: 
I note that there have (to my knowledge) been no further comments since the message I posted to ietf-types in November [1], so I suggest that we are ready to request IESG approval and RFC publication. 
There was some discussion about how to progress this: the obvious but slow route would be to request IESG approval for publication and registration, and have them hand off to the RFC editor; maybe a more lightweight approach would be to request the RFC-editor to consider publication as informational RFC, and in parallel seek IESG approval for the ietf-tree MIME type registration. 
I could make enquiry about this and would be happy to accept an action do so. 
(Aaron: I understand that the RFC editor accepts XML2RFC source documents. 
Could you let us have/point us at a copy of this so we can forward it at the appropriate point.)

Concerning: 
I am about half way through a review of this, and so far I haven't noticed anything that I think is an RDFcore concern. 
Concerning: 
I remind folks of my earlier comments [2].

This must be a recent innovation. 
The latest XML draft is at 
-02.xml Aaron Swartz: http://www.aaronsw.com/ 
Aaron, thanks. 
Er, I think you mean: The "recent innovation" is not (as I understand it) an official policy, and may be relatively recent, but what I take to be a recognition on the RFC editors' part that XML2RFC saves them work in putting the document into nroff format (see [1]). 
Marshall Rose has put a fair amount of effort into making the XML2RFC output compliant with their editorial policy. 
(Now, if we had a version that would generate W3C pubrules-compliant HTML ;-) #g [1] http://lists.xml.resource.org/pipermail/xml2rfc/2003-November/000957.html
