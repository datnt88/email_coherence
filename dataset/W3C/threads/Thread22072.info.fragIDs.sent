I'm trying to generate the latests dom3.dtd with the testsuite. 
To do that I downloaded: The zipfiles are ok but don't contain the xml-source.zip 
This is probably because this is not a public draft.......... 
The current public draft is really old (over 6 months, no DOMConfiguration etc). 
It would make sense to add the xml-source.zip to the latest (non public) draft so that we can build tests against the latests drafts. 
What is the next publication date ?

2002/10 is not a public draft. 
As said at the f2f, our current set of changes to do on Core and LS is too important so it's better to wait to update the public version instead of updating them now and republishing in less than a month. 
I changed the generation process 5 months ago. 
You'll find a file called xml-source.xml now, instead of xml-source.zip. 
It (almost) guarantees that I don't forget a file when generating the public version. 
Is "as soon as possible" acceptable? 
:) More seriously, the editors (including myself) are late on their action items but we'll do our best to be as much up-to-date as possible before the technical plenary (beginning of March).

mmm, 
The testsuite build assumes an xml-source.zip 
Let me have a look at the build.xml 
again. 
This probably means that the definitions subdirectory which contained DOMBuilder.xml is no longer needed ?

Correct. Philippe 
I updated the build.xml 
and dom3-combine.xsl 
last night to change to the last public draft and to use xml-source.xml 
instead of xml-source. 
You will need to clean out your lib/spec directory since the build file will assume that any zip file in there is up to date. 
Ok, I've changed my build.xml 
as follows to handle this: change: unzip src="${specs.dir}/Level-3/LS/xml-source.zip" dest="${specs.dir}/Level-3/xml/ls"/ into: copy file="${specs.dir}/Level-3/LS/xml-source.xml" tofile="${specs.dir}/Level-3/xml/ls/dom-spec.xml"/ which works ok. 
This needs to be changed to the build.xml 
of the test suite after the next public release. 
The same thing counts for Core. 
With Core there used to be a patchfile that replaced element.xml 
which is no longer available. 
I'n not sure whether the patchfile is still needed ... Jeroen
