Since IE and Communicator do not position the CAPTION element consistently between them, authors have found other ways to create captions that look nice. 
suggestions include using nested tables or images to position the caption. 
ugh. 
refer to the article at http://webreview.com/pub/98/02/27/tag/index.html --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa The "align" attribute is legal, but deprecated in HTML 4.01. 
There is no "valign" attribute on the CAPTION element. 
And no discussion of the CSS2 property 'caption-side' and other positioning properties.

align=left and align=right should put the caption on the left and right of the table, not on top. 
There is no need for nested tables to imitate the correct behavior. 
For example in case of align=left one can create the first cell to span a whole column, and put the text of the would be caption there. 
In http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html we find "align = top|bottom|left|right [CI] Deprecated. 
For visual user agents, this attribute specifies the position of the caption with respect to the table. 
Possible values: * top: The caption is at the top of the table. 
This is the default value. 
* bottom: The caption is at the bottom of the table. 
* left: The caption is at the left of the table. 
* right: The caption is at the right of the table."

That may mean that you want it under the table just like the captions for images are laid out in your document. 
It would be nice to have means in CSS to be able to easily position an object relative to another object. 
Positioning with flow becomes complicated with several objects (when you don't want to structure mark-up according to layout needs). 
Or maybe I just haven't found the right example of how to do it.
