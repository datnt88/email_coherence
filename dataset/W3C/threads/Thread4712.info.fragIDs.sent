<s> Chapter 20 of the XSLT 2.0 draft defines rules for using a default output method in case the method attribute isn't specified.  </s>
<s> These rules essentially detect HTML or XHTML.  </s>
<s> I wonder why there isn't a similar rule for text: if the output doesn't contain a single root element but rather starts with plain text then the text output method could be chosen.  </s>

<s> I don't know why the decision was made this way, but since the XML output method does allow the creation of external general parsed entities, in which the first node can be a text node, I think it would be unwise to change the default at this stage.  </s>
<s> Regards, Michael Kay  </s>
<s> I seems to be quite arbitrarily to infer the HTML method from a html element, but not to infer the text method from pure text ... The user can always specify an output method, so producing external entities is still possible.  </s>
<s> However, it would break backwards compatibility, and that is probably the main obstacle.  </s>
