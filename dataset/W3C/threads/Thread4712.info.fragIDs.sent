Chapter 20 of the XSLT 2.0 draft defines rules for using a default output method in case the method attribute isn't specified. 
These rules essentially detect HTML or XHTML. 
I wonder why there isn't a similar rule for text: if the output doesn't contain a single root element but rather starts with plain text then the text output method could be chosen.

I don't know why the decision was made this way, but since the XML output method does allow the creation of external general parsed entities, in which the first node can be a text node, I think it would be unwise to change the default at this stage.

I seems to be quite arbitrarily to infer the HTML method from a html element, but not to infer the text method from pure text ... The user can always specify an output method, so producing external entities is still possible. 
However, it would break backwards compatibility, and that is probably the main obstacle.
