<s> Thanks for taking the time to look at the matrix again.  </s>
<s> Differentiating between pseudo-analysis and develop is tricky.  </s>
<s> Both are for research.  </s>
<s> Both are not supposed to identify the individual.  </s>
<s> The conceptual difference is that pseudo-analysis involves the creation of a (pseudonymous) profile of an individual (and thus lends itself to researching things that require tracking an individual's use of a service, for example), while develop does not involve the creation of a profile.  </s>
<s> So that's why I used the term "record identified with you."  </s>
<s> The new wording that you propose for develop could describe pseudo-analysis equally well.  </s>
<s> Any other ideas?  </s>
<s> For computer you proposed: "Information about the computer you are using.  </s>
<s> Such as its hardware, software, or internet address."  </s>
<s> If you change the .  </s>
<s> to a , and make it "Information about the computer you are using, such as its hardware, software, or internet address."  </s>
<s> I would be happy with that.  </s>
