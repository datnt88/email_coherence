<s> Someone is not closing file descriptors explicitly and resources pressure pushes the problem to the point where more files cannot be opened.  </s>

<s> Mike May The Source be with you.  </s>
<s> The DOM test suite code generation is a stress test for XSLT procecessors.  </s>
<s> I don't think we were able to use Xerces-J 2.3 to build dom-ts, but had to use 2.2.  </s>
<s> I've also had success with SAXON 6.5, but others have had problems.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the analysis.  </s>
<s> I'll take a look at the Ant source and see if I see anything obvious.  </s>

<s> First, sorry for the duplicate message.  </s>
<s> I *thought* I sent this mail message but I didn't see it after almost a day.  </s>
<s> I think my ISP is having issues.  </s>
<s> Regarding this problem, I don't have any hard evidence that it's Ant but when I ran into this problem I built each domts case independently with a simple shell script for j in loop.  </s>
<s> It took 15 minutes but it worked.  </s>
<s> So there's nothing particularly twisted about any one xml test case.  </s>
<s> It's just when Ant is brought into the fray that there  </s>
<s> are problems.  </s>
<s> At the very least there would probably be a way to free resources more agressively.  </s>
<s> The Ant task could totally reinitialize the XSLT processor at every opportunity.  </s>
<s> If that worked without seeing anything obviously wrong with that task that's pretty good evidence to take to the Xalan people.  </s>
<s> Mike May The Source be with you.  </s>
<s> My experience with the DOM TS and Xalan: I used xalan-j_2_2_D11 last time I built, all other version of Xalan gave me problems.  </s>
<s> However, this version does not seem to be available (http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/old/). /Dimitris  </s>
