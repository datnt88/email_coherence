I want to create a constant in my CSS file so that I can change all affected 
properties in one place. 
For example, in order to provide alternative schemes one might assign a constants "myfontsize", "myfontcolor". 
I thought I'd seen something like @define somewhere but can't find anything about it now. 
Can this be done and if so how please? 
Cheers

See rejections of this proposal on the www-style list. 
Amongst reasons for rejecting it are the need to do this implies that you are using styles capriciously, which just confuses users; for styles used systematically, the cascading rules and the ability to have alternative selector seequences for the same set of rules should avoid any great need for this, especially in an accessibility context, where you should be using a small number of style in a way that reflects the structure. 
A friend of mine has a word for questions like this. 
That word is probably best transcribed as "g'neh!" (I'll be curious to find out what screen-readers make of that :) It roughly translates to "I know an answer to that question, but I'm not sure it would be wise for you to use it." 
In general such a @define rule would be a bad thing. 
I can however see a case for something like that where the CSS is meant to respond to instructions from someone other than the person who coded it (in particular, instructions from someone who doesn't know how to code CSS). 
In such cases you can use something like ASP or similar to create the CSS on-the-fly, and get most of the benefits of the @define: paragraph { color: %=colour_const_or_function% ; That said in a well-written CSS there should be relatively little duplication of values (as David points out), so if you are only using constants here it may be wise to re-examine the CSS entirely. 
If you do use an on-the-fly solution remember to use Last-Modified and cache control so you don't have to generate it for every use.
