<s> I've just spent a few hours reviewing this list's archive and managed to answer almost all of my questions about NodeLists.  </s>
<s> Damn they're weird.  </s>
<s> ;) There was one question to which I couldn't find an answer, though:  </s>
<s> Since a NodeList is a "live view" into the tree, what does nextSibling do on  </s>
<s> items in a NodeList?  </s>
<s> It would seem like it should return the next sibling in  </s>
<s> the tree, not the next sibling in the NodeList.  </s>
<s> However, that makes stepping  </s>
<s> through items in an "abstract" NodeList (like that generated from getElementsByTagName) a little difficult.  </s>
<s> I haven't looked at DOM2 yet, but I  </s>
<s> imagine that this problem is solved by iterators.  </s>

<s> Once you know, you know.  </s>
<s> When you've fetched a Node out of a NodeList, it doesn't know it was *in* a NodeList, so nextSibling is the Node on its right in the tree, not its successor in the list.  </s>
<s> Use the index method, being careful to note what you are doing (i.e. if you are removing each node as you find it, always ask for index(0) each time).  </s>

<s> getNextSibling() called on a Node returned from an iterator, a NodeList, etc. should return its sibling in the tree.  </s>
<s> getNext (or whatever we call it) on an iterator will return the next node in the set being iterated over.  </s>
<s> There is no "next" operation on a NodeList; you get the next by incrementing the index passed to the item() method.  </s>
<s> I prefer to think of all NodeLists (and iterators) as abstract references into the tree rather than physical lists into which nodes are copied from the tree.  </s>
