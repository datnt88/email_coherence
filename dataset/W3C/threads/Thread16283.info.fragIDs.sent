Are there standards for Access Key. 
By that I mean are there universally 
accepted letters for actions... 
Thank you for your response. 
I am waiting for other readers on this list tell us about complications with assistive technologies.

accesskeys? Yes, it is important to avoid conflicts with the browser's 
shortcut 
keys. 
If there are conflicts, anybody who uses keyboard 
only 
techniques to access menus -- including people who are 
blind, have low 
vision, or certain mobility impairments -- will get very 
frustrated! 
In general, you can choose as accesskeys any letter or 
number that is 
NOT used by any of the major graphic-based browsers. 
For 
example, you 
should avoid Alt +F, E, H because these keystroke 
combinations are 
almost universally used for File, Edit, and Help 
respectively. 
If you 
check all of the recent versions of all of the major 
browsers, you may 
find that the set of available accesskeys is quite small. 
There may be an additional complication that can arise from 
using 
accesskeys. 
However, this is pure speculation; I don't know 
for 
certain. 
Certain access applications may use Alt key 
combinations that 
could conflict with accesskeys. 
I can't think of any such 
programs off 
the top of my head, but perhaps other readers on this list 
may know of 
screen readers or text enhancers or other assistive 
technologies that 
appropriate unusual Alt key combinations to perform 
particular tasks. 
(My guess is that a few Windows-based assistive 
technologies would use 
the Alt key as a modifier.) Alan Alan Cantor Cantor + Associates Workplace Accommodation Consultants acantor@interlog.com

Hi Robert, Then I think about how implement ACCESSKEYs: I avoid the ACCESSKEYs that can create problems in English and the language of the pages -a lot of people use the last version of the browsers (in english) before it has been translated to another languages-. 
For example: I avoid the ACCESSKEYs: F:file, H:help, E:edit and A:archivo, V:ayuda E:edicion for Spanish version of a site. 
ACCESSKEYs don?t work with very much browsers and operating systems but I think that these are very useful for very much people.
