<s> Hi Robert, Then I think about how implement ACCESSKEYs: I avoid the ACCESSKEYs that can create problems in English and the language of the pages -a lot of people use the last version of the browsers (in english) before it has been translated to another languages-.  </s>
<s> For example: I avoid the ACCESSKEYs: F:file, H:help, E:edit and A:archivo, V:ayuda E:edicion for Spanish version of a site.  </s>
<s> ACCESSKEYs don?t work with very much browsers and operating systems but I think that these are very useful for very much people.  </s>
