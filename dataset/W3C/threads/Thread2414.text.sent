I personally think it would be better if there were a common registry for 'headers' that included the list of which were useful in HTTP, EMail, NetNews, within particular multipart types, etc. 
I think it would help in future coordination between extensions of mail, news, other kinds of 'push', etc. Do you support using the same registry for HTTP and other applications of MIME? 
Larry A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories. 
This draft is a work item of the Detailed Revision/Update of Message Standards Working Group of the IETF. 
Title: Mail and Netnews Header Registration Procedure Author(s): J. Palme Filename: draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-02.txt 
Pages: 9 Date: 24-Nov-97 Various IETF standards and e-mail and netnews software products use various e-mail and netnews header fields. 
This document specifies a procedure for the registration of e-mail and netnews header field names, to reduce the risk that two different products use the same header name in different ways (homonyms) or that several different header names are used with identical meaning (synonyms).

In the body type: "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-02.txt". 
NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net 
can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility. 
To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command. 
To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader. 
Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages. 
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft. 
I think that Larry's point is a good one but the problem is somewhat deeper. 
The problem is that the RFC structure does not really support the layered nature of the protocols, nor is the need for continuing extensions handled at all well. 
The area in which this is most apparent is NNTP where almost half the 'de-facto' NNTP standard has been outside the IETF process for a decade. 
The recent NNTP extensions work has thus been preformed in a remedial rather than a pro-active fashion. 
Two models to bear in mind, the UK and US legislative processes. 
The RFC process is basically that of the UK parliament. 
Bills correspond to Internet drafts. 
They can be introduced by any member at any time and have no weight. 
RFCs correspond to 'Acts' - i.e. fully processed and approved bills that have made it thorugh the committee cycle. 
Except that RFCs also include documents that would in the UK system be considered 'orders in council' 'white papers' and all the rest of parliamentary clutter. 
The US legislative system is rather different in that the acts passed are essentially a set of editing instructions for another document, a consolidated statement of the law. 
This is essentially the French Revolutionary model, impose a uniform code. 
The advantage of this second model is that it allows much more scope for 'tweakage' of an extant spec. 
Additional headers can be specified and added into the general mix without having to re-issue every spec that is dependent on them. 
For example consider the Digest Authentication Spec, should it dock or not? 
Ideally I would like to be able to 'dock' specifications of this type after the HTTP/1.1 spec has been fully approved and without re-opening HTTP. 
The case of specs that cross working group boundaries makes a mechanism of this type even more important. 
For example the MIME group would never accept the real and legitimate objections of the HTTP community that since HTTP is 8-bit clean it was imperative that a content length engoding be allowed. 
What was actually a transport issue (SMTP implementations are habitually broken meaning that content-length is not stable) became a structural imperative. 
As much of the communications infrastructure becomes embedded in the operating system it becomes even more important to systematize the means by which facilities can be added to the general infrastructure while taking account of the specific limtations of particular protocols. 
So a possible new structure for RFCs would be as a set of editing instructions. 
The protocol headers (or whatever) would be specifie with a description for each. 
Then another section would discuss the applicability of the headers to each of the MIME based transport protocols SMTP, NNTP and HTTP. 
Some centralized document would be maintained with a structure designed to allow component-wise editing (i.e. the addition of additional chunks). 
There might be cross references in this document so that additional rationale for a particular change might be found in an acompanying RFC.. In short this is not a simple 'registration' function but a fundamental change in the way the IETF operates. 
It would have many advantages, in particular avoiding the repetative re-writing of introductory material which may or may not contain substantive changes. 
The problem is getting agreement to make such a change. 
There are still folk that turn purple at the heretical suggestion that RFCs should be issued in HTML. 
Their rationale being based on a bad experience with postscript. 
One ill fated experiment in the middle ages having proved that for all time there can be no improvement on ASCII text. 
This is why every single person down in Washington the week after next will carry at least one RFC which has been misprinted. 
And don't think for a moment that the response that everyone will give to proposals for change is to agree with them but lament at great length that they wont be changed. 
Such things are the spark of revolutions. 
Phill That sounds like a good idea to me. 
I think Jacob Palme has already started such a registry for the email realm, and I suspect he might be happy to expand its scope. 
Alex Hopmann Microsoft Corporation Here, here (or should that be "hear hear"?) I find there there seems to be much discussion about the cross-overs between protocols, so having a mechanism which avoids using the same name for different purposes in different protocols seems like a good start. 
And should there also be some equivalent to the "vnd" tree in MIME, for strictly private protocol use?
