If an option element contains an illegal font element followed by whitespace and some text, 08-Jul-2000 Tidy eats the whitespace, causing words to run into each other. 
I'm temporarily working around this by having ParseText change the mode from IgnoreWhitespace to MixedContent when the illegal font is detected, but I'm not so sure that's the right fix.

Me neither. 
Worse example (since font is treated special): gives us Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "space-munge-in-select.t" line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element line 2 column 26 - Warning: discarding unexpected span line 2 column 32 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 2 column 37 - Warning: discarding unexpected /span line 2 column 45 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 2 column 56 - Warning: discarding unexpected /option line 3 column 26 - Warning: discarding unexpected span line 3 column 32 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 3 column 36 - Warning: discarding unexpected /span line 3 column 44 - Warning: discarding unexpected plain text line 3 column 55 - Warning: discarding unexpected /option line 4 column 1 - Warning: missing /select space-munge-in-select.t:

Using MixedContent seems like a reasonable solution. 
I think it is worth extending ParseText to discard all inline tags not just font. 
For textarea, is it worth escaping all instances of  and &amp; in the content? 
Isolated ones will be already, but what about the case where the users will be allowed to type markup in to the textarea box, and the author wants to include some as the default value for the field.
