I am not really sure if this falls in the DOM area, so apologies in advance, just in case this is off-topic. 
The early versions of Netscape added the "alert()" (and similar) methods to the build-in JavaScript functions. 
After +/- 5 years, this is still the only cross-browser (DOM0?) method of displaying dialogs. 
All graphical platforms I know of support the notion of "modal" and "modeless" dialogs. 
The serialization format for these "forms" would of course be HTML. 
Are there any plans for incorporating functionality like this in to a future DOM spec? 
Regards, Taras future I don't think there are any plans. 
As far as I know, it isn't something we've looked at in detail. 
Alerts seem to be part of the information/decoration surrounding a presentation of the document (which I believe some folks have referred to as the tool's "chrome"), rather than part of the document per se. 
So personally I'm inclined to consider them out of the scope of the Document Object Model and refer this question to another committee. 
But it's possible that the Views And Formatting editorial team might want to make this part of their work; that's the portion of the DOM which comes closest to discussing rendering and presentation. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research The dialog could be seen as just another document. 
The relevant methods (something like "showDialog(...)" and a way to return, say, a ECMAScript object as a result from the dialog) just provide a very thin connection between the two documents. 
I see that functionality like this is on the border of the DOM. 
But as it is, none of the current w3 groups will take it, while there is a great potentian for improvement of functionality.
