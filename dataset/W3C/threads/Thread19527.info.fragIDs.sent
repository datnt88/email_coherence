<s> Using the patch from Don Croyle I was able to build Amaya RPMs for Linux on the i386, sparc and alpha platforms.  </s>

<s> Tried these on Intel, Alpha, and Sparc using RH5.1 + updates (Alpha) and RH 5.2 (Intel and Sparc).  </s>
<s> They work fine except for one problem - jpegs wouldn't display.  </s>
<s> Amaya 1.x works fine on the same machines (and displays jpegs).  </s>
<s> Anyone else have this problem?  </s>

<s> RPM distributions are not managed by the Amaya team.  </s>
<s> I guess these distributions don't include the library libjpeg.  </s>
<s> Perhaps your current version of that library is incompatible with Amaya includes.  </s>
<s> Our binary distribution for Linux uses a static library and should display jpegs correctly.  </s>
<s> Could you check that?  </s>
