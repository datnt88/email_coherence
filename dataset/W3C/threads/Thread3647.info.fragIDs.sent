<s> This is a question I have received at IUC26 as well as by mail: What to do about characters in Unicode that are not allowed in XML?  </s>
<s> (examples would be various C0 control codes) This is not an HTML- or CSS-related question, but I hope it is okay to have such questions, too.  </s>
<s> If it is okay, I'll prepare a draft.  </s>

<s> 1) We decided at the last meeting not to have a telecon this week, since Richard was out.  </s>
<s> 2) We should update this FAQ now that XML 1.1 is a rec and not a candidate rec.  </s>
<s> 3) The question that Martin was asked, is a little broader than control codes.  </s>
<s> It might be good to have an additional FAQ that addresses the gamut of disallowed chars.  </s>
<s> (non-NFC, PUA, chars not recommended for names (XML 1.1 Appendix I), unassigned chars, chars not in Unicode, etc)...  </s>
<s> Or maybe they should be several FAQs.  </s>
