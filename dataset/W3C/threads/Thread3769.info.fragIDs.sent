<s> I've let this drift for some time (as is my bad habit:-), but I'd like to introduce the XML validator into W3C CVS.  </s>
<s> Olivier organised my CVS access, and that appears to work fine.  </s>
<s> Since the XML validator is entirely separate from "the" validator, I think xml-val should be created as a new top-level project.  </s>
<s> Any problems with that?  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Nick,  </s>
<s> Good.  </s>
<s> This sounds good.  </s>
<s> However, I've been told the current practice is to use "dated space", so the xml-validator should be under dev.w3.org:/sources/public/2003/xml-val(idator).  </s>
<s> Thanks. Olivier  </s>
<s> OK, I've imported it into dev.w3.org:/sources/public/2003/xml-val  </s>
<s> I'm perpetually struggling with CVS, so I hope it's imported OK.  </s>
<s> This is currently a pretty minimal import, but it's what's running at qa-dev.w3.org:8888 and now also at valet.webthing.com/xml-val/  </s>
<s> At valet, I have an XML catalogue I constructed myself.  </s>
<s> For W3, I want to investigate the XML components of our SGMLIB package, and feed it to the validator.  </s>
<s> This remains subject to round tuits, and if anyone's actually installed something on qa-dev, it'll save a lot of work if you let me know so I can just configure xml-val to use it.  </s>
<s> Regards,  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Nick.  </s>
<s> Looks OK from here.  </s>
<s> Do you have, or need, people playing with it at this stage, other than just the small qa-dev group?  </s>
<s> There's no guarantee of course, but we could ask people from the XML community at W3C to test it...  </s>
<s> I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> I don't remember how far we went in our discussions about sgml-lib...  </s>
<s> Olivier  </s>
<s> Watch this space.  </s>
<s> And hassle me if I go quiet on it.  </s>
<s> I certainly have issues with it.  </s>
<s> One is to improve the output: for that I need to hack in to Xerces itself to extract the info I'm looking for (unless someone has a better idea).  </s>
<s> Another is setting up the XML catalogue and lib - and that's something I'd really like help with (I could just copy stuff from Valet, but I *know* that's a homebrew and has gaps in it).  </s>
<s> Apart from that, I'd really like to see it tested properly - Eg for those of you in .jp,  </s>
<s> does it cope with CJK?  </s>
<s> And do we have a test corpus anywhere?  </s>
<s> Bjoern has been my best critic, but neither he nor I can expect to see everything.  </s>
<s> Anyone? Nick Kew  </s>
