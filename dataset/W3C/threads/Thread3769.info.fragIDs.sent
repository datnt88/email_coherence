I've let this drift for some time (as is my bad habit:-), but I'd like to introduce the XML validator into W3C CVS. 
Olivier organised my CVS access, and that appears to work fine. 
Since the XML validator is entirely separate from "the" validator, I think xml-val should be created as a new top-level project. 
Any problems with that? 
Nick Kew 
Nick, 
Good. 
This sounds good. 
However, I've been told the current practice is to use "dated space", so the xml-validator should be under dev.w3.org:/sources/public/2003/xml-val(idator). 
Thanks. Olivier 
OK, I've imported it into dev.w3.org:/sources/public/2003/xml-val 
I'm perpetually struggling with CVS, so I hope it's imported OK. 
This is currently a pretty minimal import, but it's what's running at qa-dev.w3.org:8888 and now also at valet.webthing.com/xml-val/ 
At valet, I have an XML catalogue I constructed myself. 
For W3, I want to investigate the XML components of our SGMLIB package, and feed it to the validator. 
This remains subject to round tuits, and if anyone's actually installed something on qa-dev, it'll save a lot of work if you let me know so I can just configure xml-val to use it. 
Regards, 
Nick Kew 
Nick. 
Looks OK from here. 
Do you have, or need, people playing with it at this stage, other than just the small qa-dev group? 
There's no guarantee of course, but we could ask people from the XML community at W3C to test it... 
I'm not sure. 
I don't remember how far we went in our discussions about sgml-lib... 
Olivier 
Watch this space. 
And hassle me if I go quiet on it. 
I certainly have issues with it. 
One is to improve the output: for that I need to hack in to Xerces itself to extract the info I'm looking for (unless someone has a better idea). 
Another is setting up the XML catalogue and lib - and that's something I'd really like help with (I could just copy stuff from Valet, but I *know* that's a homebrew and has gaps in it). 
Apart from that, I'd really like to see it tested properly - Eg for those of you in .jp, 
does it cope with CJK? 
And do we have a test corpus anywhere? 
Bjoern has been my best critic, but neither he nor I can expect to see everything. 
Anyone? Nick Kew
