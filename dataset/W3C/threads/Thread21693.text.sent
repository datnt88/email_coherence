I made these notes for IRC chat, but I might as well post them here on the mailing list: Bryce Benton, full-time php/mysql/accessibility/web standards employee of Texas Center for Educational Technology (TCET [1]) housed at the University of North Texas -- Denton, Texas). 
I am also pursuing a Masters degree in Technical Writing. 
There is a chance that the semantic photo project could become part of my degree. 
I am still early in my degree progress, so there is room to shape it and possibly earn some credit or develop a thesis around semantic photo annotation. 
Additionally, I have some university contacts that may be insightful in terms of usability/accessibility. 
I would like to volunteer to Web Standards-ize the existing site[2]. 
Primarily, this would mean moving away from tables for layout. 
This would also make for pages that load more quickly and are more accessible. 
There are also a few spelling mistakes that should be corrected. 
There are also some spelling mistakes, in the .pdf 
file. 
I updated the Wiki page[3] with a couple of ideas. 
See very bottom of page. 
--bryce p.s. In my spare time, I work on adding to and improving years of our marriage.

We should probably all try to introduce ourselves over this week. 
It would be *great* if you could help convert the Front Door site to web standards, including accessibility! 
Thank you! 
And from there, help keep the whole project to web standards. 
Let's chat this afternoon or tomorrow and get you access to the pages.

Subscribe Instructions Body: subscribe Unsubscribe Instructions Body: unsubscribe Help Body: help Hi all, I'm a researcher in the Next Media Group at Microsoft Research. 
My background is all over the map - I did undergraduate in Neurosciences at Brown University, a Masters in robotics at the MIT AI lab, and a PhD in computer graphics at the MIT Media Lab. 
I've been at Microsoft Research for 8 years now and worked on a variety of projects ranging from social computing, avatars, interactive TV, to image processing. 
I've been doing a lot of interface work and most recently have done a series of projects on organizing and annotating photos and videos. 
I've called a lot of the projects consumer level data visualization. 
My web page is http://research.microsoft.com/~sdrucker. 
I've been swamped for the past few weeks and am heading into another heavy week for trying to get a SIGGRAPH paper done, but I'll try to kibitz here and there when I can! Seems like a great projects with a lot of interesting people involved!

On Behalf Of Antonio Cavedoni Hello there, Good idea. 
My name is Antonio Cavedoni and some of you may already know me (Libby, Dan: hey there!). 
I am an Italian student, writer, Web developer and designer, and have been quite interested in RDF and the Semantic Web in the last year and a half: I even spent six months in Bristol! - though completely unrelated to any SemWeb stuff. 
I am currently working on a small project to integrate the archives of a mailing list I manage with FOAF profiles for the list members, and of course I have been thinking about writing an RDF image gallery program for quite a while, though I'm still pondering how to do it in a decent way. 
I code in PHP, Python, JavaScript (and ActionScript) and have done some work in XSLT as well. 
I have also been doing a good amount of work in (X)HTML, CSS and web accessibility stuff, so I think I can help with those if needed. 
Thanks for listening.
