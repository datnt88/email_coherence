<s> Hello guys I'm new in this list and may be what I'll say is an old grievous story discussed many times in this list, but:  </s>
<s> Many people use Server Side Include in their work, either in pure SHTML or ASP  </s>
<s> or whatever.  </s>
<s> That would be AWESOME if Tidy could parse included files.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that it should not modify included files or, at least,  </s>
<s> that should be an option.  </s>
<s> Good example of what i'm talking about is a standard header and footer for all pages, looking like following: ssiStdHeader.txt:  </s>
<s> ssiStdFooter.txt:  </s>
<s> SomeFile.shtm:  </s>
<s> When tidy parses this file you know it adds empty TITLE at the beginning and /BODY at the end of file.  </s>
<s> So I have to remove them each time I clean up my HTML with Tidy.  </s>
<s> I did not look at Tidy sources yet, but  </s>
<s> I guess that would be very easy to implement SSI support in it.  </s>
<s> Any opinions how to do that without modifying Tidy ?  </s>

<s> Hello Egor,  </s>
<s> with minor modifications, you could use the PERL wrapper for tidy that I am currently writing.  </s>
<s> It should do what you want - parse and correct the content of your shtml-file and strip tidy's added document tags.  </s>
<s> I am going to think a bit about how to make more flexible, thus more  </s>
<s> suitable for your needs, and implement that then...  </s>
<s> I expect it to be done by Friday or the following Monday.  </s>

<s> Sebastian Lange Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML 4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.  </s>
<s> Courtesy to Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy:  </s>
<s> Thank you Sebastian I'm not very familiar w/Perl, but I think this solves my problem.  </s>
<s> Anyway this is one more wish for next version of Tidy to include built-in SSI support.  </s>

<s> Egor, I too work mostly with SSI's.  </s>
<s> The script that Sebastian Lang is working on is a polished function that will do what you want.  </s>
<s> Until his is ready for prime-time, you can use the attached Perl script.  </s>
<s> I call it "stidy"; it's a fairly crude solution but it's a functional utility that does exactly what you need.  </s>
<s> It basically just runs Tidy on your file, then strips out all document-level tags.  </s>
<s> I've been using it quite successfully for almost a week to clean up my SSI/CGI programs.  </s>
<s> Usage is simple and mimic's Tidy's: stidy inputFile.txt   </s>
<s> outputFile.txt  </s>
<s> Notes: It's only a wrapper, so I didn't bother getting very elaborate with options; (just use -c to specify your Tidy's config file and you can use all your favorite Tidy options).  </s>
<s> As such, I did add two options for xhtml/indentation, respectively, because I personally toggle those two a lot from the command line...  </s>
<s> Just run stidy -h for help/usage.  </s>
<s> Comments in the script are self-explanatory.  </s>
<s> - I don't know if this works under Windows or not.  </s>
<s> I can't see any reason for it not to, but I haven't bothered to trying... Perhaps you can play with/improve it and send feedback to the list, myself and most importantly Sebastian, so he can incorporate any input into his final, program.  </s>
<s> Enjoy!  </s>
<s> (Hey Sebastian: this version has a few minor changes from the one I sent you yesterday.) ~pete  </s>
<s> Egor I'm not very familiar w/Perl, but I think this solves my problem.  </s>
<s> In that case, you'll want to go to: and download the latest version of Perl.  </s>
<s> It's free of course.  </s>
<s> After you install it, make sure things are OK but typing this on commnad-line: perl -v If you get some version output then things are OK.  </s>
<s> I notice from your e-mail header that you are using Windows, so to run the perl scripts we sent you, just open a DOS window and type: c:\ perl stidy inFile.txt   </s>
<s> outFile.txt  </s>
<s> Hope this helps... ~pete  </s>
