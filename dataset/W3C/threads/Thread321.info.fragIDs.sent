Hello guys I'm new in this list and may be what I'll say is an old grievous story discussed many times in this list, but: 
Many people use Server Side Include in their work, either in pure SHTML or ASP 
or whatever. 
That would be AWESOME if Tidy could parse included files. 
My understanding is that it should not modify included files or, at least, 
that should be an option. 
Good example of what i'm talking about is a standard header and footer for all pages, looking like following: ssiStdHeader.txt: 
ssiStdFooter.txt: 
SomeFile.shtm: 
When tidy parses this file you know it adds empty TITLE at the beginning and /BODY at the end of file. 
So I have to remove them each time I clean up my HTML with Tidy. 
I did not look at Tidy sources yet, but 
I guess that would be very easy to implement SSI support in it. 
Any opinions how to do that without modifying Tidy ?

Hello Egor, 
with minor modifications, you could use the PERL wrapper for tidy that I am currently writing. 
It should do what you want - parse and correct the content of your shtml-file and strip tidy's added document tags. 
I am going to think a bit about how to make more flexible, thus more 
suitable for your needs, and implement that then... 
I expect it to be done by Friday or the following Monday.

Thank you Sebastian I'm not very familiar w/Perl, but I think this solves my problem. 
Anyway this is one more wish for next version of Tidy to include built-in SSI support.

Egor, I too work mostly with SSI's. 
The script that Sebastian Lang is working on is a polished function that will do what you want. 
Until his is ready for prime-time, you can use the attached Perl script. 
I call it "stidy"; it's a fairly crude solution but it's a functional utility that does exactly what you need. 
It basically just runs Tidy on your file, then strips out all document-level tags. 
I've been using it quite successfully for almost a week to clean up my SSI/CGI programs. 
Usage is simple and mimic's Tidy's: stidy inputFile.txt  
outputFile.txt 
Notes: It's only a wrapper, so I didn't bother getting very elaborate with options; (just use -c to specify your Tidy's config file and you can use all your favorite Tidy options). 
As such, I did add two options for xhtml/indentation, respectively, because I personally toggle those two a lot from the command line... 
Just run stidy -h for help/usage. 
Comments in the script are self-explanatory. 
- I don't know if this works under Windows or not. 
I can't see any reason for it not to, but I haven't bothered to trying... Perhaps you can play with/improve it and send feedback to the list, myself and most importantly Sebastian, so he can incorporate any input into his final, program. 
Enjoy! 
(Hey Sebastian: this version has a few minor changes from the one I sent you yesterday.) ~pete 
Egor I'm not very familiar w/Perl, but I think this solves my problem. 
In that case, you'll want to go to: and download the latest version of Perl. 
It's free of course. 
After you install it, make sure things are OK but typing this on commnad-line: perl -v If you get some version output then things are OK. 
I notice from your e-mail header that you are using Windows, so to run the perl scripts we sent you, just open a DOS window and type: c:\ perl stidy inFile.txt  
outFile.txt 
Hope this helps... ~pete
