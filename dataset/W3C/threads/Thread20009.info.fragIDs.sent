Just tried to view the page it is a massive jumble of gibberish if i save the file to local directory (but no images) it is perfectly readable i tried to unselect the download images option to simulate this on line but the on line pages still displayed images and jumble continued ...

Using the version of Amaya that I pulled out of CVS this moring (July 10, 2000), I was able to view this page properly. 
Until a resized Amaya's window a couple of times; it then indeed became jibberish. 
I hit the "reload" button and the page was fixed; but when I resized Amaya's window again, the page was messed up again. 
This page (http://home.netscape.com/browsers/future/gecko.html ) does not seem to have any HTML errors in it. 
At certain times, Amaya seems to want to render the second un-numbered list right on top of the first one. 
As far as I know, there is no way to disable inline images.

Hi, That page also looks like giberish for me in Amaya (3.2 binary for Solaris). 
Saving it locally it's still giberish - the lists are different size fonts and overlapping. 
HTML Tidy ( http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ ) reports 75 warnings on the page. 
The tidied version loads neatly in Amaya. 
Many of the warnings relate to font and /font tags.

John, the page is invalid. 
I guess you know that. 
How do we validate MathML?

After a local save the page was OK and I guess I found the origin of the trouble: due to a lot of elements center and font and perhaps a bug in the parser, Amaya tries to put in lines tables and doesn't generate the right line spacing. 
I'll try to fix the formatter bug and the parser bug as soon as possible. 
Nevertheless this HTML page is invalid. 
Irene.
