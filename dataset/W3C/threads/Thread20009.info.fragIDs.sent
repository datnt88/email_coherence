<s> Just tried to view the page it is a massive jumble of gibberish if i save the file to local directory (but no images) it is perfectly readable i tried to unselect the download images option to simulate this on line but the on line pages still displayed images and jumble continued ... [1] does the selector for download images function [2] what causes jumble on the page ???  </s>

<s> Using the version of Amaya that I pulled out of CVS this moring (July 10, 2000), I was able to view this page properly.  </s>
<s> Until a resized Amaya's window a couple of times; it then indeed became jibberish.  </s>
<s> I hit the "reload" button and the page was fixed; but when I resized Amaya's window again, the page was messed up again.  </s>
<s> This page (http://home.netscape.com/browsers/future/gecko.html ) does not seem to have any HTML errors in it.  </s>
<s> At certain times, Amaya seems to want to render the second un-numbered list right on top of the first one.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, there is no way to disable inline images.  </s>

<s> Hi, That page also looks like giberish for me in Amaya (3.2 binary for Solaris).  </s>
<s> Saving it locally it's still giberish - the lists are different size fonts and overlapping.  </s>
<s> HTML Tidy ( http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ ) reports 75 warnings on the page.  </s>
<s> The tidied version loads neatly in Amaya.  </s>
<s> Many of the warnings relate to font and /font tags.  </s>

<s> John, the page is invalid.  </s>
<s> I guess you know that.  </s>
<s> How do we validate MathML?  </s>
<s> Regards, Jim FitzSimons  </s>
<s> After a local save the page was OK and I guess I found the origin of the trouble: due to a lot of elements center and font and perhaps a bug in the parser, Amaya tries to put in lines tables and doesn't generate the right line spacing.  </s>
<s> I'll try to fix the formatter bug and the parser bug as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless this HTML page is invalid.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
