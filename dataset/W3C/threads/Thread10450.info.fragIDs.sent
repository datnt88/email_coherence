<s> Basically a thumbs-up.  </s>
<s> Mostly typos follow, although I've still some concerns about mentioning the law at all in this document.  </s>
<s> Section 2.2.3 - The last sentence "The other kind of value..." kind of leaves me hanging, wanting to know what a literal is.  </s>
<s> And isn't this section about names, not values?  </s>
<s> Section 3.1 - Is the last sentence a shorthand for "...is the conjunction *of the meaning* of all the statements..."? Actually, that's more confusing, better as it is.  </s>
<s> Section 3.2 - This chestnut again.  </s>
<s> Nodes _are_ URIrefs, but arcs are labelled by URIrefs.  </s>
<s> This is nitpicking though.  </s>
<s> Section 3.3 - Terms like "paired with exactly one" make the lexical- value mapping sound bijective, although both bullet points taken together make this clear.  </s>
<s> - XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> This might actually be a comment on semantics section 4.1, rule rdf2b.  </s>
<s> I wasn't sure when I read that if the canonical form of an XML Literal subsumed the lang tag into the literal or whether it's an external thing.  </s>
<s> If the latter (which section 5 might be seens as giving the lie to) rdf2b needs revision (for a typo).  </s>
<s> - last paragraph.  </s>
<s> Note that compound XML schema types are somewhat undersupported at the moment (I think).  </s>
<s> Section 3.5 - possibly an OWL comment: can OWL express a relational compound primary key using the relational- rdf mapping suggested in this example?  </s>
<s> Section 3.6 - First paragraph, "The ideas *of* meaning..." Section 4.2, penultimate paragraph.  </s>
<s> - Be really bloody careful here.  </s>
<s> Libel law (in the UK at least) does not observe the de re/de dicto distinction; publishing a libellous statement with qualifications or in quotes may constitute libel itself.  </s>
<s> Don't write anything that might be construed as quasi- legal advice into something published by the W3C (or get someone with a legal head to check it first).  </s>
<s> Section 4.5 - be careful here too.  </s>
<s> if the assertion in (B) comes after that in (C), the publishers of (C) might feel hard-done-by should a specification indicate that they are in the wrong (although "previously defined" might be seen as a get-out).  </s>
<s> Section 6.4 - phew!  </s>
<s> It's ironic that "universal resource identifiers" have been extended to produce "international resource identifiers".  </s>
<s> Section 6.5.2 - typo, second paragraph: "the pair *formed* by the lexical form..." Section 7. - first para, I've only ever seen "context-free" hyphenated, although "context dependent" looks fine.  </s>
<s> Maybe someone can step in with a dictionary?  </s>
<s> - third bullet point reads to me as with a use/mention problem.  </s>
<s> I think "Graham Klyne's car" should be in quotes.  </s>
<s> Is Graham Klyne's car an abstract idea?  </s>
<s> Or is the notion of his car the idea?  </s>
<s> In fact, the whole example is borderline Pythonesque.  </s>
<s> - fourth bullet point reads "Thus: thus, ..." I think that's it.  </s>
<s> I would add a disclaimer at the top (probably after the penultimate paragraph of section 1) that (particularly non-normative) sections are intended to be illustrative/expositive/explanatory/whatever and not to constitute any form of legal advice.  </s>

<s> I got a lawyer (Danny W.) to look at the concepts stuff a while back; he was OK with the legal stuff there.  </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure I sent mail to the WG saying so... darn; searching for the keywords I think I would have used (Weitzner, rdfms-assertion) suggests I didn't.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any changes that suggest he should look at it again, though I haven't been following very closely.  </s>
<s> But I'm fairly confident we're OK here.  </s>
<s> EricM, if you're not, please get Danny to review it again after last call.  </s>

<s> To be clear, my concern is not over the legal accuracy of the statements, just that it can't be construed as offering legal advice (the US is notoriously litigious).  </s>
<s> Cheers, jan jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.  </s>

<s> Jan, Thanks for this... it's added to my issues list for action in the last-call period.  </s>
