<s> Charles, The accessible browser project is a group of senior design students that are working on building a more accessible browser.  </s>
<s> The accessible browser is built on Microsoft Internet Explorer technology and supports graphical and speech rendering of web pages.  </s>
<s> It will also support structural navigation and the dynamic application of style sheets.  </s>
<s> The feature of greatest interest to the User Agent working group is a new feature to navigate to elements with event handlers (even if they are not links or form controls), allow the user to query what events are associated with the element and then allow the user to trigger each of the events manually.  </s>
<s> This is very important for showing implementation experience for Checkpoints 1.2, 9.2 and 9.4.  </s>
<s> I hoping they will also be able to implement checkpoint 9.5 on disabling automatic triggering of user interface events.  </s>
<s> More on the overall project at: Jon  </s>
