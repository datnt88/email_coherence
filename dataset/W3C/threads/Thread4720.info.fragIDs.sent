<s> Spaces are required between adjacent keywords such as "treat as".  </s>
<s> This is implicit in the "longest token" rule: if there were no space, there would be a single token "treatas", which would not be recognized by the grammar.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this needs further clarification.  </s>

<s> I can only explain this with general rules, which is that "words" must be separated by requiredSkip, and punctuation can be optionalSkip.  </s>
<s> I will try and make this more explicit in the next draft.  </s>

<s> Scott, Thanks for the clarification.  </s>
<s> The general rules that you stated below ( i.e. - "words" must be separated by requiredSkip, and punctuation can be optionalSkip) seem appropriate and work well in practice.  </s>
<s> The rules even obviate the need for explicit whitespace in productions such as: The other option would be to add S and S? explicitly according to the previously stated rules.  </s>
<s> It would be unambiguous but it would also be messy.  </s>
