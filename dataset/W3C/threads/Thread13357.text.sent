Hi wcag editor, Here's something that came up in an er-ig discussion. 
I've seen a couple of cases where people color table cells to show information. 
See for example discussion at Note this is a real data table, not merely use of table for layout. 
I didn't see a checkpoint that explicitly warned against this. 
For example, "don't use color alone" doesn't really apply if the fill color is black... people don't think of that as using color. 
The workaround for this is to put an image in the cell with alt text. 
The image could be a rectangle filling the cell or some other shape. 
In either case there can be suitable alt text.

This is probably something subtle enough that the WCAG should take note of it. 
Would another acceptable work around be to use an "X" in each marked cell? 
The author could also use black-text-on-black-background to hide the character on compliant GUI browsers.

Will forward to wcag.
