<s> [This was originally sent on April 8 to ietf-charsets@iana.org.  </s>
<s> This alias appears to be nonfunctional again.]  </s>
<s> The enclosed registration of 6 charsets is rejected.  </s>
<s> The reasons are: - The procedure has not been followed.  </s>
<s> There is no procedure for registering more than one character set in a submission form.  </s>
<s> - The registration does not say whether or not the character sets given are usable as "charset" values for use with MIME text/* body parts.  </s>
<s> Note: The charset reviewer finds that the registration author has failed to understand the meaning of this requirement.  </s>
<s> - The registration refers to an internet-draft.  </s>
<s> The internet-draft says (like all internet-drafts) that "It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."  </s>
<s> - The registration refers to a non-published (at the time of writing) specification.  </s>
<s> The registration needs to be updated to reflect the fact that the specification is published; a stable URL to the specification itself would be appreciated, but is not mandatory as long as it can be located using its publication information.  </s>
<s> The character set reviewer will review these registrations again once they are submitted in a proper format and with adequate information.  </s>
<s> NOTE: The reason given for the publication of these character sets before the publication of the I-D is that the author wants the MIBenum numbers assigned so that they can be included in the RFC.  </s>
<s> The traditional means of accomplishing this function is to include the registration template in the text of the I-D, and include an "IANA note" asking that the registration be completed, and MIBenum numbers assigned, before publication of the RFC.  </s>
<s> NOTE: There is nothing in the procedures that prevents a wholly Japanese standard from being referenced as "openly available".  </s>
<s> However, the nature of the referenced standard has made it impossible for the charset reviewer to locate a copy of it, or to check whether the requirements for stability or clearness of CCS/CES references given in RFC 2278 section 3.1 are fulfilled.  </s>
<s> Others may choose to bring challenge on this point in the next round of review.  </s>
<s> The decision of the charset reviewer may be appealed to the IESG under section 4.2 of RFC 2278.  </s>

<s> Harald;  </s>
<s> Given your versatile way of interpreting text, we are glad that we can ignore all the written rules of IETF and your text can be interpreted that you approve the registration of 6 charsets.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much.  </s>

<s> The JSC committee which developed JIS X 0213?  </s>
<s> You, Yasuoka-san, and Shibano-san?  </s>
<s> Apparently, "we" cannot mean all Japanese, because I do not agree.  </s>
<s> I know that many Japanese experts do not agree either.  </s>
