I searched the spec and could not find any special details on handling ETags. 
Should an ETag value be updated when a dead property is changed? 
On the same note, do most servers update the last-modified-date when a dead property is changed? 
Does Webdav want to take a stand one way or another? 
Curious, Kevin Probably, on the basis that an ETag represents the resource, and the properties are part of the resource. 
mod_dav does not update the last-modified-date. 
This is stated at I'd prefer it didn't since it would be rather painful for me to support. 
But that's just me :-) Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/

- Jim Unfortunately, I am pretty sure that Windows 2K will NOT update the eTag when dead properties change (I haven't checked recent versions, but older ones did not). 
Although I agree with Greg: it should. 
I don't know about other WebDAV-enabled servers.
