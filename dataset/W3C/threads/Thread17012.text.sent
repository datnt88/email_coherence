This is kind of hypothetical, but it crossed my mind this morning. 
When you measure something, you stick to one type of unit. 
Be it inches or centimeters. 
You don't mix the two, because it's not logical. 
So why is it that we mix them on the web? 
We set our screen resolution to pixels. 
Yet we have all of these other measurements such as points, ems and percentages that screw things up. 
We're mixing measurements, which you don't do in any other line of work. 
Personally, it would be great if we could say our monitor was to appear in ems, rather than pixels, but that's not how it works. 
What I'm getting at is wouldn't it be better if browsers just used pixel measurements? 
Instead of IE giving keyword choices, what if it gave you the choice of pixel sizes such as 800x600, which could then resize everything inside of the browser window? 
This is how Opera works, right? 
Seems to me this would eliminate a lot of confusion for developers, and make users happy too. 
I should note that I have not read the User Agent Accessiblity Guidelines. 
Randal Rust Covansys, Inc. Columbus, OH Yep, agree to a point, but mixing percentages and pixles should be fine. 
I say this because when I was training to be a baker (a long time ago when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do) we used to create recipes in percentages as this gave the opportunity to work in grammes or pounds and ounces. 
Does it not work like that for pixels as well? 
I would agree that mixing elements such as pixles and ems could cause problems, but percentages should actually help. 
Just a thought... Kind regards Simon This is kind of hypothetical, but it crossed my mind this morning.

Randal Rust Covansys, Inc. Columbus, OH VirusChecked by the Incepta Group plc We set screen resolution in pixels. 
because pixels relate to the physical properties of our hardware. 
We also need to specify the number of pixels per inch. 
That way we can set the physical resolution to work well with the hardware, but set the logical resolution to something that works well with our eyes. 
Setting measurements in pixels ignores the second step. 
Sometimes you can olny specify in pixels though (when dealing with rasterized graphics, for example). 
The question "How does this site look at 800 by 600" is actually meaningless. 
You need to specify the pixels per inch as well.
