I am using a local style sheet that is in fact an HTML document. 
When I open it in amaya it is opened as a text document, becuase it was saved as amaya.css 
Can I change this, so I can save it as something.html?

Why are you using a HTML file? 
Irene. 
OK, I should look for that bit, because it would be useful to be able to set my local style sheet as a preference. 
I am using an HTML file because then I can make the style shet my home page, and I can do styling by example to change defaults, instead of having to write CSS. 
(There is still no way to save the style sheet from an HTML document either into an existing stylesheet, or into a new one, so this is the only way around that).
