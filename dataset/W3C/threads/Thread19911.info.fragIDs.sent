<s> Help! I've tried installing various binary distributions of Amaya on RH6.0  </s>
<s> Linux - latest is the rpm of 2.4.1.  </s>
<s> Amaya loads and displays the first page, but then disappears if I follow an external link, claiming a broken pipe.  </s>
<s> It sometimes loads part of the external page, but it always bombs out.  </s>
<s> I'm using an MS proxyserver, but it seems to be OK, in that it asks for authentication OK and supplies some of the page data at least.  </s>
<s> I assume I've set something up incorrectly, but any pointers would be gratefully received.  </s>
<s> I've been through the list archives, and have found a couple of similar queries, but no answers :-) Thanks, Stuart White  </s>
<s> Hello Stuart, In our previous episode, Stuart White said:  </s>
<s> Amaya uses the HTTP/1.1 protocol.  </s>
<s> It may be that the proxy isn't fully compliant.  </s>
<s> I've used the proxy function against an Apache server and it worked well for me.  </s>
<s> One way that we can test it is if you telnet to your proxy and type: HEAD http://www.w3.org/ HTTP/1.1 Host:www.w3.org Connection: Keep-Alive Then see what it returns.  </s>
<s> It should return something close to: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2000 11:24:05 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) PHP/3.0.11 Last-Modified: Mon, 03 Jan 2000 17:16:36 GMT ETag: "2c0540-3313-3870d974" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 13075 Keep-Alive: timeout=15 Connection: Keep-Alive  </s>
<s> and it shouldn't break the connection.  </s>
<s> For the other broken pipe problems, I'm working on an upgrade/patch of libwww to try improve the situation.  </s>
<s> In some places, no check is done to see if a socket has been closed, before writing to it.  </s>
<s> This generates many of the broken pipe messages.  </s>
<s> Could you report back to the list?  </s>
<s> Also, if you could use another proxy, could you tell us if you still have the same problems?  </s>
<s> Thanks, -Jose  </s>
<s> NB This is a shouldn't, not a mustn't.  </s>
<s> It may close the connection, although it would then need to respond with Connection: close or HTTP/1.0 headers.  </s>
<s> Dave, thanks for the clarification.  </s>
<s> I couldn't articulate my thoughts clearly.  </s>
<s> I meant to say that the protocol implementation may be broken and it may be saying it's HTTP/1.1 or keeping the connection open and actually doing something else.  </s>
