I need help with the example for Checkpoint 6.1, or a better example. 
The example I was going to use is at The concept I am trying to get across is that with style sheets, even if you "position" elements "randomly" on a page, the content in the HTML file can be arranged logically, even though style is used to display it otherwise. 
My problem is that I have never had success using the limited positioning features of CSS1 as it is implemented in IE4 or Netscape 4. Can anybody come up with a fix for my example, or just create a better example?

I think you could start from and write an example where one has a reading order with CSS on that's different than the one with no CSS (using big negative margin) Alternatively, you could use float and width to have 2 div appears in reverse left/right order. 
Thanks Daniel... I will give it a try.
