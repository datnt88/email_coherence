I see mbox: and rgb: in Are those new URI schemes? 
If so, please register them. 
For details, see the registry... and guidelines... and some notes I keep... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Sadly, many projects are following WebDAV's example of defining a special URI scheme just for the purpose of identiying their namespaces. 
In the case of WebDAV (RFC2518), the scheme was at least registered, and the official errata document recognizes this as a valid issue with the protocol. 
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org) 
sadly is doing the same thing -- it defines a new URI scheme ("svn:") for internal identifiers which now shows up as XML namespace both in internal files (entries files for instance) and in external marshalling (WebDAV request/response bodies). 
It would be nice if this would be fixed before they reach 1.0. 
The issue has certainly been raised but was rejected by their respective developers. 
Julian I fully agree with Julian. 
I just have seen some other such examples in the jabber protocol at the IETF BOF, and have pointed this out as a mistake. 
I propose that we add something like this to the XML guidelines (http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hollenbeck-ietf-xml-guidelines-05. 
txt), just before 4.8.1: "Although there are some examples where this has been done in the past, specifications MUST NOT create new URI schemes to define namespaces."
