Hello, Please note that when I published a link to the Draft reformulation of the guidelines last week that I published the address to an older version. 
The latest version is dated 26 july 2000 and is available at: Thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa I love the first three and hope they are discussed at the Bristol Workshop on Designing for Device Independence. 
I think the fourth is too vague and the sixth doesn't rise to the level of a "principle". 
Not sure what to say about the fifth one. 
I feel it's implicit in the others, but... Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I hate to harp on it, but it still bugs me to have to shift terminology in an arbitrary way. 
And the checkpoints sound like they will be techniques, not checkpoints. 
I am not sure that Xforms makes a lot of difference to the interactivity section - it presumably provides fgood ways to meet the requirements, but is not the only possible technology (it is already feasible to build forms using XML - some SVG and DOM stuff, for example, although that would be a crufde way of doing it). 
I would like to write about device-independent interaction methods - or at least drag together the stuff I have written in several fora over the last couple of years.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Section 3 should be split into 2 and 4. 3.2 - validate to formal grammars - is about using markup correctly (not the same as using it according to specification , becuase it is possible to be syntactically valid with doing what the specification says) 3.1 - - provide appropriate defulat presentations - is about producing content for ease of comprehension. 
For the same reason, the old 2.2 (currently homeless) belongs in 4. And 4.8 - supplement text with graphics and audio, should just be "use graphics and audio where it will facilitate comprehension", and should be in 1, where it will be clear that those on their own will not suffice.
