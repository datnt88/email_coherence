<s> Title: WebDAV PROPFIND Extension To List Specified Namespaces Author(s): J. Stracke Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-propfind-space-00.txt  </s>
<s> Pages: 6 Date: 16-Sep-99 This document specifies an extension to the [WEBDAV] PROPFIND method to permit a WebDAV client to request all properties which belong to a specified namespace or namespaces.  </s>
<s> A URL for this Internet-Draft is: Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP.  </s>
<s> Login with the username "anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  </s>
<s> After logging in, type "cd internet-drafts" and then "get draft-ietf-webdav-propfind-space-00.txt".  </s>
<s> A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.  </s>
<s> Send a message to: mailserv@ietf.org.  </s>
<s> In the body type: "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-propfind-space-00.txt".  </s>
<s> NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  </s>
<s> To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command.  </s>
<s> To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader.  </s>
<s> Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages.  </s>
<s> Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.  </s>
<s> This is quite cool, and mod_dav could easily support something like this.  </s>
<s> Just a few comments: * rather than specifying the uri as an XML attribute, shouldn't it be part of the elem contents?  </s>
<s> [I think I saw an argument somehwere (by Yaron?) that stated is was "best form" to avoid attributes that are specifiers, rather than modifiers]  </s>
<s> * do you want to explicitly state that DAV:namespaces can only appear as a child of DAV:allprop and DAV:propname ?  </s>
<s> * your sample request in 5.2 has the propname/propfind end-elements swapped.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> Mmm...yes, OK, that makes sense.  </s>
<s> Do you think DAV:namespace should contain the URI directly, or contain DAV:href ?  </s>
<s> The former reduces bandwidth &amp; complexity by a tiny amount; the latter leverages the existing definitions better.  </s>
<s> Yes, that makes sense.  </s>
<s> Here's my new text: Purpose: The namespaces XML element introduces a set of namespace elements (below).  </s>
<s> namespaces appears inside allprop or propname , and specifies that the PROPFIND request applies only to properties belonging to the namespaces listed in the enclosed namespace elements.  </s>
<s> Whoops, so it does.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>

<s> The namespace is a URI.  </s>
<s> I believe an href is typically a URL (certainly "href" connotes this meaning).  </s>
<s> So... I would recommend that it just directly contains the URI rather than yet-another-element.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> dig, dig ...the DAV spec says "URI".  </s>
<s> This was the way I was leaning, too.  </s>
<s> The main question that made me wonder was, suppose someone wants to define a type of namespace that's defined by something other than a URI?  </s>
<s> (In such a case, it might be best to be able to swap out the href element for something else.) However, I think the answer is that they should just define a new URI scheme.  </s>
