<s> Dave Reynolds was asking me about the relationship between plain literals and xsd:string, i.e is a plain literal without a lang tag (modulo some funny characters) an xsd:string.  </s>
<s> I adopted the policy of referring him to the spec and indeed he came back and said "found it, its in the bit about entailment rules."  </s>
<s> "Bu**er", I said, that section is now informative!  </s>
<s> I just wanted to check whether we have a normative statement in the specs that _:a eg:prop "aaa" .  </s>
<s> xsd:string entails _:a eg:prop "aaa"^^xsd:string .  </s>
<s> for suitable values of "aaa".  </s>
<s> I should check this myself, but I'm burned this morning and don't want to forget ... Anyone know?  </s>
<s> Does it matter?  </s>
<s> Is there anything else we might have lost by making that section informative?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I think it's not entirely up to us to make this statement normatively, as it depends upon the definition of xsd:string which is not in our remit.  </s>
<s> There was also a small matter (I think) that some valid plain literals were not valid xsd:string, or vice versa, which would kill the entailment as simply stated (or is that now behind us with the NFC revision?) -- as hinted at by 'for suitable values of "aaa"'.  </s>
<s> I suggest the entailment should follow logically from, rather than be asserted by, our specification together with the xsd specification, which I think it does.  </s>
<s> And maybe reinforced by a suitable test case.  </s>
