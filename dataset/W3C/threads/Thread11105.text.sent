While I could support this proposal, please bear with me while I make some observations: From: Peter Flynn[SMTP:pflynn@curia.ucc.ie] 
Sent: Saturday, March 29, 1997 19:47 Subject: Re: The furore over PUBLIC Is it too much to propose that an identifier must be either SYSTEM "url" or PUBLIC "fpi" "url" I gather from draft 961114 that the behaviour of an XML system regarding malformed or unresolvable URLs is not specified ... so I figure it is up to the implementation. 
Production [70] allows the following to be specified in production [69]: SYSTEM "" So what does a conforming XML processor do when it sees this empty string as the ExternalID's SystemLiteral? 
The way I will encode my documents in accordance with the above proposal is to use: PUBLIC "-//my public id//EN" "" Which I am willing to accept will only be resolvable by XML processors supporting resolution ... it is my choice to encode my document this way. 
Is it really so much to ask that I be allowed to use the following instead? 
PUBLIC "-//my public id//EN" ................. Ken That is just a relative URL to the document base URL. 
So its meaning is well defined. 
If you put a really bogus system identifier in, then you have an incorrect XML document, which is probably what you want in practice, but at least the XML spec does not "condone" such a thing. 
I think that if we don't have catalogs then system identifiers should be required, and I would be surprised if the anti-Catalog team would allow public identifiers in otherwise.

Is this a check of well-formedness?

If an XML document is defined to be a document with URLs in particular places things that do not have URLs in those places are just not XML documents. 
That means that they are neither well-formed nor valid XML documents.
