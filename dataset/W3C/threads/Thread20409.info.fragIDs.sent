<s> I downloaded 6.1 a couple of days ago and am just getting to grips with it, however when I select View Source from the menu bar the new window contains an advertisement for Contempt.Productions superimposed on my code, and when I close the window it transfers to the main editing window.  </s>
<s> Can anyone advise what's going on?  </s>

<s> Hello Patrick, This behaviour is very surprising because Amaya doesn't interpret any script language.  </s>
<s> I suppose you downloaded a Windows version.  </s>
<s> Could you use an antivirus and try again.  </s>
<s> Thank you Laurent Carcone Amaya Team  </s>
<s> I use Sophos anti-virus and it is up to date as of today.  </s>
<s> It doesn't report any viruses.  </s>

<s> I have now checked my PC with AdAware and removed any suspect files, but I still get the Contempt advert stuff in my source editor - see attached JPG.  </s>
