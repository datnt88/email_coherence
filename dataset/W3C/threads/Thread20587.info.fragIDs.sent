Just tried using the 6.3 version of Amaya (static libraries) on Linux. 
Amaya crashes when I open the drop down menu Style and select Format. 
Other options, Charactor, Color, Background seem to work just fine.

Hello Anthony, I have downloaded this version of Amaya but I can't reproduce the crash. 
Does it happen systematically or, if not, have you a precise scenario to reproduce it ? 
Otherwise, could you execute Amaya under gdb and send me the trace when it crashes ? 
Thanks, Laurent 
Hello Anthony, 
You tried the Motif version (static library) of Amaya on Linux, right ?

Hum, Amaya loads a specific font to display that Format selector. 
That could be the cause of the crash. 
Could you execute in a xterm "xset fp" then "xset q" to see what font paths are available before the operation and another "xset q" after the operation. 
Irene.
