<s> Trying to edit: x e(=CM)=- y When the fraction button on the Maths palette is selected, the "(" turns into a large "!" and the ")" into a large "#".  </s>

<s> A similar effect has been observed when an integral character gets converted into a large "!" character.  </s>
<s> Another bug in conjunction with this is that the parenthesis (or the corrupt characters) get enlarged out of proportion (to the same size as the following fraction).  </s>

<s> Lars, I guess the problem of displaying "!" or "#" instead of "(" and ")" is a font issue.  </s>
<s> For these large characters, Amaya uses the Stix fonts, and they may be missing in your system.  </s>
<s> I suppose Irene will have a look at this issue.  </s>
<s> Regarding the size of these characters, the problem is the structure of your expression.  </s>
<s> If you replace by you get the size you expect.  </s>
<s> For more details, look at the MathML 2.0 specification, namely sections 3.2.5.8.2 and 7.1.2.  </s>
<s> In Amaya, to generate the appropriate structure, use the parentheses button from the Math palette or type Ctrl+m Ctrl+p, for entering the parentheses around "=CM".  </s>

<s> There are two problems: 1) As there is no enclosing mrow around the first part of the expression the "(" and ")" turn into large symbols.  </s>
<s> 2) Amaya doesn't find the right font (normally a Stix font) to display these large symbols.  </s>
