<s> Just thinking about it again, Friday afternoon in the US is saturday morning here - a time when I prefer not to be at work too early.  </s>
<s> So thursday would be my preference.  </s>
<s> Gregg, if you can send me a phone number I might try calling it to get the times right - we have just gone into daylight savings - forward 1 hour.  </s>
<s> As I understand it you have gone back one hour.  </s>
<s> We were calling at 6 am to make 4pm Boston time (I think) so we should now be calling at 8am to make the same time.  </s>
<s> Anyone else get the same answer??  </s>
