In "reading, writing and 'rithmetic," 'reading' clearly refers to decoding the results of writing. 
But this is a caricature of curriculum, not a definition of the English verb "to read." 
In colloquial English in general, we talk of reading palms or reading the tea leaves. 
Many forms of interpreting experience are included, not just decoding textually-recorded language. 
anyone have a dictionary handy? 
We all have a dictionary handy. 
Quote: 1 a (1) : to receive or take in the sense of (as letters or symbols) especially by sight or touch (2) : to study the movements of (as lips) with mental formulation of the communication expressed ... Found at: In the full dictionary entry there are many examples of qualitative interpretation being termed 'reading.' 
I stopped the quote at "reading lips" because the general meaning stated to cover this example seems to include animations just fine. 
In fact, we talk of instruments taking a reading. 
What is interpreted in reading can be direct experience. 
It need not be an utterance, reflecting another's prior interpretation. 
What does a radiologist do with the analog, film-image X-rays? 
Al this was somewhat my point but when reading media, we usually refer to it as assimilation of text? 
To put it another way, how can an animation be read aloud? 
you can describe it outloud, but that is not the same as a one to one correspondence as with text. 
I do not miss the point here though that strides towards higher comprehention and interaction are being made.

I know you understand, and I count on it. 
This is what in the literature on leadership is termed 'vision' -- the ability to think in terms of what is possible but not obvious. 
Please pardon the pedantry of my next [following] blast. 
It could have been summed up in terms of thinking of the scenario of reading a children's book to a young child. 
The person reading the book ususally both voices the text and talks about the pictures. 
But at a summary level, at the level of aggregation of the whole book, we still refer to this as "reading the book." 
Al be read aloud? 
Ah, but you seem to be including "aloud" in the phrase above. 
There's no guarantee that "reading" can be directly translated into "aloud" in English usage -- "reading" is an input action, and "aloud" is an output action, so "reading aloud" is a composite action. 
An animated gif can be -read-. 
Reading it -aloud- is a different matter and depends more on the ability to vocalize than it does on the ability to read.

I saw the dictionary definition and if I told someone I read a photo, I'd be laughed at.

this becomes more interesting but I ave never heard of reading an xray. 
analizing perhaps or looking at but not reading. 
I know of the fuzziness of this however and accept it but we must become more clear lest we be mired down in what we read whatever that means.

AG:: On the other hand, if you told someone your radiologist read your X-Rays, they would not blink. 
If you described it any other way they would find it odd. 
It is a matter of context whether text input is assumed when "reading" is the activity. 
There is no one boundary to the meaning of a term in natural language. 
Natural language terms zoom in and out in definition space as a function of the context in which they are used. 
Al I've "read" comic books that don't have any dialogue. 
I think you may not be giving enough credit to the term "read."

Thus spake Kynn Bartlett on 00.9.4 2:13 AM at kynn-edapta@idyllmtn.com: Don't read anything into this, but... ...read between the lines; read my lips; they didn't read the defense; am I reading this situation right? 
Read the handwriting on the wall: you can read tea leaves or palms, but you sure better read your clients! 
How do I know? 
Because I'm a mind reader!
