<s> I am currently writing an application using HTTP/1.1 protocol to send a file to a HTTP server via the HTTP PUT request.  </s>
<s> I know that there is a general-header item "connection" that could be used with the value "close" to notify that the client wants to close the connection after the request.  </s>
<s> My problem is that if the server returns a 401 response ( or the proxy a 407 response) I don't want the connection to be closed before I anthenticate to it.  </s>
<s> So I have decided not to include the connection header item before my job is finished and I would like to know what kind of request I could send to the server with the "connection: close" item.  </s>

<s> you can just close the connection when you're done with it.  </s>
<s> Persistent connections don't obligate you to send more transactions, they simply allow you to do so.  </s>
<s> side note: the server could always issue a connection close in its response, or decide to close the connection in between transactions just like your client can select to do the same thing.  </s>
<s> Beware of the race conditions inherent in this latter condition if you are reusing the connection.  </s>
<s> I have some problems with implementing Digest Authentication for a small web-server.  </s>
<s> I do not know how many browsers support Digest Authentication.  </s>

<s> The way I do it is to store the local 'nonce counter' in a session object and increment the value every time I get a request.  </s>
<s> I keep 3  </s>

<s> This is to prevent 'nonce' mismatch if the client  </s>

<s> I simply search for the correct {nonce, nc} pair by comparing the local nonce with the client nonce.  </s>
<s> I then increment the  </s>
<s> 'nc' value for the {nonce, nc} pair that matches the client nonce.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the client sometimes skips a 'nc' value.  </s>
<s> For example, the server and client nonce count matches say to the value  </s>
<s> 00000016, but then the next value from the client is 00000018?  </s>

<s> Squid implements digest authentication, although I don't know how many sites really use it.  </s>

<s> As far as I understand, the bigger the bit mask, the greater risk you run of having a reply attack slip through your protection mechanism.  </s>
<s> I run a few tests using various browsers and the only browser implementing preemptive authorization seems to be Opera.  </s>
