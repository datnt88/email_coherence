<s> Suits me fine  </s>

<s> Some of us are around most days (though #validator and #rdfig are usually a lot more active than #er).  </s>

<s> I can't make 6pm (but could on the phone maybe, if you don't mind london traffic background noice as I cycle...) 4pm is no problem, or indeed any other earlier time, later is a maybe...  </s>
<s> Any day before 6pm London is easy, normally tuesdays and thursdays at 6pm, but not this week as I have engagements.  </s>
<s> after the pubs close UK is also feasible, but it depends how "in-training" I stay and avoid too much beer.  </s>
