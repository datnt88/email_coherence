<s> I suggest double-A, like UAAG." My comment: At first, this seemed very appropriate.  </s>
<s> However, I am thinking about that single-A WCAG 1.0 might be appropriate.  </s>
<s> I suppose that since WCAG measures accessibility in units of "pages" (among other units) so that the whole page would need to conform.  </s>
<s> I guess that I would dislike restricting the publishing of claims only to sites that rated double-A and higher.  </s>

<s> CMN Yes.  </s>
<s> JRG Is there anything in XML like the Head block that contains META information?  </s>
<s> CMN XML is a language for writing languages in.  </s>
<s> XML doesn't itself define a HEAD element.  </s>
<s> But many languages writtenn in XML (e.g. XHTML - which is almost exactly the same as HTML 4.0, SVG) do have such an element, or at least a paralell mechanism.  </s>
<s> XML that includes the use of the namespaces specification allows multiple kinds of XML to be mixed together, and one of the commonest uses of this in existing implementation is for RDF metadata.  </s>

<s> HB: Much web content is now generated by database extraction.  </s>

<s> Some content, such as images, from database may fail accessibility checks.  </s>
<s> These may come from diverse sources without the expected alternative descriptions included.  </s>
<s> HB: XML is a language for describing applications.  </s>
<s> It has nothing inherent that helps or hinders accessibility or inclusion or omission of metainformation.  </s>
<s> An XML application needs to be evaluated for its provision of accessibility information.  </s>
<s> The variety possible among XML applications means that any guidelines we produce for user agents may be at best of general interest to the designers of those applications.  </s>
<s> HB: We have been silent about the new XML application designer including what is in the head section of HTML or XHTML to contain any metainformation.  </s>
<s> HB: HTML or XML !--comments -- have no syntactic meaning.  </s>
<s> The meta element type is repeatable within the head section of HTML or XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> Interspersed between element types can be comments.  </s>
<s> HB: Note that most any attribute="value" pair in any starttag of a document tagged to any application of XML is metainformation about that element type in which it occur.  </s>
<s> HB: XML applications can contain but certainly needn't have analogs of the HTML META information.  </s>
<s> In some cases, such as Dublin Core, the 15 kinds of metadata each have element types so named.  </s>
<s> Including Dublin Core within HTML uses the repeated META element with attribute pairs: where the values for name are the 15 kinds of Dublin Core.  </s>
