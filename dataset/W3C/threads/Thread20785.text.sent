Request for enhancement: Ability to create rowspans and colspans graphically. 
The ability in Amaya to create and edit tables graphically is an important and powerful feature. 
AFAIK, it's the only open-source HTML editor that provides this capability. 
It'd be even grander if Amaya enabled you to graphically create rowspans and colspans. 
For example, you'd highlight a cell, choose a menu command like "Span [or Merge] Cell to left|right|above|below" or "Split Cell into rows|columns", and Amaya would generate the rowspan and colspan attributes and re-render the table. 
(Tak Ota's table.el[1]-- 
an ASCII table editor for Emacs -- lets you create spans that way, and then generate HTML, CALS, TEI, and Latex source.) 
Or you'd highlight two cells and then choose a menu command like "Span [or Merge] Cells" to merge the two cells into one. 
I'm not too familiar with current commercial HTML editing tools, but epcEdit, XMetaL, and Arbortext Epic are three XML editors I know that provide the ability to graphically edit tables. 
(I think Morphon may have added some table capabilities in its latest beta release, but I haven't tried the new version yet, so don't know.) So it'd be great to have a similar feature in Amaya.

This would be a good thing to do, and would be an obvious case for using transformations, although I don't think that it can be implemented in the T language easily. 
Would it be possible to add an API to an XSLT processor, and write the transformation as an XSLT (this would be a good thing to do in general)? 
An alternative approach would be to select a few cells in a row or in a column, and then merge them explicitly. 
The big requirement would be a way of selecting a column of table cells, which requires a different selection mechanism (a visual method rather than a "logical" method based on the underlying structure). 
Whether that should be done via a toggle, like browse/edit mode, or should be a different selection method (shift-alt-arrow, or right-mouse-drag...) is an open question that I think is interesting. 
I think it would be a mistake to force selection of table items to be visual instead of structural - this would go against the existing interface conventions of amaya. 
But imlementing this visual mode only for tables at first would seem ok.

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hi Michael, Thanks for your suggestion. 
We'll work on that as soon as possible, but unfortunately it won't be available in the next release planned by end of the year. 
Mozilla Composer is also capable of doing this, and the code for Mozilla is licensed under the MPL, the GPL, or the LGPL (depending upon component). 
The MPL is an OSI-approved license, as obviously are the GPL and LGPL. 
So, no, Amaya isn't the only editor with this capability. 
It is, however, the Open Source editor with the best approach to editing overall (the browser/editor approach).

[There may yet be some small amount of code in Mozilla under the Netscape Public License, which is not, I believe, an OSI approved license, though it could be described as "open source"; but I doubt there is any non-open code in Mozilla Composer.] 
Hi Mike, yes, XSLT might be a bit of overkill for this case, but it would be nice in geenral to have an XSLT transformation engine, and it would do this job fine. 
(I don't really care how the function is implemented of course). 
Actually tables are more than just a layout convention, they specifiy some kinds of 2-dimensional relationships between data - which is more powerful than general XML tree structure, and less powerful than full RDF graphs. 
It turns out that there is a lot of such data around, so it is a useful construct to have, but as you say it does mean rethinking some conventions to get the interface right. 
Cheers Charles Hm, using XSLT to handle it kinda seems like it might be overkill to me. 
I have not idea how the similar functionality is handled in other apps, but I'm sure it's not with XSLT. 
Yeah, tables are always sort of an exception. 
Even in a DTD like DocBook that by design does not include any other presentational markup, you've got to have markup for tables, which is really just saying how the content should be presented/formatted/arranged visually-- in an paricular arrangement of an explicit number of columns and rows and spans, which can't vary no matter what output format (PDF, HTML, whatever) the content ends up being delivered in.
