The mouse pointer could change when over a link. 
this would give some visible indication for those documents whose stylesheets declare the colour of links to be the foreground colour. 
[DJW:] My understanding is that Amaya is primarily an editor, not a browser; as such I don't think it should make it too easy to mis-design pages in this way. 
If the design is really that bad that you can't guess the links, the authors deserve not to get your business, but you can still find the links in the structure view. 
(Voting with ones feet has become rather topical in UK politics!) Overriding of style sheets/colours It would be nice to be able to override things that another site has set, so I can change the colours etc. 
The Style menu is disabled when not editing. 
[DJW:] I don't know whether there is already support for this, but I believe it is a presumption of CSS that the browser should, conceptually, have a user style sheet associated with it, and that !important rules can be used to override the document style sheet. 
I say conceptually, as the style sheet might only be accessible by menus, not by loading a CSS document.

Agreed, but I don't think this would break anything. 
Also agreed: this should be dicouraged in pages Amaya creates, but sometimes people browse other's pages with it. 
This feature would also be useful on images which are links, of course. 
Shame to miss out on an otherwise excellent site though. 
Netscape used my colour settings so I didn't have thit problem till using Amaya as a browser for the site. 
It picked up the style sheet from there, I suppose, which "broke" this for me.

I could not find it, but have not explored CSS really, yet. 
Not sure if rules will cover my cases: Eg intelligent selection of contrasting colours is non-trivial when one has to juggle unvisited links, visited links, background colour, foreground text colour and (possibly partially transparent) images, and get them all to "agree".

The first place to check is in the profiles, to make sure the style stuff is still available in browser mode. 
I don't know if it is that simple, but that would be nice - then you can change it by adjusting the profile stuff in your local directory, rather than having to get a new version. 
I don't know if !important is implemented yet (but it belongs high on the wish list - it is !important for accessibility, and would be useful particularly in view of the Windows habit of amking fonts very large compared to toher systems, so that websitye designers set them small enough to be illegible). 
Sadly, I know nothing at all about the code for CSS in Amaya.

2. Support English (as well as American). 
3. Save as ASCII. 
I'm using Amaya in New Zealand. 
We have two official languages here, English and M&amp;amacr;ori. 
M&amp;amacr;ori is written in the Latin alphabet, using the same punctuation marks as English, BUT vowel length is an important part of spelling. 
Current practice is to misuse ISO Latin 1, and use vowels with umlauts instead of vowels with macrons. 
This looks very wrong, so current practice is also to install bodged fonts so that the vowels with umlauts are displayed as vowels with macrons. 
Trouble with that is that the texts look really stupid everywhere else on the planet. 
HTML 4 and XML are based on ISO 10646. 
Would it be so very much to ask that Amaya should support the Latin Extended A area of ISO 10646 (characters u+0100 to u+017f)? 
There is a Unicode font available for the X Window System, and I reckon fixed width letters with the right accent would be better than proportionally spaced letters with the wrong accent. 
It would also be extremely nice to have an English version of Amaya. 
Currently there is an American version, but it's really rather irritating. 
I'd be happy to provide English versions of the relevant files if someone will tell me which ones I can safely edit and how to persuade Amaya to use them. 
It's rather more of a nuisance coping with having an American dictionary instead of an English one. 
I might have a go at that, but I don't know what the format is. 
Finally, I like to process HTML pages with a variety of tools, and in particular, I provide them on Macintoshes. 
For that reason, it is important that my HTML editor *NOT* convert &amp;aelig; and other character entities to ISO Latin 1 bytes in the output. 
It would be really useful if there were an option in the Save/Save As diaglogue to select between ASCII and Latin-1 (and maybe some day UTF-8?) output, ideally with a Preference to configure the default. 
Here I am not asking that Amaya _remember_ whether character entities were used or not, only that when it saves a file, it be able to _generate_ a character entity whenever there's something outside the ASCII range. 
Only to say that I strongly support this request of Richard.
