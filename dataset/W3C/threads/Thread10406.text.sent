Looking at the QA matrix I note the following aspects concerning the RDF PR documents 1) RDF Schema does not have conformance clauses 2) The test suite covers aspects of RDF Syntax, RDF Semantics, RDF Schema and RDF Concepts (although it is not a conformance test suite for any of these) 3) there is an RDF validator hosted at www.w3.org/RDF/Validator that checks syntax against RDF Syntax, and also some constraints from the abstract syntax, in RDF Concepts Jeremy PS for OWL there is more than one validator, none of which are hosted at the W3C - typically they validate the syntax only Le mer 17/12/2003 ?

: The QA Matrix doesn't claim that it does. 
Or did I misunderstand what you meant? 
OK, I've added Test Suites entries for these various specs. 
The RDF Validator is now bound to both of these specs. 
Could you send us the URLs of these services, so that we can link to them from the matrix? 
Thanks for the updates, Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM Sorry I was misreading the validator link ... the link seems to be broken, and as far as I am aware VRP has not been updated to conform to the latest RDF Schema PR. (i.e. afaik it still harks back to the old CR from 2000). 
Looking at I would suggest as a good online service.
