<s> To Dave Raggett care of html-tidy@w3.org  </s>
<s> Good morning, I have a problem with CSS and MicroSoft Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> If my html file (xxxxx.htm)  </s>
<s> is: and my "style.css"  </s>
<s> is: body { background: #00cc00; color: #000000; table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background: #ffddff; MSIE (vers.  </s>
<s> 6.0), Netscape (vers.  </s>
<s> 6.2) and Opera (vers.  </s>
<s> 6.0) understand that perfectly and give me a "rose table" in the center of a green page.  </s>
<s> Then I test my html file with Tidy.  </s>
<s> Result:  </s>
<s> Tidy (vers 30th April 2000) Parsing "xxxxx.htm"  </s>
<s> "xxxxx.htm"  </s>
<s> appears to be HTML 4.01 Transitional no warnings or errors were found As a result, I follow the advice of TIDY and I change the text of the line #1 of my html file to this one :  </s>
<s> Now MS Internet Explorer (vers 6.0) doesn't understand the code: "margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" any more, and my rose table goes to the left side of the screen!...  </s>
<s> Note: I haven't this problem with Netscape 6.2 or Opera 6.0.  </s>
<s> How do you understand this phenomenon?  </s>
<s> What's the remedy?  </s>
<s> What must I do?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> Yours Sincerely.  </s>

<s> It's a goofy idea called "Doctype Sniffing", invented and implemented by Netscape/Mozilla (for NS6 and the Mozilla builds) and dutifully copied by Microsoft for IE 6.0.  </s>
<s> The idea is this: if the user has *no* DOCTYPE, or HTML 4.x Transitional, or an earlier "official" one, then give them the old CSS-with-bugs.  </s>
<s> If they request HTML 4.x Strict or an "unknown" one, give them the "new" and "bug-free" CSS.  </s>
<s> The reason they did this was that if they all of a sudden replaced the CSS engines, people would complain that their pages all of a sudden looked terrible in the new bug-reduced version.  </s>
<s> :) So they needed a "switch", something to say "turn on/off correct CSS".  </s>
<s> In possibly a glue-sniffing-induced moment of brilliance they decided to use the DOCTYPE declaration as this "switch".  </s>
<s> (In your case, IE5.x and earlier didn't understand the CSS "auto" for margins.) Several things wrong with this idea, IMO: 1) What has CSS got to do a document's data structure (as defined by the DTD)?  </s>
<s> 2) IE6's "good" CSS is still very buggy!  </s>
<s> So what are they going to use as a "switch" for IE7 or 8 or whenever they finally get it right?  </s>
<s> :) Any your choices would appear to be: A) Use the Transitional DTD and be stuck with buggy CSS.  </s>
<s> B) Change the DOCTYPE to reference your own custom DTD.  </s>
<s> Note in this case you could actually -- if validation is something you use -- copy the HTML 4.0 Transitional DTD to your own location and reference it under a different name.  </s>
<s> In that case you'd be still really using the Transitional DTD for markup purposes, but you'd be "fooling" the Doctype Sniffer and thus allowing you to use good CSS.  </s>
<s> And if you don't give a hoot about markup validation, you could actually just change the Doctype declaration to read something like: and the CSS you gave in your example will work correctly -- try it!  </s>
<s> So much for the brilliance of Doctype Sniffing... :) C) Change the DOCTYPE to reference the Strict DTD.  </s>
<s> (See below)  </s>
<s> Tidy is not really "testing" your markup (for that, you'd use a validator[1]).  </s>
<s> It's "Tidying" it -- making an attempt at cleaning up markup errors and then "pretty-printing" the result.  </s>
<s> Take Tidy's guess of what the file was to begin with with a grain of salt -- it's not advice as to what it *should* be.  </s>
<s> The DTD *you* want your document to conform to is what is important.  </s>
<s> Since you're using CSS anyway, and thus don't need the presentational markup of the Transitional DTD, I would suggest you use the Strict DTD (avoid center , font , etc.).  </s>
<s> If so, change your Doctype declaration to read: Then you can have clean markup *and* use (relatively :) good CSS. [1] http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> MSIE 6 uses doctype switching, if a well-known doctype is presented the browser renders the page following that standard, otherwise it tries a "best guess" method.  </s>
<s> Since your original doctype declaration refers to a non-standard doctype, MSIE used proprietary attributes, with the standard doctype, rendering reverts to standards compliant.  </s>
