I pulled this from wai-ig to discuss here in more detail. 
It regards designing pages to reduce need to do horizontal scrolling. 
Potential thing to check for in ERT. 
I'd suggest a placeholder. 
In general, I'd like to see placeholders for 
things that we don't have techniques for so it's all in one place.

Although it may not be obvious to the casual reader, most of the practices which gratuitously fix the pixel size of the content - such as using GIFs to display text - are discouraged in the WCAG. 
As Charles says, there are problems with images where contemporary media are not scalable and W3C has SVG under development to help. 
However, in the short term I would also suggest that she evaluate Opera for her use because it may make enough difference to be worth the change.

I have been contacted by a partially sighted lady here in the UK who is 
using a 
particular Acorn Archimedes screen magnification system. 
She is experiencing problems when trying to view some Websites. 
She is under the impression that Web designers are able to code Webpages so that horizonal scrolling will never be necessary by users of magnification 
software. 
Here's what she says in a messasge to me: " Formatting. 
I'm still concerned that this issue doesn't seem to be 
amongst 
the ones you raise with designers. 
Yet it's quite crucial for anyone using screen enlargement, like me. 
I need to be able to format all text to about 50-character lines, and a 
resolution 
width of 440 pixels. 
Do you take this into account when advising clients? 
Some sites reformat automatically, giving me line lengths that fit my screen. 
Others have a fixed line length, which makes me have to scroll across, which is very bad for my eyes :-( Can you add automatic reformatting to your desired parameters, please?" 
My response to this lady so far has been that I didn't believe it was 
possible to 
fix the width of pages without the use of tables (which then causes 
problems for 
other Net users). 
Doesn't all magnification software (such as Zoomtext) require horizontal scrolling? 
Is is realistic to expect all Web designers to put text with 
fixed-width 
tables/frames (I think not!). Am I missing something? 
Or should I advise this lady that there is 
nothing that 
can be done to help her and she should get some new software (which she is very reluctant to do)?

Prompting the page author to reduce horizontal scrolling is a good idea but 
it doesn't seem to be covered specifically in the WAI WCAG. 
Should we bump 
this back to that group for comment? 
Should the ERT include techniques that 
are not specified by the WCAG? 
My feeling is that the current ERT should cover the current WCAG only.

The guideline to use markup which imparts logical structure rather than physical parameters of presentation is already in the WCAG and can be used as the basis for most ERT-feasible screening methods to catch gratuitous fixed sizes in web page layout. 
The fact that scrolling is a bummer belongs in the reference note giving the usability background for the WCAG and related policies pushed by the WAI. 
That note is not chartered to paper over what we knew when the WCAG was released but rather to track the current state of human performance knowledge as it impinges on access to the information in web content. 
This is a tension we need to think about a little more. 
I don't want to assume you can invest the effort to edit a more broadly scoped document. 
On the other hand, from a WAI-PF perspective and an EO perspective there is motivation for wanting the ER-IG to produce something that is broader. 
In other words, anywhere software algorithms applied to web content will detect opportunities to improve usability by people with disabilities is of interest. 
We can sell more usability increasing tools than we can sell inaccessibility reducing tools. 
Why don't you and Len think about how to handle this. 
Maybe Len can keep an issues list which will keep placeholders for techniques that we don't develop right now in the ERT volume. 
If so I would suggest the ERT volume have a Scope section including a link to the issues list for a treatment which is broader but less deep. 
We already have the scope issue about color in styles. 
The A-Prompt is not going to inspect styles at this point but checking for color in the styles is clearly part of an appropriate technique to evaluate web content to see if the guideline which says "never use only color..." One of the missions of the ER-IG is in fact to turn up shortcomings in the WCAG for the next release. 
So if we have a concept for an evaluation and repair technique which is implementable and works and is not traceable to the WCAG, we need to look on the other side at why it isn't in there. 
Sometimes it is an underlying format and protocol issue, and the action should flow to PF to get the prerequisites into the generic Web technology. 
I ust copied here a quote from a post to xml-plenary in which I plead for multi-level partial understanding (incremental discovery of semantics) as an underlying principle of the architecture of the future Web. 
This is particularly with application to a stylesheet transformer, which would work better than the present CSS cascading algorithm to adapt styling.
