<s> Hi Folks, I am a bit confused about what a functional property is.  </s>
<s> Let me give an example: Let the property be: lengthOf - it maps a River to a Distance Suppose that one instance document asserts this: The Yangtze has a lengthOf 6300 kilometers.  </s>
<s> A second instance document then asserts this: The Yangtze has a lengthOf 3937.5 miles.  </s>
<s> If lengthOf has been declared "functional" then we can infer that: 6300 kilometers = 3937.5  </s>
<s> miles.  </s>
<s> Is the purpose of functional to enable inferences like this? /Roger  </s>
<s> Roger - way cool example - (Jeremy, I wonder if we should make this one of our test cases for Owl Full).  </s>
<s> This is definitely one of the uses for functional property.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, I don't believe that we can capture this in OWL, as there is no way to apply a unit to an XML Schema data type, and certainly not to specify the relationship between two values having different units.  </s>
<s> If OWL supported binary datatype predicates (in fact it only supports unary datatype predicates), then one way we could do this would be to define a pair of functional datatype properties called something like kLength and mLength, and a binary datatype predicate called something like ratio1.6:1.  </s>
<s> Then we could make the assertion that allValuesFrom((kLength,mLength),ratio1.6:1) must be true in all cases (i.e., subsumes Thing).  </s>
<s> Even this doesn't exactly give you the inference you suggested - it tells you that anything having both a kLength and an mLength that are not in the ratio 1.6:1 is logically inconsistent.  </s>
