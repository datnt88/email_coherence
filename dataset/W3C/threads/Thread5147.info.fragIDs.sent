<s> This can be done already by specifying the width and height of the image, and also providing a viewBox that sets up the map-coordinates to physical-coordinates relationship.  </s>

<s> Oh, yes, I agree you can have a complete control on what part of the drawing the user will see, in terms of drawing coordinates or even of geographic coordinates in SVG1.1.  </s>
<s> But on the subject of printing, I think that's not enough to manage rendering scale : you also need to have complete control on or information about physical aspects of the support, e.g. at least a way to map your drawing units to paper units.  </s>

<s> I'd be delighted to give you this kind of thing, but unfortunately there isn't yet.  </s>
