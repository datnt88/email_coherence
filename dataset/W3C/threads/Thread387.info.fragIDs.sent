<s> Hi All Below are text from two BATCH files, then some comments, I'm not sure if I would pass the Microsoft batch file exam, but these files do work for me.  </s>
<s> ================= run_tidy.bat  </s>
<s> ============================== check_it fileName html rem check_it space FILENAME space EXTENSION ==================== check_it.bat  </s>
<s> ========================== find /v /n "" %1.%2  %1-%2_num.txt  </s>
<s> copy %1.%2 oldver.htm  </s>
<s> tidy.exe -f %1-%2_notes.txt  </s>
<s> -modify %1.%2 copy %1.%2 new_%1.%2  </s>
<s> copy oldver.htm  </s>
<s> %1.%2 del oldver.htm  </s>
<s> ===================== comments ============================= To run this as you would need of course "TIDY.EXE" also "RUN_TIDY.BAT"  </s>
<s> &amp; "CHECK_IT.BAT" also the file to be checked, it might be "NEW.HTML"  </s>
<s> To make the batch files you would need to make two text files with "note pad" copy &amp; paste the text given above save the work and change the file name to the two batch file names given.  </s>
<s> "RUN_TIDY.BAT"  </s>
<s> &amp; "CHECK_IT.BAT"  </s>
<s> BEFORE YOU START Edit the RUN_TIDY batch file and replace "fileName" with the name of your file like NEW ( you might also have to change HTML to HTM ) TO START Click onto the file "RUN_TIDY.BAT"  </s>
<s> WHAT HAPPENS WHILE YOU WAIT "RUN_TIDY.BAT will run the batch file "CHECK_IT.BAT" from the text given it will make %1= fileName and %2=HTML As it is running "CHECK_IT.BAT"  </s>
<s> A file called "fileName-html_num.txt"  </s>
<s> Then it copies "fileName.html"  </s>
<s> to "oldver.htm"  </s>
<s> Then it runs tidy &amp; makes notes to file called "fileName-html_notes.txt" &amp; fixes errors and modifies "fileName.html"  </s>
<s> Then it copies you modified version to "new_fileName.html"  </s>
<s> Then it copies your original html file back to your original "fileName.html"  </s>
<s> Then it deletes the file it made called "oldver.htm"  </s>
<s> NOTE The reason it makes a text file with numbered lines is if you are a computer that does not have a HTML editor.  </s>
<s> ======================== Question =============================  </s>
<s> Is there some other and better way maybe with click-on style "buttons" to change TIDY options easer?  </s>
<s> It would be great if TIDY printed to file the whole line that had any errors on it,  </s>
<s> From Eric  </s>
<s> You may want to try out some of the HTML editing tools that include Tidy along with dialog boxes for configuring it.  </s>
<s> Check the Tidy home page for links.  </s>
<s> I probably am misunderstanding you, but Tidy does already offer you the means to write errors to a file ( -f filename ) Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
