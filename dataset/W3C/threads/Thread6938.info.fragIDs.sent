<s> One reason you need a mapping between Contentxt-Types and URIs is that one must be able to introduce new non-standard context types with all the benefit of URI machinery - Anyone can make a new one - Choice of schemes with different properties of identity, dereference, etc - Ability to talk about them for example wiht RDF and all other languages which use URIs.  </s>
<s> I agree, but this seems very different from the mapping proposed by RFC 3023 [1] which defines a mapping from a (namespace) URI into a content type based on an IANA registration and a new "+xml" syntax convention for XML based content type names.  </s>
<s> RFC 3023 suggests content types for several W3C defined languages including SVG, RDF, MathML, and XSLT all of which are identified by namespace URIs.  </s>
<s> This seems to go in the direct opposite direction by  </s>
<s> forcing central registration of names that were designed not to be.  </s>
<s> Is this the direction we want to go?  </s>

<s> Where does 3023 propose such a mapping?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Mark Nottingham, Research Scientist Akamai Technologies (San Mateo, CA USA)  </s>
<s> Through the central registration process.  </s>
<s> This is for example how the "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" namespace identifier identifying the SVG language is proposed to be mapped into "image/svg+xml".  </s>
<s> This is of course not an automatic mapping but a mapping nonetheless.  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
<s> It's not a direct mapping; media types are used for dispatch and identifying the document, whilst namespaces are used for identifying (but not dispatching) XML elements.  </s>
<s> As a result, it's many-to-one; in time, there could be several versions of SVG (and hence namespaces) mapping to image/svg+xml.  </s>
<s> This is a somewhat desireable effect of using media types; not disasterous to lose, but worth bearing in mind.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the mapping is arbitrary; for example, an RSS 1.0 document's root namespace is that of RDF, yet there is still a need (satisfied by media type) to identify that document as RSS.  </s>
<s> I think the question here is whether a namespace URI can be used to identify a document, for purposes of dispatch, as well as identifying (some of) the XML elements within.  </s>
<s> My impression of the namespaces discussion is that using them for dispatch in XML is overloading them; it isn't designed into them, but it can be done with careful thought.  </s>
<s> Using them as document identifiers would seem to be more of the same.  </s>
<s> This is interesting in light of the XML Processing Model workshop; I don't think namespaces and media types as dispatch mechanisms weren't talked about very much.  </s>
