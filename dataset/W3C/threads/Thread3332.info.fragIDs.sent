<s> Maybe this has already been considered ... it's obvious enough, but the thought has only just struck me.  </s>
<s> It occurs to me that the FOAF experiment of Dan Brickley and friends (and  </s>
<s> FOAFs) might have some relevance to some aspects of trust modelling.  </s>
<s> I'm scratching some words about public key certificates and CA chaining, and got to this point: t So X.509 employs the idea of certificate chains, where each CA's public key is itself signed by a "higher" CA, and so on until a trusted "root" CA is encountered.  </s>
<s> Thus, a chain of certificates can link the holder of some key and a user of the corresponding public key to a common point of trust.  </s>
<s> Set against this, the longer the certificate chain the more scope there is for compromise of any one of the CA signing keys, which would effectively nullify the basis for trust in the end user keys thus protected.  </s>
<s> /t This describes the X.509 hierarchical CA chaining model.  </s>
<s> PGP, on the other hand, employs a more grassroots based web of trust, in which any keyholder can express degrees of trust in another.  </s>
<s> In his book "Applied  </s>
<s> Crytography", Bruce Schneier puts it like this: There are no key certification authorities; PGP instead supports a "web of trust".  </s>
<s> Every user generates and distributes his own public key.  </s>
<s> Users sign each other's public keys, creating an interconnected community of PGP users.  </s>
<s> All of which has strong resonances with FOAF.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking in particular that:  </s>
<s> (a) FOAF might be used to model PGP webs-of-trust.  </s>
<s> (b) FOAF might be able to supply additional information about relationships, which could be used to guide trust decisions in a PGP web-of-trust.  </s>
<s> (c) with a FOAF model and trust strategies modelled as rules on RDF data,  </s>
<s> some PGP trust decisions might be automated that otherwise are made manually.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... I must pay more attention to the next IETF key-signing party.  </s>

<s> I've always felt that SPKI/SDSI [1] is a very interesting model of security which fits rather nicely with the semantic web:  </s>
<s> o Rights certificates are bound directly to keys ("principals") not to identities.  </s>
<s> x.509 effectively maps rights to identities but SDSI separates these.  </s>
<s> This leads to a decentralized design where everyone can be a sort of certification authority, no need for a global hierarchy.  </s>
<s> This separation also means you can have some level of privacy and yet still exercise certified rights.  </s>
<s> o The notion of local namespaces that map from "principals" (i.e. keys) to some name or identity is very consistent with foaf.  </s>
<s> First you could use foaf/vCard/person-ont to associate your own names and contact information for principals that you know.  </s>
<s> This could be either informal or formally done by SDSI identity certificates.  </s>
<s> Secondly the SDSI principle of addressing people via chains of names in linked local namespaces would fit very nicely with using FOAF "knows" links.  </s>
<s> o The delegation certificate machinery is a good base for allowing authoritative sources to delegate their authority.  </s>
<s> It could be an interesting way of approaching the semantic web trust layer so that when a package of assertions is signed it can signed on behalf of some delegation chain giving a traceback mechanism.  </s>

<s> I hadn't thought of SPKI in this context.  </s>
<s> I agree the directness and relative simplicity appeals, especially when the additional metadata carried in X.509 certs might be supplied as signed RDF.  </s>
<s> But ... I was of the impression that SPKI is not widely used: do you know otherwise?  </s>
<s> Do you think it's a serious contender in the public key security space?  </s>

<s> I agree it is not widely used and that is something of a problem.  </s>
<s> HP did implement it for the ESpeak product though that is not widely used either ...] However, the attraction of SDSI is it's decentralized nature - you don't need global PKI to make it work.  </s>
<s> So it could be bootstrapped up for specific applications relatively easily.  </s>
<s> I guess I was just wondering whether some of the SDSI design principles could be reused in developing semantic web trust layer demonstrations.  </s>
<s> Just a passing thought.  </s>

<s> BTW: After I spoke to DanC about representing SPKI in N3, he created an example and policy:  </s>
<s> On a quick review, it certainly *seems* to be more deployable (in terms of additional data to be shipped) than X.509.  </s>
<s> I don't know if XKMS would change that.  </s>
