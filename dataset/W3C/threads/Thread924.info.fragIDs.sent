<s> Hi! I'm new to jtidy and I have a question I can't find an answer to.  </s>
<s> Hope someone on this list can give me a hint :) I use jtidy to parse a html document so I can save some metadata.  </s>
<s> These data I use to create a modified version of the same document.  </s>
<s> Some of the tags, i.e. the body-content, I want to save "untouched".  </s>
<s> Is it possible to let jtidy give me the offset (start and stop) of a node/tag?  </s>
<s> Then I can just use substring to get the content without doing som  </s>
<s> regexp etc.  </s>
<s> If not, it would be nice if jtidy could give me i pretty print of one node/tag or give me a part of the original document.  </s>
<s> Then I can get a script tag as is and save this for later.  </s>
<s> Is this possible?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance!  </s>
<s> Regards, Endre... :)  </s>
<s> Hi, JTidy won't do outputting of the original HTML string out-of-the-box.  </s>
<s> Not sure how difficult it is to add.  </s>
<s> But the Jivan HTML (Re)Parser can do it out of the box.  </s>
<s> Whenever you do not change a node, the Jivan Parser will return the original HTML string for that node (and subnodes).  </s>
<s> Check out www.jivan.org  </s>

<s> Thanks for your answer.  </s>
<s> Is it possible to let JTidy output i modified html for a chosen node, modified to the better?  </s>
