<s> This is part of my promised response to Jon's proposals for subsetting checkpoints by applicable browser type.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that checkpoint 5.4.1 (access to individual cells) needs to be met for all User Agents which render tables (and all user agents should render tables...) In the case of the garden variety browser, a simple example is the user who has a magnified screen.  </s>
<s> (Or where the table is very large.  </s>
<s> This is a problem I had yesterday, at a fairly standard font size.)  </s>
<s> In order to provide access to the content of a single cell, techniques include allowing cells to take a focus (in the HTML event model, although it has other problems, it is expected that any rendered element can take the focus).  </s>
<s> A simpler technique which can be implemented by most graphic browsers is to provide the user with the option of placing a border around each cell.  </s>
<s> The up/down and left/right navigation that can be used to make sense of a table (although it is not especially easy, with a large table, it does work) can be provided by allowing the user to scroll the viewport laft/right and up/down over a view.  </s>
<s> All the graphic browsers I have seen (Arachne, DocZilla, HotJava, IE, Mosaic, Navigator, Opera) manage this already.  </s>
<s> Navigation of the DOM tree would also enable identification of individual cells, since they are nodes on the tree.  </s>
