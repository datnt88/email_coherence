I took an action to explain methods of dealing with attachments etc in W3C lists. 
The following describes some policy, which in summary is plain text is best html or xhtml is second best The harder case that is not explained in full is what do you do when you have content in some proprietary format, particularly if the files are large. 
e.g. 
I had a document in a proprietary format that I wished to send to the www-rdf-interest list. 
Step 1) Create a PDF (if necessary this might been creating a postscript file and then converting that with ghostview) Step 2) send PDF as attachment to www-archive@w3.org 
This mailing list is public but no natural subscribers, and is intended for large attachments, amongst other purposes. 
Step 3) Find URL of attachement by looking at Step 4) Send URL to the intended mailing list e.g. see where I note the long URL got mangled ... Reviewing the policy I probably could have created an xhtml version with only a little more effort than the PDF and that would have been better. 
It is particularly important to use this technique of sending to www-archive when the attachment is large. 
If you wish to send something with member confidentiality to a public list the same technique can be used by sending to w3c-archive@w3.org which is archived at If you have a complex set of interlinked files in the same directory it is possible to send them all as attachments to www-archive and the links will be maintained. 
Example is: Jeremy I find when writing collaboratively that MS Word's "change tracking" and editing facilities are very useful. 
Sure there are ways to do this in HTML (like inventing a style sheet with a "change" tag), but they are not automatic and require just enough extra work that it tends not to get used. 
Mike (Smith) and I tried doing that while editing the guide, and it just didn't work. 
Mike ended up just doing diffs every time I made changes. 
Anyway, I would never force MS Word on anyone, but it may make sense for smaller groups, like task forces for example, where all the member of the group agree, to use something like MS Word for developing a document, and then posting the HTML version of it when it's in some version-able draft form. 
This way the process is still "open" (in that there are free MS Word "readers" out there), but the work doesn't have to be encumbered by lack of tool support.

Example is: Jeremy HERE HERE!!! I was going to express the exact same sentiment. 
One possibility would be to always send a .pdf 
along with any proprietary formats. 
The key is to NOT "encumber progress by lack of tool support." as Chris so well put it. 
Chris: please forward this to the list for me, I still cannot post to it.
