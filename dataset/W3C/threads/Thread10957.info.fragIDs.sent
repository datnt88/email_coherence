<s> According to draft-ietf-822ext-mime-reg-03, rfc1590, and rfc1521, the message that begins the discussion should look something like the one I've appended below.  </s>
<s> Please review and comment if you are familiar with this process.  </s>

<s> Got it -- thanks Terry.  </s>
<s> The fact that the RFC states preference for US-ASCII was kinda my point.  </s>
<s> Since the default charset for XML is not US-ASCII, I don't think the assumption in RFC 1874 is valid or useful in XML.  </s>
<s> And yes, I think the RFC should be changed, not XML.  </s>
<s> From the XML 1.0 spec: This specification depends on the international standard ISO/IEC 10646 and the technically identical Unicode Standard, Version 2.0, which define the encodings and meanings of the characters which make up XML text data.  </s>
<s> Relevant quotes from RFC 1874 follow.  </s>
<s> Section 2.1 describes text/sgml as being employed when software is meant to be human-readable: 2.1.  </s>
<s> Text/SGML MIME type name: Text MIME subtype name: SGML Required parameters: none Optional parameters: charset, SGML-bctf, SGML-boot Encoding considerations: may be encoded Security considerations: see section 4 below Published specification: ISO 8879:1986 Person and email address to contact for further information: E.

<s> The Text/SGML media-type can be employed when the contents of the SGML entity is intended to be read by a human and is in a readily comprehensible form.  </s>
<s> That is the content can be easily discerned by someone without SGML display software.  </s>
<s> Each record in the SGML entity, delimited by record start (RS) and record end (RE) codes, must correspond to a line in the Text/SGML body part.  </s>
<s> SGML entities that do not meet the above requirements should use the Application/SGML media-type.  </s>
<s> A document in UCS-4 Arabic is certainly intended to be read by a human.  </s>
<s> The problem doesn't seem to be use of RS and RE per se, it's their transformation into multibyte Unicode equivalents.  </s>
<s> [...describing the 'charset' parameter...] charset The charset parameter for Text/SGML is defined in [RFC-1521], the valid values and their meaning are registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [RFC-1590].  </s>
<s> The default charset value for all Text content-types is "us-ascii" [RFC-1521].  </s>
<s> The charset parameter is provided to permit non- SGML capable systems to provide reasonable behavior when Text/SGML defaults to Text/Plain.  </s>
<s> SGML capable systems will use the SGML-bctf param- eter.  </s>
<s> What needs changing is the definition of MIME 'text/*' from 646 to 10646,  </s>
<s> not a UCS-4 document instance into an 'application/*' MIME type.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, MIME is inextricably bound to US-ASCII, which seems a mistake.  </s>
<s> I'm sure someone more qualified than I has argued this out in the MIME/SGML WGs.  </s>
<s> XML may simply be among the first applications requiring this type of i18n modification to what are gradually becoming outdated specs.  </s>
<s> Murray Murray Altheim, Program Manager Spyglass, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts "Give a monkey the tools and he'll eventually build a typewriter."  </s>
<s> This has been discussed to death by myself, and others.  </s>
<s> The MIME folk are ware of the problem, but there seems to be no resolution pending that I am aware of.  </s>
<s> Note that MIME has to be backwards compatible with RFC822 by default, and with existing mail and netnews gateways -- it isn't only used for HTTP, of course... Other applications get round this by using a MIME Charset: header, I think.  </s>
<s> But I'm not sure how to get an existing or nearly-existing httpd server to add Charset lines wiothout hacking it, unless you put the MIME headers in the file and use .asis  </s>
<s> processing (where supported).  </s>

<s> Many current servers allow you to add the charset label on the HTTP Content-Type field.  </s>
<s> Apache and Netscape certainly do.  </s>
