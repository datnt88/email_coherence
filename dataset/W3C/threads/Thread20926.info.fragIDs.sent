<s> Amaya is able to support a lot of encodings.  </s>
<s> It just needs to know what encoding is used to interpret correctly the received value.  </s>
<s> Today the default encoding is ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> Of course if the value is UTF-8 encoded, Amaya wan't interpert the character correctly.  </s>
<s> A possible solution is to let the user change the encoding.  </s>
<s> There is a global variable called Default_Charset in the $AmayaHome/thot.rc that allows to force the default encoding, but there is no UI to change this value.  </s>
<s> Perhaps setting this value to UTF-8 or UNICODE-1-1 will solve your problem?  </s>

<s> It didn't work; I tried the values UTF-8, UNICODE-1-1, utf-8, and unicode-1-1.  </s>
<s> BTW, in addition to changing Default_Charset, I also changed DOCUMENT_CHARSET to utf-8 with Amaya's GUI.  </s>

<s> It appears that X was extended for UTF8 strings: (from Markus Kuhn's Unicode FAQ Looking at get_targets in thotlib/dialog/appdialog.c Amaya currently only supports STRING, not UTF8_STRING.  </s>
