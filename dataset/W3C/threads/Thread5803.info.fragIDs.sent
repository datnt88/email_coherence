<s> Why  </s>
<s> You've got property restrictions in OWL Lite, but only using named classes.  </s>
<s> Anonymous classes are not permitted in OWL Lite restrictions.  </s>
<s> See the following section from the Feature Synopsis.  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-features-20020729/) ... OWL Lite has a subset of the full OWL language constructors and has a few limitations.  </s>
<s> Unlike the full OWL language (and DAML+OIL), classes can only be defined in terms of named superclasses and only certain kinds of restrictions can be used.  </s>
<s> Equivalence for classes, and subclass between classes are all only allowed on named classes.  </s>
<s> Similarly, property restrictions in OWL-Lite use named classes.  </s>
<s> Yes, rdf:type is how you specify classes as instances.  </s>
<s> I think that in OWL Full the following would be ok also.  </s>
<s> They are local.  </s>
<s> From the OWL Reference:  </s>
<s> "OWL cardinality restrictions are referred to as local restrictions since they are stated on properties with respect to a particular class."  </s>
<s> subclasses? Yes.  </s>
<s> Can you give me an example of what you are looking for?  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> Micheal, Thanks for the reply.  </s>
<s> 1. Can you please give an example of property restriction using named classes only.  </s>
<s> In the http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-guide-20021104/ document, if i understand correctly, there are only examples of restrictions using anonymous classes.  </s>
<s> "...The highlighted subclass restriction defines an unnamed class that represents the set of things with at least one madeFromGrape property.  </s>
<s> We call these anonymous classes [OWL DL]." 2. user-defined facets.  </s>
<s> We would like to capture some additional restriction/information on the property relation, without having to reify the property.  </s>
<s> For example: a 'capacitor', may have a property called "capacitance" with a certain value and we would also like to know the "technical source" of the value and keep that information on the property.  </s>
<s> Or, if "transaction" is a property relating a buyer and a seller we would like to capture the date/time of the transaction as additional information on the property itself.  </s>
