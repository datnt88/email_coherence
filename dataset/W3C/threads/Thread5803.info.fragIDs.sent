We are trying to build an ontology building/editing environment for business end users, using OWL as the underlying representation language and it would be helpful to get some clarifications about the language. 
1. Are local property restrictions not part of OWL Lite? 
(somewhere the doc. 
says OWL DL next to anonymous classes) Having local property restrictions specified as anonymous classes, makes it difficult to present 
this information to an end buisness user in a clear and meaningful way. 
Why 
are local property restrictions specified as anonymous classes instead of say just specifying the restrictions on the class directly? 
2. Is "rdf:type" the correct and only way for specifying classes as instances of other classes? 
3. Can minCard, maxCard and cardinality restrictions be applied to global property definitions or are only allowed for local property restrictions? 
4. Are local property restrictions on a class, inherited to its subclasses? 
5. We have a requirement for representing user-defined facets. 
How can these be specified in OWL? 
Thankyou in advance for your replies Aseem Das Black Pearl Inc. 
Why 
You've got property restrictions in OWL Lite, but only using named classes. 
Anonymous classes are not permitted in OWL Lite restrictions. 
See the following section from the Feature Synopsis. 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-features-20020729/) ... OWL Lite has a subset of the full OWL language constructors and has a few limitations. 
Unlike the full OWL language (and DAML+OIL), classes can only be defined in terms of named superclasses and only certain kinds of restrictions can be used. 
Equivalence for classes, and subclass between classes are all only allowed on named classes. 
Similarly, property restrictions in OWL-Lite use named classes. 
Yes, rdf:type is how you specify classes as instances. 
I think that in OWL Full the following would be ok also. 
They are local. 
From the OWL Reference: 
"OWL cardinality restrictions are referred to as local restrictions since they are stated on properties with respect to a particular class." 
subclasses? Yes. 
Can you give me an example of what you are looking for? 
Hope this helps.

Micheal, Thanks for the reply. 
1. Can you please give an example of property restriction using named classes only. 
In the http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-guide-20021104/ document, if i understand correctly, there are only examples of restrictions using anonymous classes. 
"...The highlighted subclass restriction defines an unnamed class that represents the set of things with at least one madeFromGrape property. 
We call these anonymous classes [OWL DL]." 2. user-defined facets. 
We would like to capture some additional restriction/information on the property relation, without having to reify the property. 
For example: a 'capacitor', may have a property called "capacitance" with a certain value and we would also like to know the "technical source" of the value and keep that information on the property. 
Or, if "transaction" is a property relating a buyer and a seller we would like to capture the date/time of the transaction as additional information on the property itself. 
Thanks Aseem

It might be worth mentioning that they can be given global effect simply by asserting "Thing" to be a subClassOf the relevant restriction.
