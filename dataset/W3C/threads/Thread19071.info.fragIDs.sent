<s> My original comment was related to the fact that in my first proposal I pointed out that graphic images of text have some features of text content (like the fact that they rely on written communication) and some features of non-text content (like the fact that they are not able to be rendered as characters on the screen which can also be spoken by a speech synthesiser...) I think that this should not be in the definition (as Kynn pointed out) but should be in the relevant places in the various guidelines - primarily in WCAG as far as I can tell.  </s>
