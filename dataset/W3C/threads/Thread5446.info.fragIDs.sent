<s> Hi, Does any one have any idea of what the results were for the Jan 6, 2004 ruling to stay both the jury award and the modifications to IE? Like many of you, our sites uses a lot of embedded plug-in code and I would prefer not to implement the workaround if there is a stay.  </s>

<s> Behalf Of TheoDP@aol.com FYI Friday's Chicago Tribune reported a federal judge will rule Jan. 6 on Microsoft's request to stay the jury's $520 million award until the USPTO reexamination is done.  </s>
