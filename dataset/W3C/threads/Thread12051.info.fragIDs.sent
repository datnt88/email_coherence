Reference Document: 1) The first sentence of the rationale sounds like an inevitability. 
I propose rewriting it as follows: "When adding features to software, developers must ensure that they are integrated into the overall "look and feel" of the software. 
Consistency promotes accessibility and acceptance of new features. 
2) Checkpoint 2.5.1: Could be split into two checkpoints. 
Not crucial. 
3) Checkpoint 2.6.1: Change "which" to "that" several times. 
4) Checkpoint 2.6.2: 
What does the "nature of an alert" mean? 
Does this mean "severity"? 
5) Checkpoint 2.6.3: Change "which" to "that" several times. 
6) Checkpoint 2.6.5: Change "accessibility status" to "document accessibility status". 
7) Checkpoint 2.7.2: Change "Explain the use of accessible 
authoring practices" to "Explain the accessible authoring practices". 
8) Checkpoint 2.7.3: Change "Examples must not use inaccessible markup" to "Do not use inaccessible markup in examples." 
My comments sprinkled throughout - look for IJ and CMN Reference Document: 1) The first sentence of the rationale sounds like an inevitability. 
I propose rewriting it as follows: "When adding features to software, developers must ensure that they are integrated into the overall "look and feel" of the software. 
Consistency 
promotes accessibility and acceptance of new features. 
CMN Actually, I propose expanding slightly on your text, so it reads 
...Consistency promotes both accessibility of the tool and author acceptance (and therefore use) of new features 
However I will not make either change to the draft for the Interest Group on Monday, unless there is strong support and no dissent from the list during the day. 
IJ 2) Checkpoint 2.5.1: Could be split into two checkpoints. 
Not crucial. 
CMN Noted as issue for working group IJ 3) Checkpoint 2.6.1: Change "which" to "that" several times. 
CMN I did a global search/replace for them. 
One of the features of an Australian editor I guess *grin* IJ 4) Checkpoint 2.6.2: 
What does the "nature of an alert" mean? 
Does this mean "severity"? 
CMN I think it means the nature - its severity, the way it appears, etc. 
I don't think we should constrain this too much, although we may want to give examples of possible changes in the techniques document. 
IJ 5) Checkpoint 2.6.3: Change "which" to "that" several times. 
CMN Done IJ 6) Checkpoint 2.6.5: Change "accessibility status" to "document accessibility status". 
7) Checkpoint 2.7.2: Change "Explain the use of accessible authoring practices" to "Explain the accessible authoring practices". 
8) Checkpoint 2.7.3: Change "Examples must not use inaccessible markup" to "Do not use inaccessible markup in examples." 
CMN These seem like simple editorial changes - unless there is any dissent they will be made.

How else would you measure acceptance besides use? 
I don't think the parenthetical is necessary (but it's not a problem either).

I agree that it's important to be flexible, but imprecise language should be avoided. 
The word "nature" to me, implies something that cannot be changed by the user - something's nature is inherent to it (e.g., human nature). 
Actually, I don't think alerts have severity - errors have severity. 
Alerts just let you know what the severity is. 
Proposed: "Allow the users to control the timing and presentation of alerts." - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs
