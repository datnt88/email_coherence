<s> On 16 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>

<s> B.9 Should XML require system and public identifiers to be FORMAL (13.5)?  </s>
<s> This needs interpretation.  </s>
<s> The FORMAL keyword in SGML does not restrict system identifiers to any formal structure.  </s>
<s> The important question is: If system identifiers are retained in XML must they conform to the rules for formal system identifiers defines in ISO 10744?  </s>

<s> For XML 1.0, we need to keep things as simple as possible.  </s>
<s> The simplest solution is: - No public identifiers, formal or otherwise.  </s>
<s> - System identifiers must be URLs.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's part of our job in this WG to try and solve the WWW's naming/addressing problems.  </s>
<s> The mechanism that the WWW currently uses for identifying entities is URLs.  </s>
<s> We should simply adopt that into XML.  </s>
<s> If we incorporate public identifiers, we would need to define a mechanism for resolving them to URLs.  </s>
<s> There is not time to do that before November.  </s>
<s> They can always be added in XML 1.1.  </s>
<s> I don't think formal system identifiers buy us any functionality that we have to have in XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> They can be added in a future version; this would be backwards compatible since any legal formal system identifier is not a legal URL.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Using FPI's and FSI's for naming is simple enough.  </s>
<s> The really hard part is name *resolution* (ie.  </s>
<s> turning a name into a physical adress that can be accessed).  </s>
<s> I agree that we cannot solve the resolution side by November, but XML naming conventions certainly can be resolved by then.  </s>
<s> Again, if we have an extensible naming scheme with a robust grammer, then I am all for it.  </s>
<s> [Gavin, beginning with a quote from James:]  </s>
<s> Putting on a third hat this time... (Note that I am now speaking as one with a vested interest in this question.)  </s>
<s> In the general scales-to-the-edges-of-the-galaxy scenario in the context of which this is usually discussed, the resolution problem is a well-known nightmare.  </s>
<s> In the more limited case where one is only interested in defining location-independent identifiers for a few thousand publications and only needs to resolve those identifiers within a corporate intranet space, however, the resolution problem is a pussycat.  </s>
<s> At Sun, we are putting into place an intranet publishing solution that relies on FPIs and the SGML Open catalog system (including Tauber's DELEGATE extension) to provide location-independent naming of our technical manuals and other publications.  </s>
<s> This system allows users to install individual publications in multiple locations on a network without worrying about what happens if one of the servers goes offline for a while, and we believe that it will provide very substantial document management benefits moving forward.  </s>
<s> We don't expect everyone to follow our lead in this, but it would be a good thing for us to have FPIs as they are currently defined be part of what you can legally put in an XML document.  </s>
<s> So this (not disinterested) user strongly supports Gavin's position.  </s>

<s> Most people dealing with XML probably already have code to use.  </s>
<s> For those that don't, I don't see 5000 lines of code as a major overhead, because the code is very straightforward.  </s>

<s> The constraints can be removed over time, but the foundation cannot be relaid time and time again.  </s>

<s> Subject: Re: B.9 Formal system, public identifiers?  </s>
<s> How do FSIs offer this?  </s>
<s> What makes you think URLs can't offer indirection?  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> URLs can provide indirection (or at least a server can) but they  </s>
<s> bind the resolution protocol at the time the name is assigned.  </s>
<s> Using URLs as the only syntax for system identifiers doesn't allow other  </s>
<s> forms of name to be used later on.  </s>
<s> If we specify FSI syntax, and then restrict the FSIs to be URLs, there is a nice path to more-robust identifiers at no more cost than we incur by implementing URLs to begin with.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if we allow FPIs and restrict our catalogs to mapping FPI - FSI, the implementation will be a lot simpler than current SGML implementations.  </s>
<s> We need not even use the SGML/Open catalog syntax if it makes parsing to hard.  </s>
<s> Having the FSI syntax to allow extension seems easy and foresighted to me.  </s>
<s> FPI's may add complexity (in that they need to be resolved, but if we have external entities at all, FPIs should be available -- We need the slot in the syntax if we ever want to have the FPI/FSI distinction -- and it is a critical distinction.  </s>
<s> So I guess I think we need to FPIs into the syntax even if we consciously decide not to specify how they should be resolved.  </s>
<s> (Assuming that we have external entities at all.  </s>
<s> On that question I can't make up my mind.)  </s>
<s> If we are to eliminate the distinction between FPI and FSI (or URN/URL or pointer/name, choose your terminology), then we would have to eliminate URLs and other pointers I think, and standardize on FPIs only.  </s>
<s> However, this would fly in the face of familiarity, and be hard to  </s>
<s> implement, so we should probably avoid the high road on this issue.  </s>
<s> But making it impossible to ever do the right thing and use location independent naming seems a high price to bear.  </s>
<s> -- David RE delenda est.  </s>
<s> I didn't say that URLs don't offer indirection, only that there are  </s>
<s> better opportunities with FSIs.  </s>
<s> With an FSI, I can add my own storage object handler to pull the doc out of a DMS, for example.  </s>
<s> With a URL, I  </s>
<s> would have to go through a gateway to accomplish the same purpose.  </s>
<s> If you've ever had a key gateway crash because the process table overflowed, you understand my reluctance to be cornered into this.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> There is a cost to the user: instead of entering a kind of thing they are familiar with, namely a URL, they have to enter something that they are not familiar with, namely an FSI.  </s>
<s> If we stick to URLs now, we can still support FSIs in the future: any FSI  </s>
<s> must include  and  but these two characters are not allowed in URLs.  </s>
<s> It's ridiculous to force users to type url at the beginning of all their URLs when it's completely unnecessary to do so.  </s>
<s> URL syntax is extensible: why can't it be used to do location-independent naming?  </s>
<s> Something like fpi://W3C/DTD/HTML_3.2 is a perfectly good URL.  </s>
<s> I can't resolve it, but then I can't resolve FPIs either.  </s>
<s> Location-independent naming is not a problem specific to XML.  </s>
<s> We should use whatever general solution gets adopted for the WWW, rather than trying to come up with a solution specifically for XML.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> Why can't you add a URL scheme to do this?  </s>
<s> It's just as easy for an entity manager to recognize a URL scheme name and pass the scheme part off to some handler as it is for it to recognize a storage manager name and pass the SOI off to some handler.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> Sure, but then the URL is just a dummy.  </s>
<s> Why force me to invent a scheme like that?  </s>
<s> It's too messy.  </s>
<s> I like to have things that do what you expect them to do.  </s>
<s> If it looks like a URL, it is a URL, and it should resolve a URL.  </s>
<s> Trying to make it into something else is too much like server-side includes, yeccchhh.  </s>
<s> I just can't see myself explaining to people: "Well, true.  </s>
<s> It looks like a URL, but it is really this other thing...." bob  </s>
<s> No-one in the world has any XML code today.  </s>
<s> There are people with URL-handling code, but there are very few people in the world with FSI code.  </s>
<s> Most of it was written by James, in fact...  </s>
<s> For me, if something takes James 5,000 lines, it is probably complex enough that I would leave it out of the XML implementation I was thinking of writing in my spare time when it settles down.  </s>
<s> If FSIs end up being required by XML, I won't use XML for my purpose.  </s>
<s> Although I can write about 500 lines of working C in a day, I am very tired on the next day :-), and it takes several days of debugging.  </s>
<s> So I can get between 100 and 300 working, tested, debugged lines of code done in a day, averaged out over a week.  </s>
<s> So FSIs may take me more than ten weeks.  </s>
<s> Well, I don't think that counts as not a ``major overhead''.  </s>
<s> If it takes me ten weeks to implement a parser for all of XML, you can forget it.  </s>
<s> I would expect to be able to write a simple style-sheet aware browser in less time than that!  </s>
<s> (the last one took me about 2 or 3 weeks, but it wasn't very good :-) )  </s>
<s> A possible compromise might be to allow a url: prefix to a URL, and say that.  </s>
<s> This is forwards compatible -- you can add URNs later when they are working, and any other mechanism you want.  </s>
<s> Note that one very very useful feature in Panorama is support for partial URLs.  </s>
<s> A system identifier of "docbook.dtd" is interpreted as relative to  </s>
<s> the file containing that identifier.  </s>
<s> Hence, if we used File- Open to open a file containing that system identifier, Panorama looks in the same directory as the document you just opened.  </s>
<s> But if ftp was used, Panorama will use ftp to fetch "docbook.dtd"  </s>
<s> from the remote computer, again in the same directory.  </s>
<s> And if http was used... well, you see the pattern :-)  </s>
<s> This means you can test your SGML locally on a networked or local disk, then yes exactly the same unchanged files to test with a web browser.  </s>
<s> No changes means no errors.  </s>
<s> If URLs are used in XML, let's also allow partial URLs, as in HTML, and say  </s>
<s> that _all_ system identifiers are treated in this way.  </s>
<s> It really does work, and there is a sample implementation you can try... Lee  </s>
<s> This was one of my original dislikes for FSI's: namely that they add a lot of syntax for no apparent benefit.  </s>
<s> In the long run though, it's all just syntax, and I think that one thing FSI's do bring to play is that you can add attributes to the address.  </s>
<s> This can be very useful for things like specifying encoding etc (yes, you could also use RFC 15XX mechanisms to encoding strings, but that is not a easy for users to type).  </s>
<s> True, but I haven't seen a good general purpose solution from the WWW yet either.  </s>
<s> BTW.  </s>
<s> Do you see URI's as addresses or names?  </s>
<s> I tend to think of them as pointers into a large shared address space.  </s>
<s> True, but they do have URL and/or name resolution code.  </s>
<s> Well, that's you.  </s>
<s> I would use them.  </s>
<s> Well, one of my strengths is prototyping, and the best I've ever managed was 40,000+ lines of C++ in a month (working, reasonably well tested, but not production level code), and recently 27,000 lines of JAVA in 3 weeks, but that says little about the *type* of code.  </s>
<s> FSI's and whatnot are simple enough to make them a SMOP, especially if they are constrained by a "minimum" level of functionality.  </s>
<s> I would also expect free code to be made available over time.  </s>
<s> Or constrain the possible set of FSI's...  </s>
<s> Relative URLs?  </s>
<s> They are very useful, and a standard feature in most browsers now.  </s>
<s> The question: are the WWW protocols the responsibility  </s>
<s> of any notation or any language for defining a notation?  </s>
<s> In a framework, protocols can always be added, but for system integration and stability, redoing existing ones is expensive.  </s>
<s> After so many years of work in HyTime, I do not wish to see the strong concepts of HyTime location and address types disappear.  </s>
<s> But at this time, the established WWW protocols are in place and they work.  </s>
<s> XML has the power to return to us the capability to design our own structures and use them as see fit in operations on the data.  </s>
<s> To me, there is the evolution of XML.  </s>
<s> Version 1.0 should be be a perfect fit to existing frameworks.  </s>
<s> Else, it will not be adopted.  </s>
<s> VRML used this strategy successfully.  </s>

<s> Here is a possible solution to the impasse between FSI and URL-only.  </s>
<s> The FSI design effectively treats an informal system identifier (i.e., an ordinary string) as a default storage object specification.  </s>
<s> The usual default is OSFILE.  </s>
<s> For XML, we could let the default be URL.  </s>
<s> In other words, for a URL you could enter either: or url http://www.exasperated.org  </s>
