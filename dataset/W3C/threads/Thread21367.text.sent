Hi guys, I am trying to delete an annotation from Java with no luck. 
The server returns a HTTP 500 error. 
I know that my code is wrong because I can easily delete annotations from Amaya. 
(The web-interface also fails) there are no reply's to the annotation. 
Does anyone know what is wrong? 
String annotation = "http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/Annotation/1028082170.43327"; 
String ai = "username:password"; String authinfo = new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(ai.getBytes()); 
URL url = new URL(annotation); HttpURLConnection huc = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection(); 
huc.setRequestMethod("DELETE"); huc.setRequestProperty("Authorization","Basic "+authinfo); huc.setRequestProperty("Accept","text/xml"); InputStream is = huc.getInputStream(); 
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr); String line = ""; while ((line = br.readLine())!=null) 
System.out.println(line); br.close(); /Claus The only time I've seen 509 is deleting annotations with replies. 
Matthew Server must have been unstable - works fine now - thanks.
