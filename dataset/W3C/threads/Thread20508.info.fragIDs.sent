<s> Is it possible to add a confirmation window to the print icon and the print shortcut in order to prevent accidental printing?  </s>

<s> Thanks, Karl-Michael  </s>
<s> I vote against this request.  </s>
<s> I hate those 'are you sure', 'are you realy sure', 'are you realy realy sure' windows for non destructive actions.  </s>

<s> For future amaya versions, the icon bar can be made customizable just like  </s>

<s> Well, technically printing is a destructive action.  </s>

<s> Though I think we are all used to the destructive use of electrons most actions involve so I don't think we have to worry about that.  </s>

<s> Probably yes but we (the core team) don't time to work on this kind of feature currently.  </s>

<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Good thinking, The core team should be focused on the amaya core.  </s>
<s> Why is there a difference between the unix and the M$Windows variants here?  </s>
<s> Remove the difference and work on one source.  </s>

<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> But if the windows behaviour, i.e. Amaya asking what to print, with a cancel option is built into the Linux version, that would do it as well.  </s>
<s> Karl-Michael  </s>
<s> There is a difference here because we want to use the standard Windows interface to select the printer and its options.  </s>
