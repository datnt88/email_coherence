I need data from any content providers on this list! 
When you do hit counting: Do you count HEADs and GETs as hits? 
Do you count conditional GETs that return 304 (Not modified) as hits? 
(I.e., where the requester already had a copy of the page, and was just checking to see if it was up-to-date.) If you are not a content provider, but have information about their practices, I'd love it if you contributed it as well. 
(It would be nice if you indicated it was second hand...) Thanks! 
Redmond, WA 98052 It isn't content providers you need to ask - it is the people who write the log analysis programs. 
Few people roll their own. 
I am one of those people who have written a log analysis package for public use ( URL:http://www.netimages.com/~snowhare/utilities/ ) so.... 
I count whatever the server writers put in their log: GET, HEAD, POST - whatever. 
Yes. 
I also account for them seperately to allow measuring how significant code 304's are on a particular server. 
I *don't* count codes 302, 400, 401, 402, 500 or 501, except in seperate categories just for those codes.

When Paul you do hit counting: There is an effort underway to define a MIB for http and web servers in general. 
There was a BOF on this at the 35th IETF in LA. 
The work is summarized on the web at http://http-mib.onramp.net/ 
Currently the latest draft is http://http-mib.onramp.net/draft_2.my 
Most probably this MIB development will become part of the charter of the Applications MIB Working Group. 
Paul Do you count HEADs and GETs as hits? 
The MIB counts each request type individually (for each virtual server). 
Paul Do you count conditional GETs that return 304 (Not modified) Paul as hits? 
(I.e., where the requester already had a copy of Paul the page, and was just checking to see if it was Paul up-to-date.) It also counts each response type individually (for each virtual server). 
Carl Carl W. Kalbfleisch This is the day which the LORD hath made; cwk@onramp.net -- Psalm 118:24 In a kind of addendum to what I said in my other reply, I have just released a free basic log analyser for the Apache cookie_log. 
This (at least attempts to) measures the number of unique session accessing pages on a site. 
The perl script can be found at measurement is, of course, completely different than those of traditional access_log analyzers because it only counts unique sessions and not total hits. 
The script is not a full featured analyzer, but a basic overview tool. 
Benjamin Franz Duh. 
URL:http://www.netimages.com/~snowhare/utilities/cookiestats.html is the correct URL. 
Benjamin Franz The log analysis software that we license to our customers whose sites we develop (TrafficWatch) counts the HEAD, GET and POST queries together. 
TrafficWatch is configurable to allow customized profiling of the standard logfile format records, but no customer has requested to differentiate between the request types. 
Our own profiles across all sites we host show very few HEAD queries (less than .01%), 
so the magnitude of possible inflation of the totals is of little concern to them. 
They are mostly interested in configuring various graphical representations of the various hit populations according to content or client characteristics.

No. Our customers are concerned with the relative interest shown by their audience in their various online resources. 
The marketing logic that is being applied currently is not comprehensive enough to weight conditional vs unconditional, HEAD vs GET etc, in determining where they're getting their value. 
TrafficWatch is reconfigurable to allow for the development of useful principles for evaluating any of the values recorded in the log. 
Once the marketing principles for qualifying the various kinds of Web-mediated impressions are established, the analysis will be able to produce meaningful data. 
Until then, the scarcity of non-GET/POST queries and the lack of a context in which to interpret them statistically renders that kind of report nothing more than a distraction. 
However, TrafficWatch could be used to analyze the logs in order to identify trends in the appearance of such data.
