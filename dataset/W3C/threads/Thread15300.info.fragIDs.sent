Dear friends, now, in Europe, is a great moment about accessibility: 1) in Italy we have the new Law 2) the Europea Plan "MINERVA" has published in november 2003 the official "Handbook for quality in cultural Web sites" [1]. 
It is an important step into the european cultural life on the web, because the states members of UE will translate it in the own language and then will be applied. 
The goals about accessibility in this "Handbook " is is to follow the W3C WAI recommendations like primary condition, and we are very happy of this.
