<s> employee could go to p .  </s>
<s> The only structural change that would be  </s>
<s> changing staff to html body .  </s>
<s> Though the resulting HTML document would be gibberish (but valid gibberish), it would then allow most of existing tests to also be automatically translated and you would add 300+ tests that would now run on HTML, XHTML and XML implementations.  </s>

<s> Hi Manos, Thanks for the files.  </s>
<s> Let me see if I understand how to use these...First, you created a staff module, and pulled it and the relevant xhtml modules together.  </s>
<s> Then, you have a staff.xml that conforms to the above.  </s>
<s> But, because it is just a sample, it only contains one employee -- it would have to be updated to be compatible with the existing staff.xml.  </s>
<s> You also supplied a stylesheet that can be used to translate staff.xml to it's xhtml version.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to translate to an html version?  </s>
<s> So, in order to use this, I have to update staff.xml, and then translate to xhtml and html.  </s>
<s> But the advantage is that we do not have to do hand translations... Am I close?  </s>
<s> If not, please let me know, as I would like to understand this approach fully.  </s>
