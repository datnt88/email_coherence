<s> So far I've received the following straw poll results: Jim Amsden: all  </s>
<s> Tim Ellison: all Mark Hale: all Juergen Reuter: all Eric Sedlar: all, but not at sufficient detail to do implementation work Lisa Dusseault: yes, but not recently  </s>
<s> I think we can safely assume Geoff Clemm has read the entire draft, and Greg Stein has also presumably reviewed and/or implemented a fair portion of the options as well.  </s>
<s> Bottom line, there appear to be 5 people who have reviewed all options, and three who have reviewed a subset.  </s>
<s> Any others out there?  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Yes, I've reviewed the entire document.  </s>
<s> I would say that I have implementation experience with most of the options, but in "prototype" form (waiting for the spec to settle down before committing serious effort).  </s>
<s> John  </s>

<s> No, that is not exactly what I intended to state (you silently dropped the clause starting with "but"...).  </s>
<s> I am also fine with: "yes, but not at sufficient detail to do implementation work".  </s>
<s> Greetings, Juergen  </s>
<s> I have also read the specification, but not at a sufficient level to start implementing.  </s>
<s> However, I have been tracking the discussion w.r.to the semantic consistency issue that Tim so eloquently expressed.  </s>
<s> That was important for me.  </s>
<s> The system that we implemnted (not using Delta-V) did implement several of the options with a simple "consistency" model.  </s>
<s> Hence I wanted to make sure that we would not be forced to reinvent the wheel and worse yet lose the simplicity of our core model.  </s>
<s> I seem to recall my last *serious* review, with the intent of finding errors and providing feedback, was in July.  </s>
<s> Since then, I've been reading various sections at different times, on and off.  </s>
<s> I've pretty much read (several times, in varying detail) through all but the workspace option.  </s>
<s> I should probably do a hard-core read, though.  </s>
<s> My implementation has been pretty light, in kind of a breadth-first approach.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
