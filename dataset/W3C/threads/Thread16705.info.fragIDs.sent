<s> Hi All try this one, http://www.abilitynet.co.uk/fullvis/index.htm  </s>
<s> Opinions please.  </s>
<s> This site has just won a 3 year sponsorship from British Telecom for their excellent work on promoting accessibility on the internet.  </s>

<s> The portal website for disabled people and associated professionals.  </s>
<s> In the spirit of not trashing sites that seem to have made some effort I will not detail the problems I had with the first page/frameset.  </s>
<s> I do think this site is a pretty good example of how passing Bobby does not tell you much about the accessibility of a site.  </s>
<s> What exactly does "winning a sponsorship" mean?  </s>
<s> Does this mean the site will be considered a good example?  </s>

<s> The home page of this site is not accessible.  </s>
<s> According to checkpoint 2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup [Priority 1], the phrase in the middle of the page "Note the menu option in RED on the left hand side of your screen.  </s>
<s> This button will take you to AbilityNet's Chat Room, Message Board, Guest-book and our NEW Mailing List service."  </s>
<s> This is a priority 1 and makes this site non-accessible.  </s>
<s> Actually, I don't believe it necessarily makes the site non-accessible (to whom?  </s>
<s> everyone?) but I do think that it makes the site confusing as it's harder to locate the menu option.  </s>
<s> It's okay to _use_ red as part of a design.  </s>
<s> The problem here is actually with the _phrase_.  </s>
<s> This particular phrase uses the two terms "RED" and "left hand side".  </s>
<s> If that phrase did not _exist_, would this specific accessibility problem exist?  </s>
<s> Assuming (which may not be the case) that the red button on the left hand side can be _identified_ in some way as the "menu option", then, no, this is _not_ a priority 1 violation.  </s>
<s> The information is available in more than simply color.  </s>
<s> It may be harder to find because of the _phrasing_, which is confusing, but "harder to find but not an absolute barrier to access" is a priority 2 violation, by definition.  </s>
<s> Confusing phrasing -- language which is dependent upon a specific presentation but which does not absolutely prevent someone from getting at the content -- is not covered by WCAG checkpoint 2.1.  </s>
<s> In fact, it's not covered by any WCAG checkpoint, to the best of my knowledge.  </s>
<s> If it were, it would be a P2 according to WCAG 1.0 priority definitions.  </s>
