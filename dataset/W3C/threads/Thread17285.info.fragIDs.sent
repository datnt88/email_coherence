Hello all when checking http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/plugins/education/ics/default.asp in JAWS 5 I noticed some strange behaviour using Firefox. 
On the first select box it JAWS reads out "minus some enormous number of zero". 
Using IE6 it reads out the correct "1 of 3" (or whatever it actually is). 
Has anyone come across this before and if so any idea what's happening. 
NOTE - The page is very much work in progress and not intended for public consumption so, please, only comments connected to this issue (and possibly the use of DOM scripting). 
many tia

Maybe off topic, but...is JAWS *meant* to work with Firefox (or rather, let's turn this around...is Firefox correctly working with Windows' MSSA)? 
It may be an issue on Firefox's end... Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford 
Hhmm... hadn't thought of that. 
Surely JAWS is *meant* to work with anything that is text-based on a Win machine. 
Is there a reader that is independent of MSSA that I could use as a test?

Sure any screen reader should not crash, and most text should be available, with any Windows application, but to "work with" is quite another story. 
Someone referred to MSAA in this thread. 
In fact JAWS uses the IE DOM and parses the HTML. 
More and more screen readers are accessing the private information of the application. 
That wasn't true in my screen reader for OS/2 days but it was essential to tailor the careen reader, to have made a "profile," for any application you really wanted to use.

Right. 
I believe that some other Windows screen readers are designed more generally, to take maximum advantage of whatever accessibility stuff is in Windows. 
Talking to other screen reader developers, it seems that isn't as easy as it should be :( For many screen readers you can write a profile to get them working better with whatever application you think of. 
But I would suggest that one of the things to test is whether Firefox is putting information out to MSAA properly, by checking with some MSAA-based system. 
(I don't know if there is one, or if you'd need to look around for testing software. 
Aaron Leventhal might have the answers you're looking for. 
He hangs out in mozilla-accessibility).

JAWS works best with IE (unfortunately) I have never had a problem with Firefox on Windows or Linux but using JAWS with Firefox requires a customised script for proper functioning. 
There may also be a bug in JAWS 5, my colleague prefers a previous JAWS version because he has had some problems with the latest one, though I can't remember them off the top of my head.

it's simply that freedom has not put support into jaws for anything but ie on the browser front for quite some time I think the last netscape version they actually supported was v 4.75. 
If an application uses msaa, jaws or another msaa enabled screen reader still has to hook into it with some work from the screen reader development end. 
If an application does not use msaa, this is still the case. 
If an application uses standard windows ui, it is highly possible that jaws will work with it with maybe a tweek or two that a competent user can perform -----Original Message-----

The IBM Software Accessibility Testing Checkpoint (see Note 1) on testing gives some guidance here: Test using accessibility test tools such as Inspect Objects. 
Inspect can be used to determine whether there is an accessibility problem with your application or with the screen reader. 
If your application is coded correctly, but the screen reader does not read the application, use Inspect to verify that the right information is available to the screen reader. 
If Inspect provides accurate information in the Name, Value, Role and State fields, but the screen reader does not read the information, it is probably a screen reader issue and not a problem with your application. 
"Inspect Objects" comes as a utility with MSAA from Microsoft (see note 2). 
But as Jim and others have said, screen readers (for example JAWs) may be looking at the DOM and not MSAA at this instance. 
I've heard that Window Eyes (see note 3) uses MSAA more frequently than others. 
What I've found NOT possible is to tell the screen reader where to get information via a profile or script. 
For example, scripting functions in JAWs are where the script writer ask JAWs a question and gets a response. 
JAWs internally determines where to look for the answer, which may or may not be MSAA. 
But the script writer has no way to tell JAWs where to look, only to use the exposed list of function calls that are available. 
Which only makes sense, cause if I tell a screen reader to look for the information in MSAA, but it doesn't have the support coded to do that yet, how would it answer?

but just because it works on a Win machine does NOT make it accessible. 
it must work cross platform on ALL operating systems to be accessible 
try EMACspeak

True, but for me using a Windows machine, it has to be accessible on Windows and, to be honest Bob, that's all I'm worried about at the moment. 
Call me selfish but unless it works on my set up I can't put a lot of effort into thinking about it working on others. 
I don't understand this argument Bob. 
I'm talking about a client side application that is governend by the user's choice of operating system. 
The cross-platform aspect of web accessibility surely comes into play when ensuring that the server-generated content is not OS specific. 
I obviously should have clarified things and asked for readers that are independent of MSAA but run on Windows. 
By your own criteria EMACspeak is not accessible either (unless someone has ported it to Win and Mac by now) Julian The information in this email is confidential.
