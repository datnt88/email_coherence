<s> Dear WAI Interest Group Participants: A new Working Draft of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) is available for your review.  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 addresses accessibility of Web sites for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> It applies to a wider range of Web technologies than WCAG 1.0, and is intended to be understandable to a more varied audience.  </s>
<s> Since the previous public Working Draft of WCAG 2.0, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG), chaired by Gregg Vanderheiden and Jason White, has incorporated comments received, and further developed the guidelines and checkpoints in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> W3C Working Drafts provide opportunities for public comment during the development of a specification.  </s>
<s> The ealier in the development process comments are received, the greater impact they may have.  </s>
<s> The WCAG WG invites you to comment on their latest Working Draft, available at: by sending comments to the public mailing list: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  </s>
<s> The Working Group welcomes your thoughts, including on the following questions: 1.  </s>
<s> In general, is this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft easy to understand?  </s>
<s> Please identify sections or phrases that are difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> Please suggest alternative wording for the Working Group to consider.  </s>
<s> 2. The priority structure of this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft differs from WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Is this structure easy to understand?  </s>
<s> Would it be effective?  </s>
<s> 3. If your site or organization already uses WCAG 1.0, do you think it would be difficult to migrate from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0?  </s>
<s> What would make it easier?  </s>
<s> Please note that the Working Group is developing supporting documents, such as technology-specific techniques documents, for WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> Please send your comments by October 18, 2002, to: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  </s>
<s> The archive for that mailing list is available at: We would also like to bring your attention to "Requirements for WCAG 2.0" document, which explains the Working Group's goals for WCAG 2.0, based on feedback from WCAG 1.0, including improving the usability, understandability, and applicability of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is available at: When sending comments, please: - State the issue as clearly and simply as possible.  </s>
<s> - Provide links to specific examples or references.  </s>
<s> - Suggest solutions if possible.  </s>
<s> - Remember that the Working Group welcomes volunteers to help with the work.  </s>
<s> When waiting for responses to comments: - Track your issue in the open issues list - Follow up on the mailing list if you don't find your issue in the open issues list.  </s>

<s> I just read through the draft to get a feel for how hard it would be to change from 1.0, which we currently use as a standard for many of our sites.  </s>
<s> While I am in great sympathy with all of the checkpoints and I wish everyone could do them all, I  </s>
<s> do honestly think it would be difficult to migrate.  </s>
<s> I wish I had time to go through it all thoroughly and give more detailed comments, and maybe I'll have time to articulate more, but I do want to at least say that one thing that could make it easier would be something along the lines of "If you currently meet WCAG 1.0, here is what is needed to meet the minimum level of WCAG 2.0".  </s>
<s> Something like the checkpoint mapping, but cut down to cover WCAG 2.0 minimum level only.  </s>
<s> That would help me anyway!  </s>
