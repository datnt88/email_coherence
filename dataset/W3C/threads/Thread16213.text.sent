I was told AltaVista had released a super-lean search service, along the lines of google. 
So I tried it. 
Annd this is what I got: We're sorry. 
Raging.com does not support text-only browsers. 
For a superior text-only search, please visit [link]AltaVista. 
I faked my user agent string, and got a perfectly usable (nice, clean, simple) search engine. 
Anyone have a constructive approach to the problem? 
Charles McCN W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia I believe you will be pleased with the interface to AltaVista that is available with the SETI-search search engine at not-for-profit search engine interface designed for blind and low-vision users. 
AltaVista is the default search engine, so you only need to enter your search term or phrase into the form and submit it. 
There are also interfaces to AOLsearch, Excite, Google, HotBot, MetaCrawler, CNET, Dictionary.com, DiscoveryHealth.com, AllRecipes.com and Voila.com (just recently added). 
Since the major engines are constantly changing/fine tuning their algorithms, it is a struggle to keep up with them...but we try, and user feedback helps us a lot. 
It was our frustration with AltaVista and the other major search engines that caused us to develop this speech-friendly search engine interface. 
It works well with text-only browsers. 
(If you have any sort of problem using the tool, please use the on-site form to email us!) Everyone's feedback and suggestions are most welcome.

Charles McCN W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Thanks - I did prefer it. 
However, I am also interested in whether anyone has a constructive suggestion for how to approach the people who make Raging and fix it...
