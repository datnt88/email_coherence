We may want to add a tip telling folks not to write their page headers like this: O L Y M P I C S The NBC had this all over their site during the Olympics coverage and were very surprized when I protested-- they made some poor hapless human type in all those spaces because they wanted it to stand out.

I've seen that elsewhere. 
This is a good first class guideline, not just a tip I think, and there is a CSS property we can mention (letter-spacing). 
How about a guideline in the first section, Style and Structure that incorporates the last guideline of the Images and Image map section that currently reads: Recommended Avoid ASCII art. 
Replace it with an image and alternative text. 
Common typographic characters or constructions to be avoided are emoticons and arrows consisting of dashes and greater than signs (e.g., -- ), etc. to say something like, Recommended Avoid ASCII art and non-letter characters within words. 
* Replace ASCII art with an image and alternative text. 
* Replace common typographic characters or constructionswith appropriate language. 
For example, wink for the emoticon ;-), "therefore" for arrows consisting of dashes and greater than signs (e.g., -- ), and "great" for "gr8." * Remove spaces within titles (e.g., O U R C A F E); use style sheets to control letter spacing. 
This is recommended because the current recommendation regarding ASCII art is recommended. 
Should the rating be reevaluated if we include new information? 
Do these things make a page unusable for a person with a disability? 
Is it appropriate to lump all of these together or should they be separate guidelines? 
--wendy be taken In response to Wendy's question, I think the suggestions referring to ASCII art can be given as a single guideline; the avoidance of spaces and non-alphanumeric characters within words deserves the status of a separate guideline. 
It should be categorised as "recommended", given the strict definition of "required" which is in place.
