Also, if there is a section that you're particularly keen on, feel free to have rough drafts started ready for discussion for this call. 
Brian, please consider a report from this teleconference an agenda request for Friday's RDF Core call.

cambridge, ma 02139 usa Hmm... "RDF Primer is a non-normative document ..." I'd like to nip this sort of tone in the bud. 
I'd rather the first sentences in the document were something light and energetic like... RDF is a nifty technology for integrating all sorts of stuff... for getting the computers to acutally help solve problems, rather than just shuttling them between people. 
If you're new to RDF, or you have been put off by all the stilted language-lawyer-ese RDF documentation, this document is for you!

I agree with Dan. 
It may be necessary for "official reasons" to include these statements, but it seems to me they could go at the end. 
As part of the core "primer" material, it might be reasonable to include some discussion about the relationship of the material in the Primer to the actual specs, expressed in normal English (i.e., not using terms like "normative").

You've already got the sort of material I had in mind, at the end under "Template Introduction". 
I'll be out of email contact most of today, but hope to have some additional ideas for communication this evening when I get back. 
However, a couple of initial comments: 1. 
We might want to think about adding to the scope some discussion of types and examples of available tools (e.g., from the W3C RDF pages, and from the DAML tool set) that can help people create and process RDF (since we're asking people to do additional work, we might want to indicate that there is some software, even if only in prototype form, that can help with the work). 
2. In Section 1, I think we want to make sure that people see the motivation for RDF somewhat independently of the "Semantic Web" (the "S word" sometimes turns people off, I find). 
That is, we need something like RDF for various practical reasons, which happen also to be the motivation for "the Semantic Web". 3. The ToC suggests we don't get to actually talking about RDF until Section 5. If the preceeding sections are short enough, that may be OK, but if they're too long, that may be too long a wait. 
Aaron's "The Semantic Web in Depth" http://logicerror.com/semanticWeb-long has relatively short sections discussing URIs and XML prior to discussing RDF, and this seems to work OK. --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 I agree, lets avoid abstractions as far as possible at the beginning of everything. 
Start with an example, would be better, as a way to introduce the points being made. 
Can we cook up a simple, artificial but convincing example/case study to use to illustrate the main points? 
It ought to show RDF doing more than XML would do :-) Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu 
Scope and Goals To explain RDF to the end user in such a way they in turn can explain it to others Good. 
To explain the benifits of a common model Good. 
To provide clear guidence to an end user how to use a vocabulary in RDF Good. 
To provide clear guidence to an end user how to create to create instance data based on supporting vocabularies Good. 
To clearly demonstrate to the end user the benifits of this approach Good. 
To highlight example applications that benifit from these methodologies... we're asking people to do extra work, we need to give clear indications of what the benifits of this extra work provides. 
I don't believe that using RDF necessarily does involve more work for application developers. 
I think that's something that came about because of the difficulty of understanding RDF M&amp;S 1.0. 
For specialized (i.e. most) applications, it is possible to define a form of XML that is very close to what one might naturally use, yet which is also fully acceptable to a general RDF parser. 
My point is to guide developers to a low cost of entry adoption of RDF, rather than try to convince them that it's worth doing a lot of extra work. 
I personally think the key to this is to show how the graph model relates to "ordinary" XML. 
To provide a general definitions of terms and shared semantics that are common across RDF Core specifications Good. 
Something that I felt was missing here was an explanation of the relationship between the abstract graph syntax and the RDF/XML syntax. 
At one level, I think we need to encourage designers to use the graph formalism to construct their data models, and separately from that show how the graph is easily represented in RDF. 
I think the biggest hurdle is to convey the idea of using URIs as property values (as in ex:property rdf:resource="http://example.com/foo"/ ) differently from other values. 
Open Issues Take on the explanation/relationship between RDF and XML Ah, I guess this is what I meant above. 
I could be persuaded to try and draft something. 
NTriples representation... this could help/hurt either way I'd play it down here unless it's really needed. 
Model Theory explanation e.g. 
That's something I suggested ... I would be prepared to have a go at drafting something around this.

The temptation to do a commercial is hard to resist. 
Profium's main product is an RDF-based routing engine. 
It uses available RDF sources to divert content to where it's required. 
It's RDF-based, it's working now and it's not directly part of the Semantic Web movement... But there again you don't necessarily want a commercial. 
I have managed to describe the application without too much of a sales pitch in the past. 
I could do it again.

I think that would have to be at least two examples. 
It is my view that the value of RDF is that it allows data/information to be shared between applications, and ultimately for some kinds of processing to be handled by generic software systems. 
So, I think the value to be demonstrated is when a new application is introduced that relevant data created by existing applications is accessible to the new application, and vice versa. 
TimBL once gave an example of an invoice for aircraft parts; some elements would be details of commercial transactions, generated by a sales/order processing system, while others would be related to the technical bill of materials for an aircraft, generated by engineering CAD software.

BTW, one thing that we ought to be able to do now is show an example where some/one/thing is able to figure out that two classes are identical by showing that each is a subclass of the other :-) Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu 
I'm agnostic on the specifics of the kick-off example to use. 
As long as it addresses the criteria of (a) being something people can relate to (e.g. solves a problem a lot of people have), (b) easy to understand, (c) demonstrates the benefits of RDF, I'm interested. 
I'd be interested in hearing your description of the application. 
If it meets the above criteria and just so happens to be supported industrial grade tools, thats even better!
