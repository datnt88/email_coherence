<s> To The Group - I cannot recall who it was that posted a message a few weeks ago about conformance claims and the fact that site developers are claiming to have  </s>
<s> met some level of WCAG 1.0 when in fact they fall short.  </s>
<s> My concern is that  </s>
<s> many site developers will boast the claim but NOT actually meet the guidelines.  </s>
<s> A bigger issue is - why do they think they passed in the first  </s>
<s> place?  </s>
<s> Many of the sites I've looked at could not have tested with a tool  </s>
<s> as they had no declared DOC TYPE and the pages would not parse.  </s>
<s> So - I  </s>
<s> assume they did some sort of manual check and assumed they met criteria.  </s>
<s> As we work on WCAG 2.0, I am guessing that there will be many individuals  </s>
<s> (well intentioned individuals) who will claim they have met conformance  </s>
<s> levels but have not.  </s>
<s> Is this an education and outreach issue or one we need  </s>
<s> to talk about in terms of content?  </s>
<s> If web developers think they are doing  </s>
<s> "it" right and they are not (in terms of adherence to the guidelines) -  </s>
<s> something is possibly missing (on our part).  </s>
<s> Or, possibly, something was  </s>
<s> "simply" overlooked when the site was checked for conformance.  </s>
<s> I am not sure there is an answer to these questions or concerns but have  </s>
<s> been paying attention to those sites that claim to meet WCAG 1.0 and have  </s>
<s> done machine and manual tests to determine the validity of the claims.  </s>

<s> For personal experience (I represent inside W3C IWA/HWG, the world biggest association of web professional), web develpers that don't work directly in accessibility initiatives, for reach the "minimum level of accessibility" only made the "Bobby" or other automatic testing tool validation.  </s>
<s> This is wrong also because these tools are not the "panacea" for the validation: for eg. a lot of these don't validate CSS so there is the pr oblem that if I use fixed size font the validator said me "xxxx approved for level AA" but if the font are fixed size i cannot declare level 2. The best to do is to create a policy maker (like this one: good faith declare what points its work reached.  </s>

<s> I wanna point also the focus about "Certification" of WCAG.  </s>
<s> There are lot of companies that are starting the "WAB" (Web Accessibility Business)... Today I've found this example: http://www.nfb.org/seal/wacs.htm  </s>
<s> and i think that there would be also other countries that will develop their certification program.  </s>
<s> I've also post in the AC Representative list this proposal: why don't add in the copyright section and / or in the "Conformance Claims" a text similar to this one: "Certification The materials contained in this web site must be considered as guidelines.  </s>
<s> No certification programs could be start using this material without a prior agreement with the World Wide Web Consortium".  </s>
<s> There are some tools around that allow the user to validate manually - this feature is starting to be integrated into automatic testing toools as well.  </s>
<s> I know that it is a part of HiSoftware's tools, and supervised some students integrating it into the Open source WAI-Nu evaluation tool.  </s>
<s> I got "not found" trying to follow the link below, but I also have produceed a tool for declaring point by point which checkpoints are met.  </s>
<s> It uses Xforms, so you need a browser capable of handling them - there are plugins avaiable for "current" browsers, and there are browsers that handle them natively such as DENG and Xsmiles.  </s>
<s> explains what I am doing, and there are several development versions with more interesting features that don't necvessarily work yet.  </s>
