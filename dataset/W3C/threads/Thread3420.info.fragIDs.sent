I'd like to come up with a good set of references. 
I'd like to start by listing sites that have articles about writing standards-compliant HTML or how to fix problems with proprietary HTML: * http://www.w3.org * http://mozilla.evangelism.bclary.com 
* http://www.webstandards.org * http://developer.netscape.com/evangelism 
Please add sites you know of to the list. 
As I receive responses, I will add them to my home page.

How about http://www.alistapart.com/ 
? 
Their articles include "How To Read W3C Specs" and "Modifying Dreamweaver To Produce Valid XHTML".
