<s> BRIDGEVILLE, Pa. (AP) _ Typical errands can be hard for the blind.  </s>
<s> A trip to the store often means finding transportation, walking through unfamiliar surroundings and then relying on clerks for help.  </s>
<s> But advocates for the blind are trying to make sure the Internet isn't so  </s>
<s> tough to navigate.  </s>
<s> One of the latest ways, they say, is the Pennsylvania ElectriChoice Program's Web site, which allows Pennsylvania customers to choose their power company.  </s>
<s> The program's Web site, introduced at a news conference Tuesday, (August 24, 1999) allows people to see images enlarged, hear text read aloud or read it themselves in Braille.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> ElectriChoice site, located at www.electrichoice.com, is designed to be used with magnification software, Braille displays, and screen "readers" that allow text to be read with speech synthesizers.  </s>
<s> Pittsburgh Vision Services and other groups dedicated to helping the blind and those who have poor eyesight are hoping others will use the technology that went into creating the ElectriChoice Web site to make their own sites more accessible.  </s>
<s> "If I find a Web site that's accessible, I'm going to buy from them as opposed to a Web site that isn't," said Spero Pipakis, who is blind and used the ElectriChoice Web site to change the company providing energy to his home.  </s>
<s> Pennsylvania is one of the few states where customers can do so, and roughly 450,000 have used the program to change companies so far, said PUC spokeswoman Maureen Mulligan.  </s>
<s> The state runs the program with power companies eager to benefit from customers scouring the Internet for cheaper rates.  </s>
<s> Crista Earl, a resource specialist for the New York-based American Foundation for the Blind, said blind people can have most of the text on the Internet converted to sound or Braille with technology like that used on the ElectriChoice Web site.  </s>
<s> In the cases of Web sites that are not accessible, blind consumers often stage e-mail or letter writing campaigns to complain, and most companies quickly upgrade their sites, Ms. Earl said.  </s>
<s> Vicki Vaughan, a member of a group called Visually Impaired Pittsburgh Area Computer Enthusiasts, said at least 40 percent of the Web sites she uses are inaccessible to the blind.  </s>
<s> That's especially bad because cruising the Internet would be an ideal way to avoid the inconveniences of shopping, she said.  </s>

<s> I dunno about the "rest of us" but it's very encouraging to see this kind of progress being touted as Important in an age when still most web designers are completely unaware that It Matters.  </s>
<s> So while we could certainly find reason to be critical of what they might or might not have done, I do applaud the idea behind the news story and the fact that it is considered Important Enough to be news.  </s>
<s> Now I'm looking forward to the day when this is NOT news and accessibility is taken for granted...someday, I promise you, we WILL get there.  </s>
