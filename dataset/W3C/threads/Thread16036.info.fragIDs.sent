Priority 2.1 states "Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also 
available without color, for example from context or markup." 
If I use a stylesheet to set "text-decoration: none" for links, does this violate Priority 2.1? 
At first glance, it would seem that the links are now distinguished only by text color; however, virtually every browser I know of has some way to identify links when they are in focus or mouseovered. 
By this I conclude that links are conveyed by markup and the text-color is an additional clue, not necessarily the primary clue. 
Therefore, I conclude that it would be okay on a link to do so, though not, perhaps, on other text. 
Priority 2.2 deals with having sufficient contrast between foreground and background. 
If a low-contrast combination is achieved via stylesheet (and therefore overrideable), would it still violate Priority 2.2? 
My feeling is that effects achieved with stylesheets should be less restricted so long as the page is understandable with the stylesheet turned off. 
Otherwise, Priority 2.2 would seem to rule out many artistic effects. 
What is the consensus on this?

I think you have correctly interpreted the requirements on links. 
I would recommend against the practice of removing some visually distinct characteristic, as being at least beneficial for people with cognitive disabilities. 
I would suggest that even using style sheets a low-contrast combination is not a good idea. 
It depends on how low the contrast is, of course. 
However the case that you are making would be supported by the fact that providing an accesible alternative is acceptable, if not recommended practise. 
Using technologies such as style sheets means that you are indded providing an accessible alternative, since they can be turned of or overridden.

I think it would take a few more before we could be talking about consensus...)

Stylesheets are a difficult thing to deal with when you're working with hard and fast rules. 
In the above example, yes, most people would only have to rely on color to identify the links. 
HOWEVER, if someone _needed_ a non-color distinction between links and non-links, they could easily add this using style sheets by creating their own user CSS file and specifying the following: A:link, A:visited { text-decoration: underline ! 
important; } The problem, of course, is that in order to do this, a user would have to learn CSS. 
The average web -designer- may not know CSS these days, so it's preposterous to assume that the average -user- will be able to craft a CSS file to account for her special needs.

Quoting a quote of Kynn Bartlett:

In my view, no. 
The guideline refers to using color without a semantic markup. 
Ie., using span style="color:red" instead of strong In case of links, you do use a semantic markup, the a tag, so the information is conveyed properly with semantic markup.
