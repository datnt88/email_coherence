<s> Thanks, Charles F. Munat  </s>
<s> I think you have correctly interpreted the requirements on links.  </s>
<s> I would recommend against the practice of removing some visually distinct characteristic, as being at least beneficial for people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that even using style sheets a low-contrast combination is not a good idea.  </s>
<s> It depends on how low the contrast is, of course.  </s>
<s> However the case that you are making would be supported by the fact that providing an accesible alternative is acceptable, if not recommended practise.  </s>
<s> Using technologies such as style sheets means that you are indded providing an accessible alternative, since they can be turned of or overridden.  </s>

<s> Stylesheets are a difficult thing to deal with when you're working with hard and fast rules.  </s>
<s> In the above example, yes, most people would only have to rely on color to identify the links.  </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if someone _needed_ a non-color distinction between links and non-links, they could easily add this using style sheets by creating their own user CSS file and specifying the following: A:link, A:visited { text-decoration: underline !  </s>
<s> important; } The problem, of course, is that in order to do this, a user would have to learn CSS.  </s>
<s> The average web -designer- may not know CSS these days, so it's preposterous to assume that the average -user- will be able to craft a CSS file to account for her special needs.  </s>

<s> The guideline refers to using color without a semantic markup.  </s>
<s> Ie., using span style="color:red" instead of strong In case of links, you do use a semantic markup, the a tag, so the information is conveyed properly with semantic markup.  </s>
