All: As discussed in our last telecon, here are your assignments. 
I have grouped each of your assignments and tried to make them consistent. 
Write to me with your heartburn. 
Note the numbers in this document pertain the new version I have just posted (revised on the airplane). 
Actually things are pretty close. 
I still need to finish incorping Deb and Mike's text. 
But it is coming along. 
Addison Martin: -3.3 XML Schema and RFC2277 (locale-independent datatypes). 
-I-013: needs rework -I-025: needs rework and a link to the requirements -4.3: Write text to deal with editorial note about chaining. 
Deb: -4.4.1: Pandora's box. 
Open it and deal with the consequences. 
(Suggestion: write a very small paragraph noting that this sometimes happens and may be unavoidable, but is still bad. 
Otherwise let's not deal with it: we are not writing an i18n primer). 
-4.5.1: character encoding of attachments scenario. 
-4.5.3: unsupported charset in request scenario. 
Expand text. 
Provide example. 
-5.1 Passing or matching international preferences. 
Ignore note. 
Write text. 
-5.2 Needs intro paragraph Takao: -5.2.1 Needs Takao's picture. 
-9.1 Review to see if there is any salvage. 
Otherwise let's remove it. 
-9.2 Ditto. 
-5.2.5 (was 9.3.1) 
Revise and fix up. 
-9.3, 9.4: Ditto of 9.2 -6.2.1 JIS vs. Unicode sort. 
Mary: -5.4 SOAP header structures. 
-5.5 Communicating locale preferences or input requirements in WSDL. 
Needs intro. 
-5.6 SOAP Faults and the Reason Text Element. 
This may need to go to oblivion, since we seem to cover it elsewhere?? -5.8 Introspection when writing WSDL Tex: -5.3 Providing support for locale patterns. 
(Might be too broad??) -Section 6: might be redund. 
-6.2 Ordering Grouping and Collation -6.2.2 curses (but not voodoo) Mike: -6.3 MM is doing this section -6.5 MM: suggest what to merge with the previous section on discovery (this is searching and seems redundant) -6.4 Human Readable text in WS (intro paragraph) -6.4.5 enumerated values and object names ("the name is the thing" problem... write to me if you can't decipher). 
Includes 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2 Andrea: -6.4.4 structuring documents -6.6.1 Times and Timezones -6.7 Regimes (intro paragraph) and 6.7.1. 
-6.9 Transports (intro paragraph) Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods | Delivering Global Business Visibility Chair, W3C Internationalization (I18N) Working Group Chair, W3C-I18N-WG, Web Services Task Force Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature. 
Okay, that was dumb... the new editor's copy isn't posted. 
When I go downstairs to WiFi land in the hotel I'll do that.... merci, Addison Addison P.

Extend claws and shred!
