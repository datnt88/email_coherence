Our next meeting is Monday January 15, 2001, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910). 
Agenda: 1. Lets decide whether to keep the name "Evaluation Description Language" (EDL) or Evaluation And Repair Language (EARL) or something else. 
By majority vote of whomever is present at the teleconference, excluding the chair (i.e. me) except to break a tie. 
I hope we can do this in 5 minutes max. 
If not, we'll try to resolve on the list. 
2. Testability. 
Over in WCAG there's been a debate about requiring web pages to be designed to facilitate testing for accessibility: and in particular mimimizing the amount of human effort required to verify accessibility--since it's the human effort that determines cost and speed in the long run. 
(Disclosure: I started it). 
- An agument for the requirement is that if accessibility is too time consuming and costly to test for, the testing wouldn't get done, and in practice, accessibility will suffer. 
Also, to the extent testing can be automated, the testing can be done independently by the person with the disability, which is in itself a desirable goal. 
- An argument against the requirement is that a page can be highly accessible even if it's hard for a third party to test, so the requirement does nothing to increase accessibility. 
Furthermore, accessibility can be provided by offering different version of a site to different users, which actually optimizes accessibility; but if the method uses proprietary rules those rules must be hidden, making it hard to independently test the accessibility "black box" fashion, so requiring testability is an unfair burden. 
(I may not be doing this counter argument-justice since I'm an advocate for the other side). 
The discussion in WCAG is the thread "Checkpoint on Accessibility" and starts at Also, there's a related matter in the thread, how to declare that a site is accessible, but I'd like to focus on testability. 
I'd like to see we can create a ER consensus position on this issue for presentation to WCAG. 
(of course, many of us are also part of WCAG, but not all of us are, and perhaps we can keep an ER point of view). 
(If you want to post a response to this testability issue, please start a new thread with subject e.g. "Testability". 
3. Open Issues. 
In preparation for the face to face meeting, what open issues do we wish to discuss with WCAG? 
The open issues list has WCAG issues denoted by the label [WCAG]. 
Note: Wendy may have an update of list by monday. 
4. If time (which is unlikely), discussion of testing Javascript. 
Len p.s. Have you registered yet for the face to face?

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE As someone who lives in a monarchy, I am rather fond of EARL. 
Besides, it reminds me that I should try to talk to someone of that name. 
I am sure there are other interpretations of any acronym we come up with. 
It doesn't matter much I don't think, so long as we provide an expanded form for each reference (e.g. once in an email message, in title attribute of HTML abbr/acronym element, as an HTML ruby, as the reference if we use a semantic-web technique for defining acronyms...) that we make to it.
