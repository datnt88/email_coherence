<s> You're right, of course, the test may well be changed as a result of the process I outlined.  </s>
<s> In any case I cannot see that as an argument to kepp the metadata separate, if the tests change, they remain one test; passsing them through a process does not produce more tests or more metadata.  </s>

<s> If we were to end up in a situation where there are different interpretations of the specification,  </s>
<s> Make that "when" not "if"; it happens for every specification.  </s>
<s> All you need is two different implementations, and you're pretty much guaranteed different interpretations somewhere.  </s>
<s> the DOM WG representative will be the person to either discuss this with the submitting party, or take it to the WG for clarification.  </s>
<s> The test is in the meanwhile frozen while being considered by either the DOM WG rep.  </s>
<s> or the DOM WG.  </s>
<s> I don't much care about the details of the procedure, though having resolutions that are prompt, responsive, and stable is an important part of the process.  </s>
<s> (The XML WG didn't deliver on those points; some resolutions took over a year to deliver, others didn't address the issue, and in at least one case there was a significant reversal.)  </s>
<s> In either case the test remins as is, so there seems to be no need to separate documentation from the actual test.  </s>
<s> Well, if the test remains as-is, then what changed as the result of that procedure you're outlining?  </s>
<s> Clearly, it's the test metadata, affecting outputs or their interpretation ... and likely descriptions explaining some of the inevitable strange consequences.  </s>

<s> Actually, in the interest of reducing the number of divergent implementations, it can be better to turn such "problematic" tests into multiple tests.  </s>
<s> That also lets "legacy" behaviors (such as "the way IE4 does it", just an example) be tested for in their own right -- sometimes they're essential conformance points for products, though one hopes not for W3C (which should flag all conformance bugs).  </s>
<s> So for example, a test expecting one outcome turns from a positive test to a negative test ... and a new test, with the "correct" outcome, is created.  </s>
<s> For the original test, only the metadata changes ... unless it's being used in a profile that tests against an alternate conformance point (not limited to earlier versions of the W3C conformance statements).  </s>
<s> If only metadata changes for that original test, then it's possible for the process to include audit-based self-checks.  </s>
<s> But if changing interpretations means changing everything about a test ... auditability gets lost, and along with it goes a key part of QA process integrity.  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> In this particular case, you either get the right number of attributes in the list, or you do not, and I think that needs to be preserved.  </s>
<s> Adding more tests could do two things: 1. Provide pass/fail better aligned with use cases deemed most important (tests that align better with use cases).  </s>
<s> 2. Determine exactly why the tests failed (more detailed tests).  </s>
<s> For example, Mozilla and IE would both pass the following tests, which might be better aligned with real use cases: 1.  </s>
<s> Does the attribute list array indexed by number contain each specified attribute a serializer would need to write (the main use for enumerating attributes by number)?  </s>
<s> 2. Can I do a getAttribute or namedItem on each attribute (default and specified) that is expected to be there and get the right value?  </s>
<s> But this is arguably tailored for known bugs in the browsers implementations.  </s>
<s> I am all for adding tests, but not for eliminating them just because they discover non-compliance.  </s>
<s> Eliminating them is fine if we discover that they do not validate implementation of the spec.  </s>
<s> Neither browser would pass more detailed tests that I would like to see: 1. Examine the existence, type, and value of every standardized property and method of the returned attribute list and the nodes it contains, as well as individually-requested attribute nodes, making sure they are correct.  </s>
<s> There would be quite suprising failures.  </s>
<s> I think the browsers need to pass this more stringent test for real interoperability.  </s>
<s> With small fixes, I think Netscape would pass.  </s>
<s> 2. Test failure cases for proper results when an attribute does not exist.  </s>
