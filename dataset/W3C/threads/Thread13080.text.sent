WAI sites should be self-exemplifying...following the guidance that we espouse" Do as we say, not as we do?

Right on, Sister Sarah! 
Love. 
It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious! 
My goodness...what have I missed since I've been out of town?? Carol That said, I think it is extremely important that the WAI pages in particular, but all the W3C pages, look good. 
As someone who's studied web design for years (the evolution of design, if you will) and as someone who only recently started designing sites, I can whole-heartedly agree with Sarah's assessment. 
One of my personal goals is to combine the aesthetic and the accessibility of design. 
An accessible site shouldn't always be unappealing, and unfortunately, many are. 
The choosing of fonts, font colours, and layout should combine a harmonious balance of usability and good looks. 
I'd love to work on the EOWG site -- and I'd be open to lots of feedback from the group. 
Carol For W3C pages in general there is a feedback address: site-comments@w3.org 
I agree that having the pages look good would be helpful, and having consistency and good navigation are an important part of combining that with accessibility. 
I think that some of what is happening in the EO group is helpful in testing ideas that should be easily applied to the W3C site as a whole, but note that there are further design constraints on the site as a whole that would need to be dealt with on a wider level.
