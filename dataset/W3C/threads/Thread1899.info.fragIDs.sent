<s> From: Scott Lawrence[SMTP:lawrence@agranat.com] Sent: Tuesday, January 20, 1998 11:41 AM Subject: Re: First reactions to mandatory draft PL Numeric perfixes aren't to allow multiple instances of the _same_ extension PL in one message -- they are to guard against the possibility (to use your PL example) that two independent parties design an extension, and both call it PL "Skidoo" (but they will have different URLs for the extension, of course), PL and still allow both to be used in one request.  </s>
<s> I think that having different URLs to identify the extentions is sufficient; if the extentions are so incompatible that they cannot be used in the same header syntax unambiguously, then they shouldn't be implemented in the same place anyway.  </s>
<s> What? First, if two groups invented the extension independently, there will almost certainly be _no_ relation between them.  </s>
<s> Second, if there's just a URL, how can you tell which headers go with that URL?  </s>
<s> I don't want to have to (won't) implement a parser that can deal with: GET /xyz HTTP/1.1 Host: foobar 23-Skidoo: abc 65-Skidoo: def Man: "http://screwball.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> ns=23-, "http://nutcase.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> ns=65- by having to backtrack my parser to remove the 23- and recognize the 'Skidoo'; by the time I get to the Man header, I've seen the two numeric prefix headers and discarded them as unrecognized (and therefor automatically optional) headers.  </s>
<s> This is independent of the use of numerical prefixes.  </s>
<s> I always thought it was obvious that the Man header was required to come _ahead_ of any uses -- but I can't recall if the spec _says_ that.  </s>
<s> Even supposing hypothetically that we did do this, what happens to the headers now - granted we separated them for transmission, but internally the values will be combined anyway as though they were sent as Skidoo: abc, def because that is what header folding rules say we should be able to do.  </s>
<s> 23-Skidoo and 65-SKidoo are _not_ the same header, so they shouldn't be folded.  </s>
<s> We're close to having a registry for header field names anyway; I just don't think that this extra complexity is warranted.  </s>
<s> It seems that at least some of the complexity is due to a misconception.  </s>

<s> Second, PL if there's just a URL, how can you tell which headers go with that PL URL?  </s>
<s> If I don't understand the extention it doesn't matter whether or not I know what headers go with it - I return an error anyway.  </s>
<s> That is my point, and I'll restate it as a question: Is the goal of the draft to specify how to require the use of a particular extention, or is it to specify how to do dynamically loaded extentions?  </s>
<s> The former is important, the latter is an interesting academic exercise.  </s>
<s> PL I always thought it was obvious that the Man header was required PL to come _ahead_ of any uses -- but I can't recall if the spec PL _says_ that.  </s>
<s> I didn't see it, but even if it did I don't think that there is any requirement that proxies preserve header field order so you can't count on it.  </s>
<s> PL 23-Skidoo and 65-SKidoo are _not_ the same header, so they shouldn't be PL folded.  </s>
<s> They are for CGI purposes after the prefixes have been removed (or are we going to require that CGIs also understand prefixes?).  </s>

<s> This causes a problem _if_ an application _thinks_ it knows a header field but this header field in fact has been used by another extension with completely different semantics.  </s>
<s> This is an unavoidable problem when multiple extensions share a single, global header field space and no central registry can hinder this.  </s>
<s> The alternative is to pass all extension information as parameters: M-GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: foobar Man: "http://screwball.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> Skidoo=abc, "http://nutcase.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> Skidoo=def which avoids the problem altogether.  </s>
<s> The spec already says that all unknown  </s>
<s> parameters should be passed to the extension.  </s>
<s> It is to allow multiple extensions to coexist in a distributed environment without knowing about each other.  </s>
<s> How an application gets to know about the semantics of an extension is entirely up to the application - downloading a module is only one way.  </s>
<s> There is no reason why prefixes should ever have to be passed outside the Mandatory extension mechanism.  </s>
<s> If the CGI script gets the header fields through the Mandatory filter then this can easily strip off the prefixes.  </s>

<s> Dynamically allocating collision-free headers is so difficult that is is not worth the trouble (see my comments on an earlier PEP draft for a discussion).  </s>
<s> Why add a complicated indirection layer if you do not need one?  </s>
<s> If people really want headers, the draft can tell them to register them in the upcoming IANA header registry.  </s>
