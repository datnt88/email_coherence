WEB SITE DESIGN FOR THE BLIND There are a steadily growing number of the half-million blind people nationwide who regularly use computers for work, education and pleasure, and technological breakthroughs are occurring almost daily in text-to-voice scanners, Braille printers and specially designed software to help overcome the barriers of icons and other graphics of the visually oriented World Wide Web. 
Recently, Blind Industries and Services of Maryland in Baltimore opened a fully accessible site-including graphics-that contains information for both blind and sighted people -- http://www.bism.com/ . 
The site was specifically designed to include graphics: "We didn't want just a plain boring screen because sighted people use the site as well." 
Creating the graphics-friendly site required "a lot of major revisions" of conventional Internet design concepts.

The site is not bad in Lynx (Image maps are still a mess - the answer seems to be to use seperate images, each as a link. 
In this particular case it would be a big improvement) In 24pt Font the standard graphics version is still pretty messy though. 
And why put a text only link at the bottom instead of the top? 
A good start, but clearly a long way to go.

there are a couple of images with no alt text in them and I'd suggest a presentation page with a choice of text or graphical/universal pages rather than embedding the choice within the page that may not be accessable to older browsers. 
I was also disappointed not to readily find a mailto for feedback on the site.
