<s> Erik,  </s>
<s> There is a market for pixel based fonts within memory constrained devices, however.....  </s>
<s> For collaborative documents the world went with scalable type already for products like Envoy and Acrobat.  </s>
<s> The web already makes use of scalable fonts by referencing the FONT-FACE= tag like in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.  </s>
<s> I is almost impossible to move towards bitmaps again.  </s>

<s> Actually, the pixelfont document has been extended a bit.  </s>
<s> Not since I made my comments.  </s>
<s> I see from your document: Last Modified: Thursday, 08-Aug-96 01:13:12 GMT The main substance of the argument seems to be not that pixelfonts are good, but that outline fonts on the Web are bad.  </s>
<s> You seem to take the position that outline fonts should only be used by phototypesetting bureaux, everyone else should use bitmaps to ensure that they don't copy outline fonts.  </s>
<s> So you don't much care to define what pixelfonts might mean or how they might be used, just that people shouldn't use outline fonts on the Web.  </s>
<s> Would that be a fair summary?  </s>

<s> Sorry if people have already received this.  </s>
<s> I got a rather garbled mail-bounce message and couldn't figure out which of the original three recipients hadn't received it.  </s>
<s> A move towards bitmaps certainly seems unlikely (although LettError have certainly made a good showing of the clever, creative things you can do with pixel fonts that you can't do with scaleable outlines -- I suspect there is a market for such fonts and associated tools, as they present web and multimedia designers with a decidedly playful way of dealing with display text).  </s>
<s> I, however, fully support Erik's criticism of font embedding developments to date.  </s>
<s> As professional type designers, neither Erik nor I are keen on seeing our fonts being shot around the world in a variety of insecure document formats (of which Acrobat is definitely an example).  </s>
<s> The current FONT-FACE= tag is not a problem, as it relies on the font in question being present on the end-user's system.  </s>
<s> Systems which conspire to put that font on the end-user's system so they can view and print a given website or electronic document are a problem, and a represent a serious threat to type designers' livelihoods.  </s>
<s> My own idea for a solution is to give designers and foundries greater control over the ways in which their fonts can be used (i.e. control within font format technology), and modify existing payment and distribution models to reflect that control.  </s>
<s> Designers who intend their fonts to be used primarily for print media applications should be able to disable the font in such a way that it cannot be used in electronic documents; they then take their chances in the traditional graphic design and typography market.  </s>
<s> Designers who want to make their typefaces available for web design and other electronic applications should be subsidised by the software and Internet developers whose products are made more valuable by the existence of such fonts.  </s>
<s> Matthew Carter's Verdana is an excellent example of the latter: Microsoft paid Matthew to design the typeface and Tom Rickner to hint it, then give it away free.  </s>
<s> Obviously they see this as a good investment, as it increases the value of, among other things, their Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> If software developers want to create tools which make it possible to send embedded fonts all over the world, they should be the one's paying for font development.  </s>
