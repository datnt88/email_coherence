WL:: How many similar instances are proposed? 
Enough to warrant yet another document? 
Or perhaps a major expansion of the Introduction? 
Need guidelines serve as be-all/end-all exemplars of completeness or can we assume some participation from the audience? 
I think the examples given are cogent and well-chosen and have a place but the question of where? 
persisits. 
Again who's the audience? 
What do they already know (and when did they know it?)? Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I think that the principles given are the complete set, although I have a nagging feeling I forgot one. 
So I am expecting at most one more similar instance. 
I expect some participation from the audience - people who write applications are not fools, although by and large they have never run across accessibility (any more than the people we cite in the 'explain accessibility in help files' checkpoint). 
I think what we are striving for is a document which can be read and give somebody a terse but accurate explanation of what needs to be done. 
I think we should also outline some strategies which could be used, but I would prefer them to be in a separate techniques document.
