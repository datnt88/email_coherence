Wendy and Gregg were the only people who commented on waicard10. 
The printers have to have it finalized by Thursday morning Feb 11. 
Here's where we are: 1) I've copied Wendy Chisholm's message below. 
Please look at Wendy's image map comment. 
I think her comment has been accounted for in our discussions, but if others agree it should be changed to read "Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots," please let me know, &amp; that's what we'll do. 
2) Also please look at Wendy's image &amp; animations comment. 
This gets back to the awkwardness of "function," however I am not sure that her proposed alternatives "replaces" or "provides" don't invite other kinds of confusion. 
So, unless there is agreement from the list on either of these alternatives, we will leave as is. 
3) Page organization. 
I thought our last version had "where possible" after "Use CSS for layout and style." 
I cannot find the reference on EOWG list for dropping the "where possible" following CSS. 
While I do feel strongly that we should mention CSS here, I also feel that the caution is necessary. 
I will add "where possible" back in unless someone clarifies a resounding reason to leave those two words out. 
4) "For Complete..." Gregg Vanderheiden has expressed additional concern about people thinking that the Quick Tips are the final say in Web accessibility, based on his observations of how people respond to the pilot version when visitors come in to Trace. 
He requested that we move the URL back to the bottom of the back and label it "For the rest of the guidelines and checkpoints..." However given our discussions about people never noticing the URL at the bottom of the back, and based on space constraints, I have recommended the following, which the designer has been able to fit in nicely: "FOR COMPLETE GUIDELINES &amp; CHECKLIST; WWW.W3.ORG/WAI" 
This is in caps, set in an inverted band below the title &amp; logos. 
Looks good; stands out well; should entice people with the thought of a handy checklist. 
5) Gregg also raised a concern that the second phrase of "multimedia" doesn't make any sense ("provide... accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used). 
I am not sure what we can do to clarify this, nor what we lose if we take this out, since this does not clearly enough address the pdf-type file format issue which has come up repeatedly &amp; was sometimes mentioned in conjunction with this. 
If there are no additional comments, I will leave as is. 
If someone can propose a simple &amp; non-controversial clarification without adding more than three additonal words, kindly do so. 
5) Making sure people turn the card over: We're adding an arrow in lower right of front side, and printing the conference literature stuffer with one tear-off card facing front &amp; one facing back.

Subject: feedback I think the all of the P1 items as well as "major" P2 items are covered. 
good to see. 
concerns: 1. "Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots." is it saying that *both* client-side image maps with alternative text for each link as well as text links for each hotspot need to be provided on a page? 
If so, I think this has been misinterpretted and that it ought to be recommending that client-side image maps ought to be used and to include alt text for each hotspot in the image map. 
Text links in addition to well-designed client side imaps, is good, but not a highest priority strategy to highlight. 
2. "Images &amp; animations. 
Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals." 
rather than "describing the function" I think that it "replaces" or "provides" the function of the visual. 
by saying "description" you may have people providing too much detail. 
Also, we really need to emphasize the separation of function from presentation. 
otherwise, looks great! 
it's good to see that the whole doc can be boiled down to these 10 points!

One does not use "alt" and thus a more general statement should be made in regards to techniques. 
We're proposing the following for the next version of the guidelines: For all image map links, provide text for each link (e.g., via the "alt" attribute of HTML AREA elements or by using the MAP element with anchors defined with the A element). 
we're still working on the wording, but I hope the message is clear. 
thanks, --wendy with alt in bold or not ? 
putting it in bold clearly points at the attribute (used in AREA) and leave out both the inline alt text (that Len wanted to have expressed) and the new MAP content model with text in A (that wendy mentioned). 
I suggest we use this sentence with alt not in bold. 
Agreed. 
my mistake probably, we had "wherever possible" and it was never my intent to remove it. is that a ; or a : ? 
I would prefer a : I guess it's too much asking to see a image of the preprint ? 
how about re-adding "non-W3C inaccessible" ? 
Discussion on image map item follows. 
Statement on waicard10 currently reads: "Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots." 
Even if we know what we mean in real life, the challenge with the reference card is to get this into an absolute minimum of words, as a conceptual prompt, with the expectation that people will refer back to the guidelines for additional information. 
We can't use a general statement as long as the one above. 
Do you have a (short) proposal, or a reaction to Daniel's proposal? 
Here are Daniel's comments from this morning: and Replacement proposal is "Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots." 
Are we missing an obvious other approach? 
Is either version a "show-stopper"?

How about the following: Use client-side MAP and provide text for each hotspot. 
too cryptic? 
--wendy Latest summary of comments: Note another comment we have received from Michael Muller of Lotus: Item currently reads "Frames. 
Label with title or name attribute." 
We have a space constraint here, but could do this: "Frames. 
Label with unique title or name attribute." 
Reactions? 
I will use this unless disagreement. 
1.) image map comment... Here is the latest proposal from Wendy: reads: This is actually what the card already said... document. 
Yes I think this risks being misunderstood; I could image someone putting bit-mapped text on the hot-spots and not realizing it is a problem. 
Will leave as is. 
Will add back in, but as "where possible" due to space. 
checklist. 
Supposed to be ":" Yes, sorry given time constraints, but I've copied the latest version in text below. 
So then "Multimedia" would read: "Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions in case non-W3C inaccessible formats are used." 
Does this automatically equate non-W3C formats with inaccessible formats? 
Is that always a valid statement? 
Also, Gregg, can you re-state what was confusing about the "accessible versions of inaccessible formats"? 
In your view is this (a) incomprehensible; or (b) incorrect? 
And do you have a (short) proposal of how to fix? 
Without further proposal, I will leave as is. 
LATEST CARD CURRENTLY READS: Quick tips to make accessible Web sites For complete guidelines &amp; checklist: www.w3.org/WAI - Images &amp; animations. 
Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals.

- Multimedia. 
Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used. 
[OR: some change in last phrase?] 
- Hypertext links. 
Use text that makes sense when read out of context. 
For instance, do not use "click here." - Page organization. 
Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. 
Use CSS for layout and style where possible. 
- Graphs &amp; charts. 
Summarize or use the longdesc attribute. 
- Scripts, applets, &amp; plug-ins. 
Provide alternative content in case active features are inaccessible or unsupported. 
- Frames. 
Label with unique title or name attribute. 
- Tables. 
Make line by line reading sensible.

Avoid using tables for column layout. 
- Check your work. 
Validate the HTML. 
Use evaluation tools and text-only browsers to verify accessibility.

Keep the leadin for consistency: Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP with alt text for each hotspot. 
Regards/Harvey Yes but Wendy's previous comment indicated that "alt" wasn't complete either: I don't think she was suggesting dropping the lead-in of "Image maps." 
How about absolutely simplest: "Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text for each hotspot." 
OK? 
They can get the detail from the "complete guidelines &amp; checklist" as advertised.

If I was printing the card, that is what I would put. 
But I am not really fussed about it.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Re what to say about image maps. 
We have 1. Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots. 
two proposed changes are 2a "Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots. 
[alt not bold] 2b "Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots. 
[alt bold] another alternative is 3. "Use client-side MAP and alternative text for hotspots. 
Although ALT text alone is optimal for some circumstances, I wouldn't be able in good conscience to recommend all sites I work with to rely on ALT text alone, given e.g. the MSIE/JAWS problems I heard about when I asked people to look at the test page concerned with government sites that must accommodate the widest range of users. 
I've been persuaded (arguments by Charles and Daniel mostly) that given our limited space the best answer is deliberate ambiguity that doesn't swing too much one way or the other. 
I'd suggest #3 ("alternative text"). 
My second choice would #2b (alt text with alt not in bold). 
My discomfort level rises with 2a (alt text with alt in bold) because then I'm faced with convincing people to put in the redundant text links even tho it's not on the card. 
As for the current wording, #1, (text links) hmmm... on a practical level that's fine with me because it gets the job done, but I'm sympathetic with concerns that it downplays ALT text which is in principle the superior solution, at least when we can be sure that all the users have browser/screenreaders that can handle it. 
On another point... 
I don't think we should go back to "non-W3C inaccessible" ? 
This could make someone think: So I need to provide alternative when the inaccessible material is non-W3C but don't need to provide alternative when the inaccessible material is W3C? 
Even if there's no inaccessible W3C material I think this is confusing Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Universal Design Engineer, Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Adjunct Professor, Electrical Engineering Temple University Ritter Hall Annex, Room 423, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org 
(215} 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) I like that one. 
It is a bit ambiguous, but as I mentioned before (and as Daniel and Charles recommended) that amgiguity is an advantage because if I use it with someone I'm working with I can interpret it as AREA/ALT alone or redundantly with separate text links, depending on what kind of browser/screenreaders we can expect users to have.
