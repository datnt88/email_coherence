I asked a colleague who teaches Hebrew in our Oriental and African Languages department here about the issue of contracted words in Hebrew, with reference to the use of diacritics. 
She said the idea that these could be described as contractions was "a very strange idea. 
Diacritics represent vowels. 
When we choose not to include them, this is a matter of orthographic preference, but the pronunciation does not change a bit-- we just know what vowel to put in for the correct pronunciation of the word. 
In other words, if my word is y?led, with the two "e" representing vowels (diacritics in Hebrew), without diacritics it will look like yld, but I will still pronounce it as y?led, that is, no contraction has taken place (not even, technically, space wise, as the diacritics appear above or below the consonant letters, and their removal does not change the physical length of the word). 
So unless I do not understand the idea, it is incorrect.? 
Perhaps I asked her the wrong question-- did anyone have something else in mind in discussing contractions in Hebrew?

The intent in this patently ridiculous guideline is to force authors to write kiddie Hebrew and Arabic (and Urdu, Pashto, Dari, and the like, possibly even Yiddish, a more unusual case) with vowels always in place. 
That isn't how we write the adult forms of those languages.

Actually, you appear to have missed both the problem and suggested solution. 
I think you are referring to older discussions. 
The problem was ambiguous words. 
Where, by leaving out vowels and marks 
you ended up with written contractions that could stand for any of several different words. 
(not words that have different but unique ways of being written). 
The solution under discussion was just to ensure that there was some means for disambiguating. 
It did not specify how. 
If this can be done automatically, then there may be no requirement that this be done at all by the author. 
Thus there would be no requirement to write in "Kiddie" 
language - or even to provide any markup. 
But we are still exploring this - hence the conversations. 
By the way - this is also a problem with Chinese and some Japanese writing systems. 
Thus it is one that we were asked to consider and think of ways to address. 
What will end up in the final guidelines -- we do not know yet. 
But we are not taking problems off the table. 
Nor making any judgments about what the 
solutions strategies will be -- and what we would leave in as suggestions for the various levels. 
If you have ideas for addressing things or observations that are not already in Bugzilla (and therefore open issues - not forgotten issues or comments) 
please contribute. 
But please don't tell people to be quiet. 
(and do give some latitude for people to make mistakes or plow old ground. 
It happens.

The problem is not something the author of *Web content* can solve. 
If it is any kind of accessibility issue whatsoever, it is one of user agents, viz. 
screen readers. 
Don't put a requirement in place that could later be held against an author even if that is not the intent at origination. 
It isn't the author's problem that the language in which he or she writes has homographs and polysemy. 
It isn't a problem. 
How this came to be discussed at all is that an Approved Person mentioned it, and, true to form, the Working Group simply reacted with "Great idea! 
Let's tweak a few details and rush it right through!" 
It never should have been raised, let alone discussed. 
I intend to continue to tell people to drop patently ridiculous, erroneous, and irrelevant suggestions. 
Approved Persons have such latitude in unlimited quantity. 
The Working Group will endlessly debate one asinine proposition after another even after being told it's asinine. 
Merely as an example, five years after WCAG 1.0, you're still obsessing about acronyms and abbreviations (of which the original discussion in this context is merely a variant). 
Do we not have more important things to do for WCAG 2.0? 
So no, if the Working Group keeps barking up the wrong tree, I won't refrain from pointing the dog at another tree.

Gregg,If disambiguation is the problem we're trying to solve, that's fine. 
But it won't helpsolve that problem if we describe it incorrectly, and the term "contracted words" is not an accurate term for Hebrew words in which vowels are indicated by diacritical marks. 
Contractions in English, such as "isn't," "It's," and so forth, are formed when *two* words are joined together and some of the letters are delted and replaced with an apostrophe. 
That's not the ame thing at all as the case of single words in languages that use diacritics to indicate vowels, etc.

Regarding contractions discussion. 
Arghh This is where the process sometimes seems to get in the way. 
But we still need to follow process.... 
The words that we currently have in the guidelines - are not necessarily the ones we want there in the long run -- or even our current thinking. 
You have to read the guidelines -- and then read all of the issues and comments in bugzilla that relate to it. 
Reacting to a single post on the list by saying that the whole topic is cow droppings only creates confusion and heat -- not light. 
When I made my comments recently I was responding to the whole discussion of disambiguation -- which is what we are currently looking at. 
Abbvs. 
Contractions, etc are part of a larger problem that includes jargon and other words that the user cannot figure out. 
That is where the discussion is. 
This is an area that is a 'usability' problem for all - (which we do NOT attend to in our guidelines) but also an accessibility problem for people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities. 
(also screen readers and artificial agents of all types.) If the meaning can be derived from context automatically (and I believe it can in most cases for Hebrew by the way) then nothing should be required of the author. 
That is my view -- but we haven't gotten to this issue so I don't know where the group is on it yet. 
And neither does anyone else on this list. 
So to say that "the group this" or "the group that" because of either a single posting or even the current status of the wording of the guidelines -- only shows that one doesn't understand the process. 
When we come out with 'consensus' statements -- then one can comment. 
And the best way to comment is to make a suggestion for how to address the issue that the item was focused at. 
Often the group reaches consensus on a particular wording only because it cannot find another - and this is better than what we have. 
We often have to go through several of these before we get it right. 
Good suggestions are always welcome. 
And we also periodically take grand looks at the scope etc of the guidelines to see where we are. 
And we look at structure and what is in or out, and what are things that we thing people really should do and what things are included for those who want to go the extra mile. 
And these should not be confused either.

Correct. What we essentially want, I think, is that every word in the document be unambiguously identifiable so that it can be looked up in a dictionary, pronounced by a text to speech system, or otherwise processed. 
As Gregg mentioned, this may demand nothing of the author; 
but where the orthography is ambiguous, and there is no reliable automated means of disambiguating it, authorial intervention is needed to solve the underlying problem. 
This point, incidentally, generalizes to all of our guidelines at level 1: the author need only supply that information which tools need in order to adapt the content and thereby make it more accessible to the user. 
Another way of making this point is that WCAG is the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines", not the "what the author has to do" guidelines. 
Many of the requirements are destined to be implemented by software, particularly authoring tools; but they can equally well be met by the author directly in the case of "hand-coded" content, or where the author is using an editor that offers a high degree of control over the eventual coding. 
What the guidelines become, in practice, via the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, is a series of prompts, options, warnings, error messages and so on, in an authoring system. 
Gregg, thanks for this account of our process. 
My original post about "contracted words in Hebrew" was sent in response to something that occurred during last week's teleconference. 
A participant took an ation item to write a definition of "contracted words," and there was a specific request that the definition take account of such words in Hebrew. 
My personal memories of Hebrew school were hardly sufficient basis for arguing that trying to write a definition like that would get us into trouble, so I asked a colleague who is a Hebrew scholar and a native speaker for information and passed her reply on to the list. 
I should have taken more care to explain the context of my message, and I apologize for not having done so.

Our esteemed colleague is engaging in the habits, exhibited by Participants in Good Standing and Approved Persons, of ignoring persuasive contrary evidence and reiterating the original falsehoods (as we saw in colourblindness). 
That simply *is not* a characteristic of written languages. 
English and Hebrew (the two languages most discussed in this thread) have many homographic or polysemic words that must be understood in their proper context and meaning by the human reader. 
That is the way the languages work; reading requires audience participation. 
That was true before WCAG 1.0 was ratified, it's true now, and it will be true long after everyone participating in this thread is dead. 
And it's *not an accessibility problem* for authors. 
Every attempt by the Working Group to clarify the intention merely restates the same requirement: Write Hebrew with nikud and make every ambiguous English word unambiguous. 
That horse won't hunt. 
If your screen reader stumbles on English homographs or Hebrew words, get a better screen reader. 
If you're dyslexic and have trouble reading homographs or Hebrew, lean on your adaptive technology, not the author. 
If you have trouble with *genuine* abbreviations and acronyms, expect the author *and* the adaptive technology to share the burden. 
But that example is qualitatively different. 
It is a much simpler task for adaptive-technology makers to improve their exception dictionaries and other lexicons than to force *every author in the world who wants to meet WCAG* to write in a way found nowhere else at all. 
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has no authority to force authors to write in some Bizarro-world manner in which no word is ambiguous. 
Words are sometimes ambiguous; accept it. 
The Working Group continues to show magnificent stubbornness and ignorance in dealing with this question. 
*It's a non-starter* (hear this well, Gregg). 
*We don't have to endlessly debate stupid ideas*, particularly when the Working Group simply ignores contravening facts. 
You'll chatter along all day about something without a basis in fact, but when someone-- like me-- points to clear and unambiguous data, you ignore it. 
Gregg makes this request: "[T]he best way to comment is to make a suggestion for how to address the issue that the item was focused at." 
The way to address the issue in question is to be grown-up enough to admit its proponents were wrong in the first place and *it isn't an issue*.
