Regarding the xml:lang, I don't think it is a bug. 
I always thought that it would be a characteristic of the string (the literal value), and since M+S did not really address primitive data types, it wouldn't have to be concerned of xml:lang either. 
How do we propose adding it? 
As a qualification of the actual property value?

It is good to give credit where credit is due for issued, and not always jut to point to the director as well! 
- XML lang not being in the model was brought up by Sergey Thoiugh that suggests adding itto the model rather than removing it from th esyntax. 
Folks,xml:lang is not represented in the RDF model according to RDF M&amp;S 1.0, which is IMO a bug in the specs. 
- The issue of Alt, Bag and Seq being searated out from the basic model is brought up in example. 
- Issue: need for "poorest man" serializeion As a next step I'd like to have a "poorest man" RDF/XML serialization: rdf These may not be the first occurrences. 
But I think all the issued I pulled out I pulled out of previous messages. 
pointers to the first raising we can find would be a godo idea. 
As regards state, I think we can do a broader categorization. 
- Bug fix, propose for 1.1 (ml lang, some reference issues?) - Simplification (like removing PICS bits, aabouteachprefix, lang, etc). 
Doesn't affect other features = wait to see if IG wanst tto start an action to do them - Syntax change which can be done back-compatibly with existing syntax = suggest trials with software. 
Or something like that. 
Then we concldue, there are only 2 bugs and there is a consensus for a version 1.5, but we need to work on x and y at teh IG level. 
O If not a bug, a glitch. 
If you're saying that xml:lang values are similiar to datatypes, I agree. 
Some literal may have a type (eg. 
foo:floatPoint) and/or an xml:lang. 
This does clash with the model's insistence that literals can't have properties though... dan I think strings with lang specifications should be treated just like we should treat something like 5kg. 
i.e., 5kg=11lb just as Welcome(english)=Wilkommen(german).

- The issue of Alt, Bag and Seq being searated out from the basic model i s brought up in r It was the I18N Working Group who pressured us into not exposing xml:lang in the RDF graph. 
"RDF Model and Syntax Open,Deferred,Closed Issues" C.8. Support for language tagging (xml:lang) -closed in 19980111; See also "Internationalization Review of RDF M&amp;S" #xmllang But sw99 is not the best place to be discussing the details of any of these issues (even though it's at least publicly archived so we can cite pertinent messages elsewhere). 
I'd actually like to see more structure inside text exposed to the RDF model. 
E.g. I'd like text to have a content-type so I could know that it was supposed to be application/xml or ... I'd also use this to handle units of measure in a nicer way; e.g. the literals ("1",inch) and ("1",USDollar) are distinct and have RDF-visible properties. 
-Ralph ml#xmllang OK, let's move this to the RDF IG list please! 
Ralph -- see you on www-rdf-interest :-) Could we shadow literals with anonymous resources that bear their properties somehow? 
(thinking somewhat out loud) Is this a model, API, query langauge, web architecture question?
