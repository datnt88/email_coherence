The W3C link validator reported on the current doc at the following broken links to the issues list: What to do: There are broken fragments which must be fixed. 
HTTP Code returned: 200 HTTP Message: OK Lines: 1365, 1366, 1373, 1378, 1380, 2581, 2582 Broken fragments and their line numbers: They need to be fixed! 
rdfms-syntax-incomplete: 1378 rdfms-aboutEach-on-object: 2581 rdfms-seq-representation: 1373 These seem to have disappeared since the last publication of the WDs; the text in the issues list has no anchors for the issues anymore. 
For example: h3 Issue rdfms-syntax-incomplete: The RDF/XML syntax can't represent an an arbritary graph structure. 
/h3 -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/ Dave This keeps happening - I don't know why - something is dropping frag anchors from the doc - Amaya? 
I will fix these today.

But the anchors are fixed.
