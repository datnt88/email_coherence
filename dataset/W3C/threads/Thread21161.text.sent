Hi, Bug 1 Amaya displays strange colors when the name of the colors in the CSS file begins with light-, medium- or pale-. 
For example: h1 { background-color: light-yellow; } p { background-color: light-blue; } Bug 2 (not so sure) Amaya displays "grey" color like "gray" and "lightgray" color like "lightgrey" but the correct names are only "gray" and "lightgrey", aren't they? 
"grey" and "lightgray" values are shown by Amaya and Mozilla, but are not shown by Internet Explorer. 
Suggestion 1 If incorrect names are written in a style attribute (for example, background-color: foofoo;), a warning message (Invalid color value "foofoo") is shown in the parsing error view. 
But this message is displayed only the first time the attribute is set. 
If the document is saved and reopened, the message is not displayed. 
Could the parsing that detects the error be included in every opening or saving of a XHTML document (or a CSS file)? 
Best regards, Bartolome Sintes Marco (htttp://www.mclibre.org) 
Bug fixed. 
Those names are now considered as invalid color names. 
They are. 
These colors are accepted by Amaya. 
Not sure they should be removed... OK. Amaya behaves the way you suggest now. 
Thanks for your comments.

In article 20030211170958.C1F943DFD@lihue.inrialpes.fr , The colour names 'grey and 'lightgrey' are standard English spelling - however US spelling differs, writing 'gray' for 'grey'. 
In order to cater for both forms of English, both spellings are accepted (as I would say 'unfortunately' - but then, being English, I'm biased!). 
City Desk Waikato University [PGP key available if desired] I don't want to start a language war on this but I do like to put my 2 cents in: In the X11/Unix environment, both US-english and UK-english are defined as selectable languages. 
They both clearly use their own gray or grey. 
The default language is 'C', after the programming language. 
It's a kind of international-english. 
If this is the language mode (or there is no language specified at all) all spellings are correct and one of them is used (randomly?) 
For amaya, I would say to do the same (or something similar). 
If the language mode is US-english or similar, then use US-English in the keywords (gray etc.). 
If the langueage mode is UK-english or similar (like other english variants from the Commonwealth) use UK-english for the keywords (grey etc.). 
As a European (I'm Dutch), I vote for UK-english for the default to use if the above selection is not applicable. 
If the language is clearly set to one of the english variants, the already available keywords can be 'translated' too if other keywords are also optimized (or was is optimised ;-)? 
As for the subject, It's not a bug, gray and grey are both aliasses to color '190 190 190'. 
See the 'rgb.txt' 
file on your unix system. 
CBee Hi, The problem with color names is not a problem of spelling, but a problem of following W3C recommendations. 
The W3C CSS validator (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) reports (for a CSS 2 profile check): Invalid number : background-colorgrey is not a color value : grey Invalid number : background-colorlightgray is not a color value : lightgray I think Amaya (a W3C software) should not display a color that the W3C validator rejects. 
If these names are accepted in future recommendations, Amaya should support them. 
But the CSS3:color module working draft does not include "grey" or "lightgray".

Hi, The last CSS3 color module working draft (http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-color-20030214/) includes gray/gey variants. 
Perhaps Amaya already supports these variants because they are included in SVG 1.0. 
(The question that remains is "will MS Internet Explorer ever support it?", but that is another problem :-) In any case, I see potential problems in the availability of various CSS levels (1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, etc). 
It would be great if I could tell Amaya which level I want to use (in a new Special  Preferences  CSS menu) and then Amaya would check my CSS file against it. 
Perhaps the W3C CSS validator could be included in Amaya. 
Best regards.
