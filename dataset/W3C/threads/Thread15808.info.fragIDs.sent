<s> Hi everyone.  </s>
<s> I have only one accessiblity problem with my web sites.  </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone knew how I could correct it.  </s>
<s> I use Pagecount counter and it will be not approved by Bobby cause it needs to be formatted into a client-side image map.  </s>
<s> I have tried to do this and I even have the nice people at Pagecount working on it, but they are not sure how to do it either.  </s>
<s> **Smile** Does anyone know how to do this and let me know?  </s>
<s> I would be most appreciative.  </s>

<s> Hey folks.  </s>
<s> Remember that Bobby is not perfect, but an attempt to automatically check your code.  </s>
<s> For that matter the guidelines are probably not perfect either.  </s>
<s> The difficulty here is that Bobby has in the past given 4 stars to inaccessible websites, and only one to very accessible ones.  </s>
<s> These things need to be tempered with a bit of old-fashioned rainpower to work as well as possible.  </s>
<s> I had a look at Richard's deafwatch front page ( http://www.deafwatch.com/ ), and thought that it was not too bad.  </s>
<s> Improvements could be made by removing MARQUEE as it is not an HTML element, giving IMAGES titles and longdesc/D-links as well as ALT text (more work, but hopefully it can be partially automated.  </s>
<s> My _personal_ feeling is that LONGDESC and a D-link should both be used, pointing to the same thing, that TITLE should provide the functional description of a resource and that ALT should attempt to capture whatever is most important in a few succinct words) and by using style sheets instead of hard-formatted styles.  </s>
<s> But so far as I can see there is nothing actually inaccessible about the page as it stands.  </s>

<s> I'm not clear what you are asking for.  </s>
<s> The guidelines do include an example of client-side image maps: IMG src="welcome.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="Image map of areas in the library" usemap="#map1" AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html"  </s>
<s> alt="Reference" AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html"  </s>
<s> alt="Audio Visual lab" The idea is simple.  </s>
<s> The img alt attribute is used to name the text menu, with each entry labelled by the alt attribute for each area element.  </s>
<s> A further point is to keep the alt text to 12 characters or shorter.  </s>
<s> This will be important for access by cell phones and devices with small displays.  </s>
