<s> DB: Send proposal for single key access wording for checkpoint 10.3  </s>
<s> Here's the new wording, with two asterisks marking the start and end of proposed new text.  </s>
<s> Note that for the keyboard, "sequence of single commands" assumes Sticky Keys or similar functionality.  </s>

<s> Allow the user to configure the user agent so that **every** functionality may be activated with a single command (e.g., single key, single voice command, etc.) **or a sequence of single commands**.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For voice-activated browsers, allow the user to modify what voice commands activate functionalities.  </s>
<s> Similarly, allow the user to modify the graphical user agent user interface for quick **and convenient** access to commonly used functionalities (e.g., through **adding, removing and reordering toolbar** buttons).  </s>
