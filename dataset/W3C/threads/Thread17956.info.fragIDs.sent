My action item from 1/13/00 was: 
DB: Send proposal for single key access wording for checkpoint 10.3 
Here's the new wording, with two asterisks marking the start and end of proposed new text. 
Note that for the keyboard, "sequence of single commands" assumes Sticky Keys or similar functionality. 
Proposed: 10.3 Allow the user to change and control wai-useragent.html the input configuration wai-useragent.html . 
Allow the user to configure the user agent so that **every** functionality may be activated with a single command (e.g., single key, single voice command, etc.) **or a sequence of single commands**. 
[Priority 2] For voice-activated browsers, allow the user to modify what voice commands activate functionalities. 
Similarly, allow the user to modify the graphical user agent user interface for quick **and convenient** access to commonly used functionalities (e.g., through **adding, removing and reordering toolbar** buttons).

I've a question about this. 
if my os does not support sticky keys, do I need to do this natively?

David, This seems more of a question for Kiosk type situations, since most major OS do support stickey keys: MS-Windows, Mac OS and X-Windows. 
I think this may be discussed in the techniques document. 
The group decided that it really did not what to directly address Kiosk type technology in these guidelines.
