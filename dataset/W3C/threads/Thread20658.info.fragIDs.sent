<s> I've recently started to experiment with Amaya, and immediately ran into a  </s>
<s> problem with the presentation of Tim's DesignIssues note on Notation 3 (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html): specifically, Amaya doesn't indent the productions after the first of a BNF form (e.g. uri-ref2), which makes the intent _much_ harder to understand.  </s>
<s> For comparison, the display using Netscape (4.7) is fine.  </s>
<s> I don't know if this is a problem with Amaya or the document, so I'm copying this message both ways.  </s>

<s> It works for me.  </s>
<s> Are you using a local copy with no style sheet maybe?  </s>
<s> It should work - I made those pages all with Amaya.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen than phenomenon, so I can' think what might have caused it.  </s>
<s> I do find the background color is different, and the line spacing, but the DL indentation seems to be fine.  </s>

<s> That may be it... living in the boondocks as I do, much of my Internet access is done without benefit of continuous Internet connection ... maybe an accessibility issue?  </s>
