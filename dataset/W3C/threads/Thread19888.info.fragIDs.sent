I have recently been thinking that I would like Amaya to change certain factors of its behaviour when in read-only (browsing) mode. 
For example, following links and pressing buttons could be single-click actions instead of double-clicks. 
The toolbar could also change. 
For example, the save button could be replaced by a "home" button. 
These features would make Amaya more comfortable to use when browsing. 
All of the functionality could of course be activated or deactivated depending upon the user's configuration. 
I think that editing and browsing are close enough so that having two seperate modes adds more to the complexity of use than the rearrangement of commands might save. 
Seperate browsing and editing 
modes may also continually plague people will repeated common mistakes stemming from thinking that they are in the wrong mode, such as trying to select an object and accidentally jumping to it. 
When I use a browser, I sometimes want to have edit-like functionality, such as the ability to copy text from an active area that is going to send me to some place if I try to select the text with the cursor. 
Many web browser that do not edit have "save" and "save as" commands. 
The only purpose of having seperate view and edit modes is to improve the user interface, but since the two modes are so close, I think that the complexity of learning two interfaces more than cancels the simplification achived by optimizing the each mode to these sepaerate but similar activities. 
The analogy to view mode in text editors is misleading, because view mode just disables certain commands rather than rebinding new commands. 
By the way, I too think that Amaya would be much more intuitive to use if a plain single click followed the link, instead of a double click. 
Also, there is the is a semi-political issue here. 
As I 
understand the situation, the Amaya teams wants to focus on doing research on editing, while those of us in the peanut gallery (testers, debuggers, contributors) are motivated by the possibility of Amaya becoming a great web browser. 
Fortunately, most of the infrastructure needed to make a "what you see is what you get" web editor solid and useful is what is improved by people fixing and developing the browser functionality, such as cleaner and faster page layout, improvements to libwww, support for more imbedded media types--i.e., "what you see." So, I think that we in the peanut gallery should try to arrange our contributions so that they improve the editor functionality when they improve the browser functionality. 
Not splitting the user interface into two modes would probably be helpful in this regard. 
I don't claim to have a "vote" on a somebody else's project, 
but here is what I would suggest in the hopes that his idea is helpful: 
o Use shift-click to select a object for editing. 
If I move 
between objects that I am editing, it is pretty deliberate. 
My hands are already at the keyboard. 
This is not the case for browsing. 
So, regular click should follow the link. 
If the object is not a hyperlink, then regular click selects the object, just like shift-click. 
o Instead of having a button that switches between "Home" and "Save" deending on mode, get rid of the "Browse/Edit" button so you can have both "Home" and "Save" buttons if you want them. 
o In the long run, the key bindings should be configurable and and should even be able to call user defined Java functions. 
The built-in button bars should probably someday be replaced by HTML+Java too. 
Then we could have contests for cool button bars. 
:-) Anyhow, I hope these suggestions are helpful.

OK, but make sure it is possible to invoke in a read-only mode. 
As for competing with commercial browsers -- Amaya could aim elsewhere so it would not directly compete, it would be filling a different niche. 
What I mean is that the W3C have a Web Accessibility Initiative so amaya COULD be an example of how browsers can be accessible as well as how they should handle HTML4.0. 
Hmm, now that would be a political decision! 
:-) 
Exactly -- these remarks are meant as constructive suggestions :-) 
that is a nice idea 
I would change it to READ-ONLY mode, or only allow saving to a new file.

You are confusing two different kinds of customization. 
Key and mouse bindings should be separate from whether or not you turn on a read-only mode. 
It goes without saying that you should not have any trouble rebinding mouse clicks or other keys using the `amaya.keyboard' 
file or a front end to that file. 
Bindings are a matter of preference. 
The analogy to view mode in text editors is misleading, because view mode just disables certain commands rather than rebinding new commands. 
I disagree. 
Perhaps we are talking at cross purposes. 
I think a read-only mode should consist of disabling certain commands as you say and, as with view-mode, adding just a few more. 
The change in interface should be minimal. 
When a user wants a truly different user interface, like a different theme in a Window manager such as Enlightenment, then the user should install a different theme.

goes on to say: Also, there is the is a semi-political issue here. 
As I understand the situation, the Amaya teams wants to focus on doing research on editing, ... Yes, I think this is very true. 
... I think that we in the peanut gallery should try to arrange our contributions so that they improve the editor functionality when they improve the browser functionality. 
Not splitting the user interface into two modes would probably be helpful in this regard. 
Again, I think there is somewhat of a confusion among the various meanings of `functionality'. 
Part of the functionality is a question of human factors and the default human-machine interface that has to do with layout, colors, keys, mice, and menus. 
Another part of the functionality has to do with internal mechanisms a user `sees' only through the filter provided by one or other interface. 
Indeed, the Amaya teams are able to test and research editing more easily when they can change interfaces easily and separately from internals. 
For example, adam@yggdrasil.com 
suggests: o Use shift-click to select a object for editing. 
If I move between objects that I am editing, it is pretty deliberate. 
It should be easy for the Amaya teams and for any of the rest of us to try this out. 
(For example, I remember changing `amaya.keyboard' on some earlier version, to provide different keybindings. 
But I don't remember how to change mouse bindings and don't see examples of mouse bindings in the `amaya.keyboard' 
or `amaya.kb' 
files, where I expect to see them.) Indeed, as adam@yggdrasil.com 
concludes: o In the long run, the key bindings should be configurable and and should even be able to call user defined Java functions. 
The built-in button bars should probably someday be replaced by HTML+Java too.

I really wish I had kept my mouth shut now :-) It is unfair to say I was confused. 
What I wanted to say was that _if_ we had an automatic mode switch it would IMHO complement well the entirely unrelated feature addition of mode-dependent key/mouse bindings. 
We are essentially discussing separate feature additions, and as a result beginning to talk at cross-purposes. 
1) Automatic switch from read-only to read-write mode, using criteria outlined by Corne previously. 
I think that this is a good idea. 
However, if we made this feature user-selectable, then there is no reason to debate whether or not Joe User will find it confusing. 
If they do, then they don't need to turn it on. 
If Corne and I are the only two people ever to use this feature, then two people are happier, and nobody else is worse off. 
2) User configurable mouse bindings. 
I believe, as Robert mentioned, that it is currently impossible to alter mouse bindings in a way similar to that used to alter key bindings currently. 
I think this would be a good thing to have. 
3) Mode-dependent key/mouse bindings. 
I would like my bindings to be mode dependent. 
However, this may well add significant complexity to Amaya, and I am not passionately attached to the idea. 
I am willing to drop the whole subject if we are going to get swamped in an evangelical debate about how we all like our window managers configured. 
4) Initial view. 
(Which type of window Amaya starts with). 
This was mentioned by Corne, and should be user-configurable, IMHO.
