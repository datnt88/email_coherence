I've done an updated version of the strawman model theory based on the feedback so far: Let U be the set of absolute URI References (as defined by RFC 2396). 
//ignore lang and namespaces for now Let S be the set of of ISO 10646 strings An interpretation I of STATEMENTS, a set of statements {s1, s2, ... ,sn} where each si is an n-triple statement, consists of: A set R of thingies A subset P of thingies which corresponds to Properties A mapping IN : U - R A mapping IEXT : P - powerset(R x R) // R cross R A mapping IS : S - R Let STATEMENTS be a set {s1, s2, ..., sn} of n-triple statements Let A be the set of names of the form _:name in STATEMENTS STATEMENTS is true in I if and only if there is a substitution mapping SUBST from the members of A to R such that each member of STATEMENTS is true in I under that substition. 
s p o . is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if: s, p, o are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p)) s p "string" . is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if: s and p are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P and string is a member of S (IN(s), IS(string)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p)) _:name p o is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if: p and o are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P and (SUBST(_:name), IN(O)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p)) s _:name o is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if: s and o are members of U, SUBST(_:name) is a member of P and (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(SUBST(_:name)) and similarly for anon nodes in other positions in the n-triple statement. 
No doubt there is a more elegant way of expressing this without lots of repetition. 
Brian I know what this is getting at (and I know why "thingies" is being used), but on the other hand, you've got to admit the humor in a bare reading of this, which suggests we're going to clarify the semantics of RDF by mapping its concepts to "thingies" (or groupings of them). 
I thought before that "resource" was a little vague. 
I'm glad we're clearing that up! 
:-) --Frank PS: An OMG committee many years ago used "frogs" for very much the same reasons.

| i'm working to make it happen I think we better reserve deeleys for when we need to clarify thingies. 
Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 How about gensym:0101293485832346509234589a098? 
Brian Kind of unpronouncable isn't it? 
Also, isn't that only when we want to refer to existentially quantified variables? 
(Oops! 
Wrong thread!) Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 My take on the current definition of predicate in: is that it does does not allow a predicate to be a annon node. 
Is the intent to change this in the model theory? 
Art Whoa! where did that come from? 
Please change that back to triple ::= term ws+ term ws+ term ws* '.' ws* term ::= uriref | namedNode | literal I expect the model theory to cover the case of any sort of term used in any of the three places. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Seems like it would be a rather significant change to: if subjects and predicates could be literals. 
Art The revised MT allows this, but if the syntax excludes it, the model theory will not complain. 
However, it does suggest that there is no pressing need to exclude it, at least on semantic grounds.

The only case the straw-dog doesnt cover right now is the use of a literal as a predicate. 
This would be OK if the EXT mapping were extended to the set LV of literal values, but I didnt know if that was considered legitimate. 
If people are happy with this, it's easy to make the modification. 
I await input. 
Pat PS. 
It also easy to have only some literal values be predicatable, as long as we can characterize the relevant subset.
