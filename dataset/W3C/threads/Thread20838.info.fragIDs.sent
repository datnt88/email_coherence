Now using hr element as separator ... works as i expected in msie but not in other browsers . 
1] is the hr element allowed within an address element the mozilla.org 
groups contend that it cant be nested that way but validator does not complain. 
2] the short test that i am adding does not do a line return before the paragraph after hr element in address... is this a bug ??? 3 there are two lines (only spotted this when i made a darker shade background ... top line is correct.... where does bottom one come from?? my assumption is that amaya sets different height than other browsers do on the hr element . 
test case is as follows body {background:#d6e0cc} hr {color:khaki; margin:0px; padding:0px} hr.s {width:20px} Here is a test of the hr tag br Resume normal programming now. 
Why the double line and isn't hr a block element where it should start a new line John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA check HTML at http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ 
check CSS at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ check JavaScript at http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jslint.html 
According to the HTML DTD http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html 
HR is a block element, and not an inline element. 
Block elements are not allowed inside P, so I would say the Mozilla people are reading the spec correctly.

Oh, same goes for address by the way. 
So it shouldn't allow p or hr elements inside it either.
