"2.4 Predicates An axis is either a forward axis or a reverse axis. 
An axis that only ever contains the context node or nodes that are after the context node in document order is a forward axis. 
An axis that only ever contains the context node or nodes that are before the context node in document order is a reverse axis. 
Thus, the ancestor, ancestor-or-self, preceding, and preceding-sibling axes are reverse axes; all other axes are forward axes. 
Since the self axis always contains at most one node, it makes no difference whether it is a forward or reverse axis. 
The proximity position of a member of a node-set with respect to an axis is defined to be the position of the node in the node-set ordered in document order if the axis is a forward axis and ordered in reverse document order if the axis is a reverse axis. 
The first position is 1." This is the first paragraph of section 2.4 Predicates. 
It deals exclusively with axes and its place is in section 2.2 Axes. 
Thanks, Dimitre Novatchev. 
Do you Yahoo!? Free Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now Hello Dimitre, I am not sure what version of the XPath 2.0 document you are reading. 
The Last Call version is linked from the XML Query Working Group webpage, and can be found at this URI: In this version, the section on Axes is numbered 3.2.1.1, and it contains the material cited in your note (but in a slightly different form). 
The section on Predicates is numbered 3.2.2 and it does not contain the cited material.

Do you Yahoo!? Free Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now I'm really sorry -- this was the XPath 1.0 spec ... Obviously it's harmful to do anything serious on a Friday evening.
