<s> Unfortunately, different systems use different mapping tables from Shift-JIS to Unicode.  </s>
<s> The same thing applies to ISO-2022-JP and Japanese EUC.  </s>
<s> Such mapping tables are very unlikely to disappear soon.  </s>
<s> More about this, see XML Japanese Profile at: Such unstable mapping spoils interoperatibility and is fatal especially for digital signature.  </s>
<s> Although we do not have any really good solutions, we can assign different charset names to different mapping tables.  </s>
<s> For this reason, I am going to propose quite a few charsets for Shift-JIS, Japanese EUC, and ISO-2022-JP.  </s>
<s> They are new charsets rather than aliases of existing charsets (i.e., shift_jis, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp), which does not have agreed mapping tables.  </s>

<s> Hello Makoto, I have tried to look at the .xml  </s>

<s> XMLSpy complains that there is no ID on characterMapping (required according to My guess is that the problem is due to some updates in the CharacterMapping DTD.  </s>
<s> I'm coping Mark to check.  </s>
<s> I suggest that you investigate the problems.  </s>
<s> If necessary, you can always resubmit the XML Japanese Profile Note to fix errors.  </s>

<s> The DTD was changed in the last version (December last year).  </s>
<s> The changes are listed in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/#Modifications  </s>
<s> The major change was the removal of import , which the UTC felt made the validity checking too cumbersome.  </s>
<s> In the previous version, you could use imports to override mappings in another version.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I see that you use import extensively, so that you would have to regenerate the files in their complete form.  </s>
<s> [There are three more changes that were approved this year for 2022 and some  </s>
<s> other minor cases, but they are backwards compatible.]  </s>

<s> Martin, Thank you very much for your quick reply.  </s>
<s> I have updated mapping files.  </s>
<s> I find that TR#22 uses the source - name_on_source - version syntax for identifiers.  </s>
<s> I am wondering if I should change names.  </s>
<s> Since the Japanese XML Profile has been available for a while, I don't want to change.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Makoto  </s>
<s> Hello Mark, Is it possible for the UTC to provide a version of this DTD that is guaranteed not to change (even if it may become outdated by a new version)?  </s>
<s> This would help avoid problems in the future.  </s>
<s> As for import , I think the main functionality that Makoto needs (small file size, no data duplication) can be achieved with XML entities.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> We plan only backwards compatible changes at this point.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons import was dropped was exactly that it could be done with entities, and the older definition was complicated by the need to resolve conflicts.  </s>
<s> I will bring this up at the UTC, though, so that we can record this as a policy.  </s>
