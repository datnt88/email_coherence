On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question. 
A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to leaving this question to the implementors. 
C.2 should XML prescribe the use of an ENTITY-END character as the canonical method of handling entity boundaries, as a way of simplifying exposition and implementation (6.2.2)? 
I don't see suggestions for kludgey implementations of a feature as easing either exposition or implementation. 
If we simply disallow lexing of entity references between unescaped  and  characters, we can solve all the Ee problems. 
An implementation then must be able to resolve entities when an attribute value is examined. 
Clean, and I think it's even easy to do with LEX. 
I'd rather not mention the Ee strategy, and certainly would not require it.

As ENTITY-END is not really a character (like the infamous RE/RS pair) I'd lean to leaving this out. 
My inclination would be leave it out of the XML spec. 
(I didn't really understand "Ee" until almost two years of working with SGML and studying the Handbook; I don't think it simplifies the exposition at all, rather quite the reverse...) --Joe English jenglish@crl.com
