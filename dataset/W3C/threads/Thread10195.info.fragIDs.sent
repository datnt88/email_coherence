<s> I attach a marked up copy of the concepts doc containing a lot of green ink.  </s>
<s> The good news is that its green which makes it stylistic rather than substantive comment.  </s>
<s> The bad news is that there is a lot of it.  </s>
<s> I've only got about half way through.  </s>
<s> I'll try to find time tomorrow to mark up the rest, but may have to steal it from working on schema with Danbri.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian I hope that Graham and I will be able to work out a detailed response soon - however I wanted to make a high level comment, partly because I feel relatively neutral and can see both sides of a philosophical disagreement.  </s>
<s> Back in July we had extended e-mail and telecon time on this document, with the main contention being its scope and purpose.  </s>
<s> Some of Graham's original hopes were scaled back, but I don't think your puritanism (which I could support) was endorsed by the WG.  </s>
<s> I felt that there was support for some of Frank's recorded comments: 14:45:38 dajobe-la fmanola: material in M&amp;S which was explantory in nature which has exlcuded from other specs 14:45:59 dajobe-la ... and should be kept around, but primer was being overloaded - too long 14:46:37 dajobe-la .. needed a different home but end up with a kind of scrapbook 14:46:57 dajobe-la ... so need to fill it out to make it look more coherent 14:47:04 dajobe-la which tends to duplicate other stuff  </s>
<s> I believe that Graham and I should look at whether your comments can help us reduce duplication, but I do not believe that the WG wants the normative documents to be anoerexic; and I will be very surprised if we accept all of your comments.  </s>
<s> Personally I would support an editorial style across our normative Recs which said that discursive and non-normative material is, where possible, omitted.  </s>
<s> This would impact all the specs except for vocabulary, and maybe test cases.  </s>
<s> I think syntax would be approx halved, concepts possibly more serverely, the model theory would be somewhat thinned - the proposed lbase appendix would be aborted.  </s>
<s> I doubt that such a policy would get wg support, not least because too many of the WG are editors who would lose some of the text with which they intend to educate the world.  </s>
<s> A further problem with such a policy is that at least parts of our discursive material (such as the introductory parts of the model theory) have been very well received.  </s>
<s> (In fact, if we were to have such a policy, I would hope an exception would be made for that part of the model theory).  </s>
<s> I might need to consult with the ink and toner divisions before casting HP's vote for such a policy.  </s>
<s> As always, there is time pressure; and given that we haven't had such a policy as clear in advance I think it is unrealistic to expect the next batch of WD to follow it.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I have given up on getting the kind of minimalist specs I would prefer.  </s>
<s> However there is a matter of degree.  </s>
<s> So will I.  </s>
<s> I'm not looking for such a policy.  </s>
<s> I have come to accept some discursive material.  </s>
<s> It is the quality of that material that is now my concern.  </s>
<s> I don't.  </s>
<s> I'm highlighting these issues now so the editors have a sense of the scale of work required to get to last call.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian, I find a majority of your comments to be helpful.  </s>
<s> There are some where, no surprise, we fundamentally disagree.  </s>
<s> I'll respond here to the problematic ones, and those where I seek further clarification; the others I'll work on with editorial discretion.  </s>
<s> Section 2, references to background material.  </s>
<s> Recalling the difficulties I had when originally learning about RDF, I think references to background information are really important.  </s>
<s> I will look to de-emphasize them so that  </s>
<s> they may appear less ostentatious, but I strongly resist removing them.  </s>
<s> (But if anyone feels they are not the most appropriate references I  </s>
<s> would be happy to entertain others.) Much of the material in section 2.2.7 was included in response to a reasonable comment, though I agree mostly belongs in concepts.  </s>
<s> I'll reorganize it rather than remove it.  </s>
<s> Terms, definition/introduction and use: I have tried to use HTML styles dfn and cite for these; the formatting is just what's in the stylesheet.  </s>
<s> These happen to be easy to apply using my HTML editor.  </s>
<s> Section 2.4.4:  </s>
<s> Datatypes, means and ends: I don't agree with, or misunderstand, your comment.  </s>
<s> I think a datatype *is* a _means_, the _end_ being to do roughly what I said.  </s>
<s> I'll try for some wording that finesses the distinction.  </s>
<s> Section 2.4.5:  </s>
<s> I think this section makes an important point.  </s>
<s> I can massage the words.  </s>
<s> Section 2.4.6:  </s>
<s> Most of this was in response to an observed confusion.  </s>
<s> Entailment is a different kind of specification from those found in other protocol definitions, and I felt that it needed some exposition.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Why? The job of a spec is to specify.  </s>
<s> If we wanted to explain why things  </s>
<s> are the way they are we should have written a rationale as well.  </s>
<s> I feel pretty strongly about this.  </s>
<s> Ah that sounds right.  </s>
<s> Well you say [[Datatyping in RDF is the use of a datatype to associate a lexical form with a denoted value.]]  </s>
<s> That is a means to achieve the end I suggested [[Datatypes are used in RDF to represent values such as integers, floating point numbers and dates.]]  </s>
<s> Then goal is to express values.  </s>
<s> What point?  </s>
<s> Err, RDF isn't a protocol.  </s>
<s> You are right it needs some mention, but as I suggest, perhaps fewer more focussed words.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Short answer: because it's information that I would have found very helpful when I was trying to understand about RDF.  </s>
<s> I'll spare you a long answer, and suggest a compromise: (a) I separate the citations into a separate section titled something like "background reading".  </s>
<s> (b) We coordinate with Frank to put that section into the Primer.  </s>
<s> (a) there may be alternative serialization forms (b) RDF/XML is the (only) one that is standardized by this family of specifications  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> gk:  </s>
<s> There is a need to counterbalance a view that N-triples is a normative serialization.  </s>
<s> N-Triples get used by: RDF test cases; RDF Syntax; OWL test case and OWL abstract Syntax (sort of).  </s>
<s> Given that RDF/XML is disgusting and N-triples (and N3) aren't if we don't emphasis that N-triples is not a standard then there is a danger of misunderstanding.  </s>
<s> Whether this belongs here or not is another issue.  </s>
<s> Some of my comments on the syntax doc had the intent of emphasising the lack of normativity of N-triple.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
