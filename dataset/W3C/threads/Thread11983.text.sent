I know I was asked to give a problematic case for satisfying checkpoint 3.2.2, but I'd like to offer an alternative wording. 
If there's still disagreement I'll provide the problem case. 
I've read the minutes (whoever wrote those up does a fabulous job, is that you Charles?) and I think the spirit of the checkpoint is to allow the author to identify all elements in the document that are editable or that will affect the output created by the authoring tool. 
Identification can be done in a number of ways: provide textual equivalents for all elements (e.g. tags in HTML markup editor), allow enumeration of all elements in accessible dialogues (Freelance Graphics, a presentation creation tool, has an interface for cycling through all elements on the page with a choice to select the item), provide meaningful names for elements with a "go to named item" facility (spreadsheets have named cells and ranges), etc. 
In this light I believe 3.2.2, worded as is, is more of a technique for satisfying the more specific need: 3.2.2: (My proposed wording) Allow the author to identify all document elements that are editable or that affect output created by the authoring tool. 
Does this capture the spirit of 3.2.2? -- Bruce I like the rewording as long as we make it clear somewhere what "allow the author to identify" means and that it needs to be available in an accessible format. 
Jutta I agree with Bruce's wording and feel that Jutta's concern that we be sure that it is implicitly understood that these things are themselves accessible. 
I don't think this should be in the checkpoint (call me Mr. Terse) but I'm sure it's fairly clear elsewhere that *everything* about the tools must be accessible. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Yes, I think that it captures very well what is required. 
The bit about everything that is available being able to be represented in a diffrerent format is covered by 3.2.1 (although I think we could word it a bit better, along the lines of the guideline wording for 3.4 - I'll have a go later) and the access to the various properties is covered by 3.4.1 
Charles McCN I like the rewording as long as we make it clear somewhere what "allow the author to identify" means and that it needs to be available in an accessible format.
