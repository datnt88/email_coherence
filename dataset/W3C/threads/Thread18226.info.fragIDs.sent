Hello, I've just published the 8 March 2000 versions of the UA Guidelines [1], Techniques [2], and Implementation Report [3]. 
I apologize for the delays, but I hope the results will make it worth the wait. 
I realize that there isn't much time before tomorrow's meeting, but please try to review the Guidelines before the teleconference tomorrow [4]. 
I would like to ensure that this draft represents the resolutions to issues raised during Candidate Rec. 
I did not have time to write, edit, and incorporate long descriptions into this version of the techniques document. 
I realize this is important and will do this as soon as possible. 
Still to come: - A list of changes for the Guidelines. 
I won't put together a list of changes to the Techniques since this was a major overhaul. 
- Updated impact matrix. 
- I may update the UA responsibilities document. 
Best regards, - Ian
