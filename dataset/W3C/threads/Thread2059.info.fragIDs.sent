<s> I just read a very interesting proposal:  </s>
<s> From: "Electronic Commerce Standards for the WWW (Spyglass)" Tue Dec 6 21:54:52 1994 |Simple Authentication - OPTIONAL |This scheme, proposed by Spyglass, uses a random challenge sent from |the server to the client.  </s>
<s> The client encodes the random challenge |using the user's password as an encryption key in order to establish |authentication.  </s>
<s> See Note B for a full specification.  </s>
<s> |This method is currently indicated as OPTIONAL, but Spyglass believes |that it should become REQUIRED for HTTP compliance.  </s>
<s> This was something of an eye-opener.  </s>
<s> It's so simple.  </s>
<s> We should have been doing this all along.  </s>
<s> There was never any reason to send passwords in the clear (well, uuencoded), given HTTP's two-round-trip  </s>
<s> authentication mechanism.  </s>
<s> Why is this nifty proposal tucked away in a corner?  </s>
<s> Why didn't I hear about it before now?  </s>
<s> I thought I was pretty tuned in to this sort of thing...  </s>
<s> For the longest time, I was under the impression that the web user base would have two choices: 1. Use a free browser, and access only public information, or send your password essentially in the clear to subscribe to for-pay info.  </s>
<s> 2. Use a commercial browser that supports the security options (SHTTP, SSL, kerberos...) supported by the services you use.  </s>
<s> The reason I believed this was that real security is to expensive to develop to give away (and it almost always requires a license of some kind...).  </s>
<s> As a result, information providers are faced with the unfortunate choice between: 1. Require users to send passwords essentially in the clear.  </s>
<s> 2. Require users to license a browser.  </s>
<s> This message is a call to eliminate passwords-in-the-clear from HTTP.  </s>
<s> This means the browser developers should implement something like the spyglass proposal (it looks like a few hours more work to upgrade to this from the existing basic auth.  </s>
<s> scheme), and subscription-based information providers should _strongly_ encourage their user base to upgrade.  </s>
<s> Something like: "Please upgrade to a browser that doesn't send passwords in the clear (such as... links to recommended browsers.).  </s>
<s> In 6 months, we will not be accepting Basic authentication."  </s>
<s> I suggest that Spyglass lead the way by releasing source code patches to lynx and Mosaic to implement this enhancement, just to show how it's done.  </s>
<s> It should be a "simple" excercise for them.  </s>
<s> Using high-quality services on the web should not be an incentive to send passwords over the net in the clear.  </s>
<s> Let's fix this!  </s>
<s> Dan p.s. I hear s-key is another simple technology that eliminates the need to send passwords in the clear.  </s>
<s> But for the life of me, I can't find a technical description of it.  </s>
<s> Is there an RFC that I just can't find?  </s>
<s> Could somebody send me a pointer?  </s>
<s> Eric from Spyglass posted to www-talk a proposal for using MD5 encryption in a system like this a few weeks ago - it looked solid, and I'm waiting for a server and a browser to implement it (WN and Arena maybe?) so I can set it up for HotWired.  </s>
<s> Only until 1997!  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> rom a quick glance at the list of browsers used on our site, less than %2 are more than 4 months behind the current rev of their browser, so I don't see that as a huge issue.  </s>
<s> However the above statement implies that a server can negotiate which type of authentication can be used: S: Here's a challenge.  </s>
<s> Encrypt it.  </s>
<s> C: Huh?  </s>
<s> S: oh, nevermind.  </s>
<s> Send me your uuencoded password.  </s>
<s> C: okay, here goes.... ...which doesn't seem to be in the specs anywhere.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to have two separate URL's for different authentication schemes, though I could hack around that by keeping around a list of browsers implementing challenge-response.  </s>

<s> This does look like a good idea.  </s>
<s> My one concern is that we'd want to make sure various extension mechanisms could live together before standardizing an Extension: header, but they seem to think this is not essential to make the protocol work.  </s>
<s> (Is there any other MD5 PW authentication proposals for WWW lurking around in draft form?  </s>
<s> I think I've seen this before, but I'm not sure, and I think it's been done lately for other protocols, too.) Albert Lunde Albert-Lunde@nwu.edu  </s>

<s> Yikes! Jinks!  </s>
<s> I asked for a reference to s-key in my p.s. Brian replies to other issues, but includes the address of his home-page.  </s>
<s> Dan wastes a little time surfing Brian's home-page, and subconsiously follows these links... Which has a handy reference to the S/Key paper from bellcore: After reading the S/Key paper, I think we should consider it in place of the simple challenge/response system.  </s>
<s> Advantages of S/Key: * passwords are _not_ stored on the server side in clear form.  </s>
<s> * user can securely use the same password at different sites * password can be changed without sending it over the net Drawbacks: * server-side passwd database is not read-only: server must update the user's count of logins each time * doesn't support the opaque="..." feature of the spyglass proposal Dan  </s>
