Hello all, When translating OWL Guide, I stumbled on what is likely a typo: 5.1.3. 
Complement [OWL DL] In paragraph after first example, this sentence: The class of NonConsumableThing includes as its members all individuals that do not belong to the extension of ConsumableThing. 
This set includes all *Wines*, Regions, etc. [...] It should read: "This set includes all *Winerys*, Regions, etc." hih, JJS. 
thanks for your reading of the guide and your email. 
you are right, wines should not be listed.

Deborah, Indeed :-) However, I would like to point out a somehow related issue, that is the use of plural forms when dealing with property or element names of the language, or even with arbitrary class names. 
For example, consider the following sentence found in first paragraph of section 4 of OWL Overview http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#s4 : Furthermore, OWL DL requires that properties are either ObjectProperties or DatatypeProperties: DatatypeProperties are relations between instances of classes and RDF literals and XML Schema datatypes, while ObjectProperties are relations between instances of two classes. 
A native English speaker will probably take "ObjectProperties" (or "DatatypeProperties"), meaning obviously "several occurrences of properties of type DatatypeProperty". 
But other natural language may have different plural forms and rules, or conventions (at least in Western languages). 
When translating, one would normally take into account these differences and "adapt" the original wording as to match the target language conventions. 
Generally, in order to obviate any ambiguity, it ends up in the sentence being more explicit. 
So, for example, the sentence above would become something like: "Futhermore, OWL DL requires that properties are either of type ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty: properties of type DatatypeProperty are relations ..." The same applies to arbitrary class names. 
In either case, a problem lies in the fact that the plural forms of these class names often don't match those in definitions. 
For example, there are "Wines" in the text , but there is owl:Class rdf:ID='Wine' in the definition. 
And, due to markup, both terms appear in the same monospaced font, adding to the confusion. 
Though this topic is probably better suited in w3c-translators, it may also be of interest here. 
hih, JJS
