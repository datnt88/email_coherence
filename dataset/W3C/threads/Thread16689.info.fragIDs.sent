<s> That's because Bobby does not see xml:lang as a "problem", it just has no idea what the attribute is.  </s>
<s> In other words, that looks like span asdf="fdsa" something /span to Bobby.  </s>
<s> Bobby has no way of knowing that it's an attempt to indicate a language change; ergo, it can't flag it.  </s>

<s> Hi  </s>
<s> As far as I'm concerned it's a Bobby bug, even when the Language is set in the HTTP headers Bobby has this: 1. Identify the language of the text.  </s>
<s> (1 instance) Line 3 The last version of Bobby came up with loads of 'browser compability' errors when one was using XHTML rather than HTML, most of these seem to have been fixed apart from supporting xml:lang.  </s>

<s> Hi Ineke, it may be that there is a bug in Bobby.  </s>
<s> It is only a piece of software, and there is no reason to imagine it is a perfect one.  </s>
<s> I am sure they have a feedback mechanism so you can report it, so they can fix it in future.  </s>
<s> Also, Bobby does ask a user to test a number of things themself before adding an icon, but there is no check that these things were tested - CAST doesn't sue people who are misusing the icon... cheers Charles McCN Hi Kynn, Chas and the others.  </s>
