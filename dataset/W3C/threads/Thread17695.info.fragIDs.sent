<s> I propose that the guideline read: "Allow users to turn off blinking text.  </s>
<s> The text should be rendered as visible text."  </s>
<s> First, I think that mention of non-standard HTML elements should be avoided when possible.  </s>
<s> Second, CSS1 allows a blinking effect ('text-decoration: blink') and I suspect that the guideline would want UAs to turn off this blinking as well.  </s>
<s> Section 4.3 2.[PRIORITY 1] When an IMG element has a value for the "longdesc" attribute and  the user has turned off the display of images, give the user access to  the long description.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the user (or at least some users) have access even if the images are turned on?  </s>
<s> The LONGDESC should be rendered as a link with a "D" caption after the  short description provided by "alt" or "title".  </s>
<s> The link should act as  a standard link.  </s>
<s> Because the longdesc is not rendered inline, I propose instead:  </s>
<s> "Access to the long description should be provided through a link.  </s>
<s> The link text should be the value of the alt or title attribute followed by  </s>
<s> the letter "D"."  </s>
<s> If images are turned on, the image becomes one of the links that can  be accessed through keyboard navigation.  </s>
<s> Since IMG can also be part  of anchors a separate keyboard command is needed to select the URL  associated with "longdesc".  </s>
<s> The meaning of this is unclear to me.  </s>
<s> If a link to the long description is rendered in the document (as a standard link), why would there be any need to treat it, or the IMG element that engendered it, specially?  </s>
<s> Do the last few sentences of the guideline only apply when the IMG is the content of an A element.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand the meaning here.  </s>
<s> Finally, perhaps these sentences should be moved elsewhere since the guideline specifically says "when the user has turned off the display of images."  </s>
<s> Section 4.4 3.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to suspend timer based animations as the result  of DTML timer scripting events.  </s>
<s> Users with some disabilities may not  be able to follow the animation or the animation may trigger seizures.  </s>
<s> I propose dropping "as the result of DHTML timer scripting events."  </s>
<s> Also, what is a "timer-based animation"?  </s>
<s> Does the guideline refer to all animations or only certain ones?  </s>
<s> Section 4.6  </s>
<s> I think guidelines 2 and 3 need fixing.  </s>
<s> - The examples are too long (though useful).  </s>
<s> I propose an appendix where table serialization is discussed.  </s>
<s> - The guidelines are the same, but two types of tables are discussed (those with header info and those without, the latter more likely to be used for layout).  </s>
<s> The guideline should just be: "Allow the user to select serialized representation of table by row or column order."  </s>
<s> Then, the two cases can be discussed in the prose.  </s>
<s> - Guideline 3 reads "A table that includes "TH" tags indicates that the table is being used for data rendering and that row and column position are important for understanding the information."  </s>
<s> What about people who use TH to get a style effect, like bold text?  </s>
<s> - The two guidelines have been created from one, but some information has not been pruned during editing.  </s>
<s> Namely, the statemetn "Users should be able to specify whether they want the cells rendered row order or column order."  </s>
<s> should be removed.  </s>
<s> Also, the Note (Table serialization is important for tables used to structure tabular information as well as those used to lay out blocks of information.) should be removed since both cases are to be explored explicitly.  </s>
<s> 4. "Try again feature allow the use ..."  </s>
<s> This guideline seems redundant since the previous serialization guidelines refer to allowing the user to choose from among serialization approaches.  </s>
<s> I propose that this guideline be dropped.  </s>
<s> However, more information about serialization alternatives might be provided in the previous guidelines.  </s>
<s> 6.4 Direct Access Navigation 1.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the current page to be searched using keyboard commands  for a given phrase.  </s>
<s> If the search text is found, the selection should  be moved to the occurrence.  </s>
<s> If the text occurs within an link, the focus should be changed to the anchor.  </s>
<s> 2.[PRIORITY 2] Allow only the text associated with links (including ALT text  for images that are links) on the current page to be searched using  keyboard commands for a given phrase.  </s>
<s> If the search text is found, the focus should be moved to the occurrence.  </s>
<s> 5.[PRIORITY 2] Allow the user to use the keyboard to move the selection  directly to elements by searching for text matches that includes ALT  text, TITLE text and LONDESC text in the search.  </s>
<s> 6.[PRIORITY 3] User option to include the text contents of LONGDESC links to be  included in text searches of the current page.  </s>
<s> If the search text is  found in a LONGDESC link, the focus should be changed to the LONGDESC link on the current page.  </s>
<s> I think these four guidelines should be harmonized (among themselves, and with the wording of the adjacent guidelines).  </s>
<s> I propose:  </s>
<s> 1.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to use the keyboard to perform a text search of the  </s>
<s> current page.  </s>
<s> If the search text is found, the selection should be set to the matched text.  </s>
<s> If the text occurs within a link, the focus should be moved to the link.  </s>
<s> 2.[PRIORITY 2] Allow the user to use the keyboard to perform a text search of  </s>
<s> link text only on the current page.  </s>
<s> Link text includes the content of A elements and "alt" values for images used as links.  </s>
<s> If the search text is found, the focus should be moved to the link.  </s>
<s> Numbers 5 and 6 should be combined: 5.[PRIORITY 3] Allow the user to use the keyboard to perform a text search only of values of the "alt" and "title" attributes, and within documents designed by "longdesc" attributes.  </s>
<s> If the search text is found, the selection should be set to the matched text.  </s>
<s> However, if the search text is in an external document, the focus should move to the "longdesc" link on the current page designating that document.  </s>

<s> Some comments on I think the guidelines in 8.1 1.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to turn off author styles represented by author style sheets.  </s>
<s> 2.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to adjust default values represented by browser style sheets.  </s>
<s> should be moved up in 4.1 Control over Browser Defaults and Author Styles There are not really about Compatibility, but Adjustability.  </s>
<s> Also, the "allow the user to turn off" CSS should be reinforced as being thru a simple user option, not done thru a script of some kind (I've heard IE supports the later, but that's not enough) Also, in the Compatibility section, I'm still in favor of saying: support all of HTML4.0, since by the time this guidelines is out, HTML4 will have been there for a year.  </s>
<s> We could add, "in particular, you need to support these...", but I'm not sure this will help.  </s>
<s> For CSS, we should say: full support of CSS1, in particular float, display:none, and then the list of CSS2 additions as it is in the document.  </s>
<s> 5.4 Title Information 1.[PRIORITY 2] Make the document TITLE available to the user.  </s>
<s> I'd like to add a P3 about getting the TITLE element of the target HTML document when the information is missing in the TITLE/ALT attribute at the source (in IMG, A, or FRAME).  </s>
<s> The TITLE element can be retrieved using a HTTP HEAD request or (if there's no TITLE in the HEAD), using an HTTP GET with a limited byte-range (just to get the beginning of the HTML file).  </s>

<s> ... The LONGDESC should be rendered as a link with a "D" I'm not sure how I should read the issue list, but I thought we'd decided to *not* recommend a particular UI for longdesc (e.g. in Windows, they use alt f someting to access a property sheet) I suggest saying *before* the appendices, that The following appendices are informative only.  </s>
