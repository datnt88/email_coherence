<s> Hi!! I need some clarifications regarding implementation of DOM interfaces.  </s>
<s> We are implementing the DOM interfaces in C++.  </s>
<s> My concern is that I do not want to violate the standard specification (dated 07 March, 2000)of the DOM interfaces as charted by W3C.... The following are a set of queries regarding the implementation of the DOM interfaces: 1)  </s>
<s> Will it be acceptable to replace the standard data members of a DOM  </s>
<s> interface (like nodename) with get and set mechanism in the public (exposed) section of the class and put the standard data members like nodename in the private section?  </s>
<s> For ex- Class CDomNode DOMString nodeName; public: DOMString getNodeName();//Substitute for nodeName atribute in the public section.  </s>
<s> void setNodeName(DOMString str); //Substitute for nodeName atribute in the public section.  </s>
<s> 2)  </s>
<s> Will it be acceptable to have one or more non-standard data members in  </s>
<s> the private section of the implementation of the DOM interfaces?  </s>
<s> i.e. Will it be considered a non standard DOM interface if the implemenatation of the DOM interface contains one or more non-standard data members in the private section of the class apart from all the standard data members?? Class CDomNode int x;//Extra Non standard data member ?  </s>
<s> A standard violation??? /*All standard data members of the DOM interface like nodename, nodevalue, nodetype, firstchild, lastChild, nextSibling etc... are declared here*/ public: /*interfaces*/ 3)  </s>
<s> What do we mean by readonly declaration of a DOM specification data  </s>
<s> member ex ?  </s>
<s> readonly DOMString nodeName??Does it mean declaring the standard data member like nodename or nodevalue in the private or protected section of the implemenation class?? 4) Also Iam making the assumption that the name of the implementation of DOM interface i.e. in the above case CDomNode (class name) can be non-standard.  </s>
<s> As per section 1.1.2 of ?Memory Management?  </s>
<s> in the DOM standard specification(line 1, first para.), the following statement tells us that the I indeed can add an extra non-standard data member in the private section, as well as provide get and set mechanisms for manipulating the standard data members like nodename, nodevalue .  </s>
<s> ?That means that an implementation need only expose methods with the defined names and specified operation, not implement classes that correspond directly to the interfaces.? Please clarify!! Thanks and regards, Hari (From Wipro).  </s>
<s> Why reinvent the wheel?  </s>
<s> Xerces already has DOM in C++.  </s>
<s> At the very least, if should answer your questions.  </s>
<s> Mark  </s>
<s> These questions may already have been answered, but...  </s>
<s> interface (like  nodename) with get and set mechanism A DOM has no "standard data members".  </s>
<s> All DOM properties are accessed via setter and getter methods.  </s>
<s> Remember, the DOM is _only_ an API; there is no assurance that the structure of the data behind that API bears any resemblence to the tree-of-nodes view presented by the DOM.  </s>
<s> the private  section of the implementation of the DOM interfaces?  </s>
<s> See above; data members are outside the scope of the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> The DOM only defines the behavior of the DOM API.  </s>
<s> If your implementation has other features as well, that's fine as long as the DOM APIs behave as described in the spec.  </s>
<s> (It's not uncommon for DOM implementations to add a few custom features.  </s>
<s> Of course any code which uses those features sacrifices portability.)  </s>
<s> member See above.  </s>
<s> A readonly attribute has a getter method but no setter.  </s>
<s> 4) Also I am making the assumption that the name of the implementation of  </s>
<s> DOM  interface i.e. in the above case CDomNode (class name) can be non-standard.  </s>
<s> The abstract DOM interface should use the standard names.  </s>
<s> The class which inherits/implements that interface may use any name that's appropriate, as long as it can also be manipulated via the standardized name.  </s>
<s> (You may want to take a look at some of the existing Java and C++ implementations for examples.  </s>
<s> Or, perhaps, adapt one of those rather than creating your own from scratch.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
