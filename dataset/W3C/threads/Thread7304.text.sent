I haven't said anything about this because I've been relecutant to criticize a proposal on aesthetic grounds. 
but the idea of using separate media types for each action really bothers me. 
Why don't we introduce a single media type application/webdav and then use a parameter for the specific action, as in application/webdav;action=delete Gregory Woodhouse gjw@wnetc.com home page: http://www.wnetc.com/home.html

This has been suggested by a number of people and I am starting to like it. 
The only real argument against it is that it makes it more difficult to parse requests. 
If a request is a copy I want to send it to program A but if it is a delete I want to send it to program B. However as I expect we will agree on a compromise to introduce new method names but allow for the use of post and depend on the application/webdav mime type, I think we can make everyone equally unhappy. 
Which, of course, is the definition of compromise. 
=) Yaron As I understand the MIME types specification, this usage doesn't really fit. 
Isn't there some other approach to adding the verbs? 
For example, if I understand the PEP document, we should add a Protocol and use header info. 
to get the behavior. 
It provides for querying for support, and leaves content type alone. 
You would still want to have a way to directly address a version using a URL.

MIME parameters are normally descriptive of the nature of the content, and don't really express operations. 
What I was thinking of for having actions be expressed as POST was really that the POST-ed data might be multipart/action-request part 1: type = action-description part 2: related data part 3: related data and that you could be backward compatible by supporting forms that used multipart/form-data. 
Larry I like this better. 
I wasn't altogether comfortable with application/webdav for the same reasons you state but couldn't think of anything better at the time.
