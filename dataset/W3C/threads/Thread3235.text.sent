Just pottering around the website - I know Dave and Jan have started it thinking about this: I think the intention of this deliverable is ambigious: Month 5: (10.2: scalable_rdbms_mapping_report) Public report on mapping data from RDBMS. 
This will describe current best practice on using existing RDBMS or other storage systems for general Semantic Web data. 
(2 months, report, Pub.) 'mapping from' seems rather different to 'mapping to', i.e. you could have existing data in RDBMS and map it to RDF, or you could be storing general RDF in RDBMS. 
This deliverable seems to cover both. 
Do we think this is the case? 
I think it should :) cheers Libby That was (I think) the intention with this wording.

Libby Miller said: I wrote it to be flexible and indeed wanted to and from them in the scope. 
Jan and I have started sketching notes in the draft area. 
It also can cover "other storage systems" that are not RDBMSes.
