CMN: I think the "pictures of words" bit should go back to the WCAG group. 
GJR: which part? that pictures of words ain't words? 
no, it's not a pipe -- it's a question... gregory. 
The optimist thinks that this is the best of all possible worlds; the pessimist knows it is.

Webmaster &amp; Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC The Visually Impaired Computer Users' Group of the New York City Metropolitan Area a) everything that generates debate in XTECH should go back to the affected groups -- here at least GL and UA -- who may confirm or deny acquiescence in the proposal of the intergroup caucus. 
But perhaps after giving XTECH some time to settle on a provisional resolution of the question. 
Cf. conference committee in a bicameral legislature such as in the U.S. Let me add that I'd like to see a concrete proposal before I would want to take any UAWG time reconsidering our definitions.

My original comment was related to the fact that in my first proposal I pointed out that graphic images of text have some features of text content (like the fact that they rely on written communication) and some features of non-text content (like the fact that they are not able to be rendered as characters on the screen which can also be spoken by a speech synthesiser...) I think that this should not be in the definition (as Kynn pointed out) but should be in the relevant places in the various guidelines - primarily in WCAG as far as I can tell.
