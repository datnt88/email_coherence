<s> I would like to see an example of a nonmonotonic rule that is worth publishing.  </s>
<s> Notice that you are passing the buck and are refusing to back up your statements.  </s>
<s> I'll offer you a challenge: show me a nonmonotonic rule, and I'll undertake to send you back a case where it would immediately produce a false answer.  </s>
<s> "Birds normally fly" "Sick birds normally don't" "Penguins don't fly"  </s>
<s> I think I know what your counter-case would be, but how would you express this kind of stuff monotonically?  </s>
<s> You would need a bunch of exceptions and every time you add another exception you would change some of your previous formulas.  </s>
<s> This is not compositional.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, your monotonic rules are much less useful to me than the above non-monotonic ones.  </s>
<s> Note that the non-mon rules will give correct answer most of the time -- just like humans.  </s>
<s> Do you have a set of monotonic rules that gives a correct answer *all* the time?  </s>
<s> If I understand correctly what you have in mind, then your system will be giving the answer "I don't know" most of the time.  </s>
<s> In my view this is not as useful as giving a correct answer most of the time.  </s>
<s> The brittleness argument against non-monotonic reasoning is a red herring.  </s>
<s> I fundamentally disagree.  </s>
<s> It is absolutely central to the SWeb.  </s>
<s> Where is a proof of this statement?  </s>
<s> I would consider believing this if you produce a useful and non-trivial example to back this up.  </s>
<s> The onus is on you, since you are the one making the sweeping statements :-)  </s>
<s> People use non-monotonic reasoning in their daily life because it is useful most of the time.  </s>
<s> I see no reason why Semantic Web should be different.  </s>
<s> I see many reasons.  </s>
<s> Daily life is irrelevant (with that argument, we ought to have our SW agents talking in English): the point in what you say is that PEOPLE use these reasoning patterns.  </s>
<s> Sure, people do: people are a lot smarter than SW inference engines are likely to get; and people have access to exactly the relevant contextual background assumptions that the SW *formalisms* do not provide.  </s>
<s> You and I both know that SS numbers are unique identifiers and that lists of local cinemas are likely to be closed worlds for checking movie times, and so on (and on).  </s>
<s> Put yourself in an alien cultural context where you don't know things like this, and you will probably behave very differently, or make terrible gaffes in your reasoning, or maybe both.  </s>
<s> If all this contextual information were to be made explicit, things like unique-name/closed-world reasoning would be monotonic.  </s>
<s> In fact, I think that people almost never use true nonmonotonic reasoning.  </s>
<s> We use shortcuts, for sure (check out the 'recognition heuristic'): but we they find they are wrong, we acknowledge that they were wrong and change our minds; moreover, there are lots of well-documented effects in cognitive psychology which seem to show that even unconsciously, we are very sensitive to logical inconsistencies, eg the many varieties of 'cognitive dissonance'.  </s>
<s> That is fundamentally monotonic reasoning.  </s>
<s> A true nonmon reasoner wouldn't even notice that it had a contradiction to resolve, and it wouldn't need to change its mind.  </s>
<s> We say: tweety is a bird, so tweety can fly.  </s>
<s> Oh, wait, tweety is a penguin: I was wrong, tweety can't fly.  </s>
<s> It would say: Tweety is a bird, tweety can fly, tweety is a penguin, now tweety can't fly.... so?  </s>
<s> (This is an aside.  </s>
<s> The main point is that people are a hell of a lot smarter than anyone knows how to automate, so what people do is irrelevant; and in any case, we don't really know what people do.)  </s>
<s> I don't know how to respond to these two paragraphs of belle letters.  </s>
<s> There is nothing concrete to argue with.  </s>
<s> You are assuming (or claiming?) that all contextual information can be made explicit, and this is not my  </s>

<s> Being able to use closed-world reasoning, unique-name reasoning, default reasoning, etc., in situations where you know they are OK to use, provides great benefits.  </s>
<s> What we need are ways to be able to take advantage of the computational merits of such efficient reasoning processes, but within a globally monotonic system of information exchange.  </s>
<s> So, you are acknowledging that certain forms of non-monotonic reasoning are useful and you want to adopt them.  </s>
<s> Pardon if I misunderstood.  </s>
<s> While I haven't seen any convincing examples of monotonic rules that would cause me to want to send my agent and scoop them up, I do see reasons why I might want to have non-monotonic knowledge to be published.  </s>
<s> This is because most (if not all) rule-based applications that I've looked at use some kind of non-monotonicity.  </s>
<s> They use forms of reasoning that are conventionally thought of as nonmonotonic, because they rely on information that is conventionally not made explicit.  </s>
<s> If you do make it explicit, they are often monotonic.  </s>
<s> What I am arguing is not to throw away or banish these useful reasoning patterns, but to find a way to incorporate them into a globally monotonic framework of information interchange.  </s>
<s> Are you sure that they really USE nonmonotonicity?  </s>
<s> That is, they RELY on the fact that the reasoning pattern is indeed not monotonic, and would break if it were made monotonic?  </s>
<s> (An example might be a system that did closed-world reasoning but treated its conclusions as defaults, so that when new items were added to the world the old conclusions would be overridden.  </s>
<s> Now, that might be plausibly argued to be USING nonmonotonicity, rather than just kind of accidentally happening to be nonmonotonic.)  </s>
<s> This is too subtle for me.  </s>
<s> What is the difference between "using" non-monotonic reasoning and "being" non-monotonic?  </s>
<s> What I can say is that  </s>
<s> I haven't seen a rule-based system worth its salt, which is not using some sort of negation as failure somewhere.  </s>
<s> Does it mean "using" rather than "being"?  </s>
<s> I am ok with that.  </s>
<s> Then what is the argument about?  </s>
<s> If anything, I'd like them to be published so I could steal them :-) Seriously, though, suppose there is a service, say, a travel reservation service that specializes in multi-segment complex travel arrangements.  </s>
<s> Of necessity, such a service is going to use a form of closed-world assumption, since it will be looking only at a small subset of all available resources and make its recommendations based on that incomplete knowledge.  </s>
<s> It will base its conclusion on what it knows, to be sure.  </s>
<s> That doesnt make it inherently closed-world reasoning.  </s>
<s> Closed-world reasoning means that from a failure to find some atomic sentence, you *conclude* that it is *false*.  </s>
<s> You can make a recommendation based on what you know without drawing that conclusion.  </s>
<s> If the system makes inferences based on the fact that it failed to prove the contrary, then you are using closed-world reasoning.  </s>
<s> You are simply refusing to call a spade a spade.  </s>
<s> If it can't find a car rental somewhere, it will assume there isn't one and will try to find the next best alternative.  </s>
<s> No. It will assume that it can't rent a car and move on to the next alternative.  </s>
<s> That's not nonmonotonic: that's just being usefully pragmatic.  </s>
<s> If it published a conclusion that there were no rental cars (not that it couldnt find any - that is just flat true - but that there really were none), or if it drew a conclusion about some other matter from this assumption, then it would be nonmonotonic.  </s>
<s> In practice if it is reporting directly to humans in a web-service context then the difference between "there are none" and "I know of none" is likely to not matter much since the human will treat the former as though it meant the latter: but it might make a lot of difference in, say, a homeland security application, or in a reasoner which is deciding agent security policy questions.  </s>
<s> If it can't find a car, it would recommend me to use hotel A. If the set of premises changes and some car shows up in the database then it would recommend hotel B and not A. This is non-monotonic.  </s>
<s> Why would I want to have some specification of such a service published?  </s>
<s> Because I might be able to reason about how the service works.  </s>
<s> This service may require multiple interactions and my credit card may be charged several times.  </s>
<s> I might determine, for example, that the service won't charge my card unless there is a way to back out of the corresponding part of the deal or there is travel insurance provided, or ....  </s>
<s> OK to all that.  </s>
<s> But notice that is all META information about the service.  </s>
<s> You can monotonically express meta-information about anything, even C++ code.  </s>
<s> That has nothing to do with the non-monotonicity of the rules used in the system itself.  </s>
<s> I was giving an example where it is useful to publish non-monotonic rules.  </s>
<s> You are saying is that in this example I am reasoning not "with" those rules, but rather "about" those rules.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> Let's say I invoke this service as a query to find out something.  </s>
<s> Querying is reasoning, and if those rules use a form of negation as failure (which will be the case in most complex systems) then it would be an example of reasoning with published non-mon rules.  </s>
<s> --michael  </s>
<s> BTW, to do this kind of reasoning about any nontrivial system (monotonic or otherwise) is going to involve you in some heavy-duty reasoning.  </s>
<s> To make your case here more strongly, you might try arguing that *that* reasoning has to be done non-monotonically.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested to see any arguments made along those lines.  </s>
<s> Pat  </s>
<s> --michael  </s>
<s> Re. the (forever ongoing and interminable) debate about the merits of otherwise of nonmon reasoning.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: nonmon reasoning is brittle (by definition) but can be very efficient.  </s>
<s> So when you know it won't break, by all means use it.  </s>
<s> But it seems to me that it is up to its proponents to justify or explain how we can have nonmon formalisms being used in a Webbish context, where the brittleness (or if you prefer, context-sensitivity) seems on the face of it to be an unsurmountable barrier to deployment, since there is no way for a reader of some nonmon rules to know what the intended context is; and when used out of context, nonmon rules are almost always wrong, and can produce potentially dangerous errors.  </s>
<s> (Note, this is only referring to the *publication* of nonmon rules on a Web, not to their *use* in some application where it is known they are appropriate, or one is willing to take the risk of using them in any case.) So far, the only response Ive heard on this point is a kind of blustery denial: a claim that the Sweb just isn't going to be like the WWWeb, but more like an intranet, where all the users will just know, or will be told by the owner, or will agree among themselves in managers' meetings, which worlds are closed and which namespaces satisfy the unique-names assumption and so on; so the problem will be avoided by what might be called Web-external contextual agreements.  </s>
<s> I refuse to take this answer seriously: it seems to me to just be a statement to the effect that one is not working on the semantic web at all.  </s>
<s> Anyone got any other answers?  </s>
<s> Until someone has, I would suggest that all talk about nonmon systems be ruled out of order.  </s>
<s> Its not enough to observe in a general kind of way that nonmon systems are useful (no argument) or that they are in widespread use and all the best companies have them and they make a lot of money (irrelevant) or that they solve this or that famous problem (they usually don't, in any case).  </s>
<s> There is a basic technical issue that needs to be addressed.  </s>
<s> Address it, or else please shut up about them.  </s>

<s> Pat, This is a powerful statement, but I would like to see it backed up with examples of purely monotonic rules that are worth publishing.  </s>
<s> I would like to see an example of a nonmonotonic rule that is worth publishing.  </s>
<s> Well, true.  </s>
<s> But almost any implication would be an example of a monotonic rule, and such implications are ubiquitous.  </s>
<s> (True, many of them can be mapped directly into DL without using rules...) If its a penguin, it doesn't fly: that's monotonic.  </s>
<s> If its a time-interval, its endpoint is later than its startpoint... choose your favorite implication.  </s>
<s> I'll offer you a challenge: show me a nonmonotonic rule, and I'll undertake to send you back a case where it would immediately produce a false answer.  </s>
<s> 1. Im working in a center that rescues and tries to fix and re-release damaged or injured endangered birds.  </s>
<s> Birds here normally don't fly.  </s>
<s> 2. Im a specialist in diseases of raptors arising from acid rain pollution, which causes infertility, taking part in a study involving tagging wild birds and checking their nests.  </s>
<s> Many, maybe all, of the birds we track are sick, but they all fly.  </s>
<s> BTW, there is a terminological issue arising here.  </s>
<s> In at least one reading, rules like this which are explicit about "normally" can be viewed as monotonic.  </s>
<s> And the last example is monotonic on any reading (since it omits the "normally").  </s>
<s> No, there are many other alternatives.  </s>
<s> You don't need to have an explicit list of exceptions, all that is required is that there is a reference to some proposition which 'stands for' the exceptions (or more exactly, the truth of any exceptional condition.)  </s>
<s> You could use for example McCarthy's circumscription technique, and transcribe them as 'normal birds fly', etc.., from which it then follows monotonically that a non-flying bird (such as a sick bird or penguin) is not a normal bird.  </s>
<s> The pattern is more like: foo is a normal bird normal birds fly - foo flies normal birds fly not (foo flies) - (modus tollens) not (foo is a normal bird) both of which are monotonic inferences.  </s>
<s> The nonmonotonic step then would be foo is a bird -?- foo is a normal bird And if you want to make an circumscription-style assumption that all your birds are normal (unless you have been told otherwise) then by all means go ahead: I don't want to prevent anyone DOING nonmonotonic inference in the privacy of their own inference engine.  </s>
<s> My point is only that the semantics underlying SWeb communication, the semantics built into the information exchange protocols, needs to be monotonic.  </s>
<s> As long as you have some explicit way to encode that 'normally' part of your rules, and so distinguish 'birds normally fly' from 'birds fly', then we have no disagreement.  </s>
<s> That is exactly what I want to do as well.  </s>
<s> All that said, however, there is a real practical problem with 'normally' reasoning and circumscription, which is how to evaluate what happens when different notions of 'normal' (or 'typical') clash.  </s>
<s> This is of course an old observation (interacting defaults, for example) but its being old doesn't make it go away.  </s>
<s> And on the Web, the possibilities for communication breakdown are amplified.  </s>
<s> Birds normally fly most of the time, but if we are talking about birds in the Antarctic then its not so clear what counts as 'normal', etc.. Fact is, "normal" is kind of context-dependent in its meaning.  </s>
<s> It would be a lot safer, and more informative, if such a rule could mention explicitly an intended class of birds, and say that normally *in that class*, birds fly; and then a reader (particularly a reader as dirt-stupid as your average SW agent) can be alerted to the dangers of applying it to a small subclass, or a different class altogether.  </s>
<s> It would be more informative and safer still if it could give actual statistics, like "over 95% of birds in the class fly".  </s>
<s> If I may hazard an ad-hominem guess here for a second, I suspect that your use of the (Sweb-agent= human) analogy might be distorting  </s>
<s> your intuition.  </s>
<s> People like us are not consciously aware of using rules like "over 95% of birds in this class fly", and we certainly don't say things like that to one another.  </s>
<s> But (a) what people do is kind of irrelevant, and (b) it really is not clear what actually is going on inside people's heads when they reason: and (c) for sure, what is actually going on is a lot more complicated than what it 'feels' like to the thinker, or what people say to one another.  </s>
<s> We certainly don't think using natural language, and there is lots of evidence that we unconsciously  </s>
<s> do things like make fine-grained numerical estimates of relative likelihoods which we are quite unable to sense by introspection; and that when we do reason, we are using far, far more information than we are consciously aware of, or ever actually say explicitly to one another in natural language.  </s>
<s> The system I prefer will be giving answers of the general form "assuming everything is normal, foo flies" or maybe "assuming foo is a normal bird, ..." where of course the qualification, being generic, could be understood or implicit in a real QA protocol (though it should be explicit for the reasoners under the hood.) And I would prefer it to have a more structured account of "normal", if at all possible.  </s>
<s> The brittleness argument against non-monotonic reasoning is a red herring.  </s>
<s> I fundamentally disagree.  </s>
<s> It is absolutely central to the SWeb.  </s>
<s> Well, the point seems to be widely accepted, but it also seems kind of obvious.  </s>
<s> It has to do with publishing content on the Web.  </s>
<s> If A publishes X which is later read by B, and B has no access to any of the context that A is assuming, then the semantic protocols defining the information that is conveyed from A to B by X have to assume that this information is independent of the context.  </s>
<s> Since A cannot, by the very nature of the WWW architecture, possibly know what other information may be available to B and combined with X to draw conclusions, the meaning of X has to be monotonic.  </s>
<s> People use non-monotonic reasoning in their daily life because it is useful most of the time.  </s>
<s> I see no reason why Semantic Web should be different.  </s>
<s> I was reacting to your argument to the effect that people do it, so the SW can do it.  </s>

<s> The point I am apparently not getting across is that many of these inference techniques are NOT inherently non-monotonic.  </s>

<s> It is one thing to say that these inference types are useful and should be supported: they are, and should.  </s>

<s> Even your examples would be fine with me as long as the rules do indeed somehow formally state the 'normally' assumption.  </s>
<s> If I publish the claim that normally, birds fly, and you make an inference from that about a particular bird, then it is you who has made the assumption of normality.  </s>
<s> This is not the same situation as me publishing the (unqualified) claim that birds fly, and then expecting, because Web logic is inherently nonmonotonic, that you will be able to understand that when I say birds fly, I don't actually mean that birds fly.  </s>
<s> Here's a way to understand the distinction operationally: A publishes the rule (birds fly), B reads and applies it to some case (bird foo), and the answer turns out to be wrong (foo doesnt fly).  </s>
<s> What went wrong?  </s>
<s> The 'globally nonmonotonic logic' answer is: nothing is wrong.  </s>
<s> The answer I prefer is, if A said that birds fly, then A is wrong.  </s>
<s> If on the other hand A said, (normally, birds fly), then B made an assumption about foo (that it was normal) that turned out to be wrong.  </s>
<s> The answer I want to avoid is, A didnt really mean what he seemed to mean, or that what A meant was somehow context-dependent in some invisible way.  </s>
<s> I want it to be possible for B's understanding of the content of A's rule to be unambiguous and independent of any context that A might be assuming.  </s>
<s> Well, Im not sure what you consider to be a 'rule-based system' but if 'rule' includes Horn clauses, then there are plenty of examples.  </s>

<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> I have no quarrel with closed-world reasoning; I just don't want to get it muddled up with open-world reasoning.  </s>
<s> Closed world reasoning is monotonic provided you refer to the closed world as a suitable antecedent.  </s>
<s> I look up 'Joe' in a DB called employees and don't find him there; AND I know the DB has all the employees in it.  </s>

<s> Yes thats what thought occurred to me; use some statistically informed reasoning.  </s>
<s> The only thing is that people are notoriously bad at generating statistics, so it should be more like 96.0+-3.99 % of birds fly.  </s>
<s> If it really has major exceptional cases like Penguins, baby birds, sick birds etc, then the bird watchers should collect data on approximate numbers of population sizes to this level of detail/distinction.  </s>
<s> If you have data on species, health of birds, age of birds, etc then computing this flight statistic should be more precise.  </s>
<s> also sick is vague.  </s>
<s> How sick?  </s>
<s> Sick with what?  </s>
<s> How precise of an answer do you really care about anyway?  </s>
<s> Only a nit-picky pedantic twit would say that "over 95% of birds fly" is not an acceptable answer for most people in real life.  </s>
<s> It also seems to me that also having some rough idea of population sizes, can help inform the reasoning engine in other ways.  </s>
<s> For example 4.0e9 to 7.0e9 people in the world.  </s>
<s> Company X employs less than 1200 people.  </s>
<s> I have list of 1057 of them.  </s>
<s> Y is a person not on the list, what is the chance he is an employee of X? Pretty slim?  </s>
<s> Of course then if you add that all of the employees live in a town of size 1200-1450 and Y also lives in that town?  </s>
<s> Still slim, but it gives example that the probability can change rapidly, given new information.  </s>
<s> How would you model that he is trained to do the kind of work the company does, and no one else in town is hiring for that kind of work?  </s>
<s> Then from the earlier bird examples, you can then be explicit with it's a healthy , adult, eagle, thats in the wild, etc. Adding information can up your probability for this instance of bird.  </s>
<s> Then someone can postulate that the eagle somehow got trapped in a cave and thus can't fly;-  </s>
<s> Yes and thats why I think people will need tools to help guide people fill in and make more explicit things we normally take for granted.  </s>
<s> I also think that in some places we need people to place in vague answers for some things as well.  </s>
<s> People also use tons of context, and are flexible in the face of new information.  </s>
<s> I think that the first entering of data will be tougher, but as we put more stuff in it can get easier.  </s>
<s> The machines can use consistency checks and heuristics to help guide the later data entry.  </s>
<s> Of course thats my hope.. maybe the exactness will turnoff people from dealing with it.  </s>
