<s> Hi, when I try to save a document (resulting from using the "make book" feature) with a full URL in the "Document location" field, the web server gets accessed (see server log: proxy unknown - [18/Nov/2000:04:23:23 +0100] "HEAD /prod/book.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0" 404 0 "-" proxy unknown - [18/Nov/2000:04:23:23 +0100] "PUT /prod/book.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0" 401 397 "-" but Amaya (version 3.2, solaris 2) doesn't ask me for a name and a password and instead complains of an error status value of -1.  </s>
<s> So, I installed Amaya 4.0 for solaris 2 and tried to use the "make book" feature, but Amaya crashes with "*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***"  </s>
<s> Let me know if you need me to do further tests.  </s>
<s> Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.  </s>

<s> Hello Bertand,  </s>
<s> Can you give me some URL or documents for reproducing the make book crash?  </s>
<s> Once I fix this, we can look at the PUT problem.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the URL.  </s>
<s> I was able to reproduce an error condition.  </s>
<s> The Make book function is written to work synchronously.  </s>
<s> However, the images of the documents were always being requested asynchronously.  </s>
<s> In some cases, it was possible to get back the images after the document context was destroyed.  </s>
<s> This could explain your crash.  </s>
<s> This bug is now fixed.  </s>
<s> There's a second bug as the images are not being shown in the resulting make book.  </s>
<s> We're working on this problem and hope to fix it soon.  </s>
<s> -jose btw, it's a nice tutorial :)  </s>
