Hi Chris, Hi WAI ER participants, HTML Tidy [1] incorporates A11y checks [2] like those in WAI AERT [3] and OAC [4] and as this seems relevant for a new ERT WG charter I would like to point you at today's end user feedback on these checks [5]. 
I am not sure what to tell the reporter, other than to disable A11y checks and ignore their presence, [6] summarizes my similar concerns on this matter. 
A number of these comments deal with the integration of A11y checks with other conformance testing tools such as a Validator. 
A simple example is a missing alt attribute for a img element. 
In a HTML 4.01 document the alt attribute is mandatory and if the A11y component additionally checks for it's presence you end up with two messages concerning the same issue which is rather undesireable. 
The same goes for target="_new", even though a DTD-only validator will not catch such an error, a tool with more sophisticated conformance checks will spot it, i.e., Tidy will emit an error for the attribute and then continue to state "new windows require warning (_new)" which is rather misleading. 
There is more overlap. 
For example, the W3C I18N GEO Task Force has states "Always declare the language of the page as a whole in the html tag", if we would add support for the technical report and check for it, we would end up to suggest adding a lang/xml:lang attribute for I18N reasons and again for A11y reasons. 
There are also differences in the reliability of the checks. 
Some have no reliability at all and all a tool could say is that some things require manual testing. 
Which is rather annoying for some users. 
Testing whether certain page elements have sufficient color contrast can be done rather reliably, whether the content of a alt attribute makes sense is much less reliable. 
What I want at some point is a generic site quality tool that integrates all sorts of conformance testing stuff, checking HTML syntax, embedded style sheets, broken links, I18N issues, A11y, whether the SVG embedded in the referenced Atom feeds meets the constraints of the specification, etc. 
Such a tool would not be useful if it reports lots of duplicate issues or confuses clear erros with possibly-maybe warnings. 
I would thus like to suggest that a that the possibilty (or ease) of close integration of ERT WG deliverables in or with other tools is listed as a success criteria for the WG. 
And if anyone has a good suggestion what to do in response to the bug report other than messing with the A11y checks I would like to hear those too :-) [1] http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

We wrote a bunch of patches for tidy, sent them to the lists and nothing happened I would not waist my time on this one.

Could you point me at some of these patches in the list archives? 
I am unfortunately not aware of such patches and I am sorry if they got ignored.. Forwarding this email to the guy who wrote the patches On Behalf Of Bjoern Hoehrmann Could you point me at some of these patches in the list archives?
