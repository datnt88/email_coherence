I tried to submit the form for access [1], but received an error: Access to "/etc/apache/conf/users" failed. 
No such file or directory Can someone look into this error? 
Also, policy [2] states User groups: Everyone can read annotations stored in this service. 
Anyone with an acceptable access id and password can post new annotations to the service. 
The following user groups have acceptable id's : (1) users with existing W3C member access password and identification, and 2) anyone with e-mail address that obtained a temporary identification from W3C id server. 
Is there a way to read annotations on annotest.w3.org without either (1) or (2), as suggested by "Everyone can read ..." above? 
My W3C member access password does not work. 
Am I correct to assume that I still need to submit the access request even though I have a W3C member account?

Oops, it looks like Eric's new code for supporting more parameterization of access databases leaked out into annotest.w3.org too soon. 
I looked at this for a bit, thought I saw the problem, but failed in my attempt to fix it. 
So we'll have to wait for Eric to get off a plane to look at it. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
bigger oops; it looks like we didn't actually describe the policy we implemented on annotest.w3.org. 
At present, even read access requires an id. 
We are likely to change the access policy for annotest.w3.org to permit read without supplying credentials but for right now (2) is required. 
For now you will have to obtain a second id. 
We don't yet have enough infrastructure to share authentication credentials between annotest.w3.org and www.w3.org conveniently. 
We're working on it (part of Semantic Web Advanced Development) but it's not yet there. 
Sorry about that. 
I was cleaning up some code and took it upon myself to clean up some directory after running my tests. 
Please let me know if you have any more problems. 
It has been the case in the past that the annotations server [1] and algae interface [3] did not require authentication when reading annotations. 
The policy may have been drafted to reflect that. 
However, I think it is more likely that the policy reflects the fact that anyone may go through the same account application process and, assuming I don't break the server again, get access to any annotations you make. 
I believe the distinction between unathenticated and authenticated, but anyone may have an account, is insignificant from a polity viewpoint. 
That is true. 
We have the ability to create a member server if there is general interest.
