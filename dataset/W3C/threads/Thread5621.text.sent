Part of the problem right now is that Software Patents are silly. 
Yes the W3C is right that they cannot do anything to change that. 
However, the community has at hand a perfect opportunity to make a statement. 
If all the browser software vendors decided to make one browser for the American market and another browser for the rest of the world, then the issue could settle itself. 
I am think this way because it reminds me of the RSA and the related patent messiness. 
This is not an attempt to exclude America, but if Microsoft and the rest of the browser vendors are left with no choice they are left with no choice... Christian Gross I don't even know where to begin arguing. 
This is not a possibility. 
-Jake Interesting.... Christian Gross Sorry, I just can't see this as a practical idea. 
I build business applications for Intranets, where I use MSIE exclusively as the client. 
As much as I love MSIE and all it's well supported technologies, this would wipe out many smaller businesses and ultimately stifle innovation. 
Down the road, I'm thinking the fall-out from this Patent case will equally affect MSIE and other more rigidly standard based browsers like Mozilla. 
But Microsoft is the only one with the resources for the new development that's needed - who's going to pay these other developers to collaborate on such an effort? 
Likely nobody. 
It's too obvious who would dominate the North American market - and the rest of the world would have nothing (or a patchy beta at best). 
I see this kind of approach as bad for everyone.

I am now under the impression that it was meant as a way to show the world (and more specifically, US lawmakers) that the current patent system needs work, and only as a poor solution to the actual plugin problem. 
His suggestion would effectively create two mutually exclusive and incompatible World Wide Webs. 
I think we can all agree that it's not a good solution from that standpoint, but that was the point of the suggestion in the first place. 
If you're asked to wash the dishes, and you don't like doing dishes, break some dishes. 
The person asking you to wash the dishes may rethink the original decision that you should be the one washing dishes.

Seems that so long as the code within your HTML documents is encapsulated within the document itself, you shouldn't be impacted. 
It's external code invoked by the browser from an HTML document that is at issue here.

I hear ya... But if you don't have any dishes left to eat off, how are you going to feed yourself? 
What about a move in the "opposite" direction? 
And deliberately ignore the ruling? 
Currently only Microsoft is being forced to comply, but I'm sure other Browser makers will follow. 
But nobody is legally forcing rulings on Web Developers like me - what we if we just don't change our code in protest? 
MSIE has the biggest market share - so the web would be broken, forcing many people to NOT download the newest Browsers. 
Would this potentially circumvent the ruling? 
This is how people speak out - and THEN maybe the legitimacy of the Patent Office would finally be called into question.

Exactly... Put some pain into the situation and then very quickly people will realize, oops this needs attention. 
Where the industry comes into play is that we agree ALL of us, Mozilla, Opera, Microsoft to say "Hey we are only following the law" My case in point is that with enough pressure by the industry EVEN strong encryption was allowed... Christian Gross As wonderful as this sounds, many websites are profit-seeking ventures, and I'm betting that most management bodies will tell their web developers to "screw making a statement and get our website online!" 
Also, there are way too many people out there that don't listen to us -- it couldn't possibly be an effective boycott. 
That said, I love the idea. 
-Jake yeah, but if the dishes are taken away from you in the first place you are still not going to feed yourself. 
This case in my point of view is the tip of the ice berg... Remember 500 million is not small potatoes... 
This will embold lawyers and potentially start a mess beyond all proportions. 
Think about how much of a mess liability insurance is in. 
Do we really want this? 
Ignorance is not an answer. 
It starts with the deepest pockets. 
Luckily many in the Open Source community see this and are with MS on this one. 
(Or at least that is my opinion from talking to people). 
It is a good step by MS talking to the community and asking for opinions. 
I think in a way the patent issue is a good way of moving towards the semantec web with Web Services and all of the other nice and neat things. 
There are plenty of neat things that could be implemented. 
However, in my opinion I think this answer requires a two-step solution. 
Breaking some dishes to stop this mess in the future, while in the background coming out with a "new" and "improved" web. 
Just letting MS take this in the stomach opens us the community up to further potential lawsuits even when the "new" and "improved" web has been created. 
Christian Gross You raise some excellent points Christian, Almost too many points to handle I fear. 
I agree, but my statement was more about defense than foregoing knowledge. 
Maybe I should have used the word "boycott" instead? 
I sure hope the OSS crowd gets the message. 
A brief look at www.slashdot.org 
on any given day just confirms for me that the anti-Microsoft crowd will fail to see this point because of their anti-vision (a.k.a. blindness), even after the Internet has been pulled out from under them. 
I agree completely. 
Since the Internet came along, and the beauty of it was realized, many industries have learned that they needed to adapt to survive - except the Patent Office. 
Patent Offices wants to keep everybody in the stone age of industry. 
If what Gandhi said is true, and I believe it is, that "You have to be the change you want to see in the world" - then the Patent Office's view of the world is a very frightening thing......
