<s> I continue to have serious problems with search and replace in HTML source files.  </s>
<s> Basically, I simply can't get it to work reliably.  </s>
<s> Yes, edit mode is on when this happens.  </s>
<s> I wish that were the problem (no edit mode) but it isn't.  </s>
<s> I just tried to find all instances of " tool " and do either a replace on request or an automatic replace, "in the whole document", such that the string becomes " page tools ".  </s>
<s> There were at least four instances of the search string in the file, but Amaya told me it couldn't find any.  </s>
<s> I've had this happen so many times that I simply give up doing this function in source code editing with Amaya.  </s>
<s> My text editor (jEdit) does this fine.  </s>
<s> I use Amaya for text composition, and leave source code alone.  </s>
<s> I don't really want to have this restriction.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions as to what I'm doing wrong?  </s>
<s> I'm using Amaya 8.3 on a Win-XP OS. t. Tom Cloyd, M.S., M.A., L.M.H.C Psychotherapist in private practice Spokane, WA, U.S.A: (509) 475-9617, (800) 841-4424 Governing Board, EMDR Resource Cooperative "EMDR Portal" website -- http://www.EMDRPortal.com  </s>

<s> Due to the coloration, the searched text is within 3 different elements " " "tool" and " ".  </s>
<s> To be able to do that we need to change radically the search algorithm.  </s>
<s> One other solution would be to remove the coloration on request.  </s>

<s> Having to understand that Amaya has some interenal mechanism for colouring source code that breaks its ability to search across colours is not very intuitive for users.  </s>
<s> I think a much better solution is to change the search algorithm so it can search across element boundaries and find text as it is rendered in a particular view.  </s>
<s> just my personal opinion Chaals  </s>
<s> Charles, Irene, and List: Irene - thanks for explaining to me why this problem exists.  </s>
<s> I "get it" now.  </s>
<s> Of course, the problem remains.  </s>
<s> *MY* problem is that I am wanting Amaya to do as much for me in the arena of web page source code development and management as possible.  </s>
<s> I love this program already for what it can do for me in this area.  </s>
<s> I'm slowly developing a suite of open-source software and procedures for web page development and management which I'm hoping I can then use to teach my peers in professional mental to develop and manage their own web pages.  </s>
<s> These are smart people who often are NOT particularly engineers by temperament, but who could truly benefit from access to the great power of the Internet as a content publication technology.  </s>
<s> If we cannot make the process more accessible for these people, they are relegated to being mere observers.  </s>
<s> This is a tragedy.  </s>
<s> The W3C needs, in my opinion, to give less time to developing elegant sophisticated technologies for things people are hardly doing at present and probably do not greatly need to do, and more time to solving this accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> I can live a long time without scalable vector graphics.  </s>
<s> I die tomorrow on the Internet if I cannot easily and quickly update the text content and format of my web page.  </s>
<s> Right now it's only relatively easy if I have access to a good WYSIWYG source code editor.  </s>
<s> I can pay hundreds of dollars for one (and I do own two copies of Dreamweaver) or I can use Amaya and a couple of other programs.  </s>
<s> I'm promoting the second solution, because it's simply a door more people will walk through.  </s>
<s> It's a more accessible solution.  </s>
<s> Part of web site management is being able to make changes across multiple lines of code (and yes, across multiple files) using a find and replace function.  </s>
<s> Right now, since Amaya doesn't reliably allow me to do this, I use the marvelous open source text editor jEdit (see SourceForge for the binary module), and it works fine.  </s>
<s> However, NO program I can find outside of Dreamweaver allows me to do search and replace **across multiple lines of code**.  </s>
<s> I *can* do this in jEdit as soon as I learn how to use regular expressions better than I can at present.  </s>
<s> In this area, also vital to web site management, Amaya appears to simply be "out of the race".  </s>
<s> But, as Charles points out, the need remains.  </s>
<s> In software development, history continually shows us that functionality tends to get developed before usability.  </s>
<s> It's rare for developers to carefully assess user needs and THEN respond directly.  </s>
<s> That, indeed, is the topic of concern (but with products, not software), for Jakob Nielsen's website column this week ( http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040315.html ).  </s>
<s> I know that this post has been wide-ranging and a bit tangential.  </s>
<s> But the point I have to make is that Amaya lives or dies in relation to the degree to which it meets user needs - unless, of course, it is "vanity software"--some kind of project done primarily to please its developers and offered to the world only as a second priority.  </s>
<s> To the degree that this is the case, IF IT IS AT ALL, it is not, of course, illegitimate.  </s>
<s> It's just a different thing, and if its what it takes to get the development to occur at all, then I personally can live with it.  </s>
<s> I do want to make an appeal, however, to the notion that there is something glorious about really being helpful to a group of people who in turn help other people.  </s>
<s> If Amaya helps ME help some of my peers to do their work better, then it's having a serious effect on this corner of the world, and this is no small achievement.  </s>
<s> To that end, I will continue to hope that this program gets ever better.  </s>
<s> I use it every day, and expect to continue doing so.  </s>
<s> I will soon be promoting it to an organization that has several thousand members, many of whom would love to have web pages but find the technology intimidating.  </s>
<s> I love what Amaya can presently do, and hope for continued development.  </s>
<s> I hope that improved search and replace functionality is part of that development, and NOW you know why I hope this!  </s>
<s> Irene, I continue to marvel at, and appreciate, your involvement with and contributions to this list.  </s>
<s> For that, and your excellent work on Amaya, I thank you.  </s>
