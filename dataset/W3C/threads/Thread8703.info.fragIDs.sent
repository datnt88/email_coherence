<s> It would seem that without canonicalization, the interpretation of IDREF and of URI="" can change from application to application.  </s>
<s> When an application reads an XML document, it will store different material  </s>
<s> based on whether or not the XML processor is validating, whether it understands namespaces, and how it decides to store attributes (whose order is application-dependent).  </s>
<s> When one uses an IDREF, I suppose this immediately implies a validating processor since ID's aren't supposed to work for non-validating processors.  </s>
<s> However, the other problems still exist.  </s>
<s> Within the identified element, how should the text be rendered for the digest algorithm?  </s>
<s> One change of attribute order destroys a signature.  </s>
<s> Also, IDREF is usually used in conjunction with URI="".  </s>
<s> URI="" is supposed  </s>
<s> to indicate the root of *this* document, but there is still not enough information to tell us how to generate the byte stream that will be digested.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, URI="" cannot be used alone since such a signature  </s>
<s> would break as soon as the signature value is added to the document.  </s>
<s> URI=""  </s>
<s> must be used in conjunction with either IDREF or an XPath transform.  </s>
<s> The XPath transform has already been fixed by requiring c14n as part of its processing.  </s>
<s> IDREF must either be similarly fixed, or simply throw out IDREF as being a redundant way of doing a fairly simple XPath transform.  </s>
<s> Finally, note that URI="" could be used in conjunction with a transform other than XPath, such as XSLT.  </s>
<s> The XSLT transform has not been modified yet to require canonicalization.  </s>
<s> Thus, URI="" may feed slightly different data to an XSLT depending on the application.  </s>

<s> This was only in conflict with John's idea of using URI and IDREF jointly to solve the problem above.  </s>
<s> Ah, when I read "The URI/IDREF attribute identifies a data object using a URI [URI] or IDREF [XML]", I assumed that the author intended an inclusive-logic 'or' whereas under Gregor's interpretation it is an 'either-or' or exclusive-or.  </s>
<s> The reason for my assumption that IDREF and URI would coexist is so that one could IDREF into documents other than the self-document.  </s>
<s> Note to editors: If exclusive-or was intended, then perhaps the word 'either' can be inserted to clear that up, and if inclusive-or was intended,  </s>
<s> then perhaps 'or both' can be appended.  </s>
<s> Still, assume that use of IDREF implies URI="".  </s>
<s> The point I'm making about IDREF stands, and the problem with URI="" can still occur.  </s>
<s> URI="" is problematic unless we assume that a c14n occurs between the processing of URI="" and digesting the final byte stream.  </s>
<s> When we have URI="nonempty", the understanding is that we will execute some scheme like http or ftp to  </s>
<s> obtain a set of bytes.  </s>
<s> However, URI="" has no scheme, so presumably the application is being asked to provide the document's bytes, and presumably it will do so in an application-specific way.  </s>
<s> So, like IDREF, the bytes corresponding to URI="" would seem to be application-specific, which is bad for interoperable signatures.  </s>
<s> Currently, URI="" cannot be used without some kind of transform to exclude SignatureValue.  </s>
<s> Since the XPath transform is currently written in such a way that W3C c14n is required, there will be no problems.  </s>
<s> However, it would  </s>
<s> seem that any transform (such as XSLT or Java) that takes URI="" as input will have a problem.  </s>
<s> This is why we must still consider the URI="" problem.  </s>
<s> One simple solution would be to eliminate all transforms other than c14n, base64 decode, xpath and xpointer.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, Andreas recommended that dropping SignatureValue should be done  </s>
<s> automatically.  </s>
<s> I would agree insofar as this is precisely what we did when defining XFDL's signature methodology.  </s>
<s> However, doing this automatic omission increases the number of signatures that will be created using URI="" but notransforms, which means no c14n, which means troubles of the type described above.  </s>
<s> Thus, it is probably a good idea to have the SignatureValue omission spelled out (esp.  </s>
<s> since the work of omitting SignatureValue must be done even if the document doesn't spell it out).  </s>
