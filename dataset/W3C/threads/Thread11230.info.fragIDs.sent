<s> What is the rationale for having it be optional?  </s>
<s> Even valid XML documents need not declare their XML versions.  </s>

<s> The version is only optional if the ?XML...? is omitted.  </s>
<s> Any document which announces it it XML has to have a version number XML-LANG [23][24][25]  </s>
<s> The question is when they should declare that they are XML, and IMO this is important.  </s>
<s> Suppose I get a doc "cml.dat" - from somewhere, without a MIME type: we have no indication of what the file type is.  </s>
<s> So, for WF docs we write: Most of us would agree that this is more useful than the first.  </s>
<s> The problem comes if we wish to re-use it - quite repsonsibly - in another WF document.  </s>

<s> There is a second ?XML...? in the entity.  </s>
<s> At that stage in the document it looks just like a PI. Admittedly it is in the XML namespace and (2.6) the use of PIs starting with XML in any way other than in the RedBook is an error.  </s>
<s> So maybe a draconian parser would quit at this stage - a pity.  </s>
<s> Any ?XML ...? PI encountered within an element may be ignored by the parser.  </s>
<s> This would help re-use of DTD fragments.  </s>
<s> Later it might even be put to constructive use.  </s>
<s> It could also check on incompatible versions of XML (e.g. a VERSION 1 parser would not like to find a VERSION 2 fragment embedded - I hope the reverse would be allowed :-) P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences  </s>

<s> In VRML, failure to put the header with version will cause the world to die a draconian death.  </s>
<s> So, folks do deal with it and editors put it in automatically.  </s>
<s> Interesting bit, it is actually a required comment.  </s>
<s> BTW: the VRML experience is one to look at where a minimalist language uses "parse or die" tactics.  </s>
<s> When casting about for XML pro/cons based on "experience" one will do well to remember HTML isn't the only framework language out there.  </s>
