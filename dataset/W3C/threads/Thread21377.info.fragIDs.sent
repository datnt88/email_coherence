<s> Hi everyone,  </s>

<s> still interested in that implementation because I'd like to change the  </s>
<s> perl modules to run against a PostgresDB instead of MySQL.) But I didn't get very far - I'd didn't have a lot of time.  </s>
<s> I'd like to spend this weekend reviewing recent developments, other server implementations, the mozilla plugins, etc. Would some of the more active memebers mind posting links or other resources, pointing to various servers, etc.? Obviously, the w3c site is my starting point to jump back in, but other material would expedite the process.  </s>
<s> Basically, I'm issuing a call for anything annotation related that people have found helpful/interesting.  </s>
<s> If it's enough material, I'll through something together; else, at least we'll have a thread in the list archive.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Richard  </s>
<s> Richard, And if you draft it into a document, I can put it on the Annotea site too, so that other people can profit from your survey :) -jose  </s>

<s> r:RDF xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#" xmlns:d="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"  </s>
<s> Says at the triple level is: Predicate Object So "the thing in the about" "Annotates" "http://example.com/some/page.html"  </s>
<s> and "the thing in the about" "body can be found at" "http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754text"  </s>
<s> So at one level it's just a label, you don't even need it at all (when in RDF it would just be a blank label), however it's also a URI you can GET, and if you do this, you'll probably get the original annotation RDF - so if you have the RDF somewhere use that, or you can use some unique URI simply as a label - I don't see the point of that though here.  </s>

<s> Yep, this comes from the Dublin Core Namespace, they define in, in RDF you use the most popular namespace you can find which says what you want,  </s>
<s> so Annotea doesn't invent its own "words" for title, it borrows it from  </s>
<s> Dublin Core.  </s>
<s> The RDF primer at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ may well be helpful to understand these issues.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> Is the namespace identifier omitted on the attribute because it's the same namespace as the element itself?  </s>
<s> (e.g. r:type resource="" but a:annotates r:resource="" )???  </s>
<s> So that's the annotation by itself rather than the list context returned as a response to a query, right?  </s>
<s> 'Though if the query only returns one annotation, these will be the same...???  </s>
<s> Thanks so much, like I say I'm new at this and your descriptions have really helped.  </s>
<s> That explains perfectly why it wasn't in the annotea definition.  </s>
<s> I still think that where the protocol documentation gives example annotations, the title element should be shown.  </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll read that.  </s>
