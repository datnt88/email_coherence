Hi there, today I have downloaded ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-2.4-1.i386.rpm for installation on a friend's PC. 
After the installation I was a bit disappointed to discover that the Italian dialogues 
are not present. 
As I believe this was not intentional I dare to ask: why not package amaya-2.4-2.i386.rpm with the Italian files in? 
Thanks a lot, Roberto

Hi Roberto, We effectively forgot to add these files in the source tar file. 
That will be fixed in the next release. 
Meanwhile could you get them from a binary distribution. 
By the way, as you can see in the current release, Amaya on Windows 
platforms needs specific dialogue resources for each different language. 
These resources were not added in the previous release and many dialogues are missing when you use an Italian Amaya version on Windows. 
We plan in the next release to implement a generic mechanism for the Windows dialogue and to use the same dialogue files for Unix and Windows. 
I guess it will be easier to add a new dialogue language in the future.

Hi, I'm an undergraduate student in the US who's designing a new web language as a thesis project. 
The idea is to write a very simple, HTML-like language which facilitates web page layout (an alternative to the complex and not always completely effective tables and frames of HTML). 
I'm hoping to implement this language with Amaya. 
It looks to me as though most of what I'll need to do is rewrite the HTML S, P, and T files as well as html2thot.c. 
Does this plan sound feasible? 
Am I missing any obvious problems? 
Do you know of resources that might be helpful to me? 
Any and all advice would be much appreciated.

Did you look at at the new XHTML profiles and modules. 
I guess it's very close to what you plan to do. 
The plan sound feasible and you must have a look at the developer's corner in Irene. 
Hi, I'm adapting amaya to work with my own XML language and I'm having a problem with images. 
I've added a PICTURE terminal element to my S file and put an entry in the element table for my language in fetchXMLname.c that maps img tags to the PICTURE_UNIT element. 
After processing an img tag and successfully creating a PICTURE_UNIT element I set the text content of that element to the file name of the image source. 
When I run amaya and load a page with an image, no errors occur but the image does not appear. 
When I force the PICTURE_UNIT to have 200x200 dimensions in my P file and load the page again, I can see a bitmap with the word "picture" and a rectangle and a circle in grey and white, but my image still doesn't appear. 
Do you have any suggestions of things I may have forgotten or done wrong? 
Thanks.

The Thot library needs to have a local copy of the image file for being able to display it. 
Have you seen the code in Amaya/amaya/HTMLimage.c that does this part of the work.
