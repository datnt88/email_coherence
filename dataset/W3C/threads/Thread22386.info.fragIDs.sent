Is there a compact way to create a DOM subtree from a string containing marked-up text ? 
I am looking for a call similar to IE's insertAdjacentHTML. 
I think it is very useful and practical to have such a call in DOM 2. 
I know that we can achieve the same thing with a bunch of createElement, createAttribute, createTextNode and appendChilds. 
But it is very practical to be able to append a string containing markup. 
User agents can be easily optimized to create this subtree much faster than by doing individual calls to create the whole subtree. 
What do you think ?

There is no such thing in the DOM at this time, but loading and saving a document is at the top of our list of things to do for DOM Level 3. Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, DOM Activity Lead - 
insertAdjacentHTML. 
Unfortunately, a standard interface to parser operations is not in DOM Level 2. I agree that it would be very useful and practical to have this, and hope to see it in Level 3. Mike Champion
