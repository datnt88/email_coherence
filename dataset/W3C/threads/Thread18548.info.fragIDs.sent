<s> Hello, I finally read the glossary of the 23 March 2001 draft [1].  </s>
<s> I don't have any significant complaints (and will make a few minor editorial clarifications in the next draft).  </s>
<s> Two points caught my eye that I wanted to mention to the WG. 1) The definition of "documentation" reads: "Documentation refers to all information provided by the vendor about a product, including all product manuals, installation instructions, the help system, and tutorials."  </s>
<s> This sounds too normative to me.  </s>
<s> Our documentation *requirements* are expressed by Guideline 12.  </s>
<s> Those five checkpoints make requirements about (1) what must be in the documentation and (2) the accessibility of the documentation.  </s>
<s> I think the definition needs to be written in a manner that doesn't suggest that it adds requirements (e.g., that the vendor is required to write tutorials in order to conform).  </s>
<s> Also "all information provided by the vendor about a product" is far too broad.  </s>
<s> This might include press releases, TV commercials, etc.  </s>
<s> As for other features, the claimant may decide to include or exclude different pieces of documentation based on whether they conform.  </s>
<s> The only *required* documentation is that required by the checkpoints of Guideline 12.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I propose the following change to the definition: "Documentation refers to information that supports the use of a product.  </s>
<s> This information may be found in product manuals, installation instructions, the help system, tutorials, etc. Documentation may be distributed; it may be delivered on CD-ROM or available on the Web.  </s>
<s> Refer to Guideline 12 for information about documentation requirements.  </s>
<s> 2) We define "document source view" but we don't use it in any of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 2.2 says "provide a view of the text source."  </s>
<s> I propose to leave 2.2 as is and to delete "document source view" from the glossary.  </s>
