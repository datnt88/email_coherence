<s> Hello, Based on some comments from Eric, I've attempted to clarify  </s>
<s> the definition of active element.  </s>
<s> The key clarifications are:  </s>
<s> 1) Content determines what is an active element.  </s>
<s> 2) The state of the user's interaction with the document may  </s>
<s> limit which elements are active (examples are given).  </s>
<s> 3) Not all user interactions involve active elements (e.g., text selection and copying to the clipboard).  </s>
<s> 4) The role of "active element" is subject to applicability.  </s>
<s> The full definition follows.  </s>
<s> - Ian  </s>
<s> An active element is a piece of content with associated  </s>
<s> behaviors, that the user may trigger (or, "activate") either through the user interface or through an API.  </s>
<s> Content always determines what constitutes an active element.  </s>
<s> For  </s>
<s> instance, the HTML 4 [HTML4] specification defines a number of active elements: links, image maps, form controls, element  </s>
<s> instances with a value for the "longdesc" attribute, and element  </s>
<s> instances with scripts (event handlers) explicitly associated  </s>
<s> with them (e.g., through the various "on" attributes).  </s>
<s> The role  </s>
<s> of an element as an active element is subject to applicability.  </s>
<s> The state of the user's interaction with that content may limit  </s>
<s> which elements are active.  </s>
<s> For instance, an element may be "deactivated" by a script as the result of the user's interaction  </s>
<s> with the content.  </s>
<s> Or, an element may only be active during a given time period (e.g., during part of a SMIL 1.0 [SMIL]  </s>
<s> presentation).  </s>
<s> Or, the user may be viewing content in "read-only"  </s>
<s> mode, which may deactivate some elements.  </s>
<s> The user may interact with content without necessarily activating  </s>
<s> active elements.  </s>
<s> For example, selecting an element's text and  </s>
<s> copying it to the clipboard is clearly user interaction but does  </s>
<s> not make that element an active element.  </s>
<s> (The element may also be  </s>
<s> an active element, but only by virtue of how the author has  </s>
<s> encoded it, not by virtue of the selection functionality provided  </s>
<s> by the user agent.)  </s>
<s> The consequence of triggering an active element depends on the element.  </s>
<s> For instance, when a link is activated, the user agent  </s>
<s> generally retrieves the linked Web resource.  </s>
<s> When a form control  </s>
<s> is activated, it may change state (e.g., check boxes) or may take  </s>
<s> user input (e.g., a text entry field).  </s>
<s> See also the definition of  </s>
<s> event handler.  </s>
<s> Most operating environments use the content focus to indicate which active element will be triggered on user demand.  </s>

<s> I find some aspects of this confusing.  </s>
<s> The statement "Content determines what is an active element" makes one  </s>
<s> wonder how the word content is being used.  </s>
<s> Is it correct that since  </s>
<s> "content" is what is in the DOM, then the DOM holds all the information that  </s>
<s> this definition says determines whether an element is active or not?  </s>
<s> One ambiguity is that it is hard to tell how you are using the term "active"  </s>
<s> in this description.  </s>
<s> One the one hand, the term seems to be used to mean  </s>
<s> "activatable" (via triggering), such that an "active element" is one that  </s>
<s> could (under some circusmstances) be activated.  </s>
<s> The description make one  </s>
<s> wonder if an active element is one that is not only activatable but is also  </s>
<s> in its active state; for example, what does it mean to "deactivate" an  </s>
<s> element: (a) to turn an active element into an element that is _not_ an  </s>
<s> active element (i.e., from triggerable to untriggerable) or (b) to change an  </s>
<s> active element from its active state to its inactive (though still  </s>
<s> triggerable) state?  </s>
<s> I think that this needs to be clarified.  </s>
<s> Also, from the description it is not clear why the notion of "applicability"  </s>
<s> is relevant.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> The set of active elements (always based on content) may be reduced  </s>
<s> by the state of user interaction with the document.  </s>
<s> Note that in the future, users may be able to specify behaviors through style sheet-like content, I assume allowing them to override author-specified behaviors or to simply add their own.  </s>
<s> But this would still be content.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> We don't use the term "active" in the document to mean that  </s>
<s> an element is in its active state.  </s>
<s> I am comfortable adding that clarification to the definition.  </s>
<s> However, if you think that that the term "active element" might be confusing, we might use "interactive element" instead.  </s>
<s> PROPOSED: Change "active element" to "interactive element".  </s>
<s> As usual, this is about what the user agent can recognize.  </s>
<s> While  </s>
<s> this principle is globally relevant and defined in the section  </s>
<s> on applicability, I don't think it hurts to remind people in critical  </s>
<s> places that "what is X" depends on whether X can be recognized.  </s>
<s> So I mention that being an active element is a "role" that is  </s>
<s> subject to applicability (since one of the applicabilitly provisions  </s>
<s> refers to recognizing the role of content).  </s>

<s> So.... Old (IJ):  </s>

<s> But what happens when an interactive element is deactivated?  </s>
<s> a.  </s>
<s> Is it simply no longer an interactive element?  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> Is it still an interactive element that has had its behavior undone?  </s>
<s> c.  </s>
<s> Is it still an interactive element, but has been put in a state of readiness for triggering?  </s>
<s> Maybe answers to such questions are not essential but do seem necessary given that the present definition refers to deactivation:  </s>

<s> EH: I guess we would need to make clear what major specs say that we would interpret as declaring some element as interactive and then make clear that in this document we mean elements that have _both_ characteristics.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, someone might interpret these characteristics as alternatives, either of which could qualify the element as interactive.  </s>

<s> Comments at CMN  </s>
<s> CMN I think the above is really clear and helpful.  </s>
<s> CMN I found the second paragraph extremely confusing.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell the User Agent in fact is the ultimate determinnat of whether there is a behaviour associated with an element.  </s>
<s> As it is pointed out, there may be one  </s>
<s> sometimes, due to the user agent playing around with scripts.  </s>
<s> And I don't understand what the applicability reference means.  </s>
<s> I suggest just removing this paragraph.  </s>
<s> CMN I thought this was useful clarification.  </s>
<s> But it is not clear whether the User Agent is responsible for making sure that things which are sometimes  </s>
<s> active can always be navgiated to or not.  </s>
<s> CMN I don't think these two paragraphs add much more than bulk to the definition.  </s>
<s> CMN I thought this was a definition of what focus was.  </s>
<s> Is it meant to be that?  </s>

<s> Or does it simply implement or not implement the behaviors specified by the author?  </s>
<s> In the same vein, the user agent ultimately determines what the user views, but the user agent doesn't just make up content.  </s>

<s> - Ian  </s>
<s> Well, in this sense active elements come from the authors understanind of HTML, but that isn't the definitive characteristic.  </s>
<s> The definitive characteristic of an active element is the fact that it has behaviour associated with it.  </s>
<s> There may be a constraint that this does not include behaviour that is generated by the User agent, but I think this is wrong.  </s>
<s> Example:  </s>
<s> A user agent constructs an outline view of a page, by extracting the headers.  </s>
<s> This is represented as a seperate page, that can be navigated to with a  </s>
<s> standard command.  </s>
<s> (Lynx does this all the time.  </s>
<s> Amaya does it too, but always  </s>
<s> opens a new window.  </s>
<s> Mozilla composer does it in the same window.  </s>
<s> The representation, not the outline view, is what I mean is implemented).  </s>
<s> In addition, the user agent adds linking behaviour to these items, which links them to the coresponding point in the original document.  </s>
<s> I would argue that no behaviour is specified by the content, and that the user agent has attached the behaviour.  </s>
<s> As a technique for implemnenting a requirement of UAAG.  </s>
<s> I agree that we do not expect user agents to just randomly add behaviour to content elements.  </s>
<s> I just disagree that this is therefore what defines active element.  </s>
<s> I took an offline action to propose a definition.  </s>
<s> I am going to do that using the wai-xtech list, so that the people looking at the glossary can get it - this term will I presume go into the glossary in whatever way UA defines it in the first place, but there are a few other people that may have helpful insights if needed.  </s>
<s> (Like "shut up charles, you're talking rubbish", or something... grin/ ).  </s>
<s> My proposal will of course come back to the UAAG group at large, I hope in the next few days.  </s>

<s> Why do you say that the user agent has attached the behavior?  </s>
<s> The definition says that what is active is determined by content, not the author.  </s>
<s> If the user agent implements the navigable outline view in HTML, then HTML links define the behavior.  </s>
<s> What is the format that the user agent is using to implement this outline view?  </s>
<s> Where does the user agent store the fact that selecting a particular entry links to an original location in the document?  </s>
<s> In this case, the user agent is the author of the content, but the content still is where the user agent (as user agent now, no longer as generator of content) locates the linking semantics.  </s>
<s> - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> The outline behavior Charles describes is not defined by the author or specification, but by the user agent.  </s>
<s> I therefore don't think this is content in the sense that we have been using the term.  </s>
<s> It seems to me this is just a different view of the author supplied content and it may or may not be synchronized or linked to another view generated by the user agent.  </s>
<s> In general we want to encourage the use of specifications, rather than convention for defining whether an element is active or not.  </s>
<s> The more user agents make up there own behaviors the more people will use them, breaking interoperability that the W3C and WAI in particular would like to promote.  </s>
