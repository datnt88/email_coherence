<s> I welcome the various sets of guidelines on accessible web pages, even if some are contradictory!  </s>
<s> What we do not seem to have, however, are sets of real example good and bad web pages.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking in terms, say, of running a course in accessible webpage design and providing real web pages (need not be anything large!) as examples of both.  </s>
<s> One thing I get confused about myself is TABLEs.  </s>
<s> Bobby pretty much frowns on tables alltogther but many sites claiming to be accessible use them.  </s>
<s> I do not find tables much of a problem with Lynx myself.  </s>
<s> I understand the problems with using a left hand pane of a table as a list of quick links - mainly, under Lynx these popup first and make it awkward to get to the content quickly.  </s>
<s> So, examples are what we need so we can say, 'no, look at this - this is the way to do it.' Anyone know of any?  </s>

<s> I agree that Lynx straightens out the problem of tables that are used for layout, as long as they have br tags in those large columnar cells.  </s>
<s> But blind people, for a variety of reasons, are using more browsers than Lynx nowadays.  </s>
<s> If you use a Windows screen reader with Netscape, or with the plain vanilla Internet Explorer, and probably Opera, tables will be displayed as tables.  </s>
<s> This is a fine thing for things like bus and train schedules, because it puts individual data items in separate cells, which can be painstakingly examined with your screen reader's mouse movement commands.  </s>
<s> But since you don't know in advance how wide each of the columns will be, most screen readers can't parse the screen and read you, for example, just the center column of news.com or EE Times.  </s>
<s> Because the text is written to the screen one column at a time, a setting to have the screen reader "speak all" as it comes in will read the columns in order, but subsequent reexamination of the screen will be on a line-by-line basis, jumbling the columns together.  </s>
<s> When a screen reader such as Window-Eyes or WinVision works with I E 3.02 and its Active Accessibility component, the screen reader does some parsing of the HTML and gives you the Lynx experience once again.  </s>
<s> In W.E. you can turn AA off and see the page in its default configuration when you need to.  </s>
<s> Jaws for Windows 3.2, as I understand it, uses style sheets, the PowerToys app, and accessibility settings in I E 4.01 to create its own "reformatting" of web pages.  </s>
<s> I don't know what PW Webspeak or the W3 browser do.  </s>
<s> I think that the lack of Alt text, clickable server-side image maps, and the gratuitous use of scripts that make your screen reader/browser uncontrollable are three of the biggest accessibility problems facing totally blind web surfers.  </s>
<s> Frames and tables come in the second tier.  </s>
<s> As we move closer to high-bandwidth, high-impact, dynamic pages, who is in control of the timing will become more and more critical, as well.  </s>
<s> Lynx's handling of the Refresh directive is instructive for this part of the problem.  </s>
<s> I think the pages of the Library of Congress are not a bad start.  </s>
<s> You can find exhibits where scanned images were not put through an OCR engine or retyped.  </s>
<s> You will not find any D links anywhere.  </s>
<s> But if you're after information, you're likely to find it, in my opinion.  </s>

<s> Style sheets are the better answer, though, and it will be good when more of the web surfing population gets browsers that support style sheets.  </s>

<s> Explorer 4 supports a fair bit of CSS1.  </s>
