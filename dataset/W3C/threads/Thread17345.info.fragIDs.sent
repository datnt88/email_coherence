<s> I need the user to supply several bits of information, some of which are mandatory.  </s>
<s> My question is how can I do so that it is presented in an optimal way for screen readers?  </s>
<s> For sighted users, I usually denote this with an asterisk.  </s>
<s> Additionally, I would like to do away with the table headers (the items in the th tags).  </s>
<s> Is there a way of coding them so that they can be read by screen readers but not seen by sighted users?  </s>
<s> Here is the cut-down code for the html.  </s>
<s> Thank you for any help, I have been struggling with this all norning.  </s>

<s> How about using the title attribute of the form fields?  </s>
<s> Example: input type='text' id='foo' name='foo' size='32' maxlength='64' title='Enter your value for foo here; this field is mandatory' tabindex='99' / For testing, Mozilla displays these titles as a 'tooltip'.  </s>

<s> Are you using the table just so you can have a column to indicate whether the field is optional or not?  </s>
<s> You could hide the table headers best by not using them to begin with.  </s>
<s> Use CSS to line up the input fields if needed.  </s>
<s> Enclosing a form in a table can be problematic if you need users to navigate the table in table mode and enter information in forms mode.  </s>
<s> Switching back and forth is possible, but a pain.  </s>
<s> Regarding the indication that the field is mandatory, I assume that you tell sighted users what the asterisk means.  </s>
<s> Keep doing that and make sure that the asterisk is in the label.  </s>
<s> On top of that, using the title attribute is a good idea.  </s>

<s> How about avoiding that - what, after all, does an asterisk have to do with something being mandatory ?  </s>
<s> I'd suggest something like: input type="text" value="" styled to fit with CSS, naturally.  </s>
<s> You might want to fill in a suitable value, but I'm not going to re-open that debate.  </s>
<s> The above should work just as well for sighted and non-sighted users, as well as anything inbetween.  </s>
