<s> Charmane &amp; WSTF, I had an idea after the EOWG meeting today.  </s>
<s> Remember we talked about an illustration of the "components" of Web accessibility?  </s>
<s> What if the graphics on the home page were an artful arrangement of (some or all) of the components* (which themselves were artful, nothing like the straw illustration I mocked up:)?! By artful arrangement, I mean they wouldn't have labels or arrows or have to be in a same setup as the components illustration.  </s>
<s> They could be clickable to go to the intro page for that topic.  </s>
<s> That way the graphics wouldn't be totally gratuitous (which makes me much more comfortable :).  </s>
<s> Also, we could include the graphic on its intro page to further reinforce the idea &amp; have some consistency.  </s>
<s> ~ Shawn * that is software/tools/computers/technology: Authoring tools, Evaluation tools, User agents, Assistive technologies, Underlying technical standards; and people: Content providers, Users  </s>
