Hi, WSDL V1.2 [1] introduces the concept of message patterns. 
What are the differences between message patterns and message exchange patterns (MEP) [2] introduced by SOAP 1.2 Recommendation? 
IIf they are the same, I am wondering why are they called as message patterns? 
And, am wondering if the WSDL working group will use the template [2] spelled out by SOAP 1.2 Recommendation for describing MEPs?

For instance, you may wish to compare the following discussion of message  exchange  patterns with the introductory text of WSDL 1.2 Part 2 If you find this issue subtle, you're in good company. 
A task force within the Web Service Description working group has been working to clarify the issues. 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/me ps-vs-iops.htm 
We chose a different name because there were differences. 
There is no intention to do so currently, but that may change pending the investigation by the task force mentioned above. 
Thanks for writing! 
--Jeff Thank you and I am glad that a task force is looking into this. 
I'll follow their proceedings.
