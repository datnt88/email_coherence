I'm on linux / kde and it seems to work perfectly fine except that I'm unable to open location / document (when I type nothing happens except for some numbers who get # no matter what). 
I can type anything in the editing windows tough. 
What should I do? 
Thanks -VOAZ 
First, try to release the Num Lock key.

Hi, I've the same problem. 
I am using KDE and a french keyboard, and when I type something in field "Adresse" or "Title" nothing appear for most of the key. 
(a appear as ?, z as  ...) PS: that is not a capslock, or numlock problem !
