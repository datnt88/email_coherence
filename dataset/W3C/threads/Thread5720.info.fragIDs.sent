<s> Hi, working on an OWL editor/species serializer I'm a little bit confused about using rdfs:Literal for DatatypeProps.  </s>
<s> The S&amp;AS doc [1] mentions dataRange ::= datatypeID | 'rdfs:Literal' but in the reference doc [2] the rdfs:Literal option was removed from the WD in the august 2003 CR version (After comments from RDF Core IIRC).  </s>
<s> The "Parsing OWL in RDF/XML" note [3] seems to ignore rdfs:Literal as well, but I'm not sure on that.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the validators from Manchester [4] and Pellet [5] both complain: Mindswap, Pellet: "Non OWL-DL features used Manchester/Karlsruhe, OWL Ontology Validator "Undefined Datatype: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"  </s>
<s> The vOWLidator at http://owl.bbn.com/validator/ is fine but I don't know if it does species checking.  </s>
<s> I guess it's too late for doc changes but thought this issue might be of interest.  </s>
<s> (will send a copy to www-rdf-logic as well).  </s>
<s> Maybe this is not an issue at all (a rdfs:Literal range for a datatype property doesn't really add information..), but I wonder how to "translate" an rdf:Property with rdfs:range=rdfs:Literal to an owl:DatatypeProperty with rdfs:range=??. Simply drop the range?  </s>
<s> Or can I keep it because the validators are just incomplete and the rdf/xml is DL-ok?  </s>
<s> thanx in advance, benjamin Benjamin Nowack Kruppstr.  </s>

<s> Benjamin, Thanks for your comment.  </s>
<s> There is a distinction in OWL between a data range and a datatype.  </s>
<s> As RDFCore pointed out in their review of Reference, rdfs:Literal is not a datatype.  </s>
<s> So, it was removed from the list of datatypes but added to the list of valid data-range specifications, see start of Sec. 6: OWL allows three types of data range specifications: * A RDF datatype specification.  </s>
<s> * The RDFS class rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> * An enumerated datatype, using the owl:oneOf construct.  </s>
<s> This is in line with the S&amp;AS grammar rule that you quote (which is the OWL Lite one, so it leaves out the enumerated option)..  </s>
<s> You do not have to drop the range, as rdfs:Literal is a valid value for a range specification of an OWL property.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps,  </s>
