I still use Amaya for editing most of my web pages, and for some browsing, but am very disappointed with its usability and stability. 
I especially like its different "views" of a document. 
Pity this feature (and most of the interesting others) do not work as they should... :-( Jos? 
The fact is that Amaya does neither browsing or editting in any useful way has led me to retreat to writing with a simple editor and then using tidy to clean up any errors... for example standard cutting/pasting of a line is to position cursor at front of line then select using SHIFT-END oh but it doesnt work in amaya and in the last couple of days the method for changing headings to lists and viceversa was so convoluted it made my head spin. 
why not just learn the codes, tag up with TextPad , pass thru tidy and be done with it... viewing can be with several browsers that are in common use msie/netscape/opera and more reflective of the real world.... only reason i still check amaya once in a while is to see if they will ever get mathml working .... i live in hope ;-[ ;-[ John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or J.

Cruz --- jmcruz@fe.up.pt --- Why they don't work as they should? 
What I meant was that Amaya's attractive features cannot be used as they should: with confidence! 
This is related to the (little) stability, robustness and maturity of the code. 
For instance, keeping the "multiview" example: I should be able to update a link in "link view", or in "structure view", change a format in "structure view" or in the "main view", etc. 
The problem is: sometimes the whole thing works, sometimes, it does not! 
Often, Amaya crashes; many times, "link view", you position the cursor in the correct place, start deleting something, and when you look again to the screen, the cursor is deleting text somewhere else, and not in its original place!, etc., etc. 
Most of the key shortcuts do not work, so I have to use the menu; sometimes when I press CTRL+LEFT, there is a crash; when I change a (not so large) table, the whole image becomes garbled, but I dare not refresh the screen (because sometimes I loose my previous work), so I save first, hoping that everything is alright, and then refresh, etc. etc. Look, I do not want to sound ungrateful! 
I am grateful to the Amaya team to put forward the ideas and some code for us to work on. 
The problem is the the code is not yet usable with confidence (although the current version is 5.2, not an alpha!): Amaya does not behave as it should! 
We are given a glimpse of features we would like to use, but cannot! 
Just that! 
I still have not had the courage to start using version 5.2, because at the moment, I cannot afford the time to spare discovering the good and the bad "features/bugs" of that version. 
And I am eager to try the GTK release!... 
I would gladly contribute to Amaya if I had the time and the knowledge. 
Unfortunately I lack both. 
But I have not given up using Amaya, just yet! Regards to the Amaya team. 
Keep stabilising!

Hi Jos?, This is a more constructive message but you have to know that we need a precise description of the context where the bug occurs to be able to reproduce and fix them. 
In the "structure view" and the "link view" elements and attributes are displayed. 
That could explain why sometimes the cursor skip to another place, but it could be a bug too. 
Please give us a more precise context to detect if it's a bug or not. 
We'll try to improve the edition of tables.
