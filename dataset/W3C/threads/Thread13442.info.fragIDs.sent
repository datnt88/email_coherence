<s> [1] There is currently a thread started by Dan Brickley called, "'Semantic Web Accessibility'?  </s>
<s> - notes on XSLT and Schematron-RDF."  </s>
<s> Has everyone downloaded and played with the Schematron?  </s>
<s> I think everyone should.  </s>
<s> It raises interesting questions like: 1. instead of writing a "prose" document like the ERT, should we create a schema (basically a set of rules) like he has already done for WCAG?  </s>
<s> [2] 2. we have talked briefly about a technique that would use RDF to keep track of what tests a site/page has passed.  </s>
<s> Could we build on the schematron for this? 3. In Dan's original post [3] he says, "XSLT has great expressive power that can be easily applied to extracting / summarising and analysing XML web content into an RDF-processable form.  </s>
<s> Progress with this, for semantic web and WAI efforts, might be made easier if we had some taxonomy of XSLT stylesheets, so that an RDF agent could select appropriate stylesheets according to task at hand."  </s>
<s> If our tools summarized the analysis into an RDF-processable form, then data could be shared between tools.  </s>
<s> This has also been discussed on the list.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?? Ideas for discussion at the Face2face?  </s>

<s> I would use a persistent RDF database for keeping track of what has been rated.  </s>
<s> I would like to have something working reasonably well to demonstrate this - the stuff at http://www.w3.org/1999/11/11-WWWProposal/atagedemo is a first attempt, but I need to code up some of the rules better.  </s>
<s> There is no reason why the report tool can't have an RDF bit added to it that provides fodder for the database.  </s>
