Nir is right - MAP, by allowing block level content, can provide a navbar in an identifiable block-level construct which we can style at will (more or less). 
Do User Agents which implement MAP with Block level links provide the Text of the links as they would the ALT text of AREAs? 
This would provide backward compatibility missing with AREA as well. 
Example: (there are more in the HTML 4 spec [1]) Page content P Site navigation: 
A HREF="elsewhere.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="30,0,60,10" Elsewhere /A 
(provides an imagemap at the top, and a text navbar at the bottom.)

Nir, my question was not about how it should be done - it was clear that you had carefully read the spec, and you are quite right that it can be used trivially without an IMG or OBJECT. 
(although if it is an inline then presumably it should go inside, rather than outside, the P . 
Actually it seems strange that it be an inline element at all.) My question was whether, in the case where it is used with an image, the content of A elements is rendered in the same way the the ALT value for AREA elements, which would make it a very useful way of doing things. 
It would address some of Gary's concerns about link redundancy, the concerns about having proper ALT text available, the concerns about backwards compatibility, and provide the ability to jump links at the beginning, all in one go. 
(What I am suggesting here is that the Page Authoring Guideines suggest that ALT text for an image map declare that the links are reproduced below, by means of a MAP (as Nir suggested) and that in the UA guidelines it require that content of A elements which are part of a MAP be rendered as ALT text for the relevant regions. 
Thus settling all (I think) the concerns which are raised by Client-side Image maps, asking for less redundancy (which is a good thing) and providing a solution to the problem originally raised which works now (unlike the other elegant solutions we had thought of) and which is an elegant solution.

If the MAP is the content of an OBJECT and the image of the OBJECT is shown then no (alt) text is shown. 
If the MAP is outside the OBJECT, and its content is block level elements then the content of MAP is shown even when the image is shown and used as an image map. 
The spec. 
says you can duplice navbars this way. 
That is, put an OBJECT with usemap at the top, its content may be a link to the navigation bar at the bottom, and the MAP is written at the bottom. 
I was actually claiming that one can use MAP without any associated image. 
This is trivially supported by all browsers: they render the MAPs content. 
Those who (will) support image maps with block in MAP should render the content as well if there is no image associated. 
For example: P A href="some.html" some link /A | I put the MAP in a DIV as MAP is inline and not allowed as child of BODY in HTML4.0 strict. 
There are no coords or shape attributes as there is no image associated anyway. 
The MAP has a name because it is required by the spec., but has no function in my imageless image-map proposal... My point is that since there is no NAVBAR element, MAP is the best substitute.

to follow up on what Charles McCathieNevile said: 
Assuming that the user has turned image display off, and that the browser does indeed display the MAP contents as an ALTernative to the image, how does the audio visitor skip the group of links? 
Or in a legacy browser, how does the audio visitor having been told that there are links at the foot of the page, move to the head of that link group? 
For a truly elegant solution what we are missing is the pseudo-css:display="minimize" ability for a client-side policy to direct that the map image be replaced with a link to where the MAP content is already occurring in the text flow. 
Linkname: Property index URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/propidx.html Linkname: 'display' URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display 
Taking Nir's example however, it would still seem necessary for the first link to act as a "bypass" link by referring to a target at the start of the main body of the document. 
For example: a href="#maintext" Jump to start of text /a a href="index.html" 
Home Document /a /h1 This is the solution which Al proposed in last week's teleconference. 
In practice, one would use style sheets etc., to control the presentation of the navigational links. 
OK - what I am thinking is as follows: A user stylesheet (this relies on CSS2): [USEMAP] { display : none } MAP, .nav 
{ position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100px; top: auto; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; } (which positions a MAP, or anything of CLASS nav at the bottom of its containing block) Or another possibility: MAP { display : none } [USEMAP] { position: fixed; width: 100%; height: 100px; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: auto; left: 0; } (This fixes the imagemap at the top of the screen, as if it were a frame) Working with the following HTML: IMG SRC="map.gif" 
USEMAP="mymap" ALT="Imagemap - links repeated at end of Page" A SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,100,100" HREF="some.htm" Somewhere /A | A SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,100,200,200" HREF="other.htm" Otherwise /A | A SHAPE="rect" COORDS="100,0,200,100" HREF="else.htm" 
Elsewhere /A (This example is mostly copied from the HTML 4 Specification[2]) I have not, for the moment, included Al's suggestion of naming the start of the Map. 
Unfortunately, IMG doesn't allow ALT text to be active so there is no way to get to the NAMEd point except guess work. 
A better way to do this would be to use the content of the OBJECT element, but we're still waiting for UAs to support that in a stable implementation so I'll hold off on that example. 
What I think this technique does: Provides 'redundant' links for UAs which don't support USEMAP. 
Enables users to avoid redundant links if they have a fancy browser. 
Allows text-only users to have clustered navigation links at the end of the page, with access to them from the start of the page (via the MAP - see how Lynx implements imagemaps for an example) in current browsers. 
What I am not sure of: In a fancy graphic browser, where there is an imagemap with AREAs, and ALT text is provided for the AREAs, I get a tool-tip telling me what the ALT text is. 
I assume that this information is available to a screen reader. 
If I had enlarged the image (for example in Opera) to see it better, and it was using the example above, would the UA make available in a tool-tip or similar the content of the Links (in my example Somewhere, Elsewhere, Otherwise), and/or would it make that available to 3rd party technology. 
If it doesn't, should that be a technique included in the UA guidelines?
