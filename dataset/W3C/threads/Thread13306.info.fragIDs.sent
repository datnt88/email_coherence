<s> The er working group needs our input on a number of issues.  </s>
<s> I've attached a summary of main issues to date.  </s>
<s> I'd like to arrange a teleconference to proceed.  </s>
<s> Please post to this list your current thoughts on the issues listed below and any other important issues I omitted.  </s>
<s> Also, please send to me kasday@acm.org  </s>
<s> (*not* to the list) what times are good are bad for you for a teleconference on and after Oct. 26.  </s>
<s> Len Here are issues that have been discussed on this list (in chronological order)  </s>
<s> 1. The web report form.  </s>
<s> Last message to this list was Daniels's draft form is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report  </s>
<s> - Do we as a group have consensus that this is a useful tool?  </s>
<s> - Do we have additional suggestions for improvement?  </s>
<s> - Is there a way to test some of the concepts with users?  </s>
<s> - In addition to sending reports to webmasters, should reports be made public?  </s>
<s> 2. Bottom Line evaluation.  </s>
<s> see e.g. David's comments at - What are minimum requirement for "pass"?  </s>
<s> Is starting point a count of requirements passed/failed?  </s>
<s> or is starting point something like .  </s>
<s> "usable with Lynx"  </s>
<s> 3. Textual Equivalents This concerns tools that try to supply ALT text and other text equivalents when they are missing from web page.  </s>
<s> Daniel's features are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv.htm - How can we determine value of various approaches?  </s>
<s> e.g. apply by hand to "typical" pages?  </s>
<s> 4. Audio browsing simulators e.g. Al's note at - What would value of this tool be?, e.g. compared with viewing via Lynx?  </s>
<s> - Feature design?  </s>
<s> 5. Tables.  </s>
<s> According to comments from some folks in Peterborough, tables cause major difficulty once alternative text is taken care of, since the spatial organization of tables conveys information.  </s>
<s> Recommendations for browing tables in the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> e.g. in the working draft Can we provide some of this functionality to people using current day browsers?  </s>
<s> (I'll be giving some suggestions on this in subsequent email) Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA  </s>
<s> Concerning textual equivalents: Two more attributes that may used for creating textual equivalents are ID and CLASS.  </s>
<s> Clearly ID with higher priority since it is document-wide unique.  </s>
<s> In regard to the NAME attribute, it is not defined for IMG in HTML4.0 (or any other W3C/IETF spec.)  </s>
<s> It is used though to address the IMG element by client side scripts in older browsers who do not recognize ID.  </s>
<s> Ofcourse it may be used to create a textual equivalent by a program that recognizes it.  </s>
<s> Nir Dagan Assistant Professor of Economics Universidad Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Spain) website: http://www.nirdagan.com  </s>
<s> ID ok, but class seems far fetched.  </s>
<s> yes, my mistake, AREA too is missing it, I guess because they have ALT.  </s>
<s> that raises the question of whether this technique document should be limited to what's standard or what's useful  </s>
<s> As you noticed, I'm now leaning toward a "stepped" version of the report.  </s>
<s> I also maintain a open-issue page for this report form:  </s>
<s> I think so.  </s>
<s> probably more coming in  </s>
<s> yes, a trial with this forum for instance.  </s>
<s> I think so.  </s>
<s> I want to use a simple w3c public mailing list where reports are cced and where webmaster and reporters can discuss their points.  </s>
<s> Whatever tool is going to use these techniques should make its best effort to offer as many choices to the user as possible without damaging/loading the setup interface.  </s>
<s> One should be able to select what default operational mode is desired and then select alternative/override techniques as it moves on.  </s>
<s> My student Eric has been working on a TABLE linearizer and I hope to come up soon with a demo online.  </s>
<s> You can read some ideas about it in http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin.txt  </s>
