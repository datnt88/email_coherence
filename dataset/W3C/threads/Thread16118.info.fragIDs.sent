<s> Members will be aware that by far the majority of the w3c site is text based.  </s>
<s> For non readers with cognitive disability, it comes close to being a paradigm or inaccessability.  </s>
<s> I wish to draw the attention of all of you to this deficit.  </s>
<s> The code for a(ny) site is textual and essential, however if we all had to read and understand this before visiting a site, no one would bother.  </s>
<s> Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method.  </s>
<s> This system has a very ancient precedent QED.  </s>
<s> quad erat demonstrandum, or what was to be shown.  </s>

<s> It is difficult enough to penetrate the methods used by experts. 2 I have been asked offline to help identify games sites that are w3c accessible.  </s>
<s> I consider this to be virtually impossible, however without specific examples it is nonsense.  </s>
<s> first demonstrate what you wish then explain.  </s>
<s> W3C desperately needs to simplify its goals and practice what it is preaching.  </s>

<s> It is *already* prose vs. the EBNF declaration that is the primary resource for such information) So far, our element declarations have dealt with sub-elements that must occur; that is, none have been optional, nor have they explicitly been able to occur more than once.  </s>
<s> In order to indicate a sub-element's optional or recurring status, you need to add an occurrence indicator to the element declaration.  </s>
<s> Occurrence indicators are single character symbols that appear immediately after the generic identifier name or sequence of names.  </s>

<s> The reality for this example may be the same as that initial reaction.  </s>
<s> Note that this exercise doesn't even begin to address the issue of why a child needs to understand occurance indicators within element declarations in an XML DTD, or why a technical discussion is obligated to make such information "understandable" by anyone who may come across it.  </s>

<s> An attempt (I'm really too tired to do this justice, and not skilled enough, but I believe that it can be done.  </s>
<s> When we make something, there are things it has to have.  </s>
<s> This is what we have done so far.  </s>
<s> We can also make something with things that it might have.  </s>
<s> We have to show which things have to be there, and which are the things that might be there.  </s>
<s> We can do this with a marker like "?".  </s>
<s> In this example of a sundae, icecream and whipped cream have to be there.  </s>
<s> The fudge and caramel are in brackets "(" and ")" We have to have something that is in the brackets.  </s>
<s> But because there is the marker "|" between them, we know that we can choose which one we want.  </s>
<s> But we can have nuts, or not have nuts. the "?" marker with the nuts lets us know that it is something we can have but don't have to.  </s>
<s> ( I have assumed from the context that the general notation had already been explained, and that I have understood it more or less correctly.  </s>
<s> I wrote that straight off in two minutes as an immediate reply.  </s>
<s> It is clearly possible to increaase the accessibility of such a concept dramatically.  </s>
<s> It seems that there is a continuum of accessibility in this area as in others.  </s>
<s> We should be aiming to capture as much of that continuum as possible, and the factors that influence our decision will include our own ability, the cost of providing the benefit, and our own perception of the audience.  </s>
<s> Two of these factors rely on us to make the effort to know better, and one of them is an external constraint on how much we are prepared to do, both in learning and in carrying out the necessary tasks.  </s>
<s> I feel that there is a mutual obligation.  </s>
<s> Those of us who claim to know about accessibility, and to provide skills in this area, are obliged to refine and further our skills.  </s>
<s> Those of us who have expertise, particularly in an area where that expertise seems rare, or the necessity for it seems poorly understood, need to spread that expertise.  </s>
<s> There are clearly strategies which can be used to improve the accessibility of a website to people with cognitive disabilities - the use of illustrative images, language which is as clear and simple as possible in the circumstances, the addition of multimedia presentations which reduce reliance on text as the only method of communication, all have a part to play.  </s>
<s> Likewise, the use of images and sounds as an aid to accessibility needs to be handled with care to ensure that it does not get in the way of accessibility for some other group.  </s>
<s> Again I would draw attenetion to the needs of people who are deaf - sound is not particularly cvaluable to them, but images and movement are, since many of them are "illiterate" in their primary sign language and therefore have to learn a second language represented in abstract symbols without the benefit of having learned how to use abstract static symbols.  </s>

<s> The concept is accessible already, according to WAI guidelines.  </s>
<s> I still don't accept that accessibility automatically equates to "understandability". (Must I understand the symbolism in a Picasso to have it be accessible to me?) The question still remains: While the language was simplified, does it still impart the required technical information for those who need to use it in that manner.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, it does not -- because important terms and definitions have been removed in favor of "understandability".  </s>
<s> The new sample does not define an "occurance indicator", a term that must be used for clear an concise communication about DTDs.  </s>
<s> Nor does it appropriately label items such as the generic identifier name.  </s>
<s> So even though someone might understand that when we make things, it must have other things, and this thing we're calling a sundae may not have nuts, the sample has not done what it was supposed to do: Define and demonstrate the use of occurance indicators that are placed on generic identifier names -- a critical skill used in writing DTDs.  </s>
<s> The original assertion in this argument was that the W3C site must be written in a manner similar to your sample in order to have any credibility in discussing accessibility.  </s>

<s> Put another way -- having the Pratt-Whitney jet engine repair manuals written at a third grade level might be "good" so that they can be understandable to anyone who might want to pick it up -- but if that results in enough loss of specificity that an error is made by a mechanic who met his job requirement of understanding college-level material but must use a third-grade level repair manual, simply because the language explaining what a foo is and how it was supposed to be inserted into the widget was too general -- and that error results in the loss of a plane in a crash.......then we've "understood" ourselves into disaster.  </s>

<s> Ah. it appears I misunderstood what was being conveyed.  </s>
<s> It is clearly possible to give the jargon name for the things I described (this kind of marker is called...).  </s>
<s> And I agree that a description of a Pratt-Whitney Jet engine which failed to convey the right information is wrong.  </s>
<s> I think the issue here is what the boundaries of accessibility are.  </s>
<s> If I heard the question about Picasso in the normal course of conversation then I would answer yes- that I think it is precisely when you understand the symbolism of Picasso that it is accessible.  </s>
<s> And the deeper an understanding you have, the more accessible it is.  </s>
<s> Accessibility is about understanding.  </s>
<s> It is very difficult for a blind person to understand an image, and very easy for many of them to understand some "equivalent text", particularly in the context of searching the web for information.  </s>
<s> Think about the challenge of making a painting by Rothko (who does big squares of colour - for example all rust red with variations in shade and hue and tone) to a blind person.  </s>
<s> Or even to me.  </s>
<s> If I never saw Rothko paintings again my life would probably not be very different, since they are inaccessible to me already.  </s>
<s> But if somebody could explain to me what was interesting about such a painting, then they would make a difference to me.  </s>
<s> In terms of making a particular site more accessible, there are things we can do.  </s>
<s> Just as there are with accessibility for people who are blind, deaf, have motor disabilities, etc there is a whole continuum of accessibility for people with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> There are a corresponding range of things we can do, from providing multimedia presentations of the material on a site which are designed to teach deaf children with learning disabilities, step by step, how to implement an XML parser, to making our writing style clearer and providing more graphic illustration of the ideas we express.  </s>
<s> Although I think the WAI guidelines are very good, I do not think that meeting the guidelines is proof of accessibility.  </s>
<s> The phrase I use is that meeting the guidelines would make a "rebuttable presumption" - which is a term that a lawyer told me.  </s>
<s> It means if you do what the guidelines say, then you can say "I think I have done it right", and people should have to show you what you did wrong.  </s>
<s> But if you don't do something in the guidelines, then that is something wrong.  </s>
<s> In the original example, I would suggest that it does not follow two checkpoints - the one about writing clearly and the one about illustrating.  </s>
<s> Both of these are P3 in the current guidelines, and it has been suggested by Anne, Dave and others that these are in fact more important than P3 in the context of learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> I look forward to learning more.  </s>
