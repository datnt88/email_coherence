The Evaluation Description Language could also be used to carry repair information (requiring a name change, e.g. to Evaluation AND Repair Language, or EARL. 
For example, we've already decided that EDL would have statements that an image in a site has missing ALT text. 
We could add a statement that the particular ALT text should be added, e.g. a statement containing a pointer to an image, and the suggested ALT text, e.g. "underwater epoxy putty". 
The repair part of the language be used by people who consult on web sites to report not just accessibility but also the repairs they recommend. 
Or the statements could be provided by an independent service, e.g. as described in Daniel's ALT-server paper http://www.w3.org/WAI/altserv.htm. 
The independent service could be a web site simply storing repair information from volunteers as a public service. 
User agents, or other web based services, could incorporate the repairs transparently into the page. 
This could be useful to an organization such as a university that uses outside sites that are inacccessible but which the institution has no control over. 
Plus it could of course be directly useful to any individual. 
I'm thinking though that if institutions need it it could create a funding stream. 
What do you-all think?

I prefer easily pronounceable acronyms and also like the "repair" notion so long as it's (or seems to be) voluntary.

e.g. to Evaluation AND Repair Language, or EARL. 
EARL and URL sound the same to my ears. 
That's an invitation to leave me 
even more confused! 
Regards/Harvey 
We just officially deprecate URL so that the most important item on the Web makes a sound dedicated to Bro. Rubinsky and EARL is how people from Brooklyn and New Orleans refer to the famous OIL program. 
Confusion is good - it evokes pity and the young folks become more solicitous and polite. 
Love.
