<s> The Evaluation Description Language could also be used to carry repair information (requiring a name change, e.g. to Evaluation AND Repair Language, or EARL.  </s>
<s> For example, we've already decided that EDL would have statements that an image in a site has missing ALT text.  </s>
<s> We could add a statement that the particular ALT text should be added, e.g. a statement containing a pointer to an image, and the suggested ALT text, e.g. "underwater epoxy putty".  </s>
<s> The repair part of the language be used by people who consult on web sites to report not just accessibility but also the repairs they recommend.  </s>
<s> Or the statements could be provided by an independent service, e.g. as described in Daniel's ALT-server paper http://www.w3.org/WAI/altserv.htm.  </s>
<s> The independent service could be a web site simply storing repair information from volunteers as a public service.  </s>
<s> User agents, or other web based services, could incorporate the repairs transparently into the page.  </s>
<s> This could be useful to an organization such as a university that uses outside sites that are inacccessible but which the institution has no control over.  </s>
<s> Plus it could of course be directly useful to any individual.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking though that if institutions need it it could create a funding stream.  </s>
