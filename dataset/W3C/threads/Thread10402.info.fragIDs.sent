<s> This is the not so usual lately call for agenda items for a telecon this week.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure there is a lot to discuss.  </s>
<s> If there is no formal business to conduct, I'm going to suggest getting together at the usual time informally.  </s>

<s> An informal chat sounds like a good idea.  </s>
<s> The only formal thing I can think of is the MIME type registration.  </s>
<s> Further to [1][2], there have been no further comments so I think it may be timely to request RFC publication...  </s>
<s> I think the main question is whether we want to wait until after the PR "hearing".  </s>

<s> Hi Aaron,  </s>
<s> I can't make it.  </s>
<s> I'm going to schedule a telecon for Friday.  </s>
<s> Do you have input on the mimetype registration process.  </s>
<s> Would you be happy to request publication of the rfc?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> According to http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype we're supposed to wait until after the W3C specs go REC before publishing an RFC.  </s>
<s> Is that page out of date?  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz: http://www.aaronsw.com/  </s>
<s> in a word: Maybe.  </s>
