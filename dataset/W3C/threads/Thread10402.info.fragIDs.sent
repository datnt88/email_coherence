This is the not so usual lately call for agenda items for a telecon this week. 
I'm not sure there is a lot to discuss. 
If there is no formal business to conduct, I'm going to suggest getting together at the usual time informally.

An informal chat sounds like a good idea. 
The only formal thing I can think of is the MIME type registration. 
Further to [1][2], there have been no further comments so I think it may be timely to request RFC publication... 
I think the main question is whether we want to wait until after the PR "hearing".

I have a meeting this Friday (and next). 
However, I am in Cambridge, MA this afternoon if anyone's around and wants to talk f2f.

Hi Aaron, 
I can't make it. 
I'm going to schedule a telecon for Friday. 
Do you have input on the mimetype registration process. 
Would you be happy to request publication of the rfc? 
Brian 
According to http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype we're supposed to wait until after the W3C specs go REC before publishing an RFC. 
Is that page out of date?

in a word: Maybe. 
in detail: Reagle and I chatted about this recently... draft-freed-mime-p4-04 posted by DanC at 2003-11-26 19:14 (+) DanC: Internet Draft by Freed, Klensin October 20, 2003 DanC: IETF tracker status says "In State: Waiting for Writeup" DanC: see also TAG issue w3cMediaType-1 DanC: and How to Register a Media Type with IANA (for the IETF tree) I'm sure you can find the full text of the IRC logs.
