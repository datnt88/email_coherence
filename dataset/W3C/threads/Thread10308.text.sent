Working group member developers, We are in the process of assessing RDF implementation for drafting a directors decision and we need your help. 
Please run your code base against the test cases [1] and report your finding to w3c-rdf-comments as soon as possible. 
We need this in the next week. 
Please include in your finding the toolkit name and description. 
Describing your toolkits in RDF gets you bonus points :) [2] Please feel free to forward this request to other developers who are working on RDF toolkits. 
thanks for all of your help, --eric [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ [2] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/EO/usecases/tools 
I assume we shold be looking at for the tests to run. 
I have just updated the xml-sch-02 tex-01 and horst-01 Manifests as actioned last week. 
Please can someone rebuild the big Manifest. 
Jeremy Doing this tomorrow first thing.

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ Theory and practice _are_ the same thing. 
In theory. 
Thanks Jan, much appreciated. 
--eric The relevant Jena developers are out next week, we may be able to send some reports today and tomorrow. 
We are unlikely to give an integrated report - and it may well be of the sort like "we passed all the parser tests". 
Jeremy Hi Eric, This is a summary of the testresults with Euler for Euler is an inference engine supporting logic based proofs. 
It is a backward-chaining reasoner enhanced with Euler path detection and will tell you whether a given set of facts and rules supports a given conclusion. 
More details are at To parse the manifests and the test documents Jena 2 is used and we then just run the entailment tests. 
We assume that we PASS a test when: a proof is found for a PositiveEntailmentTest or no proof is found for a NegativeEntailmentTest seen as a PositiveEntailmentTest The results are: tests PASS FAIL PositiveEntailmentTest 21 21 0 NegativeEntailmentTest 22 17 5 43 38 5 (those failures are due to the fact that we have partial builtin datatype support and we have no means to switch it off) The detailed results are: #proofFound_RDF_PositiveEntailmentTest #PASS .

thanks for all of your help, --eric [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ [2] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/EO/usecases/tools Thanks Jeremy I appreciate the response. 
I talked with Andy S. today and he confirmed the same time. 
With regards to reporting, I'll take what you can provide. 
Short reports now with more detailed reports later are welcomed. 
Thanks again, --eric
