<s> Let's change perspective for a second.  </s>
<s> pi-calculus is mathematical model for looking for looking at certain things and drawing conclusions about them.  </s>
<s> It can cover a wider definition of processes than say CCS.  </s>
<s> And it has appeal because it can cover a wide spectrum of definitions from the more complex scenarios involving calculations down to the level of a single unit of processing (pi-caclulus also covers lambda calculus).  </s>
<s> Mathematical models provide forms of analysis and proofs, in this particular way through a form of calculation (hence the name calculus).  </s>
<s> By themselves they do not provide ways to construct things.  </s>
<s> If you want to construct a process defintion that you can exchange, monitor and otherwise manage, you would have to look at languages like BPEL, BPML and WSCI.  </s>
<s> If you want to construct a process definition that you can depict visually - and this is certainly an interesting thing to do - you would look at visual notations like BPMN and UML.  </s>
<s> There is no constrain on the things you can do or the type of tools you can use.  </s>
<s> What you get is the ability to pick the right tool for the job and use the formalism to draw conclusions about it.  </s>
<s> For example, you may decide on a tool that can only define bi-lateral choreographies because that happens to be your main interest at some point in time.  </s>
<s> The formalism will address that.  </s>
<s> At some other point in time you may want to go further and add multi-party collaboration, or you may want a tool that can show you the n-party collaboration along with your implementation process that takes part in it.  </s>
<s> The tool needs to be more sophisticated, and you need some formalism that goes both ways.  </s>
<s> pi-calculus is interesting because it allows that formalism to exist, and at the same time allow these variety of tools and languages to use that formalism.  </s>
