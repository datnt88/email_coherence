<s> Hi all, I have successfully configured jigsaw in order to allow PUTs in my working area.  </s>
<s> This is great but I would like to restrict who can do PUTs without having to force him/her to authenticate for accessing that realm.  </s>
<s> Can anyone point me in the righ direction?  </s>
<s> Or to the right manual page?  </s>
<s> Or am I trying to do something impossible?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Enrico  </s>
<s> Can you please remove my email from you Amaya group listing.  </s>

<s> Hello Enrico, You should configure jigsaw to authorize a PUT from a given IP address.  </s>
<s> I don't know if it's possible to say user x belongs to IP@ y in jigsaw.  </s>
<s> Many times, you just know that the IP@ is correct, but don't know who is behind that address.  </s>
<s> I don't know how to configure Jigsaw, so you should address that part of the question to the jigsaw public mailing list.  </s>
<s> I hope this helps you, -jose  </s>
