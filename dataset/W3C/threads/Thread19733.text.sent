Same situation as already reported by someone else, but I didn't see a solution . . . 
there is no '.exe' file in the win95\bin folder. 
There is a '.exp' file (is that significant?). 
Anyway, I am running windows 95 on an intel p5 with 16M ram (if you want to know) and downloaded the .zip 
file and unpacked it to C:\, as instructed. 
Thanks, Lee Thank you for your remark. 
There will be an executable for Win95 today.

The new Windows 95 executable still has the same problem as the Windows NT version did: it loads local files fine, but will not load documents with a URL. 
Additionally, it now gives the following dialogue box every time it is run: : Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library : Debug Assertion Failed! 
: Program: C:\THOT\WIN95\BIN\AMAYA.EXE : File: fopen.c 
: Line: 54 : Expression: *file != _T('\0') : [ Abort ] [ Retry ] [ Ignore ] I then have to press the "Ignore" button to use the application.

This error happens when you try to open a file with an empty string name.
