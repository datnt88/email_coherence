I try to install the annotea server but it doesn't work. 
I installed the perllib from cvs, a mysql database and the apache webserver on a linux system. 
After that i set the configuration files and tried to call the "annotate"-script with a normal webbrowser. 
But i got an error message "Internal Server Error". 
So i watched the log-files and found the following 2 lines: [Wed Oct 31 01:02:03 2001] [error] (2)No such file or directory: exec of /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi/annotate.cgi failed [Wed Oct 31 01:02:03 2001] [error] [client 192.168.0.10] Premature end of script headers: /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi/annotate.cgi 
On my command line i can execute the annotate script (with any user): linux:/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi # perl annotate.cgi 
(offline mode: enter name=value pairs on standard input) 
Is it possible to test the script offline? 
Are there all perllib modules installed right, if i can run the script? 
What commands are accepted from the script on the command line? 
I don't know where to search the error. 
If anybody has a solution for one of my problems please write me... Thanks Markus 
hi Just a guess, but could it be the path to Perl specified in the script differs from your local setup? 
#!/usr/bin/perl or whatever...? danbri 
The system we run here has no annotate.cgi. 
Did you rename annotate to annotate.cgi to make the server happy? 
I don't remember off the top of my head if there are hard-coded references to the script. 
There may be as it makes the code much simpler to read. 
If there are, I would advice changing annotations/cgi/annotate.cgi to annotations/CGI/annotate. 
Also, I notice that the annotations/CGI directory is instead annotations/CGI. 
Are you running this on a FAT partition? 
Can you exec it directly? 
linux:/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/CGI # ./annotate 
If not, you need to linux:/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/CGI # chmod +x annotate to make it directly executable. 
The best tool for debugging your problem is the error log, usually found in /var/log/apache/error.log. 
It will tell you why you got an "Internal Server Error". 
Once you are able to execute annotate, you will be able to see the results of the last run by typing linux:/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/CGI # ./annotate 
DEBUG but I don't recommend doing this before you have successfully run it once from a browser as it will create a file /tmp/annotate.log with permisions which will keep the web server from executing annotate. 
This log file needs to be writable by the user or group www-data. 
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 19419546 Oct 31 00:56 /tmp/annotate.log 
The DEBUG function is good for people debugging client-server interactions. 
Each response from annotate comes with a session-id. 
You can rerun any session with annotate DEBUG someSessionId or annotate DEBUG -4 to run the fourth session back.
