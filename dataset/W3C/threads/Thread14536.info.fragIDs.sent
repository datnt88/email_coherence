<s> A few month ago we were asked if we are addressing any physiological and cognitive disabilities in our guidelines.  </s>
<s> Whilst shmoozing over the weekend, I was alerted to (although confess that I know almost nothing about it) some such disabilities / cognitive disabilities that we may be able to do more for.  </s>
<s> Semantic pragmatic, is a disabilities were the person is unable to understand anything but the literal meaning of words.  </s>
<s> If you tell him not to look a gift horse in the mouth he will wonder what horse, and why he should do that anyway.  </s>
<s> The are unable to understand jokes sarcasm and metaphors and can be unable to distinguish a joke from literal conversation.  </s>
<s> They can be intelligent, just literal.  </s>
<s> The particular children who my friend was working with have a real problem with content, conversational and written.  </s>
<s> As authors try to make content more user friendly this content becomes less accessible to them.  </s>
<s> So I propose the following.  </s>
<s> The PF suggest that XHTML, ect create a new tag - non literal to enclose non literal comments (or a few tags such a joke metaphor sarcasm expression) that such people can render in a alternative color so that they can at least be alerted to the fact that this content is not intended to be taken literally.  </s>
<s> Then we could have a title or translation attribute were the author can say the literal intention of the non-literal content.  </s>
<s> E.g. nonliteral translation="going from bad to worse" out of the frying pan into the fire /nonliteral Just a suggestion.  </s>
<s> We need to get in touch with professionals dealing with this disability to ask their opinion.  </s>
<s> However more importantly there is a question, are we looking into helping all the disabilities that we can.  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>
<s> I think that there is a general trend in writing to be more colloquial and, well, fun.  </s>
<s> Take the way manuals have evolved, from the dry text books to the "machine code for dummies" stile of writing.  </s>
<s> Just take that fraise "for dummies" that is not literally intended.  </s>
<s> It probably means "made friendly".  </s>
<s> But all this is not the point.  </s>
<s> The question is, would such a checkpoint help.  </s>
<s> and should we make it.  </s>
<s> Again I know that example I made is not the ideal solution, just an example of a possible direction.  </s>
<s> The essence of the issue is - Is this a problem we need to address.  </s>
<s> And if so - let us do it.  </s>

<s> In general, placing rendered textual content into attributes is seen as bad design.  </s>
<s> It is preferable to make in element content, so that it can contain other markup (links, ruby, etc).  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> Text in element content (vs.  </s>
<s> attributes) is also very useful for translation.  </s>
<s> If I know that all of my element content is meant as human-readable text (and it's marked up with a proper xml:lang designation), then I can do automatic translation on it.  </s>
<s> If I have to worry about whether an attribute should be translated or not, or what language each attribute is in (note: there is no way in XML to indicate this), then translation is much harder.  </s>
<s> It's easier to translate this: Than this: (Why?  </s>
<s> Because in the first example I don't have to _know_ that certain attributes are human-readable; in the second, I have to have specific knowledge that alt and title are meant for people, and they're in English.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@reef.com  </s>

<s> Lisa, I puzzled over this until I remembered you are not in the US.  </s>
<s> The word "Dummies" is used for "Dumb People" as well as for store figures.  </s>
<s> There is not necessarily a movement from manuals to fun books, so much a broadening of the market to include more readers and users - those who find the manuals "inaccessible" ...  </s>
<s> If it won't help, we shouldn't do it.  </s>
<s> It would be a major chore for text authors.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could give it a first try.  </s>
<s> Talk to your friend who has these children as students.  </s>
<s> Prepare two web pages that her students have to read, one written with literary elements marked up and defined, the other with it just straight, and ask the kids which they liked better and why.  </s>
<s> If it needs to be done, it needs to be done in markup, which means it needs to be doable in Front Page, Word, and Word Perfect.  </s>

<s> I think colloquialisms are an issue (and it's one of those issues we share with internationalization/language translation), but again, I don't think they are most efficiently solved in angle brackets by the provider.  </s>
<s> 3.3 (Write clearly and simply) should encompass making an effort to avoid slang, cliches, and what have you.  </s>
<s> I think anything over and above that is more reasonable to do in the user agent.  </s>
<s> What's critical to explain to the writer is that they shouldn't assume that the reader has context, which is good advice for anyone writing for broad audiences.  </s>
