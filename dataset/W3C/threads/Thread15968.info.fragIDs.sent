I am looking for resources on accessibility concerns vis-?-vis email. 
Anyone know of any?

The use of non-standard character sets, of email which is marked up in HTML (or in fragmentary HTML syntax), and inclusion of information via attachments raise the same issues in email as they do in web content. 
So the only resource I can think of is the Web content guidelines, and documents which fulfil a similar role.
