Hi There, Did somebody know the answer ??? Do we need to C14N a reference before computing the digest ?? Regards -Nathan Do we need to C14N a reference before computing the digest ?? If you have a node set and you do not "manually" c14n by an explicit transform, the default c14n is applied which is (inclusive) c14n omitting comments. 
Christian Nathn, In general, whether or not you apply canonicalization depends on the type of URI and the transforms. 
Assuming no explicit transforms, if the URI="" or URI="#foo" where foo is arbitrary, then you will use canonicalization to create a canonical physical representation of the referenced resource. 
If the URI is NOT URI="" or URI="#foo", then no canonicalization occurs, the resource is treated as octets. 
That is, unless there is an explicit transform that requires the resource be interpreted as a node-set.
