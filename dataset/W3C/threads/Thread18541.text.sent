Time: 2:00-4:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, USA Call-in: Longfellow Bridge (+1) (617) 252-1038 IMPORTANT Please prepare for the meeting by reading the proposals listed below. 
A lot of time has been put into these proposals so that the teleconference itself can be as efficient as possible. 
You are also invited to comment on the proposals on the mailing list prior to the meeting. 
The goal is to send the document to last call in about two weeks, and we need to address these proposals as quickly as possible. 
Agenda 1) Review action items (listed at the bottom of this email) 2) Review proposals to address open issues Review of proposals a) I'd like to get confirmation of changes to the speech characteristic checkpoints of the 19 March 2001 draft (as announced: b) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9 c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I don't expect that it will be controversial.] d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be minimal requirement. 
Note: There is support for this proposal from Al and Denis. 
e) Checkpoints 3.2/3.7: 
Toggle placeholders off requirement: f) Executive summary (proposed by Eric) g) Refer to conformance proposals regarding content/ui labels, input device conformance, and conformance example. 
See also the proposal to address conformance through pointing device and voice input and the question at the end of the proposal about the shape of Guideline 1. 
I think this proposal subsumes Al's comments: h) Search termation. 
Refer to ideas from David: OTHER TOPICS: g) Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5. 
Al, can you say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t. system-captions? 
h) We need to add to the Techniques document for the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7. 
Additional techniques are welcome as well. 
Action item summary Open actions IJ: Coordinate usability testing of the guidelines (JRG volunteers to be one of the testers). 
Source: IJ: Write an executive summary appendix. 
Source: REFER TO PROPOSAL FROM EH: JG: Propose text for the techniques document about synthesized speech implementation issues. 
Notably UA and AT wanting to use the same synthesizer engine. 
JG: Create issue list for things that need to be addressed in the next version of the document JG: Take to WAI PF the requirement that formats need to provide a more precise means for specifying events (than HTML allows for). 
Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes JG: Create a wish list of other requirements not in UAAG 1.0, including those that might fall under this Guideline. 
Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes JG: Write up some techniques for checkpoints on scripts on/off about subsetting the configuration. 
Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes JG: Take to the WAI CG the question ofpursuing the DOM Views and Formatting module. 
Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes JG: Call Cindy King about formats that support separate windows for captioning information Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes GL and TL: Ask someone from Microsoft whether they will evaluate the guidelines with a product. 
Deadline: 2/1/2001 Source: CMN: Find out from SYMM WG whether repositioning of objects will appear in the spec (or should be in UAAG). 
Source: TL: Report to WG on discussions at Microsoft about keyboard emulation. 
Source: RS: Send pointer to information about universal access gateway to the WG. 
Source: Completed action items IJ: Take to the cross-WG WAI list the issue of how to refer to UAAG (or other WAI specs) in non-W3C documents Source: Email to CG: Completed action items available in 19 March 2001 draft IJ: Work on editorial changes to 2.9. 
Include an example (e.g., "alt" for IMG in HTML). 
Source: IJ: Add to the beginning of the document (limitations) that 3.1 doesn't cover layers. 
Source: IJ: Add to the techniques document that it's ok to render the unblinking text not in context. 
Source: IJ: Add to techniques to show images "temporarily" and when you leave the image, it goes away. 
Source: Proposed to drop: IJ: Add a Note to checkpoint 4.4.pointing to applicability provision about streaming and whether slow/etc.control 
enabled by the format. 
Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes IJ: This is already in the techniques document. 
Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Addition: Issue 468 [1]: The "at least a majority" minimal requirement needs review. 
Refer to Al's email [2]: On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the default key bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations. 
The group should reconsider this language. 
If the default key binding defines a full set of single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is _no way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key binding] to single-key bindings. 
Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key, or twelve-key device in use. 
You just can't get there from here.

Please explain more (e.g., rewrite the checkpoint). 
UAAG talks about functionalities first, and then makes requirements about the nature and number of input device bindings to activate those functionalities. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 There are two responses: 1. 
You only have a certain number of key so you are constrained in the number of single keyboard bindings to the number you have. 
2. The minimal set of functions that should be available is 11.4. 
PROPOSAL: 1. Can we just referrence checkpoint 11.4, rather than use the "at least majority" term. 
2. An alternative would be to say to allow any single key bindings to be reassigned to a single key binding without a modifier keys.
