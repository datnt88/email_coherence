<s> Perhaps someone here will be kind enough to help you, but in truth, http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com is _not_ a forum for asking questions about how to build web applications.  </s>
<s> www-talk@w3.org is often recommended, as are the large number of news groups dedicated to the topic.  </s>
<s> We've intended to have http-wg mailing list remain open even after the HTTP working group closes, in order to discuss issues and ambiguities with RFC 2616 &amp; 2617.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't want to see it become just another forum for general "how to" web questions, though.  </s>
