Thank you for your polite inquiry. 
Perhaps someone here will be kind enough to help you, but in truth, http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com is _not_ a forum for asking questions about how to build web applications. 
www-talk@w3.org is often recommended, as are the large number of news groups dedicated to the topic. 
We've intended to have http-wg mailing list remain open even after the HTTP working group closes, in order to discuss issues and ambiguities with RFC 2616 &amp; 2617. 
I wouldn't want to see it become just another forum for general "how to" web questions, though.

I am not sure whether my Q is relevant to this forum. 
But as I read all the Q's posted in it, I am seeking help here - 
My Question I have to run a dos .bat 
file as a cgi script in Microsoft Personal Web Server 4.0(I have HTML form's action set to this .bat 
file). 
How do I associate at the web server end, that .bat is an executable script ? 
When I submit the form, web server reports "MIME type not properly set". 
Basically it does,nt recognise .bat 
extension for execution.
