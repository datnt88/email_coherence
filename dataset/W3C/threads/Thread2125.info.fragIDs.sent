<s> Hi all, By now, most of you should have downloaded the new draft 01 of the HTTP/1.0 spec.  </s>
<s> If not, it is available at ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/ and or from any of the Internet-Draft archives.  </s>
<s> Our plan is to absorb as many comments as possible by August 18 and then produce a "final" draft by August 21 (final in the sense that we believe it to be complete and reflects WG consensus on all issues).  </s>
<s> After another week of general comments, we would like to submit it to the IESG as a Draft Standard (not Proposed, as said the minutes from Stockholm) if there exists a rough consensus to do so.  </s>
<s> In the mean time (between now and the 18th), I will be busy finishing  </s>
<s> the HTTP/1.1 draft.  </s>
<s> I would like to avoid getting too involved in the debate over portions of the 1.0 draft, except where it becomes necessary to describe the thinking behind some of the recent changes.  </s>
<s> In particular, I would prefer it if people would attempt to understand the draft without any recourse to the WG minutes, mailing list archives, or the authors, since that is the intended goal of the specification.  </s>
<s> By understand, I mean understand how you would implement each and every feature described in the specification.  </s>
<s> If you can't understand a section, please make a comment to that affect and hopefully the WG can propose specific wording that will fix the problem.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 Issues There are a few outstanding issues that I am already aware of after the weekend: 1) Content-Transfer-Encoding After discussion with the various camps, it appears as if the best thing to do is to simply forbid this header ever appearing in HTTP, and instead make it a requirement of gateways to do addition/removal of CTE when required by MIME.  </s>
<s> For HTTP/1.1, we can define a Transfer-Encoding header which has the analogous purpose, but without the MIME lossage.  </s>
<s> 2) Caching As far as I'm concerned, the 1.0 spec will not be complete until HTTP can be unambiguously cached.  </s>
<s> In fact, this is now possible given the additions of "Pragma: max-age=NN" and a complete syntax for the URI header.  </s>
<s> However, it seems clear that I will have to explain the algorithm for doing so as an appendix to the spec.  </s>
<s> It is also clear that we must require that servers mark content as being negotiated when that is so.  </s>
<s> The only alternative to the above is the complete removal and prohibition of any preemptive content negotiation.  </s>
<s> Not supporting caching is not an alternative.  </s>
<s> 3) WWW-Authenticate The new spec now uses semicolon to separate parameters -- keeping it as comma-separated would prevent people from using more than one AA scheme per resource.  </s>
<s> This will break existing implementations of Digest and PGP AA.  </s>
<s> One alternative is to leave WWW-Authenticate as a fixed field (i.e., only describe it for Basic), and define a new syntax for an Authenticate header.  </s>
<s> The same applies to Authorization.  </s>
<s> 4) Comments in Headers I personally believe it is easier to define and parse a generic syntax for all headers than it is to have a separate syntax for each defined header.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I have included the comments and \escape mechanisms of RFC 822 in the generic syntax.  </s>
<s> However, if the WG desires it, I can add the requirement that they only be allowed in those header fields which define "comment" as a possible field value, and then add that to User-Agent, Server, From, and Forwarded.  </s>
<s> Any others?  </s>

<s> Given the number of surprise changes and objectionable ones at that, I believe this is unrealistic.  </s>
<s> Let's go for the alternative.  </s>
<s> Breaking all existing implementations of something like this seems unnecessary.  </s>
<s> If you *must* go for semicolons, define a new header.  </s>
<s> Eric W. Sink Senior Software Engineer, Spyglass eric@spyglass.com  </s>
<s> Who said "like to" had to be realistic?  </s>
<s> Keep in mind that existing clients will not recognize the new header.  </s>
<s> That may not be a problem if both are provided, but will remain a problem for the Authorization field.  </s>
<s> Another alternative would be to forbid multiple schemes per resource, or require that applications parse the AA fields such that they can recover gracefully from unexpected folding.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the latter would be best for 1.0?  </s>

<s> (fielding@ics.uci.edu)  </s>
<s> The only thing is that I have been seeing multiple WWW-Authenticate: fields all over the net.  </s>
<s> If a server wants to inform clients that it will accept multiple authorization schemes for a resources, it really seems to be "current pratice" that the server include multiple WWW-Authenticate fields rather than one WWW-Authenticate with several semicolon separated entries.  </s>
<s> Does anyone else have any ideas about the WWW-Authenticate problem?  </s>
<s> I believe that this is a key issue if we want to see DIGEST authentication deployed.  </s>
<s> Alex Hopmann ResNova Software, Inc. hopmann@holonet.net on (note that I created the fragment ids by hand) is more stable.  </s>
<s> I will try to transfer the fragments to each version.  </s>
<s> When it becomes an RFC, I'll do a completely-hyperized version for posterity.  </s>
