<s> E-mail story javascript:void(0) Microsoft has applied for patents that could prevent competing applications  </s>
<s> from reading documents created with the latest version of the software giant's Office program.  </s>
<s> The company filed similar patent  </s>

<s> 1&amp;ontId=7343&amp;lop=nl_ex applications in New Zealand and the European Union that cover word processing documents stored in the XML (Extensible Markup Language) format.  </s>
<s> The proposed patent would cover methods for an application  </s>
<s> other than the original word processor to access data in the document.  </s>
<s> The U.S. Patent Office had no record of a similar application.  </s>
<s> Hi Richard, I think the following link is related: It appears Microsoft is trying to protect their Office XML "Schema" design.  </s>
<s> The Schema License is free, under conditions, so I think they're just trying to prevent "un-licensed" applications from reading and writing Office XML documents.  </s>
<s> Most XML Schemas and/or Vocabularies are free and open - to a point.  </s>
<s> Microsoft is probably just trying to make sure they're in charge of the Schema, and not another Office style application from other sources.  </s>
<s> Doesn't surprise me, I bet it's not too long before others (read: not Microsoft) take similar measures to protect their XML Schemas as Intellectual Property.  </s>
<s> XML is a method of representing information, much like coloured paint is for representing expression and images in a painting.  </s>
<s> You can't patent colours, but you can patent/copyright ownership of what you paint.  </s>
<s> Of course, I could be totally out to lunch...and not understand a word of what I'm reading.  </s>
<s> I'm a programmer, not a lawyer :-P  </s>
<s> Thanks for the link.  </s>

<s> What a novel concept!  </s>
<s> Who would have ever guessed that you could represent a word processing document file as an XML file.  </s>

<s> Scott, it doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> Even if you were a lawyer and in sync with your lunch order, you probably do not have the resources to indefinitely dispute their patent "claim", its a lost cause.  </s>
<s> The burden is one you to dispute the claim.  </s>
<s> The software patent system is screwed up, period.  </s>
<s> In my view, this Office XML patent only reinforces the anti-trust concerns the industry has and recently questioned again by the Justice Department.  </s>
<s> This does not help Microsoft in this regard.  </s>
<s> It hurts them.  </s>
<s> Also, off the top of my head, this essentially boils down to yet another a "bundling" concept.  </s>
<s> Microsoft recently lost or gave in to requiring Windows Media on the OS over others.  </s>
<s> In my view, Office XML patent enforcement is probably weaken by this recent Windows Media precedence.  </s>
<s> I see the same "bundling" concept being applied.  </s>
<s> I remember Bill Gates once saying when Netscape first sued Microsoft over IE taken over the market.  </s>
<s> He said in so many words: IE is winning the hearts and minds of the PC market simply because IE is faster and technically superior than Netscape.  </s>
<s> All someone has to do is develop a better IE and he will be highly successful.  </s>
<s> If he can do it, more power to him!!  </s>
<s> I encourage it!  </s>
<s> I have yet to see anyone take him up on that challenge.  </s>
<s> I think Gates still believes this is true with the growing thin client market that Office XML targets.  </s>
<s> Someone can develop a better, faster "thinner client."  </s>
<s> This XML patent preempts the high potential market opportunity of compatible and better thin "Office" clients thus stopping others doing to Office XML what IE did to Netscape.  </s>
