I ran a test on http://www.hwg.org/ at http://www.netmechanic.com/ 
today. 
They told me that I'd "misspelled" a lot of words, like XML and XHTML, plus they kindly informed me that !DOCTYPE is not a valid HTML tag. 
The thing that scares the heck out of the accessibility instructor within me is rating of our "browser compatability". 
The things it identifies as "incompatible" all fall into one of the two categories: (a) Style sheet support, such as SPAN elements or CLASS/ID attributes, which specifically degrade gracefully when CSS is not present, and (b) Attributes/elements added for accessibility's sake, such as IMG LONGDESC, HTML LANG, ABBR, or LABEL. 
Now, I don't mind being identified as "incompatible" with old versions of browsers, but the PROBLEM here is their "advice" to web designers: "Try to avoid using a tag or attribute if it is incompatible with more than 10% of your audience." 
THIS IS SO UTTERLY WRONG. 
Here's what they say for LONGDESC: Tag: IMG Attribute: LONGDESC Lines: 78 Visitors Affected: 99.00% Microsoft: 3: N 4: N 5: N Netscape: 2: N 3: N 4: N In other words, since 99% of browsers out there don't use the information, you shouldn't include LONGDESC. 
In short: Their advice is actively ANTI-ACCESSIBLE. 
Would someone care to join me in writing to these people about the inherent problems in advising against the use of proper HTML code as they are doing here? 
It might mean more if we all got together. 
This could also be an issue for the evaluation/repairs tools to look at, but I don't know what exactly you'd want to do.

Kynn, The issue of greatest concern is that their advice seems to be based on misunderstanding of how browsers work. 
To say that longdesc is incompatible with browsers is vague enough as to be misleading. 
To advise against using it on this basis is, as you point out, extremly detrimental to accessibility and in my humble opinion to the development of the web itself. 
I'll take a little time to compose a polite letter and make the points as clearly as I cn with appropriate suggestions and references, so I exect I'll send it some time next week.

The note should come from Len, and it should be an invitation to join in the ER IG where knotty issues such as what to do in a checker with un-implemented markup are being thrashed out as we speak.

Kynn &amp; Charles, The issue is the confusion between "incompatible" and "unrecognizable". 
Attributes and values can be unrecognizable in a particular browser, but have no negative effect on the rendering or the page in that browser. 
Another way to think of this is as an "and vs or" problem. 
What these validators are doing is checking to see if a tag or value is valid in all (or a majority of) browsers, rather than if it is valid in any browser.

Good idea Al, to use this as an opportunity to ask them to join us. 
I'll write a note after mellowing out a bit this weekend.
