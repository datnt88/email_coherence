Hello all, With the news that Len has passed, I find it hard to schedule a call to discuss technical issues. 
Instead, I would like to open up the call for us to share thoughts about Len and grieve. 
Anyone within the WAI community is welcome. 
His family and friends are arranging a memorial for him. 
We don't have firm details yet, but will pass them along as soon as we know. 
It sounds likely that it will be Friday 25 May at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA USA, but this is not yet confirmed. 
For the time being, I will continue to act as chair of the group. 
Call details: Monday 21 May, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910) Be well.

I plan to attend this memorial service for Len. 
He did so much for WAI, in particular WAI-ER. 
He led by doing. 
He created with joy. 
He guided with tact. 
He shared his experience. 
We are blessed by his enthusiasm. 
Len saw much more to be done. 
It is up to us to do it. 
Please, can someone accept responsibility for updating WAVE 2.2 Alpha, which addresses Section 508 requirements as well as WCAG. 
I'll try to find the proper contact for this. 
I note that 20% of the hits on the Temple Institute on Disabilities, where Len worked, are to WAVE and WAVE508: Check Len's website: There are good education references there, some of which should be added to the WAI set of references, and possibly to WEBAble: Regards/Harvey Bingham
