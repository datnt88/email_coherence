I have the 'amaya-src-1_1a_tar.gz file' (14mbytes). 
I then downloaded a copy of 'gzip.exe' from a gnu archive (116K, 20 Aug 1993) and invoked it in the same subdirectory as the .gz 
file as 'gzip -d -N amaya-src-1_1a_tar.gz' and what I got was a single file 33mbytes in size, it does appear to have source code in it, but it is all one file. 
What am I doing wrong? 
Please help me understand the procedure to uncompress this .gz 
file so I can get started understanding amaya.

amaya-src-1.1a.tar.gz is an unix archive file. 
Sources files are stored in amaya-src-1.1a.tar which is compressed by gzip tool. 
You have to get the tar tool and then use the following command to get amaya source files: tar xvf amaya-src-1.1a.tar 
In the near future, we plan to have a winzipped source code of amaya.

Greetings, 
The .tar.gz extension indicates that the file is both tarred and gzipped, so you need tar as well. 
With GNU tar, you can do % tar xvzf foobar.tar.gz without uncompressing it first. 
With conventional tars, do % gzip -d foobar.tar.gz % tar xvf foobar.tar

This is a resend of something I think I sent to the wrong place. 
It's been revised to note that long file names are recognized: The WinZip product from Nico Mak Computing, Inc (http://www.winzip.com) is perfectly capable of unzipping tar, zip, gz, tgz, gzip and Z unix compressed files. 
It understands long file names and directory hierarchies, and runs on both Win95 and Win NT. Winzip is freely downloadable for a 30 day evaluation. 
I'm not affiliated with them, it's just a great product. 
A win zip is entirely unnecessary and is generally bigger then the corresponding tgz file thus taking longer to download. 
I would MUCH rather have the windows make files thanks. 
Hi David, To build amaya, we need more than MSVC (other compilers developed by our team are required). 
When everything will be ready, makefiles will be given whith source code.
