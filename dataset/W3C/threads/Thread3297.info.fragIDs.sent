While speaking with Richard last week, he asked me to share some thoughts on the education and outreach part of our work. 
In our conference call tomorrow, we can start to discuss this in more detail. 
Currently, we are quite focused on the guidelines themselves. 
Does it make sense to start thinking about the education &amp; outreach part, or is it still too early? 
This will obviously depend upon the content being created. 
When should we start to define the medium or media within which we share this 
content? 
More importantly, will this influence the way in which we create the guidelines? 
Many web designers (at least in the US) typically use a site such as WebMonkey.com or Builder.com instead of W3.org. 
Such sites offer a quick overview (although not always completely accurate) of the most important 
aspects of a topic. 
They typically (in my experience) do not look to the 
entire guideline on the W3 site. 
Can we think about methods of ensuring that 
our deliverables are more easily approachable and more usable, so as to make 
sure that web designers come here first to get the most accurate set of guidelines? 
Richard shared with me the URL to the draft of the expert format. 
I think that's definitely a step in the right direction! 
Thanks, Phil Arko Sr. Human Factors Engineer Siemens Corporate Research User Interface Design Center Princeton, NJ, USA 
Apologies to all for my lack of participation over the past few months. 
Due to a series of curious events I was unavoidably detained. 
At any rate, I'm planning to attend tomorrow's call, and will be preparing the pieces I've had on my to-do list re. education and outreach prior to the meeting. 
As far as your question above Phil, my opinion is that it's -never- too early to work on this part of the picture. 
Stay tuned for a document or two, and I'll look forward to talking with you all tomorrow.

That's exactly what I thought of when I first heard of I18N GEO, make the authors and developers aware of issues, explain them and provide hints how to deal with them. 
It would be great to have Q&amp;A documents to point at at w3.org. 
For example, the W3C MarkUp Validator refuses to validate documents which do not explicitly specify a character encoding. 
Many authors don't understand why this is necessary or how to setup the web server to specify the encoding, it'd be great if I18N GEO would provide sole document dealing with such issues. 
I don't know that our documents need to be the sole document, but it would be a great idea to have tools like the validator provide a link to our documents when they report an error, such as missing encoding. 
The error could link directly to the section on encodings that answer the questions you identify as user needs. 
It's an interesting idea to prioritize having text for errors that are detected by these tools. 
Would make our web site both valuable and frequently referenced, and that would increase the visibility of other materials we produce.

I have also long wanted to look at the validator, add some i18n checks if/where needed, and provide useful hints and explanations for warnings and errors. 
Also HTML Tidy. 
This will get a lot of visibility and help us make a significant difference. 
Adding a Q&amp;A type area to the website also sounds like an interesting approach. 
For example, I'd like to provide some navigation into the current hints &amp; tips that started from some kind of Q&amp;A type format. 
(I think Q&amp;A is popular because when using it you are usually hoping to find an answer to a very specific point that you need help with - which fits very much into our philosophy so far of identifying and servicing the needs of the community, rather than just producing untargeted information blindly.)

Hello Tex, I think getting the validator to link should not be too difficult. 
Now we just have to provide the document :-). 
Regards, Martin. 
Martin, agreed and point taken.
