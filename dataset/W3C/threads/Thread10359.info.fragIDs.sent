I had an action from last weeks telecon to draft an RDFS document to replace the one at the end of the RDF namespace 
I have attached such a draft. 
It is a cut down version of rdfs.rdf with: 
- a new comment inserted to describe the document 
- the owl:ontology modified to the RDF URI - terms in the RDFS vocabulary are removed in the sense that they are not defined in this document 
It uses only syntax defined in M&amp;S, specifically, xml:base is not used. 
Ralph considered this important, at least until we get to rec. 
Differences from the document at currently at the rdf namespace URI are: - labels are included for all terms - the comments are consistent with those used in RDFS.rdf and the 
current specs 
- an Owl ontology element has been added 
- the list vocabulary rdf:List, rdf:nil, rdf:first and rdf:rest has 
been added - the rdf:XMLLiteral class has been added. 
- domain and ranges for rdf:value are specified for all properties 
- there is an rdfs:subClassOf property for all classes - there is an rdfs:isDefinedBy property for all terms

Thanks Brian, looks good to me. 
I'd like to see this installed at the M+S namespace URI asap, with a couple days advance warning to www-rdf-interest@w3.org so that we can flush out any problems / implementor concerns asap. 
Having recently done the RDF Schema namespace upgrade, I'd be happy to do the admin for this one, once the WG, Eric and Ralph are in agreement. 
cheers, Dan 
k. Is there any machine checking we can get done on this. 
Brian 
Looks good, Brian. 
(I didn't review it for completeness.) 
Why not put that text inside a dc:description property?

Yes, since you want to keep the original namespace name I feel that it would be inappropriate to use new syntax in any RDF content at that namespace URI until at least Proposed Rec. 
All good things to have added. 
We didn't do it in the original 
content as RDFS wasn't available to us at the time. 
Thanks very much for doing this task, Brian. 
Right, I also believe that rdf.rdf is correct. 
I checked it with Cwm and Jena and compared it with what we assumed and found one difference which is rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdf:Property . 
where we had rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdfs:Resource . 
which we took from the "RDFS axiomatic triples" table in the "RDF Semantics Editors Draft July 31" I propose that the more precise triple is in the MT (both the table and the LBase translation).

That looks plausible. 
Pat? 
Brian 
Right, will do. 
Also added xml version element at front. 
Updated version attached. 
Brian 
good; thanks 
DanC reminds us periodically that ?xml version="1.0"? is not required. 
Only if an encoding is to be given is this necessary. 
While we're at it... Could I encourage other WG members to supply rdfs:label values in their native languages to add to this document? 
Let's use this as an example of how the new spec wants language information to be encoded in RDF/XML. 
The RDFS namespace document had both French and English labels in it until a few days ago. 
I would like to see those returned to the document as well, please. 
My recollection is that we changed this from Property to Resource a while ago, for some reason that now escapes me. 
I have no objection to either.
