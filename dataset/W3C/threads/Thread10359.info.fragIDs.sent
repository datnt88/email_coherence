<s> I had an action from last weeks telecon to draft an RDFS document to replace the one at the end of the RDF namespace  </s>
<s> I have attached such a draft.  </s>
<s> It is a cut down version of rdfs.rdf with:  </s>
<s> - a new comment inserted to describe the document  </s>
<s> - the owl:ontology modified to the RDF URI - terms in the RDFS vocabulary are removed in the sense that they are not defined in this document  </s>
<s> It uses only syntax defined in M&amp;S, specifically, xml:base is not used.  </s>
<s> Ralph considered this important, at least until we get to rec.  </s>
<s> Differences from the document at currently at the rdf namespace URI are: - labels are included for all terms - the comments are consistent with those used in RDFS.rdf and the  </s>
<s> current specs  </s>
<s> - an Owl ontology element has been added  </s>
<s> - the list vocabulary rdf:List, rdf:nil, rdf:first and rdf:rest has  </s>
<s> been added - the rdf:XMLLiteral class has been added.  </s>
<s> - domain and ranges for rdf:value are specified for all properties  </s>
<s> - there is an rdfs:subClassOf property for all classes - there is an rdfs:isDefinedBy property for all terms  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Thanks Brian, looks good to me.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see this installed at the M+S namespace URI asap, with a couple days advance warning to www-rdf-interest@w3.org so that we can flush out any problems / implementor concerns asap.  </s>
<s> Having recently done the RDF Schema namespace upgrade, I'd be happy to do the admin for this one, once the WG, Eric and Ralph are in agreement.  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> k. Is there any machine checking we can get done on this.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Looks good, Brian.  </s>
<s> (I didn't review it for completeness.)  </s>
<s> Why not put that text inside a dc:description property?  </s>
<s> It uses only syntax defined in M&amp;S, specifically, xml:base is not used.  </s>
<s> Ralph considered this important, at least until we get to rec.  </s>
<s> Yes, since you want to keep the original namespace name I feel that it would be inappropriate to use new syntax in any RDF content at that namespace URI until at least Proposed Rec.  </s>
<s> All good things to have added.  </s>
<s> We didn't do it in the original  </s>
<s> content as RDFS wasn't available to us at the time.  </s>
<s> Thanks very much for doing this task, Brian.  </s>
<s> Right, I also believe that rdf.rdf is correct.  </s>
<s> I checked it with Cwm and Jena and compared it with what we assumed and found one difference which is rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> where we had rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdfs:Resource .  </s>
<s> which we took from the "RDFS axiomatic triples" table in the "RDF Semantics Editors Draft July 31" I propose that the more precise triple is in the MT (both the table and the LBase translation).  </s>

<s> Pat?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Right, will do.  </s>
<s> Also added xml version element at front.  </s>
<s> Updated version attached.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> good; thanks  </s>
<s> DanC reminds us periodically that ?xml version="1.0"? is not required.  </s>
<s> Only if an encoding is to be given is this necessary.  </s>
<s> While we're at it... Could I encourage other WG members to supply rdfs:label values in their native languages to add to this document?  </s>
<s> Let's use this as an example of how the new spec wants language information to be encoded in RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> The RDFS namespace document had both French and English labels in it until a few days ago.  </s>
<s> I would like to see those returned to the document as well, please.  </s>
<s> My recollection is that we changed this from Property to Resource a while ago, for some reason that now escapes me.  </s>
<s> I have no objection to either.  </s>
