I just found a typo in the IANA charset file at Instead of Alais: csEBCDICPT it should read Alias: csEBCDICPT Can this please be corrected? 
The file also contained some spurious spaces, and used sometimes "Alias: None" and sometimes just "Alias:" to indicate the absence of aliases. 
Maybe that can be corrected, too. 
I'm willing to help. 
Many thanks and kind regards, Martin. 
P.S.: Did I send this to (all) the right list(s)? 
Is there any review necessary, or can this be done asap? 
Should be easy to fix, but probably not the highest priority. 
Not controversial. 
Thanks! 
(My guess - you are writing scripts that use the information....?) Yes, good guess. 
Regards, Martin.
