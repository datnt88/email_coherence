<s> The current Grant Of License for Contributions under the W3C Software License states the following: The Contributor vouches that she/he has all rights necessary to contribute the Materials in a way that does not violate copyright, patent, and trademark rights; contractual obligations, or libel regulations.  </s>
<s> Some companies are not willing to do a full patent search in their portfolio before submitting tests to the W3C.  </s>
<s> This is perfectly understandable when you see the costs of doing such a search.  </s>
<s> The current word should imho relaxed a little bit or we'll run the risk of excluding tests submission from some companies.  </s>
<s> Here is a proposal to change the current wording: The Contributor states to the best of his/her knowledge that use of his/her contribution would not infringe any of his/her patent rights or third party patent rights.  </s>
<s> (The Contributor can be also a company, not only an individual.  </s>
<s> I think the current wording takes this fact into account.) Philippe  </s>
<s> Sure, if this doesn't mean tests can be taken back in case a mishap is spotted.  </s>
<s> I'm not an expert on licensing issues, so this may not happen.  </s>
<s> (that wouldn't be possible for DOM TS that was released, for example).  </s>

<s> Philippe, I agree the wording of that grant should be improved as you suggested.  </s>
<s> I hope that the W3C will soon be reviewing an harmonizing the different grants of license.  </s>
