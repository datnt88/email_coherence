Hi, In TLDP-ES (http://es.tldp.org)s 
we are developing a system for classification of documentation's projects based on RDF, and our intention is to use TAP to share bibliographical cards between different servers. 
The RDF files can be consulted in this URL: And this is the tests server in which we have installed TAP: The problem is that when making a qwery, the accent letters and other special characters are not show. 
For example, where it would have to show: "C?digo de identificaci?n 
del proyecto de documentaci?n" it shows: "Cdigo de identificacin del proyecto de documentacin" In the Spanish language (and other languages) we needed to be able to use those characters. 
Is possible implement this on TAP by some fmethod? 
Another question. 
It is possible to refresh the cache of TAP without having to restart Apache?

Thanks for letting me know where these are, I'll test with them. 
We had a lot of trouble with XML parsers choking on bad character sets early on, and it appears I made the Perl code to fix the problem too aggressive. 
it seems to have turned your title into nonsense. 
I'll look at fixing and hopefully will have a fix later this week. 
Yes, but there's a problem in 0.72 which may cause the server to not notice the changes. 
I have a patch in the as-yet-unreleased 0.75 but I'll wait until later in the week to try and release these two fixes together.

In the CVS the files really are enconding in ISO-8859-1. 
I chage de encoding to UTP-8 with iconv when put them un the server. 
Bat the problen is the same with one encoding or another. 
The two version validate correctly in http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ 
I see some of the bugs of Perl with UTF-8 in http://bugs6.perl.org 
:-/ Thanks, I'm waiting for the new release.
