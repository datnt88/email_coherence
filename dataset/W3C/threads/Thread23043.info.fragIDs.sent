The DOM Level 1 specification (1st edition) and the working draft of the 
DOM Level 2 HTML specification both specify that the HTMLSelectElement 
interface has a property named "value" which is documented as "the current value of the form control". 
The HTMLSelectElement is defined in terms of the SELECT tag in the HTML 4.0 specification, but the SELECT tag does not have a VALUE attribute. 
To the best of my knowledge, typical Level 0 implementations 
do not define a value property for select elements, either. 
I see two possibilities here, both requiring a change to the spec: 1) This is an error, and the spec should be changed to remove the value property from the HTMLSelectElement 2) This is not an error, and the value property was intentionally part of HTMLSelectElement. 
In this case, however, the current documentation of the property is insufficient, and the spec needs to be clarified Anyone have other ideas?

The current value of the form control is the value of the currently selected 
OPTION - it's a convenient shortcut, and most Mac browsers (MSIE, NS6, Moz, 
Opera, iCab) support it. 
I suppose Windows browsers do the same.

Nope, it's not widely supported, and for that reason see little reason in now standardising it, extra levels of complexity that can never be used in real life situations are of little use to anyone. 
(what's the value defined as in multiple select anyway?) Jim. 
Okay, so you're saying that the value attribute of a select element s is the same thing as 
s.options[s.selectedIndex].value. 
This is a useful shortcut. 
Still, since 
HTML does not define a value attribute for the SELECT tag, I think the spec needs to be clarified to say exactly what this value property is.

Does this have to be an erratum, or would merely adding it to the FAQ be sufficient?

More exactly: - If no option is selected, SELECT.value is the empty string (NC 4.x returns 
null, but all modern browsers return the empty string in this case) 
- If at least one option is selected, SELECT.value returns the value of the *first* selected OPTION. 
- Setting SELECT.value has no effect in current implementations.

AvantGo 4 for example doesn't, and is pretty modern! 
Not in my experience/testing, in IE5.5 and Mozilla 0.9.2 (win98) for example, it changes the select box such that the selected option is the first element with that value (if no element has that value, then all are deselected and the select displays nothing in IE/the previous value in Mozilla.)
