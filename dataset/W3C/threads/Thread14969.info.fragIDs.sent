Hi Ben. the correct url is: 
My regrets at missing the call. 
I fell asleep putting my daughter to sleep. 
Woke up again after 1am. 
a few comments 1,RE: RDF and alternive content: RDF for accessibility is underway. 
And hopefully we are also getting some Dublin Core participation on this. 
we hopefully will get this into a standard form in time for WCAG 2. In other words to make RDF or meta data part of the standard, all we have to do is say, "OK , let us have an RDF techniques document". 
I volunteer to edit it. 
We are also working on user agent support for RDF, that's compatible with screen readers. 
2, Is there any reason why it is not OK to have RDF or meta data for alternive text instead of using an HTML alt tag, if there is adequate user again support? 
4, RE: making a metadata snippet for people to add to their header to claim conformance. 
I think that is as easy as it gets. 
It is no more work then coping the code snippet for the icon and putting that in the body of the code.
