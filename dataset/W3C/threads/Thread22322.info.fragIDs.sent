<s> Does anyone know of an east way/implementation to convert a DOM tree/subtree  </s>

<s> It is not obvious to me that this is part of the w3c DOM specification.  </s>

<s> I think the XML4J implementation of AlphaWorks includes a sample java class (DOMWriter).  </s>

<s> In fact, it is not a part of the current specification.  </s>
<s> Each implementation does it its own special way (if at all).  </s>
<s> The same is true for creating a DOM tree from XML. Tom Otvos Director of Research, Pervasive Software Inc. "Try not!  </s>

<s> tree/subtree  </s>
<s> No, it's not part of the spec.  </s>
<s> Most implementors of the DOM have extended it to have some way of serializing a DOM tree or subtree as XML.  </s>
<s> Hello, I've seen that this question has been asked a few months ago by Dan, but I couldn't find a solution.  </s>
<s> I'm using the XML4J DOMParser to parse an xml file.  </s>
<s> Then, I modify the DOM tree (with methods such as insertBefore, removeChild, etc), and I would like the initial xml file to relect those changes.  </s>
<s> Do you know how I can do that ?  </s>
<s> I've read that this should be possible with the DOM level 2 specification, but is there a "temporary" solution ?  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help, Regards, Benedicte  </s>
