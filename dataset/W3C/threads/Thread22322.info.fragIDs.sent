Does anyone know of an east way/implementation to convert a DOM tree/subtree 
to XML output string? 
It is not obvious to me that this is part of the w3c DOM specification. 
Thanks in advance for any help.

Hi, 
I think the XML4J implementation of AlphaWorks includes a sample java class (DOMWriter).

In fact, it is not a part of the current specification. 
Each implementation does it its own special way (if at all). 
The same is true for creating a DOM tree from XML. Tom Otvos Director of Research, Pervasive Software Inc. "Try not!

There is no 'try'." - Yoda 
tree/subtree 
No, it's not part of the spec. 
Most implementors of the DOM have extended it to have some way of serializing a DOM tree or subtree as XML. 
Hello, I've seen that this question has been asked a few months ago by Dan, but I couldn't find a solution. 
I'm using the XML4J DOMParser to parse an xml file. 
Then, I modify the DOM tree (with methods such as insertBefore, removeChild, etc), and I would like the initial xml file to relect those changes. 
Do you know how I can do that ? 
I've read that this should be possible with the DOM level 2 specification, but is there a "temporary" solution ? 
Thanks a lot for your help, Regards, Benedicte
