The following came up on Jena-dev, with the refrain "that sounds like a job for best practices" ... (not exactly) given an arbitrary source of semantic web data on the 'net, what *is* the best practice for determining which 
semantic-web language and encoding is being used? 
(e.g. use OWL Full or DL or RDFS semantics) 
It's not clear to me if this fits under the WorldView TF or not, maybe we need an issue list, as suggested by Brian, to keep track of public questions that we may or may not answer. 
Maybe we need an e-mail list for people to raise such questions (or do we want to encourage questions to be sent to this list by anyone, like www-tag). 
If we do end up with an issue list, Ian Dickinson is the issue raiser.

I'm not sure if this counts as best practice, but we use a simulated stochastic process to determine which Semantic Web language is being used by a particular file. 
You can see a demo of our technique at:

I think that qualifies under the "sorting out the mess that we've made" Isn't intended as an RDFS file, not OWL Full? 
(The semantics differ ...) 
It made me laugh though.

I think that this rather proves Ian's point - I'm using Sean's species validator behind the scenes (and a few simple and no doubt defeasible heuristics), and it reports it as OWL Full. 
Maybe the question should instead have been "what is the best practice for *indicating* which semantic-web language and encoding is being used"? 
So justifying the (minimal) effort...

Named graphs could do that ... but that's still a research topic. 
(Discussed on SWIG) If we have a URI for the graph, then we can make statements about it, such as its intended assertional status, its intended semantic theory etc. Jeremy
