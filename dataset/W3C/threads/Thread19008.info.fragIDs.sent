<s> Dear WAI XTech, Here is the proposed HTML 4.01 errata text for handling of access key.  </s>
<s> Please feel free to review now, or later when we publish the next proposed  </s>

<s> Best wishes,  </s>
<s> Steven Pemberton Chair HTML WG When rendering to the "handheld" medium, pressing an accesskey for a  </s>
<s> hyperlink or button SHOULD activate.  </s>
<s> When rendering to all other mediums,  </s>
<s> pressing an accesskey SHOULD transfer the focus, even for hyperlinks and  </s>
<s> buttons.  </s>
<s> User agents MAY (and are encouraged to) provide a user preference to override the default behavior, and allow accesskeys to always activate  </s>
<s> hyperlinks and buttons, or always focus hyperlinks and buttons.  </s>
<s> See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/2002OctDec/0042.html  </s>
<s> This may seem completely off the wall but is there language that doesn't limit this "allowance" to just these two alternatives.  </s>
<s> What if I want to activate a certain "class" of hyperlinks but only focus on others?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious!  </s>
<s> Hmm. I think that this will work.  </s>
<s> I think it would be better to say that accesskey must allow transfer of the focus, and should allow direct activation, and should allow configuration.  </s>
<s> (I think that direct activation should be the default, and that therefore the requirement for configuration becomes effectively a must.  </s>
<s> I use accesskey on a medium other than handheld, as a way to relieve overuse.  </s>
<s> For some disabilities this is the primary requirement, and every extra keystroke significantly reduces the value.  </s>
<s> (This includes modifiers as well as the need to confirm activation if there is only a focus transfer).  </s>

<s> Steven, Could the note also encourage features that allow the user to review the current access key bindings of a resource.  </s>

<s> Hi Steven, I have a few questions and comments.  </s>
<s> 1) Does "activate" mean "move the focus, then activate"?  </s>
<s> For instance, if I go to another page and then do "back", will the focus be on the hyperlink I reached through that accesskey?  </s>
<s> 2) Is the proposed errata text based on the behavior of deployed user agents?  </s>
<s> Has there been demand for the "set-focus-only" behavior, or is that just how some user agents implement this feature of HTML?  </s>
<s> I reviewed UAAG 1.0 and I believe that the document is silent on the matter of separating focus from activation in the case of direct access (e.g., through accesskey).  </s>
<s> That may be an oversight, or simply lack of demand for that feature.  </s>
<s> I would like UAAG 1.0 to support the HTML WG's approach, and one way to do this (though we are extremely late in the game) is to mention this type of configuration in the Techniques Document.  </s>
<s> I think that in any case, the HTML spec should explain a little bit why this type of configuration is useful, and that may require a bit more explanation about the purpose of focus; in UAAG 1.0, focus is a navigation tool that preserves context.  </s>
<s> Direct access techniques such as accesskeys can serve two purposes: a) To allow the user to perform some task quickly.  </s>
<s> b) To provide more efficient navigation (i.e., focus displacement) than sequential navigation.  </s>
<s> In the UAAG 1.0 document, we use the "c" accesskey for direct access to the table of contents.  </s>
<s> The purpose is not to allow users to quickly follow the first link in the table of contents, but to navigate to it efficiently.  </s>
<s> I think that format specifications should allow authors to specify these two behaviors independently, so that users are not required to reconfigure their browsers at all.  </s>
<s> This seems to me to be a case where the author knows the desired effect (navigation or activation) and should encode it as such; the burden should not be on the user.  </s>
<s> For direct access with intent to activate, I don't think the "focus only" option is very interesting: the user would generally only use those accesskeys once the binding between key and task is known.  </s>
<s> In this case, there is no longer a need for orientation, and the user is unlikely to want to focus first then activate.  </s>
<s> I also note that the user is unlikely to want to discover available accesskeys by randomly testing key combinations; the focus-but-don't-activate should not be taken as a mechanism for allowing binding discovery (see instead UAAG 1.0 checkpoint 11.2).  </s>
<s> I can imagine the focus-but-don't-activate setting as a repair technique to generate additional direct navigation stops.  </s>
<s> However, since UAAG 1.0 includes requirements designed to improve efficient navigation, I don't know that the repair technique of turning activation hints into navigation hints should be condoned.  </s>
<s> I realize that for HTML, there's no question of including markup that would allow the author to distinguish navigation stops from task shortcuts.  </s>
<s> XAG should include this type of recommendation if it passes muster in WAI PF.  </s>
<s> However, the HTML 4 spec might at least say a word more about why the configuration can be useful to users.  </s>
<s> 3) I'm not sure why handhelds are singled out.  </s>
<s> Is the reason "that's how things work today" or is there some other design reason?  </s>
<s> If there is no design justification (i.e., if all users of any device might find both configurations useful) then I recommend the following approach instead: a) Requirement: "User agents SHOULD provide at least two configurations for accesskeys: set focus only, and set focus and activate.  </s>
<s> b) Requirement: User agents rendering to the 'handheld' medium SHOULD use the default configuration "set focus and activate."  </s>
<s> Other user agents SHOULD use the default configuration "set focus only".  </s>
<s> Whether or not there is a design justification, I think the spec should say something about why handheld devices are singled out.  </s>
<s> And, as I mentioned earlier, I think the spec should explain why the configuration is useful to some users.  </s>

<s> I disagree it is often useful for some one to move the focus to a navigation bar and then select something else from the navigation bar.  </s>
<s> But getting the focus near a target is useful.  </s>
<s> Remember access keys for form controls move focus to those controls, so for links there would be consistency with form controls.  </s>
<s> For people with visual impairments it is often difficult for them to understand the difference between a button and a link, since they do no see the graphical styling.  </s>
