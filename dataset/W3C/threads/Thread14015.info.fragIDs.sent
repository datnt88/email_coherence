<s> I am here responding to a suggestion by Kynn Bartlett that the current  </s>
<s> definition of conformance is inadequate in that it does not allow claims  </s>
<s> of partial compliance, in cases where developers have not had time to redesign their content so as to conform completely at a particular level of priority.  </s>
<s> Kynn argues, as I understand his position, that the broad granularity of the conformance requirement may operate as a disinsentive that militates against application of checkpoints at a higher level of priority than that to which full compliance is asserted.  </s>
<s> At the risk of complicating the conformace section of the guidelines, and assuming, without presently expressing an opinion on the point, that this drawback is outwayed by the persuasiveness of Kynn's argument, I would suggest that in a future revision of the document, a qualification could be added to the "conformance" section along the following lines: If a conformance statement asserts compliance with level A or level double-A of these guidelines, then it may be supplemented by a list of checkpoints, drawn, in the case of level A conformance, from the set of all priority 2 and 3 checkpoints, and in the case of double-A conformance, from the set of priority 3 checkpoints, to which compliance is also claimed.  </s>
<s> Any such supplemental list must specify the reference number of each checkpoint, as provided in the guidelines document, and must either appear on the same page as the conformance statement or be prominently and unambiguously linked thereto.  </s>
<s> Note that in this proposal, I have specifically excluded the possibility of claiming partial conformance below level A, on the footing that Level A requirements are absolutely fundamental in providing a basic level of  </s>
<s> accessibility.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that there is nothing to stop developers claiming partial  </s>
<s> conformance in ny way they want, but the actual conformance section of the  </s>
<s> document says effectively that the group thinks there are three different  </s>
<s> types of conformance, which signal three different levels of accessibility,  </s>
<s> and do not offer any official recognition for any other type of claim.  </s>
<s> Effectively this allows the developers of web content to say all manner of  </s>

<s> content, and to say that they claim to have attained (or exceeded) a  </s>
<s> particular level of accessibility according to the WCAG 1.0 out of a small  </s>
<s> number of possible levels.  </s>
<s> Having a very small number of possible levels,  </s>
<s> with simple natural descriptions of what they mean, allows for a much easier  </s>

<s> Here's my take on it.  </s>
<s> We present a number of Guidelines, which are great.  </s>
<s> They are prioritized, which are great.  </s>
<s> They have abundant techniques, which is great.  </s>
<s> However, when it comes to implementation, the Guidelines as written only present three suggested plans for implemenation of these very valuable guidelines: Either: (a) Implement all priority one checkpoints, or (b) Implement all priority one and two checkpoints, or (c) Implement all checkpoints.  </s>
<s> It strikes me that none of these are reasonable implementation plans for any "real life" website.  </s>
<s> None are usable for the corporation, government agency, or educational organization who is seeking advice and guidance on creating an accessible web site.  </s>
<s> This is where we have our breakdown -- we don't give good implemenation advice.  </s>
<s> Without the single-A, double-AA, triple-AAA levels concept, we fall back to "must", "should", "may", which actually _is_ an acceptable, but loose, plan for implementation.  </s>
<s> Adding on the levels, however, moves us past "must", "should", and "may" and recommends an _implementation plan_ (or at least, something that will be taken as such) which is completely nonsensical.  </s>
<s> A rationally crafted implemenation plan by a company (org, school, etc.) will include checkpoints of all levels, depending on their ability, focus, time, and desires.  </s>
<s> Any good plan MUST include all priority one checkpoints, but may still remain accessible if only a subset of level two or three is included.  </s>
<s> However, the current "levels" system does _not_ encourage the creation of a rational implementation plan by companies and agencies, but instead encourages braindead implementation strictly along priority levels.  </s>
<s> EM THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND WILL HURT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE WEB IN THE LONG RUN.  </s>
<s> /EM We do _not_ want to be encouraging blind obedience to "shoulds" and overlooking of "mays" -- we _want_ to encourage web site managers to take a serious look at the issues and create a web site accessibility policy that works _for them_.  </s>
<s> In summary: The "three levels of compliance" will be taken as implemention plans; all of them, by not encouraging thoughtful application of the WCAG, make very bad implemenation plans.  </s>
<s> We should not encourage braindead implementation; the levels of compliance are a threat to what we're trying to do here.  </s>

<s> I disagree entirely; I think we need to be more concerned with the checkpoint priorities and remember they are based on "must", "should" and "may", and not focus so highly on single-A/double-AA/triple-AAA!  </s>
<s> I think WCAG _should_ be a Chinese menu (anyone need that idiom explained?) because that's how it's written and that's apparently the intent of the document!  </s>
<s> To use it otherwise -- to decree that the priority levels constitute a sensible implementation plan -- is ridiculous!  </s>

<s> In the UAGL WG we have already explored the conformance issue in depth.  </s>
<s> Please refer, for example, to my summary of options discussed by the UAGL WG [1] [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0017.html  </s>
<s> The summary includes Kynn's proposal to allow vendors to pick and choose checkpoints they wish to/can satisfy.  </s>
<s> The working group was in favor of this option for a while (refer to a WG decision [2] to this effect).  </s>
<s> [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/01/wai-ua-telecon-19990106.html#action  </s>
<s> However, in the end we did not choose this scheme for an important reason: we decided that the UA guidelines needed to ensure compatibility between two important classes of user agents: desktop graphical browsers and dependent assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> There are other possible combinations or stand-alone systems, but the WG decided that ensuring communication and interoperability between these two common classes was the first concern.  </s>
<s> To ensure compatibility, the WG decided that the picking and choosing mechanism was insufficient.  </s>
<s> Staying with the East for a moment: I think that people who conform to WCAG should wear yellow belts, brown belts, black belts, etc. according to their achievements and dedication.  </s>
<s> In the world of martial arts (and to the general population) these belts represent known and standardized levels of achievement and instant recognition of them ( wink though color alone does not suffice /wink ) is a valuable feature.  </s>
<s> People can learn a kick or a chop on its own, but the system encourages them to pursue known levels that have evolved from much experience and testing.  </s>
<s> While WCAG 1.0 admittedly does not benefit from hundreds of years of experience, the principle remains the same.  </s>
<s> In short, for those concerned with *conformance* (and not just accessibility), known levels add value.  </s>
<s> For those concerned with accessibility, other systems may be possible, including using the checklist alone to show which checkpoints one satisfies.  </s>
