Amaya 7.1 on win2k is still not cutting and pasting URI's correctly. 
I cannot either cut/copy or paste into the 'Open' address box at the top of the amaya window.

On Fri, 20 Dec 2002 15:52:21 -0500 Danny, I'm sure the bug was fixed in the release 7.1. 
I guess your install of the 7.1 didn't work correctly. 
Could you remove all pre-installed versions and retry the install of the version 7.1? 
Happy new year Irene. 
Hi Irene, I just de-installed, re-installed and re-started. 
The bug is mostly fixed though I experienced an odd result. 
When I first opened Amaya I still couldn't copy from the 'Open' box at the top of the window and paste into another app (mIRC, TTERM, Outlook): tried both ctrl-c and Edit/Copy. 
However, then I pasted into the document I was editing in amaya, everything worked fine. 
I can't reproduce the original error any more. 
I'll let you know if I have more problems.... Best for a Happy New Year, Danny Irene: There is a quirk I see in W2K that started with v7: the "Open" text looks as selected when the program starts, even when it's doesn't have the focus. 
This is a bit confusing. 
It looks as if you were enabled to ctrol+X to cut it but it does nothing. 
It works after moving focus to the Open field. 
Also, BTW, I've found a way to move the focus there by using the keyboard. 
Netscape uses ctrol+tab, it might be also ctrol+PgDown. 
This is used to switch from a focus cycle to a different one. 
Saludos!
