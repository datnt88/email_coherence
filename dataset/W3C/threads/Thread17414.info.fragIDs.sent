<s> I am unsure exactly what we are supposed to be seeing or doing.  </s>
<s> When I attempt to open this URI in my Netscape 7.1 browser, it launches my Adobe SVG viewer inside the browser window of my Internet Explore browser (IE opens a window in a different application)... this is a plug-in issue more than anything else...  </s>
<s> I am presented with essentially a blank page... it reads "peepo.co.uk a-z?", with the "a-z" being "hyperlinked to something.  </s>
<s> Attempting to "click" on the hyperlinks produces a "The page cannot be displayed" error message.  </s>
<s> The status line (in IE) indicates: "Unrecognized DOCTYPE declaration.  </s>
<s> Image might not display correctly".  </s>
<s> Attempting to tab through the page does not produce any concrete "action" or result.  </s>
<s> There are no instructions, either in the original email, nor on the page loaded.  </s>
<s> To this "user" there is nothing actually accessible here, as a matter of fact, there appears to be "nothing", period.  </s>
<s> Am I the only one missing something here?  </s>

<s> Well - if you don't have the Adobe plug-in installed it tells you that its best viewed with one and there's a link to the Adobe SVG Viewer site.  </s>
<s> The .com site has sounds as you rollover the images, maybe the .co.uk is under development?  </s>
<s> Is the point that it's a site actually developed by people with learning difficulties?  </s>
<s> An on-going project perhaps?  </s>

<s> I'm asked to install a plug in.  </s>
<s> Is this the type of behaviour that you expected Jonathan?  </s>
<s> --J.  </s>
<s> You need Mozilla or Amaya to be reasonably up to date in this respect.  </s>
<s> If Opera doesn't support SVG it has a serious hole in its image support, as SVG is the only vector image standard from W3C.  </s>
<s> It may be possible to convince Opera to support it, although with development of IE stalled and Flash available from Windows Update, I don't think it likely that there will be mainstream support in the near future, and the Opera people may be more interested in tracking IE than giving broad standards support.  </s>
<s> (That you get redirected to IE may be because of the use of ActiveX references; these tend to be the only way of getting IE to work well with plugin solutions.)  </s>
<s> Whilst I haven't looked at this page, and suspect that I would find it difficult to understand if I did (past examples, using HTML, have been), the level of graphics and animation that Jonathon believes his audience requires is not appropriate for HTML, and, whilst I would rather there were built-in support for static SVG images in IE, rather than the current situation with SVG trying to take over the world (replace Flash, HTML,.....) but with only a small proportion of web users having access to it, SVG is the most appropriate W3C technology to achieve the sort of user interface that he wants, without using special purpose client side executables.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, a design goal of SVG (although I doubt most users achieve them) is that you should be able to strip all the tags and leave meaningful text.  </s>
<s> Opera should probably be displaying it as plain text, if it doesn't know how to handle it, but I suspect that it looks like ActiveX because of what is needed to ensure downloading on IE, and that is why it is being handed off to IE. (My suspicion is that IE doesn't support it because they distribute Flash which covers the marketing niche and because they would rather people use Windows metafile diagrams in Word for technical documents, so that they can sell more copies of MS Office.)  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my Mozilla behaves similarly: it says it can't handle the file and suggests Adobe as the default.  </s>
<s> When I accept that, IE loads, and then gives me a JScript runtime error ("Object expected line: 1, column: 0").  </s>
<s> When I press OK, I get: Please either download the new adobe plug-in or use peepo.com  </s>
<s> (New?  </s>
<s> What version do I have and what version should I have?  </s>
<s> "plug-in" is a link but I can't right-click on it to capture the URL; the page just loads in IE, and tells me: "It is a pre-alpha version that includes experimental features which are subject to change."  </s>
<s> I don't want to download that.  </s>
<s> A reasonably stable beta would be fine with me, pre-alpha, no.) BTW, the page at http://www.peepo.co.uk/ seems to consist entirely of scripts, including VBscript which I'm sure Mozilla does not support.  </s>
<s> There's no DOCTYPE declaration but assuming it's intended as either HTML 4.01 or XHTML the code is not valid: the script tags don't have a type attribute.  </s>
<s> When I try in Amaya I see nothing but a blank page.  </s>
<s> Possibly because it doesn't handle those scripts, or the invalid code.  </s>

<s> Marjolein and all, thanks so much for comments on peepo.co.uk,  </s>
<s> I've now changed the index page so that at least it validates :-(.  </s>
<s> The Adobe asv6 plugin is stable, and allows one to create and use external graphics libraries, this is critical during development.  </s>
<s> maintenance is a real hassle in any case.  </s>
<s> Our site develops in response to user comments, so is always a live development cycle.  </s>
<s> over the next week or two the site should accommodate a broader range of svg viewers.  </s>
<s> The icons are now tested across a range of browsers, OS, and plugins.  </s>
<s> It will remain to be seen how the minimal svg animation or scripting copes.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately SVG just isn't that accessible, for instance keyboard access isn't, well others might claim differently.... one can't copy and paste the images, so repurposing is minimal.  </s>
<s> The great benefit is the graphics quality, and the open source.  </s>
<s> "mouse or rat' is a new book by Umberto Eco on the meaning of translation.  </s>
<s> I've only read a review.... given my interest in iconic interfaces, the need to demonstrate the confusion of words is.  </s>
