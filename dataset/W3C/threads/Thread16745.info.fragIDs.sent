<s> Forms you can fill out online are neither anathema nor panacaea.  </s>
<s> Evidently you haven't read either the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines nor the draft User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Both of these contain information clarifying what works and doesn't work in online forms.  </s>
<s> As a service provider, you should offer and advertise an alternative to Web forms, for example via 800 number and/or plain text email.  </s>
<s> But web forms can be highly successful in serving people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> From what little I know, people with disabilities are significantly involved in using Web commerce and Amazon.com is a generally usable site, for example.  </s>

<s> Randy Welcome to the list...  </s>
<s> I am not sure it you are covered by the section 508 legislation, but if you are you will need to ensure that your on-line forms are consistent with 1194.22(n) of that legislation:- 'When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.'  </s>
<s> This of course begs for a definition of 'assistive technology', you will need to decide what assistive technology to test with.  </s>
<s> I have written an article on producing accessible forms in Domino, if you are interested in that email me.  </s>
<s> So, to answer your question, they are not a no-no and it does depend on how they are presented.  </s>
