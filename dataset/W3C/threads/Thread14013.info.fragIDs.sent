I was wondering how math is covered in the current guidelines. 
I didn't see any mention of math in either the guidelines or techniques document. 
It is an important issue, was it intentionally left out for some reason?

Currently, there are few solutions available in this area. 
MathML, once supported by appropriate braille and speech output software, will work, but it is difficult to incorporate MathML into an HTML document at this stage. 
I understand that most authors use in-line images as a kludge to present the mathematical notation visually. 
Perhaps as an interim measure they could use LaTeX markup as convenient ALT text (it has the advantage of being relatively compact and well known). 
The other alternative would be to use OBJECT to incorporate each mathematical expression into a document: object type\"text/xml" data="equation1.xml" 
Equation 1, marked up in MathML /object and likewise for every mathematical expression in the document. 
IBM has a plug-in for Netscape and IE that reads TEX and LaTex documents and soon MathML documents. 
Have not tested it, just know it exists. 
you can download a demo version from Jim Allan, Statewide Technical Support Specialist Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired 1100 W. 45th St., Austin, Texas 78756 "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us." McLuhan, 1964 
Perhaps better would be A HREF="equation1.html" IMG SRC="equation1.gif" 
ALT="equation one" /A Where equation1.html is the equation expressed verbally. 
Additional formats, such as LaTeX could also be used as OBJECTs in cascade. 
In any case, the problem is covered already in the guidelines, in particular in the requirement for newer technologies to be supplemented by some more accessible format, or for complex images, tables, etc, to have accessible means of giving the information. 
(Depending on whether the 'show as images' or the 'insert MathML' method is the basic one.) It is simply the example cases that are too restrictive, and by their similarity allow the reader to imagine that they only apply to genuinely graphic (and in limited cases audio) content. 
Charles McCathieNevile The other alternative would be to use OBJECT to incorporate each mathematical expression into a document: object type\"text/xml" data="equation1.xml" 
Equation 1, marked up in MathML /object and likewise for every mathematical expression in the document. 
Including MathML with OBJECT or even images with IMG in a normal scientific paper is impractical due to the large number of mathematical expressions in a paper. 
But the future is promising: http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/ 
The current techniques include 1. using PDF, PostScript, or LaTeX-DVI instead of HTML/XML The guidelines may suggest to provide also a TeX or LaTeX version, as there is software who can transform it to speech, rather than providing only ready to print-useless for speech versions. 
2. Many converters from TeX to HTML use incorrect markup to fake mathematical symbols. 
For example: FONT face="symbol" a /FONT to generate the Greek lower case alpha. 
this is incorrect as a conforming browser should render the Latin letter lower case a in this case. 
The guidelines should warn against this practice and recommend using correct markup e.g., the HTML4.0 entity &amp;alpha; As this is done usually by automatic converters it may be mentioned also in authoring tools guidelines.

My main concern related to math is that I would like to point to the guidelines for faculty on the UIUC campus for how to make accessible WWW documents. 
At least 30 to 40 percent of the instructors on campus use some type of simple math and/or complex math in their WWW documents. 
There is no mention of how to represent mathematical expressions in the current guidelines. 
Currently most instructors use images, which we know are not very accessible. 
Since educators may be the first group forced (due to educational legislation in the USA) to use the guidelines, I think it would be important to have a technique or section the clearly indicates what to do now and in the future for math with some examples to demonstrate. 
John Gardner at Oregon State or T. V. Raman at Adobe may be a good reference for this issue, if the working group wants to pursue it. 
Now: Some type of alt text or longdesc that represents math? 
Future: MathML ?

There hasn't been much attention paid to math lately. 
I am glad it is coming around again. 
Most in-line use of math could be adequately represented today by writing words in the Alt tag. 
A good screen reader will read the alt tag smoothly. 
Personally I do not believe that it is possible for an author today to do anything except write a longdesc word description of displayed equations that would make them usable by people with severe print disabilities. 
And I am dubious that long complicated equations would be very usable in word form. 
This is only "better than nothing". 
It may not even be better than nothing. 
I do not believe that either Netscape or Internet Explorer has yet implemented longdesc. 
PW Webspeak has. 
At least they say they have, but I haven't found anything to test it on yet. 
MathML is certainly capable of providing accessible math. 
My group has already submitted a proposal to the NSF to make a mathML plug-in that would render mathML in a linear form compatible with screen readers. 
This could be done quickly but speaking linear math is clumsier than one would like. 
Our next step would be to make a self-voicing plug-in that can render math more naturally. 
My concern is that I do not see any groundswell of acceptance of mathML. 
Friends tell me that the visual rendering is currently really ugly, and nobody wants to put ugly things on the web when they have the choice. 
So mathML may soon be accessible to blind people, but if it isn't accessible to sighted people it won't be used. 
The authoring guideline is simple. 
Use mathML. 
However you can't expect authors to follow that guideline until browsers support mathML acceptably.

The expression complexity of visual symbolic language for mathematics breaks the complexity management guidelines for spoken information. 
I see a lot of equations in print with too many productions in them to be spoken comprehensibly in one sentence. 
It's like one needs to sic a composition teacher on them and get the argument restated as a sequence of shorter sentences. 
Another way to state this is: "Here is another domain, like translating programs between programming languages, where a purely syntactic transformation may yield less-than-desirable results." 
The risk associated with expression complexity is greater in speech than in print. 
Loss of tracking kicks in at a lower expression complexity. 
Articulating some mathematical utterance as speech may work better if a whole article is compiled, and not just the text (including math symbol structures) transliterated. 
The shape of the compile process would be something like a) build a knowledge base from the whole article including symbolic exhibits and verbal voice-over b) segment it into feasible verbal paragraphs for readout from the knowledge base, c) code-generate the latter into fluent verbal language. 
Or tolerable.

T V Raman's Aster (as Jason has said, I think) is an example of a good piece of third party technology which translates algebraic expressions (in this case marked up in LaTeX I believe) into speech. 
It includes the ability to chuck the equations, providing the kind of contextualisation available visually, as well as an aural style sheet to provide distinctions. 
The area in which that is important is the User Agent group, and the issue for them to consider is how to present Mathematical equations (or chemistry, or written music, or whatever). 
The issue for the Page Authors is how to present mathematical (or chemical, or musical or whatever) material which requires presentation and markup that falls outside of standard HTML and what it provides. 
THere are a couple of relevant guidelines: Where possible use a w3c technology... Bingo. 
MathML ... where this results in material that does not transform gracefully you must provide an alternative version of the content that is accessible So far as I know MathML does not transform gracefully. 
So use a method that does, such as the example of including a MathML equation as well as an image of it (for sighted users of non-MathML compliant browsers) and a textual description of it (for anybody - if the description is good then the accessibility will be ordinary. 
If the description is bad then the accessibility will be excruciatingly difficult. 
But that's miles ahead of impossible) eg: (I have also included a latex description for those who can read it. 
But the type is probably wrong) OBJECT TYPE="text/MathML" DATA="equation1.xml" TITLE="equation one in MathML markup" OBJECT TYPE="text/latex" DATA="equation1.tex" TITLE="equation one in latex markup" OBJECT TYPE="image/gif" DATA="equation1.gif" TITLE="equation one as a GIF image" A long and very accurate text description, with links to pieces of the equation, so that it can be naturally chunked or listened to as a whole, depending on concentration levels: P A equals One --Charles McCathieNevile W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (visiting) mail: LCS, 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA The expression complexity of visual symbolic language for mathematics breaks the complexity management guidelines for spoken information.

Daniel has pointed out that I should define 'transform gracefully' better. 
In this case the failure of the transforamtion is in legacy systems rather than across media, since properly written MathML will (eventually) be presentable across all media.
