Actually what I want is a whole lot more options from my browser - ideally including a simple scripting language. 
This seems less likely rather than more likely as new versions come out. 
:( Charles McCN What I want then is to load graphics and then have TITLEs displayed with them. 
Sort of like the old printed page captions with pictures or tables or graphs or whatever. 
am I the only one who would like this? 
LQ:: Use of the TITLE attribute (for example, TITLE="Wilson Bentley Snowflake") allows this. 
Browsers should allow the user to toggle among three modes: 1) load all images; 2) don't load images but show the presence of images with ALT text displayed and TITLE available on request; 3) replace images seamlessly with ALT text. 
The second option is the user's way of requesting "seams".

Snip: Actually, I would like to be able to do that, I have had to resort to adding the text to the image-ideally the alt text should be displayed as a caption when the image is displayed. 
I would also like to see an option to click through to a link without having to download images first. 
Marghanita da Cruz Ramin Communications KSW:: MdC:: A CAPTION element contained within OBJECT would have been nice. 
No. The ALT attribute provides a replacement for the image, not a description of it. 
A replacement is rarely appropriate as a caption.
