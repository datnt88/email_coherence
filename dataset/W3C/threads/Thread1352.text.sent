Unless I receive any last minute corrections/comments, 10.13 will be submitted on 1/1/01 as draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-11 for a 2 week working group last call. 
Happy New Year to all !! Cheers, Geoff I request that the the draft be submitted on 1/5/01 for last call at the earliest. 
I am working with our team to prepare some comments to 10.12. 
Realistically, a number of people are out for the holidays and will not return until 1/2 for final input. 
I am also trying to correct section references like the following in Section 5: "In order to ensure unambiguous merging (see section 6.2) and baselining (see section 0) ..." Happy New Year as well, Mark Hi Mark! 
I was aware you were planning on sending in a review by the first week of January, so I made sure that the last call period (from 1/1/01 to 1/15/01) did not interfere with that, but I'm also happy to delay posting the draft until 1/5/01, so that we can get anything you find fixed up before sending it out for last call (such as those section 0 references, thanks to Word's idea of how to silently update cross references!). 
So the two week last call period will now begin on 1/5/01.

Hopefully we can get the changes in so last call only needs to go once. 
I appreciate your allowing the space for feedback. 
I will be submitting some changes on Tuesday after I have a chance to meet with my colleague that returns after break. 
Happy new year, Mark
