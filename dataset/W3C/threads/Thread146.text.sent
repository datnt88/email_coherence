One of the requirements of our application is to accept end user's html. 
In a number of cases this html is poorly written/generated and I'd like to be able to inform the user of such and prohibit acceptance until it's properly written. 
I'd like to use JTidy wrapped in a JSP tag to handle this but the api seams a little confusing to me. 
I can instantiate JTidy but none of the public methods seem to be what I want. 
Instead, I find myself ripping out code from main or instantiating a StreamInImpl so I can use a the Lexer instance and look for errors. 
However this seems less than optimal. 
What I really want is a list of errors as objects such as would be written to stderr. 
Am I missing something entirely or is this not really how JTidy is designed? 
thanks, brian You can use Tidy.getParseErrors() or Tidy.getParseWarnings() to get the error/warning count after a call to Tidy.parse(). 
You could also use Tidy.setErrout(p) to set the error output to go to a PrintWriter p. Andy Quick In properly seams instance Am Those methods only give me the number of errors/warnings. 
I would like to be able to take the input from the user and coupled with the diagnostics from JTidy, highlight the row of the offending error. 
I suppose I could write to the PrintWriter and then parse it, but JTidy already has this information. 
Is there anyway to get a list of objects containing all the error row, col and msgs?
