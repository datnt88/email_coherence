Hi again, Another unreported one: After any command invoked through a keyboard shortcut (I'm using the kbd shortcut Ctrl-s for save for ex), the next character you type doesn't appear. 
Could be a space, tab or any other character, it gets eaten up. 
The arrow keys are not affected. 
The same bhaviour seems to happen after many commands, not just the Save one, but only if using the kbd shortcut.

Hi Yan, Copy/Pase and short cuts seems to work fine.

No they don't! 
I copy a few words, then Paste, then the next character I type doesn't appear. 
The second one does! 
thanks Yan
