<s> Hi again, Another unreported one: After any command invoked through a keyboard shortcut (I'm using the kbd shortcut Ctrl-s for save for ex), the next character you type doesn't appear.  </s>
<s> Could be a space, tab or any other character, it gets eaten up.  </s>
<s> The arrow keys are not affected.  </s>
<s> The same bhaviour seems to happen after many commands, not just the Save one, but only if using the kbd shortcut.  </s>
