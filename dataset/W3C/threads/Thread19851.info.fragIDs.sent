Hello, I'm trying to compile amaya for OS/2 using XFree86 &amp; Lesstif. 
Don't know whether it's desired to receive patches from people "like me" but anyway I can't provide final diffs yet. 
But I can make some suggestions which are useful for other ports, too. 
And yes, "check" means add the few lines to configure(.in) 
1) Check for existence of strcasecmp(). 
I have only stricmp() 
2) Who invented this crazy check for Motif by searching files with given names in pre-defined directories ??? (hmm, I'm aware that it may sound very offending, but I really can't imagine a reason for this method) 
Please use the standard method of checking for headers and libs! 
3) Check for M_PI and M_PI2 
4) Check for lstat(), on my sys is only stat() available. 
This obviously a non-un*x problem, but OTOH amaya seems to support other platforms as well, so this may justify this. 
ALso that's the reason why one uses configure ;-) 
5) Why don't you bundle libwww 5.1x instead of an (probably?) older version ? 
Hmm, I'm still not through all sources but these few topics are 99% of the problems occurring on a first run (haven't checked for other un*xisms so far which may just compile but fail later ...) Bye, Alexander Mai st002279@hrzpub.tu-darmstadt.de

What is stricmp ? 
~ - man stricmp No manual entry for stricmp ~ - If it does the same as you strcasecmp can also patch thotlib/include/thot_sys.h accordingly of your setup using #ifdef OS2 /* or whatever ... */ #define strcasecmp(a, b) stricmp((a), (b)) #endif If we need to check for strcasecmp, that need that we need a fallback implementation and in that case, it's even easier to duplicate it and not even check (like for strncasecmp() in amaya/HTMLstyle.c 
!). However, I added the check to configure.in 
I borrowed it from the configure.in 
of the Lesstif project ! 
excerpt from the configure.in 
... dnl dnl Checking for Motif libraries and includes dnl dnl Borrowed from Lesstif configure.in 
dnl Lesstif is a Great Project (TM) dnl I agree that Lesstif is crazy, who need a Motif clone ;-) 
Which standard method, you need to be more explicit here !!! Especially if you provide a piece of code others will be able to flame you because it doesn't work on their platform ;-) Don't tell me that there is a standard method of checking for XF86 and Motif on OS/2, Windows or a Machintosh ! 
??? 
What do you mean ??? 
lstat is only used in one place and it's to find where the binary has actually been installed on UNIX. 
It's used to be able to follow the link. 
thotlib/base/registry.c: if (lstat (execname, &amp;stat_buf) == 0) .... 
It was protected against #ifndef _WINDOWS, I replace it with #ifdef HAVE_LSTAT, not a big deal ...

I believe it's an older name for strcasecmp() - and I think I've also seen strcmpi() on some platforms!
