<s> Dear Andrew, I just read it through in detail and it is really looking good.  </s>
<s> As I can now print it w/out the Opera crash I was getting previously (perhaps it was one of the markup clean-ups?),  </s>
<s> I've gone through it carefully.  </s>
<s> I've come up with a few more things that I believe need attending to before this goes out for review.  </s>
<s> All are minor things to fix; sorry could not get these together earlier.  </s>
<s> Details below...  </s>
<s> - the layout of the "Business Benefits of Accessible Design" title is wrapping strangely.  </s>
<s> you may still have an align left or align right in there, that would no longer be necessary w/out the resource suite nav bar.  </s>
<s> - the "note" at beginning should be updated as we pull it onto the w3c/wai site to publish it prior to the review request, e.g. not this draft but the  </s>
<s> one to be reviewed on w3c/wai site should say 'is offered for review' rather than 'will be offered.' i will coordinate w/ you on that - typos: i'll list the ones here that i could find, please search main doc for these words: demostrate, retrived, presenation, intructions; linear tables version: benefiuts  </s>
<s> - caps: there's something strange going on w/ caps; many of the acronyms appear to be missing spaces in front of them, or this may in fact be the case, e.g. search for theWCAG or usingSMIL and see if you get anything  </s>
<s> - title of table document: should not have the same title, is confusing, some people might think they have the main document if they are sent there  </s>
<s> - initial cap on "Web": is standard usage for W3C however in the doc is inconsistent, sometimes "web"  </s>
<s> - "final": this doc will still be considered a draft until it has gone _through_ WAI IG review &amp; other review, and so should not be labeled final draft (as it currently is at end of main document) nor refered to it that way on lists.  </s>
<s> - u.s. vs. rest-of-the-world english: just checked w/ communications team at w3c and we do need to bring this in line w/ w3c convention which is for u.s. english spellings.  </s>
<s> affects colour, utilise, realise, internationalisation, etc. Andrew I will forward you a note w/ details from  </s>
<s> W3C's document editor.  </s>
<s> - minor point but quote marks are used inconsistently throughout document, which becomes distracting; almost all of them should be double quotes "..." rather than single quotes '...'  </s>
<s> - WCAG: can't recall if we discussed this in the working group, but the  </s>
<s> references to WCAG should, i believe, all be references to WCAG 1.0, especially since we are specifically referencing WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> W3C's general rule is to reference specs by version number when such exists, unless there is good reason not to, and I don't see good reason not  </s>
<s> to here.  </s>
<s> - general comment but probably not for changing at this point: the frequent  </s>
<s> use of "you" and "your" in addressing the audience throughout the document strikes me as awkward in a number of places, and conversely the one or two areas where that convention is not used (for instance in the section on "assisting access for low-bandwidth users") reads more smoothly to me.  </s>
<s> i think the problem is some cognitive dissonance for me with the notion that every person who reads this document is reading it with regard to their own  </s>
<s> Web site. the audience could actually include Web developers or image consultants, regulatory folks who are curious about the business benefits side of things, etc.  </s>
<s> In a few places the "you" almost seems like talking down to people.  </s>
<s> However, to remove it would involve extensive re-writing, and also probably make it sound dryer.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I'm just pointing this out but am not sure whether we should change that or not.  </s>
<s> Am interested in others' reactions on this question.  </s>
<s> - suggested rewordings: * first paragraph: "to assist in the preparation of a business case for  </s>
<s> implementation of Web accessibility." * second para: "adoption of WCAG checkpoints" (we cannot use the term recommendations here, it is reserved for W3C Recommendations so as not to create confusion) * fourth para: "demographics" instead of "demographic statistics" (redundant)  </s>
<s> * fifth para: "Since one of the underlying tenets of the WCAG is to increase the usability of Web sites..." change to "Since implementation of the WCAG has the effect of increasing the usability of Web sites..." * i still believe that it is misleading to state that "the proportion of  </s>
<s> people with disabilities in the population is up to 20 percent in many developed countries -- a significant market that can be accessed through conformance with WCAG" since it implies that the provisions in WCAG are relevant to this entire demographic.  </s>
<s> they are not, and i believe that it presents a credibility problem for w3c/wai to imply so.  </s>
<s> suggested rewording: "The proportion of people with disabilities can range up to 20% in some populations.  </s>
<s> A significant portion of those people with disabilities -- in some countries as much as 8% to 10% of the overall population -- can benefit from the accessibility in Web sites conforming to  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0." * "cell-phone browsers" suggest changing to "mobile phone browsers" ("cell"  </s>
<s> is less used in many countries" * "also be aware that 8% of the male population" in some countries this is  </s>
<s> 10%; it varies.  </s>
<s> Suggestion: "Also be aware that 8% - 10% of the male population in many countries..." * "From a strategic point of view, anything you can do to increase the  </s>
<s> likelihood that your site will be found over your competitor's is a positive benefit" This seems to imply that all Web sites are run by cutthroat competitors, whereas hopefully the business benefits of accessibility will appeal to non-profits and socially-minded corporations alike.  </s>
<s> Can't figure out how to reword it.  </s>
<s> What about dropping it?  </s>
<s> * under "repurpose content" suggest changing "simply let the differing Web  </s>
<s> devices" to "...diferent Web devices."  </s>
<s> * "The bandwidth savings are astonishing" suggest changing to "The bandwidth savings are immense" (rather than presuming the emotional effect on audience) * "Style sheets vs. HTML tag-spaghetti: we need something that internationalizes better than this... how about "Style sheets vs. in-line markup" * "from WAP phone to PDA's" suggest spelling both of these acronyms out.  </s>
<s> * "with bandwidth becoming an limitation" "...a limitation"  </s>
<s> * "The population is also ageing" "The population in some countries is also  </s>
<s> ageing" * "This includes equal access to electronic information..." "This may include..." - questions: * the first sub-bullet under "clear content" in low literacy levels -- the detail in this paragraph, about the use of short sentences and lists, doesn't this seem to go beyond what WCAG 1.0 actually says?  </s>
<s> if so, we are breaking the thesis of this resource page.  </s>
<s> - misc: * there's an erroneous bulleted line in the "captioning" item under search engine performance  </s>
<s> - tables document: * there are two "to be completed" sections near the end.  </s>
<s> we should have these completed before it goes out for review...  </s>
<s> So, all those were little details... again, the document is looking very good.  </s>
<s> This document represents a great amount of work and will become a very useful resource.  </s>
