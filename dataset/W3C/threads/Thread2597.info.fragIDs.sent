<s> For some long-running operations, it would be nice if a server could send asynchronous notifications to a client, so the client doesn't have to poll (or refresh periodically) to get progress updates.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if something similar to the 100-Continue mechanism could be used for this.  </s>
<s> Maybe with a new status code like 101-Notification.  </s>
<s> A client could send an Expect (or Accept or similar) header to indicate willingness to accept notifications.  </s>
<s> A server could send any number of interim 101-Notification responses, with message-bodies, before sending a final status code.  </s>
<s> 101s would not be sent until the entire request arrives.  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>

<s> You can do this now by sending a single response with a multipart/replace body.  </s>
<s> All it costs is keeping a connection open.  </s>
<s> The more general need is for notifications that do not require an open connection, but that is a different story.  </s>
<s> Great!  </s>
<s> Is the current MIME type still "multipart/x-mixed-replace" (i.e., is it still considered experimental?)?  </s>
<s> Is multipart/replace widely implemented?  </s>

<s> Surendra Reddy and I prepared some Internet-Drafts on a possible Event Notification Protocol, but I think the effort got mired down in trying to come up with the support for a general workflow protocol.  </s>
<s> I'm still interested in a fairly lightweight ENP (TCP/IP-only, request-response only (not store-and-forward also)), as it would help optimize a project we have here at work.  </s>
<s> I don't know when I'll have time to get back to it -- maybe in the 2nd half of this year.  </s>

<s> As you know, presence needs asynchonous notifications as well.  </s>
<s> We are using a protocol for 2 years now which does: 1) subscriptions from client to server 2) notifications from server to client w/o open connection 3) if 2) is not possible, it uses a Unix-select-like mechanism thru HTTP with open connection.  </s>
<s> Notifications travel from server to client while TCP connections are established from client to sever.  </s>
<s> You might have a look into the Internet-Draft: draft-wolf-vpp-01.txt.  </s>
<s> Search for NOTIFY and SELECT.  </s>

<s> Everything is encapsulated into HTTP request-response transactions to be HTTP-proxy compatible.  </s>
<s> We are very happy with the select-mechanism.  </s>
<s> Tell me, if you need more information.  </s>
<s> I can write an Internet Draft.  </s>
<s> Planned this anyway since the HTTP-SELECT experience could be valuable for others as well.  </s>
