In a recent thread related to ALT content guideline, and in several other discussions (whether D-LINK is better achieved using OBJECT or existing feature, for instance), the issue of timelineness has come up, usually in the form of: Are we working out solutions for the short terms (the existing market), for the longer term? 
(the market we want to create) or for both ? 
I'd like to restrict the scope of this discussion to Markup content for now (HTML/XML/CSS evolution and guidelines if you prefer). 
"For both" looks like the ideal answer, but there are constraints on resources on our side when we write specs and guidelines (it takes more time to come up with a solution for more than one context) and more importantly on resources that we think content providers (to take one example) will be able to spend to understand and comply to our recommendations. 
Sometimes, of course, short and future solutions can be exclusive of each others. 
"For the future" is my preferred answer, since it gives us the most liberty to do good design, but it suffers somewhat from a chicken&amp;egg dilemma (who is going to use it and therefore who is going to author using it) and an elitist view. 
"For the short term" has the advantage that our directives are immediately applicable (on many clients) but may carries a load of legacy drawback that might haunt us for year to come. 
I think we need to come up with specific cases were the choice is real and try to understand where we have to go (that reminds me the old adage in the Xlib book: "the only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no example at all") One case: should we spend our resources supporting dumb screen reader (that do not parse the Markup but act on a final presentation made by some other agents) or should we consider that we're working toward making the most out of Markup-aware-agents and only them ? 
For example: a guideline exists that advises content providers to provide ascii version of all HTML forms, since dumb screen readera can't make much sense out of them. 
In this case, we could advocate both, since they are not exclusive, but it is still an issue since it would put the bar higher for accessibility compliance and some people might just drop the ball altogether seeing that it will take too much resources to comply. 
Maybe the answer lies in setting different accessibility level (back to the rating system). 
This is really the kind of discussion I'd prefer to have live, face-to-face or on a conference call. 
I propose that in addition to mail discussion, we organize a phone call to talk about it. 
If you send me you time constraints for next week, I'll try to book something reasonnable. 
to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: Yes, there have been guidelines that write forms off altogether. 
The situation concerning forms and screen readers is not all bleak, however. 
It is possible to make forms mode work through Lynx, for example, and a screen reader with some discipline in the form composition. 
For some examples of forms that the community feels are usable in this technology context, consider: Speech Friendly Search Engines Speech-Friendly Search Engine Query Submission Forms Al Gilman In fall of 1995, Dave Ragget and I worked on a set of extensions to the then proposed HTML 3 to improve the performance of HTML forms with speech interfaces. 
HTML of today fails rather dramatically at providing semantic or syntactic information about a form -- even more so than Graphical Interfaces like Windows; for instance, consider the fact that HTML markup of today has no provision for any kind of association between an input field and its associated label. 
You can read a cleaned up version of what we came up with at Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. 
I assume by "HTML of today" you mean 3.2 or any variant that exists on the market. 
True, but Dave has not been in rest for the past 2 years :-) and he told me recently that most of your past work on FORM has fed into the Cougar spec, albeit with some pain in convincing some of the working group members (with the WAI in place, one could expect that this shouldn't be that hard in the future: we have a common voice now). 
Anyway, in cougar Label - LABEL Grouping - FIELDSET
