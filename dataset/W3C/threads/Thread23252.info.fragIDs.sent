<s> Is there any particular reason NodeIterator has a detach() method and TreeWalker doesn't?  </s>

<s> Because NodeIterator repairs itself as the document changes under it ("list position semantics"), its implementations may involve event listeners or the like which impose a performance burden on the DOM as long as the NodeIterator is active.  </s>
<s> Having a way to deactivate it is therefore important.  </s>
<s> Being able to do so immediately, rather than waiting until the garbage collector (in GC langauges) gets around to cleaning it up, may make a significant difference in application performance.  </s>
<s> TreeWalker's "current node semantics" do not require fixup in response to document mutation, so the same situation doesn't arise.  </s>

<s> The same fixup goes for Range, which also has detachability.  </s>
