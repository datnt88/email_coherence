<s> I believe that EO still has responsibility for them, and are the right group.  </s>
<s> But I do think that any revision must be checked by the WCAG group for technical accuracy.  </s>

<s> While I believe that the quick tips will always conceptually address the issues in any WCAG document for the foreseeable future, I think there may be a time around the later stages of the document (say, in Candidate or Proposed Rec) that we and EO get together and discuss perhaps reordering them.  </s>

<s> That is to say, maybe the content of the Quick Tips itself doesn't need to be changed, but the way it's organized could be modified to harmonize better with WCAG 2. m  </s>

<s> Maybe we could pick out one checkpoint from each that best represents the category.  </s>
