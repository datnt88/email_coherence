I have a div element with text-align:center property if i place a paragraph inside this element, it is correctly centered if i place a table inside the element, it is not centered in Amaya 
but is in other browsers.... what is happening? 
John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or 
[DJW:] Examples needed. 
Inheritance into tables is broken in most browsers. 
text-align does not centre tables, only the inline content of block elements. 
(I think the text within the table cells should centre within the cells, but the table itself should default align, which is, I think, left.) (All bets are off if you styled the table as display: inline-table.) To centre a table, you should use auto left and right margins. 
CENTER has a lot to answer for, it tends to do a mix of both text align and margins. 
(Note that the paragraph doesn't centre, but takes up the full width, as ought to show if you colour it.) There is, however, a problem in Amaya 5.0 NT: fails to action the width propery, and if you use the deprecated method for setting the width, the cell content is not centred. 
Mozilla 0.9.2 appears to work. 
IE 5.01 gets it wrong (it centres the table instead of the cell contents. 
NS 4.75 gets it wrong (it centres the table and ignores the width; with the deprecated, width, attribute, it seems to make the same mistake as IE). 
Web TV Viewer 2.0 gets it wrong (both table and text are centred, and the deprecated width attribute is needed). 
Have you tried to put this table within a div element with attribute align="center", like this: Vincent.
