<s> I just checked the air fares from Hartford to Ottawa, even booking now, for October, it's between $1200 - $1400 US round trip.  </s>
<s> I don't think I'll be able to go on my own just for the face-to-face.  </s>

<s> EOWG: Please reply to jbrewer@w3.org (not the whole list) Tuesday Aug 8 if possible.  </s>
<s> We've discussed at the past three EOWG meetings a possible EOWG face-to-face in Ottawa, Canada, on October 5 and 6, 2000, Thursday/Friday.  </s>
<s> At our last meeting, we appeared to have less of a potential turnout than during our previous calls; however we do not have clear records of who could/couldn't attend from earlier calls.  </s>
<s> Obviously no single date/location will work for all members, and a few members will be attending other WAI meetings in Bristol, UK.  </s>
<s> If you consider yourself an active EOWG member (by the way I will be updating that list soon), please reply tomorrow if you can, regarding whether you can/can't/may attend an Oct 5-6 meeting in Ottawa.  </s>
<s> I need to quickly obtain a rough head-count, and if it appears that we can reach critical mass to get some good work done, we will go ahead with the meeting.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we will need to look for another time later in the fall, as we are already at our maximum on coordinating meetings at the Bristol event.  </s>
<s> (If you use a reply-to-sender instead of group reply when you respond, the whole EOWG list won't get spammed -- thanks.)
