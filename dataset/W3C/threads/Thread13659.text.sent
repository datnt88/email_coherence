Subject: Re: [WW] Use of Textual Graphics on Web Pages I use graphical text a lot because: 1) The client usually has some text in his logo which absolutely must match his printed logo 2) The chance that most web users will have fonts that I specify on their computers (other than arial/helevetica, times new roman, courier, and symbol) are pretty slim, therefore I must make a graphic out of that text. 
3) CSS is still too buggy for me. 
I only use CSS on Intranet sites or other sites where I have control on the browsers and fonts installed on each computer. 
4) I know people with older browsers can't see CSS formatted pages properly (if at all), I do know they can see graphical text or the ALT tags. 
5) Sometimes I need absolute control how much space "text" should take up. 
I then use graphical text. 
6) Sometimes the only graphics on the page are the graphical text nav buttons. 
Without the buttons the page would be too text heavy and too boring. 
7) Maybe this has changed... but don't you need to use images (usually text/images nav buttons) for mouseovers/image swapping? 
9) Looking back on the sites I've done... I've used graphical text on every one.
