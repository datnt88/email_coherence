All, 
This is probably a "newbie" question, but I discovered tidy while trying to figre out how to clean up HTML output from Word-200. 
Tidy does a great job, except for the fact that the links to images are completely removed. 
Am I doing something wrong, or is there an option I haven't set properly? 
Thanks! -- Sherman Mohler 
Using what version of HTML Tidy? 
Could you please send sample code?

Dear Bjorn et al, 
I greatly appreciate your help! 
At the end of this email, I'll go into a brief explanation of the business goal I am shooting for, as you may find it interesting. 
To answer you initial question, when I type "tidy -v" I get the response "HTML Tidy release date: 30th April 2000". 
I am getting this copy from The web page, however, implies there may be a 4th August 200 version somewhere.. perhaps the download points to an older copy? 
I am attaching a jar file with an example of what I did. 
The original hello.doc is there as created by Office 200. 
Also hello.htm from "save as web page". 
The hello_out.html and errs.txt were creating when running tidy with the "word-2000" option. 
If you can help me figure out what I'm doing wrong so I don't lose the references to the graphics, it would be greatly appreciated! 
As to the business goal, I work for "Cisco Learning", which is a non-for-profit that is using the eLearning technology created by Cisco to benefit charitable causes. 
A lot of people have great content trapped in Word and Powerpoint documents, and we need to "suck it" into the eLearning delivery engine. 
My best guess currently as to how to do this is to: 1) Allow the user to "mark up" their documents with some instructions to the delivery engine (ala a simple meta-language) 2) User outputs to HMTL from Word or Powerpoint 3) We covert the meta-language to special HTML markup tags (for later use with tidy's "new tag" capability) 4) Use tidy to scrub the HTML output, along with the "new tags". 
5) Grab chunks of HTML, using the "new tags" as markers. 
6) Load the chunks of HTML into the appropriate XML for input into the delivery engine Six easy steps to success! 
Right?

:-0 Just a few comments to step #1 to #3 in your suggested workflow: If your users are willing to use some constructed tag-set to markup their Word documents, you might instead consider this alternative approach: - Create a set of Word paragraph styles which represents the structure of your documents - Save the styles to a Word .dot 
file which you tell your users to install in their Office installation - Tell them how to use your styleset and Word's own embedded styles to markup the structure of their documents - Tell them to save the documents to RTF, NOT to HTML! - Get a copy of the excellent rtf2html tool (for instance want - Proceed with your step 4 if you want to clean the HTML code any further Some benefits with this approach: + the RTF creation inside Word is pretty stable and good across versions and platforms, HTML creation _is not_ + the HTML creation is done centrally by you, not by the users + you get far better control over all parts of the documemts, including the images Possible downsides: + users must install your styles + Word paragraph styles are simple, and not capable of replacing/mapping advanced tag-sets | Again, many thanks, and kudos for a great tool!

You have a very old versoin of tidy, for the latest build visit I have run your sample through a more recent version of tidy, and the img tag has been preserved as you would expect.

The bug is known, and fixed in the current version (NOT 04 Aug 00) of Tidy : http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=444394&amp;group_id=27659&amp;atid=3909 63 Regards, Terry 
Hi Chaps, 
From watching the list, I realise a lot of work has been going on with Tidy, and this is much appreciated. 
However, do you think you could take a pause sometime soon, and release a new full (GUI) version please? 
Terry - I'm interested in the Macintosh 
version, but I'm sure users on other platforms would also appreciate a new version. 
Thanks again for all the hard work, and a Happy New Year to everyone.

While I am not involved in any GUI for HTML Tidy, I think a new GUI version needs a new HTML Tidy backend and we still haven't released any new version. 
I am working on HTML Tidy in my spare time and I don't have much currently, so this will still take a while. 
Thanks. Wishes!
