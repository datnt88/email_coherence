<s> I think 5 should be 4 and 9 should be 5, both on obverse side; 4 should be 6; 6, 7, and 8 should be 7, 8,and 9 on reverse side.  </s>

<s> The purist answer to 'what about tables for navigation bars (as a side column)' is pretty simple and concrete: pseudo-Guideline: Don't Rational: see use of tables to format text in columns Techniques: Use Frames (but pleaase use them properly with NOFRAMES - it makes life much easier and improves the presentation of your site) How does it improve the presentation?  </s>
<s> Simple.  </s>
<s> I use Lynx as my first-line browser.  </s>
<s> I get to a site that says "Your browser doesn't handle frames.  </s>
<s> You need a frames capable browser to view this site."  </s>
<s> I think to my self "aah, you poor fools.  </s>
<s> If only you knew."  </s>
<s> And I continue on my way into the frames.  </s>
<s> It isn't pretty, it isn't friendly, and it isn't necessary.  </s>
<s> But it isn't usually too difficult either (especially with a navigation frame and a content frame) and it provides certain benefits like the ability to bookmark pages which might be hidden within a frameset.  </s>
<s> (Netscape provides this by the 'open frame in new window' option.) Some people say "well, you can use tables because it doesn't affect many people, and it doesn't affect them very badly".  </s>
<s> Those things are (more or less) true.  </s>
<s> In my mind this doesn't justify the standard approach.  </s>
<s> 99% of the people might be right.  </s>
<s> Then again, they may not.  </s>
<s> There are certain configurations in which the TABLE problem almost vanishes.  </s>
<s> But as a general approach to control of layout, it is bad.  </s>
<s> (and if I use a screen magnifier to double size on a 600x800 browser, a 450 table cell is quite likely going to be REALLY annoying...) Charles' 2c worth  </s>
<s> rob neff I hate to be a stickler for redundant conversation on this.  </s>
<s> How are we providing input to people who use tables that have two columns?  </s>
<s> The example I use is Table Width is 600 Pixels.  </s>
<s> Left column is 150 and contains navigation bars.  </s>
<s> Right Column is 450 and uses the cell width to contain the text.  </s>
<s> When I discuss with people the need to not use tables to format text, then the next question is what about tables with navigation bars.  </s>
<s> Designers can understand not using tables to format tables, but what about navigation bars in HTML 3.2.  </s>
<s> As this is heavily used, these people need to be provided more concrete direction.  </s>
<s> Please note that I do not see "in HTML 4" as the appropriate answer, because, intranets and internets are using HTML 3.2 and some will not go to IE 4. So I need to stress, HTML 3.2 is the bridge for at least another year.  </s>

<s> This discussion should really happen on the GL list, not here.  </s>
<s> I think as a rule, we should only put in this card things that really stable in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> GL: Please see the correspondence below, first my message then Charles McCathieNevile's comments with my original comment.  </s>
<s> This concerns using "tables with navbars" versus not using "tables to format text".  </s>
<s> I feel we are sending mixed messages and if "tables with navbars" as described below are not acceptable, then just about everyone in the Federal Government and commercial world is not in-line with the soon to be published guidelines.  </s>
<s> For the benefit of designers who are designing web sites and who also redesigning web sites, I respectfully request a response.  </s>
<s> I feel this is an area where we need to clarify the WAI's position.  </s>
<s> Very Truly Yours, Robert Neff Rob, can you forward your message to the GL group, since I think you raise a valid point.  </s>
<s> You could also add my 2c worth which is as follows: It is there because you can tell people not to use tabless for layout until you are blue in the face.  </s>
<s> It won't stop them.  </s>
<s> So if they are going to, they could at least try to solve the other problems.  </s>
<s> I agree with you that we may be sending out mixed messages, thereby priveliging the wrong one.  </s>
<s> Charles Understand.  </s>
<s> Then why is this stated as such in the Page Authoring GL, "If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting.  </s>
<s> wai-pageauth-tech.html#tech-table-layout  </s>
<s> For example, in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed centered and in bold.  </s>
<s> Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images, imagemaps, or lists of links.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] " If I am interpreting this properly, then they are stating that it is ok to use tables for these (navbars, frames, images, imagemaps ) but don't use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting.  </s>
<s> I think a stand should be taken so as not to confuse the audience.  </s>
<s> These are questions I am being asked and maybe have convoluted this?  </s>
<s> Could use some help here, rob -----Original Message----- The fact that it is a navbar rather than a columnar paragraph does Not change the problem, which is that the screen is read one whole line (or as near as the reader can get) at a time, so the links are interspersed apparently at random into the text.  </s>
<s> I don't mind seeing it, but having it read to me makes life difficult.  </s>
<s> Charles.  </s>
<s> I would like to see an example where a Table is made with a navigation bar on the left and text in on right where one cell is used.  </s>
<s> Please see my discussion below.  </s>
<s> I feel this would clarify something (navbars and text) that is commonly used.  </s>
<s> I see navbars widely used and they are used in conjuction with multiple text columns and rows.  </s>
<s> For an example, see www.dol.gov http://www.dol.gov http://www.dol.gov http://www.dol.gov  </s>
<s> Please feel free to contact if anyone would like to discuss this further.  </s>
