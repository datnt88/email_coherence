<s> Dear Mr. Teramoto, I have had a quick look at your translation, in particular the top and the bottom.  </s>
<s> Your explanations about the status of the translation and the Working Draft itself look very good.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for all your effort!  </s>
<s> If you can, please also make the top part and the bottom line use a different color background; with a DIV around them and a CSS style rule, that should be easy to do.  </s>
<s> If you don't object, I'll ask the maintainers of the relevant pages on the W3C site to add a link to your translation.  </s>
<s> With kind regards, Martin.  </s>
