Hello everyone, Several weeks ago I took an action item to find real world examples of language changes in websites, to help us with formulating guidelines about identifying the language of a page. 
It has taken me a bit longer to write this than I had expected, I apologize to the group that it has taken so long. 
I have written my findings in the form of an article. 
An illustrated version of the article can be found at: I will include the entire text below. 
Yvette Hoitink CEO Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands --- Examples of language changes in websites --- -- Introduction -- One of the proposed guidelines in version 2 of the Web Content Accessibillity Guidelines is: "Language of content can be programmatically determined". 
A suggested success criteria to meet this guideline is "passages or fragments of text occurring within the content that are written in a language other than the primary natural language of the content as a whole, are identified, including specification of the language of the passage or fragment. 
" This article focuses on some real world examples of the need for the identification of language changes in websites. 
For this article, Dutch websites are used because of the large influence of foreign languages on the Dutch day to day language. 
-- English words in Dutch: a cultural phenomenon -- Dutch is the native tongue of approximately 20 million people worldwide. 
It's the official language of the Netherlands and one of the official languages of Belgium. 
Both countries are very internationally orientated. 
In the Netherlands, English is taught in primary school from the age of 10. 
By the time children finish secondary education, most speak three foreign languages including English. 
Many TV programs in the Netherlands and Belgium are foreign, mostly from the US. 
The programs are subtitled, not dubbed, which exposes the public to a lot of foreign phrases. 
In every day speech a lot of English phrases or words are used, particulary amongst teenagers. 
Also, a lot of the academic literature used in the Netherlands and Belgium is written in English. 
This means a lot of scientific domains use English terminology. 
Even if Dutch words exist, many researchers use the English words either because they are more common or to come across as internationally orientated or well informed. 
- Example 1: Unox commercial - Unox is a Dutch brand which sells traditional foods. 
One Unox commercial shows a manager talking on his mobile phone while filling his tray in a corporate cafeteria. 
Although he is Dutch, he uses almost all English words, or Dutch versions of English words. 
The lady behind the counter looks at him with a vacant, pityful look. 
The only real Dutch sentence he utters is when he asks for a cup of pea soup (a traditional Dutch soup). 
The message is clear: Unox will be Unox. - Example 2: Bullshit bingo - What to do during a boring lecture in management studies? 
Dutch students have found a solution. 
Each person fills in a bingo form, for example a 5x5 grid. 
In every cell you write down a managerial term, typically an English word or phrase. 
For example: "outsourcing", "management by walking around", "commitment", "tackle", "just in time", "business process redesign" etc. 
Each time a word is used during the (Dutch!) lecture, you mark the word on your card. 
The first person to mark an entire row or column is the winner. 
-- Real world examples in websites -- - Selection criteria - To illustrate the need for the identification of language changes in pages, three typical examples of the use of foreign words in Dutch websites have been selected. 
These pages have the following in common: * Their main language is Dutch * The target audience is Dutch * A substantial number of foreign words is used * They belong to a large organization so are expected to remain available for a while - Example 1: Shell - URL: http://www.shell.nl 
The first example is the Dutch division of Shell. 
English words on the Shell homepage: * Home * Sitemap * Directory * Stationfinder * Cadeaushoppen * Global motorsport site * Legal disclaimer * Investor relations * Diversity award * Copyright On first glance, there do not seem to be a lot of English words. 
Most of the navigation items are in Dutch. 
However, most of the page's additional links (Home, sitemap, disclaimer, copyright) are in English. 
This is very common in Dutch websites. 
The Dutch translations of these words either don't exist or are used very rarely. 
Besides these common links, some phrases in the text are in English as well ("global motorsport site", "diversity award"). 
Another Dutch phenomenon can be seen here, the hybrid word "cadeaushoppen" where a Dutch word is glued to an English word, apparently to make it sound more dynamic. 
In the HTML of this page, the main language of the page is indicated as Dutch. 
None of the English words or phrases are marked as such. 
I don't think this page will cause great problems for people using speech synthesizers. 
The English words that are used are either very common, or are not essential for the use of the page. 
- Example 2: Dell support - URL: http://support.euro.dell.com/nl/nl/home.asp, or http://www.dell.nl and then "Ondersteuning" The next example is the Customer support section of the Dutch division of the computer company Dell. 
English words or phrases in the Dell website: * Support * Fix * Upgrade * Customer support * Customer care * Downloads * Quick links * Getting started * Knowledge base * Service call status Most of these are main navigation items. 
Understanding of the meaning of the words is crucial to be able to use the links to navigate the website. 
If these words are pronounced with a Dutch pronounciation, they become very hard if not impossible to understand. 
Dell uses English words even when perfectly good Dutch alternatives exist. 
To me personally, the use of English comes across as excessive and unnecessary. 
Most of the English phrases can not be found in a Dutch dictionary. 
The HTML of the page does not identify what language is used whatsoever. 
- Example 3: Logica/CMG - URL: http://www.logicacmg.nl 
Logica-CMG is a Dutch IT company. 
People playing bullshit bingo would have a great time visiting this site for new inspiration. 
English words on the LogicaCMG homepage: * Solutions that matter * Business services * Energy &amp; Utilities * Fast moving consumer goods &amp; retail * Finance * Media &amp; entertainment * Public sector * Transport, travel &amp; logistics * International Financial Reporting Standards * Human Resource Management * Business Process Outsourcing * Legal * Mobile Traffic Services * Miniseminar portals * Pilot * Mobile ticketing * Business Solutions * Investors This has to be as bad as it gets. 
This page is almost a complete mix of Dutch and English. 
Of the 10 main navigation items, 7 are in English. 
English phrases are mainly used as eyecatchers, for example the navigation items, headings and the slogan. 
Since it's not so much words as entire phrases that are in English, almost none of these can be found in the Dutch dictionary. 
When pronounced with a Dutch pronounciation, a large part of the page becomes hard to understand. 
The language(s) of the page is not identified in the HTML. 
-- Discussion -- We have seen three examples of the use of English words and phrases in Dutch websites. 
The Shell example is what you will find on most Dutch websites: most of the website is in Dutch but some English words are used. 
More and more of these words get incorporated into the Dutch dictionaries. 
This means that at least in theory, they will not have to be marked up as English to be pronounced correctly by speech synthesizers, since they are then part of the Dutch language. 
Even when pronounced with the Dutch pronounciation, these small words such as "home", "sitemap", etc. are so common in websites that most people will understand them anyway. 
The most difficult problems arise when entire English phrases are used in websites. 
This is a growing trend in the Netherlands, particularly in dynamic, internationally oriented areas such as information technology. 
Most phrases used in the CMG example are English and will never be incorporated into the Dutch language. 
Since these phrases tend to be used in important places such as navigation and headings, understanding these phrases is crucial to understanding the page. 
Because most of these phrases contain several words, it becomes very hard to derive their meaning from the context. 
A large section of the website will be mispronounced if these phrases are not marked as English. 
I hope these examples will be helpful for formulating international guidelines for web accessibility. 
These examples are meant to show the accessibility problems that can occur when a lot of foreign words and phrases are used, as is the case in a growing number of websites in the Netherlands.

CEO Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands Written for the WCAG workgroup of the W3C. 
Hi Yvette, first of all, I'm not sure if 'Cadeaushoppen' is an English term (CMIIW), sounds either Dutch or like a made-up word to me. 
-- So, with due respect, I think that this topic is nearly absolutely irrelevant for the WAI work since you only address a phenomenon known in many (European) countries, where anglicisms still become more popular from year to year. 
I also wonder what you intend with your article, do you want to ban anglicisms from your language? 
This ain't a WAI task. 
Do you want to get rid of them in all languages except English itself? 
This ain't a WAI task, either. 
Do you want to encourage authors to highlight each non-native term either visually or semantically (or both)? 
This just won't do (and IMO ain't needed, either, since it ain't your task to block the natural flow of language -- or is it)? 
The entire issue is a thing you should leave to each publisher, and you should instead simply do it better, if you are that concerned about the use of anglicisms (or whatever else) -- me, I often use English terms at work (since there often are no other sufficient terms for some things; even take 'email', should I say 'elektronische Post'?), but when creating articles or using my native language (German), I use them rarely since I know how to articulate. 
Next, better suggest how to associate external sources (e.g. hyperlinks) using other languages than their referrer, and even this is a problem the HTML WG has solved or is about to solve. 
It doesn't matter to me if I misunderstood you, but the entire topic is a thing I've no comprehension for since there are IMHO only people pinning down what is natural. 
It's a self-regulating phenomenon, or do you fear the Dutch language will disappear in 2004? 
Last but not least, I agree (although I didn't see any corresponding and/or explicit statement in your article) that Web site owners may encounter problems using an x language soup on their sites, but this is a thing where neither you nor the WAI WG has any bearing on, this maybe requires only some common sense. 
And maybe you started a biased analysis, scrutinizing only international companies. 
Best regards, Jens. 
PS. Please excuse the provocative tenor in this post, but I claim there are above all several constructive assertions. 
Jens Meiert Interface Architect Hello Jens and list, Thanks for your comments about my article. 
Judging by your remarks, I haven't explained well enough what was my goal with the article. 
A few weeks ago, guideline 3.1 was discussed in the telecon. 
Specifically, we were talking about the need to identify the language, including language changes, since not doing so could lead to serious accessibility problems. 
Wendy and other people mentioned they would like some real world examples of situations where changes in language which were not identified could lead to accessibility problems. 
That's what I tried to do in this article. 
I simply meant to describe different examples of language switches, and briefly touch the accessibility problems that result from those. 
I never meant to ban English words from Dutch (I would be left with a decimated vocabulary myself). 
I totally agree with you that that has nothing to do with WAI. 
I also didn't mean that authors using a lot of English words should reword their websites. 
I just meant to show the accessibility problems that can occur because of this, which _is_ a WAI issue. 
I tried to describe what happens in real life, so WCAG can come up with guidelines to help the authors of that site make their page accessible, English phrases and all. 
I did not mean that people had to rewrite their pages or ban English words. 
Making a page such as the LogicaCMG one accessible would require, in my opinion, that each English phrases is identified as such. 
Also, these examples can be used to see how much effort a certain guideline would mean for some pages. 
Identifying the languages of the LogicaCMG site would require a lot more effort than the Shell example, for instance. 
I will go into some of the points you made in more detail. 
Yes, you're right. 
That's what I tried to explain below that list of English words: "Another Dutch phenomenon can be seen here, the hybrid word "cadeaushoppen" where a Dutch word is glued to an English word, apparently to make it sound more dynamic. 
" FYI: The Dutch language has a powerful mechanism for creating new words, just like other languages such as German do. 
You can simply glue together two words and make a new one. 
"Giftshopping" would be the corresponding English word if English had the same mechanism. 
Such words can be constructed on-the-fly and because of this, many can not be found in dictionaries. 
With a hybrid word such as 'cadeaushoppen', the correct pronounciation would be French for 'cadeau' and English for 'shoppen'. 
Tag that in your HTML :-) My task as I saw it was to come up with examples where language changes would lead to accessibility problems. 
I agree with you that international companies are more likely to use English words and phrases and that this is not a representative sample of Dutch websites. 
But that was not my goal. 
No offense taken, I appreciate any comments about my article. 
Your post helps me to realize I have not succeeded in describing well enough what the purpose of the article was. 
I will wait for further comments and then rewrite parts of it.

[...] Specifically, we were talking about the need to identify the language, Well, can language really cause accessibility problems (more important: when does it not)? 
First of all, each language vocabulary differs from another, second, even every person uses another vocabulary than the other. 
But to diagnose accessibility problems, you need a clear definition of each language vocabulary by defining a standard set of words and terms each native speaker -must- control (can anybody really say what all fellow countrymen understand?). 
Assuming that there is such a virtual standard set for each language, you at first had to decrease the maximum (native) vocabulary about maybe 98% whereby having set a minimum age for this set to about 10 years. 
You also pass on every non-native term to ensure that you can offer that accessibility you want. 
-- What I exaggeratedly show here is that you IMO try to find a way to an ill-defined goal. 
Due to this ill-defined goal, there is no chance for either recommending or banning or judging anything, neither for you nor the WAI WG. Me, I perceive the WAI as an initiative suggesting how you've got fewest problems in reaching your audience, although I understand your feel of maybe powerlessness when noticing a language soup everywhere, but this is normal and (again) self-regulating, and it also supports everyone's ability to -increase- his vocabulary (what a beautiful impact). 
Why? 
Making clear that 'email' is English, or 'Nachricht' ist German? 
Does it make sense? 
-- How? Visually highlighting it to irritate users once more when visiting an almost colored site? 
Semantically pronouncing it to complicate author's work and to allow the desired effect deflagrate? 
Did you really prove that there are accessibility problems or did you merely prove that international companies use a mix of languages? 
-- I think that there are rather -guessed- problems than real problems, or did you test these interfaces? 
Ain't most users also affected by the mix in e.g. advertising, when most of all larger companies use English slogans, everywhere you look? 
Do you want to intervene only related to the Web, or do you want to start a campaign to free the world from all these guessed problems? 
-- Well, maybe I'm wrong, but there are so many issues I see in this case that they are hard to ignore. 
Finally, I recommend to pass on every influence related to language use except when you use e.g. hyperlinks to sources in another language or include cites on your site written in another language (and there already are solutions for these de facto accessibility -- or usability -- problems). 
Best regards, Jens. 
Jens Meiert Interface Architect Hallo Jens, Does it make sense? 
-- How? Visually highlighting it to irritate users once more when visiting an almost colored site? 
Semantically pronouncing it to complicate author's work and to allow the desired effect deflagrate? 
To refer to email as an English word is in Dutch very comfortable for screenreaders because we use the word email (spoken out as a french word) for a sort of iron. 
The official Dutch word for email is just e-mail (electronic mail) and not email. 
On the german wai-list has already been discussed that everything that is not included in your own language officially must be marked up. 
Sitemap is not an official word in German or Dutch and can be pronounced by screenreaders in Dutch as sietemap (ie as ea in sea ,just like bietensap or fietstas). 
Also some german screenreaders seem to pronounce sitemap as sietemap when not marked up as an english word in a german site. 
That can be very confusing and may produce a big accessibility problem in understanding the content of a website. 
Dutch has an official wordlist approved by the governments of the Netherlands and Belgian Flandern, is officially called Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal, but every-one calls it het "groene boekje" (green book) because the color is green. 
I always use this list for my websites. 
When I can not find a word in it, I mark up the word with the xml:lang attribute. 
The word cadeaushoppen is a word that I read for the first time on this list, I don't even know that this word exists. 
Besites I never use the word sitemap in my Dutch sites, but the Dutch equivalent Inhoudsopgave and in a german website Inhaltsverzeichnis. 
Cheers Ineke van der Maat Gegroet Ineke, well, thank you for clarification, but ain't this rather a problem in screenreader programming since these obviously don't represent the (more or less) natural flow and extensions of a language? 
Language is context sensitive (take the email example), and if it's impossible (what I think it is) to develop an application which is really able to understand (not to read) language, this problem will simply never be solved. 
And also imagine there are new or made-up words in a language, should they be ignored since any new e.g. JAWS version doesn't support it? 
And for what version of an e.g. screenreader should an author 'optimize' his site? 
Is it at least realistic? 
Best regards, Jens. 
PS. 
I absolutely agree that this problem exists, but I'm not sure if it can or even should be solved (perhaps even violently, as I perceive these ideas).
