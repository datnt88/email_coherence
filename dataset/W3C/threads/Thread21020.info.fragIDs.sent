<s> (This list has not been very active lately; let me know if discussion of Web annotations has migrated to a different forum and I can repost my question there.) What, if any, will be the social impact of widely deployed third party Web annotation technology?  </s>
<s> By third party I mean annotations that do not require the cooperation of the original Web Site provider.  </s>
<s> So for example, I would not consider a link that a Web Site puts up to a hypermail discussion list to qualify as third party annotation.  </s>
<s> In contrast, I would consider Netscape's Related Links functionality to be a kind of third party Web annotation.  </s>

<s> Rolf, You might want to have a look at my "Adding Comments to the Web" paper, which talks a lot about social impact of annotations technologies.  </s>
<s> It's not exactly a cautious study of possibilities.  </s>
<s> (Okay- it's a foaming-at-the-mouth rant) But it might be of use.  </s>
<s> I'd be really interested in hearing what conclusions you come to about the related-link feature.  </s>
<s> It sounds really interesting from what little I've read, but I haven't had a chance to find out much about it.  </s>

<s> I think the ability to have a third party indicate related links, and then have that ability built into a popular browser, can have some strong positive social impact in terms of allowing people to comment or even start discussions about the material that someone puts on a Web site, as you indicate in your paper.  </s>
<s> It can also make it easier for people to collaborate.  </s>
<s> There is some negative social impact in potential loss of privacy, especially if the service is deployed without proper notice to users.  </s>
<s> Overall though, I think third party annotation is a positive development.  </s>
