Gregg, thanks for posting Take 4! And for the clarifications in yesterday's telecon. 
:Response: Visible and invisible accessibility I find myself increasingly uneasy about the direction in which the reorganization of WCAG 2.0 that Gregg first proposed at the March 2003 face to face is taking us, despite the fact that Gregg's Take 4 represents a substantial improvement over the original. 
As I understand it, at the heart of the proposal is the distinction between "visible" and "invisible" support for accessibility. 
The proposed minimum level would encompass things that enhance accessibility without constraining the default (visual) presentation of the resource. 
The next level would include checkpoints and success criteria that would make demands on the default (visual) presentation. 
This distinction appears to have a number of advantages. 
For one thing, it's clear: if a given accessibility feature is visible to the naked eye it's almost certainly at level 2, while minimum-level requirements are invisible (at least at first glance). 
This invisibiligy is proposed as the second possible advantage: the guidelines might be more palatable if at the minimum level content providers were required to do only those things that enhance accessibility without having to re-consider prevailing design practices or conventions. 
Only developers who chose (or who worked for organizations that chose) to go beyond the minimum level would have to worry about challenging those conventions. 
I'm concerned that this appears to send the wrong message both to content creators and to people with disabilities-it seems to say, accessibility is OK as long as the majority of users don't have to see the things that are done to accommodate the needs of users with disabilities, and as long as developers and designers don't have to change any of the visual design practices that often create accessibility barriers in the first place. 
In other words, guidelines organized on the proposed lines might be read as saying that disability itself is most acceptable when it's least visible. 
Of course this isn't what WCAG 2.0 is intended to convey. 
On the contrary: we are in fact asking developers to do a great deal, both behind the scenes and on the stage, to support a vastly improved level of accessibility-and that accessibility requires action in both places. 
So let's not seem to privilege one above the other. 
I mean this as a practical argument as well as a high-falutin cultural/political one. 
When accessibility features are invisible they're also easier to overlook-even for the people who created them in the first place. 
For example, yesterday I reviewed a site whose home page was entirely graphical (including several images of text). 
The key element in the visual design was an image that changed whenever the user moused over one of several thumbnail-sized images on the right side of the screen. 
This image also functioned as a link to another site which was represented by the image. 
Explanatory text beneath the central image changed whenever that image changed. 
There were several problems: (1) the explanatory text was actually a graphic, with ALT text identical to the image of text on the screen. 
But (2) the ALT text was longer than the JAWS default line length, so the screen reader behaved as if there were two graphics there instead of one (pace Joe Clark, I know this is a screen reader flaw; nonetheless it's an aspect of user experience). 
(3) The ALT text and the HREF for the link associated with the image were hard-coded: they stayed the same even when the image and the (graphical) explanatory text changed as a result of the mouseover. 
There were other issues, too: for example, the placement of the images on the screen made a complete mess of the reading-order as JAWS encountered individual img elements and read their ALT text. 
But the site looked OK (though the graphical text was too small), and things happened visually pretty much the way they were supposed to happen. 
The trouble was all in the invisible stuff-that is, in the accessibility features. 
I fear that this state of affairs will continue as long as accessibility features remain largely invisible. 
I think we need conformance schemes that encompass both "visible" and "invisible" accessibility features.

I am not sure what you are proposing here. 
What Gregg argued at the face to face meeting was that in order for the guidelines to be widely adopted and implemented, it must be possible to conform at a minimum level without imposing constraints on the author's expression and presentational style. 
That is to say, the accessibility would be achieved by way of markup and other forms of machine-readable content, including, potentially but not necessarily, metadata, sufficient to enable highly accessible presentations to be generated by "mainstream" user agents, assistive technologies, or both. 
Now if the main premise of Gregg's argument at the face to face meeting is accepted, namely that guidelines establishing a minimal conformance level that substantially constrained expression or presentation, would not be adopted, perhaps wouldn't proceed so far as a W3C Recommendation at all, then the choice clearly lies between having no guidelines (or widely ignored guidelines), on the one hand, with consequent fragmentation of the standard, and having guidelines which define a minimum conformance level that meets this condition, on the other. 
According to Gregg, and my impression from the face to face meeting is that he is by no means alone in this opinion, the dilemma just outlined is very real. 
If this is true then what option is there other than to establish a minimum conformance requirement of the kind that Gregg's latest definition, based on last week's teleconference, encapsulates? 
While I understand John's unease I don't perceive any alternative, unless one thinks the Web community at large is willing to accept guidelines which, at a minimum, constrain expression or presentation in non-trivial ways. 
Obviously, if there are other options then this would be an ideal moment to put them forward. 
Actually, I am currently considering a conformance idea that would meet the "no constraints on expression/presentation" requirement, but in a qualified sense. 
Specifically, the proposal would be that content could conform minimally to the guidelines without constraining presentation and expression, provided that the author used formats (e.g., markup languages) that were appropriately supported by user agents and assistive technologies, and allowed all of the necessary information to be supplied to enable a high standard of accessibility to be attained. 
If the author were using formats that didn't support the inclusion of the required semantics then the accessibility would have to be provided "directly", that is, by constraining the presentation or expression of the primary content. 
Minimum conformance would then be achieved if either all the semantics were supplied in a format accessible to user agents and/or assistive technologies, including, potentially, server-side technologies, or there existed one or more author-supplied presentations that would meet the requirements defined in the guidelines. 
Under this scheme it is possible to meet the guidelines at a minimal level without impinging on presentation or expression, so long as the content is written in a format or combination of formats from which, in practice, a highly accessible user interface can be automatically generated, and the technology for doing so is available (according to some definition of availability that would need to be worked out). 
For example, Lisa's sample "inaccessible" pages, together with their associated metadata, would qualify under this scheme as minimally conformant. 
There might be a requirement that a link be provided from the home page to the transformation server, but beyond that no constraints on presentation or expression would be imposed. 
Obviously this is only one example of content that might minimally conform and I do not wish to suggest that RDF or other metadata would need to be used in order to achieve minimum conformance. 
Indeed, with appropriate markup, many HTML Web pages would conform also, as would any presentation-oriented content that offered "direct" accessibility (i.e., level 2 of Gregg's definition). 
As I am not sure whether the proposal I have in mind is likely to work, I need to consider it further before discussing it in detail. 
My main point with this message is to sharpen the issues at stake and to open up the question of what our options are, and what kinds of schemes are available for consideration.

Roberto: Hi, an IWA/HWG member has developed an interesting thing for WCAG 1.0 that i think could be implemented: The tool (in Italian, but he is working for english version) let the user to "check" the values of conformity, offering at the end a "page accessibility policy". 
This also could be integrated with languages like EARL and/or using formats like P3P for have an XML document that contain all the conformance checkpoint soddisfed. 
What do u think about?
