<s> An issue has come up in the HTML WG and I'd like to get your input.  </s>
<s> The OBJECT tag, which embeds multimedia in HTML (Java, ActiveX, ShockWave, etc, or plain IMG), has recently lost it's client-side image map support.  </s>
<s> It used to be possible to do:  </s>
<s> A selectable image representing a foo AREA ... AREA ... or even more directly A selectable image representing a foo A coord ... A coord ... but for reasons that are unclear to me (implementation issue apparently), both attributes 'shapes' and 'usemap' are gone, so one would now have to rely on regular IMG to do client-side image map.  </s>
<s> What this means to us is that OBJECT cannot be a long term replacement for IMG, since client-side image maps are so important for accessibility.  </s>
<s> If OBJECT is not a replacement for IMG, the issue of associating long description to images that are used as map might have to be revisited.  </s>
<s> The following is not longer possible: A selectable image representing a foo  </s>
<s> A HREF="foo_desc.html" CLASS=LONGDESC Long description /A available.  </s>
<s> so one might have to rely on a LONGDESC IMG extension: IMG SRC="foo.gif"  </s>
<s> USEMAP="#map1" ALT="A selectable image representing a foo" LONGDESC="foo_desc.html" or on the D link + CSS (and display none): IMG SRC="foo.gif"  </s>
<s> USEMAP="#map1" ALT="A selectable image representing a foo" or some combination of HEAD method and Metadata technique.  </s>
<s> How do people feel about that ?  </s>
<s> PS: on the good side, they haven't added server-side image map to OBJECT :-)  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> I have two suggestions, which I will call the "product" suggestion and the "process" suggestion.  </s>
<s> PRODUCT:  </s>
<s> I think we should follow Murray's advice.  </s>
<s> We need to explain the accessibility scenario where we thought we wanted a USEMAP on OBJECT so they can grasp the accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> What we really need is the capability for more general conditional document content than a simple text string.  </s>
<s> We want at least a conditional hyperlink.  </s>
<s> If they come back and give us an IF-THEN-ELSE control-flow structure where you can have an arbitrary DIV in each branch, we will have enough capability to do better than what we said we wanted to do.  </s>
<s> We should do our best to explain the capability required and explain that USEMAP on OBJECT was the only example we knew about where the required capability was in Cougar.  </s>
<s> PROCESS: I want the W3C to demonstrate that they are prepared to hold the HTML WG accountable for what they do to the accessibility interest.  </s>
<s> That is to say, if HTML WG want to remove something that we said we want, they have to furnish some justification for why they want to eliminate it, and negotiate with us.  </s>
<s> A W3C process where WAI proposes and HTML disposes is simply not acceptable.  </s>
<s> I think the next step is to let the HTML coordination group know that there is a problem.  </s>
<s> The HTML WG has eliminated something that the WAI WG was counting on.  </s>
<s> We should put this on the agenda for 12 or 13 November, and get someone who understands the motivation to eliminate it designated to join the w3c-wai-wg mailing list to discuss options with us.  </s>
<s> I don't think that we should modify what we are asking for until they demonstrate that they are listening.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> I agree completely with Al's comments on this point.  </s>
<s> There would need to be compelling reasons to justify the abandonment of the proposal to allow client side image maps to be specified in OBJECT elements.  </s>
<s> The conditional logic is simple: if the user agent can not process the image map, then it displays the content of the OBJECT element, which would presumably be a list of links, one of which would, if need be, refer to a long description of the image.  </s>
<s> This is a very elegant solution which is completely consistent with the design of the OBJECT element.  </s>
<s> I also agree with Al's "process" suggestion.  </s>
<s> Actually, OBJECT has the potential to provide a much more sophisticated  </s>
<s> approach to image maps than does IMG, even if the LONGDESC attribute is  </s>
<s> added to the latter.  </s>
<s> The content of the OBJECT element can be more than just a simple list of links.  </s>
<s> It might itself include a complete description of the image, with links included in the description that refer to the resources designated by the various areas within the client-side map.  </s>
<s> Thus, the long description is an integrated part of the document, not a separate page, and the links emanating from the image map can be incorporated directly into the description, which would be displayed by default if the user has chosen, or the software is unable to present the image map graphically.  </s>
<s> I don't think trying to do better than what we said we wanted to do is going to help us.  </s>
<s> Asking for control-flow structure at this stage of the HTML4 spec is not wise.  </s>
<s> I agree with your first statement (we need to explain the scenario).  </s>
<s> I'd like someone from the group, not me (that would just be another W3C staff expressing its opinion on the matter, and I think we have enough staff support in the HTML WG currently - that is the industry side we need to convince), to make a short, focus proposal giving rationales why WAI needs this functionality, comparing with what's already there in IMG, or what we could add to IMG.  </s>
<s> This is really a good point.  </s>
<s> e.g.  </s>
<s> This is an image of a plane with a Delta Logo on and it allows you to access the Guide to the service /A or directly go to the page giving the Flight Schedule /A .  </s>
<s> It doesn't look like MAP and AREA (attached to IMG or OBJECT) support this kind of functionality, so now we have to think of what we lose if we don't have it: IMG src="delta-air.gif"  </s>
<s> usemap="#map" ALT="This is an image of a plane with a Delta Logo on and it allows you to access the Guide to the service or directly go to the page giving the Flight Schedule" alt="Guide to the service" /AREA alt="Flight Schedule" /AREA Even with LONGDESC added to IMG, you don't get the integration level of the OBJECT shapes example, in fact, you need to maintain duplicate data in different location, which is known to be a nightmare.  </s>
<s> To me, this is clearly a barrier to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Comments ?  </s>
<s> Daniel's well constructed example illustrates my point exactly.  </s>
<s> Even if LONGDESC is added to IMG, the best that could be achieved would comprise (1) a list of links on the same page as the image map; and (2) a separate long description, which, as Greg pointed out in a previous discussion, could be located either at the end of the current document or in a separate file.  </s>
<s> The long description would bear no direct relationship to the list of links.  </s>
<s> It would of course be possible for the author to include all of the relevant links both in the description and, separately, in ALT text when defining areas within the image map.  </s>
<s> In such a case however, one set of links would become redundant.  </s>
<s> I do not think that authors are likely to make an effort to define ALT text, and then to write a separate description which also incorporates all of the links associated with the image map.  </s>
<s> A single, coherent solution is required, which integrates the need for a long description with the requirement for a textual alternative to the links provided by the image map.  </s>
<s> The OBJECT element provides the only such  </s>
<s> solution that is presently available or proposed, and I do not think that  </s>
<s> modifications to HTTP or image file formats of the kind that have been discussed in this group would serve as a satisfactory substitute.  </s>
<s> Thus, in answer to Daniel's question, I would suggest that loss of the capacity to refer to image maps by means of OBJECT would exclude a solution to the accessibility problem which, as argued above, not only satisfies the needs of users but is also likely to be more acceptable to authors than the redundancy introduced by LONGDESC and ALT text.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Jason White said:  </s>
<s> I see some alternatives to USEMAP on OBJECT that we should be prepared to discuss.  </s>
<s> One is to embed a link to the long description of the image in a client-side map of links.  </s>
<s> [As with all MAP AREAs this would require ALT text.]  </s>
<s> This suggests that IMG+USEMAP can meet minimum requirements, although OBJECT+USEMAP give better capability to say things well.  </s>
<s> The other approach is what, after my conversation with Murray at  </s>
<s> the meeting, I would call metadata-related approaches.  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> involves getting accessibility needs integrated into a more general approach to how information about resources is made available.  </s>
<s> It includes but is not limited to better use of  </s>
<s> fields available in the HTTP response to a HEAD request.  </s>
<s> Building on generic services for meta-information, and adding our voice to the demand that these services work, ultimately involves the lowest cost, in terms of extra effort by authors and webmasters to achieve broad accessibility of their Web  </s>
<s> utterances.  </s>
<s> Note that a metadata approach _does not require_  </s>
<s> changing the HTTP standard in any way.  </s>
<s> But it requires coordinated changes in server and browser behavior.  </s>
<s> The USEMAP on OBJECT strategy requires changes to browser and author behavior.  </s>
<s> Because the risks to success via metadata and via USEMAP on OBJECT are different, there is a risk argument in favor of pursuing both approaches.  </s>
<s> For the non-image things that authors want to put in OBJECT elements -- are we aware of accessibility problems?  </s>
<s> How can those be addressed?  </s>
<s> Do these strategies allow us to meet our need to link to a description of the image _inter alia_?  </s>
<s> If we want to ask the HTML group to re-open the definition of OBJECT, we should be ready with all problems with OBJECT that we know about.  </s>
<s> I think that HTML should implement the USEMAP on OBJECT, unless there are good reasons against it that we don't know yet.  </s>
<s> We should communicate to the HTML group that we need a method of providing links to long image descriptions that works for sensitive maps, not just passive images.  </s>
<s> That's why we liked USEMAP on OBJECT but we are willing to listen to creative alternatives.  </s>
<s> I think the accessibility working group should simultaneously pursue metadata-related approaches.  </s>
<s> We should connect with the people interested in the RDF topic and see how we can work together.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> As Al recognises, this is not a viable substitute for the capacity to include image maps by means of the OBJECT element, due to the degree to which OBJECT allows the links to be embedded within the descriptive text.  </s>
<s> at  the meeting, I would call metadata-related approaches.  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> It would be of interest to know how such an approach would operate concretely to overcome accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> Taking Daniel's example of a description which is to be displayed as an alternative to an image map, with the link to each map area being incorporated directly into the description, how would such functionality be reproduced using a metadata approach?  </s>
<s> From what Al has said, it is evident that metadata may have considerable  </s>
<s> advantages in reducing the effort required of authors in preparing accessible documents.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is a convenient opportunity to consider how such a solution would be implemented.  </s>
<s> I big and interesting question though is: who is expected to prepare the metadata.  </s>
<s> It is always the information provider who is and will stay responsible for: - the accesability of his information - the contents of the information - updates (including removing of old data).  </s>
<s> Metadata can only be used as a "linking" mechanism to be able to locate requested data.  </s>
