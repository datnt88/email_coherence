<s> We should get rid of the hyphen in front of XML in reserved names and attributes.  </s>
<s> "-XML" is ugly, it's hard to type, it looks dumb, and it doesn't really pollute the name space any less than any other reserved string.  </s>
<s> Reserve "XML" and be done with it.  </s>

<s> Does this mean (as I infer and hope) that all XML-* (elements starting with 'XML-') are reserved?  </s>
<s> If so, it should presumably be stated in the XML spec.  </s>
<s> Otherwise the spec will need to list the (?5) reserved element types.  </s>
<s> Would it be a reportable error to have other tags starting with 'XML-'?  </s>
<s> The reason I mention this is that it seems that a managed XML- namespace may be extremely useful.  </s>
<s> I'm NOT making a proposal, but suggest the following scenario.  </s>
<s> We shall shortly create the primordial tag-soup where anything goes, but it is possible that order may evolve out of chaos.  </s>
<s> As an example, I expect lots of authors to create a DATE tag.  </s>
<s> Its semantics could be formalised (perhaps by using the ISO standard) and XML/W3C might play a role in this.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it could evolve through XML-X-DATE (by analogy with unregistered MIME types) to XML-DATE .  </s>
<s> When discussing how we add semantics to elements, one approach (where appropriate) is to develop a set of such information components.  </s>
<s> These could be used in WF documents without the need for a DTD, or alternatively could be bolted into individual DTDs without needing to supply explicit semantics.  </s>
<s> At this stage the question would be whether any/all 'XML-' strings other than those in XML-LINK were reserved, and perhaps whether an XML-X- mechanism was allowed.  </s>
