<s> WL: I believe that it is mandatory to discuss states of the draft as they are reached to help avoid possible oversights and conflicts.  </s>
<s> I believe that it will take far more than the two full days to work on the draft and that a meeting involving AU will constitute "working on the draft."  </s>
<s> I may be the only one who's on five (count 'em 5) Working Groups and even though there is some personnel overlap, the groups do "feel" different.  </s>
<s> It (Bristol) is something to look forward to and prepare for.  </s>
<s> I hope it works out because the WAI's influence on the overall W3C and the strength-through-diversity we're achieving is a great model for just about everything and it's starting to bear fruit.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>

<s> We have not begun registration, but it appears that the core WCAG members (those who have been attending teleconference calls regularly) will be able to attend the WCAG meetings on Thursday and Friday (5 &amp; 6 October).  </s>

<s> Thanks Wendy for this really positive response.  </s>
<s> I do hope I have not gone overboard with enthusiasm, and realise that you may all have a few other matters arising.  </s>
<s> I can gassbag on for ever, but would you all (ok most or even some) like to see some commercial graphics/multimedia software designed to be used by Learning Difficulties clients for authoring.  </s>
<s> I have 2 packages in mind, together with a variety of printed documents, from a number of different sources.  </s>
<s> Also, why Bristol, London is a good bit more convenient for me, and a LD client?  </s>
<s> I might also be able to organise a visit to a LD day centre for interested parties.  </s>
