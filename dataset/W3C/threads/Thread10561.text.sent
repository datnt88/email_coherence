Peter has clarified [1] the status of some of the comments he has made on the LC semantics document: pfps-02 - translation to lbase - pfps notes the ball is in our court. 
pfps-03 - translation to lbase - pfps just doesn't see the need for lbase in the document pfps-04 - rdf closure rules - pfps wants a stronger notion of completeness of the closure rules pfps-05 - rdfs closure rules - again pfps wants a stronger notion of completeness of the the closure rules pfps-06 - xml literals and LV - it is possible the latest docs fix this and we have not pointed this out to pfps. 
Brian [1] Two of Peter's objections concern the translation to LBase. 
I'm wondering whether we might defuse these objections by replacing the LBase appendix with a suitably worded informative reference to the LBase note, e.g. 
An alternative formulation of the semantics of RDF(S) in the form of axioms for the langauge LBase can be found in the LBase specification [ref to lbase note]. 
Brian * Brian McBride bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com [2003-09-25 18:16+0100] I support this. 
While I'm an LBase fan, I could live with such a repartitioning in the interests of finishing our work.

[2003-09-25 13:42-0400] To be clearer: I hereby propose that we amend Semantics as outlined above. 
Dan Me too.

Seconded. 
I will make this change, and move some of the appendix material to the Note to suit.
