<s> Dear Jerry, I am delighted to hear that FP is accessible, even if the pages it produces  </s>
<s> leave something to be desired.  </s>
<s> One problem FP shares with most other graphical editors is that it will, without warning, delete and/or reformat code you put in by hand.  </s>
<s> There is no satisfactory way to defeat this behavior.  </s>
<s> Of course, a the whole point of such a tool is that one should NOT need to know HTML!  </s>
<s> I don't think it unreasonable that such a package be accessible,  </s>
<s> nor is it unreasonable to expect such a tool to produce valid and minimally  </s>
<s> accessible code!  </s>
<s> It will probably be a few years before Microsoft offers such a product.  </s>
<s> Have you tried Amaya?  </s>
<s> Adobe Golive 5 is purported to conform to the WAI.  </s>
<s> It is slated for release any time now.  </s>
<s> Check it out at http://www.adobe.com .  </s>
<s> They are also implementing accessibility in Acrobat and PDF.  </s>
<s> Currently, I use Golive 4, and then run the output through HTML Tidy for Mac, using the XHTML 1.0 spec.  </s>
<s> Works well.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how accessible the interface would be to the visually impaired, though.  </s>
<s> It has good source and "outline" editing modes.  </s>

<s> Correction -- Go Live 4.0 does not conform to WAI.  </s>
<s> The "report" is for a future version.  </s>
<s> Go Live does support CSS and Alt text, but no accessibility prompting or validation.  </s>
<s> There are issues around the accessibility of its interface as well.  </s>
<s> However, Adobe is committed to accessibility of Go Live, Acrobat and PDF as well as other layered products it produces.  </s>
<s> All work in progress at this time.  </s>

<s> Sorry folks but we should be seeing results from this company not more talk that's likely as not devoted to convincing the U.S. federal government that PDF files will be accessible as anything else.  </s>
<s> I'm sure that people will call me Mr. Negative for saying this but PDF files have been one of the worst things for accessibility and if I had a dollar for every person who's blind who's had trouble reading the results of a supposedly converted PDF file, I'd certainly be able to take a nice vacation.  </s>
<s> It is time that people with disabilities stand up and tell the government to quit using PDF until the company demonstrates 100 percent accessibility, not the sham they continue to portray as such.  </s>

<s> Hi All,  </s>
<s> It is not a noble goal.  </s>
<s> Soon for the federal government it will be the law so Adobe better either figure it out or make the information available in a medium that is 100 percent accessible.  </s>
<s> This idea that just trying and doing the noble thing for accessibility has to stop and ensuring accessibility from the beginning has to start.  </s>
<s> Adobe never did that and now they are just prattling on and on about how they are working hard to help the disabled when it is they who created the barrier in the first place.  </s>
<s> Realistically I don't expect much better than the nonsense output we  </s>
<s> currently get from Adobe.  </s>
<s> They might do some slick parlor tricks and get the PDF conversion routines to interact better with screen readers automatically but the fundamental conversions will still be filled with text that's formatted so crazily that much of it is impossible to use.  </s>
<s> Adobe says they'll be creating authoring tools to help address this problem by allowing people to indicate more about a document's structure.  </s>
<s> If you think convincing the bulk of the internet community that adding alt-tags matters, well wait until you try and convince them to add structural information to their documents.  </s>
<s> Hang on.  </s>
<s> Adobe do not try to use accessibility for PR very much.  </s>
<s> I doubt many people know about access.adobe.com  </s>
<s> at all.  </s>
<s> I have found their mentions of accessibility to be quite low-key.  </s>
<s> Also, how are they "responsible for the problem" - PDFs are used usually as supplementary information designed for printing, not primarily for screen reading.  </s>
<s> Contrast this with Flash, which is by and large replacing the entire readable screen content of sites with animations.  </s>
<s> There is no "reader" for Flash, either.  </s>
<s> Again, also check out the way Microsoft behaves.  </s>
<s> They are truly into hype.  </s>
<s> They act as if they are saving the world by being on an accessibility board.  </s>
<s> Just wait until they start crying "Don't break us up, because then we won't be able to make accessible applications (sob)!"  </s>
<s> So they act like this, yet they are the number one cause of inaccessible computing.  </s>
<s> look at the number of companies that are making money selling solutions to problems that should never have been in wiondows in the first place.  </s>
<s> Compare that backwards approach of designing something for visual users, then patching over it with a screen reader, compared to things like Emacspeak where it is designed to be an audio interface from the start.  </s>
<s> Well, gosh, isn't that what XML is all about?  </s>
<s> there seem to be many designers who are very happy about XML.  </s>
<s> E-commerce people seem to love the idea of structuring documents.  </s>
<s> Your argument sounds like you can't win either way.  </s>
<s> Adobe suck because they don't make accessible tools ... but if they were to make accessible tools, you wouldn't like that, because it's too much of a bother.  </s>
<s> Now what is your solution, then?  </s>
<s> Have you ever thought that XML is one of the first relistic ways of implementing accessible structured documents in an open standard?  </s>
<s> If I were Adbobe, I would be incorporating XML into PDF.  </s>
<s> Why wouldn't they, with all the forms and e-commerce type stuff PDF can do?  </s>
<s> Personally, I would rather wait a little bit longer for something that works properly in the first place, than have developers rush quick hacks to market.  </s>
