[You have to have a long memory to put this post in context.] 
In an attempt to determine what would happen if we extended the 'DAV:resourcetype', I tried WebFolders (vintage Win2000Pro 5SP1) against a server that answered a variety of values for resource type. 
The empirical evidence is that resources that answer an non-null value for DAV:resourcetype are always interpeted as type 'Web Folder'. 
For example, I tried the following combo, and the resource shows up as a folder. 
I also tried 'extending' collection as follows: and and they seemed to work ok (i.e., were interpreted as WebFolders and could be opened and browsed, etc.). 
Regards, Tim So does this mean we can extend DAV:resourcetype with nested content? 
This sould simplify some of the resource types introduced by versioning.

Regards, Tim This reinforces the direction we had been pursuing of not using DAV:resourcetype for too much. 
For example, using it to indicate whether or not a resource is a principal would mean that even non- collection principals would show up as folders in WebFolders, which is not good.
