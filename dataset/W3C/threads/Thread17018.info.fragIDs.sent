WebAIM, one of 3 major web-based projects nationally that looks long and hard at the internet and accessibility is having a 5 week free training "event" on web accessibility. 
This is an "anytime" training. 
Information regarding the course is located at: Information regarding WebAIM as an organization and additional resources they have to office is located at: www.webaim.org 
There will be 5 major topics presented interactively over the 5 weeks. 
They are: Week 1: April 1 - 7 The User Experience and Perspective What is web accessibility? 
Understanding user experiences How web accessibility affects people with disabilities Week 2: April 8 - 14 Making the Choice to be Accessible How does accessibility affect you? 
The legal implications of accessibility Business and ethical issues Week 3: April 15 - 21 HTML Development Techniques and Strategies HTML and accessibility validators Creating accessible content using Macromedia Dreamweaver and Microsoft Frontpage Getting 'under the hood' - HTML fixes and strategies from ALT to XML Graphic and Site Design Week 4: April 22 - 28 Multimedia and Advanced Development Techniques and Strategies Creating accessible online PowerPoint Presentations Producing and captioning accessible web video (Quicktime, Windows Media, and RealPlayer) Adobe Acrobat and accessibility Synchronous chats Flash, Shockwave, DHTML, Java, JavaScript, XML, dynamic databases and more Week 5: April 29 - May 5 Institutional Coordination and Reform Processes for bringing about accessibility policy Administrative and development issues They have a movie to summarize the event (QuickTime or Windows Media Player show the best). 
On each Monday, they will have a movie based presentation available. 
Then, Weds will be a live chat, with Friday a live audio chat -- audio streamed with text chat interaction. 
The above page is by no means one of the worst offenders, at least if 
we allow that their promotional video is not essential content, but I'm going to sound off anyway... 
Why can't people who purport to educate on web accessibility at least practice what they preach? 
This one, like so many others, fails at the very first hurdle: it delivers invalid HTML, leaving it to the vagaries of a browser to patch up the mess. 
And - oh the irony - at the bottom of the page in smallprint that becomes legible only by viewing the source, "If you notice any accessibility errors on this site, please tell us!" Nick Kew Site Valet - the mark of Quality on the Web.

My response: Thank you, Nick, for taking the time to evaluate the accessibility of this page. 
I am not the developer directly in charge of the training or the page that you reference, but I am the Technology Coordinator for WebAIM, so I have taken it upon myself to answer your concerns. 
1. 
I'm not sure why you complain about the use of video on the site, since all of the video is captioned, a full transcript is available, an 
audio-only format is available (with descriptions), three video formats are available, two bandwidth options are available for each format, and 
links are provided to help files for those who are unfamiliar with these plug-ins. 
It seems that we have covered all of the bases here. 
If you are going to complain, please do so based on accurate information, so that you do not misrepresent us in a public forum. 
2. At WebAIM we always strive to have valid HTML in our documents. 
This is a high priority for me. 
Unfortunately, a couple of errors were inadvertently introduced, which we have corrected. 
Thanks for pointing that out. 
3. Yes, we do have a link at the bottom of the page which asks people to inform us of any accessibility errors. 
You are right that the link was too small. 
I have enlarged it. 
I decided to leave the rest of the copyright information in the smaller font still, because it is not central to the page content. 
Lastly, considering the fact that we do have a link which invites you to inform us of any accessibility concerns that you might have, why did you not use it? 
We are more than willing to respond to these concerns. 
If we 
were not subscribed to this list, we would not have heard your concerns and would not have been able to address them. 
Next time, please contact us directly.

My last email gives the impression that David Poehlman wrote the rant, when it was actually Nick Kew. 
Sorry, David.

I apologise for being unduly harsh. 
I've been on a rather short fuse for the past few days for (thankfully temporary) health reasons. 
Looking at your page I saw three forms of movie, and by the time I discovered the transcript (why is it 1.7Mb .. oh, that's something else) I was already geared up to flame you:-( I see you've now moved it to be a little more obvious. 
Yes. 
Call me a cynic, but when I see that much packaging, I tend to dismiss the idea that there might also be a worthwhile product. 
Like the old adage whose expression today might be "if you have nothing to say, then say it with powerpoint". 
IMNSHO it's far better to ensure that your pages are automatically validated (BTW, you have now introduced a new validation error). 
Better still to use publishing tools that guarantee good markup. 
See for example URL:http://css.nu/markup/markup-entities.html for an illustration of why validation is necessary but not sufficient. 
Long experience of being ignored - together with a "damned if I'm going to use a link I can't read in my browser" attitude. 
Anyway, FWIW, Page Valet issues a number of accessibility warnings for your page. 
My assessment of those is that the ones at single-A can probably be ignored, but you'd clearly need to fix that presentational markup to earn a double- or triple-A.

Hi Everyone, We're writing the HTML code for the forms of our website, and would like some advice on how to best make the forms accessible. 
What is the proper way to code a description for a form field? 
Option 1: Option 2: 
What is your favorite color? 
color? 
Option 3: color? 
...or something else? 
Thanks so much for your help!

Option 1 should be used when the text is available for the input element. 
Option 2 should be used when the text is not available as a prompt for the 
input element. 
There is no reason to use Option 3. Check out works for three major assistive technologies: Option 4: What is your favorite color? 
Because Screen readers and Home Page Reader will identify the text immediately to the left (or immediately above) an input element as the prompt for that input element.

Option 1a (subject to checking for broken browsers - there are rumours that some get this wrong, although, as the default handling for unknown elements works perfectly well, there is really no excuse): LABEL What is your favourite color? 
I would remodify David's example to do something stupid, but designed to cope with implementations that are widely used but do dumb things and don't do really obvious and simple things. 
label for="colour" What is your favourite color?

Rumours???? Surely we deal in concrete, bona fide, proven-beyond-all-reasonable-doubt stuff here. 
Which browsers and how do they get it wrong. 
Given the prevalence of forms and there importance to e-communications I am quite worried about this. 
Maybe I shouldn't be but I'd like to be reassured.
