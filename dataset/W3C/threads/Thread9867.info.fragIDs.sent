<s> Dan, In the RDFCore telecon d.d. 2002-05-24 agenda item 11 11: daml:collection ACTION:2002-05-03#7 danc summarise to the list the options for collections, with the objections that've been raised (or likelihood that "they'll fly") See: I took the action to create a testcase for this issue.  </s>
<s> The proposed testcase is that parsing ---- test001.rdf  </s>
<s> rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/eg#" would generate following triples ---- test001.nt  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type _:a0 .  </s>
<s> _:a0 http://example.org/eg#intersectionOf  </s>
<s> _:a1 .  </s>
<s> _:a1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#List .  </s>
<s> _:a1 http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#first http://example.org/eg#Person .  </s>
<s> _:a1 http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#rest _:a2 .  </s>

<s> _:a2 http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#first http://example.org/eg#Male .  </s>
<s> _:a2 http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#rest http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#nil .  </s>
<s> Some points of attention are:  </s>
<s> 1/ using namespace xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"  </s>
<s> 2/ using attribute rdf:parseType="collection"  </s>
<s> 3/ just use rdf:Description for collected items  </s>
<s> That's all.  </s>
<s> Jos  </s>
<s> This pretty much works for me (I have a different  </s>
<s> preferences w.r.t. one of your points of attention below...).  </s>
<s> i.e. I'd like to use this to dispatch ACTION 2002-05-24#2 (danc) to write up a proposal for incorporating daml:collection into RDF as well.  </s>
<s> Umm... syntax editors, does this tell you what you would need in order to make the edits?  </s>
<s> That seems to introduce a dependency from RDF syntax to RDF schema.  </s>
<s> I'd rather not do that.  </s>
<s> A new namespace would be the cleanest option, but I think on balance, if we're going to change the syntax, we might as well use this namespace for first/rest/nil/List.  </s>
<s> I'm also uneasy about leaving the semantics of first/rest 'incomplete' at the RDF level; i.e. allowing layered specs to constrain their extents further.  </s>
<s> I think I can live with it, but I'd feel better if I had a more clear picture of the rdfms-assertion and MIME type issues.  </s>
<s> works for me.  </s>
<s> of course, you can use any typednode, right?  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> that's indeed better and I've updated the testcase (see attachements)  </s>
<s> I was also wondering about rdf:item versus owl:item  </s>
<s> right, and then we have some extra triples Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> A real nit.  </s>
<s> The other parse types begin with a capital letter.  </s>
<s> "Collection"?  </s>

<s> "Collection"?  </s>
<s> Brian, I'm fine with that updated version in attachement Jos PS we switched to rdf:List rdf:first rdf:rest rdf:nil in our running code and had no problems so far -- http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/#R30060  </s>
