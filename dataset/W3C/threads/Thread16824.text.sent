Does anyone have any good examples of accessible navigation cascading or expanding menus that are navigable with a keyboard or a mouse? 
Thanks in advance. 
Scott try http://www.provincie-utrecht.nl/ it is in Dutch, but the concept is there. 
see the menus on the left side of the screen. 
tab to item, enter makes a pull down, tab to other items, or enter again on first menu item to close menu. 
works with jaws. 
also works with mouse. 
substitute mouse click for enter.

again on It is however completely reliant on javascript available in small subset of even the javascript capable browsers, even going as far as using the silly a href="javascript:..." links. 
have my attempts, I'm not completely happy with them, but I'm happier than the above one. 
Jim.
