Hi, I have a document I edited with Amaya 6.1 (Mac OS X fink package, Motif version) It created a name/id of "[[Note:" (using create Target), which is not valid.

Hello Charles, I can't reproduce this behaviour (may be bug). 
Could you send me a precise example where it happens. 
Thanks, Laurent 
Hmm. I couldn't repeat it either.
