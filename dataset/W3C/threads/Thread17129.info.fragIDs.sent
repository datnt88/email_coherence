Hi Rob I had a good look at the like - it's pretty good. 
I just wondered - do you have any plans to test for UK/European guidelines? 
Thinking in particular about the SENDA act.

there is no way to test against that.

Hi Rob, I only just got around to doing a quick test. 
I certainly looks quite useful, and the output is simple to browse. 
One thing I miss though: file upload. 
I am working on an application where users must always first login - which means that Cynthia could never test more than the login page (which is about the easiest one). 
Any plans to add a file upload feature? 
I also wondered why 508 is the default choice - that seems inappropriate for a web-wide service. 
WCAG 1 or 2 would be better as a default IMO. 
Or set it to no choice (blank) and require the user to make a choice.

These are excellent points we will look to address ASAP

In fact the point about logging in is more generally applicable too. 
There are many systems behind some sort of login, not least the eCommerce ones where you buy stuff. 
This is a tricky problem because of the many different kinds of interface and approaches to handling logging in - some banking systems having more than one stage for example. 
A useable solution, other than uploading, would be very useful.

perhaps an interface could be added for the purpose of allowing you to log in from Cynthia Says.

Alas, that would (often) not be enough. 
At least not for many sites where login is required: there are many mechanism for logging in to applications. 
While basic authentication (implemented by the web server) could be easily implemented by allowing a username/password part of the URL to be tested, the situations where logging in is implemented by the application itself are far harder to handle and will differ from one application to the next. 
Excepting basic authentication (which actually may already work with Cynthia, although there's a security aspect, of course), once Cynthia *had* logged in, it (she?) would still need to navigate to the page to be tested: depending on the application that may not just be a URL either but involve separate steps. 
While file upload isn't ideal, at least it allows the developer to make a capture of a (generated) page and have that tested. 
I'm currently doing that to be able to test for XHTML-compliance at the W3C validator.

I am trying to teach myself how to construct accessible forms. 
FAILURE. 
I have been wandering around w3.org like a mouse in a maze, losing all sense of direction on this issue. 
I need suggestions and an example of a simple form that is accessible, one that displays different types of form inputs like menu, list, button, text etc. 
Comments on my efforts to date are appreciated, you can see where I am going wrong here: http://members.rogers.com/dm87

Ian Lloyd of accessify.com has many tools including an Accessible Form Builder assistant. 
There is a second version, too, but apparently the page is misssing content for some reason. 
Perhaps it will be back up soon.

It seems to contain quotations from some checkers' reports. 
As the first step, I would suggest _not_ using any checkers before you have a good understanding of accessibility, and then using checkers only with discretion. 
Aim at accessibility, not passing "accessibility tests". 
Use the checkers as tools only, and don't do anything that they say unless you understand what they say and why it would be good for accessibility. 
Your form is very sketchy, but the basic approach is OK. 
You have one label and one field in one paragraph, fine. 
You could alternatively use div and not p markup, since you haven't really got paragraphs there, but that's less essential. 
The essential thing is to have clear structure where it is sufficiently clear what each field is. 
The second part, label for="first name" First Name: size="25" maxlength="45" tabindex="2" is fine except for a small typo: "first name" should be "firstname". 
Computers are picky about spelling. 
For the first part, p Category option selected label="first category" value="FirstCategory" First Category option label="second category" value="SecondCategory" Second Category the problem is just that the you have label attributes that aren't needed (they're to be used for _hierarchic_ menus, as the HTML specifications explain - and this stuff isn't really supported by browsers) and you lack a label _element_. 
You should use a label element in a manner similar to the first part, namely option selected value="FirstCategory" First Category option value="SecondCategory" Second Category I dropped the tabindex attribute, since it's redundant when the ordering of the fields is right, corresponding to the natural filling order.

Well, how can we judge that without a link to your forms? 
That could be taken as a comment about accessibility - and I fancy you're not alone. 
I think you're approaching it the wrong way. 
There's no magic bullet that says Form A is accessible while Form B isn't. 
The basic requirements are (1) users should be able to use the form's fields as intended, even if they don't have the usual equipment (eg a mouse). 
This puts some restrictions on use of javascript in forms; bottom line is the UI should (also) work without it. 
(2) users should be able to identify each form field easily and navigate between them, even if your conventional form layout is lost. 
(3) The overall purpose and function should be clear. 
Ugh. What a ghastly report! 
I'd say that's pretty inaccessible: looks like you have to work hard just to figure out what in your page it's talking about! 
Can I recommend you to my own company's accessibility testing product at URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/ . 
If its reports aren't a great deal more helpful than the one you posted, then it's failing in its purpose.

Donna, I've been asking for working examples for something over 4 years with very little success, though it has to be admitted some. 
thanks so much for your open and honest admission, you'll notice that most respondents are keen to point you in other directions. 
Though any reasonable assumption would be that the standards setting body should put up or sh** up, there seems to be a feeling here, that 'theory' is far more important than practice, and we don't want to get our hands dirty, do we. unfortunately forms are something I know very little about. 
keep pestering for examples, some of w3c's alt tags have to be heard to be believed :-( Jonathan

just an example of a little accessible form in my sense you can do the same with all form elements yoan SIMONIAN Association BrailleNet France 
I would like to thank those who offered advice, and some very good links. 
I have worked my way through the problems I was having with forms, and learned from the experience.
