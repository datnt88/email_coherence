<s> I finally got part of a keyboard file working on Windows NT by noting that people kept speaking of amaya.kb, when the documentation actually says amaya.kbd.  </s>
<s> However, I still note some odd behaviours.  </s>
<s> First, Amaya seems to forget the specified user directory after a OS reboot.  </s>
<s> Second, I can't get various entries below to work, and I haven't a clue why!?  </s>
<s> Some things, like zoom in and zoom below show up next to the menu item (a nice touch that allows me to confirm my mapping) but don't work.  </s>
<s> Other things like spell checking don't show up next to the menu item, and they obviously don't work.  </s>
<s> Interestingly, I did have the zooming in and zooming out, and the Header elements, working at some point, but subsequent changes to the file rendered them inoperative (though show next to the menu item).  </s>
<s> Finally, I can't get keysequences to work at all.  </s>

<s> Tim reported this behavior too under NT.  </s>
<s> I changed the way that Amaya handles its user directories and it should work much better now.  </s>

<s> Ramzi could explain more about that.  </s>
<s> I agree it's a bug but it won't be fixed  </s>

<s> Hi, There is a problem but not really a bug with shortcuts.  </s>
<s> Widows system menu associated with any application has the priority for shortcuts in form of Alt [+ character].  </s>
<s> For example, if you press only the Alt key, the File Menu will be automatically activated.  </s>
<s> To avoid that, we have to "disable" the shortcuts automatically associated with the system menu.  </s>
<s> This needs a lot of work an I prefer to do that in the next release to avoid introducing new bugs in the public release we plan to do.  </s>
<s> Anyway, the shorcuts for Zoom in is the combination of [Alt] and [+] (Where [x] represents the key x).  </s>
<s> In other terms its [Alt]+[Shift]+[+/=].  </s>
<s> The shortcut for Zoom out is: [Alt]+[-].  </s>
<s> And they works if you click into the edit Window.  </s>
<s> Ramzi.  </s>
<s> Understood.  </s>
<s> However, I remapped them to the ctrl key, so there should be no  </s>
<s> conflict, right?  </s>
<s> Oddly, when I remap them back to alt keys they work again:  </s>
<s> Alt Key =:ZoomIn() Alt Key -:ZoomOut() Alt Key 1: CreateHeading1() Alt Key 2: CreateHeading2()  </s>
<s> However, the spelling and multisequence continue to not work, for this reason, or perhaps another reason... Ctrl Key l, Ctrl Key d:CreateDefinitionList() Ctrl Key l, Ctrl Key o:CreateNumberedList() Ctrl Key l, Ctrl Key u:CreateList()  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph,  </s>

<s> again:  </s>
<s> I'll see why Ctrl key + and Ctrl key - do not work.  </s>
<s> This will be fixed soon.  </s>
<s> On Windows, shortcuts are introduced in something called accelerator table.  </s>
<s> This used to be done in a resource file (fortunately, it is not the case for Amaya and this is the reason why you can "dynamically" configure your shortcuts.  </s>
<s> I even can say that the only application on Windows allowing to do this is Amaya).  </s>
<s> The structure of the accelerator table does not allow to combine a sequence "a la emacs" such as Ctrl Key l, Ctrl Key d.  </s>
<s> This is the main reason which lead me to create a particular amaya.kb  </s>
<s> file for Windows.  </s>
