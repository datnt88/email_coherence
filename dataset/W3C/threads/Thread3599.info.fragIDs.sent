Dear all, Thank-you for the input. 
Please let me know if you have any suggestions, deletions or additions. 
Regards, Russ Question: As part of a form, I have a list of terms in a drop-down box. 
Why are they not correctly sorted when I translate the items in the list? 
Answer: 
Although many programming languages have devices like drop-down boxes that have the capability of sorting a list of items before displaying them as part of their functionality, the HTML select function has no such capabilities. 
It lists the options in the order received. 
Thus one must pre-sort their translated options before presenting them to the client. 
This is either done manually or by using some developer-designed process (like using XML and XSLT). 
For example, lets say we have a pull-down list for types of pets. 
In the list, we have the following in alphabetical order: When this is translated to Dutch, the list becomes But for it to be in correct Dutch alphabetical order we will need to re-arrange the list to: This must be done for each language to be displayed. 
Note that the value parameters are not translated in the examples above. 
This separation of material to be displayed to the user and data to be processed at the back-end, allows the developer to keep the back-end processing the same. 
Meaning they do not have to change what they expect to receive from the user every time support for a new language is added. 
Hi Russ, Thanks for getting this back out so quickly. 
I'd like to suggest one small tweak: 
You can run XSLT on the HTML itself, you don't need the data to be in XML, so to avoid making things sound to difficult we could just say 
"developer-designed process (like using an XSLT transform)."

Very small correction (irrelevant for the actual page): You very much NEED the data to be in XML, but it can be XHTML, which is both XML and HTML. 
Regards, Martin. 
Richard, Accepted.
