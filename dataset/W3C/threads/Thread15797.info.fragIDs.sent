<s> My usual strategy of steadfast procrastination in the face of frustration has worked wonders for me once again!  </s>
<s> Really, despite the many suggestions from this group, I had given up on this idea.  </s>
<s> In practice, my job duties changed for a while and I was not able to do much html authoring at all, let alone teach anyone else!  </s>
<s> I am optimistic that I'll be back to working our site at least half time after the new year.  </s>
<s> In anticipation of this I revisited this idea.  </s>
<s> I am pleased to report that Netscape Composer 4.05/4.06  </s>
<s> (and presumably 4.5+ and latter too, I haven't tried) no longer has the unacceptable behavior I reported here some six months ago.  </s>
<s> It is past time to give credit where credit is due.  </s>
<s> The following has been true for some time now, but I have not seen it clearly stated here for the record: Composer will produce html code that sails through both W3C and Bobby validation.  </s>
<s> In May and June I sent a flurry of email to Netscape (and Microsoft regarding FrontPage) and cross posted to several mainstream user group lists.  </s>
<s> I was never given a hint that the two misbehaviors I noted (missing DOCTYPE, &amp;nbsp; after graphics) were legitimate complaints, let alone were being corrected!  </s>
<s> It is only my huge ego that allows me to believe that these concerns were addressed because of me.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much.  </s>
<s> You are quite welcome.  </s>
<s> Composer still coverts EM and STRONG to the the _vastly inferior_  </s>
<s> I and B .  </s>
<s> Possibly more objectionably, it also coverts CITE (and who knows what else) to I as well.  </s>
<s> Composer is still fond of  </s>
<s> superfluous &amp;nbsp; but not so much as to cause Bobby errors.  </s>
<s> Composer favors BR over P when you are writing in the editor, but it no  </s>
<s> longer automatically replaces all P with BR when you edit a preexisting html source.  </s>
<s> Even though all of the above behavior is wrong headed, I can live with these idiosyncrasies.  </s>
<s> This is because of the following advantages: 1)The software is very inexpensive.  </s>
<s> Free is hard to beat.  </s>
<s> Better yet, it's not Microsoft!  </s>
<s> 2)The html editor is very similar to the html browser.  </s>
<s> This makes it user-friendly of course.  </s>
<s> I prefer that a novice composes html with their browser rather than with the built-in html tools of their preferred word processor.  </s>
<s> This avoids all sorts of potential problems (e.g., the mechanics of conversion and posting, documents formatted as a binary WordPerfect file when they LOOK like asci/html) and provides some degree of separation in the user's mind between word processing and html composition.  </s>
<s> 3)The actual mechanics of posting are very simple (click publish) and can be hidden from the novice without the person being given passwords.  </s>
<s> The template pages I will supply folks will include links to the W3C and Bobby validators (pointing to their starter page).  </s>
<s> This facilitates their checking of their page after they have posted it.  </s>
<s> There are potential pitfalls with my (planned) approach.  </s>
<s> 1)The person might not learn html.  </s>
<s> 2)Security is somewhat compromised since we are using an ISP that (of course) provides only one password for our entire site.  </s>
<s> If someone can post stuff regarding their program they can post stuff regarding the entire agency.  </s>
<s> I am not worried about malicious behavior so much as I am accidents.  </s>
<s> I will get around this problem by setting up directories on our site.  </s>
<s> If someone edits and publishes a page from a different department, they will end up with a (modified) copy in their directory that will not have any links to it.  </s>
<s> This whole discussion is only relevant to organizations that have a small number (but greater than one) of people producing modest amounts of html.  </s>
<s> If anyone is in a similar situation (that is, having non-technical people write and publish clean accessible html) I would appreciate hearing from you!  </s>
<s> Do you think using Netscape Communicator suite facilitates this?  </s>
<s> It will still be some time before anyone is helping me with my html work.  </s>
<s> Thanks very much for your time on this.  </s>
<s> FYI, this thread died (on and off the list), so there was no new information for me to share with the group until now.  </s>
<s> Bruce Bailey  </s>
<s> My many thanks to the several people who have responded privately to my initial post.  </s>
<s> I will endevor to ensure that the most salient points are posted here.  </s>
<s> The consensus so far: 1) FrontPage is quirky and you still have to know html to use it.  </s>
<s> 2) It doesn't take much work to correct Communicator pages.  </s>
<s> 3) Other packages MIGHT do the trick.  </s>
<s> I am still not satisfied.  </s>
<s> The beauty of Communicator is that, once it is set up, a neophyte can 1) select "edit", 2) make changes, 3) select "publish" AND THEY ARE DONE!  </s>
<s> The person doesn't have to know anything about ftp or html.  </s>
<s> (For that matter, they don't even need to know a password, but this only works with one account/directory.)  </s>
<s> When you add to this that the person is using software (the browser) that they are already comfortable with, we are talking about a NEAR ZERO learning curve.  </s>
<s> Even editing one line of code destroys the simplicity here.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a way to modify Communicator's behavior?  </s>
<s> Would the commercial versions address this need?  </s>
<s> How is it that no one at Netscape or Microsoft worries about producing html 4.0 compliant code?  </s>

<s> Has anybody had success using Microsoft FrontPage or Navigator Gold to generate html code that parses through Bobby or the W3C Validator without errors?  </s>
<s> I am confortable with html and text editors, but I need to find tools that our secretaries can use without learning html.  </s>
<s> Front Page generates way too much extraneous code and actually makes it difficult to put in good alt text.  </s>

<s> I hate that Communicator favors appearance tags vice logical ones ( B and I instead of STRONG and EM ), but only fails me on two points: 1) It won't include the !DOCTYPE... statement 2) It puts nbsp; after graphics in table cells which causes a Bobby error since my tables now mix graphics and text.  </s>

<s> Here at Butler, we have been training new web authors with Composer for most of a year because 1) It is the only web authoring package the university will buy because a) it is free.  </s>
<s> Kidding aside, just about any one can pick it up because most people climb a steeper learning curve with word processing.  </s>
<s> However, they do not learn HTML and so it helpful -- no essential -- that Netscape is cleaning up its own code.  </s>
<s> I hope that truly happens.  </s>
<s> When I train Composer (or any web authoring), I teach accessibility based upon how they think, organize and write, not on whether they use i or em .  </s>
<s> For the average web author to create accessible pages, we need software that will do the robotic work of creating clean code.  </s>
<s> Composer works well for us, other than the fact that its interface for creating and using tables is extremely clumsy and makes people not want to use tables.  </s>

<s> I and B are presentational -- they assume a certain presentation which doesn't have meaning in all user agents.  </s>
<s> In other words, if you're reading something aloud, you can't put it in italics or bold.  </s>
<s> EM and STRONG, on the other hand, are broader.  </s>
<s> They mean "show this emphasized" or "show this strongly emphasized" and thus leave it up to the browser to determine how it should say something.  </s>
<s> I can emphasize words when speaking out loud, but I can't _italicize_ words while speaking out loud.  </s>
<s> The "preferred way" to do these kinds of things is to use EM and STRONG, and if you need italics or bold, use styles for visual browsers.  </s>

<s> Being one of those "untrained, non-techie people" who has depended on Composer for quite some time, I can vouch for it's effectiveness.  </s>
<s> I've been learning HTML on my own, and, as I learn, I've been weaning myself off of Composer, but it really isn't all that bad.  </s>
<s> Yes, it has a number of bugs (spacing!), but, as a recovering FrontPage user, I'll take the Composer bugs!!  </s>
<s> However, if you check code written by Composer, it'll never pass one of the HTML checkers, like the one one hosted by the W3C page.  </s>
<s> There are too many components that Composer throws in that isn't standard HTML; i.e. the "NO SAVE" feature if you want to leave an image on your page in it's original location.  </s>
<s> It'll pass Bobby and TOM, though.  </s>
<s> I guess you just can't beat the real thing--coding the page yourself.  </s>

<s> It won't break your budget to buy two sites/passwords from your ISP. Keep one for test and integration.  </s>
<s> Only give your fumble-fingered content experts the post-password for that one.  </s>
<s> They could potentially trash one another's play space but you can restore from the pulic site to which you hold the keys.  </s>
<s> They have to check sub-sites in through you.  </s>
<s> This is not a big burden when it is just a tree-replace after you have checked and accepted the stuff on the preparation side of the site.  </s>
