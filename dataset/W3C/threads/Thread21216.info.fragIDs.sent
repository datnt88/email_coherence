Hello: A small feature request to consider: A function to insert the last modification date of the current file. 
I use Amaya a great deal to create UI specifications for our web applications, and this would be helpful.

yes! I write everything with Amaya, specially software specs and docs. 
This feature would be quite useful for reviewing only modified files.

Okay, I noted your request in the wish list. 
It will be considered with the new redesign of the amaya UI. Irene.
