I have been having a little trouble getting what I want past the parser. 
could anyone show me a cleaner piece of code to do what I want at www.peepo.com it looks ok but the code stinks! 
I would also like some air between the words to be found tr /tr tr /tr works but the parser was screaming.

The w3 parser at says "no errors found" Sounds like the parser you're using is the problem.

I don't know if it's recognized in general. 
Which parser claimed your code was bad?

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) the validator is linked from the page, and is the one with the w3c logo (sgml i think).

The W3C validator uses James Clark's SGML parser, which can be downloaded from http://www.jclark.com/ 
I have installed it on my GNU/Linux system and can thus validate HTML documents (or any SGML/XML document for which I have the DTD) wheneer the desire arises. 
The source code of the W3C validator can also be downloaded for installation on a local web server.
