I just conducted the technical half of a day-seminar on XML. 
They gave an ovation at the end (because of excitement about XML, not my fascinating teaching postures :-) They were most impressed with SHOW and ACTUATE. 
I think their view was that these are simple enough to do lots of wonderful things. 
It would make sense, I guess, if XML 2.0 had a link behaviour specification language, I think SHOW and ACTUATE provide nice, generic defaults and they should *definitely* be kept in XML 1.0. 
I am delighted (and not surprised) that Rick's public was impressed by SHOW and ACTUATE. 
They are indeed impressive. 
This is why it is _so_important_ that they not be tied to the link element but be able to be applied through an indirection mechanism. 
In my original submission, I did not argue for SHOW and ACTUATE to be left out of XML 1.0. 
Only that they should be left out of XML_LINK. 
They (or something at least as good) should certainly be in XML 1.0, but they should not be tied to the link element as attributes. 
To make my position quite clear, I take the liberty of reproducing below what I originally said. 
I think you will see from this that I want us to be able to give demos at least as sexy as the ones which impressed Rick's users. 
To have a syntax which allows the degree of richness implied by my examples may have to wait for XML 2.0. 
But to move ACTUATE and SHOW, in their current simple forms, out of XML-LINK and into XML-STYLE should be easy enough to do in XML 1.0. 
This would give Rick the features he wants and me the indirection I need. 
The link is about structure, not about behaviour. 
Consider the following: There is no SHOW, no ACTUATE and no BEHAVIOR attribute on the link elements or their locator subelements. 
To have any of these attributes would be to say _in_the_document_itself_ how the information should be presented. 
But the document should just say what the information _is_. 
The place for presentational instructions is in the stylesheet. 
Having said this, I think it has been extremely useful for the SHOW, ACTUATE and BEHAVIOR attributes to have been placed in XML-LINK _in_this_early_draft_. 
Given that XML-STYLE has not yet been produced, and given that in order to start implementing XML-LINK, there has to be some way to specify how linked information should be presented to the user, putting it in XML-LINK is a valid _temporary_ solution. 
But when XML-STYLE is written, it should include ways of specifying not only typographic, spatial etc. information about presentation of element content, but also behavioural information, both about element content and about links. 
At that time, the SHOW, ACTUATE and BEHAVIOR attributes should be migrated from XML-LINK to XML-STYLE. 
It will then be possible to have stylesheets with the following kinds of result: Under stylesheet 1: The employer's name and business are displayed in the browser window. 
The employer's name is a hotspot which, when clicked, spawns a popup window showing a list of the employees with their names and nationalities Under stylesheet 2: The employer's and employees' names are displayed in the browser window. 
The employer's name is a hotspot which, when clicked, spawns a popup window showing the employer's line of business. 
The employees' names are hotspots which, when clicked, spawn a popup window showing the relevant employee's nationality. 
Under stylesheet 3: The employer's name is displayed in bold type in the top row of a table, spanning two columns. 
The employer's line of business is not displayed at all. 
Subsequent rows of the table show the employees' names in the first column, and their nationalities in the second. . 
and so on 
Jon Bosak has already informed you what the rest of the list knows and will not revisit. 
This topic has been discussed in detail by knowledgable and well-practiced members. 
The design as written is the result of that discussion. 
The relationship between behavior and link structures is understood and documented. 
Given the schedule, now is not the time to revisit this topic as no new evidence has been presented to warrant it. 
Your arguments and David's do not present any new information.

[Daniel Rivers-Moore:] 
You're missing an important point here. 
xml-lang is basic to XML, but xml-link and xml-style are optional modules that may be required for 
some applications but not for others. 
It is very easy to visualize an application like JUMBO that is doing useful things with XML and needs links but is not doing anything that would require a style language. 
Saying that an application has to support a subset of DSSSL just to be able to use links is not acceptable, and we have already concluded that to use links minimally you have to have the SHOW and ACTUATE settings. 
So you will have those two attributes in xml-link no matter what you get later in xml-style.

It should probably also be pointed out that a number of participants argued strongly that information providers need the ability to associate certain fundamental intentions with regard to their links. 
This applied in particular to links that should always, in normal browsing, be traversed without user intervention and displayed to the user. 
True, a style sheet in effect for a particular application (e.g. a robot web crawler) might not always obey such owner intentions; this was recognized and held irrelevant to the key issue, which was the information provider's ability to give an indication of the intentions. 
At this level, these attributes *do* inhere in the link rather than in the style, and so are appropriately defined as attributes of the XML architectural forms.
