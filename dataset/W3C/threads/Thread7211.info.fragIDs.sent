<s> In the past two weeks, there has been significant discussion on whether range locking capability should be included in the WebDAV specification.  </s>
<s> Discussion on this issue can be found in the mailing list archives, available at: Discussion on this issue has taken place in the following threads: "Range locking" "legacy clients" "range locking not used in GroupWise" In my opinion, there exists rough consensus that range locking capability should be considered out of scope for consideration by this group, and hence range locking capability will not appear in either our requirements or specification documents.  </s>
<s> If you disagree, please do so now, otherwise I will consider this issue closed.  </s>

<s> hello.  </s>
<s> By way of introduction, I work as a Program Manager at Microsoft on the Internet Information Server (IIS).  </s>
<s> I am working with Yaron on DAV issues, as well as other web protocols (among other things).  </s>
<s> I too am unaware of source control products that have byte-range level locking.  </s>
<s> However, most OS's that I am aware of do.  </s>
<s> Since one of the practical uses of the DAV methods will be to extend local file systems to web servers, it appears to be very appropriate.  </s>
<s> As far as the cache invalidating argument goes, while certainly it seems to make sense, I don't think resources that are going to be partially locked are going to be necessarily fully read.  </s>
<s> As an example, imagine a web application that maintains a database of information which is implemented as a single file for performance reasons.  </s>
<s> Modifying this over HTTP could be implemented by partial GETs, LOCKs, and PUTs.  </s>
<s> I am failing to understand the objection to keeping range-locking in-scope.  </s>
<s> I think it should be kept in.  </s>
<s> Quentin Clark Program Manager Internet Information Server But few (no?) existing version control systems provide range locking.  </s>
<s> So you'd be breaking new ground -- not necessarily the best thing for a standards body.  </s>

<s> Quentin: Your testimonial not withstanding, the issue is NOT whether "byte range locking" is a useful feature in operating systems.  </s>
<s> The issue is not about the feature at all.  </s>
<s> We're not designing an operating system, we're designing a network protocol for web authoring.  </s>
<s> Or, to quote myself from a private conversation about this:  </s>
<s> You keep on talking about function, and I'm talking about protocol.  </s>
<s> The issue isn't whether the function needs to get exposed, the issue is whether the protocol needs to be aware of it.  </s>
<s> I don't see any good reason why the protocol needs to get more complicated to deal with "byte range locking" when "resource locking" covers it, because a "byte range" can be a "resource".  </s>
<s> The Internet already has many network protocols for file systems.  </s>
<s> WEBDAV is not, and should not become, a network protocol for file system replacement.  </s>
<s> (If that's what you want, why, we already have NFS and CIFS to contend with.)  </s>
