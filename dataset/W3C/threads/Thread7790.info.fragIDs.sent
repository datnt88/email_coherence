<s> Hi, Are there any DAV clients that do a proppatch?  </s>
<s> I have been looking for an example of a proppatch in action.  </s>
<s> Thanks, -David  </s>
<s> Sanity check: have you seen the PROPPATCH example in the RFC?  </s>

<s> If you know Python, then you can also grab my davlib.py and httplib.py  </s>
<s> (via links at www.webdav.org/mod_dav/).  </s>
<s> Using that, you can generate a PROPPATCH to your server.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
