I noticed that Amaya does not set a visited link to a different color than a non visited link ..... but it does display a selected but not activated yet link in red and there seems to be no dialog box for choosing a users default settings for visited and activated links....

To set the default colours use a style sheet. 
on unix it goes in your $HOME/.amaya directory - on windows the directory is listed in the preferences dialogue (I think). 
Then you want amaya.css in that direcxtory, and in that file you want A:visited { color: #abc ; font-style: italic } (or whatever takes your fancy). 
That should probably be part of the distribution though.

Right, Amaya doesn't keep the list of last visited links.
