I saw that a new draft was issued in March, but that's expired, and I can't find anything further. 
Can anyone enlighten me as to the status of this work? 
Thanks, Martin Martin Presler-Marshall - P3P Champion E-mail: mpresler@us.ibm.com 441-4118) We've been trying to get it published as an RFC. 
So far, there has been support within the IESG for making it an Experimental, but that would make it a no-no to reference in standards-track documents. 
Since there are a number of things that would like to use it and go to standards-track, we are trying to get that changed. 
My own personal take on the situation is that there is resistance to anything that encourages more protocols to extend or layer on HTTP because that is viewed as a problem. 
In some ways, I actually share this view, but I also think that since it will happen anyway we should at least provide some guidance on the less-bad ways to do it. 
[in the interest of reducing duplicates, and because this is about the status and not the protocol, I've directed replies only to discuss@apps.ietf.org]

One data point: I asked Keith Moore about the status at WWW8 (May this year), he told me that they were thinking about it, but it did not sound like anything would happen soon. 
I guess I should mention here that I am one of the main proponents of making it experimental only, at least until we have more experience etc, and I have told the IESG so. 
I'm not convinced that using the -ext- framework is superior to just defining some new methods/headers.

Maybe all APPS standards should have experimental, or an equivalent, as a necessary first step in getting to standards track proposed. 
I've wondered about this - maybe groups should have to publish as Experimental, and implement the protocol, before going to Proposed. 
It might get people focused on "running code" sooner rather than later, and some groups need that. 
I'd like to see a few groups try it before recommending it for everyone in APPS. 
I like this response. 
It sounds like a good thing to trial. 
However, its still tough to take the stigma of experimental, would be it possible to have the state called "standards-track experimental"? 
The problem is that many implementors are not interested in implementing things which are marked as "experimental".
