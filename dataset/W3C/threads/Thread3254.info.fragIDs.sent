<s> Hi. In an effort to complete the collection dedicated to Web sites' quality within the W3C QA Library [1] and build a more comprehensive set of resources adapted to all the kinds of actors involved, we have created a simplified outline of the various stages and actors of a Web Site's creation[2].  </s>
<s> This outline may, eventually, become a good guide for readers to find their way among these resources, but for now it can be useful in assessing which documents are yet to be written and which documents need to be amended to be more adapted to their intended audience.  </s>

<s> Hi Jim Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> I've changed the subject line as there are two seperate threads: my documents and my use of XHTML and my reading of the XHTML spec and use of XHTML.  </s>
<s> My first comments are about the spec.  </s>
<s> The document says  </s>
<s> "C. HTML Compatibility Guidelines  </s>
<s> This appendix is informative."  </s>
<s> If you think that's incorrect I suggest the editor of the spec should be  </s>
<s> informed (I guess there's a QA of the spec issue).  </s>
<s> This comment is also about the spec, or rather interpretation of the spec.  </s>
<s> C.1.  </s>
<s> allows you to omit the XML declaration, due to problems with older browsers.  </s>
<s> I've done this.  </s>
<s> C.7 says you need lang: and xml:lang attributes.  </s>
<s> I have the lang attribute in the html element.  </s>
<s> I don't need to give the xml:lang attribute as C.1 allows me to omit it (as I understand it).  </s>
<s> I think I comply with the other requirements (e.g.  </s>
<s> I use br / etc.) - although I can't formally prove this.  </s>
<s> It does occur to me that there's a need for a tool to validate compliance with this section.  </s>
<s> have  </s>
<s> The previous comments are meant to be factual.  </s>
<s> The following comment are subjective and open to debate.  </s>
<s> As stated above, I don;'t thinbk my use of the MIME type is wrong - but may not reflect recommended practices.  </s>
<s> I'd like to implement best practices.  </s>
<s> This will include real world implementation issues and not just the W3C specs.  </s>
<s> I also want to be able to implement solutions which can easily be deployed by others.  </s>
<s> My QA Focus Web site is part of our organisational server.  </s>
<s> The Web site is based on simple use of PHP.  </s>
<s> I manage the XHTMl fragments in HTMLkit.  </s>
<s> We use directory defaults to try to avoid URIs which have gormats encoded in them (cf recent discussion on this list).  </s>
<s> I don't want to change server configuration options which could affect other areas of the Web site.  </s>
<s> So the current approach meant that XHTML resources could be created (and validated) without having to change server configuration options.  </s>
<s> Note that I suspect that some projects that I advise will not be in a position to change MIME types (but this is speculation).  </s>
<s> So I think my approach is better than creating HTML 4 resources.  </s>
<s> If I wish to move to a more appropriate MIME type I'll have to work out how best to do that.  </s>
<s> It may be that I'll need to do something differently with the file suffix or do something in PHP.  </s>
<s> I'd welcome suggestions.  </s>
<s> But going back to the best practices in the real world I think there's need for advice (from this group) on the different approaches to deployment of XHTML.  </s>
<s> This should include advice on whether one should author in XHTML if one has no control over the MIME type (which may be the case with some ISPs) and the pitfalls one may encounter in use of various MIME types.  </s>
<s> Note that an advantage with text/html is that the page will display if the  </s>
<s> XHTML is invalid.  </s>
<s> I think it would be difficult to sell the notion of  </s>
<s> application/xml if an invalid file is not displayed (I appreciate the need for compliance - this comment is about marketing XHTML.  </s>
<s> One could argue that HTML 4.0 is a more fault tolerant format that XHTML (I wouldn't say that but others may).  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> "Brian Kelly" b.kelly@ukoln.ac.uk  </s>
<s> C,  </s>
<s> withdraw  </s>
<s> I agree Appendix C is non-normative, however the MIME-type definition 5.1 is  </s>
<s> normative  </s>
<s> XHTML Documents which follow the guidelines set forth in Appendix C, "HTML Compatibility Guidelines" may be labeled with the Internet Media Type "text/html"  </s>
<s> So whilst Appendix C isn't normative in itself (since you can use  </s>
<s> application/xml or application/xhtml+xml for your XHTML) if you wish to serve it as text/html 5.1 requires it to be.  </s>
<s> This is certainly been my interpretation and it's been discussed here and in other places often enough that I'd've thought someone would correct me on it if it was wrong.  </s>
<s> Ah, I understood the xml declaration was the ?xml  </s>
<s> version="1.0"?  </s>
<s> and that was all you were being allowed to leave out, it had no bearing on C.7, I could be wrong of course, but again, it's been often discussed.  </s>
<s> All of your reasons for serving XHTML how are you, I entirely agree with, and are completely understandable, indeed they're probably required in the real world.  </s>
<s> However you've not given the reason why HTML 4.01 strict is not appropriate for you, it's semantically identical to XHTML 1.0.  </s>
<s> Or what it is about it that makes you not want to author it (a point that I've not yet seen made on this list)  </s>
<s> I'd personally say, this is a huge disadvantage of XHTML as specified, not an advantage of breaking the rules, it doesn't have a method of degrading, the don't display anything in error is a key weakness, and a key strength of HTML 4.01 as deployed.  </s>
<s> I don't think pretending XHTML is really HTML tag-soup and relying on that get us out of trouble if we make a mistake is to be applauded.  </s>
<s> I don't think we should deploy XHTML in any format, unless we have automated publishing tools to actually ensure it's valid, the constraint on invalid - no rendering is too severe a failure, in a document that is mostly correct.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> Brian,  </s>
<s> I really must chime in and agree with Jim about this.  </s>
<s> The point that he and I have been trying to make over some period of time is that the attitude that serving XHTML as text/html and allowing authors to get in the habit of authoring invalid XHTML all the while thinking it is ok will end up destroying the promise that is XHTML.  </s>
<s> One of the great advantages to authoring in XML and XHTML (as application/xhtml+xml) is that the documents must be well formed at the very least.  </s>
<s> To take the position that the requirement of well formed documents is a disadvantage and that any hodgepodge of markup should be displayed is antithetical to the entire idea behind XML.  </s>
<s> As Jim stated, I have not heard a good reason to use XHTML when it is served as text/html, especially when the content is not subject to a strict validation process.  </s>
<s> The reason I brought up the news.com  </s>
<s> site today was to illustrate the Bad Things(tm) that are happening to XHTML because of lack of a commitment to what XHTML really is... XML.  </s>
<s> Why are we recommending XHTML over HTML when all we expecting of the author is that they continue to author HTML as they always have?  </s>
<s> /bc  </s>
<s> Hi Bob Thanks for the email.  </s>
<s> I understand your (and Jim's) rationale.  </s>
<s> I got the impression at the WWW 2003 conference that the problem with dodgy XHTML was to be addressed with XHTML 2.0.  </s>
<s> Anyway I don't have any disagreements with the logic of  </s>
<s> your position.  </s>
<s> I guess my current interest is in the deployment of the application/xml MIME type in a University server environment (typically a mixture of XHTML and HTML; PHP, etc).  </s>
<s> Thinking about it makes me wonder if the advice on format independent URIs ties in with MIME type mapping.  </s>
<s> BTW the reason I'm using XHTML 1.0 is (1) to gain experience of problems - as I'm now finding; (2) to be able to use XSLT to transform the resources (e.g. to RSS) and (3) is the most recent W3C recommendation  </s>
<s> for HTML and its use is preferred (this is my current understanding).  </s>
<s> I get the impression that this (esp.  </s>
<s> point 3) isn't your's (or Jim's  </s>
<s> view).  </s>
<s> I guess your position is that the best approach is XHTML+application/xml (or whatever) and if you can't guarantee to provide the MIME type (for whatever reason) you should stick with HTML 4. If this is felt to be the best approach, shouldn't there be some advice on the QA Library covering this?  </s>
<s> As I pointed out in a previous message the XHTML 1 spec does allow text/html.  </s>
<s> I think additional caveats about the denages of this approach are needed.  </s>
<s> (My apols if this is going over old ground or slightly out of scope for this list).  </s>

<s> "Brian Kelly" b.kelly@ukoln.ac.uk  </s>
<s> Getting a new markup language out won't solve the problem of dodgy XHTML, dodgy XHTML is a user problem, not a standards problem - developers have little incentive to author XHTML valid pages, as there's virtually no cost in authoring invalid ones.  </s>
<s> We can only change this behaviour by providing real benefits in the valid.  </s>
<s> As I see there's 2 options to this, ensure that new UA's don't render invalid XHTML - this is completely unrealistic, UA's need to render content that aren't 100% right, planes don't stop flying just because the lock on the toilet door doesn't work.  </s>
<s> Alternatively the UA's can indicate that it's used some form of fixup, perhaps by not using the users stylesheet or something that provides the content, whilst still making it clear it's not right.  </s>
<s> Whatever we choose we'll only be able to deploy these new User Agents against application/xhtml+xml, text/html is lost - that means tag-soup, and because of that we have to ensure that there's not a large userbase of invalid XHTML ready to be dumped on this unsuspecting XHTML ua - if there is, that UA will have to render it, or people won't use it.  </s>
<s> This is a good reason, but we can still present HTML from XHTML sources, it's just an extra publishing step, this may be too much trouble, but then I don't find XHTML meets my needs as a storage format in any case - I'd rather go RSS- HTML than XHTML- RSS, keeping the storage in the richer semantic format.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> Hi Jim (and Bob) Following your comments about XHTML and MIME types I've written a draft advisory document which takes on-board your suggestions: and a case study which explains why the QA Focus Web site uses XHTML and how we intend to change the MIME types: Comments welcome.  </s>
