<s> I think we have a winner: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/waicard10.htm  </s>
<s> Thanks Harvey for the HTML validity review, it now passes validator.w3.org and is also tidied-up.  </s>
<s> Regarding your comment  </s>
<s> The actual example waicards9snapshot.gif prints (2.4" x 4.2"), about 120% of the US business card (2" x 3.5").  </s>
<s> It looks like the point size in the text of the *.gif is about 11 pt, so the scaling of the gif, up 20%, is consistent with 9 pt at the 2" x 3.5" card size.  </s>
<s> I assume the latter is your objective.  </s>
<s> Yes, the gif is just to show the layout, not the real size.  </s>
<s> It wasn't clear so I modified the sentence introducing the link.  </s>
<s> I have also attached a Color PostScript of the card, which is at real size (gives  </s>
<s> same size as the pilot when I print it).  </s>
<s> (the day we don't need a gif and ps but can only use CSS font-size and other positioning and printing properties to do that dual layout is going to be a great day) Judy, I incorporated most of your comments.  </s>
<s> 3. Images &amp; Animations Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals.  </s>
<s> - I guess I missed something months ago, but I think this works better if we take out "the function of".  </s>
<s> "Function of" works OK for animations, but  </s>
<s> I took the em out on "function" but I insist we keep the word itself.  </s>
<s> It was discussed heavily on the GL list and people really want ALT to indicate which function the visual performs, not to indicate a description of the visual (see my examples to Alan: "search" instead of "little magniflyer glass").  </s>
<s> For purely decorative graphics, the function is nil and ALT="", which is different than no ALT - which is invalid).  </s>
<s> 6. Hypertext Links Use text that makes sense when read out of context.  </s>
<s> No "Click here".  </s>
<s> - there is room to substitute 'Do not use "click here"' so I think we should substitute that, to keep the phrasing flow consistent.  </s>
<s> My intent with  </s>
<s> No "Click here" was to convey some kind of genericity, as in 'No "click here" kinda stuff please'  </s>
<s> I now have  </s>
<s> Hypertext Links: Use text that makes sense when read out  </s>
<s> of context.  </s>
<s> Do not use "click here" for instance.  </s>
<s> Daniel: Before you call it "final" can I suggest that you have a copy editor look review it for writing style?  </s>
<s> The content looks fine, but I think there are a  </s>
<s> couple editorial type issues.  </s>
<s> For example:  </s>
<s> 1. Each term should be set off from the term's definition.  </s>
<s> Use a period or colon.  </s>
<s> 2. For Hypertext Links, reword second statement to: "For example, do not use "click here".  </s>
<s> (not sure whether the period goes inside the quotes or outside in  </s>
<s> this situation.  </s>
<s> Check with an editor.  </s>
<s> 3. For Multimedia, I think you can remove the comma after "descriptions of video".  </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure you can replace the words, "in case" with the word "when".  </s>
<s> 4. For Page Organization, I think you can remove the comma after "lists"  </s>
<s> 5. For Check your work, the statement is not quite clear.  </s>
<s> Change to either, "Use evaluation tools and a text only browser to verify accessibility." or "Use evaluation tools and text only browsers to verify accessibility".  </s>
<s> Sorry for last minute input.  </s>

<s> For someone who has expressed an interest in "freezing" this card I just had a (perhaps absurd?) mild reservation on looking at the finished item: the word "complete" is both adjective and verb and for some reason it struck me funny at 5 AM.  </s>
<s> At first I thought "just leave it out" because *of course* the linked-to guidelines must be *complete* or we wouldn't use them as reference; and of course we aren't asking the reader of the card to *finish* them!  </s>
<s> If we must modify "guidelines" perhaps "full" will do.  </s>
<s> I dunno but on  </s>
<s> balance I still vote to cast the plates and print on.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I'd like to hear from others.  </s>
<s> The bold font only says "this word is important".  </s>
<s> It does not set it off as a term.  </s>
<s> What you have is a Def list.  </s>
<s> Something needs to set those terms off from their definitions.  </s>
<s> If you used a table, it would be space.  </s>
<s> In a compact use like you have on the card, it  </s>
<s> should be a period, colon or dash.  </s>
<s> (That;s it for me.  </s>
<s> I won't argue the  </s>
<s> point anymore).  </s>
<s> I appreciate Judy's comments.  </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing them out.  </s>
<s> I missed them earlier.  </s>
<s> The problem with the phrase "in case" is that it's not an international phrase.  </s>
<s> I see it as "dead wood" (talk about non-international phrases).  </s>
<s> What you're saying when you use the phrase, "in case" is "just in case you forgot"; or, "just in case you overlooked".  </s>
<s> The idea of the card is to deliver statements that people can immediately react to.  </s>
<s> Keep it simple and straighforward.  </s>
<s> While it's true that the statement isn't based on a 100% ratio, most people understand the implication.  </s>
<s> Okay, I'm done for the day.  </s>
