<s> Sorry if this doesn't belong in the DOM forum, but the two addresses available for the XML list from the W3C web site don't work.  </s>
<s> This has to do with parsing XML using Unicode.  </s>
<s> On page 29 of the (printed) specification, (at http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#CharClasses), it says, and I quote:  </s>
<s> Characters which have a font or compatibility decomposition (i.e. those with a "compatibility formatting tag" in field 5 of the database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a " ") are not allowed.  </s>
<s> Question from an implementor of the parser: does this mean xml excludes characters with decompositions altogether (presumably to avoid normalisation issues), or does it mean xml identifiers exclude such characters?  </s>

<s> The constraint is on XML names (identifiers) only.  </s>
<s> Compatibility characters elsewhere in XML documents are only discouraged, not forbidden.  </s>
