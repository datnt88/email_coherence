<s> Hello, Below I include two similar letters to www4mail.  </s>
<s> Both these letters work with version 2.4 (stuttgart; collaborium before switch to version 3), but with version 3 (collaborium now, kabissa) only second letter works.  </s>
<s> I receive no reply at all to the first letter (with more text in textarea and with 8bit characters in it), and the website (groups.yahoo.com)  </s>
<s> doesn't perform requested operation (change of settings of a group).  </s>
<s> I tried many times.  </s>
<s> My mail client can't encode letter body.  </s>
<s> I changed some characters to xxxxx (privacy reasons), but kept number of characters.  </s>
<s> I took into account change of syntax of XFORM command.  </s>
<s> XFORM command I used for version 2.4: XFORM=form method post action "/group/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/settings?cachebuster=on"  </s>
<s> For version 3: XFORM=:post::/group/xxxx/settings?cachebuster=on  </s>
<s> If stuttgart also switches to version 3 then I'll be stuck: the site requires cookies, and idrc and bellanet (version 2.2) don't support them.  </s>

<s> Well, You can try to use the backslash \ character to indicate what lines should be joined?  </s>
<s> Also replace Your New Lines (End of line) with %0D.  </s>
<s> Also try to replace the = character in your HTML code with it's HTML encodings &amp;#61.  </s>

<s> Forgot to mention, This is not a bug.  </s>
<s> It is a side effect probably due to the fact that version 3 gateways try to handle HTML mails from users!  </s>
