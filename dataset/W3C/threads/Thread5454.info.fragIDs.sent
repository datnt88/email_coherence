<s> Leigh, Fantastic minutes.  </s>
<s> Here are a couple of minor corrections in the minutes from the second day.  </s>
<s> I am quoted as saying: Jon Ferraiolo: A clarification.  </s>
<s> The Vodaphone thing is locked; they do not want the W3C to take it over; they want it taken over by a standards organization going forward.  </s>
<s> There is no imperative on the W3C to do a profile.  </s>
<s> But a following Spring2005 thing could take on low-hanging fruit.  </s>
<s> In this quote, various words are missing.  </s>
<s> Regarding: "There is no imperative on the W3C to do a profile", I believe the words "within six months" need to be added to the end of that sentence In the last sentence, I think some words are missing.  </s>
<s> Here is a suggested replacement (suggested new words are indented): But a following Spring2005 or Fall2005 thing is something the W3C could take on and might represent low-hanging fruit."  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Thanks for your amazing work here!!! My stuff are mostly ok... only 2 corrections: 1) Change all "Pediatakis" to "Pediaditakis" 2) Change: "* Web app functionality -- the basic presentation abstractions are an extension mechanism" to "* Web app functionality -- the basic presentation abstractions and an extension mechanism" Thanks, Mike.  </s>

<s> My name is mispelled in both days' minutes, it should be: Charles Ying, Openwave Systems In the section: 2004-06-02.Final  </s>
<s> Session.Straw Poll, my first comment should be changed to: Charles Ying: I think the effort should be smaller.  </s>
<s> Test suites are an excellent start.  </s>
<s> The scope should initially deliver the integration of two fronts -- XHTML and SVG.  </s>
<s> Then we can look at next steps.  </s>
<s> That's for our market; but which standards depends on who is involved in the effort.  </s>
<s> In the section: 2004-06-02.Final  </s>
<s> Session.Straw Poll, my second comment (after TVR's) should be changed to: Charles Ying: Even integrating two core W3C standards (XHTML + SMIL) still needs an accurate conformance test suite and use cases.  </s>
<s> We need to solve issues like this first before addressing additional standards.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Charles  </s>
