Leigh, Fantastic minutes. 
Here are a couple of minor corrections in the minutes from the second day. 
I am quoted as saying: Jon Ferraiolo: A clarification. 
The Vodaphone thing is locked; they do not want the W3C to take it over; they want it taken over by a standards organization going forward. 
There is no imperative on the W3C to do a profile. 
But a following Spring2005 thing could take on low-hanging fruit. 
In this quote, various words are missing. 
Regarding: "There is no imperative on the W3C to do a profile", I believe the words "within six months" need to be added to the end of that sentence In the last sentence, I think some words are missing. 
Here is a suggested replacement (suggested new words are indented): But a following Spring2005 or Fall2005 thing is something the W3C could take on and might represent low-hanging fruit." 
Thanks. 
Jon 
Thanks for your amazing work here!!! My stuff are mostly ok... only 2 corrections: 1) Change all "Pediatakis" to "Pediaditakis" 2) Change: "* Web app functionality -- the basic presentation abstractions are an extension mechanism" to "* Web app functionality -- the basic presentation abstractions and an extension mechanism" Thanks, Mike. 
Thanks to Lee for writing such detailed minutes, they're quite amazing. 
My name is mispelled in both days' minutes, it should be: Charles Ying, Openwave Systems In the section: 2004-06-02.Final 
Session.Straw Poll, my first comment should be changed to: Charles Ying: I think the effort should be smaller. 
Test suites are an excellent start. 
The scope should initially deliver the integration of two fronts -- XHTML and SVG. 
Then we can look at next steps. 
That's for our market; but which standards depends on who is involved in the effort. 
In the section: 2004-06-02.Final 
Session.Straw Poll, my second comment (after TVR's) should be changed to: Charles Ying: Even integrating two core W3C standards (XHTML + SMIL) still needs an accurate conformance test suite and use cases. 
We need to solve issues like this first before addressing additional standards. 
Thanks, Charles
