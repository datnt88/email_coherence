Dear friends, As you know: - Portugal is the first European country where web accessibility is mandatory; - On 8 December 1999 the European Commission launched an initiative entitled "eEurope - An Information Society for All", which propose: "By the end of 2001: The European Commission and Member States should commit themselves to making the design and content of all public Web sites accessible to people with disabilities." 
The eEurope plans are due to be definitively approved at a special EU meeting on employment to be held in Lisbon, Portugal in March 2000 What you think about an online international Petition for the Accessibility on the Internet in European Union supporting the European Commission proposal ? 
You can find an example at http://www.acessibilidade.net/eeurope 
Regards Francisco Godinho Co-ordinator of the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet. 
GUIA/PASIG - Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest Group Great news Ronan ! 
Accessibility on the Internet in European Union Francisco, I am very pleased to hear about the E Europe initiative on 8 December. 
We also had good news in Ireland recently. 
On 16th November, The Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, launched new web design guidelines for the Irish Government and public service. 
These guidelines include the Worldwide web consortium's WAI guidelines for access for people with disabilities. 
The Irish Government's web sites are being revised and we have already noticed improvements! 
We in the Visually Impaired Computer Society of Ireland (VICS) would be delighted to support a petition. 
Ronan McGuirk Excellent idea Francisco! 
You can also count on COCEMFE's support.

(You might like to look at how the Australian Government approaches accessibility). 
Cheres, and good luck. 
(Actually I suspect that hard work and ability will get you success ;-) Charles McCathieNevile Great news Ronan !
