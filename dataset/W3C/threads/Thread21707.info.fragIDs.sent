<s> "An e-mail address, as defined by [RFC822] (the mailbox token, defined in RFC822 section 6.1)."  </s>
<s> First of all, if you're going to refer to an RFC it should probably be RFC 2822 which obsoletes RFC 822.  </s>
<s> Second; please don't force client and server programmers to parse the horrible syntax of an RFC 2822 "mailbox".  </s>
<s> If it's unclear why this is a bad idea, I can come up with a few examples of valid RFC 2822 "mailbox"-es to show how bad it can get.  </s>
<s> Or you can just believe me when i say it's a disaster :-)  </s>
<s> maxlength: "...When this attribute is specified on text or password controls, the server must not submit a form with the control having more..."  </s>
<s> You probably meant to say "..the client must not..."  </s>
<s> Other then that, nice initiative!  </s>

<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> Would you rather require that every form author write a parser instead?  </s>
<s> Currently, forms generally try to validate e-mail addresses and frequently do so in a naive way, leading to many people not being able to use those forms with their e-mail addresses.  </s>
<s> (For example, people with periods in their username.)  </s>
<s> By requiring that the UA do this instead of the author, we reduce the number of implementations that need to be debugged by maybe six orders of magnitude.  </s>

<s> Nope, the idea of having a type="email" attribute for input elements is a good one.  </s>
<s> What I don't like is that the value of this element is defined to be a RFC 2822 "mailbox" The following is a valid RFC 2822 "mailbox": -----[Start RFC 2822 mailbox]----- Bob (You wouldn't think\) Smith "at home)"Johannessen" bob (amazing)db.  </s>

<s> If you're looking for a field to only accept the address, without the display name (bob@db.org, not "Bob Johannessen" bob@db.org ), I'd suggest you specify RFC 2822 "addr-spec" *without* FWS and CFWS.  </s>
<s> If you want to include the display name in the field, use RFC 2822 mailbox *without* FWS and CFWS.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer the former (limited/modified RFC 2822 addr-spec), as I see no reason why the display name can't be expressed in another input element.  </s>
