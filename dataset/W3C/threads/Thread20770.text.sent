I'm not sure it is legal or not but I have added the folowing in a style sheet file: body {xml:lang="fr"; lang="fr"} Then I linked it to my html document. 
But, the spell checker is still working with english. 
It's work fine with the style atribute of body in the page itself. 
I'm runing Amaya 5.2 on win 98. 
And by the way, is there any development made to suport CSS float and clear? 
It's often useful to make the text folow the side of an image. 
Hi Alex, The language should be an attribute of the body element and not a CSS property. 
If you define the body element this way body xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" the Amaya spell checker will use the French dictionary. 
Not yet. 
Tankyou. 
I should have notice that this property wasn't part of the style attribute. 
CSS is used so often in Amaya that I made a mistake. 
By the way, my email adress wasn't correct on my first post it's alex.jasmin@sympatico.ca
