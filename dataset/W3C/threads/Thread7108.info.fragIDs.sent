<s> for the logicians) to take the perspective that there are no 'dangling URIs' that name nothing; and that 404 and DELETE correspond to a lack of information about the named thing, rather than to the named thing not existing at all.  </s>
<s> If the consensus here is that there are some URIs that denote nothing, we ought to take that message back to the RDF groups.  </s>

<s> A name cannot be deleted.  </s>

<s> In another (sub-?) layer URIs are used for "retrieval" of representations.  </s>
<s> Representations can be missing (404), they can be removed (DELETE) or even replaced (PUT).  </s>
<s> Formerly those URIs were called URLs, until it was discovered that every URI can potentially be used for retrieval.  </s>
<s> Now for the term "resource".  </s>
<s> If, as Roy said, the mapping is the resource, then HTTP is not about manipulation of resources but about manipulation of representations.  </s>
<s> In this terminology one could reformulate, e.g. "302 Found" (RFC 2616 10.3.3) from: "The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI..." to "The requested representation can be found temporarily under a different URI..." or "The requested representation is temporarily the same as for another URI and can be retrieved there..." No, this is not a proposal to reformulate RFC 2616.  </s>
