Regarding placeholder and automatically generated or default alt-text. 
Our goals are to: 1. Insure that evaluation tools catch the lack of informative alt-text. 
2. Strongly encourage authors to generate informative alt-text. 
3. Make it as easy as possible for authors to create accessible content, in this case through the inclusion of alt-text registries and other methods of associating alt-text with images when the images are moved or copied. 
Balancing these goals the best compromise may be: Automatic generation of Alt Text: * Tools should only generate Alt text when they are absolutly sure of the meaning (bullets for example) * If a tool does generate Alt text then the tool should inform the user and allow the user to change it. 
Place-holder Alt text: * Tools must not generate place-holder Alt text (ever). 
* Tools can generate a comment line close to the missing Alt text as a reminder - (example ! 
put Alt text here ) 
* Tools should not generate NULL Alt text (Alt=""). 
(Anything inserted into a document has a meaning.) 
As I promised in the call today, here's the URL for the eval version of SoftQuad Software's HoTMetaL PRO 5.0. 
There's a form to be filled out first, of course. 
The accessibility prompting isn't completely up to date with HTML 4.0 yet but I'd be interested in feedback on the way it works. 
Be warned: unless you open files in source mode, HMP will change your code (though it won't lose anything like ALT text, of course). 
It will move things around in an attempt to validate the document. 
Have fun!

Aaargh!!! The registration form is illegible even with my glasses on! 
But now I have got through it and started to download my eval version I'll have a play with it. 
Also, you could tell the people who set up the form that they don't cater for people who are actually interested in evaluating the product, which means that I will be using it in a handful of different scenarios. 
(It says will I be making a personal page or a company page. 
It doesn't have an option for 'I will be evaluating this software', which implies a different usage pattern, so I give answers that aren't sufficiently accurate) Anyway, in about 10 minutes I will get to install it, and then I'll start looking at what we're really interested in. 
(Can I recommend this product to people...) Cheers Charles McCathieNevile 
add "an HTML comment line in the source, close..." so that it's not ambiguous what comment it is about. 
Also, comment are !-- put Alt ... --
