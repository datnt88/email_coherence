I'd like to take a survey on renaming the test cases currently in the repository. 
Anything other than A, E or G would probably require intervention by someone well versed in CVS and with file system access. 
The NIST submitted Level 1 test cases are currently in the repository with all lower case names that provide a summary of the tests (for example, textsplittextnomodificationallowederr.xml). 
Should we: A) Do nothing B) Rename the repository files to MixedCaseNames.xml preserving their current history. 
C) Rename the repository files to camelCaseNames.xml 
preserving their current history. 
D) Rename them to InterfaceNameDD (for example, Node01.xml) preserving their current history. 
E) Rename them to InterfaceNameDD by committing new files and deleting the current files hiding the revision history since Sunday. 
F) Rename them to InterfaceName_FeatureDD (for example, Node_nodeValue01.xml) preserving their current history. 
G) Rename them to InterfaceName_FeatureDD by committing new files and deleting the current files hiding the revision history. 
If we want to do anything, we should do it now before the tests get out. 
Again, Vote +1 for something that you would prefer, +0 for something that you'd go along with, -0 for something that you'd prefer didn't happen but would tolerate, and -1 for something that you are against. 
Any other options? 
My votes: A) +0 B) +0 C) -0 D) +0 E) +0 F) +0.5 G) +0.5 Reasoning: Okay, I didn't follow the rules, I'm only half-hearted on this. 
I think that the shorter names would be more pleasing on test matrixes and other reports.

I'd prefer a compromise between short and mnemonic but I'm slightly concerned that F/G might start to become rather verbose again ("Element_getAttributesByTagName27" is exactly 32 characters.) 
I'm not really concerned about preserving the history right now, since there isn't much history yet to be preserved... 
I haven't looked at the testcase DTD recently, so this may be a dumb question -- Does it allow sufficiently structured internal documentation to build an index of the testcases sorted by interface, feature, and brief description? 
If not, should it? 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Good point. 
It does. 
A test or suite contain a metadata element that contains elements patterned after Dublin Core. 
Each test should contain several subject resource="uri"/ which points to specific passages in the spec. 
Transforms/subjects.xsl will produce a list of canonical URL's for a particular spec. 
A) -0 B) +0 C) -0 D) +0 E) +0 F) +0.8 G) +0.6 Curt, Why do we need to do anything at all? 
Inside each test case is the proper mixed-case name. 
Is this just a matter of things looking nicer on a test matrix, or is there more to it than that?

I guess I have no preference on the test naming scheme.
