Section 2.5 Proposal 2.5.1 
Never remove markup that is recommended for accessibility. 
Techniques: (1) Do not change the DTD without notification. 
(2) Non-critical changes such as attribute ordering may be made without notification. 
2.5.2 Tools should be capable of updating their validation DTD's. 
Techniques: when unrecognized markup is found, the author might be prompted for the Web location of the generating DTD. 
2.5.3 Unrecognized elements and attributes should be preserved until removed by the author Techniques: (1) Unrecognized elements and attributes should not be automatically removed by conversion or housekeeping processses. 
(2) The author may be provided with the option of removing all instances of a particular piece of markup (element or attribute) as long as it is made clear that this markup is "unrecognized", not "purposeless" and it may have an accessibility function.

Department of Zoology University of Toronto JR:: "2.5.3 Unrecognized elements and attributes should be preserved until removed by the author" WL: What if the "author" is a program segment that inserted unrecognized elements? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE If you mean how can we tell flashy-junk from future-access-thing , we can't (without an online DTD registry and the guaranteed on-line authoring that that requires). 
Of course a "program segment" from a tool following our guidelines wouldn't have inserted unrecognized elements. 
So the elements were either inserted manually by the author or were produced by any number of ways prior to editing in the tool. 
Either way, the author should be given final say and if the author isn't qualified to decide then the unrecognized elements should be left alone. 
I don't know if too many novices would appreciate having their authoring tool automatically remove elements from documents they were given to edit.

ATRC I want to point out that although guideline 2.5.1 sounds simple enough, it has enourmous implications for authoring tools. 
The question comes up as to how far the authoring tool has to carry along the unknown markup through the editing process. 
For example: 1) What happens when the unknown markup (or the stuff around it) is edited, copied or moved within the document? 
2) How should cut/copy/paste operations of the unknown markup to other applications be handled (i.e. clipboard operations)? 
3) What about applying new properties to the unknown markup (styles, etc.)? 
4) Should the unknown markup be saved in the application's file format? 
What about saving to formats for previous versions of the application? 
What about saving to other interchange formats? 
I would argue that even if the application can keep the unrecognized markup on import, its presence in the native document is too fragile for it to survive in a meaningful way. 
I like checkpoint 2.5.2 because it gives the authoring tool a reasonable out, i.e. tell the user there is unrecognizable markup on import and let the user decide whether losing that markup makes the tool unusable for their needs or not.
