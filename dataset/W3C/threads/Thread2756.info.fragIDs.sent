hmm.. Wouldnt a prior work be tunneling HTTP through SSL, as originated by Netscape ? 
This is how https works... josh 
rom a quick look at the patent, I expect that previous prior work is widespread; I think this may be an example of overeager patent applications vs. patent examiners that don't know enough computing history. 
But I haven't read the patent carefully, so take this comment with a block of salt. 
Examples: 1) The tunneling of the X Window System protocol through various compression servers, which know how to translate that protocol to a more compact representation and back again. 
This was done by a Stanford prof (name slips my mind, but I can regenerate it) years ago (late 80's is in my mind), and a product version appeared as the Serial Line X work that came out of NCD and the X Consortium well before the application date of the IBM patent. 
The patent claims of "Differencing, caching or protocol reduction techniques increase performance over the external communication link. 
" are certainly present in this system, both differencing and caching. 
2) the tunneling of the IP protocol through chaosnet protocols, done widely at MIT in the 1983 time frame. 
Here TCP's behavior in the face of packet loss (particularly at the time) was mitigated somewhat by Chaos Net's more agressive retransmission strategy. 
3) Both SLIP and PPP do differencing and caching on the TCP/IP headers to increase performance; these have been around for many years. 
The idea, as I understand it, has been around for a long time. 
Examples 1 and 3 above apply most closely, that occur to me without much thought, and long predate the patent application.

But isn't it the building and describing of a 'machine' which receives the patent and not the concept or idea?

Both the X compression and SLIP/PPP stuff have been instantiated into "machines" and used for years. 
The idea has been around for even longer than the implementations..... - Jim 
Further- I just called up and spoke to Barron Housel,one of the inventors listed on the patent, and he agreed that the HTTP over SCP work is prior art; he's going to try and get the issue resolved and get some clarification posted to the working group mailing list Simon Now available - The Freddy Hayek Kayak | "Pass me another elf Paddle Your Own Canoe!
