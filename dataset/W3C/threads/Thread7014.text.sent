Greetings, everyone. 
I joined this list a couple of days ago, but have not seen any activity. 
I also searched the w3c site for any (public) archives, but could not find any. 
I hate posting to a new list until I've had time to align my style with its 'culture', but, since nothing seems to be happening .... 
Is the right place for discussions related to Chris Haynes Hi Chris, There are archives (7+ years) at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/ I'd imagine so, unless there's an IRI list somewhere. 
Go for it!

At: please change the link on: Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) from: to: Note that this new version doesn't yet seem to have made it to: quote cite="http://www.w3.org/International/2002/draft-duerst-iri-01.txt" 
NOTE This document is a product of the Internationalization Working Group (I18N WG) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
For general discussion, please use the www-i18n-comments@w3.org mailing list (publicly archived at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-i18n- comments/). 
For more information on the topic of this document, please also see [W3CIRI] and [Duer01]. 
Dan's remarks concerning the archives of this list are correct. 
And this would normally be a good place to raise comments about the draft you mention. 
But the request from the -01- revision of the Internet-Draft is to use that other list to discuss it. 
So do that. 
OK? Al Hello Chris, Thanks for mentioning the IRI draft. 
A new version has now officially been published, see below. 
Please also have a look at draft-ietf-idn-uri-02.txt, which is related. 
While the main discussion list for both drafts is different from this list, please feel free to raise any issues here that have to do with URIs in general. 
Regards, Martin. 
A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories. 
Title : Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) Author(s) : M. Duerst, M. Suignard Filename : draft-duerst-iri-01.txt Pages : 27 Date : 05-Jul-02 This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement to the URI [RFC2396]. 
An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set [ISO10646]. 
A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs where appropriate to identify resources. 
The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen, instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs, to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software.

This draft is a work item of the Internationalized Domain Name Working Group of the IETF. 
Title : Internationalized Domain Names in URIs Author(s) : M. Duerst Filename : draft-ietf-idn-uri-02.txt 
Pages : 8 Date : 05-Jul-02 This document proposes to upgrade the definition of URIs (RFC 2396) [RFC2396] to work consistently with internationalized domain names. 
A URL for this Internet-Draft is: Martin, Thanks for responding. 
As my concerns are to do with the internationalisation aspects, I gather the other list is the right place to be.
