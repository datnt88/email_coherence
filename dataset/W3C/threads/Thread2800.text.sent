Thanks. 
Now I see how to do a GET with range request. 
Now, another question: Is there a way to specify the offset or range with the http: URL syntax ? 
i.e. something like http://host/dir/file@range=0,500 The real question is how such an addition (to some future http 1.2) would be used. 
I can think of two general cases: 1)Aas a means of obtaining a portion of a resource; such as a single chapter of a long document. 
But one could always just have separate files containing chapter 1, chapter 2,.. ( as complements to the "entire document"). 
Alternatively, a script (cgi-bin or whatever) that would parse the request line, looking for a "@range", and (if found) use the "=0,500" to selectively return a portion of the document, should be fairly easy to create. 
2) As a means of selectively updating a portion of an otherwise large resource. 
For example, acrobat can use a range: header to request selected pages of a long pdf file. 
But this then means having client software (i.e.; browsers) that understand the request syntax being used. 
But there already is a syntax that will support such actions (that is, the aforementioned use of range: request header). 
In other words, although new http methods, etc (such as adoption of a RANGE method) might be useful, I suspect it's not worth the trouble. 
I think the trend in general is to move away from user entered URLs. 
Another trend is away from complex GET URLs and toward use of POST as well as either the Safe: approach or a new idempotent GETX method. 
Also, adding new syntax to the URL has the possiblity of breaking existing implementations because the parsing implementaton if often flakey at best. 
There is no reason that the future should be defined by the limitations of current UIs and HTML attributes. 
I believe the range: approach was orginally conceived to allow a PDF viewer plugin to efficiently transfer portions of the file. 
Two other uses were quickly identified ... recovery of a user interrupted transfer ... quickly getting image meta data for layout purposes w/o waiting for the full transfer. 
The whole range of ways and kinds of pieces users might want to request doesn't lend itself to user entry of byte level encoding. 
There is no reason the current URL scheme can't retrieve whole documents as well as pieces with simple URLs ... outside of the scope of HTTP and URLs, the server implementation defines the interpretation of the URL. 
With a SINGLE data file and/or DB, the URLs could all produce variant levels of zoom into the document. 
This can be achieved today on some servers by creative use of mapping to cgi programs. 
Or an imperceptable alteration of the URL to: could be mapped to an ISAPI DLL on IIS, etc. 
Also, thre are some pretty straight forward improvments to HTML and UIs which would allow better access to the POST and possible GETX methods. 
Links which implement the POST method for example. 
Dave Morris Byte ranges (and indeed line ranges) in URLs have been implemented in the WN server since long before the Range: header. 
They are extremely useful, but are never entered by the user. 
As I said this has nothing to do with user entered URLs. 
The functionality which is missing is the ability to make a link to a subset of a document. 
It can, of course, be done with CGIs, but at great cost in complexity and efficiency. 
Examples: It is useful to be able to create links on server A to parts of documents on server B without server B having CGIs or a database. 
It is useful to create a page of customized links to parts of a single document (e.g. a mail archive) based on a query. 
There are more. 
On the other hand I agree that adding extra complexity to the URL syntax has serious drawbacks also. 
At present much of the URL is opaque and a server can do with it what it wants. 
This is a good thing and allows, for example, WN to implement byte and line ranges in the URL with its own syntax (which users never enter because they don't know). 
The way to have our cake and eat it too is an extension to the HTML syntax which allows one to create a link to a URL *and* specify that a Range header be sent with the request. 
Just for your information the WN syntax is You can see more at http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/range.html
