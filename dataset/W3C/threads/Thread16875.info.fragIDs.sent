Hi, 
We're using tables for layout, and would like to have a picture show on the right side of an article, but have the screen reader read the ALT text of the picture before reading the text. 
Any ideas? 
I know you can do this with CSS2, but due to the use of browsers like Netscape 4.7, as 
far as I know, we can't rely on CSS2. 
We first tried to develop our website by just using CSS1 and CSS2, and not use tables for layout, which worked fine in the newest versions of I.E. and Netscape, but what a mess in the older browsers! 
Therefore, our solution was to use tables for layout. 
We do use CSS1 for font type, size, color, etc. 
The look would be something like: X = text O = picture Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxooooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Thanks, Hy Hy Cohen and Guide Dog, "Layla", hy@miplet.com

I think you don't need tables for layout for that purpose. 
Even if you otherwise use layout tables on the page, you could handle this part simply using Some text. 
br clear="all" /p The align="right" attribute causes the desired effect, if I understood you correctly. 
The tag br clear="all" implies that if the text ends vertically before the image does, empty space is left instead of using it for subsequent text. 
This might be relevant for making the association of the image with some particular text visually clear. 
You might consider using hspace and vspace attributes in img for preventing the text being too close to the image. 
Or you might consider doing such things in CSS. 
You could also use CSS instead of the attributes mentioned (namely float:right for img and clear:both for the element after the paragraph), but that's less relevant as regards to accessibility. 
What I find difficult is just the _opposite_ order: if I'd like to have an image on the left of some text, e.g. as illustrating some verbal explanation or giving an example, I might well wish to have the ALT text be read or displayed _after_ the text. 
In particular, if the image shows an example, it would usually be better to give a corresponding textual explanation after the general text. 
In such situations, I've sometimes considered using a trick: use alt="" for the image, and put another img element, with the desired ALT text and with a dummy SRC attribute (referring, say, to a transparent single-pixel gif), after the text. 
Unfortunately, there is no good structural way in HTML to indicate which part of the textual content an image relates to. 
But putting an img element inside a p , or inside a div , would indicate a logical connection, in a sense. 
(Here I'm worried about the comprehension problems of people who _do_ see the image but cannot understand what it relates to.) Jukka Korpela senior adviser (erityisasiantuntija) TIEKE Tietoyhteiskunnan kehitt?miskeskus
