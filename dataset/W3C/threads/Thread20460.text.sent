ONE: I have used the special / general toolbar item to deselect image download.... however the images continue to download. 
TWO: and i deliberately changed image name so that it would not be found. 
However Amaya did not display the alt attribute, which defeats thepurpose of forcingone to use it.... both are serious errors, one because it removes the ability to stop downloading on slow connections, and two because it interfers with accessibility. 
another issue i have is how to set the text color for the alt attribute when it is part of a anchor. 
On one of my sites it is showing as white on white unless hovered over and then it shows correctly as red. 
This is not an amaya issue (see above as amaya gives nil) but since many here are skilled css coders, they may be able to help John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code by using That concerns only background images. 
This is a not implemented feature but you can see the alt attribute in the alternate view. 
How can I get removed from this list?

It would also be very helpful if the alt/title/longdesc were more easily available in the formatted view instead of only the alternative view. 
This could be achieved with CSS if a few of the CSS2 selectors and properties were implemented, which could also be used for showing things like targets.
