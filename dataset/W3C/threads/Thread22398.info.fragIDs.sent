<s> The following are some comments on the Java DOM interfaces and some follow up based on a discussion with Jonathan Robie.  </s>
<s> I did a simple implementation of the Java DOM interfaces and have some suggestions for corrections.  </s>
<s> Most of these are pretty minor and some are just suggested conventions.  </s>
<s> Corrections OccurrenceType should be an interface and not a class.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you need to put 'static' in front of each of the constants or the constants will not be accessible outside the class.  </s>
<s> Besides handling the static problem, if you make it an interface you can "use" it (use OPT directly without the prefix) with an implements statement.  </s>
<s> All the inner classes should have 'static' in front of the 'class' as  </s>
<s> well as having 'static' in front of the constants.  </s>
<s> If you do not put static in front of the 'class' you are saying the class is embedded within the enclosing class's objects (the objects themselves) instead of just within the enclosing class's namespace.  </s>
<s> Without both 'static's you cannot access any of the constants outside the class's own objects.  </s>
<s> And again I would suggest using interfaces instead.  </s>
<s> Conventional Suggestions I would recommend not using inner classes for the enumerated types.  </s>
<s> This makes them hard to use for clients: if (AttributeDefinition.DeclaredValueType.NAME_TOKEN_GROUP  </s>
<s> == foo) { And hard to see and to extend.  </s>
<s> I would suggest not 'final'ing any classes.  </s>
<s> Note a valid reason to extend them would be to add Object wrappers to them and potentially a list of String names [see below].  </s>
<s> I would suggest suffixing the enumeration class/interface name with 'Constants'.  </s>
<s> This makes them obviously not a real type that someone can implement (e.g. DocumentType) and may help to avoid confusion or collisions with a real-object form of enumeration (where every 'int' is replaced with a single Object).  </s>
<s> It works extremely well for imports also: public class ConnectionTypeFactory implements /*uses*/ ConnectionTypeConstants { Although it is unnecessary, it is a good habit to put 'public' in front of methods in an interface.  </s>
<s> This is solely to aid in copying to and from the implementation of those methods which must be declared 'public' in the class (all interface methods are public, so the class must follow the signature).  </s>
<s> By the way, I strongly applaud using the normal name-space for interfaces/Types.  </s>
<s> I consider this to be far more important than all my suggestions put together.  </s>
<s> Minor Functionality Suggestions It would be nice to have Integer wrappers for all the Enumerated ints.  </s>
<s> It would also be nice to have an array of String names that are being enumerated.  </s>
<s> Beyond this, it might be nice to have a real-object enumeration, but that is a significantly different implementation.  </s>
<s> As an example, my modification to one of the files looks like this: public interface ConnectionTypeConstants { String[] CONNECTION_TYPE_NAMES = {"OR","SEQ","AND"}; int OR = 0; // | int SEQ = 1; // , int AND = 2; // &amp; ?? not in XML Integer OR_OBJECT = new Integer(OR); Integer SEQ_OBJECT = new Integer(SEQ); Integer AND_OBJECT = new Integer(AND); I added an UNKNOWN=-1 NodeType so I could return a nodeType for the DocumentType classes.  </s>
<s> This would seem reasonable or a fuller enumeration of nodeTypes is required.  </s>
<s> Larger/Less-likely Functionality Suggestions There seems to be a number of inconsistencies between the DOM and the Grove model.  </s>
<s> It would seem these two should be more fully aligned.  </s>
<s> I would suggest using more general Collection classes.  </s>
<s> I think have DOM specific collections (NodeLists) and iterators is going to hamper its usefulness.  </s>
<s> Java is already pretty barren (e.g compared to Smalltalk) in terms of collection functionality, but the 1.2 List and Map interfaces and their implementations are likely to be much more functional and be easies to use than the simplified DOM versions.  </s>
<s> === Follow up to the above comments ========================  </s>
<s> I have to say that I've been struggling to find a way to express the enums well.  </s>
<s> Getting rid of the inner classes can be interpreted in two ways - are you saying that it should be taken out of the AttributeDefinition class so that you could say, e.g., if (DeclaredValueType.NAME_TOKEN_GROUP == foo)  </s>
<s> Yes, that is what I meant (not removing them completely).  </s>
<s> I think taking them out is better unless the naming can be made 'Class-relative' (AttributeDefinition.Types.CONSTANT), which I don't think works in this case.  </s>
<s> All the constants could also be placed together in a DOMConstants interface.  </s>
<s> I don't think that is particularly better in this case either.  </s>
<s> I would suggest suffixing the enumeration class/interface name with 'Constants'.... public class ConnectionTypeFactory implements /*uses*/ ConnectionTypeConstants {  </s>
<s> This does increase typing again, bringing us up to: if (DeclaredValueTypeConstants.NAME_TOKEN_GROUP == foo)  </s>
<s> Actually it shrinks the typing to: if (NAME_TOKEN_GROUP == foo) if someone want to 'use' the Constants.  </s>
<s> The above 'implements' effectively imports the Constants and avoids the extra naming.  </s>
<s> The advantage of the 'Constants' suffix is that it make it obvious this is a 'use' and that a ConnectionTypeFactory is not a subtype of a real ConnectionType interface.  </s>
<s> What is the advantage of the Integer implementation?  </s>
<s> Do you know a good way to implement enums that gives me type safety without introducing really cumbersome gunk?  </s>
<s> No, just different types of cumbersome gunk :-) with different benefits.  </s>
<s> I usually enumerate with actual objects, so I would have OccurrenceType: interface OccurrenceType { public int id(); public String key(); // Unique identifier (probably // just the name in this case) public String name(); // e.g. OPT //...The above are standard and usually part // of a more abstract interface... public String symbol(); // e.g. '?' And a registry of the objects based on the id and possibly also the key.  </s>
<s> This "guarantees" that both the object and the type are legitimate for: public void setOccurrence(OccurrenceType occurrence); public OccurrenceType getOccurrence(); It also make OccurrenceType more useful to clients that need to look them up (by key), display them, stick them into collections, use them with Beans, etc.  </s>
<s> The identity test '==' can still be used when comparing them because there should never be more than one of each enumerated value around.  </s>
<s> But that is a slightly "heavier" approach even if it is more useful.  </s>
<s> The reason I put the Integer wrappers around the enumerations was to avoid creating multiple Integer objects (i.e. creating each when I encountered them) when I had to pass the values to other parts of the system.  </s>
<s> Java primitives are second class citizens to all the functionality of class libraries and higher-level programming, and constantly wrapping them is a pain and a performance problem.  </s>
<s> I would love a list of the inconsistencies that you have discovered.  </s>
<s> In general, we want to be close to the Grove model, but it is not completely normative for us, as I understand it.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately I don't think I can do that properly (the Grove spec hurts my brain), and I would think James Clark would be better at this since SP has Grove-like functionality.  </s>
<s> I would suggest using more general Collection classes.  </s>
<s> I think hav[ing] DOM specific collections (NodeLists) and iterators is going to hamper its usefulness.  </s>
<s> Java is already pretty barren (e.g compared to Smalltalk) in terms of collection functionality, but the 1.2 List and Map interfaces and their implementations are likely to be much more functional and be easies to use than the simplified DOM versions.  </s>
<s> Please elaborate on this.  </s>
<s> Well, I understand wanting to minimize the functionality required of a client, but if a language has core interfaces (especially) and classes then clients will expect to be able to use them.  </s>
<s> In pre-1.2 things were pretty barren with only Enumeration being a general interface (and so your Enumerator should really be Enumeration compatible).  </s>
<s> But with 1.2, a core set of Collection interfaces will be available and all the major class libraries will be supporting them.  </s>
<s> People will expect to be able to use these libraries for general collections and not have to constantly wrap them in weaker interfaces to work with a particular library.  </s>
<s> And, for Java, having specific-type list interfaces is not worth it.  </s>
<s> Without template support clients are always having to cast (typecheck) anyway for subtypes placed in the original list.  </s>
<s> So considering that the DOM is coming out as 1.2 is coming out, I would suggest you assume the 1.2 interfaces exist (or bundle your own copy/package of them) and use List/Map/Iterator instead of your own NodeList, NamedNodeList, Enumerator, and the old util.Vector.  </s>
<s> By the way, I use a convention of a comment immediately after the collection to identify the collection element type: List /*of Attribute*/ getAttributes(); Oh, I see what I think is another "bug": you have a method 'setAttribute' in Element that seems like it should be named either 'addAttribute' (and assume the 'replaceness') or 'includeAttribute'.  </s>
<s> I think 'add' is fine since the 'Set-like' behavior is apparent for attributes/properties.  </s>
<s> Using 'set' implies an Element has a single attribute.  </s>
<s> By the way, I assume you are proposing the DOM as a required set of interfaces instead of a conceptual set.  </s>
<s> I think it is more likely to succeed as the later (because of small but strong need variations), but I assume you are hoping for more compatibility than that.  </s>
<s> Actually, you might consider standardizing on the MONDO recipes along with the interfaces as both the conceptual and possible actual interfaces.  </s>
<s> Then if anyone deviates from the interface (in minor ways) they at least know an ObjectBuilder can build their new types of objects from the same XML source.  </s>
<s> Yet another minor comment about the Java DOM API is that the usual convention is for boolean 'getters' to be prefixed with 'is'.  </s>
<s> This could be in addition to the 'get' method or substitute for it.  </s>
<s> This is still Bean compatible in either form.  </s>

<s> I'm jumping into the conversation with very little context, but my question is simple: Shouldn't the Java DOM interfaces be completely specified by the intersection of the DOM IDL specification and the OMG IDL- Java mapping?  </s>
<s> What is there to design?  </s>
<s> Paul Presscod  </s>
<s> This is a good question, that we have wrestled with in the WG. Basically, we want to "hand code" the Java mapping because the IDL mapping is sure to be more obscure than we want, and add arguments that are relevant to CORBA RPC calls, but would be "overkill" for the DOM's primary purpose, i.e., a platform-independent API for dynamic scripting in HTML/XML browsers and editors.  </s>
<s> In short, Java is such an important target, we want to "hand-tune" the binding to be maximally understandable and useable by our target audience.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> We are using the IDL as an abstract way of specifying interfaces, not as a way of defining distributed systems.  </s>
<s> Looking at the output of Sun's  </s>
<s> idltojava, it is very complex, and most of this complexity has nothing to do with what we are actually trying to accomplish.  </s>
<s> I think the best way to see this may be to download the idltojava program from Sun and compare its output with the code we created.  </s>
<s> It is true, however, that most of this conversion can be automated, and we do use an automatic process for all of it except for the enums.  </s>
<s> I may automate that as well once we have figured out exactly what we want to do.  </s>
<s> By the way, Paul, it was great meeting you in person at SGML '97.  </s>
<s> I've seen so many of your posts, and I really like to be able to visualize the people whose posts I am reading.  </s>

<s> I'm not so interested in distributed systems as in inter-language communication, but distributed systems are a nice side effect.  </s>
<s> I've done that, and a quick browse through the files doesn't reveal to me any real extraneous stuff.  </s>
<s> Of course there are all of the distributed object support files (_*.java, *Helper.java,  </s>
<s> *Holder.java) , but you can just delete those if all you want is the interfaces, can't you?  </s>
<s> Can't you just concatenate the real interface files and call that "the Java interface"?  </s>
<s> I noticed that the enumeration is a little ugly, but Java enumerations are pretty weak.  </s>
<s> And ugly enumerations seem a small price to pay for reliable inter-language communication and distributed operability.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could just give me some examples of things that are very different between what you are developing and what idl2java produces (other than the helper/holder cruft).  </s>
<s> BTW, It was nice to meet you too.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we'll meet again somewhere where we have more time to talk.  </s>

<s> Could you indicate what's your reference document ?  </s>
<s> I use the DOM level-one-971009 and I didn't find "OccurrenceType".  </s>
<s> Thank you for your help.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> idem.  </s>
<s> I don't find classes and even less the inner classes.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Regards, Laurent ROUVET.  </s>
<s> Remember that the DOM is supposed to be useful for and intelligible to both the XML/SGML community, which is somewhat comfortable with the "Grove model", and the HTML community, which is generally unfamiliar with it (and probably would find it a bit overwhelming).  </s>
<s> We did go through the Groves property set to make sure that we weren't missing anything.  </s>
<s> So I think the DOM WG is comfortable with having an API that is inspired by, and partially consistent with the Groves model, but it is not our objective to maintain consistency with the Groves model for its own sake If you feel that there is some specific thing in the Grove model that should be in the DOM, your suggestions would be welcomed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike Champion  </s>
