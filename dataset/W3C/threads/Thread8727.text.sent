This might be somewhat forward-looking but given that the KeyInfo element will likely be re-used for the future XML Encryption spec, would it not make sense to give it its own namespace? 
We could for example, use these three namespaces: "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/signature#" for the Signature-specific elements "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/encryption#" for the Encryption-specific elements "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/keyinfo#" for the the KeyInfo element Regards, Ed I'm not sure what this buys us (besides more namespaces). 
The dsig namespace unambiguously identifies it.

XML-Signature Co-Chair http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/ Are currently people working on an XML Encryption spec? 
Regards, Christian In my opinion, this buys a clearly structured repository of references to cryptographic algorithms and structures. 
It simplifies re-use of definitions, since you know where to look if you want to include a reference to an algorithm in your self-defined XML document. 
Speaking of re-use, has there been any discussion in the past about including some sort of reference to well-known OIDs for cryptographic algorithms?

definitions, algorithm I still don't understand (please show me an example of what this provides above/beyond my example). 
If you and/or Ed are advocating a DTD module based construction [1], I would advise against that: XHTML did it because they started well before schemas. 
If you are advocating a composed schema [2] based on specific namespaces, I think that would be interesting, but a bit too advanced for my tastes at this moment. 
(And -- obviously -- I'm not sure what having a separate namespace without either of these things actually provides.) including I believe the general feeling has been to avoid OIDs (and related discussion).

XML-Signature Co-Chair http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/ Yes, it somehow does not feel right to avoid ASN.1 on the one side and introduce OID's. 
What might make sense however would be to compose some informational document containing an equivalence table between the well known OID's and the URI's.

Actually, your example is fine. 
Adding a new namespace for general crypto references is not so much a matter of simplifying a concrete specification, but can help (in my view) to make the design of additional Schemata using crypto easier, as there is a canonical place to look for previous definitions of crypto primitives. 
It could help to avoid multiple definitions of the same algorithms in several places, as happened with OIDs. 
As I have not been involved in the XML Signature definition process up to now, I am not sure if, how and when this can be realized, but I like the idea of crypto namespaces along the lines sketched by Ed Simon, where the definions might even contain informational mappings to OIDs. 
But then, this might also be Malte Malte Borcherding Technical Research Manager BROKAT Infosystems AG Voice: (+49)711-78844 231 70565 Stuttgart WWW: http://www.brokat.com
