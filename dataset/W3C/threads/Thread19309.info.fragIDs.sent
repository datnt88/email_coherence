<s> Hey, I'm trying to resize the icons in the toolbar to increase  </s>
<s> accessibility.  </s>
<s> After searching through the code, I'm inclined to think that the size is defined in either inites.c  </s>
<s> or initpses.c because it defines things like  </s>
<s> #define gray_width 16 which I thought was a size rendering of the box for a particular color set.  </s>
<s> But after doing some testing those numbers don't seem to affect the toolbar.  </s>
<s> Also, I don't think that resizing the toolbar in the resource editor (for MS VC++) does the trick because when you load up Amaya again, the icons become all off-centered.  </s>
<s> It appears as if the toolbar.bmp was layed down in that Frame and then the old sized boxes were superimposed onto them.  </s>
<s> I can put a  </s>
<s> picture of it on-line if that explanation is not sufficient...  </s>
<s> Any ideas where the size of the boxes over the toolbar is defined?  </s>
<s> Thanks, David  </s>
<s> Ramzi, thanks for the help... is it appli.c or winthotcompilers.c? either way, the size of the buttons is already defined to 32x32 according to the api listed below but the icons are all definitely sized at 16x16.  </s>
<s> I resized the icons in the resource editor, then when I go to Amaya, the icons are 32x32 but the boxes clip them because they're still 16x16.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> Do I need to rerun compilers.exe  </s>
<s> do effect changes in winthotcompilers.c?  </s>
<s> Thanks, David  </s>

<s> Hi David, The Windoz standard icons may be 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.  </s>
<s> However, it is possible to resize icon with other values.  </s>
<s> (*1*)If you want to defines your own sizes, first, you have to edit the toolbar and resize the icons: doubleclick on an icon, you will have a dialog an then you can choose other values for the width and the height of icons.  </s>
<s> in appli.c  </s>
