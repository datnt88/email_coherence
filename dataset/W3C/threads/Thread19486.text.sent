These three sites did not pass W3C validation. 
They look OK to me. 
What is wrong? 
Jim FitzSimons This one is fairly obviously broken, I don't understand why you can't see it from the validation report. 
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd" HTML ^^^^^^^^ You are pusbing your luck by leaving out head and body, although I don't understand this one. 
These are obviously mismatched and center, being block level can't precede a closing inline tag. 
^^^^^^^ You've implicitly started the body, but this is only allowed in head. 
Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind /center br /font /font title probably confuses this, but you're closing a block element so there can't be open inline elements like font. 
These have already been implicitly closed by the error recovery on /center Most of the rest is because it has been confused into thinking you are still in an implied head section.

David-- Thank you for your help. 
I fixed http://www.neta.com/~cherry/42ex.html and I added a header. 
Also it seems the validator requires LF for the end of line. 
I had CR LF for end of line. 
It contains MATHML. 
Amaya displays all the MATHML in that file except &amp;prod;. 
Does the validator understand MATHML? 
Do I have to tell the validator that the document contains MATHML?
