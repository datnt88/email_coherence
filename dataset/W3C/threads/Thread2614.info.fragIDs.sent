<s> with the availability of 413 (request too large), 411 was not made clear to me from the specification.. it's only from working with it for the last year that I've come to some clarity on the topic, and who knows if that's shared with other folks.  </s>
<s> In a previous episode Roy T. Fielding said...  </s>
<s> :: [..] Any server has the right to deny :: service rather than buffer an unknown amount of data.  </s>
<s> a server does not commit to an all or nothing buffering process.. it can buffer and if the request seems to be getting too large, it may abort with 413... requiring attempts at chunked processing never requires commitments to unknown amounts of material.  </s>
<s> Each chunk is labeled with a length and the server is free to send back 413 if the length of the upcoming chunk pushes it over a threshold of that which it is willing to buffer.  </s>
<s> However, I can see that under some circumstances like CGI a server might be unwilling to continue to buffer a chunked request at some threshold (and it must be buffered because CGI requires a content-length) but if it had come with a c-l it could be streamed to the CGI, so 411 would seem to convey the feeling.  </s>
<s> However, making that threshold 0 is ridiculous.  </s>
<s> The vast majority if CGIs take very little input.. there are exceptions of course but presumably they can be designed in an environment that can either afford the buffering or done with something other than CGI 1.1 that doesn't have the CL problem. the 411 distinction of "you must be capable of doing chunked, but you're never actually required to do it" is too fine of a line in my opinion.... but that's a retrospective, there really isn't anything that can be done about it now even if we agreed the semantics for it needed to be stronger.  </s>
<s> (and I suspect we don't agree.. que sera sera).  </s>
<s> -P  </s>

<s> Also, the fact that an implementation or product is compliant does not automatically mean that it is a good or even a fully featured implementation.  </s>
