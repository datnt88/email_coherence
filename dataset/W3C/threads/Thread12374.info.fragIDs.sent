<s> The IMS work has developed with the idea of a learner info profile (LIP) that helps with the organisation of the learning objects.  </s>
<s> One aspect of this that relates to the learner's accessibility needs is proposed to be added to the standard LIP.  </s>
<s> At the meeting we shared with the IMS Accessibility WG, back in October, we discussed this idea.  </s>
<s> There were some comments from members of the WCAG WG and later, some from members of the ATAG WG.  </s>
<s> As the document is in draft form, and not yet public, I would like to ask you, or relevant others, to let me know if you have the time and are willing to review this bit of the profile and offer comments.  </s>
<s> I will then send you the draft.  </s>
<s> (Please forward this to others who might be interested.) We would rather not have the draft made pubic yet.  </s>
<s> Liddy  </s>
