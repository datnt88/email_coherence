I can't get amaya 1.3 to print anything on Digital UNIX 4.0D. 
I tried to use the print command directly and got the following message : WARNING: cannot open file en-printdialogue I fixed it by taking the *-printdialogue files from the NT distribution but it didn't solve the problem. 
By the way, print has a lot of options which could be usefull for improving the page layout (margins, ...). 
Are they documented somewhere ? 
Can print be called directly ? 
Another light problem : the Views help page was missing from my Windows distribution.

I get the message about en-printdialogue as well on my Digital UNIX 4.0D system... 
However, it non-the-less has been printing fine, despite the error message. 
Do you have a default printer set in your /etc/printcap file (the name lp needs to be an alias for one printer)?

The $PRINTER variable was defined. 
We added an lp entry to /etc/printcap, but it didn't change anything. 
It does not generate a postscript file either. 
Any ideas about what I could look for ?

Sorry, I don't have any good idea... I'd make sure that "lpr" without arguments is printing properly; beyond that, I don't know. 
It isn't obvious what is wrong, and I've had no problems (beyond the error message we've noted) printing on Digital UNIX 4.0D. 
The Amaya folks might have other suggestions.
