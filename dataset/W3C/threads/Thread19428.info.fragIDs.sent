<s> I can't get amaya 1.3 to print anything on Digital UNIX 4.0D.  </s>
<s> I tried to use the print command directly and got the following message : WARNING: cannot open file en-printdialogue I fixed it by taking the *-printdialogue files from the NT distribution but it didn't solve the problem.  </s>
<s> By the way, print has a lot of options which could be usefull for improving the page layout (margins, ...).  </s>
<s> Are they documented somewhere ?  </s>
<s> Can print be called directly ?  </s>
<s> Another light problem : the Views help page was missing from my Windows distribution.  </s>

<s> I get the message about en-printdialogue as well on my Digital UNIX 4.0D system...  </s>
<s> However, it non-the-less has been printing fine, despite the error message.  </s>
<s> Do you have a default printer set in your /etc/printcap file (the name lp needs to be an alias for one printer)?  </s>

<s> The $PRINTER variable was defined.  </s>
<s> We added an lp entry to /etc/printcap, but it didn't change anything.  </s>
<s> It does not generate a postscript file either.  </s>
<s> Any ideas about what I could look for ?  </s>

<s> Sorry, I don't have any good idea... I'd make sure that "lpr" without arguments is printing properly; beyond that, I don't know.  </s>
<s> It isn't obvious what is wrong, and I've had no problems (beyond the error message we've noted) printing on Digital UNIX 4.0D.  </s>
<s> The Amaya folks might have other suggestions.  </s>
