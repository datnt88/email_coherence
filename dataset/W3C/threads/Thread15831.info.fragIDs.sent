<s> Yes, I like it very much.  </s>
<s> Also note that http://www.operasoftware.com is an alternate URL for it.  </s>
<s> I don't have "a handicap", but the keyboard navigation is pretty nice.  </s>
<s> I use a few keyboard shortcuts simply for the sake of speed.  </s>
<s> It's good for testing because it does HTML 3.2 pretty good, and is highly configurable -- more than either MSIE or Navigator -- allowing you to easily toggle images/colors off and on, disable or enable frames (vital for viewing "noframes" tags), and other fun stuff.  </s>
<s> It's only "missing" three major things: * Full HTML 4.0 support (hopefully coming soon) * Support of any kind for stylesheets (hopefully coming soon) * Good support for Java (which I won't miss) It does most everything else you'd want -- SSL, javascript, plugins, etc.  </s>
<s> One big selling point is the size -- it's still small enough to fit on a floppy, and yet compares favorably to Navigator and MSIE versions 3.*-something.  </s>
<s> Very fast both to start and load pages, with lots of cache-level controls makes it good for older computers.  </s>
<s> Wow, I sound like an evangelist, don't I? Drawback is that it's not simply a marketing tool for a huge corporation (as MSIE and Navigator are), but a real product supporting a staff of around 15 people or so; this means that it's not given away for free, but costs $35.  </s>

<s> I have used the Opera browser, and been very impressed with it.  </s>
<s> It does not implement Java, nor much in the way of javascript if anything, but it is nice to use and it is small in size.  </s>
<s> Opera claims that they will be implementing CSS2 in the next couple of months, which would be nice.  </s>
<s> It is not, however, free - it costs about USD$35 I think.  </s>
<s> The demo version is fully functional for a month.  </s>

<s> [snip snip snip]  </s>
<s> I have a registered copy of Opera.  </s>
<s> It seems like a decent browser.  </s>
<s> I don't use it often, though.  </s>
<s> The current version seems like no more than a MDI variation on NCSA Mosaic.  </s>
<s> I don't like the fact that it is a relatively new browser that costs $35 and doesn't support CSS.  </s>
<s> The only way to manipulate rendering is with HTML 3.2 or HTML 4 transitional markup.  </s>
<s> One more reason for people to use deprecated HTML markup.  </s>
<s> I would really like it if it was as revolutionary as 'the press' says.  </s>
<s> Give me CSS and I will follow.  </s>
<s> I don't really care if it supports Java, ActiveX, Javascript or anything.  </s>
<s> I just want it to handle not supporting them.  </s>
<s> I haven't tested its handling of objects, I just thought that I should mention it.  </s>
<s> That is my take on Opera.  </s>
<s> In general, I think that it has great potential.  </s>
