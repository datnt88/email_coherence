<s> The August WD has changed the description of StepExpr (Section 3.2.1) so that PrimaryExpr is now possible.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that a PathExpr like:  </s>
<s> A/B/3.14159 is legal?  </s>
<s> If so, what would it mean?  </s>
<s> PS: As everyone else has said, the August WD is a wonderful improvement.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> It's legal in the grammar, but it's a type error.  </s>
<s> Just like: A | B | 3.14159 which is grammatically legal, but a type error, in XPath 1.0.  </s>

<s> Michael, Thanks for the quick reply.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I chose a bad example.  </s>
<s> I still don't see the use of allowing a PrimaryExpr as a StepExpr.  </s>
<s> Since it was just added to the WD, I assume there was a good use for it.  </s>
<s> Can you show an example?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Sure, (1) document('a.xml')/id('a123')  </s>
<s> (2) book/(chapter|appendix)/section Also (3) $x/(/) though we also provide the more comfortable syntax xf:root($x) for this one... Basically, there is no good reason to treat "/" differently from any other operator.  </s>
<s> Syntactically, its operands can be any expression, and restricting the operands is done through type rules, not by using the grammar.  </s>
<s> There is one slightly unfortunate consequence, which is that it's legal to write things on the rhs of "/" that don't depend on the context node, for example (4) document('a.xml')/document('b.xml')  </s>
<s> (5) book/$param {--legal if $param is a node-sequence --} In this case, the lh operand is effectively ignored.  </s>
<s> I think there's a good case for implementations to produce warnings when such constructs are used: it's similar to the problem that occurs in XSLT 1.0 when people write xsl:sort select="$param"/ , and the most likely explanation is the same - because of the "$" sign, many beginners imagine that variables are macros.  </s>
