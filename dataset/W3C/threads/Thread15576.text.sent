I think "short sound" may mean so many things... maybe we could try and explain what we're thinking about: do we mean "impulsive sounds"? 
If so we'd better use the word "impulsive", as it is quite self-explaining.

This would apply to a passing bus. 
Which would be a short sound - but would not be impulsive.
