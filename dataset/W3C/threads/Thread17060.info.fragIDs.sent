<s> Sorry if this is OT but I've tried elsewhere and no-one can tell me the answer and I don't really want to join another W3C list for the purposes of this query.  </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me why form elements have to be enclosed in a p /p to validate as html 4.01 strict?  </s>
<s> I know that it's like that in the html spec but why?  </s>
<s> Why can't we just have all the elements in the form /form tags?  </s>
<s> At first I thought it was probably a block/inline thing but I'm not so sure now.  </s>

<s> Form can only directly contain a block element, hence you need to have a block element that can contain inline ( p , div , td etc.) in the form and the input / or whatever inside that.  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd for details.  </s>
<s> Yes, so the fields need not be included into p elements; other block elements will do, syntactically at least.  </s>
<s> The principle that inline (text level) elements need to be wrapped inside block level containers (in HTML 4 Strict) is a relatively old one.  </s>
<s> Even the HTML 2.0 specification contained a "Strict Level 1 HTML DTD", where a body element must not directly contain inline elements.  </s>
<s> What does it matter?  </s>
<s> Well, from the accessibility point of view, it is very natural to group e.g. an input field and the associated label inside a div , especially since it's normally best that they appear on a line of their own.  </s>
<s> And this automatically puts them inside a block level container.  </s>
<s> Such constructs might be _additionally_ grouped inside enclosing div or other elements, such as fieldset .  </s>
<s> I'd say that normally p is not the logical markup to use inside a form except for longish explanations (instructions).  </s>
<s> A label/field pair is not really a paragraph, and neither is a collection of such pairs.  </s>
