Hi, everyone, 
Could you please tell me whether there is some free software complying with DOM Level 2 using Java, i.e. some classs and interface package compying with DOM? 
If so, could you please tell me where I can get it? 
Thanks! 
B.Regards!

Conforms to the latest version of the spec ("CR") as best as I can tell. 
Supports quite a few of the optional modules. 
It's open source; the distribution includes source, javadoc, and some examples. 
I suggest you also grab the "utilities" package, so that you can easily hook it up to your preferred SAX parser. 
If you don't have one, it includes a variety. 
(Validating and non, a "DOM walker", SAX2 wrapper around Swing's HTML parser, and SAX2 wrappers for some other parsers.) - Dave 
See also http://xml.apache.org -- the "Xerces" parser, which is based on an improved version of IBM's XML4J package, includes a DOM that supports much of DOM Level 2. For now the new APIs are reached via a separate package name (it was com.ibm.xml.domx; 
I'm not sure what that's been changed to in this release), to avoid confusion over what is and isn't part of the official DOM spec; that distinction will go away when DOM Level 2 becomes a RECcomendation, and folks should be able to just change their imports and recompile.
