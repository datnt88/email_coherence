<s> Hi, everyone,  </s>
<s> Could you please tell me whether there is some free software complying with DOM Level 2 using Java, i.e. some classs and interface package compying with DOM?  </s>
<s> If so, could you please tell me where I can get it?  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> Conforms to the latest version of the spec ("CR") as best as I can tell.  </s>
<s> Supports quite a few of the optional modules.  </s>
<s> It's open source; the distribution includes source, javadoc, and some examples.  </s>
<s> I suggest you also grab the "utilities" package, so that you can easily hook it up to your preferred SAX parser.  </s>
<s> If you don't have one, it includes a variety.  </s>

<s> See also http://xml.apache.org -- the "Xerces" parser, which is based on an improved version of IBM's XML4J package, includes a DOM that supports much of DOM Level 2. For now the new APIs are reached via a separate package name (it was com.ibm.xml.domx;  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what that's been changed to in this release), to avoid confusion over what is and isn't part of the official DOM spec; that distinction will go away when DOM Level 2 becomes a RECcomendation, and folks should be able to just change their imports and recompile.  </s>
