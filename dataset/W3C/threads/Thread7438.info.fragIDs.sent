<s> Hi everyone This is Kojiro Wakabayashi from NTT.  </s>
<s> This is the first time to post this ML so, I will apologize in advance in case of posting unappropriate subjects.  </s>
<s> I am wondering that whether webDAV is expected to protect some image files (ex.  </s>
<s> GIF, Jpeg...) for not copying and delivering them with no allowance.  </s>
<s> Is this topic covered by webDAV ?  </s>

<s> If I understand your question correctly, I think the answer is "no".  </s>
<s> WebDAV will not be providing any form of copy protection for images or other resources on a web site.  </s>
<s> A future extension of WebDAV will be providing the  </s>
<s> ability to set and retrieve "Access Control Lists" which can restrict access to a resource, but I doubt this will be based on allowances, etc, or have copy protection provisions.  </s>
