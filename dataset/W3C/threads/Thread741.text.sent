How do I get Tidy to leave my entities alone ? 
e.g., if I have an entity in my HTML doc. 
instance that is not recognized by Tidy (not in entities.c),

try quote-ampersand: no OK, this helps to leave &amp;foo; and &amp;num; and &amp;ast; alone, but I DO also want NAKED "&amp;" to be changed to &amp;amp; (which this does not do) -- is that possible, or is it too much to expect both?

Help !

Which version of Tidy are you using ? 
Some older versions handled &amp; incorrectly.
