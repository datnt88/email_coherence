<s> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Greetings and a quick question:  </s>
<s> After I upgraded to XFree86 3.2, Amaya and Thot fail to recognise CTRL+ Key commands, producing special characters instead.  </s>
<s> Where should I look for a solution?  </s>

<s> CTRL+ Key commands are managed in the function ThotInput of the Thot library (located in Thot/thotlib/dialogue/input.c).  </s>
<s> The function InitTranslations registers key commands and the function ThotInput detects when a key command is called.  </s>
<s> The function ThotInput calls XLookupString before looking for a registered key command.  </s>
<s> You should look at if the XLookupString has been changed ?  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Well, you can first have a look at /etc/X11/XF86Config, in the Section "Keyboard" .  </s>
<s> Mine has the following :  </s>
<s> # To set the LeftAlt to Meta, RightAlt key to ModeShift, # RightCtl key to Compose, and ScrollLock key to ModeLock: # LeftAlt Meta RightAlt ModeShift # RightCtl Compose # ScrollLock ModeLock # XkbDisable XkbKeymap "xfree86(fr)" The first defines how the flags describing the Modifiers are mapped to the keys.  </s>
<s> You can also change the keymap dynamically using xmodmap command.  </s>
<s> Have a look at the Thot/config/amaya.keyboard file to check the current accelerators mapping.  </s>

<s> Mine was basically identical to yours, and I modified it further, to no avail.  </s>
<s> My amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> contains the default mappings, in the form Ctrl Key a: TtcStartOfLine() etc., plus some of my own favourites, e.g. Ctrl Key s , Ctrl Key c: CreateElemCode() which all worked before upgrading.  </s>
<s> I also upgraded my Red Hat 4.0 system to 4.1, but somehow I do not think this should have any effect, as other SW works as usual.  </s>
<s> Apart from this little annoyance, I must say that Amaya has come a long way from the alpha versions last year.  </s>
<s> I do WWW development for a living, and Amaya is now stable enough to be my primary development tool.  </s>
<s> There isn't really any competition, as most HTML publishing packages do not pay much attention to the underlying SGML DTD.  </s>
<s> As our company always aims at producing material which adheres to the current recommendations, using another editor would be a royal pain in the rear, due to the fact that after you have finished editing, you would have to fire up a text editor and use some validation tools to sort out the mess the publication software produces.  </s>
<s> With Amaya, there is no such need.  </s>
<s> Great work, Sami Sami Lempinen * ssl@sci.fi  </s>
