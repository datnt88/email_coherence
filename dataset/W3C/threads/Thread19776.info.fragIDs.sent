<s> I have not been able to get Amaya to run in Windows 95 (ver 4.0.1111).  </s>
<s> I have looked through the archive and found that someone else had the same problem on Windows NT4, this message was called 'Amaya on NT4' from Ross Smith (ross.smith@nz.eds.com) on Thu, 09 Oct 1997 10:51:38 +1200.  </s>
<s> I found no solution in the Archives, perhaps I overlooked the message.  </s>
<s> Amaya will run for a few seconds then close, the GUI never appears.  </s>
<s> Amaya was unzipped in the c:\ directory.  </s>
<s> I have a directory called C:\tmp .  </s>
<s> I have set the HOME_PAGE=http://kg9ae.dyn.ml.org/ .  </s>
<s> I have made several changes to the thot.ini with no success.  </s>
<s> Are there any environment variables that need to be set?  </s>
<s> I tried adding the thot directory, including subdirectories, to the path.  </s>
<s> My machine is a Pentium 166 MHz, 32 MB SDRAM, 72 MB swap file.  </s>
<s> I have 16MB free physical memory.  </s>

<s> Hi David, We recommand to unzip the binaries of amaya using winzip (http://www.winzip.com).  </s>
<s> The latest release of Amaya creates the directory C:\TEMP if this latter doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> Now the only problem you may have is the thot.ini  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> It should look like the following: [thot_lib] THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya DICOPAR=$(THOTDIR)\dicopar [amaya.exe]  </s>
<s> THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya LANG=en_US HOME_PAGE=http://kg9ae.dyn.ml.org Check this file and try amaya again, it should work.  </s>

<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> The c:\temp directory was the problem.  </s>
<s> Wonderful browser/editor.  </s>
<s> Keep up the great work.  </s>
