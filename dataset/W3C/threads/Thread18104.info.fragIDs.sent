<s> Hello, Marja Koivunen has pointed out to me that checkpoints 4.14 and 4.15 of the 1 September Guidelines have minor problems.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints are: 4.14 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  </s>
<s> Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 4.15 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  </s>
<s> Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight mechanism.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] The problems are: a) Neither checkpoint talks about non-visual highlighting b) Neither checkpoint includes a minimum requirement for non-visual highlighting.  </s>
<s> To address this, I propose the following changes: 1) List "voice pitch" as an example of how audio highlighting might be done.  </s>
<s> 2) Specify that the minimal requirements mentioned (fonts and colors) apply to graphical user agents.  </s>
<s> 3) Do not include minimal requirements for non-visual highlighting, but add a cross reference to checkpoint 4.12 (speech parameter control).  </s>

<s> I agree with these proposals, although it would be nice to see at least 3 examples of graphical options (At the moment I am too tired to think of any though).  </s>
