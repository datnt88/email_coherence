Hello, Marja Koivunen has pointed out to me that checkpoints 4.14 and 4.15 of the 1 September Guidelines have minor problems. 
The checkpoints are: 4.14 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts. 
Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts. 
[Priority 1] 4.15 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts. 
Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts. 
The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight mechanism. 
[Priority 1] The problems are: a) Neither checkpoint talks about non-visual highlighting b) Neither checkpoint includes a minimum requirement for non-visual highlighting. 
To address this, I propose the following changes: 1) List "voice pitch" as an example of how audio highlighting might be done. 
2) Specify that the minimal requirements mentioned (fonts and colors) apply to graphical user agents. 
3) Do not include minimal requirements for non-visual highlighting, but add a cross reference to checkpoint 4.12 (speech parameter control). 
Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). 
For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.

Addendum: the same problem/solution applies to checkpoints 8.2 and 8.3: (rendering link information).

I agree with these proposals, although it would be nice to see at least 3 examples of graphical options (At the moment I am too tired to think of any though).
