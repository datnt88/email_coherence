I am new to the http world and looking for the draft version 1.1. 
I have not been able to locate this version, and thought that I might have found it at a site, but it is not available yet. 
Specifically, I am looking at the push server capability aspects of the protocol. 
Would appreciate any help on finding http 1.1 or this new feature. 
It is not available yet. 
Since I seem to have come down with a cold imported from California, it probably won't be available until Monday. 
That feature is documented somewhere at Netscape HQ. 
I have not received any requests to include that feature in HTTP/1.1.

It's also not an HTTP issue. 
server-spewHHpush is implemented as a multipart object with a particular unregistered content type (multipart/x-mixed-replace), and since HTTP can transport any MIME object, it's no problem.
