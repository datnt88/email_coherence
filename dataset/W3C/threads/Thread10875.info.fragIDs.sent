<s> You cannot expect a paragraph to look right in all applications because an application, by definition, has the right to do whatever it want with your data.  </s>

<s> The proposal that I did defines the output of the XML parser: -1/ All CR/LF/whitespaces are restituted or transformed using Delenda Est and go as the output of the XML parser -2/In addition, the author can communicate its intend, where he think whitespaces/CR/LF are important (such in PRE elements) by writing PRE -XML-SPACE=PRESERVE PRESERVE could also be used in semantical elements corresponding for example to quotations or poem where you do not want the text to be munged for formatting purpose.  </s>

<s> We have not discussed yet, if, in the case of adopting RE Delenda, we still -in XML- delete white spaces in element-content in a validating parser.  </s>

<s> But I thought whitespace in #pcdata was implicitly preserved (eg here in paragraphs where mixed content is not in use): it's only whitespace in locations where #pcdata is NOT permitted which can be removed (eg the TABs, newlines, and spaces inserted by psgml to indent the structure while editing).  </s>
