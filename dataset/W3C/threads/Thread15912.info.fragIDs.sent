<s> Hi, I've been asked to track down a robust example of CSS for screen readers.  </s>
<s> Could someone point me to an example like this?  </s>
<s> Thanks very much,  </s>

<s> Unfortunately I do not properly understand what you are seeking.  </s>
<s> If you are referring to ACSS, then the only implementation of which I am aware is T.V. Raman's Emacspeak in cooperation with the W3 browser.  </s>
<s> The latter includes a default style sheet which specifies certain ACSS properties.  </s>
<s> To avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, I would suggest that Emacspeak and similar software, which interprets the markup together with audio style sheets, should not be referred to as a "screen reader", since its function is not to read the screen but rather to produce an audio representation of the document.  </s>
<s> It constitutes an "audio formatter" in T.V. Raman's sense of the term.  </s>
<s> Hi, I'm not looking for the ACSS, but rather a CSS which will make a web page easier for a blind person using a screen reader.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> One example is that in browsers that can ignore CSS (through either design or user option) CSS based spatial formatting can be eliminted.  </s>
<s> Visual button effects can also be created in style sheets, so people do not have to use GIF images to create the effects.  </s>
<s> A URL to an example follows: The Trace Center may also have examples, contact Wendy Chisholm.  </s>
