<s> Hi Charles, Take a look again.  </s>
<s> It is correct as written.  </s>
<s> It will always be needed for server side.  </s>
<s> But only is needed on CLIENT SIDE until the user agents render it.  </s>
<s> Then it drops off the map for client side (but stays P1 for server) Does it make sense now on re-reading?  </s>
