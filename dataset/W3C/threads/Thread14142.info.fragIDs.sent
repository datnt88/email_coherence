<s> My rationale: In addition to the rationale that the user agents don't support it today, even if they did, how does that improve accessibility?  </s>
<s> I agree it improves "international-ability" - my ability to seek a person (or machine) that can interpret the foreign phrase.  </s>
<s> For example: Home Page Reader (Japanese version) supports both Japanese and English web pages without using the LANG attribute because most pages don't use the LANG attribute.  </s>
<s> Japanese pages are usually in a different character set even though they have English text.  </s>
<s> The English text is spoken with a strong Japanese accent by the synthesizer.  </s>
<s> Home Page reader (international version currently in beta) will support English (U.K. and U.S.) Spanish, French, and German pages (not phrases mid-stream) with and without the LANG attribute.  </s>
<s> Switching software text-to-speech engines mid-stream is proving very difficult.  </s>
<s> Hearing a phrase in Japanese and/or seeing the phrase in Japanese does not help me directly if I don't understand Japanese.  </s>
<s> Helping me understand Japanese is not an "accessibility" issue, but a translation or internationalization issue.  </s>
<s> Please understand, I support the use of the LANG attribute and hope it's wider adoption will facilitate automated translation techniques - after all I work for an international company.  </s>
<s> Leaving it in the WCAG document raises this awareness, but leaving it a P1 or P2 misuses the definition and reduces credibility.  </s>

<s> If it were only a priority 3 requirement today, then it would be rarely implemented, even in multilingual documents.  </s>
<s> Then, when user agents start supporting the LANG attribute, it will not be of benefit due to the absence of this important linguistic distinction in marked up documents.  </s>
<s> Therefore, a priority 2 rating should be retained in respect of multilingual material.  </s>
<s> Also, this requirement needs to be considered in relation to the WAI user agent guidelines, which ought to recommend implementation of the LANG attribute by user agents and assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> To the contrary, it will remove significant barriers if there is more than one language being used in the document, and the document is being read via text to speech software or translated into braille, as I pointed out provided in the document, the user has no choice but to manually adjust the speech synthesizer or insert controls for the braille translator in order to generate accessible output.  </s>
<s> This would impose an onorous burden on the user.  </s>
<s> Thus, failure to supply the LANG attribute amounts to a serious barrier to accessibility, as does the failure on the part of user agents and assistive technologies to implement it.  </s>
<s> The reasoning is quite straightforward: the base language of the document can be supplied not only with the LANG attribute, but also, as I understand it, in HTTP headers; hence the LANG attribute on the HTML element is not the only available solution.  </s>
<s> Moreover, a user who is working principally in one or two languages could readily select a reasonable default and switch between the different languages when reading various web pages.  </s>
<s> The situation becomes more complex when language changes occur within the document, even inside sentences.  </s>
<s> I frequently work with such material and have had direct experience of the problems associated with producing braille copies thereof: one has to edit the markup and insert the language-related codes manually, before sending the text to a braille translator.  </s>
<s> I have already indicated that essentially the same problem arises in the case of text to speech conversion where a multilingual speech synthesizer is available.  </s>
<s> Unless the user agent can accurately ascertain the language of every word in the document, the only means of overcoming these difficulties is for the author to specify language changes explicitly in the markup.  </s>
<s> Prior discussion of this issue within the WAI context has indicated that such exacting language identification is difficult, and could in any case be better carried out by an authoring tool than by the user agent.  </s>
<s> In conclusion I would again reiterate the importance of leaving the priority status of this checkpoint unchanged.  </s>
<s> A language of a phrase is an accessibility issue since a speaking browser can't read French correctly knowing that it is iso-8859-1 and assuming that it is English.  </s>
<s> This is a difference between visual and speech medium.  </s>
<s> That is, if a user speaks both English and French and so does his speaking browser but the browser is not informed which is which, we have an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> One can claim that a browser can guess the language in all kinds of ways.  </s>
<s> But then it could also guess MIME types too.  </s>
