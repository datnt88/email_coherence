Lorrie, late but hopefully not too late: my 2 cents after re-reading the draft. 
On Element opturi (attribute of POLICY element) It currently says: Find out how to opt-out at [with link to opturi] But the opturi can also be a uri to opt-in. 
By standardizing the text above, we prevent the expression of opturi as opt-in It says: We give you access to all of our information that identifies you I'm a bit reluctant with my pigeon-english to comment here, but there might be data attached to a record of a natural person that does not identify this person but just enhances the profile. 
What about: We give you access to all of our information about you Hmm.. reading further in ACCESS, there is a mixture of "identifies you" and "information about you". 
This could be canonicalized for better understanding. it says often "[display long description and short description, if provided, with hyperlink to service URI]" shouldn't we provide a default in the absence of such a description? 
This could resolve some of the concerns of David Stampley, as we might say: If other dispute resolutions have failed, you could ultimately go to court with your case (which is always true ;) This makes more sense for law / . 
Your rights are ultimately protected by law. 
I agree with the concerns of David Stampley concerning the law / element. 
it says: "We do not keep any information that could be used to identify you personally" But in fact, this is a question of retention. 
Non-identifiable means: We do not collect any information that could be used to identify you personally The rest is okay. 
I did not find any further thing that would merit a comment. 
So I consider this already very good. 
Rigo Lorrie posted a revised matrix and has invited public comments by 13 August. 
This will allow us to make another pass at revisions by the end of August so they can be incorporated in the next browser releases. 
Nope, not too late. 
Thanks for the comments! 
Maybe we should change to "Find out how to opt-in or opt-out at" The definition of all/ is restricted to "identified data" so "about you" seems to broad? 
The service URL is always required, so maybe that should be the default The definition of this element includes both the case that the info is not collected and the case that it is collected but anonymized before being stored. 
That's why we use the term "keep" rather than "collect." 
What about opt-in/out (shorter ;) But I find the 'identifies' a bit difficult because they have that profile and now it identifies me ;). 'about you' is much more natural and semantically works well with what we want to express. 
What you mean is more of 'might be able to find out about you', which would work with 'identifiable'. 
DISPUTES What text? 
A URI has no meaning here.. 
Just say 'for disputes click here'? 
;) NON-IDENTIFIABLE In this case, non-identifiable and non-ident are semantically equal expressions in the user-interface. 
That's what I want to prevent as non-identifiable is really much stronger as non-ident in retention. 
Remember, non-ident is only about identified data and not identifiable data. 
Best, Rigo But not very meaningful. 
I agree that "about you" sounds better. 
But semantically it is wrong. 
You have it backwards. 
What I mean is information that we have identified with you (identified, not identifiable). 
NON-IDENTIFIABLE Well the semantic difference should be that non-ident is about "identified" data and non-identifiable is about "identifiable" data. 
I think the user interface expressions we are proposing make the correct distinction. 
If you want to change "keep" somewhere, arguably it would be better to change the "keep" in "nonident" to "collect" since that's the word used in the definition -- but I think its ok the way it is. 
Lorrie Ok. ACCESS all / I think we are on the same side in what we want to express :) 'Identified with you' sounds more like what I meant, but doesn't it look like too much of data protection talk if we say 'identified with you'? 
NON-IDENTIFIABLE I've re-read the sections and I think it is ok the way it is. 
But still the only distinction between 'could identify you' and identified information (we might have identifiable information) is a bit weak. 
Best, Rigo
