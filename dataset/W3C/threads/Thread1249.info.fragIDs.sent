<s> Intended usage: "This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and text processing applications and also for information interchange.  </s>
<s> The set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in typical office environments in at least the following languages: Albanian, Croatian, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Irish Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Polish, Romanian, and Slovenian.  </s>
<s> This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1." [ISO 8859-16:2001(E), p. 1] This charset is suitable for use in MIME text body parts.  </s>
<s> ISO 8859-16 was primarily designed for single-byte encoding the Romanian language.  </s>
<s> The UTF-8 charset is the preferred and in today's MIME software more widely implemented encoding suitable for Romanian.  </s>

<s> Is there an Alias for this new Character Set?  </s>
<s> I don't see a need for any aliases, but I don't object too strongly if you really want to add any for consistency with the registration of the other ISO 8859 parts.  </s>
<s> The other ISO 8859 parts have various amounts of aliases registered (mostly for no good reason I suspect), and the equivalents for ISO-8859-16 would probably be some or all of: Alias: iso-ir-226 Alias: ISO_8859-16:2001 Alias: ISO_8859-16 Alias: latin10 Alias: l10 In general, I believe that aliases are an evil thing and the fewer there are the better.  </s>
<s> Aliases should in my opinion only be used to handle inconsistent historic practice, but they should not be introduced for new charsets.  </s>
<s> The whole point of a registry is to have *single* exact unique names for objects and conventions after all.  </s>
<s> The aliases were ill conceived from the beginning.  </s>
<s> For instance: The existing ISO-IR-xxx aliases are technically wrong, because the ISO IR number refers only to the upper half (G1) of the 8-bit character set, not to the full charset.  </s>
<s> Some aliases that contain the year of publication are by now obsolete, because ISO has published the second edition of the older ISO 8859 parts.  </s>
<s> These are just some of the aspects why I think the aliases were a bad idea to start with.  </s>
<s> Also note that the capitalization in the registry is inconsistent.  </s>
<s> It says "iso-8859-14" but "ISO-8859-15".  </s>

<s> I would recommend to register a limited set of aliases for iso-8859-16.  </s>
<s> They are useful for identification, and also reference in utilities as recode etc.  </s>
<s> I share Markus aim to have as few aliases as possible, and the aliases I have asked for registration of, were only names that were in use at the time of registering.  </s>
<s> For new charsets we probably do not have that problem.  </s>
<s> Markus' set of names seems appropiate to me.  </s>

<s> I have to say that I don't care which case they are; in fact I think that leaving some in lower case and some in upper case is a good thing, because it will remind implementers that case doesn't matter for charset identifiers.  </s>

<s> Character set reviewer decision: Don't register any aliases.  </s>
<s> They were not in the form-as-submitted, can be added later using the update procedure, and we cannot get rid of aliases we have once entered.  </s>
<s> If a need for a specific alias is identified, that is the time to do it.  </s>
<s> (yes, Keld, I think it would have been better to have FAR fewer aliases in RFC 1345.  </s>
<s> But we are where we are now.) Harald  </s>
