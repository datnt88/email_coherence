<s> Not deleting the spam was an oversight on my part, I apologize.  </s>
<s> I said DNSBL ("Domain Name Service-delivered Blocking List"), not RBL ("Relay Blocking List"), it has nothing to do in particular with open relays though it doesn't exclude that either - and most of those are very much free.  </s>
<s> Osirusoft, SPEWS, ORDB, Spamhaus, SpamSites, Spambag .. there are plenty to take from and the reduction in spam is very significant (I have several accounts that would be unusable without these DNSBLs).  </s>
<s> As part of subscribing to the list, might I suggest that one is told that any emails sent to the list is automatically let through (unmoderated) - provided that the sender is not on any of the DNSBL that the list uses.  </s>
<s> Picking a set of suitable lists should be easy, and I would recommend using OsiruSoft as it combines several DNSBLs in one, allowing you to define what kind of mail you do not want on the list (mail from confirmed spam sources, mail from open relays, etc.): OsiruSoft would have prevented this spam from ever entering the list, if W3 had checked it before sending it further: Merely checking the From address is insufficient.  </s>
<s> Might I recommend reading spamfree if the administrators choose to use one or more DNSBL.  </s>
<s> Yet you only compound the problem by not deleting the non work friendly material from your reply?  </s>
<s> The issues with moderation are already addressed slightly in the respect that you have to subscribe to the list to be able to post to the list.  </s>
<s> - all you need to do is hijack an exisiting members email address (which is insanely easy), and you too can post to it.  </s>
<s> The RBL lists would only stop relay of messages, not unsolicited content.  </s>
<s> Most of the RBLs are now paid for services, although a few free providers remain, but I've noticed personally a lot of spam coming from non RBL'd sources, particularly from chinanet (the ISP, not the whole country).  </s>
<s> Technically, they don't allow relay, so they wouldn't end up in an RBL, but that won't stop their users sending huge amounts of unsolicted commercial email, will it?  </s>

<s> Sorry about that.  </s>
<s> The mailing is already moderated but obviously we have a problem somewhere.  </s>
<s> An unknown email address, including from @w3.org, should not be able to go through.  </s>
<s> I asked our system team to have a look at it and see what's wrong with our system.  </s>
<s> This might be related to our changes on the server a few months ago.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, they'll be able to find a solution asap.  </s>
