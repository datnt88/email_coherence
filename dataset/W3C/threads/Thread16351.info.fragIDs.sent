<s> the validator is linked from the page, and is the one with the w3c logo (sgml i think).  </s>
<s> jay@peepo.com  </s>
<s> The W3C validator uses James Clark's SGML parser, which can be downloaded from http://www.jclark.com/  </s>
<s> I have installed it on my GNU/Linux system and can thus validate HTML documents (or any SGML/XML document for which I have the DTD) wheneer the desire arises.  </s>
<s> The source code of the W3C validator can also be downloaded for installation on a local web server.  </s>
