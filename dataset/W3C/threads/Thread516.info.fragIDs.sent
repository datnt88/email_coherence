<s> Greetings.  </s>
<s> I am considering using jtidy as part of a tool I am creating to generate static pages.  </s>
<s> Part of my tool requires the addition of tags such as staticpage within the html documents.  </s>
<s> Now jtidy obviously complains about this since staticpage is not a valid html.  </s>
<s> I began to look at your source code and manage to have it ignore any unknown tag under the body scope.  </s>
<s> I still am looking a way for jtidy to automatically generate the /staticpage so the document becomes automatically xml compliant.  </s>
<s> Ok, my question.  </s>
<s> Would you accept the addition of an option within jtidy which would cause it to ignore additional tags and just process them to become xml compliant?  </s>
<s> Off course, this option would be off by default to keep jtidy backward compatible (and it makes sense to have this option off for most usages).  </s>
<s> But this feature might be very interesting for other projects simillar to mine where they would want their tags remain unprocessed (except for making them xml compliant).  </s>
<s> I am asking because the code change will require many changes within a few files.  </s>
<s> Thus, its not a simple patch.  </s>
<s> I cannot therefore fork my own jtidy, watch you guys fixing the main tree and adding features and then manually add my feature to each of your new releases.  </s>
<s> This is why I would like my changes to be brought into the main tree.  </s>
<s> And if you have any suggestion on how to implement it, be my guess.  </s>
<s> Since this is OO, reverse engineering it to understand what is going in is a bit difficult, and my solution might not be the most elegant/optimize.  </s>
<s> BTW, jtidy is great.  </s>
<s> I'm glad I have discovered it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the product.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Hans Deragon  </s>
<s> Hans, why do you feel you need to introduce an addition tag?  </s>
<s> The reason I'm asking is that often implementation problems can be removed by walk further up the tree to the design, or even up to the analysis and revisiting your final outcome and what assumptions you are making about why you need to go down a particular implementation path.  </s>
<s> What value would these new tags have to what you are trying to do?  </s>
<s> When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything around you looks like a nail.  </s>
<s> Start by building better tools!  </s>

<s> I want to build a template driven system for processing html files.  </s>
<s> New tags are placeholders and instructions for how to manipulate the html files.  </s>
<s> And I want these tags to be in xml format.  </s>
<s> I then pass the html files through jtidy to make them xml compliant.  </s>
<s> Then, using DOM functionnality, I can manipulate easily the different html and resolve their dependencies.  </s>
<s> I then create a new XML structure resulting from the merging of many files, and use this structure to generate the final static page (I might pass this final static page again through jtidy).  </s>
<s> Its not the most efficient way of doing, but I am not seeking most efficiency CPU or memory wise.  </s>
<s> I am seeking for the most efficient use of existing code, keeping maintenance easy, etc... Using jtidy, I have no parsing to do!  </s>
<s> It provides me the DOM document of my HTML pages (hopefully with my tags intact).  </s>
<s> Then I only have to play with the Nodes, replacing them, deleting them, etc.. to get the final structure.  </s>
<s> Ciao Hans Deragon  </s>
<s> FWIW: I haven't necessarily done the above but we do add some tags to HTML  </s>
<s> files that give us some additional information about the files.  </s>
<s> We do this  </s>
<s> by adding div and span tags with very specific attributes so that these  </s>
<s> div and span tags are not confused with existing tags.  </s>
<s> This means we do  </s>
<s> not have to have any new tags that tidy does not support.  </s>
<s> Here is a short  </s>
<s> example:  </s>
<s> Then when we are using the DOM/XSLT, we just select these elements with:  </s>
<s> //div[@title='myConfigInfo]/span[@title="color"]  </s>
<s> Just thought this might help make your job a bit easier by not having to  </s>
<s> modify how tidy works.  </s>
<s> Mmm... I do not understand where you are going at.  </s>
<s> If you pass your div and span to jtidy, jtidy will complain.  </s>
<s> So you are  </s>
<s> It shouldn't complain since div and span tags are part of the XHTML strict specification.  </s>
<s> BTW, we are using the normal tidy application and not jtidy.  </s>
<s> suggesting that I do what within my html files?  </s>
<s> Before running our html files through tidy, we add these tags to the top of the file.  </s>
<s> Since they are outside of the HTML BODY elements, tidy moves them inside those elements and make the rest of the html XML conformant.  </s>
<s> Now you have a valid XHTML file that you can access with the DOM.  </s>
<s> In your case, since you are using templates, you could place div / span tags in various locations throughout your html template and have your code use the DOM to replace those tags with the values you desire.  </s>

<s> I do not know JTidy at all, but the C version contains an option to add "new" tags.  </s>
<s> The following is from Dave's original documentation: You can teach Tidy about new tags by declaring them in the configuration file, the syntax is: new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 The same tag can be defined as empty and as inline or as empty and as block.  </s>
<s> These declarations can be combined to define an a new empty inline or empty block element, but you are not advised to declare tags as being both inline and block!  </s>
<s> Note that the new tags can only appear where Tidy expects inline or block-level tags respectively.  </s>
<s> This means you can't (yet) place new tags within the document head or other contexts with restricted content models.  </s>
<s> So far the most popular use of this feature is to allow Tidy to be applied to Cold Fusion files.  </s>
<s> I would hope a similar options would be available in JTidy.  </s>
<s> Note that this does not deal with arbitrary unknown tags, but should work if you have a defined set of new, non-html-compliant tags.  </s>
<s> Bingo!  </s>
<s> You gave me a major clue.  </s>
<s> I have added a new tag type: new-ignored-tags and it works, at least in a body tag (I will generalize it later).  </s>
<s> None of the current tag definition did what I wanted.  </s>
<s> So, developers (maintainers of Jtidy, tidy, etc..), what do you think about adding this feature in the main tree?  </s>
<s> Please provide me your comments.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Hans Deragon P.S. Jtidy is not distributed with the documentation mentionned by Lee Passey.  </s>
<s> May I suggest that it be with the next version?  </s>
<s> My humble opinion is that Jtidy should just make unknown tags well formed, as long as they have a namespace prefix associated with a namespace declaration in a correct context within the document.  </s>
<s> Another subject I am up against at this time is dealing with (X)HTML fragments (see my fragments post).  </s>
