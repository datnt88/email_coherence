<s> I think we need to pay some attention to this.  </s>
<s> This request reflects an energetic exchange of views within Webont, and although it did not emerge as a consensual group comment, it clearly reflects a very deep issue for some potentially large user communities for RDF.  </s>
<s> The issue is that the only available syntactic form for adding comments to RDF involves making RDF assertions, since rdf:comment is a genuine RDF property, so all such triples have genuine entailments.  </s>
<s> This means, in particular, that changing a comment in an ontology  </s>
<s> changes the formal entailments made by that ontology, so is a genuine logical change to that ontology.  </s>
<s> Whether or not this should be considered a bug or a feature is controversial, but there is no doubt that to those for whom it is a problem, it is a very serious and basic problem, something very close to a fatal can't-live-with  </s>
<s> objection to RDF.  </s>
<s> It also means that one can set up inference chains which are probably not what any rational person would want to do, eg by defining an rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:comment and then expecting to be able to use  </s>
<s> that to infer that something is an rdf:comment value.  </s>
<s> This distinction isn't particularly important (IMO) in RDF itself, but it becomes more trenchant in OWL, where quite subtle and indirect chains of reasoning could, in principle, allow one to draw unexpected (and probably unintended) conclusions about an rdf:comment value, eg by  </s>
<s> virtue of there only being three comments in the graph, a cardinality  </s>
<s> constraint applying to a superproperty of rdf:comment and an assertion that rdf:comment was functional could produce an inconsistency, or maybe allow one to conclude that an invisible comment must exist even though it is not in the graph.  </s>
<s> (The ambiguity in what this would really mean illustrates one of the aspects which I think most bothers Ian and others, which is that this treatment of rdf:comment muddles the distinction between the logical content of an RDF graph and what might be called the syntactic decorations of it, and hence muddies the semantic clarity of the language by importing things - in the case, comment values - into the semantic domain which do not belong there.  </s>
<s> Personally I am happier in muddier semantic waters than Ian is, but I recognize that his views are widely shared.)  </s>
<s> We could address this in various ways (dark triples, anyone?), but all but one of them are too ambitious at this stage, probably.  </s>
<s> One thing we could do relatively easily is for the MT to declare that all interpretations make all assertions of rdf:comment true.  </s>
<s> This in effect would cancel the entailments which bother Ian.  </s>
<s> What this amounts to in practice is that all comments are trivially entailed, so one cannot use entailment as a guide to associating a comment with a graph; one has to appeal to a more directly syntactic criterion,  </s>
<s> such as actually being in the graph.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, this might bother some other users who would prefer to use entailment as a general RDF 'glue', even for such things as comments.  </s>
<s> An alternative point of view is that problems will only arise if people fiddle with the machinery (which is forbidden in OWL-DL in any case), and that Ian's worries about development of large ontologies can probably be handled by providing some extra-RDF way of associating developer comments with RDF graphs, eg by adding non-RDF XML markup.  </s>
<s> This is rather a brush-off attitude, however, particularly if we do not actually provide any hints as to how this might be done.  </s>

<s> I agree we need to pay some attention to this (I remember thinking that when Ian first made the comment), but I need some clarification of the pros and cons.  </s>
<s> In Ian's message, he said "In particular, it would be inappropriate for *applications* to infer semantic differences in information represented  </s>
<s> in two ontologies based solely on differences in comments (in the same way that it would be inappropriate for code to behave differently when only the comments are changed)."  </s>
<s> [my emphasis] I'm having problems with who is doing the inferring/entailments in question, and what kinds they are.  </s>
<s> It makes perfect sense for an *application* to decide that it wants to pay no attention to triples with rdf:comment properties, but it seems to me what we're being asked to do is to rule that out in some sense for *all* applications, by making this somehow basic in RDF.  </s>
<s> If triples with rdf:comment properties are "pure comments", presumably they are still there in the  </s>
<s> graph [otherwise the XML comment option would have worked], but they are  </s>
<s> ignored in certain types of processing.  </s>
<s> I would hope that I could still write an application that, say, used the number of comments (and maybe even the length of the values) to decide whether an ontology was "well-commented" in some sense?  </s>
<s> So could you give me some test cases describing the sorts of entailments in RDF that you'd like to forbid (test cases describing the situations below, which I didn't entirely understand, would be fine).  </s>
<s> This seems similar to the class/instance distinction, which RDF also "muddles", because at this level we don't want to wire those distinctions in.  </s>
<s> That sounds reasonable, assuming I understood what these extra entailments are that create the problem (see the "test cases" comment above).  </s>
