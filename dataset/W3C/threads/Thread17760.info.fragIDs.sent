<s> I am hoping that Scott (I'm picking on you because you seem to be the biggest proponent at the moment) can give a more concise definition, or that we can start talking about smaller pieces of the process.  </s>

<s> I suspect (and hope) that it is a fairly trivial extension of the approach to test for attributes, in the same way as CSS2 requires What I am thinking is that this approach can be applied to the very simplistic sort of table navigation (cell by cell or row by row, without context) that I discussed earlier.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Charles said:  </s>
<s> In the editor application of the core code, linearisation is supported in writing out an HTML text.  </s>
<s> Somewhere among those myriad programmers, somebody already has the code to do this.  </s>
<s> Is it really that hard to anaesthetize the table rendering and follow the linear flow and still drive text to the screen?  </s>
<s> Raman was quite dismissive about what Lynx does.  </s>
<s> "Lynx doesn't do anything to linearize tables; what it produces is just a product of what it _doesn't_ do!"  </s>
<s> And this seems to work.  </s>
<s> Saying this should be done by post-processing in a script is questionable if what needs to be done can be done simply by eliminating steps in the prior processing.  </s>
<s> It sounds like you are saying that the DOM is just for show, for third-party consumption; the rendering engine doesn't use it.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it should be simple enough to down-class tables in a shim between the DOM and the existing rendering process.  </s>
