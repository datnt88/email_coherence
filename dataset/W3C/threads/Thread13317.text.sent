Working with Neal Ewers on some websites, I am reminded that there is a very simple evaluation method that is an effective test of how convenient a site is for most blind visitors. 
This is "close your eyes and listen to what you hear as you tab through the links on the page." 
How cheaply can a conscientious web author get enough speech technology to do that? 
How hard would it be to put together a couple of plugins that would make this test audible?

For a quick introduction to what kinds of devices exist, you could consult the technology glossary at the following site: Linkname: ATRC Home Page URL: http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/index.html 
Linkname: Technical Glossary URL: http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/tech/techgloss.html On the other hand, this may not really be what you need. 
This technology is not free, nor is it always easy to set up. 
There are things you can do with various websites and mainline tools which are useful for checking out your site. 
But not all these things are under one roof, so to speak. 
The WAI Evaluation and Repair Interest Group has been set up for people like you to compare notes on what works for you. 
Your post is as good a match to "an interest in evaluation and repair" as I can imagine, as meant in the charter of this group. 
Under the ER home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ you will find a list of existing tools and services. 
We need people like you to try them out and post your reactions to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org. 
The Evaluation and Repair Working Group exists to point toolsmiths at the holes that are not covered by existing capabilities. 
But the toolsmiths need to hear from their customers, like you, as to what works and doesn't work in the current offerings.

Precedence: list Hi, I am building a web site &amp; attempting to incorporate the Web Accessibility guidelines as much as possible. 
Are there software, Netscape Navigator &amp; Internet Explorer plug-in's, hardware devices, etc. that I should be aware of, using, and building to their standards? 
As best as I can tell, guidelines exist, but plug-in's, etc. for Screen Reading &amp; Audio Browsing do not exist. 
Would someone be kind enough to give me/point me to baseline material that defines the state of Web Accessibility tools? 
Do Screen Readers &amp; Audio Browsers exist? 
Do "plug-ins" exist for standard browsers that can perform these functions? 
I noticed the afternoon meeting coming up on 9/23 in Boston, and thought that attending that meeting might be a good source of information. 
Thanks for you help. 
Jeff Below is the original question I sent to Ian &amp; Daniel before becoming aware of this group. 
I've reformed my question based on looking thru the w3c-wai-ig questions, but thought I'd include the original question in the event that it provides more clarification. 
You should send this query message to w3c-wai-ig, not just to Ian and I. I personally don't know much about NS and IE plug-in, I know that there are some web proxy that can show you what a Lynx user would see. 
I don't think a Screen Reader plug-in makes sense actually, since by definition, a Screen Reader is an external agent that reads the whole screen. 
For audio browsing plug-in, I'm not sure the plug-in API allows one to completely take care of the presentation, I think that plug-in are just for OBJECT/APPLET element. 
Hi Ian &amp; Daniel, I'm trying to build a web site which incorporates the Web Accessibility guidelines as much as possible. 
Do browser plugins exist which allow Netscape Navigator &amp; IE to perform functions like Screen Reading &amp; Audio Browsing? 
Thanks, Jeff ----- End of forwarded message from Al Gilman ----- I assume this is mostly for sighted people wanting to check their page. 
So how about a simple cgi (hosted somewhere well known) that just returns the list of links on the page with text/alt and url. 
Example: would return: W3C Home http://www.w3.org WAI Home http://www.w3.org/WAI new Working Draft: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH News, Events &amp; History: #News Stay Informed, Get Involved: #Information Resources on Web Accessibility: #Resources etc. 
This could also be provide as a standalone tool. 
Note that this kind of service is already supported as part of the ETH Proxy service at http://www.inf.ethz.ch/department/IS/ea/blinds/ 
(currently down but I remember it listing all the link up front) and could easily be added to Kynn Bartlett's to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: ... This list is a good simple test for "does the link text make the results of following the link predictable?" 
On the other hand, I don't think it really measures up to the job of communicating "sippin' cyber through a straw" such as the blind experience it. 
If the CGI would feed the links to you one at a time, that might do it. 
Here is another, slightly more complicated version that I don't yet know a cheap way to do [but it could be done with styles and a little hacking...]. 
Link text of the current link is bold. 
The tab order is in textual order according to the appearance of clickables on the page. 
All other text is obscured with ROT13 transform, except for the link text that has already been passed over and that is greyed out. 
Then, to evaluate this experimentally, this takes: A good computer game designer with no background in adaptive technology as the "how comparable is this" evaluator. 
A trained speech-web-naut to demonstrate their experience and methods. 
Demonstrate both. 
Ask the game designer to compare/contrast the two.
