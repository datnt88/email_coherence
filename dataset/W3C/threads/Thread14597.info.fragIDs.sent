<s> Hi everyone, I was given several action items at the Boston face-to- face.  </s>
<s> Some I was pleased with, others are the start of what will need some discussion and other thoughts.  </s>
<s> This is one of them: Checkpoint 2.1.  </s>
<s> I'm not overly pleased with this so far, but I think it identifies a few points that could be useful.  </s>
<s> Note: I consider "navigation" to be a specific case of "interactions" and thus it may not be necessary to separate the two -- except if it's necessary for clarity's sake.  </s>
<s> Action Item: Rewrite 2.1, possibly splitting into two guidelines 2.1 Provide a variety of navigation mechanisms glossary Navigation mechanisms /glossary help the user find information on your site.  </s>
<s> Providing more than one navigation mechanism makes content easier to locate and use.  </s>
<s> ISSUE: What does "a variety" mean?  </s>
<s> By this guideline  </s>
<s> I mean "use a site map, use a search feature, use navigation  </s>
<s> bars" etc.  </s>
<s> 3.X Provide consistent interaction behaviors (should follow WD-WCAG20-20010125 guideline 3.1) glossary Interaction behaviors /glossary are the results of user actions.  </s>
<s> They include, for example: * events caused by the user activating a link * rollover effects and popup menus * form submission, after activating a submit button * interface controls within applets or scripts These actions should be predictable and sensible to the end user; this is achieved by making the interactions consistent, both within the site and with commonly used models of computer interaction.  </s>
<s> ISSUE: Should there be a separate checkpoint for navigation consistency?  </s>
<s> If so, how do we define navigation consistency?  </s>

<s> Kynn, Comments in line ...  </s>
<s> It's important to consider the size of the site to be navigated.  </s>
<s> At what size does the author need to add a site map?  </s>
<s> a navigation bar?  </s>
<s> A search feature?  </s>

<s> Another good issue.  </s>
<s> Probably a "techniques" issue but I don't mean with that suggestion that we put off the discussion of this! Techniques or checkpoint/guideline, we definitely need to arrive at a decision on this.  </s>
<s> A good source of info on this is the O'Reilly book "Information Architecture for the World Wide Web", which I've used in a textbook in my online course on Web Management.  </s>

<s> Kynn,  </s>
<s> This is your attempt to create a checkpoint that encompasses 2.5, right?  </s>
<s> [2.5 If search functions are provided, provide a variety of search options for different skill levels and preferences.]  </s>
<s> In that case then you might want to say, "provide more than one path or mechanism to find content."  </s>
<s> still pretty rough, but "more than one" might be a bit tighter than "a variety." then we could talk about the "scent of information" and the variety of ways people navigate information.  </s>
<s> It's like saying, "there are 5 paths to get from A to B and people will choose a path based on which stores they wish to pass or which park they want to walk through."  </s>
<s> this is good.  </s>
<s> At the face to face we talked about "consistent" having two meanings in this context: 1. consistency with standard UI design.  </s>
<s> 2. consistent usage within a site.  </s>
<s> This ought to mentioned in the rationale as well, no?  </s>
<s> I think navigation is a subset of navigation and therefore a separate checkpoints is not necessary.  </s>

<s> This is a question of how much abstraction we can get the reader to follow.  </s>
<s> When we talk about consistency of interaction, people will think of things like key bindings and icon to action bindings.  </s>
<s> Reasonably local stuff.  </s>
<s> And reasonably explicit.  </s>
<s> Navigation, they think of the structural patterns used to put the content together.  </s>
<s> The structure that one navigates is relatively implicit, and far-reaching.  </s>
<s> People don't think of navigation as their interacting with the document.  </s>
<s> The illusion is that there is a scroll of paper behind that scroll window and the scroll with the text on it doesn't change, one just scrolls it past the viewport.  </s>
<s> One is clearly interacting with the state of one's view of the content when one navigates.  </s>
<s> Forms and next/previous buttons and the like people are more likely to conceptualize as interaction.  </s>
<s> So I would be careful about merging the discussion of these two.  </s>
<s> Funny, we just had the same question come up in the User Agent Guidelines Al  </s>
