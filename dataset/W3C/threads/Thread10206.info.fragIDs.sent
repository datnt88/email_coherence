<s> WG (especially other editors)-- I'm probably not the only Editor who's trying to keep track of all these last minute "little suggestions" floating around that potentially affect their spec, and I'd sure appreciate it if you could be very explicit as to any changes that are actually being made.  </s>

<s> Frank makes a good point here.  </s>
<s> I'm only just beginning to appreciate how tricky it must be to keep the docs in sync.  </s>
<s> I was looking at Dave's syntax document yesterday and noticed that he has some pretty precise references to internal sections of the concepts doc (e.g. 2.4.4 ...) I guess we need a policy on how to handle these.  </s>
<s> This is really up to the editors though I have a suggestion.  </s>
<s> We could aim to have a reference freeze about a week before final review and publication.  </s>
<s> In that week the editors are not allowed to change section numbers, etc.  </s>
<s> Each editor must go through his doc in that week and check that all references are correct.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I have no objection.  </s>
<s> I think it may be tricky to completely excise all instances of "data model" from the text, as there may be places where "abstract syntax" doesn't fully connect with the readership.  </s>
<s> I've recorded this as a document issue [1], but noting Frank's concern will not act upon it until the WG is ready to coordinate any such changes.  </s>

<s> I am not doing anything to the doc this week.  </s>
<s> I was waiting to see what was said in the telecon (which I won't be attending ...) I think given the scale of comments we've already seen on both docs we are reviewing this week we need to decide how much change we want before publication.  </s>
<s> I no longer believe that this round of WD will be consistent in their cross-referencing.  </s>
<s> Overall I hope the WG can direct the editors as to the desired changes, and the editors make a good faith attempt to meet the easier ones in the timescale, and we just accept a certain amount of screw up as inevitable.  </s>
<s> I fear that all our docs may need considerable work before last call; and getting on with it seems good - even if it looks a mess from the outside.  </s>
<s> Possibly we could stagger publication.  </s>
<s> e.g. concepts goes out first, with refs to previous drafts of everything, then syntax, with refs to new concepts and previous everything else, etc.  </s>
<s> I don't think its worth the effort.  </s>
<s> I prefer a status fo this document that says that our goal on this round was to present all the technical material, and we are aware that there are editorial inconsistencies both internal to each doc and cross-document.  </s>

<s> The Primer calls RDF a "data model" in several places.  </s>
<s> Do you want me to change it?  </s>
<s> If so, can you point me to a short description of what an  </s>
<s> "abstract syntax" is?  </s>
<s> Not that I'm particularly willing.  </s>
<s> I think I know what a data model is, and I think RDF can be reasonably characterized as one: think of the relational data model, restricted to 3-ary relations, integrity constraints that keep literals from being subjects and predicates, and the inference rules defined in the Model Theory instead of an algebraic definition of operators like "join" (or Ted Codd's RM/T model, using binary relations for the properties, unary relations for classes, and a different set of constraints).  </s>
<s> I was going to cover this in a separate section of the Primer, but don't have the time now.  </s>

<s> I think that is a judgement call for you Frank.  </s>
<s> In trying to get some consistency of presentation I'm heading towards RDF is a language with one abstract syntax and several concrete syntaxes as being the 'formal' model of what we think RDF is.  </s>
<s> I know not everyone is comfortable with that, but we need to pick one.  </s>
<s> However, as Graham has pointed out, when explaining things to folks, the term 'data model' might well be more appropriate so, if in context you think data model is a better term, then there is no blanket - "you are not allowed to use that term" injunction.  </s>
<s> Jeremy's text, something along the lines of RDF's Abstract Syntax, sometimes called the RDF Data Model, ... seemed to me to set the right sort of tone.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Sounds like a fine resolution to me.  </s>
