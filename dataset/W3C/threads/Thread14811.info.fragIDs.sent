Hi Lisa, According to the minutes from June 6th (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html), there were no objections to moving forward with publication on this checkpoint. 
As indicated in the reviewer's note at the end of checkpoint 4.1 in the new draft, there is an outstanding action item for Gregg and I to compile a list of ideas related to 4.1. 
This list will serve as a basis for future discussion related to evolving this checkpoint.

sorry if I am being thick. 
I quoted the wrong meeting, - i meant HYPERLINK "http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html"http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2 002/06/06-minutes.html but i see on the minutes there: GV The 4.1 checkpoint be a rendition of "write as clearly and simply as [appropriate | possible] for content." 
Not talk about audience. 
Then no success criteria levels. 
provide a partial list of ideas and a note about it being under development. 
JS Maybe be a bit further and say that the list will be broken out into different conformance levels. 
Give some indication of what might happen to them. 
then there is consensus taking. 
followed by a slight change in wording to: "write as simply as [appropriate | possible] for the purpose of the content."

Hi Lisa, I took a closer look at this when I got in this morning and you're absolutely right. 
I've updated the draft to include the [appropriate | possible] language and revised the Reviewers note at the end of the checkpoint to reflect the fact that this checkpoint is still incomplete. 
Thanks for catching this, -Ben Behalf Of Lisa Seeman sorry if I am being thick.

Hi Lisa, According to the minutes from June 6th (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html), there were no objections to moving forward with publication on this checkpoint. 
CMN I had been under the impression that consensus wasdetermined on the list, based on decisions of meetings. 
I admit that I have not been an active member of the group recently, but could someone please clarify if this is the case? 
(Not that it has any material effect here, just that it seems unclear). 
As indicated in the reviewer's note at the end of checkpoint 4.1 in the new draft, there is an outstanding action item for Gregg and I to compile a list of ideas related to 4.1. 
This list will serve as a basis for future discussion related to evolving this checkpoint. 
I would suggest as a basis the well compiled information recently posted to the list on this topic under the title "all together" by Lisa: cheers Chaals
