<s> Perhaps this is something we could do off-list, since familiarity with RDF was supposed to be a pre-requisite for joining the WG: Working Group members will need to be familiar with the RDF Model and Syntax Specification, RDF Schema 1.0 Specification, and other related XML specifications (particularly XML Schema), and will ideally have implementation experience with RDF-based applications.  </s>
<s> I don't think our valuable group time should be spent on this.  </s>

<s> This was my idea.  </s>
<s> We do indeed expect WG members to be familiar with a vast and ever growing range of technologies.  </s>
<s> As chairs we're nevertheless aware that WG members have had varied histories; some have spent many happy hours wrestling with RDF APIs, parsers etc., others have found equally rewarding ways of spending their time.  </s>
<s> We wanted to take a few minutes on the teleconference to offer some (non telecon) time to any WG members who felt they needed some hands-on experience with current RDF tools.  </s>
<s> My suspicion was that such an exercise could also give us fodder for 'RDF hands-on howto' FAQ entries or similar.  </s>
<s> There was no intention to spend more than a few words on this during the call.  </s>
<s> Since you raise this now, let's try to do this by email with a brief follow-on tommorrow.  </s>
<s> If there are any WG members who feel their work on this group would be enhanced by more RDF hands-on experience, I hereby offer to spend a little time with them (in logged IRC) going through some of the existing RDF tools that are out there.  </s>
<s> I'd hope they would also help turn our experiments into a document that would help others going through the same learning curve.  </s>
<s> That's it really.  </s>
<s> Note that we also expect WG members to be familiar with XML Schema.  </s>
<s> I for one have to admit to not feeling fully up to speed with various aspects of the XML Schema specification.  </s>
<s> That's life; our job is  </s>
<s> to work around it!  </s>
<s> If anyone would like to spend some time looking at XML Schema tools / implementations with me I'd be very interested...  </s>
<s> We can't all read everything, but we can hopefully learn something through sharing what we do know.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> For some aspects, me too.  </s>
<s> But I found that I was able to use the Primer to learn how to build schemas, much like I learned XSLT from the spec...  </s>
<s> I might have already sent this info to the WG, but I don't clearly recall...  </s>
<s> I built some XML Schemas for subsets of RDF the other day; they might make a good intro to XML Schemas: There you'll find rdf0.rdf -- the simplest (as far as I know) document that conforms to the RDF spec.  </s>
<s> rdf0.xsd -- a simple XML Schema that rdf0.xsd is valid against.  </s>
<s> rdf0e.rdf -- a document that does *not* conform to rdf0.xsd, nor to the RDF spec.  </s>
<s> rdf1.rdf -- the next simples RDF document; one statement, no use of literals, sequences, or anything else with issues around it.  </s>
<s> rdf1.xsd -- an XML schema that rdf1.rdf validates against; it's perhaps not the simplest; it uses structures from a more complete schema for RDF.  </s>
<s> These things can be run thru the online XML Schema validator; there are links at the bottom that show how.  </s>
<s> The idea was to expand the schema (and the example documents) step-wise, to eventually visit each syntactic issue in the language.  </s>
<s> Along the way, we might discover some useful subsets of RDF syntax, ala megginson's stuff.  </s>
<s> (This relates to the attribute grammar that somebody built from XSLT; I keep meaning to find that thing again...)  </s>
<s> I'd appreciate it if anybody who *doesn't* know XML schema would take a look at this stuff and tell me if you're able to make sense of it.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> The first example (RDF0) seems straightforward.  </s>
<s> The second (RDF1), I think I see the pattern but am not completely sure: Seems to introduce a type, defined below, for element name "typedNode".  </s>
<s> Being abstract, it can't be used directly, but forms a template for instantiations that can: substitutionGroup="rdf:typedNode"/ Thus, by this schema, only Description elements can appear in RDF ?  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> Yes, you've got it.  </s>
<s> If you want to be able to use other elements in RDF , you have to declare them similarly.  </s>
<s> If you follow the link to the Aug 2000 materials, you'll find a considerably more complete XML Schema for RDF (though it's based on an outdated version of XML Schema): !-- so much for syntax structure.  </s>
<s> Now for the particular properties and classes... -- type="rdf:typedNodeType" equivClass="rdf:typedNode" / type="rdf:typedNodeType" equivClass="rdf:typedNode" / So yes, if you want to check your RDF document using XML Schema technology, you have to have declarations for all the classes, properties, etc. that you want to use.  </s>
<s> We need one for dublin core, one for DAML, etc. etc.; the good news is (a) they're easy to make; we might even be able to automate the translation from RDF schema to XML Schema (and/or the other way around) and (b) the benefit of providing an XML Schema is that it helps you find typos; e.g. if you write dc:author in stead of dc:creator, there's nothing wrong with that from an RDF schema perspective, but checking it with XML Schema technology flags it as an undeclared element.  </s>
<s> Actually, I suppose there are ways to use RDF schema to find such typos; TimBL has been hacking in that direction.  </s>
<s> And there are ways to describe RDF syntax with a less constraining XML Schema that would allow more stuff to go undeclared, but wouldn't find errors.  </s>
<s> This is just one approach.  </s>
