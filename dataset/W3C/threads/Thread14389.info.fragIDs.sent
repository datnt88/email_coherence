<s> Please accept my apologies if I offend the authors.  </s>
<s> There is much that is great, but it is very well hidden.  </s>
<s> I really hope I found the right page folks.  </s>
<s> I personally find the page http://www.w3.org/WAI/ very poorly designed.  </s>
<s> Jonathan, I will agree with you that it is not well designed, but I am not certain that I would consider all of these problems to be -accessibility- issues as much as -usability- issues.  </s>
<s> In other words, I think the problems are of a different type than access to the disabled; I feel that in many ways the problems are simply with being usable by -anyone-, disability or not.  </s>
<s> Keep the language simple, and I will endeavour to source the symbols once we have agreed the text.  </s>
<s> If we limited ourselves to a flick book style with no cross links, we could for this first draft possibly skip navigation, perhaps limiting ourselves to a site identifier.  </s>
<s> Okay, my problem here is that many people, myself included, use the WAI home page as a starting point to locate resources.  </s>
<s> I don't want to have a straight linear "flip book" style for navigating through the site, as I feel that will decrease overall usability.  </s>
<s> A flip book -can- exist but if it is the only means of access to the site, then there's a problem.  </s>
<s> Alternatively you may all feel that creating a site that meets the needs of ordinary users, rather than technical users might be more urgent.  </s>
<s> I think the audience needs to be defined.  </s>
<s> Before we start looking at redesigning any site, we need to consider who our audience is going to be and what technical level we expect them to have.  </s>

<s> Can Jonathan or anyone else define what an -appropriate- symbol would be?  </s>

<s> Involvement/Information | Team |  Sponsors The navigation bar is meaningless to a first time visitor, and I suggest should not be on the home or splash page.  </s>
<s> This assumption holds if we expect the majority of our audience to be first time visitors.  </s>
<s> I don't think we've established that.  </s>
<s> In fact not within our 300 words.  </s>
<s> One link somewhere will lead out for those that have understood what comes before.  </s>
<s> Or, on the other hand, we could have a prominent "Is this your first time?  </s>
<s> Go here for an intro to WAI!" link before the navigation.  </s>
<s> That could lead into your proposed flip book.  </s>

<s> This is far too internally focused for a public site it is something from an intranet in the wrong place  </s>
<s> Once more, I'm not sure we -are- looking for the first-time visitor.  </s>
<s> The WAI site has to be a resource for WAI participants, and that may be more important than meeting the needs of first time visitors, who may be better served on a site like -- tooting my own horn -- the AWARE Center, which -is- designed for non-technical web designers.  </s>

<s> Especially since the huge majority of people don't know him by sight; I can't see how this helps apart from arbitrary decoration.  </s>
<s> Now, as far as arbitrary decoration goes, this isn't that bad, and it does add a humanizing factor to the page -- but I see that as general usability and not accessibility for people with disabilities.  </s>

<s> Why does neither the navigation bar nor the next section "Resources on Web Accessibility " follow the mission statement?  </s>
<s> There is not any point in making this list and then confusing people by immediately ignoring it.  </s>
<s> This is a good point but not, as I see it, a usability issue again.  </s>
<s> When you start making lists like this, you probably should follow through on them later, as it shows a default structure for the content of the page.  </s>
<s> The WAI pages are not very good on information structure.  </s>

<s> I do not propose to go through all of this in detail.  </s>
<s> Suffice to say it is full of acronyms that are meaningless to the novice.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> The use of acronyms makes this hard to understand; I would say that they need to be spelled out whenever possible, which is to say, nearly all the time, and inline acronym notation (IAN) should be used constantly.  </s>

<s> Well I have to agree with Kynn that most of my concerns are about the usability of the WAI homepage and site in general.  </s>
<s> Mission The W3C's commitment to lead the Web to its full potential includes  </s>
<s> promoting a high degree of usability for  </s>
<s> people with disabilities...  </s>
<s> This for me gives the game away.  </s>
<s> We state that we are concerned with usability, but who has the site been tested on?  </s>
<s> It is obvious to me at least that it has been tested on techies.  </s>
<s> So at the very best we are saying " look folks a site thats accessible to techies" whereas the hype would have you believe we are concerned for all.  </s>
<s> Usability means tested, and the WAI site has just not been tested on people who are starting out.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see a home page that had everything, sound, symbols, ASL, real video, you name it, AND degraded well with cross browser compatibility.  </s>
<s> In the meantime I believe the techies will quickly find the deliberate cheats through to techno heaven and the masses can learn the basics of what WAI is about both by example and content.  </s>
<s> Let me tell you an experience from today.  </s>
<s> A very old and dear friend of mine,is a special needs teacher, she has had a computer about a year.  </s>
<s> I spoke to her today on the phone, and she had been trying to show the site to a mutual friend.  </s>
<s> She had my email address in her book jay@peepo.com  </s>
<s> so she had got as far as www.jay@peepo.com as a possible site address.  </s>
<s> Anyway the fact was she is obviously confused.  </s>
<s> These are the bedrock of people trying to find a way of using the web to share information and enable CD clients.  </s>
<s> Without doubt in the top 10% of staff working directly with CD, and of above average intelligence for the UK.  </s>
<s> They desperately need good information, and WAI should be the place to come.  </s>
<s> If we need another project fine, I am happy to jump ship, but I believe it needs to be in the W3C family, and pretty closely related to WAI. jay@peepo.com  </s>
<s> special needs teacher web accessibility consultant  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced it's been tested on -anyone-.  </s>
<s> I don't find this site acceptable for most people who could be considered the core audience for the WAI site -- and I'm also not convinced that the WAI has -defined- that core audience.  </s>
<s> However, I'd better stop here, as our goal is to find a good example site rather than beat up on whoever has responsibility for the WAI site.  </s>
<s> Whether or not I find it acceptable (and I don't), we need to remember that our purpose is understanding issues of accessibility for people with disabilities, and not critiquing the WAI site.  </s>

<s> So if we would make tall enough barriers instead of curb-cuts they would be accessible because everybody would suffer or not accessible if there could still be couple of very athletic people jumping over?  </s>
<s> I think that especially when we start thinking about CD, usability becomes a greater issue for accessibility.  </s>
<s> In my opinion a non-usable site (for generic users) cannot be very accessible for disabled.  </s>
<s> Usually the site is designed for some purpose and if no-one can achieve their goals does not help users with special needs at all.  </s>
<s> Ofcourse usability can be defined and measured in many ways so there might be some cases were I agree with you.  </s>
<s> For instance, it might be that users not relying on visual information might find an otherwise non-usable graphic site accessible.  </s>
<s> But I wouldn't call the site generally accessible (or usable) in that case.  </s>
<s> It would just be accessible for that user group, in that context for achieving certain goals.  </s>
<s> Marja  </s>
<s> To take this back to the discussion it came from: There are people who have various disabilities which make them much more prone to confusion (short term memory problems, inability to concentrate for long periods, difficulty understanding things in textual form, and a range of other functional limitations).  </s>
<s> For these people, becuase of their disability, it is significantly more difficult to cope with a site that has poor information structure.  </s>
<s> As a direct result of their particular disabilities.  </s>
