Hi, I was wondering if anyone has written some code to convert a XML document into XML DOM specification model. 
If so I would love to try it out. 
Thanks !

There are numerous DOM implementations for XML. 
The xml.com DOM resources page has links to some, and pretty much all of them are mentioned somewhere in http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgmlnew.html 
(Robin Cover's SGML news page); search for DOM and you'll find a bunch. 
I'd suggest looking at IBM's "alphaWorks" implementation, Sun's "ProjectX", Datachannel/Microsoft's XML parser/DOM engine ... the URLs are sure to be in the SGML News page somewhere. 
Does anyone have a more specific URL that has links to the existing DOM implementations?
