What is the complete list of "user agents" in widespread deployment that cannot understand that kind of rudimentary JavaScript? 
How many people use those? 
What does it matter ? 
Baseline capabilities have improved considerably since the publication of WCAG 1.0 in 1999, that's why. 
WCAG 1.0 authors were anti-everything, really: Anti-images, anti-tables, anti-JavaScript, anti-multimedia. 
Let's get over that, shall we? 
But each visitor has a different physical reality. 
Yours is different from mine - for which I am ever so grateful Nice. 
Say that to my face sometime and see how I respond. 
Accessibility involves making as few assumptions about the physical realities of others as possible: We're talking not about bodies but about user agents. 
The exact version of a browser is of no particular interest. 
Its capabilities are directly relevant to the publication of accessibility guidelines. 
Where is the evidence that anyone other than a few privacy freaks and Slashdot-reading Linux nerds turn JavaScript off? 
How many of them are disabled? 
Frankly I find this offensive. 
Is this what you teach people who come to you for advice and knowledge about accessibility ? 
Care to answer my question first? 
Indeed, will anybody actually answer the questions, or are you going to have another fun day bitching about my tone?

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ Why are you responding to a message posted to the Interest Group mailing list with one to the Working Group List[1]? 
Especially given that a search of the archives suggests the person you are responding to isn't subscribed to the Working Group list? 
I'd rather not. 
I'm quite happy providing content in a way which can be accessed by people who can't, or won't, use browsers capable of coping with the above. 
I find it unsurprisingly difficult to access websites that depend on large images and complex JavaScript while sitting on the train using the browser built into my phone. 
Lets continue to treat the term "accessible" as "accessible to as many people as possible, including those who use a browser that supports HTML but not images, scripting, or multimedia". 
Accessibility involves making as few assumptions about the physical realities of others as possible: Bodies become rather important when no existing user agent, is able to present the user with the content, and the only theoretical ones demand more processing power then is available to the average user. 
[1] Yes, I've CCed it back.

If so, I'm going with "another fun day", until Judy tells us all to knock it off.

Inland Anti-Empire Blog http://inlandantiempire.org Ok Lets kill this line of discussion - especially since it looks like it might have been misposted to this list to start with. 
But no matter. 
If there is an issue, please post it as a new thread with - problem - suggestion for solution. 
Thanks.
