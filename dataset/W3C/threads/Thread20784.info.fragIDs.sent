<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Developing a script for teaching today involved trying to download an 80Mbyte file from the web.  </s>
<s> Amaya 5.2 (non-Gtk) [linux 2.2.19] crashed after reading 2^31 bytes!  </s>
<s> Until the latest Netscape and Mozillas they didn't crash but behaved very erratically once the 'number' had 'gone negative' - only to behave alright again after 2^32 bytes.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure why this would trouble you.  </s>
<s> 2^31 is 2 GB and 2^32 is 4 GB. 80 MB, although a suitably impressive download size, is only about 0.08 GB.  </s>

<s> Eek! Of course you are correct - so what is magic about 20,000,000 (roughly) which causes Amaya to fall over - thinks - that should have been 2^21 NOT 2^31.  </s>
