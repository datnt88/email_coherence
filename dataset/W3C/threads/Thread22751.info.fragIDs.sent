<s> I've got some very basic DOM questions that I'm sure have been discussed here before, but it's been tough searching for anything in the archives, and I've run out of time.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your patience.  </s>
<s> First, I wanted to verify that the read-only attribute of a Node is implementation-specific as of DOM Level 2. DOMException provides for  </s>
<s> NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR which may be raised when modifications to an object are not allowed, but application-level determination of the read-only state is not defined by the DOM interfaces, and must be defined by the implementation.  </s>
<s> Is that a correct statement?  </s>
<s> Secondly, I'm wondering about Node.removeChild.  </s>
<s> DOM2-Core specifies that NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR be raised if "this node is read only."  </s>
<s> We can assume that "this" refers to the parent of the child being removed.  </s>
<s> But what  </s>
<s> about the child itself?  </s>
<s> If parent of the child is not read-only, and the  </s>
<s> child being removed is read-only, wouldn't attempts to remove the child raise the same exception?  </s>
<s> Isn't "removal" of a child akin to "modification" of that child?  </s>
<s> Same thing can be asked of Node.replaceChild.  </s>
<s> For that matter, when a child is removed or replaced, what is supposed to happen to it's Node.ownerDocument?  </s>
<s> Christopher Watson Sr. Software Engineer Lightspan, Inc.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 1, and Level 2, have two specific cases in which nodes will be read-only: when they're Entity or EntityReference nodes or are descendents of one of these.  </s>
<s> (It's a bit hard to find this when casually searching the  </s>
<s> DOM spec, I admit, since the term "readonly" is also an IDL keyword.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should have distinguished read-only nodes and readonly IDL attributes, or used "immutable" or some other term.  </s>
<s> It's probably a bit late to change it now.) But we don't explicitly say that these are the only ways a node may become readonly.  </s>
<s> Some implementations do provide other mechanisms -- some DOMs are entirely read-only -- and while we haven't exactly blessed them we haven't explicitly forbidden them either.  </s>
<s> There has certainly been interest in the DOM working group in the possibility of making specific nodes or subtrees read-only on demand (and possibly in restoring mutability later), and there's been an active request from the XSLT community for a clearly defined "read-only DOM" (since they don't want to let user-written extensions change the source document while a stylesheet is running)... but we haven't yet reached consensus on whether this is a subset or a mode and exactly how it should behave, It's logged as an Open Issue to be reconsidered at a later date.  </s>
<s> what  </s>
<s> We explicitly allow a readonly node to be removed/reparented, _IF_ its parent is not readonly.  </s>
<s> In particular: EntityReference nodes are explicitly readonly (see above), but EntityReferences may be inserted and removed freely.  </s>
<s> Their informational content is immutable; their context is not.  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/DOM/faq.html#ownerdoc.  </s>
<s> (The proposed DOM Level 3 adoptNode() method would alter this statement slightly... but only when that method is explictly invoked, and only in specific situations where the DOM implementation knows it can get away with changing the node's ownerDocument.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Please keep the discussion on the mailing list rather than private e-mail... thanks...  </s>
<s> what does document.removeChild(document.documentElement)  </s>
<s> do?  </s>
<s> The definition of NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED says it's thrown "If an attempt is made to modify an object where modifications are not allowed."  </s>
<s> I believe this qualifies.  </s>
<s> You're right, this could be made clearer.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> I have got to find a "Entity and EntityReference Objects for Dummies" document somewhere.  </s>
<s> I am just NOT getting it.  </s>
<s> The spec is too concise for  </s>
<s> me.  </s>
<s> I need some unbridled prose to help me understand what all the relationships are, where and how they live, what in the source document prompts a DOM implemenation to create an EntityReference node, and how it is supposed to "link up" to an Entity.  </s>
<s> Anyone got a URL I can look at for this?  </s>
<s> !-- Joseph has already summarized for me priovately (thanks!), and pointed me to the XML Recommendation.  </s>

<s> Thanks, Joseph.  </s>

<s> Christopher Watson Sr. Software Engineer Lightspan, Inc.  </s>
<s> First question: How well do you understand XML entities in the first place?  </s>
<s> Our objects are driven by what the XML Recommendation says about how entities are used (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-references) and defined (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-entity-decl).  </s>
<s> Entity References are bound to the Entity definition which has the same name; that's built into the XML spec and is handled automagically by the DOM.  </s>
<s> Two complicating factors: 1) There isn't an API in DOM Level 1 or Level 2 for creating/changing/removing Entity (definition) nodes.  </s>
<s> That's because those versions of the DOM deliberately deferred most of DTD/Schema issues.  </s>
<s> We provided a place for parsers to hang the data, but how it gets there was deliberately left as implementation-specific pending DOM Level 3's "abstract schema" support.  </s>
<s> 2) As noted in the DOM spec, parsers are permitted to fully expand Entity References -- replacing them with their value, rather than presenting that value as children of an appropriate EntityReference node.  </s>
<s> If your parser is doing this, you'll never see EntityReference nodes in your document tree unless you create them explicitly.  </s>
<s> (There are arguments for and against this expansion, depending on whether your application does or doesn't want to know where the boundaries were... so the DOM deliberately left this open.  </s>
<s> Some parsers actually let you pick which mode you prefer by setting a flag before you parse.) Hope that gets you pointed in the right direction.  </s>

<s> Hi there, I need to be working with forms in xml, how do i proceed.  </s>
<s> I mean, what tools do I need to be using!  </s>
<s> Are there any examples or urls out there, which I could refer.  </s>
<s> Does CGI perl or CGI c support the processing of my xml forms.  </s>
<s> Thanks Naveen  </s>
<s> By forms, I mean - like the html forms.  </s>
<s> When an end user wants to send some data to the server he/she needs to fill in the "user info or requiremnets".  </s>
<s> If I wish to use xml, instead of the html how would I proceed.  </s>
<s> I think my question makes some sense.  </s>
<s> It makes sense, but not exactly as you've asked it.  </s>
<s> XML itself is really a meta-language -- a "langauge for writing languages".  </s>
<s> By itself it's pure syntax, and has no meaning; meaning is assigned by the specific XML-based language you're working in.  </s>
<s> If you're familiar with SGML, you can think of XML as occupying the same niche.  </s>
<s> There are a number of different XML-based languages which include the concept of forms.  </s>
<s> In addition to the language itself you'll need a tool on the client system which understands how to present the particular language you've chosen in a form that the user can interact with, gather the user's responses, and send that data to the server.  </s>
<s> Which langauge, and which tool, would be best depends on your exact needs.  </s>
<s> The minimal-effort choice would be XHTML., which is essentially a dialect of HTML based on XML (rather than being based on SGML, as is the case for traditional HTML).  </s>
<s> The downside is that XHTML is no more powerful, and just as architecturally ugly, as HTML... but the advantage is that well-written XHTML will actually work in most existing HTML browsers.  </s>
<s> If you need to do something more sophisticated than that, you'll have to do some research to find out what other forms langauges have been based on XML and which of them have client software that will run on your machines and talk to your servers.  </s>
<s> One interesting option would be to focus specifically on XForms; see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/ for more information.  </s>
<s> In any case, this isn't really a DOM question.  </s>
<s> It'd be a more appropriate topic for the XML-DEV mailing list ; you can learn more about that discussion at http://xml.org/xml-dev/index.shtml  </s>
