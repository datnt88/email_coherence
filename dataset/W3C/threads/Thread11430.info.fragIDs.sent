<s> Dear Editors, Could You explain to me, what do You want to signify, when You said: ---------[start of cut]---------- "Characters include the Latin letter "A", the Cyrillic letter "I", the Chinese character meaning "water", etc." ---------[end of cut]---------- I would like to know, what words "Cyrillic letter 'I'" mean?  </s>
<s> There are two letters in Russian that can match to this description: the letter "I" or "Simple I"(outline is: "|/|") and the letter "Short I"(it is a letter "Simple I"("|/|") with small dash above it).  </s>
<s> Which of these letters You mention in specification?  </s>
<s> Sincerely yours Aleksey.  </s>

<s> The letter referred to is described by a Unicode reference later on: "Here are some examples of numeric character references: ..." * &amp;#1048; (in decimal) represents the Cyrillic capital letter "I".  </s>
<s> So, in effect, you are correct that "Cyrillic letter 'I'" by itself is confusing, but the Unicode reference should tell you exactly which character we're referring to.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Ian  </s>
