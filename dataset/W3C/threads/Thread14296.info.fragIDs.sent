Hi, Gregory Perhaps that's an problem. 
The assumption you're making is that there is no problem because the clients will be incorporating the user agent guidelines. 
First, where does that leave blind people these days and in the near future? 
Second, how many developers of user agent technology are going to incoporate the standards? 
For example, what was the participation of Netscape/Mozilla in the process of developing the standards? 
I wonder how much Microsoft is willing to actually implement in IE. 
The guidelines should be inline with current technology. 
If the technology changes, the guidelines should also change. 
However, setting up the guidelines to work with technology which doesn't exist is creating another technology gap into which disabled people will fall. 
The technology I've developed is not transforming an existing web page into another type of web page. 
As I've said before, there is a technological limit on transforming on the basis of semantic content. 
The technology I've developed allows for creating highly flexible, adaptable web pages which are tailored to each user's needs. 
This is the direction that sites which are B2C or B2B are heading rather than forcing all users to use the same web page. 
Scott PS An interesting result I got from my experiment was that a couple of people who sue and like JFW 3.5 still preferred using the web pages formatted for blind users. 
The organization of the web page designed for blind users was easier to work with. 
aloha, scott! 
while i am in the midst of composing a more complex post about the interdependence of the three WAI guidelines documents in assuring users efficient means of orientation when inside a FORM and when navigating FORMS, i did want to point out that several of the problem statements and proposed solutions you posted to the list yesterday, on the topic of blind users' interaction with forms, have been addressed as part of the techniques on forms contained in the Techniques for the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines in particular, refer to the Form Techniques section, which is located at: and which is divided into the following sub-sections 1. Form navigation techniques 2. Form orientation techniques 3. Form control orientation techniques 4. Form submission techniques as well as in the following excerpts from techniques for specific UAAG checkpoints Techniques for Checkpoint 7.5 + For forms, allow users to find controls that must be changed by the user before submitting the form. 
Allow users to search on labels as well as content of some controls. 
Techniques for Checkpoint 8.6 + Provide a structured view of form controls (e.g., those grouped by LEGEND or OPTGROUP in HTML) along with their labels. 
Techniques for Checkpoint 9.2 + Allow the user to configure script-based submission (e.g., triggered by an "onChange" event). 
For instance, allow these settings: 1. Do not allow script-based submission. 
2. Allow script-based submission after confirmation from the user. 
3. Allow script-based submission without confirmation from the user. 
+ Users who navigate a document serially may think that the submit button in a form is the "last" control they need to complete before submitting the form. 
Therefore, for forms in which additional controls follow a submit button, if those controls have not been completed, inform the user and ask for confirmation (or completion) before submission. 
Techniques for Checkpoint 10.3 + Provide information about which keys activate form controls. 
-- end list of selected UAAG Techniques of course, these are in-the-future solutions, but many of them are readily implementable... how implementable, i suppose, will be put to the test -- first during the Proposed Recommendation (a.k.a. member-review) period for the User Agent Guidelines, which ends on 7 april 2000, and then in the ensuing months, when new releases of, and/or updates for, user agents begin to appear... by the way, have you given any thought of making your transformation utilities/applications/applets available as proxy servers? 
you have some very effective methods of exposing content to anyone experiencing the web in a linear fashion, which could be more widely tested by running a proxy server which would redeliver transformed pages to users... that, i personally, believe, is a very sound interim strategy, and one that will benefit a lot of people not only in the short term, but for some time to come -- especially those who don't have access to the latest in adaptive technology, the latest releases of script-capable browsers, those working in script-incapable environments, and anyone who really hates all of the advertising and attention-grabbing gimmicks on the web! for the long term, i'm still firmly in favor of client-side solutions, but, then again, i'm getting awfully tired of experiencing the web mostly by listening to and tweaking and then reloading document source... on the other hand, i am quite impressed by how clearly JFW 3.5 can expose visually oriented/rendered content and how it has greatly enhanced the navigational and orientation capacities available to me, but then, i am fortunate enough to own a copy of JFW 3.5 and a computer (with enough processing power and RAM) upon which to run it and several different browsers... gregory 
aloha, scott! 
i'm not quite sure how to respond to your latest post to the GL list addressed to me, but i'm going to attempt a response anyhow... gregg, in deference to your appeal to this list's subscribers to re-think and carefully review their comments before they post them to the GL list, i promise to re-read this at least 5 times before sending it!

For example, what was the participation of Netscape/Mozilla in the process of developing the standards? 
I wonder how much Microsoft is willing to actually implement in IE. unquote 1. your assumption about my assumption is wrong -- i was merely pointing you towards a co-dependent guidelines document in which several of the problems you identified have been explicitly addressed in a forwards-looking manner... of course there will be bumps and miscues as developers strive to achieve conformance to the guidelines documents, but that is part-and-parcel of the developmental process, is it not? 
and, since developers have been collaborating on the guidelines not only with representatives of a wide array of disability groups, but with assistive technology vendors, i expect that achieving the goals of the User Agent and Authoring Tool guidelines will be a far less painful process than making quote mainstream unquote applications accessible to users with disabilities has been in the past... 2. WAI guidelines are not holy writ, nor are they treated as such... what they are is the best attempt of a numerically small -- but extremely dedicated group of individuals, with widely varying backgrounds -- to provide guidance to individual page authors, user agent developers, assistive technology vendors, and authoring tool developers... 3. no, i don't expect the User Agent Guidelines to change my or anyone else's online experience overnight, but i do expect that enough pressure -- of the economic, moral, and regulatory kind -- has been brought to bear on the 4 targeted constituencies enumerated above, that i do fully expect developers to attempt to conform to both the User Agent Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Guidelines sooner, rather than later... both working groups have actively sought, and received feedback from developers, and both groups have been actively working _with_ developers to ascertain the implementability of the checkpoints they contain... moreover, both documents have been--on the whole--positively received by their target audiences, so yes, i do expect an honest effort on the part of developers to conform to the User Agent and Authoring Tool Guidelines 4. developer bashing is not only counter-productive, but -- in the case of developer participation in the WAI, and the W3C as a whole -- unfounded... there has been considerable developer input into the User Agent Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Guidelines -- in particular (and i apologize if i leave anyone out of this list), on the behalf of IBM, by Rich, Thatch, and Phil, as well as several of the IBM employees working on the Mozilla project who participated in the UA face2face meeting hosted by IBM in Austin in December 1999; and Microsoft, in particular in the person of Dick Brown (who is also a member of this working group, as are one or 2 other Microsoft employees) and in the person of Tim Lacey (especially at the UA face2face hosted by Microsoft last October, and hopefully at the upcoming UA face2face in april)... in addition, a number of other Microsoft employees have made concrete contributions to the UA Guidelines -- including such quote top level unquote project managers as Chris Wilson -- a name that should be familiar to readers of W3C recommendations! 
those i have mentioned by name above have been particularly generous in lending the UA WG their time and expertise... in particular, Rich Schwerdtfeger, the lead architect for IBM Special Needs Systems, has been an invaluable resource for several WAI working groups -- so much so that i have a feeling that Rich hasn't slept since 1997! 
note that, while i singled out IBM and Microsoft to illustrate this point, there are several other companies which are actively and constructively engaged in the effort to create a more accessible web by developing better, more configurable, and more accessible quote mainstream unquote user agents and authoring tools... 5. there has been a lot of passive participation -- by which i mean monitoring of the UA list, formal and informal reviews of working drafts, and periodic comments posted to the UA list -- by representatives of other quote mainstream unquote browser manufacturers such as Lakespur Rocca of Netscape, and H?kon Lie of Opera, as well as reps from Allaire, Lotus, and Real Networks, to name a few... 6. the User Agent Guidelines have benefited enormously from the active contributions and participation of several assistive technology developers -- in particular, Productivity Works, Alva Access Group, and Henter-Joyce... again, i have named names only as an illustration that 3 of the most influential adaptive technology manufacturers have been actively participating in the guidelines writing process... in addition, the contributions of the Trace Center, NCAM, CAST, and the University of Toronto's Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, to name but a few of the accessibility-oriented research and development projects, have been invaluable to the creation of the User Agent, Authoring Tools, Web Content, and Evaluation &amp; Repair documents, as well as the WAI in general... 7. the current Web Content guidelines do deal with current technology -- and the effort to revise and modularize the techniques document is an attempt to keep the document inline, as you put it, with current technology 8. current technology also includes: the W3C DOM, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, CSS2, XSL, XML, XSLT, JFW 3.5, Window-Eyes 4.0, HomePage Reader, PWWebSpeak, the Java Access Bridge for Windows, the Self-Voicing Kit for Java, VIPInfoNet, and BrailleNet, to name but a few of the programs that take advantage of the extended semantic and logical structural features of W3C promulgated (and PF-reviewed) markup languages 9. why did you casually dismiss the last 3 paragraphs of my post, in which i proposed that you set up a proxy server to deliver tailored content to users? 
if you want to improve the online experience of blind users in the most expeditious manner possible, the most efficacious means of doing so would be through the provision of a proxy server, and not by drafting yet another set of guidelines that may or may not be implemented... moreover, proxy served solutions would permeate through the audience you have targeted far more comprehensively and quickly than attempting to convince the maintainers of dynamically generated web sites to implement disability profiling... thus, i am at a loss as to why you are not willing to devote any effort in this direction... 10. have you investigated CC/PP, as ian and others have suggested? 
11. 
finally, what do quote B2B unquote and quote B2C unquote mean?

Hi, Gregory Let's hope you're right about the developers. 
However, why not as a safety net, include some features in the content guidelines which can be reasonably easily implemented in web pages in case the developers don't come through? 
If they do address the UA guidelines in their products, the content guidelines can be brought into line with the new browsers. 
I have looked at CC/PP . 
There are some interesting ideas, but their are certain holes also in terms of identifying needs of disabled people. 
As I've been taking on some endeavors outside the disabled world, I've been limiting myself to the issue of dynamically generated web pages in the disabled world. 
In the ecommerce world, B2C is business to customer web site and B2B is business to business customer web sites. 
Scott PS I did answer your last three paragraphs. 
I said there are certain technological limitations on transforming on the basis of semantic content. 
In the past I have tried to explain these technological limitations or boundaries. 
Unless someone has struggled with these software problems in natural language processing, language transformation or artificial intelligence, it is hard to explain the pitfalls in developing this type of software. 
Controlling the web page generation will give much more satisfactory results and it is consistent with the direction ecommerce is going. 
If you need me to respond more, it might be better to discuss this off-line. 
However, you might instead start doing reading in the area of language recognition/processing. 
Also, the area of linguistics which focuses on extracting concepts from language could be useful background. 
B2C is business to customer web site and B2B is business to business customer web sites. 
these terms are no longer limited to the ecommerce world and are now becoming mainstream and adapted for everyday use. 
Basically, everyone started with web sites that were brochureware. 
that is a way to post info about yourself or company and very little else. as the web evolved, the web became a marketing and cummunication arena. the term the internet is a medium, sales channel and service channel is now true. 
Print and other companies now use it as a medium to reduce costs in print, mail, customer service and calls and it is very effective at that!. sales channel refers to e-commerce which started out as posting catalogues, printing an ordering. 
service channel is frequently asked questions, search, email, and customer service. 
so B2C targets consumers and B2B target businesses. 
examples of B2B are extranets to businesses and campaigns targeted at businesses. 
for example the mint has one at http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/B2b/index.cfm along the way came the term online community. 
this is where companies build loyal followings of online visitors. 
think of the life now as a company's way of conducting e-business, which is internet, intranet, extranet, and e-commerce. 
this now requires content, operations business development, and site services.
