Per http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11 "Lists are not well formed" the RDFS spec now has reworded text for the collections vocab, following Peter's suggestion. 
See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0277.html for the discussion that led to this text. 
I need some advice: - what we agreed w/ Peter was text for 'rdf:first' and the assumption that similar changes would be needed for 'at least' rdf:List, rdf:rest. 
- I've tried to make such changes, could do with a sanity check especially rdf:nil seems awkward. 
Thanks. 
Sorry for the delay, am down to the last and vaguest issue now, ie. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11 
Dan This looked ok to me. 
I did find the note at the end of the intro to 5.2 awkward, but have failed in my attempt to write something better. 
Brian * Brian McBride bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com [2003-08-06 15:32+0100] Thanks for reviewing this. 
Yes, it is somewhat graceless, but I couldn't figure a way of expanding on it without opening the RDF/OWL layering wormcan... cheers, Dan
