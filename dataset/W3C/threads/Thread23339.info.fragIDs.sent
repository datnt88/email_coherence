<s> With the current interfaces there is good no way for a calling application to programatically decide what action to take according to the reason for parsing failure.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to extent the exising DOMError interface to include two more read only attributes: domain (DOMString) and error code (unsigned short).  </s>
<s> W3C could define a set of general error codes that parser  </s>
<s> implementations can choose to implement, but allows different implementations to extend the error code set in seperate domains.  </s>
<s> This way calling applications can look at the domain and error code and easily make a decision on what action to take (eg poorly formed XML versus I/O error versus validation error).  </s>
<s> From your description, it sounds like "domain" will be identify some broad area in which the error codes will be interpreted; is this right?  </s>
<s> Would example domains be things like "XML Conformance", "System Error", ...? -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Zope Corporation  </s>
<s> Open to suggestions.  </s>
<s> Coming from Apache's Xerces C++ implementation I'd suggest an URL.  </s>
<s> Say: DOM standard  </s>
<s> I know this does raise issues wrt to mapping implementation errors to w3c defined errors, and also implementations must decide when to return DOM error codes and when they should return error codes in other domains but I can't see a way to allow callers to have fine granularity of control any other way.  </s>
<s> This also allows W3C to grow the error code set as the general community require yet allowing implementations to press ahead without extending the standard through proprietry interfaces/methods.  </s>

<s> Whether the domain values are URIs or short strings specified in the DOM spec doesn't make any difference to me, since I'd expect language bindings to provide convenient named constants I can refer to.  </s>
<s> Judging from the current round of DOM 3 drafts, I'd expect the W3C to go for short strings, and forget to deal with namespace control within that space.  </s>
<s> (Such as reserving some prefix for future W3C use, and recommending some Java-esque reverse-domain prefix convention.) Reception seems to have been poor when I suggested clarifying that for the Load/Save specification, but I don't remember the exact response off the top of my head.  </s>
<s> (I still think that's important, and using URIs at least implicitly hints at that, if the W3C doesn't want to be specific on this topic.)  </s>
<s> Yes, which is nice.  </s>
<s> It might even be reasonable for the DOMError objects to provide a sequence of domain/code pairs, so that if an error matches some non-W3C error, and later a W3C-specified error code is defined, both can be associated with the error.  </s>
<s> That feels a bit heavy, but then, we are talking about the DOM, and error handling never has the same performance requirements as normal processing.  </s>
