<s> I recently had occasion to look at the DOMBuilder interface in the current "Level 3" WD: I'd like to suggest that four of the default feature settings are inappropriate.  </s>
<s> These should all default to 'false', not to 'true' - create-entity-ref-nodes - white-space-in-element-content - cdata-nodes - comments The rationale is that all those node types are "syntactic sugar" and not intended to convey logically significant information to applications.  </s>
<s> This means that creating them by default is inappropriate (it encourages _use_ of insignificant "sugar") as well as undesirable (it wastes memory).  </s>
<s> Applications that, for legacy reasons, want such sugar can ask that it be reported; other applications shouldn't need to bother.  </s>
<s> It may be worth considering "comments" separately, since they unfortunately show up (legacy processes?) in the XPath data model.  </s>
<s> I think it's appropriate to discourage their use everywhere, but reasonable people might expect a DOM to handle "full" XPath without needing to enable comments.  </s>
<s> Additionally, setting these flasgs to 'false' should be required, not  </s>
<s> optional; only the "comments" flag requires that.  </s>
<s> (That's implied by changing to defaults of 'false'.) Having "false" be optional forces applications to manually filter out such sugar, and makes this feature flag much less useful than it ought to be.  </s>
<s> I'd also suggest revisiting the "charset-overrides-xml-encoding" flag.  </s>
<s> Minimally, document that changing this default (to 'false') makes applications violate the XML standard.  </s>
<s> It'd be good to at least describe why this would be desirable.  </s>
<s> (For example, stating that it may be necessary to work around misconfigured web servers.) Related, the "validate-if-cm" flag has a similar issue.  </s>
<s> Setting it to "true" violates the XML specification of a validating parser; that should be identified as a reason to keep this flag cleared.  </s>
<s> Also, there seems to be some confusion in the text about whether to call these "properties" or "features".  </s>
<s> Please  </s>
<s> refer to them using only one term, preferably "features"  </s>
<s> or, for more suggestive language, "feature flags" (which captures the notion that these are boolean values).  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> Remember, one man's "syntactic sugar" is another man's "round-trip-ability".  </s>
<s> It's really hard to argue that either option is clearly preferable, which is why we're supporting both.  </s>
<s> Since it's trivial  </s>
<s> for users to explicitly override the defaults, and since it looks like half the population will do so no matter which defaults we set, I really don't find the syntactic-sugar argument a compelling one.  </s>
<s> The XML Recommendation explicitly says that processors _will_ deliver whitespace-in-element-content as part of the document's content (though it also says that this whitespace shall be flagged as being in element  </s>
<s> content, which past versions of the DOM didn't support).  </s>
<s> Our default should be for maximum conformance, and therefore should be to include these nodes.  </s>
<s> If the user explicitly requests that they be filtered out, we can do so... but we can't do it unless they ask for it.  </s>
<s> For the rest...  </s>
<s> I don't think it's desirable for different options to default in different directions, so the whitespace decision may constitute a sufficient precident to nail down the others.  </s>
<s> It strikes me as simpler to say "The default is to build everything, and the options allow you to  </s>
<s> filter out the portions you aren't interested in " than to try to explain the less-obvious concept of "filtering things in" -- especially if we are also allowing user-written filters, as has been proposed.  </s>
<s> Re properties versus features: DOM convention has been that the term "feature" replies to an optional module of the DOM API.  </s>
<s> If a flag doesn't control something which we've defined as a feature, we shouldn't use that term.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Not until supporting a "no-sugar" diet is "required", not "optional"; you seem to have ignored that (distinct) point.  </s>
<s> (Likewise the  </s>
<s> comments about two non-sugar feature flags -- which can be just doc fixups.) Since I've argued plenty for round-tripping support myself (though normally not using DOM :) I won't argue against it.  </s>
<s> I'll just say I think that sugar-aware round-tripping is in the 20% app space, not the 80% that should govern default settings.  </s>
<s> That doesn't follow.  </s>
<s> I think it's sufficient to provide that (ignorable whitespace) data on request.  </s>
<s> Though whitespace is always a messy issue, since strictly speaking only validating processors can be relied on to tell when it's ignorable.  </s>
<s> (Which is another doc issue that ought to be addressed.)  </s>
<s> My suggestion was to default more simply, not do so inconsistently: "The default is to record only things that are supposed to matter to applications, but you can save other syntax if you want."  </s>
<s> That doesn't resolve the issue though.  </s>
<s> Both "property" (in explanatory text) and "feature" (in the API) are both used.  </s>
<s> Perhaps switch over completely to unadorned term "flag"?  </s>
<s> That will involve changing the IDL ... which now uses "feature" to refer to something other than an  </s>
<s> optional module.  </s>
<s> (Why not call them "optional modules"?  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> Both modes are "requried" by some applications.  </s>
<s> Both modes are available,  </s>
<s> at the application's election.  </s>
<s> I don't think that provides particularly clear guidance re which should be the default, either way; setting a flag before parsing isn't exactly a major hardship or performance impact, and a convenience routine to yield a parser configured as you need it is fairly trivial.  </s>
<s> For that reason, I'm not really dogmatic about which way this should go.  </s>
<s> I do think that having the DOM default to building as complete a DOM as possible and filtering down from there is a touch cleaner, architecturally... but I grant that this is a matter of taste.  </s>
<s> "property" (in explanatory text) and "feature" (in the API) are both used.  </s>
<s> If they're both used to refer to the same things, we should certainly fix  </s>
<s> it.  </s>
<s> If it's a matter of "If this feature is supported by the DOM, it can be disabled by setting that property" (where the feature is the behavior/API and the property is the flag), we should consider whether our intent is clear and make sure that "property", like "feature", goes into the glossary.  </s>
<s> A bit late to change it now, especially given the hasFeature() method.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Exactly why I think it's wrong to make one of them "optional".  </s>
<s> Please go read that part of the spec to see what I've been talking about: some of the relevant flag settings are "optional".  </s>
<s> I'd like  </s>
<s> your next response to that point to indicate you at least can see the issue I've raised ... :)  </s>
<s> Architecturally, such issues can't matter ... unless things are set up the way they are now, so that the "filter down" (at build-time) approach can't work reliably!  </s>
<s> (See above.) Stylistically, it certainly does matter whether the default policy settings aim for the 80% or the 20%.  </s>
<s> I think the defaults now aim for the 20%, but I get the feeling some people like it that way.  </s>
<s> "property" (in explanatory text) and "feature" (in the API) are both used.  </s>
<s> As I said.  </s>
<s> Again, go read the WD ... I think that since some of the text needs to change, it'd really be better to use a word that captures the boolean nature of this beast, such as "flag".  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> So your concern is not the defaults per se (as your original phrasing seemed to suggest), but whether all implementations will permit you to override those defaults?  </s>
<s> If that's what you're seeing, then I agree that I have to reread the current draft.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> My original note reported five separate issues, including both the suboptimal defaults (one issue) AND this separate one:  </s>
