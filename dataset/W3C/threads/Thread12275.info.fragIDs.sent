<s> Crossposted to AU and ER Len identifies some important points.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> It is indeed useful to identify what tools meet the requirements.  </s>
<s> In fact, W3C process requires that this can be done for a recommendation.  </s>
<s> So we have two options - we can build the tools ourselves, or find tools that already implement the requirements.  </s>
<s> It is also useful for developers, who are trying to meet the guidelines, to have more guidance about what that means.  </s>
<s> Seeing the opinions of the working group is helpful in this regard.  </s>
<s> For the working group to have a good idea of how to make decisions on "line calls", and even more so for others, it is helpful to have a number of such decisions available to refer to.  </s>
<s> 2. There are indeed questions about what does "integrated into the look and feel mean".  </s>
<s> Again, the best way I know of to clarify this is by trying it.  </s>
<s> Some of the other cases, like the relative priority checkkpoints, are less complicated.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of work to test each one, but it is explained under relative priority that what is required is based on the checkpoints of WCAG.  </s>
<s> Developing techniques, and tests, is a lot of the current work in front of the AU group.  </s>
<s> 3. Vendor neutral is not the same as issue neutral, or silent.  </s>
<s> W3C is certainly not in a position to sit down and work on their favourite vendor's tools, or say that someone's software is all terrible.  </s>
<s> However, in order to demonstrate what we mean by the specification, in informative examples, it is reasonable to publish opinions expressed about how a particular tool does or does not meet the requirements, along with any subsequent debate on the issue.  </s>
<s> Not to do so would be tantamount to claiming the specification is perfect, and anyone who doesn't understand it is inadequate, which is likely to be almost diametrically wrong.  </s>
<s> Our comments, if we are working in good faith, are not likely to provide undeserved praise or blame in any great degree, and as a working group it is our job to watch over ourselves and each other, and test what we say against reality.  </s>
<s> I believe we are in fact capable of doing so (although I recognise that it is important to bear this in mind, and recall that we are none of us infallible).  </s>
<s> On another front, in the ER response to this thread, Kynn asked what was happening about the conformance and quality assurance person W3C was going to hire.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, his name is Karl Dubost and he will be beginning work at the start of July.  </s>
<s> (People who follow everything in AU may notice  </s>
<s> that he is in fact the person who produced the french translation of ATAG.  </s>
<s> Charles McCN There was a discussion in the last teleconference about providing a database telling whether various authoring tools meet ATAG.  </s>
<s> I'd like to focus on one of the issues.  </s>
<s> Do we rely on the tool providers to do self evaluation?  </s>
<s> Or does the W3C take on the role of evaluating tools?  </s>
<s> Taking off my chair hat I offer a few observations: 1.  </s>
<s> It would undoubtedly be useful for people to have an accurate account of whether tools meet ATAG. 2. However, some of the evaluation is subjective.  </s>
<s> For example, 3.2 requires "Help the author create structured content and separate information from its presentation."  </s>
<s> How much help is required to say this is satisfied, e.g. how many of the techniques in one?  </s>
<s> Five?  </s>
<s> etc. Similarly 4.1, checking for accessibility, references AERT, not a normative document, so evaluating satisfaction is subjective.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 5.2's "obvious and easily initiated" also worries me.  </s>
<s> As a human factors engineer, I've had lots of debates with people who thought something was obvious and easily intiated when the users didn't.  </s>
<s> 3. W3C is supposed to be vendor neutral.  </s>
<s> So, what I'm worried about is complaints about our subjective judgments favoring one company or another.  </s>
<s> Is there a subset of strictly objective specs that avoids this problem?  </s>
<s> OK, chair hat back on.  </s>
<s> Any comments?  </s>
<s> Len p.s. I copied this to Judy given the policy aspects.  </s>
