Crossposted to AU and ER Len identifies some important points. 
1. 
It is indeed useful to identify what tools meet the requirements. 
In fact, W3C process requires that this can be done for a recommendation. 
So we have two options - we can build the tools ourselves, or find tools that already implement the requirements. 
It is also useful for developers, who are trying to meet the guidelines, to have more guidance about what that means. 
Seeing the opinions of the working group is helpful in this regard. 
For the working group to have a good idea of how to make decisions on "line calls", and even more so for others, it is helpful to have a number of such decisions available to refer to. 
2. There are indeed questions about what does "integrated into the look and feel mean". 
Again, the best way I know of to clarify this is by trying it. 
Some of the other cases, like the relative priority checkkpoints, are less complicated. 
There is a lot of work to test each one, but it is explained under relative priority that what is required is based on the checkpoints of WCAG. 
Developing techniques, and tests, is a lot of the current work in front of the AU group. 
3. Vendor neutral is not the same as issue neutral, or silent. 
W3C is certainly not in a position to sit down and work on their favourite vendor's tools, or say that someone's software is all terrible. 
However, in order to demonstrate what we mean by the specification, in informative examples, it is reasonable to publish opinions expressed about how a particular tool does or does not meet the requirements, along with any subsequent debate on the issue. 
Not to do so would be tantamount to claiming the specification is perfect, and anyone who doesn't understand it is inadequate, which is likely to be almost diametrically wrong. 
Our comments, if we are working in good faith, are not likely to provide undeserved praise or blame in any great degree, and as a working group it is our job to watch over ourselves and each other, and test what we say against reality. 
I believe we are in fact capable of doing so (although I recognise that it is important to bear this in mind, and recall that we are none of us infallible). 
On another front, in the ER response to this thread, Kynn asked what was happening about the conformance and quality assurance person W3C was going to hire. 
As I understand it, his name is Karl Dubost and he will be beginning work at the start of July. 
(People who follow everything in AU may notice 
that he is in fact the person who produced the french translation of ATAG. 
Charles McCN There was a discussion in the last teleconference about providing a database telling whether various authoring tools meet ATAG. 
I'd like to focus on one of the issues. 
Do we rely on the tool providers to do self evaluation? 
Or does the W3C take on the role of evaluating tools? 
Taking off my chair hat I offer a few observations: 1. 
It would undoubtedly be useful for people to have an accurate account of whether tools meet ATAG. 2. However, some of the evaluation is subjective. 
For example, 3.2 requires "Help the author create structured content and separate information from its presentation." 
How much help is required to say this is satisfied, e.g. how many of the techniques in one? 
Five? 
etc. Similarly 4.1, checking for accessibility, references AERT, not a normative document, so evaluating satisfaction is subjective. 
Checkpoint 5.2's "obvious and easily initiated" also worries me. 
As a human factors engineer, I've had lots of debates with people who thought something was obvious and easily intiated when the users didn't. 
3. W3C is supposed to be vendor neutral. 
So, what I'm worried about is complaints about our subjective judgments favoring one company or another. 
Is there a subset of strictly objective specs that avoids this problem? 
OK, chair hat back on. 
Any comments? 
Len p.s. I copied this to Judy given the policy aspects.

Charles, will he be working on these kinds of issues that we've been discussing in the WAI, or am I not understanding what his job will be?

I am not sure exactly what he will be working on - Daniel Dardailler will know a lot better. 
But I believe he is looking at issues like those we have been discussing - methodologies, branding/certification and what its implications are, etc. Cheers Charles
