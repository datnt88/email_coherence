<s> Hi How the POST request is sent internally?  </s>
<s> Is the body of POST request is sent as (name, value) pair?  </s>
<s> Also can i send a POST request along with some parameters, some thing like below?  </s>
<s> POST /servername/some_virtual_directory/somefile.asp?id=x&amp;name=y  </s>
<s> Some headers... and then body.. thanks, regards, Naresh Agarwal  </s>
<s> If the body of the POST request is the result of filling out a form, then the contents are name,value pairs as you expect.  </s>
<s> They will be url-encoded just like the GET request would be, but the name,value pairs are in the body, not the end of the url.  </s>
<s> Most CGI programs I have seen parse EITHER the end of the URL (query variables) for the GET method, OR they parse the body text for the POST method.  </s>
<s> BUT NOT BOTH.  </s>
<s> It is possible to send such a request, but I don't know how to get a standard browser to do it.  </s>
<s> If you are writing your own sender, you could build such a request, but most CGI programs will ignore the url query variables.  </s>

<s> The format for forms submission is not in the HTTP specification, it's in the HTML specification.  </s>
<s> Other forms languages might use different formats and protocols for transmission of forms data.  </s>
<s> HTML 4.0.1 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13 specifies how different attributes of the FORM element (method, enctype) control how the form data is encoded, at least when the 'action' is a HTTP URI.  </s>
<s> There are only 3 cases specified: method get, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded method post, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded method post, enctype multipart/form-data There is no combination of parameters in HTML 4.0.1 defined that will generate combinations of url encoding and form-data.  </s>
<s> While some forms processors will also accept ';' instead of '&amp;' as a field separator in application/x-www-form-urlencoded, it isn't mandated in HTML 4.0.1.  </s>
<s> Of course, other kinds of forms are possible, and compatible with HTTP, but not necessarily with different HTTP server's predefined modules for handling HTML forms.  </s>
