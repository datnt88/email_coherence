<s> According to PR-DOM-Level-1-19980818, DOM Attribute objects inherit the Node interface, but since they are not actually child nodes of the element they describe, the DOM does not consider them part of the document tree.  </s>
<s> If it weren't for the fact that the immediately following sentence, Thus, the Node attributes parentNode, previousSibling, and nextSibling have a null value for Attribute objects.  </s>
<s> doesn't mention ownerDocument I would have assumed that not being 'part of the document tree' would imply that this attribute would be null too.  </s>
<s> Can anyone reassure me that a null value would be conforming?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Miles  </s>
<s> I would have thought that ownerDocument should be non-null, so that the Attribute can readily clone itself.  </s>
<s> However, this is probably my COM bias talking again... Alfie.  </s>
<s> Attribute.ownerDocument is not null.  </s>

<s> The Attribute should know which structure model it is part of, i.e. which document tree it is associated with.  </s>
<s> Thus ownerDocument should not be null for Attributes that are associated with Elements.  </s>

<s> As the spec says: "In the DOM Level 1, objects implementing some interface "X" are created by a "createX()" method on the Document interface; this is because all DOM objects live in the context of a specific Document."  </s>
<s> As it also says: "Since elements, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, etc. cannot exist outside the context of a Document, the Document interface also contains the factory methods needed to create these objects.  </s>
<s> The Node objects created have a ownerDocument attribute which associates them with the Document within whose context they were created."  </s>
<s> As it also says, "Provides access to the Document object associated with this Node.  </s>
<s> This is also the Document object used to create new Nodes.  </s>
<s> When the Node is a Document this is null."  </s>
<s> I see no justification whatsoever for believing that ownerDocument would be null in the case of attributes.  </s>
<s> If a user of the API were to rely on ownerDocument to create new nodes as children of an AttributeNode, it certainly had better be non-null.  </s>
