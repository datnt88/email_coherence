Hi all, I'd like to add an extension to mod_dav that provides a live property that can be queried/set, which corresponds to "executable" permissions in a Unix file system. 
Joe Orton has also said he'd provide the corresponding capability on the client. 
We just need to settle on How To Do It Right, so I'll come here to ask... :-) The scenario for this is uploading a CGI script. 
When the script is first placed, it won't have the executable flags turned on. 
The client then follows up with a PROPPATCH to turn the flags on. 
So... I've got a few questions here: * is there a more general semantic to use? 
e.g. all permission types rather than just executable? 
* this doesn't really feel like an ACL -- this is actually stating "this resource should be executable", rather than adjusting who can interact (and how) with the resource * should I place this into the DAV: namespace, or use a private one? 
(I'd use http://www.webdav.org/props/ if DAV: wasn't appropriate) Other comments/suggestions appreciated, as always!

This is my worry. 
Are people going to come along and say "But I want my scripts to be chmod 0700" (or whatever)? 
I'm more tempted by a "unix-permissions" type property, and allowing access to the real file permissions as an octal value.

- Jim Russ Pridemore It seems to me that this issue could best be dealt with by the DAV server configuration instead of depending on clients. 
A developer working with Windows systems for both client and server could neglect to set this property and see no ill effects. 
Until the product shipped and someone tried their client with a UNIX server.

Here's the slippery slope. 
What is really needed are more than just executable permissions. 
But, creating just a Unix permissions property doesn't handle interoperability very well, since it doesn't map especially well to non-Unix filesystems. 
Then, once you start looking at the needed access permissions for DAV, you realize that the ability to create a resource, then share it with other users is also important. 
Next thing you know, you're dealing with just about the same set of issues as are in the access control draft. 
Yaron's been promising a new revision of the ACL spec. 
for some time now, and I'm anxiously awaiting it. 
If you have other ideas on how this should work, please write them up in either a mail message, or better yet, an Internet-Draft. 
Heck, even writing up the Unix permissions property idea would be useful, since it would act as a good null-hypothesis to anything else we come up with.
