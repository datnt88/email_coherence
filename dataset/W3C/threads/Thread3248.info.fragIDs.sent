Hi, 
I would like to start and collect the usual problems you have identified in Authoring Tools (Requirements, etc). 
It has to be related to Web standards in a way. 
Thanks. Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- 
Hi Karl, 
I work with the Web Standards Project on a team called the Dreamweaver Task Force. 
You can read about us here: If you'd like to discuss standards issues relating to Macromedia Dreamweaver, we'd be happy to talk with you.

Thanks Drew. 
It's why I'm inviting people to send their comments about the tools and what are the things that could be improved or missing features. 
When all the people will have expressed their requirements, we'll be able to see how to write a document to address these issues and work with all authoring tools makers to improve the products. 
Best.
