with: Mozilla 0.9.5 The reviewer found the following accessibility problems with your page or site. 
Each item is followed by a link to relevant information in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (that you can find at Page inaccessible and no alternative page available (Refer to Checkpoint 11.4) Other: Completely blocks access to browsers other than Internet Explorer 5, including browsers that are entirely standards-compliant (I tried Opera 5, Mozilla 0.9.5, and Konqueror). 
The only thing I see are links for downloading Internet Explorer for Windows or Macintosh (useless, since I use Linux). 
You say you're complying to the standards, but you're not: being standards compliant includes being *accessible*, i.e. by any standards-compliant browser. 
Your name and the url of your page, along with the names of other page reviewed using this tool, have been entered in a W3C WAI database that we maintain (currently implemented as an archived mailing list visible at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-report-db). 
Please take the time to review this is taken care of by morning.
