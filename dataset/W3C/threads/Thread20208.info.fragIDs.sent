<s> The source editing thing is quite cool.  </s>
<s> There are not many times when I have wanted that feature, since I learned how to use the structure view, but I guess I will use it more now that I have it ;-) Charles McCN Hi, Before the usual (and legitimate) rush of "this_is_buggy and miss_this_feature" start, as after every new relase, I just wanted to thank and congratulate the Amaya team.  </s>

<s> Hello Jean Raymond, The problem you have is more related to libwww and its use of SOCKS5 than to Amaya.  </s>
<s> I propose you forward your problem to the www-lib@w3.org  </s>
<s> mailing list.  </s>
<s> I've not yet done any SOCKS programming, but you have pinpointed the problem quite well.  </s>
<s> I'd say that the solution would just be to remove the fclose from the wwwsys.h  </s>
<s> file and try to compile again.  </s>
<s> I don't think that a fclose is related to sockets anyway :) Could you try it and report back to either this list or www-lib?  </s>
<s> I have some Amaya and libwww tips for you, though ... Did you get your libwww from w3c's CVS repository using the Amaya tag?  </s>
<s> If not, you'll have other problems when making the link edition.  </s>
<s> I changed some functions in libwww, but haven't yet commited them to the principal tree.  </s>
<s> I'll mail a more explicit message to the list later.  </s>
<s> The files are HTMIME.c  </s>
<s> HTCache.c HTReqMan.c  </s>
<s> HTCache.html HTReqMan.html  </s>
<s> HTReq.html and are available on the libwww CVS base (Amaya tag).  </s>
<s> For this release, I modified the libwww portion of the Amaya makefile so that it links directly to the libwww's .libs  </s>
<s> directories.  </s>
<s> I didn't make much progress to allow you define another libwww directory or handle it some options, though.  </s>
<s> So, if you're using another libwww than ours, you'll need to either name it libwww (or make symlink named like that) or modify the ~/Amaya/Makefile.in and ~/Amaya/amaya/Makefile.libwww files to make them point to the correct location of libwww (2-3 lines to modify).  </s>
<s> Hope this helps you!  </s>
<s> Thanks, -Jose  </s>
<s> Jean Raymond, I asked on the libwww list and I haven't got any definitive answer yet.  </s>
<s> I removed the fclose SOCKSfclose definition in the wwwsys.h  </s>
<s> file and was able to build a working Amaya/socks version.  </s>
<s> Alas, I don't have any SOCKS server to test it.  </s>
<s> I was able to browse out, though.  </s>
<s> My guess is that SOCKSfclose was defined in socks4 and then obsoletted in socks5.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps you, -Jose  </s>
