<s> Hi There, While going through technical jargons, I came across this term 'Http-Tunneling'.  </s>
<s> It is said that using this,it is possible to send data of any protocol through proxy over HTTP.Can any one tell me how this can be achieved?  </s>
<s> any sample code will provide good idea or send me the urls where I can get the basics of http-tunneling.  </s>
<s> Is it possible to tunnel complex protocols which are used by 'Microsoft  </s>
<s> Netmeeting', or AIM etc? Thanks in advance!!! yog  </s>
<s> HTTP Tunneling is designed for Secure HTTP (HTTPS).  </s>
<s> A HTTP tunneling is a  </s>
<s> method of going through a proxy server, without the proxy server itself  </s>
<s> handling any data transmitted.  </s>
<s> A tunnel can be established with the connect method: CONNECT host : port HTTP/1.1 CRLF  </s>
<s> If the HTTP return code is 200 (OK), a connection is established.  </s>
<s> Now any  </s>
<s> data transmitted is directly forwarded (by the proxy server) to the  </s>
<s> end-point.  </s>
<s> Take note that most proxy server will only allow tunnels to port 443  </s>
<s> (HTTPS), due to security restrictions.  </s>
<s> So they're not usable for anything  </s>
<s> else than HTTPS.  </s>
<s> Some proxy servers (like the ISA server) can be configured  </s>
<s> to interfrere with the data on the tunnel.  </s>
<s> Contact the Proxy manual of admin.  </s>

<s> Somewhat, however you don't understand tunneling concept to well.  </s>
<s> There is a difference between proxying and tunneling: While acting as a proxy, you send a request to the proxy server, the same as you whould send to the orgin server.  </s>
<s> The proxy server can modify/change the request (even deny it or get it from cache).  </s>
<s> A tunnel will establish a connection from you to the other end-point (orgin server).  </s>
<s> This tunnel can be established through one one (or more) proxy server(s), who should not inferfere with the information send through the tunnel.  </s>
<s> To you it looks just like a normal TCP connection from you to the other end-point (actual end server).  </s>
<s> Some more background: tunneling was needed to establish a secure channel between two end-points.  </s>
<s> The property of a secure channel is that nobody, except the end-points, can send data over it and optionally cannot read it.  </s>
<s> Both is the case with HTTPS.  </s>
