<s> I just installed Amaya 2.5pre on Linux-Mandrake 7.0.  </s>
<s> I notice that the bug that had kept me from using 2.4 is fixed (structure view hangs when text cursor is moved to bottom of screen).  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I am surprised, however, that there is no obvious way I can bookmark like Lynx and Netscape allow.  </s>
<s> I think that functionality would make Amaya much easier to use for bringing in source material from scattered sites from time to time.  </s>
<s> Will we see bookmarking soon?  </s>
<s> Thanks. Eddie Maddox eddie@mngovsci.com  </s>

<s> As Amaya is an authoring tool, it's very easy to create and edit a page HotList.html.  </s>
<s> We considered that was enough.  </s>
<s> Do you think we have to add special functions for managing a default HotList.html?  </s>

<s> 2.5pre: other scrolling problems.  </s>
<s> Sometimes when scrolling backwards the scrolling just stops.  </s>
<s> Also, frequently, when scrolling fast, various flashes of color, double exposures, etc.  </s>
<s> When I stop scrolling, sometimes the spurious effect stays in effect.  </s>
<s> BTW, I'm running Mandrake 7.0 here, on an AMD K6/233, 64 MB. Eddie Maddox eddie@mngovsci.com  </s>
<s> It just now stopped when moving the text cursor downwards.  </s>
<s> It had most of the file to go yet.  </s>
<s> It's one of the Amaya Doc files that came with 2.5pre.  </s>
<s> Did anyone bother checking to see if little things like scrolling work right before putting 2.4 and now 2.5pre out?  </s>
<s> Don't people, when they write things like Amaya, try it out and make use of it?  </s>
<s> Then didn't those developing Amaya stumble over these broken things like the scrolling and fix them?  </s>
<s> But 2.4 was broken (structure view hung during trivial scrolling) and now 2.5pre, too, just broken differently, but just as broke.  </s>
<s> All that work on MathML, etc., but the scrolling is still broke, rendering the whole Amaya environment useless, MathML included, for several months now.  </s>
<s> I have _never_ been able to use Amaya.  </s>
<s> And I've been trying since 1.3.  </s>
<s> P.S. If you don't like this rant, I've got more, and not by choice.  </s>
