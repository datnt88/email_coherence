I just installed Amaya 2.5pre on Linux-Mandrake 7.0. 
I notice that the bug that had kept me from using 2.4 is fixed (structure view hangs when text cursor is moved to bottom of screen). 
Thanks. 
I am surprised, however, that there is no obvious way I can bookmark like Lynx and Netscape allow. 
I think that functionality would make Amaya much easier to use for bringing in source material from scattered sites from time to time. 
Will we see bookmarking soon? 
Thanks. Eddie Maddox eddie@mngovsci.com

As Amaya is an authoring tool, it's very easy to create and edit a page HotList.html. 
We considered that was enough. 
Do you think we have to add special functions for managing a default HotList.html?

2.5pre: other scrolling problems. 
Sometimes when scrolling backwards the scrolling just stops. 
Also, frequently, when scrolling fast, various flashes of color, double exposures, etc. 
When I stop scrolling, sometimes the spurious effect stays in effect. 
BTW, I'm running Mandrake 7.0 here, on an AMD K6/233, 64 MB. Eddie Maddox eddie@mngovsci.com 
It just now stopped when moving the text cursor downwards. 
It had most of the file to go yet. 
It's one of the Amaya Doc files that came with 2.5pre. 
Did anyone bother checking to see if little things like scrolling work right before putting 2.4 and now 2.5pre out? 
Don't people, when they write things like Amaya, try it out and make use of it? 
Then didn't those developing Amaya stumble over these broken things like the scrolling and fix them? 
But 2.4 was broken (structure view hung during trivial scrolling) and now 2.5pre, too, just broken differently, but just as broke. 
All that work on MathML, etc., but the scrolling is still broke, rendering the whole Amaya environment useless, MathML included, for several months now. 
I have _never_ been able to use Amaya. 
And I've been trying since 1.3. 
P.S. If you don't like this rant, I've got more, and not by choice.
