Hi all, just a quickie. 
I have a page (several actually) with a 'skip links' link at the top of the main nav menu. 
On showing this to some sighted users who I would assess as having limited experience of the internet but make up a sizeable proportion of my target audience I became aware that this link was confusing them. 
I therefore wanted to hide it and attached a css class with visibility set to hidden. 
Does doing this present any problems for the people that would benefit from a 'skip links' link. 
I'm pretty sure that screen readers will pick up the hidden link but just wanted to make sure. 
Any comments?

Hi Scarlett, I drove the inclusion of skip nav links in the 508 provisions when I was vice chair of EITAAC (electronic and information technology accessibility advisory committee) that proposed standards to the Access Board for 508. 
It was the first "formalization," even advocacy, of the idea. 
Skip navigation links are crucial for blind consumers to find the main content of a page, a process that is relatively easy if you can see and one that can be near impossible if you are blind. 
Since the EITAAC meetings, screen readers have improved and they do a better job of skipping over links. 
But a "skip to main content link" completely removes guesswork. 
The skip link has nothing to do with keyboard access - it is for blind access. 
If you can see the screen you can tab (very quickly) over a long list of links and watch the focus rectangle until it gets to where you want. 
A blind user cannot do that. 
You have to listen as you go ... and tabbing, of course, skips right over the main content. 
Put the skip link on an invisible gif, as you will find it on visible like on http://www.acb.org. 
Or make it the same color as background as at http://assistivetech.org. 
But don't use visibility: hidden styles - screen readers are taking that to mean that the visibility is hidden!

It's a good book!

the skip nav link has been one of the most difficult things and the most ill used and the most inadaquate cludge I have ever seen. 
My proposal was to have 508 requirees to write the sites so as to negate the need for one. 
This could have been done and is being done quite effectively. 
On sites that employ it, it often does not work, messes up tab order and is plain useless.
