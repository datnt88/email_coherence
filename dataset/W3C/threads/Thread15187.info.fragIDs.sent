<s> Hello, At today's telecon we discussed possible dates and locations for future F2F  </s>
<s> meetings.  </s>
<s> Here is the information I promised: 1. W3C All Group Meeting (a.k.a. the Technical Plenary). 3 - 7 March, Royal  </s>
<s> Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, MA USA 2. Conference on "Technology and Persons with Disabilities" (a.k.a.  </s>
<s> CSUN).  </s>
<s> 17-22 March, L.A., CA USA Information from last year's technical plenary is available.  </s>
<s> [1] One possibility is for a small group to attend the technical plenary and solicit feedback from other W3C groups then bring that feedback to a regular working group meeting that would occur after CSUN.  </s>
<s> Another possibility is to have two meetings with different goals.  </s>
<s> One could focus on technology-specifics (i.e., a working meeting similar to Linz) and the other could be regular meeting.  </s>
<s> Please send your preference for date and venue to me, Gregg, and Jason.  </s>
<s> Also, be sure to let us know if you support the idea of organizing  </s>
<s> two meetings (one at the plenary and one at csun).  </s>
