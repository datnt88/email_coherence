<s> On 30 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>
<s> A straw poll indicates the question needs further discussion in the work group.  </s>
<s> D.4 Should XML allow parameter entities and parameter-entity references?  </s>
<s> * D.4 a. internal parameter entities?  </s>
<s> * D.4 b. external parameter entities?  </s>
<s> Since we are not allowing any new convenience features in DTDs (like mix-in markup), we will continue to require the old parameter-entity methods for creating extensions.  </s>
<s> This is a requirement, now, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> I think that this is far worse for processors than external text entities, because they must be followed for the DTD to be useful (i.e. we cannot remove the serial dependencies as we have for external text entities).  </s>
<s> While it is sometimes useful to have external parameter entities, for most projects one can live without them.  </s>
<s> On balance we should drop this, or reconsider it in 2.0 in light of how hard it was to live without (and for how many people it was hard).  </s>

<s> Parameter entities are SGML text entities.  </s>
<s> XML shouldn't have SGML text entities.  </s>
<s> It is now clear that (the recent TAG editorial to the contrary notwithstanding) XML is a conforming "profile" of SGML, which is as it should be.  </s>
<s> XML 1.0 should be as simple as possible to encourage rapid implementation.  </s>
<s> XML 2.0 can have a richer set of SGML features.  </s>
