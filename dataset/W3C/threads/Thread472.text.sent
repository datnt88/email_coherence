IBM Product Lifecycle Management has a business partner that develops a software product that IBM markets and supports. 
As part of the development effort, the business partner creates the end-user product information in HTML. 
When we send this source to our IBM translation centers, the tool that checks the HTML files for compliance with our HTML guidelines (which are based on W3's) always finds errors. 
The business partner creates the files with MS FrontPage. 
We have a deviation that allows them to use the FONT attribute for "human factors" reasons, even though it's a problem for Japanese translation. 
So, I asked the business partner to give Tidy a spin becuase it looks like it would catch and correct the majority of the problems our checking tool finds. 
Attached is their findings. 
It's possible they missed something in the instructions or release notes because it does seem to have missed things it should have fixed. 
I am interested in your reaction, in particular, which of the errors can it not fix? 
Thanks, Barry Meehan Internet: bmeehan@us.ibm.com 
Barry, I downloaded and tested the Tidy tool on five HTML files. 
The results are not impressive: very few errors are fixed and even one file was totally empty after cleaning. 
The test consisted of opening the file and run the HTML Tidy "Clean, correct, convert and format" function. 
I did not try to customize the cleaning. 
I did not find yet how to remove the comments. 
I attached hereafter the data (check tool output) before and after cleaning. 
BEFORE CLEANING: Checker Output: AFTER CLEANING: Checker Output: After.txt) 
The maintenance of HTML Tidy has moved to latest version which fixes a number of bugs. 
You are invited to submit change requests and details of problems you have found. 
Note that Tidy doesn't produce an output file when it comes across severe errors requiring human attention. 
Examples of this are missing trailing quotes in attribute values, and missing closing " " for tags. 
Barry may well find what he wants if he looks at the configuration options. 
Tidy works by applying rules to build a clean parse tree which it then pretty prints provided there are no severe errors.

I'd love to download the source to do that, but the source I find on http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy says it was last updated in may of 2001 and appears to be a version older than I have - from Aug 4, 2000. 
Any idea when a source code release will be forthcoming?

Even if explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should be construed as representing my employer's opinions. 
- - That's because you are downloading the wrong thing grin . 
What you downloaded IS the 04 Aug 00 source code - it was made available on SourceForge when the Tidy project moved to SourceForge in May of 2001, as an archive for those people who wished to have that version (I'm amazed at the number of people who download the files from the Tidy project without apparently realizing what they have downloaded - each file has its own description that can be displayed without downloading the file - I mean, one file has been downloaded about 75 times in the past month, and it is plainly labelled Documentation Template, so it is not a lot of use to most people grin ). 
Currently the only way to get the current source is to check it out from CVS. Instructions for doing so can be found at If you prefer, there are pre-built binaries for popular platforms, based on near the current code, on http://tidy.sourceforge.net . 
We are currently trying to finish up some documentation, and other loose ends. 
With only a couple of us working on it part time, it is taking longer than we hoped. 
If you want to pitch in and help, that would be appreciated grin . 
Hope this helps. 
Regards, Terry I am told any day now. 
Contact the project administrators for more details.
