One more update: I marked all the editorial issues for which we are on the hook to send a meaningful closing text to xmlp-comments. 
Visually they should show up as orange. 
Marc and I committed us to send these comments before Sep 25. 
Henrik Thank you! 
Just reading Carine's email now; have you also adjusted the edlist accordingly? 
Jean-Jacques. 
During last F2F, editors took actions items that now seem disconnected from the related issues. 
- the first one was "make the proposed change wrt issue 192 resolution" As issue 192 was already closed, it looks strange. 
When i searched in the F2F IRC log, i found the following issue discussion: proposal : stick it in the Upgrade namespace anish: for consistency, why have it lowercase? 
original reason was to have it different from the main one proposal to close 291 is uppercase E in Env, and be it part of upgrade namespace issue close by this proposal ACTION: Editors, make the proposed change wrt issue 192 resolution ACTION: DavidF to send email to xmlp-comments to close 291 Therefore, i think this was a typo and the AI should be read: "ACTION: Editors, make the proposed change wrt issue 291 resolution" - the second one is "Make changes as in the proposal (none) - " According to the F2F IRC log, it must be about issue 323. 
The log says: "Editors: Issue 323 -- Make the change as in the proposal (the .../none URI)" which is close to the AI text we have now. 
(And it can't be about issue 322 because it was "Editors Change the spec per Henrik's proposed text for issue 322 (and track possible consequences) " in the AI list. 
Carine Bournez -+- W3C / INRIA Sophia-Antipolis Just did: For 192, I just closed it again. 
Both 322 and 323 have been resolved so we should be in good shape there Henrik
