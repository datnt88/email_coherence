<s> The new WAI Glossary has many nice features (however unfinished)!  </s>
<s> Have incorporated the new glossary words from UAAG 1.0 new Draft[WD-UAAG10-20010409].  </s>
<s> All documents are xhtml.  </s>
<s> Using the WAI Resources style sheet, to coordinate with........WAI Resources............go figure......  </s>
<s> For now we will be working on Glossary.  </s>
<s> This page has all of the definitions together while we are trying to figure out what to do with them.  </s>
<s> (Everything is all on one page and VERY slow) In the future our links to the WAI Glossary will actually go to loading page, that has a top link to the Printable Glossary, for those who so desire.  </s>
<s> Separately, but linked from the WAI Glossary Home page are: WAI Abbreviations http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/abbr.html WAI References http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/refer.html (That is refer, not "reefer") and many pages by one or two letters of the Alphabet Only the definitions that start with "A", are on the WAI Glossary Home page http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/Overview.html , for neatness.  </s>
<s> As you can see, all of these Docs live in a new WAI directory on CVS and Jigedit, named surprisingly, Glossary.  </s>

<s> I don't know if this has already been worried to death but... If the glossary has "acronym" in it (which includes "abbreviation" in its definition), it should have "abbreviation" in it - particularly since it's the basis for a tag of some sort?  </s>

<s> Hi all, Katie, you have made a magnificent work with the page of the glossary.  </s>
<s> Except as for the abbreviations and the acronyms, and I know that all you will hate me but I have to insist in it.  </s>
<s> As William has said, in the page that the abbreviated forms are picked up they should appear correctly marked as much the abbreviations as the acronyms (It would also be necessary to make it in all the pages of the WAI).  </s>
<s> I have edited a document that explains the difference among some and other, to help to the developers to mark the documents appropiately.  </s>
<s> The document analyzes the rules that make reference to these two elements and the behavior of diverse user applications in front of them, explains what they are, and how to differentiate them to be able to use them correctly.  </s>
<s> Also, suggests some technology to develop to facilitate their use and understanding.  </s>
<s> As the terms abbreviation and acronym they have the same origin, so much in English as in Spanish, I believe that the document can be useful also for you.  </s>
<s> To edit that document I appealed to the collaboration of screen readers' users and the Real Spanish Academy of the Language (The maximum authority on the use of the language).  </s>
<s> The document is in Spanish (naturally) but has a connection to a service of automatic translation.  </s>
<s> This service doesn't translate the end of the document in which one gives a hint to differentiate the abbreviations of the acr?nyms easily: "Abbreviation: does Not read themselves the word that is created with the form shortened, his meaning is translated, for example, when we find "etc."  </s>

<s> Acronym: the word he reads Himself that he is created with the form shortened or well the acronyms that compose it, just as is written, for example, "FBI" is not pronunciable, we read each one of the acronyms that they compose the form shortened, we read it as "Efe - be - i" and, "ONU", if is pronunciable, we read it as "onu"."  </s>
