aloha, gregg! 
while i'm not sure that, in this instance, a one-sentence distillation of my 2 sentence proposal would be any clearer, and since--as you all too well know--terseness isn't exactly my strong suit, i may not be the right person to ask to whittle my proposal down, but here goes anyway... submitted for your (collective approval) are 2 re-iterations of my original proposal, which i have also included here, marked as PROPOSED1: Define the natural language of each document. 
Indicate changes in the natural language declared for a document using appropriate markup. 
Using appropriate markup, define the natural language of each 
document, indicating any changes. 
Define the natural language of each document, and indicate any changes within the document, using appropriate markup. 
personally, if i had to choose, i'd choose PROPOSED2 -- the more i re-listen 
to it, the more it allays my initial reluctance about combination of the 2 requirements into a single statment, especially as i don't think you have to be a loose constructionist to read PROPOSED2 as extending to the indication of changes in natural language as a result of user activity, such as, say, following a link whose target resource has been referentially marked, using an 'hreflang'-type mechanism, as being encoded in a different natural language...

How about 
"Using appropriate markup, identify the natural language of content". 
It is not clear, in a world of pluggable and customised web pages, what is "the document" anyway. 
So the technique relevant is to identify the main language of a piece of content, and if there are parts of it in another language or languages to identify those individually.

Yeh, I like the idea of "content" instead of "document". 
I would just change 
that one word. 
This would continue to cover both of the older, WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.................. "Using appropriate markup, identify the natural language of content, indicating any changes". 
or ".......,indicating changes as they occur."

I've added the following to the draft: the natural language of content. 
/dt dd Since a document is made up of several pieces of content, if the language differs between pieces, they should each be marked up.

Hmmmm. Interesting. 
But I like the other wording that was proposed 
(Gregory's and Katie's). 
I don't think that one would consider a two word phrase in French as being another piece of content. 
And I don't think you should have to re-label the text that follows (where it returns to English) as being English. 
I would vote that we go with Gregory's last version.

I don't see that this scenario changes for Gregory's version, where you have to label changes. 
Per esempio if someone uses fancy terms in a foreign language, and marks them up, they can easily enough be auto-translated (and are likely to be amenable to such) for easier comprehension. 
Unfortunately in the guidelines context I don't think there is a level of content where it doesn't matter if people can't use it. 
(In some implementations a decision like this may be taken, but that is outside our scope).

Sorry, you misunderstood. 
I wasn't suggesting that any text NOT be marked. 
Gregory's version asks that all changes be marked no matter how small. 
But the wording sounds like "mark the content --- and mark any changes from that". 
Which is what I think we want. 
The version Wendy proposed sounds like. 
"mark each block of content with the appropriate language" which sounds like you would mark English at the beginning of a page and then say "End English" just before the two words of French. 
Then mark the French as start and stop. 
Then mark the following English as start English (unless you nested the language tags). 
This is not of course what is intended so I thought Gregory's text sounded better because it sounded more like what was actually done.

Greg, Consider: 
Identify the natural language of each document and mark up any changes.
