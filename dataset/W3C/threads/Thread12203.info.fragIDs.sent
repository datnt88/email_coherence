Hi folks, it looks like we will be going ahead with it. 
However there is a possiblity that it will be one day instead of two - leaving people more time to talk to other working groups and work out how to expand the range of our techniques. 
Would that cause a problem for any of the people planning to attend?

I think one day'll be OK for me ... Liddy 
By the way it would almost certainly be the monday.
