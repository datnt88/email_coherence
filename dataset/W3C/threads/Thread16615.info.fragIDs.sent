<s> I love this but after searching valiently all over, cannot find a way to force change this, as in shift refresh I've changed the pussy gif a little and wanted to check it out... Plenty say this is very hard to do, I've cleared favourites, temporary internet files, history, any one got any ideas.  </s>
<s> This seems a strange aspect, once youve labelled your site your stuck with it.  </s>

<s> The only way I know to update the image is to delete the favorite; then save the favorite again.  </s>
<s> After you close and reopen the browser, the new image should be displayed.  </s>
<s> You might be able to get by with just saving the favorite again, but I can't remember for sure whether that works.  </s>
<s> Good luck, Dan Cathers  </s>
<s> If you're still having trouble dump your browser cache and history, after deleting the favorite.  </s>
<s> Then save the link as a favorite again and the icon should show up.  </s>
<s> For other information you might try going to the following site: http://www.favicon.com/  </s>

<s> Maybe there is something wrong with your installation of IE.  </s>
<s> We have 1200 users in the agency I work for and there have been numerous times when the browser behavior was unexplainable.  </s>
<s> In these strange cases, once we reinstalled the browser, things worked properly.  </s>
<s> I know that I personally lost all my icons once when clearing out history and all I did to get them to return was save the favorite again.  </s>
