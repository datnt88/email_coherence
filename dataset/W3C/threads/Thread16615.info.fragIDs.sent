I love this but after searching valiently all over, cannot find a way to force change this, as in shift refresh I've changed the pussy gif a little and wanted to check it out... Plenty say this is very hard to do, I've cleared favourites, temporary internet files, history, any one got any ideas. 
This seems a strange aspect, once youve labelled your site your stuck with it. 
i cannot imagine anyone else being bothered to try this hard to make sure they have the latest icon in favourites.

The only way I know to update the image is to delete the favorite; then save the favorite again. 
After you close and reopen the browser, the new image should be displayed. 
You might be able to get by with just saving the favorite again, but I can't remember for sure whether that works. 
Good luck, Dan Cathers 
If you're still having trouble dump your browser cache and history, after deleting the favorite. 
Then save the link as a favorite again and the icon should show up. 
For other information you might try going to the following site: http://www.favicon.com/

This just does not seem very well thought out. 
Obviously no one else would go to this trouble.

Maybe there is something wrong with your installation of IE. 
We have 1200 users in the agency I work for and there have been numerous times when the browser behavior was unexplainable. 
In these strange cases, once we reinstalled the browser, things worked properly. 
I know that I personally lost all my icons once when clearing out history and all I did to get them to return was save the favorite again. 
It could be that you are doing the right thing and the browser is not!

It may be all a cultural issue, but the specific choice of language here keeps introducing a cognitive barrier to _my_ comprehension of your message, jonathan. 
Maybe "cat" would be a better word to use.

you may be right Kynn. 
I keep wondering what action would be taken if Dan's! message had been image based. 
Paul points out touch is a sense that doesn't feel the same in words. 
WAI and w3c really needs to reconsider the meaning of accessibility. 
It is important to provide alternatives, and the guidelines are beginning to say this. 
However for the present, the site manifestly fails to walk the talk.
