I have had some feedback on the AUS Accessibility Standards for Web Design (guidelines for accessibility for Australian Govt websites), in regards to fine-tuning some of the Standards. 
However, I am not certain as to the accuracy of some of these recommendations, therefore, I was hopeful for some expert feedback. 
(1) Do the Height and Width attributes in image tags alter page load time, or do they simply load text first? 
(2) Is it the case that the vast majority of web clients wrap ALT text? 
(3) Is it fair to describe the latest version of Lynx as frames capable? 
(4) Finally, does validation also serve the purpose of making a site accessible? 
Your views would be most welcome Regards Robert Savellis Robert Savellis: Web Project Manager Attorney General's Department Office: (02) 9228-8327 or 9228-7986 Mobile: 014-030-007 The issue is with formatting. 
You have to load some text first, in order to get the IMG SRC that are included. 
But since you don't want to relayout the text after each images, it's better to know the size of the image in advance (so you reserve the space and move forward in the text stream). 
So yes, putting image size is valuable. 
Note that this can also be done using CSS. 
I don't really know for sure. 
Netscape 3.0 doesn't. 
Don't know. 
What kind of validation ? 
just HTML ? 
I think that Hiram's explanation of point (1) is helpful. 
The person viewing the page gets better incremental-loading performance if the sizes are given.

Not directly related to accessibility, but it also goes a long way toward assuring that the page looks correct regardless of the browser used. 
It ensures you aren't relying on error recovery which exists in your favorite browser but may not exist in a newer version of that same browser or a different browser. 
I'm not sure if you were looking for comments on anything other than the last two, but... Yes, depending upon the browser, different results may be achieved without these attributes. 
In my experience, Netscape will not render text below (or beside) images for which it has no size until it loads enough of the image to get the size of the image itself. 
It will then render down to the next image. 
Internet Explorer renders the entire text of the page leaving small default sizes for the images. 
When it begins loading the image and figures out its size, it then RE-renders the text and other images as necessary (possibly resulting in MANY redraws). 
With both browsers, if you specify proper HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes, the entire text of the page will be rendered with the correct size for each image. 
When those images are loaded, they will already have a space set aside for them. 
To get a perfect example, create a page with 20 or 30 small icons (all different) on a single line (bigger file sizes for the icons will help). 
If you don't put proper attributes on these, you probably won't see ANYTHING until the last image or 2 has begun loading (depends on the browser settings for the number of simultaneous connections). 
If you put the attributes in, the page will at least appear and show each icon as it loads. 
Your mileage may vary depending on the browser, but in all cases, the attributes do speed up the time before the page is actually usable. 
I haven't given any thought to this, but I assume that this would be the case unless nbsp's are included in the ALT text.

| ----- End of forwarded message from Hiram Lester, Jr. ----- (3) Is it fair to describe the latest version of Lynx as frames capable? 
It is at least fair to say it is frames-copable. 
Lynx now presents the contents of frames much as if they were separate HTML documents. 
With a little care for the naming of the frames, this can be quite usable. 
Al Gilman ALT text? 
Internet Explorer 3.0 will automatically expand a image box to include all the ALT text, wrapping it around if it would be wider than the screen width. 
This is regardless of the HEIGHT=/WIDTH= parameters. 
It is done in response to the SPI_SCREENREADER flag that Windows supports. 
So, if a screen reader is present, we make sure all the ALT text is visible on the screen.

How about users who don't have screen readers but want the alt text?? Can it be set to do this without a screen reader? 
Is there a way to set the flag without a screen reader? 
I thought I remembered something about this from an earlier conversation but I remember it as indefinite. 
Current status?

The ALT is displayed normally if the screen reader flag is not set. 
The only difference when the flag is set is that the HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes are ignored. 
This allows ALT that are contained within small images to display the entire ALT text. 
This forces a reformatting of page, usually not what the author intended. 
The screen reader flag is the only get to get IE to ignore the author specified formatting of the page. 
At present, there is no user interface to set the screen reader flag, but it would be trivial to write a applet that did. 
Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Active Accessibility, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!" Thanks Chuck, Let me know if you do ever create such an applet, control panel or application. 
I have heard several requests already.
