<s> Both the Formal Semantics and the internal XQuery specification seem to allow empty text nodes, but this conflicts with the Data Model: 6.7 Text Nodes 6.7.1 Overview Text nodes must satisfy the following constraint: 1.  </s>
<s> A text node must not contain the empty string as its content.  </s>
<s> The formal semantics uses empty text nodes so it can suppress spaces between adjacent enclosed expressions: 4.7.1 Direct Element Constructors Normalization [ElementContent1 ..., ElementContentn]ElementContent-unit, n  1 fs:item-sequence-to-node-sequence([ ElementContent1 ]ElementContent , text { "" }, ..., text { "" }, [ ElementContentn]ElementContent 4.7.1.1 Attributes Normalization [ AttributeValueContent1 ..., AttributeValueContentn]AttributeContent-unit, n  1 fs:item-sequence-to-untypedAtomic( [AttributeValueContent1]]AttributeContent , text { "" }, ..., text {""}, [ AttributeValueContentn]AttributeContent Note also that the rule for Dynamic Evaluation of Text Node Constructors does not check for an empty string.  </s>
<s> Only the static typing consider this by returning 'text?'.  </s>
<s> Also, the informal XQuery specification has a problem here: 3.7.3.4  </s>
<s> Text Node Constructors 2. If the result of atomization is an empty sequence, no text node is constructed.  </s>
<s> ... However, it says nothing about a content expression that consists of a single empty string.  </s>
<s> I suggest removing the above sentence, and modifying the 3rd rule: 3. The individual strings resulting from the previous step are merged into a single string by concatenating them with a single space character between each pair.  </s>
<s> If the resulting string is the empty string, no text node is constructed (and the expressions returns an empty sequence).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, the resulting string becomes the content of the constructed text node.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, change the data model to allow empty text nodes.  </s>
<s> I don't see any particular reason to prohibit them, even if they're not in the XML infoset.  </s>
<s> Just replace the sentence "In addition, document and element nodes impose the constraint that two consecutive text nodes can never occur as adjacent siblings" by adding "nor can any of their text node children have the empty string as the content".  </s>
<s> My recommendation: 1. Change the Data Model to allow empty text nodes.  </s>
<s> 2. Change the Text Node Constructor to allow empty string content.  </s>
<s> 3. Change element and ocument constructor normalization so that they remove empty text nodes *and* combine adjacent text nodes.  </s>
