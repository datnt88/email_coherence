<s> That seems pretty clear about what should be in the abstract syntax (i.e. " 3 " is NOT an integer lexical form.  </s>
<s> But it still seems to beg a question about interpretation of the RDF/XML ... Michael suggests that if whitespace normalization is required/allowed, we have to say so explicitly, but doing so would seem to embed aspects of XML schema datatypes into the purely syntactic handling of RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> My inclination is say that the denotation of datatyped literals with lexical forms not valid for the datatype is unconstrained (but that there must be *some* denotation for a given interpretation).  </s>
<s> This means that: entails: is not defined by the RDF specification, but that self-entailment: entails: always holds.  </s>
<s> This leaves wiggle-room for systems that apply whitespace facet normalization of lexical forms to be permissable without imposing it on all implementations, and also allowing a minimal coherent handling (self-entailment) of unrecognized datatypes.  </s>
