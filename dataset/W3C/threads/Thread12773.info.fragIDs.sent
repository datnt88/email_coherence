I find no mention of this completed report on the WAI policy page. 
I have just downloaded it and find it important to list there. 
In our minutes Judy Brewer was to report on it. 
Did I miss it? 
Seems like that report will (if it hasn't already) become the basis for "law with teeth" to impose accessibility compliance for government procurements.

Hi Harvey, There are several things on the policy page that need updating. 
You didn't miss it, but it isn't done yet, sorry.

At I see that they reference WCAG rightly but for AU and UA, they just point to http://www.w3.org/TR (in 5.3.3.2 and 5.3.3.3) 
Isn't the case that we already have stable URL for both, i.e that we will still valid when the guidelines come out. 
Should we ask them to fix their document ?
