I've sent separate notes on issues related to the Collections Protocol that could not be resolved at Redmond. 
This note lists the proposed changes to the protocol that I believe had consensus among the group that was present. 
Unless I hear protests from the mailing list, I propose to make these changes: 1. 
The method for creating new references will be renamed to MKREF. 
The request-URI for this method will be the URI of the new reference to be created. 
The Referential-Member header will therefore be removed from the protocol. 
MKREF will behave like PUT: if a resource already exists at the request-URI, its content and headers will be overwritten. 
The issue of what happens to DAV properties breaks new ground. 
Live properties will get the properties the server deems appropriate, and dead properties will keep their original values. 
The protocol specification will state that MKREF MUST have Content-Length = 0, and the server MUST ignore any content sent with the request. 
2. URIs in all headers will be changed to coded URIs. 3. All dependencies on the Mandatory Extensions draft will be removed. 
4. The specification will be changed to say that servers MUST not follow references into collections. 
5. The DAV:reftarget property stays the same on a COPY or MOVE unless the Ref-Target header is used to change it. 
6. DAV:reftarget is a read-only property. 
It can only be set using the Ref-Target header on a MKREF, COPY, or MOVE request. 
7. The specification will not include strong references for now. 
The Ref-Integrity header and DAV:refintegrity property will be defined, but the only value defined for them will be "weak". 
This will allow extension to support strong references later. 
The DAV:refsource property, which gets used only for strong references, will be removed. 
8. 
There will be no DAV:ordering property defined by the protocol specification. 
Methods will be used to set the position of a collection member in the collection ordering. 
When a new member is added to a collection using MKREF, PUT, COPY, or MOVE, its position in the ordering can be set with the Position header. 
At later times, its position can be modified with MOVE and the Position header (It needs to be confirmed that this makes sense. 
If not, a new method will be added for modifying a member's position in the ordering). 
9. DAV:orderingtype, which is currently an element of the DAV:ordering property, will become an independent property that can be directly accessed and set by clients. 
10. 
The current specification contains no explicit way to request that a collection be ordered. 
It was agreed that an Ordered header will be defined for use with MKCOL. 
Its value will be the DAV:orderingtype of the ordering. 
There will be one value of DAV:orderingtype defined in the specification, "Arbitrary." 
This is the default value if the header is not present, and means that the client cannot depend on repeatability of the ordering of results from PROPFIND. 
That is, on compliant servers, all collections MUST have a DAV:orderingtype property, whose value may be "Arbitrary" or any client-defined ordering type. 
A client may change the value of DAV:orderingtype after creating the collection, but is then responsible for updating the ordering.

Xerox Corporation Mail Stop 105-50C 800 Phillips Road Webster, NY 14580 Be careful in stating this requirement. 
Either the MKREF method is not allowed to have a message-body (in which case Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding MUST NOT be given) or you want to preserve that as a future option (in which case the requirement should be that any message-body MAY be ignored). 
There should be no restriction on the value of Content-Length. 
This is something I fixed in the v11-rev-03 definition of OPTIONS, since specifying a specific value for Content-Length is both inadequate and overly specific for saying use of the message-body is not defined. 
....Roy Thanks. 
I think the intent is that MKREF cannot have a message body.
