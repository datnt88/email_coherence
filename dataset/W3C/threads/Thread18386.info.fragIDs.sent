Editorial notation I use: [comment] XomitX _insert_ CP #.# =checkpoint CP #.# # ordered list item thereunder CP #.# b unordered list item thereunder [General comment 1: suggest you consistently use close punctuation, typically "." on each list item.] [General comment 2: "Ask the developer if they support this functionality." 
Often the reviewer can determine these. 
The developer may be able to identify any qualifications on support. 
If the reviewer has prejudged "yes", the developer is unlikely to identify any qualifications to that support. 
But I had hoped this document would build reviewer confidence, so that developer needn't be the sole source for answers.] 
[General comment 3: Links to Checkpoints are broken.]

"This document is designed to help XpeopleX perform _an_ implementation reviewXsX of _a_ user agent technolog_y_XiesX. 
For each _User Agent Accessibility Guideline (_UAAG_)_ checkpoint_,_ information is provided on how to XevelauteX_evaluate_ the user agent for the checkpoint requirements and the markup for Xspecific specificationsX _each of the _ guidelines that should be implemented and available through the user interface. 
An evaluation by or in cooperation with a developer greatly facilitates an evaluation and for some UAAG requirements is necessary.

What is your criteria for recognizing conditional content? 
It is inadequate to assert that any attribute default of #IMPLIED has meaning only when some value for that attribute name is present. 
By default, a UA can make a choice should some attribute name be missing in a tag. 
Why is ACRONYM element conditional, but not ABBR? 
In neither case must the tag be present. 
[How does the UA respond to presence of both SCRIPT and its alternative NOSCRIPT; or FRAME and its alternative NOFRAME CP 2.4 2. If there is no specific markup (i.e. scripting of a non-specific markup) to time user interaction, the user agent does [What?] 
CP 6.6 "Conventional keyboard APIs" [Who sets the convention?] 
Regards/Harvey 
These additional events are not conditional on any user interface (although reset/select/submit don't work if the user agent can't meet the requirement to make all functionality available through the keyboard) so need not be checked specifically.
