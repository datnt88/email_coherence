<s> Everything all jostled together, pixel-to-pixel, crammed into that one tiny space called the browser with no breathing room.  </s>
<s> I'm not talking about the exponentially exploding number of web sites but rather the increasing amount of sheer stuff that keeps appearing on an already jam-packed site near you.  </s>
<s> Elaborate plug-ins like Quicktime and Shockwave, flash animations and java applets, not to mention ad banners and plain ol' animated gifs.  </s>
<s> It seems like only yesterday that BLINK was the only kid on the block.  </s>
<s> What we need is some breathing room, a bit of zen-style emptiness, in short a little more space.  </s>
<s> The print industry refers to places on a given page lacking either text or images as "white space" because in print the background is almost invariably white.  </s>
<s> Good judicious use of white space is one of key elements of print design.  </s>
<s> On the web empty space doesn't necessarily need to be white but it is still an important aspect of good design and should be visible.  </s>
<s> Or not visible.  </s>
<s> Depending on how you want to (not) look at it.  </s>
<s> White space is important because it allows the eye to be guided along a page in a fluid seamless manner.  </s>
<s> Without white space the viewer is confronted with an enslaught of options all appearing equal and overwhelming.  </s>
<s> Too many images, too much color, too many fonts or just simply too much text will confuse and aggravate your visitors, more readily enticing them to close the browser window rather than to click further into your site.  </s>
<s> There are quite a number of layout tricks you can use to add clean appealing open spaces to your web site and the simplest of them all starts with the non-breaking space, otherwise known as &amp;nbsp; or &amp;#160;.  </s>
<s> A whole group of non-breaking spaces functions like a small block of emptiness.  </s>
<s> You can put five of them together at the front of a paragraph to make indents or use groups of them to push images and words father apart from one another.  </s>
<s> You've probably seen the non-breaking space at work in w i d e l y s p a c e d w o r d s where a &amp;nbsp; is placed between each letter to add roomy variety to headlines and titles.  </s>
<s> Along with spacing your words and letters horizontally you might also decide to add some vertical distance between them in order to help delineate sections, title headings or just break up large potentially monotonous blocks of text.  </s>
<s> You can give your text a break with the BR tag (BR stands for BReak, get it?).  </s>
<s> The BR tag adds a single empty line wherever it goes.  </s>
<s> So to push standard paragraphs farther apart from each other simply put a BR in between each one.  </s>
<s> Another trick is to wrap a font tag around a BR tag which effectively resizes the Break to be larger or smaller according to your specified FONT tag SIZE attribute.  </s>
<s> This trick is not strictly speaking proper HTML and may not work on all older browsers but is fine for the 4.x and up majority.  </s>
<s> Even a lot of nicely spaced paragraphs can look funny if their individual lines are too long so it's important to strike a balance between width and height by adjusting your horizontal margins to keep up.  </s>
<s> The BLOCKQUOTE feature gives you a quick and dirty way to pad paragraphs with wider left and right margins.  </s>
<s> This tag has been around forever and most browsers will indent both sides but some choose only to indent on the left.  </s>
<s> Of course these days the most popular way to control both horizontal and vertical margins is through tables.  </s>
<s> Tables were not intended to be used as a layout tool but with the release of HTML 3.2 in 1996 designers far and wide jumped at the chance to layout their text more precisely when finally given a tool to abuse.  </s>
<s> While this kind of layout need is exactly what Cascading Style Sheets are meant to fill, Tables still provide a decent means of separating sections of text despite the fact that it was not their original intent to be used in such a manner.  </s>
<s> (I don't want to run through a whole table tutorial right now so if you can't understand the following you might want to run through Webmonkey's Basic Tables Tutorial at Putting your text into a table cell surrounded by empty cells on either side is an obvious way to set margins on the fly.  </s>
<s> For example: Points of interest in the above example: Set the table border to zero or else you won't have the invisible margin effect so much as you'll have a "look I'm formatting with tables" effect.  </s>
<s> The second thing to note is that some browsers have difficulty with empty cells so since you want the cell to look empty without actually being empty the ideal candidate for the job is our new sneaky friend the non-breaking space.  </s>
<s> The last trick for inserting empty space is in some ways the most precise.  </s>
<s> The infamous 1-pixel gif.  </s>
<s> The beauty of this method is that you can insert exactly as much nothingness as you want, one pixel at a time, simply by setting the tiny graphic's IMG tag HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to exactly what you want.  </s>
<s> Because the gif is a scant 43 bytes (that's .04  </s>
<s> K) it takes no time to download itself into your visitors' browser cache and can be used as many times as you'd like.  </s>
<s> A slightly less precise method but one that works in an even more behind-the-scenes manner is to set the HSPACE and VSPACE attibutes of the 1-pixel IMG .  </s>
<s> Sizing the invisible graphic this way prevents the loading-graphic-square from appearing on those truly slow server days.  </s>
<s> Many browsers show a "outline" of images before they're fully loaded.  </s>
<s> If your image has been sized to be 200 pixels wide visitors will probably notice such a square whereas a 1 pixel image with a 199 pixel HSPACE border will likely slink by unseen.  </s>
<s> The HSPACE/VSPACE attribute is far less consistent cross-platform but the choice is yours.  </s>
<s> If you're not up to creating your own invisible gif you can copy one courtesy of web design guru Dmitry Kirsanov at page you won't see anything--which is after all the whole point- -so don't panic, just choose Save from your File menu and you'll download the image to your local drive.)  </s>
<s> Well I know I've made it through this whole article without once giving in but I honestly don't think I can end this without succumbing to the temptation so I apologize in advance but it's just too much for me, it's a cliche but it's still good advice and anyway I can't resist, I have to say it, don't forget: Less Is More.  </s>

<s> Charles: I hope you can locate that article.  </s>

<s> My point was more the sheer number of people reached by the newsletter in question (it is put out by the Web Site Garage), rather than the severity of the recommendations.  </s>

<s> Charles (and anyone else), The WAI Education and Outreach Group promotes the WCAG, and also provides supplementary materials such as a quick tips card, (more of a handy reminder than anything else - 10 ideas for improving accesibility of sites, printed on a business card) and a set of tutorial slides showing how to use the guidelines.  </s>
<s> I agree that the level of awareness in "Experts" is lower than desirable, especially given the fact that many of the requirements of accessible design are also simple requirements of good quality design.  </s>
<s> In terms of what you can do beyond personal email I would suggest you get involved in the Education and Outreach group.  </s>
<s> Other helpful things include finding (or making) sites which do comply, to demonstrate how it isn't really difficult in most cases.  </s>
<s> If I locate the article I mentioned online I will definitely post the address.  </s>
