<s> For each checklist there will be a list of links to the relevant items in the technology-specific documents (similar to WCAG1), but we can also include the non-technology specific techniques.  </s>
<s> Someone could use this document to see all the different ways that a checklist item has been satisfied.  </s>
<s> Like other techniques documents, it would not be normative.  </s>
