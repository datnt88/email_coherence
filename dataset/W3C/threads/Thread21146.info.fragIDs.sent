The GL version of 7.2 is not running on XP. 
Its process appears for a brief millisecond and immediately disappears. 
I tried turning off XP-style toolbars as well.

Hi folks who have trouble with the windows 32 bits version. 
The problem comes from the double dot used in the name of the software (.2.exe) For my part i had the ability to add the .2.exe as a binary extension inside an external download manager and i am running Amaya 7.2 on Windows XP very well. 
Irene : please remember for the next version not to include a double dot :-)

On Tue, 4 Feb 2003 01:32:16 +0100 The problem with the GL version on XP was due to missing files in initial Windows distributions. 
Of course it worked for people that have the previous version still installed. 
Since the beginning of our distributions nobody else reported a problem with several dots within our distribution file names. 
It's not a problem for us to change that, but are you sure we need to change? 
Irene.

Dear Irene, I had this trouble with my own dowload but if nobody else had problem with this there is no reason to change. 
Perhaps was it only a trouble with my download manager because i had to set the double dot as a binary.
