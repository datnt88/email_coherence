The XML Schema group would prefer us to use the term "lexical mapping" instead of "datatype mapping". 
I see no reason why not, and so PROPOSE that we accept xmlsch-03 and action all the editors to look for the term "datatype mapping" and replace it with "lexical mapping". 
We agree that it is useful to define a term to denote such mappings; in the interests of inter-specification consistency, we wonder whether you would be willing to consider using the term lexical mapping, which we are introducing in our forthcoming draft of XML Schema 1.1. 
The term datatype mapping seems unlikely to be usable in the XML Schema specification, where it would suggest to some readers a mapping from one datatype to another, rather than as here a mapping from lexical space to value space. 
(XML Schema 1.0 got by without a term for this concept.) 
Two reasons we might have for not accepting are: 1) it may be quite a large editorial change in terms of number of bytes 2) if we decide that our whitespace treatment is sufficiently different from XML Schema's that we should use a different term Jeremy In Semantics I always refer to this as 'lexical-to-value mapping' . 
Anyone want me to change this to 'lexical mapping'? 
The longer form is readable (just) and harder to misunderstand, seems to me. 
BTW, I have also now introduced the term 'datatype map' to refer to the D's in D-intepretations, since they are now mappings from urirefs to datatypes (sets of pairs) rather than simply sets of datatypes (to handle the 'naming' issue properly). 
So this is yet another source of potential confusion with the 'datatype mapping' term. 
I could change that 'datatype map' terminology if people feel strongly about it, by the way. 
Any other suggestions for what to call a mapping from urirefs to datatypes? 
A datatype scheme? 
A datatype naming scheme? 
A naming of datatypes?

See below. 
I like "lexical-to-value mapping" myself. 
It seem to me leaving one end of the mapping out is asking for trouble, unless you are very firmly in context. 
I myself would have tended to interpret "lexical mapping" as a mapping TO lexical, rather than a mapping FROM lexical (and would have thought a more natural name for this would have been "value mapping", if you had to name only one end). 
I like "datatype naming scheme" myself. 
It certainly makes it clear that URIrefs are (here) being used as names for datatypes. 
--Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Well, yes, but is this really a "naming scheme" specific to datatypes? 
Seems like it's just the generic URI to resource denotation/mapping and the only thing relating to datatyping is that the resources in question happen to all be datatypes. 
I wouldn't want to see a term that could easily be misunderstood to indicate something other than that basic, generic URI to resource mapping.
