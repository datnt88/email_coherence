<s> Hi. I'm doing a research on client-side caching of web documents sent over HTTPS - if (and how) web browsers respect "Cache-Control: (private)" and valid "Expires" headers sent by the server over a secure connection.  </s>
<s> I've searched the web extensively, but I've come up with very little reliable information outside the fact that "HTTPS is simply HTTP served over SSL" and some people second-guessing about browsers not caching HTTPS documents at all...  </s>
<s> Any authoriative information (or insight) would be most appreciated... ...and the development community could also benefit from this knowledge, as it seems not to be readily available out there.  </s>
<s> My problem: I am part of a team developing a web-app served over HTTPS.  </s>
<s> The application is split into several HTML frames (some with comletely static/generic content) and there are several image files that are an essential part of the design.  </s>
<s> Since bandwidth-use and server-load is a big issue for us, we'd like to cache as many of the pages/images as possible, while serving the whole application over HTTPS, as we don't want the users (many of which are one time users) confronted by dialog-windows notifying them about there being "both secure *and* insecure items on the page"... Cheers, and thanks in advance for anything you might be able to share.  </s>

<s> It will depend on what browser you use and how it's configured  </s>
<s> IE saves SSL pages in it's private cache.  </s>
<s> This is possible because every  </s>
<s> user has a different cache.  </s>
<s> But MS provides an option to disable caching of encrypted content.  </s>
<s> I guess browsers will threat encrypted content the same way as unencrypted content: doesn't matter to them.  </s>
<s> I suppose you should set up a web site the same way, whether it's send using HTTP or HTTPS.  </s>
<s> Enabling compression is also a good way to save bandwidth.  </s>
<s> There may be some complications with bad developed proxies when using HTTP (unsecured).  </s>
<s> If you enable Encryption on MS/IIS you should ensure that the content doesn't expire directly because of compression (see IIS help for more about this).  </s>
<s> Ensure you use encryption as less as possible, as it requires much processing overhead and content will only be cached by user agents.  </s>
<s> Ensure most content is cached by everbody (cache-control: public).  </s>
<s> Content that will change regarly must have expire times and preferably cached by everybody.  </s>
<s> Ensure to support reporting "Not Changed" status, which could also save a lot of bandwidth.  </s>
<s> Content that is specific to users and/or contains sensative information should be cached by the user-agent only, and optionally require revalidation (getting new content or "Not changed" status).  </s>
<s> Indeed, you can sacrafise bandwidth for user-friendlyness: entire page over secure channel or unsecured channel.  </s>
<s> I would really recommend this.  </s>
<s> Note that home-pages should not be encrypted: this is where most users will come and hopefully directly leave.  </s>
<s> Also home-pages don't include sensative information (usually).  </s>
<s> Do authentication over HTTPS, even as sending sensative content.  </s>
<s> You should not cache too much about messages about switching between secure and unsecure channels.  </s>
<s> This happens at many sites.  </s>
<s> You can, like most webmail applications, mix unsecured and secured, in an effort to save bandwidth and reduce processor utilization.  </s>
<s> Hope these suggestions will help you a little bit...  </s>

<s> Apparently this is also what Opera does: When people say that browsers don't cache HTTPS documents, it's not clear if they're talking about "permanent/extended" page cache, or temporary cache for the current session only.  </s>
<s> My semi-educated *guess* is that browsers generally cache HTTPS documents like all other documents, but then clean the HTTPS cache when the browser is closed.  </s>
<s> Does that sound likely?  </s>
<s> We're doing this already (mostly).  </s>
<s> But there remains the issue of linked static documents such as CSS files, .JPGs and .GIFs and external Javascript files.  </s>
<s> We'd like these to be stored in the browser cache for as long as possible (within the limits of "Expires:" of course) without our users having to deal with dialog boxes alerting them about "non-secure" items being loaded and asking them whether they want to load those or not...  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> I'm still searching for more answers.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions where to look/ask?  </s>
