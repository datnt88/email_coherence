<s> I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> I have been thinking about it some, and have the following preliminary observations: 1.  </s>
<s> It could only be used if you knew you were talking to a 1.2 application.  </s>
<s> 2. A 1.2 proxy talking to a 1.1 or earlier application would have to convert.  </s>
<s> 3. Signatures or hashes would have to be computed on the canonical, full name, form.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any showstoppers yet to using it in 1.2.  </s>
<s> Yes, it does -- changing existing header field names (i.e., short names or tokenizing) can only be done in HTTP/2.x. Besides, it doesn't make any sense to introduce short names now when the GOAL should be a multiplexed and tokenized grammar for HTTP/2.0, and that can be accomplished in six months if people don't waste their time on minor tweaks that are equally incompatible with 1.x.  </s>

<s> rom the Montreal minutes suggestion for a new charter's milestones:  </s>
<s> I suggest dropping this as a product of the working group.  </s>
<s> Although it is certainly possible to compress the protocol through two adjacent communicating parties by the addition of stateful interaction (what is meant by sticky headers and context identifiers) and tokenizing protocol elements (a small part of which is covered by short names for headers), it is not a trivial task and needs to be extremely careful with regard to proxy-proxy communication with requests from multiple user agents being interleaved.  </s>
<s> This falls into the category of "research" and should be investigated outside the standards arena.  </s>
<s> In other words, I don't think this task can be accomplished within the lifetime of this WG.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, even if it were accomplished, our long term (within a year) plans for HTTP would end up replacing it by the multiplexing and tokenizing of HTTP/2.x.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think it would be better to focus within the WG on things that can be done before the next IETF meeting, and encourage other efforts to focus on the research work that already needs doing for multiplexing and tokenizing of HTTP/2.x. ...Roy T.

<s> Header compression has been in TCP for quite a while, so I don't think that the topic is "research".  </s>
<s> It is true that good careful engineering will be required, but that's different that research.  </s>
<s> HTTP is not TCP.  </s>
<s> Just about everything ever planned for HTTP has been done before in something else.  </s>
<s> The research question is what happens when you add that functionality to the existing HTTP system.  </s>
<s> Does it work as intended?  </s>
<s> Does the improvement justify the added complexity?  </s>
<s> Those are research questions (and yes, careful engineering does involve research whenever the exact same thing has not been done before).  </s>
<s> I like research (obviously) -- I just don't like research in the name of standardization.  </s>
<s> Why don't you wait until the draft comes out?  </s>
<s> I promised it by the end of the month, and it is well under way.  </s>
<s> If it is so hard to do, it should be obvious at that point.  </s>
<s> A draft will also enable experimental implementations, to gauge how much improvement it might make.  </s>
<s> That does not justify a milestone on the WG charter -- we can do all that outside the committee structure.  </s>
<s> If the improvement looks good, we would be very interested in deploying such a scheme fairly quickly.  </s>
<s> You can deploy such a scheme any time you want -- you just can't call it HTTP.  </s>
<s> Note that the Upgrade header field exists for that very purpose.  </s>
<s> Once you have answered the research questions, a specification of it can start through the standards cycle, along with any other performance improvements at an equivalent level of maturity.  </s>
<s> Even if HTTP/2.x could be finished within a year, deployment will take much longer becuase of the installed base of 1.x.  </s>
<s> But HTTP/2.x seems much more like research than any 1.x enhancement under discussion.  </s>
<s> HTTP/2.0 (consisting of just HTTP/1.1 in a tokenized form and encapsulated in a multiplexed stream) can be done in six months.  </s>
<s> We already have specifications (albeit incomplete) for both, and more than one test implementation showing primary gains from multiplexing.  </s>
<s> As such, it has the exact same risk factor, cost, and implementation time as any incompatible change to the protocol.  </s>
<s> The difference is in the payoff.  </s>
<s> Even so, I would not have this WG try to standardize HTTP/2.0 -- it is still research.  </s>
<s> In fact, I would encourage any vendor to begin work on it immediately, since 99% of the effort is just enabling the internals of the application (client or server) to deal with any form of a multiplexed, persistent connection; once that is done, converting it to the final "standard" form is easy.  </s>
<s> Rapid incremental evolution, as opposed to revolution, has usually been more successful at getting technology to the user quickly.  </s>
<s> It's just part of the sociology of large distributed systems.  </s>
<s> Allow me to refresh people's memory.  </s>
<s> A group of people involved in the development of the Web met at the Chicago WWW2 conference (October 94, before this WG existed) to discuss the future of HTTP and the plan of attack for improving its security, performance, etc. Henrik and I volunteered to rewrite the HTTP specification, since it was already a year out-of-date and it was very clear that new people entering the Web project did not understand the full capabilities of the protocol, and we needed a shared understanding in order to avoid breaking its good qualities when advanced to the next generation.  </s>
<s> Simon Spero and Dave Raggett (with Andy Norman) volunteered to work on a binary version of HTTP [I can't remember if it included multiplexing at that time or not -- I do know multiplexing was present soon afterword].  </s>
<s> A few months later, we put together the HTTP BOF at San Jose which began the HTTP-WG.  </s>
<s> Small improvements in the protocol were to be done in HTTP/1.x in parallel with the large performance change in HTTPng, for precisely the reason you give: Rapid incremental evolution.  </s>
<s> The difference, however, is that evolution within the HTTP/1.x family would retain the existing message format and field names to maximize compatibility (reducing complexity of the implementations) and maintain a "safe harbor" for those unable or unwilling to sacrifice simplicity for speed.  </s>
<s> Adding persistent connections was one of those small improvements -- removing the dependence on a single transaction per TCP connection was a basic step toward supporting multi-layered proxy configurations efficiently and a better understanding of long-lived, multiplexed connections.  </s>
<s> And yet, it took over six months of prodding before we could get people to experiment with it -- before we could do the basic tests necessary to determine if it was even worthwhile adding to the proposed standard.  </s>
<s> In hindsight, I now regret that we even bothered to do that much -- it alone added over eight months to the delay in getting HTTP/1.1 finished (and, BTW, I was mighty pissed-off when the same person who insisted on it being in HTTP/1.1 later complained about how long it took to get draft 00 to the WG).  </s>
<s> Almost two years later, the performance problems of HTTP remain the same.  </s>
<s> So does the solution.  </s>
<s> The only thing that is lacking is the PEOPLE dedicated to writing a complete specification of the solution that we already know will work.  </s>
<s> This doesn't have to happen inside the WG -- it just has to happen.  </s>
<s> In the mean time, the notion that anyone can write a complete specification of something that hasn't been tried before, and then get this WG to agree that adding statefulness to an otherwise stateless protocol is a good thing, all in less than 4 months, is utterly ludicrous.  </s>
<s> Attempting to do that within this WG will only starve-out the other products of the WG, such as a real specification of content negotiation, because people like me will have to spend hours generating long-winded messages just to explain why it is the wrong way to proceed instead of doing something that would contribute toward accomplishing our other goals.  </s>

<s> There's some concern in the community that "HTTP-WG will close, what will happen to HTTP-NG".  </s>
<s> The standard answer of "Another Working Group" hasn't been all that reassuring, without there being much evidence of such.  </s>
<s> So, I'd like to strongly suggest that those who are interested in starting a HTTP-NG working group ("binary format HTTP, without MIME message headers") get together, create a charter, a list of milestones, find document editor(s) and a chair and begin NOW to lay the groundwork for starting HTTP-NG review now, if things are far enough along.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest that the charter of HTTP-NG-WG be narrowed to concern itself only with the transport issues (tokenization, multiplexing, etc.) rather than an open ended list of HTTP enhancements.  </s>
<s> Having a draft charter and a WG proposal will remove some of the myths surrounding HTTP-NG.  </s>
<s> I don't recall if there's a public HTTP-NG mailing list; creating one so that all HTTP-NG discussion can move there (rather than here on HTTP-WG) would be a good first step.  </s>
