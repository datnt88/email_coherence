I tend to agree with Jon that people will be looking for JavaScript or DHTML rather than DOM. 
Could we solve this by calling the section DOM and adding the other related non-W3C technologies in parens? 
Something like: Section 12.8 DOM (Includes JavaScript, DHTML, blah, foo, and stuff) That way a visual scan or text search for one of these technologies would get people to the right place. 
publication as a W3C note Wendy, It seems to me that JavaScript is what people would more likely be looking for accessibility information on, than a topic called the DOM. 
Jon I have included "DOM" in the list. 
--w I would like to see "JavaScript" under the added requirements in the following section: 1. Add requirements beyond HTML and CSS I know that scripting is alluded to in the following statement: "Clearly specify how content that is tailored according to client or user capabilities may conform (dynamic content or database driven)" But I think it should have its own section for some of the following reasons: 1. 
What is the "standard" or "recommended" way to support the DOM. 
Currently IE and NN support different models for access the DOM with scripting. 
2. Designing for device independence.

I am in agreement with the requirements document with the suggested changes that would include some reference to Java, etc. Thanks, David Tanner Assistive Technology Specialist MN State Services f/t Blind
