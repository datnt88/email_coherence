In section 5.5.3. 
"HTML event types", it says: load The load event occurs when the DOM implementation finishes loading all content within a document, all frames within a FRAMESET, or an image. 
Is there any reason to restrict this just to images? 
Couldn't I attach it to an object , whatever sort of thing it is?

Actually, it should state object since HTML 4.0/XHTML 1.0 have deprecated the image element in favor of the object element.

As much as I think that would be a good idea, it simply isn't true.
