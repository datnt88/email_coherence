xml-source.xml from the DOM Level 2 HTML recommendation and from the DOM L3 Validation working draft reference the previously mentioned URL which does not respond at the current time. 
Most other references to the DTD are relative and resolve to the DTD provided in the .zip 
file. 
Also, the L2 HTML xml-source.xml file declares a 'us-ascii' encoding but uses ISO latin characters such as /xA9. 
I'll compensate for these in the DOM Test suite build file, but it would be good to get the DTD available again. 
Looks ok from my side. 
Network or server problem?

This one is problematic. 
Both the XSL generator and XML validator failed to comply with the us-ascii encoding. 
I cannot change the DOM Level 2 HTML REC file unfortunately. 
Would a copy of the xml-source.xml with the appropriate encoding be helpful somewhere else on the W3C site?

Looks ok now too. 
Not necessary for the DOM TS work. 
I've already compensated in the build script. 
I just wanted to let you know in case the same issue could be prevented in the next round of DOM 3 drafts. 
I replaced the version of xalan and it fixed the problem. 
The version used was not recognizing the encoding us-ascii appropriately. 
I'll investigate the XML validator problem latter.
