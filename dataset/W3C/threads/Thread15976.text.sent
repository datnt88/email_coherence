Dear group, Can anyone refer me to a site that incorporates a well designed calendar? 
Please reply on or off the list as your conscious dictates. 
On a completely unrelated matter, I read about an amusing tag BOT ... /BOT that can be used to surround code that a web author is forced to include against his (or her) better judgement. 
BOT stands for "Boss Ordered This", but -- if asked -- it can also be explained as short for roBOT. 
Thank you, Bruce Bailey, http://www.dors.state.md.us/ 
I am sorry to report that NO ONE could respond positively to this request! 
Any grad students looking for an interesting HTML/CGI project? 
I suggest that devices designed for the blind as PIMs (the Blazie Braille 'n Speak for example) incorporate good models for calendars / day timers / appointment books -- and that they might translate well. 
I recently came across this reference from the Trace Center which discusses the issues at URL: Our local Tech Act project has a fairly decent calendar that is accessible. 
It can be found at URL: I think the problem is to create a calendar which makes sense and which conveys a month of information on inspection, rather than having to skip by days. 
The way I would do it at the moment is to put the day and date at the start of each cell.

well designed for who. 
Our site is gradually building a set of links by calendar and personal festivals. 
Our students in many cases have little comprhension of the passing of the seasons, months or weeks. 
Naturally We try to think of ways to reinforce understanding. 
I would be grateful for your suggestions jay@peepo.com
