Your CSS is correct. 
Are you sure that the implementation that you were using supports opentype fonts? 
Its sort of like images - the HTML might be correct but if the image format is not supported .... 
Well, I use Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape 4.7. 
Do you mean that these most widespreaded browsers probably don't support opentype (I also tried truetype) font embedding? 
That's very sad, because as I saw those special formats that IE and NS support are not compatible with each other. 
So actually it seems that I have to wait till MS or NS takes the trouble to make a browser that really matches the CSS specification.

Yes. 
Right. 
Where in the CSS specification does it say that support for the opentype format is required?

Well, actually under section 15.3.5 it says the following (hmmm... yes, it also says that it's just _likely_ to be used ;-) An initial list of format strings defined by this specification and representing formats likely to be used by implementations on various platforms is: String Font Format Examples of common extensions "truedoc-pfr" TrueDocT Portable Font Resource .pfr 
"embedded-opentype" Embedded OpenType .eot 
"type-1" PostScriptT Type 1 .pfb, 
.pfa 
"truetype" TrueType .ttf 
"opentype" OpenType, including TrueType Open .ttf 
"truetype-gx" TrueType with GX extensions "speedo" Speedo "intellifont" Intellifont

Those (in the absence of MIME types for fonts - we didn't have five years to devote to fighting for *those* ) are format strings - ways to indicate what font type is available at a given URL. 
It doesn't mean that a conforming implementation must implement the listed eight formats. 
Instead, it provides a way for stylesheet authors to indicate what fornt formats they are making available for download. 
It avoids having to download a font only to find that its a format that can't be used. 
Likely to be used on various platforms, as it says. 
Remember that printers etc are also targets for stylesheets.
