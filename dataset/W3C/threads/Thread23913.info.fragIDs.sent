<s> Your CSS is correct.  </s>
<s> Are you sure that the implementation that you were using supports opentype fonts?  </s>
<s> Its sort of like images - the HTML might be correct but if the image format is not supported ....  </s>
<s> Well, I use Internet Explorer 5.0 and Netscape 4.7.  </s>
<s> Do you mean that these most widespreaded browsers probably don't support opentype (I also tried truetype) font embedding?  </s>
<s> That's very sad, because as I saw those special formats that IE and NS support are not compatible with each other.  </s>
<s> So actually it seems that I have to wait till MS or NS takes the trouble to make a browser that really matches the CSS specification.  </s>

<s> Well, actually under section 15.3.5 it says the following (hmmm... yes, it also says that it's just _likely_ to be used ;-) An initial list of format strings defined by this specification and representing formats likely to be used by implementations on various platforms is: String Font Format Examples of common extensions "truedoc-pfr" TrueDocT Portable Font Resource .pfr  </s>

<s> .pfa  </s>
<s> "truetype" TrueType .ttf  </s>
<s> "opentype" OpenType, including TrueType Open .ttf  </s>
<s> "truetype-gx" TrueType with GX extensions "speedo" Speedo "intellifont" Intellifont  </s>
<s> Ash  </s>
<s> Those (in the absence of MIME types for fonts - we didn't have five years to devote to fighting for *those* ) are format strings - ways to indicate what font type is available at a given URL.  </s>
<s> It doesn't mean that a conforming implementation must implement the listed eight formats.  </s>
<s> Instead, it provides a way for stylesheet authors to indicate what fornt formats they are making available for download.  </s>
<s> It avoids having to download a font only to find that its a format that can't be used.  </s>
<s> Likely to be used on various platforms, as it says.  </s>
<s> Remember that printers etc are also targets for stylesheets.  </s>
