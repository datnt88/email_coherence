<s> In an attempt to fill in Jim's table, I have tried to expand Geoff's sketch, based on Geoff's other messages around the same time.  </s>
<s> It's useful to recall that if the VCR is checked out at the time of the PUT or PROPPATCH, the auto-version property is ignored, and there is no auto-versioning.  </s>
<s> That leaves the case when the VCR is checked-in at the time of the PUT or PROPPATCH, with the following interpretation of the value of auto-version: nothing - no auto-versioning DAV:when-locked - auto-checkout when write-locked, buffer changes until unlock request, then auto-checkin - error when unlocked (at time of PUT or PROPPATCH) DAV:when-unlocked - create new version; i.e., auto-checkout, modify, auto-checkin (must supply lock header if VCR write-locked) DAV:when-locked, DAV:when-unlocked - auto-checkout when write-locked, buffer changes until unlock request, then auto-checkin - create new version when unlocked; i.e., auto-checkout, modify, auto-checkin Note that when-unlocked does *not* mean auto-version only when the VCR is unlocked, whereas when-locked does in fact mean auto-version only when the VCR is write-locked.  </s>
<s> This inconsistency makes the naming somewhat misleading, but I haven't come up with anything better that also works in combination in the fourth case.  </s>
<s> This interpretation of when-unlocked is critical for versioning systems that require all versionable resources to be under version control, but don't support storing intermediate state on the server between checkout and checkin.  </s>
<s> Such systems cannot support the CHECKOUT option, because it requires storage of intermediate state.  </s>
<s> Nor can they support the when-locked flavor of auto-versioning, for the same reason.  </s>
<s> So they are reduced to depending on the when-unlocked flavor of auto-versioning in core versioning, with the above interpretation covering all VCRs, regardless of lock state.  </s>
