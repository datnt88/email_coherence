<s> Where distance education is provided by the web, the tools used to author content for that service are within our current scope.  </s>
<s> The tools used to pass stuff around are in some cases user agents, and therefore are in the scope of the user agent group.  </s>
<s> (examples would include soft-arc's first class client, the only one I have used much) Often these systems are in fact authoring tools and user agents combined, although generally limited in their power.  </s>
<s> There are also servers which don't have any real effect on the content.  </s>
