<s> I'm having problems with several tests that use firstChild.  </s>
<s> The tests are schema valid and no errors are thrown during transformation to java.  </s>
<s> When I compile the generated code I get errors.  </s>
<s> I've attached the xml file and the generated java code from one of the tests.  </s>
<s> All of the tests that use firstChild have compilation errors.  </s>
<s> Rick Rivello  </s>
<s> Note the line: textNode = (Node)(()testEmployee).();  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> My guess is a problem with the definition of firstChild in dom2-interfaces.xml  </s>
<s> (built from the DOM 2 sources).  </s>
<s> I can't troubleshoot this till late tonight.  </s>
<s> You might compare the entry for firstChild in dom2-interfaces.xml with that in dom1-interfaces.xml.  </s>
<s> Looks like it is trying to find the function definition and just comes up blank.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't let this stop you from committing the tests (actually, it should encourage you to commit the tests so we can work out any interactions between the tests and the transforms).  </s>
