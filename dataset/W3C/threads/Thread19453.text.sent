There is still no COLUMN (I'm not talking of a table column, but newspaper column) element in the W3C recommendations, so authors use the TABLE element to get the effect of columns. 
The W3C recommends that tables should not be used for layout purposes -- but do not practice what they preach as the W3C main page consists of tables. 
But if there is no COLUMN element, what can one do to get the effect? 
Until such time as there is a COLUMN element authors will continue to use the TABLE element. 
Style sheets and 'pseudo' columns. 
One could force columns in the following way, but none of the browsers support this fully yet. 
Theoretically the following markup should result in a column: .columnleft 
{ width: 40%; height: 300px .columnright 
{ margin-top: -300px; margin-left: 50%; width: 40%; vertical-align: text-top This can then be appleid to block elements such as DIV or P. However, Netscape totally ignores this. 
IE 4 ignores DIV and when P is used, you can see the right column box is in the proper position (if you declare a border so that you can see it), but it seems that 'width' is not recognized by IE, as the content of the right column displays below the left column and not in the top of the right 'column' box. 
So, when can we expect an HTML COLUMN element? 
Jacques Or until CSS support becomes more widespread. 
Note, BTW, that if you want to replace your layout tables, but don't want to work out how to do it in CSS, the quick and dirty solution is to replace TABLE with DIV STYLE="display:table", TR with DIV STYLE="display:table-row", and TD with DIV STYLE="display:table-cell". 
(In fact, tables and table-rows are implied if they're left out, so you only need the display:table DIV if there's more than one table in a row, and the display:table-row DIV if there's more than one row in a table. 
:-) ) That tells CSS2-aware browsers to do the layout as if there were a table there, but without abusing the TABLE structure. 
Of course, this is a new feature in CSS2, and nobody supports it yet, but the more it's used, the more incentive there'll be for browser makers to support it. 
(And since most browsers already have table display algorithms anyway, they should have little trouble supporting it.) In the meantime, your layout "tables" should have been constructed to degrade gracefully anyway.

I wouldn't consider the effect you are trying to achieve to be true columns, which to me only make sense on paged media and allow the browser to select the column break position. 
I would say the effect you are trying to achieve here should be done with two absolutely positioned divisions, possibly within a relatively positioned one. 
In my experience IE 4 understands divisions a lot better than NS 4. David Woolley - Office: David Woolley djw@bts.co.uk BTS Home: david@djwhome.demon.co.uk Wallington TQ 2887 6421 England 51 21' 44" N, 00 09' 01" W (WGS 84)
