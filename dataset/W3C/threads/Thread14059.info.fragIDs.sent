<s> PART 2: A FATAL FLAW Section 2.A.  </s>
<s> A Fatal Problem with the Rating System Essentially the current priority rating system confounds two variables, making it impossible to properly interpret the ratings.  </s>
<s> I regard this as an extremely serious ("fatal") problem.  </s>
<s> Following are explanations of the rating levels as found in the 7 December 1998 version of the page authoring guidelines.  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] This guideline must be followed by an author, or one or more groups of users will find it impossible to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline is a basic requirement for some groups to be able to use Web documents.  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 2] This guideline should be followed by an author, or one or more groups of users will find it difficult to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will significantly improve access to Web documents.  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] This guideline may be followed by an author to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will improve access to Web documents.  </s>
<s> (Source: 7 December 1998 Version of the Page Authoring Guidelines, Note that each priority has two aspects, (1) impact (2) and imperative for use.  </s>
<s> In order to clarify these two aspects, I have separated below the three "impact" levels from the three "imperative for use" levels.  </s>
<s> The "impact" aspect addresses the severity of the usability problems caused by violation of the technique.  </s>
<s> Below, I have separated this aspect.  </s>
<s> (I have also changed the document to refer to techniques instead of guidelines, since I believe that the editors are making that change.) [Impact Level 1] Violations of this technique result in one or more groups of users finding it impossible to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline is a basic requirement for some groups to be able to use Web documents.  </s>
<s> [Impact Level 2] Violations of this technique result in one or more groups of users finding it difficult to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will significantly improve access to Web documents.  </s>
<s> [Impact Level 3] Violations of this technique may result in one or more groups of users finding it somewhat difficult for one or more groups of users to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline will improve access to Web documents.  </s>
<s> [Note.  </s>
<s> I have made a minor editing change to this priority in order to make it more parallel to the first two.  </s>
<s> These minor changes are immaterial to the argument.]  </s>
<s> (Adapted by Eric Hansen from the 7 Dec 1998 page authoring guidelines.) On the other hand, the "imperative for use" aspect indicates how important it is for the page author to adhere to the technique.  </s>
<s> Below, I have separated out the "imperative for use" portion.  </s>
<s> (I have also changed the document to refer to techniques instead of guideline, since I understand priorities are being removed from guidelines.) [Imperative Level 1] This technique must be followed by an author.  </s>
<s> [Imperative Level 2] This technique should be followed by an author.  </s>
<s> [Imperative Level 3] This technique may be followed by an author.  </s>
<s> (Adapted by Eric Hansen from the 7 Dec 1998 page authoring guidelines.  </s>
<s> Note: I would actually prefer to phrase these differently, but those changes are immaterial to the argument.)  </s>
<s> I submit that these two aspects -- impact and imperative for use -- should be separated.  </s>
<s> And the fact that they are not separated in the 7 December guidelines document is a very serious problem.  </s>
<s> Because each priority level inextricably links both impact and imperative for use, the two aspects cannot vary independently of each other.  </s>
<s> It makes no sense to confound the operation of these two variables.  </s>
<s> This leads to disastrous results.  </s>
<s> For example, when a technique is given a low priority, one does not know whether (a) it is because violation of the technique was not serious, (b) because the working group believes that is not imperative (important) that the technique be used, or (c) both (a) and (b).  </s>
<s> This tight coupling of the "impact" and "imperative for use" aspects is a serious, indeed, a fatal source of bias.  </s>
<s> Section 2.B.  </s>
<s> A Possible Example Let us consider a situation that might arise.  </s>
<s> Suppose that an extremely serious accessibility problem is identified but that the problem is only poorly addressed by page markup and a full solution is extremely expensive.  </s>
<s> Suppose that the high expense of making the change causes the working group to rate it as having a low imperative for use.  </s>
<s> The rating system requires that impact and imperative for use match each other, so the working group has essentially four choices.  </s>
<s> First, they can adjust the impact level down to make it match the imperative for use.  </s>
<s> Second, they can raise the imperative for use rating, making it match the impact level.  </s>
<s> Third, they can both lower the impact level _and_ raise the imperative for use, thereby making them match each other.  </s>
<s> Fourth and finally, they can simply ignore the accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> Section 2.C.  </s>
<s> An Example From the Document I believe that this flaw is already causing significant problems.  </s>
<s> For example, consider guideline A.8 (Ensure tables have necessary markup?) is listed as a priority 1 guideline but a note says "[Editor: no P1 techniques here.]." In the A.8 section of the document there is a note asking "Should this be Pri 1?" My interpretation of this situation is that the working group judged guideline A.8 to address a severe (high "impact") problem regarding tables, such that violation of the guideline would prevent use by one or more groups.  </s>
<s> So they gave the guideline a priority 1 rating.  </s>
<s> Yet there was no technique that they could heartily endorse and give a priority 1 rating.  </s>
<s> Why did they not declare a clear priority 1 to a technique?  </s>
<s> There are many possible reasons for this.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there were concerns about the feasibility, cost, or effectiveness of the available techniques, so they chose to give priority 2 or 3 ratings to the techniques.  </s>
<s> This is just another example show that the guidelines are using the term "priority" to represent an impossible amalgam of "impact" and "imperative to use."  </s>
<s> (Note.  </s>
<s> My basic argument is unaffected by the fact that priorities are being removed from the guidelines.) PART 3: BIAS AGAINST EXPENSIVE PROBLEMS Section 3.A.  </s>
<s> Possible Bias The foregoing example leads to another major problem, i.e., that the document may be biased against addressing issues that cannot be solved inexpensively through page markup.  </s>
<s> This bias, if correct, is significant because it appears to have led to other problems that further threaten the validity of the document.  </s>
<s> The guidelines appear biased toward issues that can be fixed _at a low cost through page markup_ but appears biased against issues that are _more costly or difficult to solve_, even if the seriousness of the problem might justify the cost.  </s>
<s> The document's current stance appears to be that if a problem that cannot be addressed cheaply through page markup then either it does not exist or it is relegated to a lower priority.  </s>
<s> Possible examples of such issues include language, cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, security, and marketing issues.  </s>
<s> (I do not intend to say that there are no inexpensive techniques in these domains.)  </s>
<s> It may seem strange to refer to an unstated emphasis on inexpensive solutions as a form of bias.  </s>
<s> What would be the causes and consequence of such a bias?  </s>
<s> Section 3.B.  </s>
<s> A Possible Motivator for the Bias Why would there be a bias against expensive solutions, even when the solutions might be justified by the seriousness of the accessibility problem?  </s>
<s> Perhaps it boils down the one thing, a concern for "marketing" of the document.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the working group is concerned that if Web developers think that following the accessibility guidelines will be expensive, they won't pay any attention to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Evidence for this marketing concern is found in a statement in the introduction to section A: "_Creating pages that transform gracefully is not more costly_, but requires a different design approach that also makes page compatible with emerging mobile technologies" (emphasis added).  </s>
<s> Frankly, this sounds like marketing hype.  </s>
<s> The document presents no evidence that this assertion is true.  </s>
<s> What may be true, and could perhaps be asserted, is that "Many of the techniques can be implemented at little or no extra cost, especially at the design stage of Web development."  </s>
<s> But to state categorically that the relevant techniques (evidently A.1 through A.12) will not cost more seems untenable.  </s>
<s> If it were mere puffery, it would not be so important.  </s>
<s> But a statement like that further paints the guidelines document into a corner.  </s>
<s> In order to avoid evidence that might disconfirm the assertion that the techniques cost no additional money, the document might either downgrade the imperative for use of expensive techniques or eliminate any reference to the expensive accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> This does Web developers a disservice.  </s>
<s> By failing to warn them of the existence of the problems, they are thereby hindered in their ability to address those problems.  </s>
<s> Is it wrong to be concerned for the marketing or acceptance of the document?  </s>
<s> No. It is absolutely necessary.  </s>
<s> But I think that marketing of the document will be most successful if we tell things like they really are and help Web developers make wise accessibility-related decisions.  </s>
<s> Section 3.C.  </s>
<s> Other Effects I think that there is evidence that the bias may have affected the document in other ways.  </s>
<s> Consider, for example, the issue of "language" that I have raised repeatedly.  </s>
<s> Technique B.3 now addresses the issue partially, but the technique is relegated to a priority 2 level.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the issue is really a high impact issue (level 1) but that the expense involved in addressing it the caused it to have very low imperative for use (level 3) in the eyes of the working group, so a compromise was reached to give it a level 2 priority?  </s>
<s> I have suggested many other issues that could be addressed in the guidelines (e.g., language, cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, marketing, etc.), but, except for partial treatment of the language issue, to best of my knowledge, the other suggestions have been ignored.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the working group could not see a way to address the issues cheaply via page markup and that, therefore, they simply chose to act as though the accessibility problems do not exist?  </s>
<s> The bias against expensive, non-markup-related problems may contribute to another kind of bias.  </s>
<s> The focus on the inexpensive, non-markup-related problems places individuals who are deaf or who have language-related disabilities at a disadvantage relative to individuals who are blind.  </s>
<s> Most of the techniques benefit individual who are blind much more than they help individuals with learning disabilities or deafness.  </s>
<s> Is this fair?  </s>
<s> Many of the accessibility issues that I have raised would benefit individuals who are deaf or have learning disabilities yet these have been largely ignored.  </s>
<s> I wonder if part of the working group's apparent reticence about a systematic tabulation of impacts is that it will make this fact so apparent.  </s>
<s> Do I have a fundamental problem about the document giving more emphasis to problems faced by individuals who are blind?  </s>
<s> No. As long as the scope of the document and the procedures for producing the ratings are documented and justified, I have no problem with it.  </s>
<s> Do I have a fundamental disagreement with having the document focus on issues that can be addressed relatively inexpensively through page markup?  </s>
<s> No. However, what I do have a deep concern about is a failure to explicitly state this as well as failure to acknowledge (by name) several other important and known categories of accessibility-related issues.  </s>
<s> PART 4: WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?  </s>
<s> I believe that in order to address these problems, the following must be done.  </s>
<s> #1.  </s>
<s> Uncouple the "impact" ratings from "imperative for use" ratings.  </s>
<s> They are separate and must be allowed to vary independently (although, in my view, the impact ratings inform the generation of the imperative for use ratings).  </s>
<s> The impact rating indicates the severity of the _problem_ while the imperative for use rating is essentially a rating of the importance of implementing the technique as a _solution_.  </s>
<s> I believe that to keep the two ratings together would continually and fatally bias and confuse the interpretation of the ratings; it would also perpetuate the misconception that cost considerations are unimportant or irrelevant to the document.  </s>
<s> #2.  </s>
<s> Affirm the existence of other important Web accessibility problems even if you don't plan to provide specific guidelines or techniques for addressing them.  </s>
<s> #3.  </s>
<s> Minimize accusations of bias by telling the truth about the document's scope and limitations.  </s>
<s> Provide a principled rationale or justification for the exclusions.  </s>
<s> I don't think that this is that hard to do.  </s>
<s> It just has to be done.  </s>
<s> #4.  </s>
<s> Do not deny the role of cost considerations in the document.  </s>
<s> (a) Do not deny that solving some accessibility issues will cost money.  </s>
<s> (b) Do not deny that the working group considers matters of cost in determining the "imperative for use" ratings or even in determining which problems will be addressed by techniques.  </s>
<s> Financial considerations essential for generating "imperative for use" ratings.  </s>
<s> (The "impact" ratings would be much less affected by cost considerations.) #5.  </s>
<s> Describe how the ratings are produced.  </s>
<s> #6.  </s>
<s> Describe the qualifications of the individuals or group that produced the ratings.  </s>
<s> (Note: I believe that failure to do any of #1 through #5 places an excessive burden -- probably an impossible burden -- upon the expertise and authority of the people making the judgements.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it is fair to expect anyone to shoulder that burden.) How were people with disabilities represented among those developing the ratings?  </s>

<s> Hi Eric RE: THE RATING SYSTEM AND BIAS I don't quite follow your fatal flaw argument.  </s>
<s> The impact IS the determiner of the imperative.  </s>
<s> That is, if the item is required for access, then it is priority 1.  </s>
<s> At least that is what we were using as the rule.  </s>
<s> This rule was worked out after much discussion early in the process.  </s>
<s> The judgements as to what became a priority one then were made based upon asking the question "is it possible to access the information under question if this technique were not done?"  </s>
<s> Each judgement was either taken from listserv discussion comments or made by the editors based on the discussion and then put before the whole working group for discussion and confirmation.  </s>
<s> (and then the whole ig and other external review groups and then the public) Having two sets of ratings sounds like it would be very confusing.  </s>
<s> Especially since the two of them would track each other.  </s>
<s> You said that some things were rated lower because they were difficult.  </s>
<s> Do you have an example of this?  </s>
<s> We are not aware of any.  </s>
<s> There were some problems that existed when we had ratings on the Guidelines?  </s>
<s> but as you noted they have been removed from the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Your comments in previous postings on that only confirmed our tentative decision to pull them and they are now gone.  </s>
<s> Your example was of a guideline priority problem (now gone).  </s>
<s> Do you have any examples with techniques?  </s>
<s> RE: ACCESS HAS NO COST Your comment about the document saying there is no cost for accessibility is a good one.  </s>
<s> That statement goes beyond what it was supposed to.  </s>
<s> Access does not necessarily mean more cost - but it can and in some cases does.  </s>
<s> We will amend that statement to say "_Creating pages that transform gracefully is not NECESSARILY more costly_, but requires a different design approach that also makes page compatible with emerging mobile technologies" You are also correct that the statement is there to help build the case for using the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing out the overstatement.  </s>
<s> RE: TOPICS LIKE cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, marketing, etc THAT ARE NOT COVERED IN THE DOC I have suggested many other issues that could be addressed in the guidelines (e.g., language, cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, marketing, etc.), but, except for partial treatment of the language issue, to best of my knowledge, the other suggestions have been ignored.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the working group could not see a way to address the issues cheaply via page markup and that, therefore, they simply chose to act as though the accessibility problems do not exist?  </s>
<s> RESPONSE The reason these were not included is not because of cost issues.  </s>
<s> It is because these are not disability access issues.  </s>
<s> A person with a disability is not denied access to the information because of cultural or sensitivity issues etc any more than a person without a disability.  </s>
<s> The focus of the guidelines is on accessibility not on good design.  </s>
<s> (though we were sorely tempted to put some good practices into the guidelines that were not access oriented, we either resisted or ended up pulling them back out).  </s>
<s> RE: GREATER FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND This issue has come up many times.  </s>
<s> Help us understand here what you mean exactly.  </s>
<s> The document does not have (that we know of ) a greater focus on people who are blind.  </s>
<s> It addresses every problem we could think of for every disability type.  </s>
<s> At least that has always been the goal.  </s>
<s> There are currently more blindness barriers than there are for say people with hearing disabilities.  </s>
<s> And most physical disabilities are not effected by page design as much as by the design of the User Agent.  </s>
<s> Cognitive is probably the toughest one.  </s>
<s> We have techniques for people with no sight or no hearing or even physical movement.  </s>
<s> But we have no solutions for providing access to most content on the web for people who have no cognition?.  </s>
<s> Or almost no cognition?  </s>
<s> or even moderate to severe impairment of cognition.  </s>
<s> This area starts to move from how the information is presented to the content of the information itself.  </s>
<s> If you have any specific guidelines or techniques that would increase access for people with any type of disability please post them to the list pronto.  </s>
<s> We don't know of any that were missed (but there has been a lot of traffic).  </s>
<s> REGARDING YOUR 6 ACTION ITEMS Each item is below followed by a comment.  </s>

<s> The impact rating indicates the severity of the _problem_ while the imperative for use rating is essentially a rating of the importance of implementing the technique as a _solution_.  </s>
<s> I believe that to keep the two ratings together would continually and fatally bias and confuse the interpretation of the ratings; it would also perpetuate the misconception that cost considerations are unimportant or irrelevant to the document.  </s>
<s> GV: We are only rating the importance of the proposed solutions or techniques.  </s>
<s> We are not rating the problems.  </s>
<s> As you suggest, the ratings of the techniques are derived from the severity of the problem they address.  </s>

<s> The document presents no evidence that this assertion is true.  </s>
<s> What may be true, and could perhaps be asserted, is that "Many of the techniques can be implemented at little or no extra cost, especially at the design stage of Web development."  </s>
<s> But to state categorically that the relevant techniques (evidently A.1 through A.12) will not cost more seems untenable.  </s>
<s> If it were mere puffery, it would not be so important.  </s>
<s> But a statement like that further paints the guidelines document into a corner.  </s>
<s> In order to avoid evidence that might disconfirm the assertion that the techniques cost no additional money, the document might either downgrade the imperative for use of expensive techniques or eliminate any reference to the expensive accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> This does Web developers a disservice.  </s>
<s> By failing to warn them of the existence of the problems, they are thereby hindered in their ability to address those problems.  </s>
<s> Is it wrong to be concerned for the marketing or acceptance of the document?  </s>
<s> No. It is absolutely necessary.  </s>
<s> But I think that marketing of the document will be most successful if we tell things like they really are and help Web developers make wise accessibility-related decisions.  </s>
<s> Section 3.C.  </s>
<s> Other Effects I think that there is evidence that the bias may have affected the document in other ways.  </s>
<s> Consider, for example, the issue of "language" that I have raised repeatedly.  </s>
<s> Technique B.3 now addresses the issue partially, but the technique is relegated to a priority 2 level.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the issue is really a high impact issue (level 1) but that the expense involved in addressing it the caused it to have very low imperative for use (level 3) in the eyes of the working group, so a compromise was reached to give it a level 2 priority?  </s>
<s> I have suggested many other issues that could be addressed in the guidelines (e.g., language, cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, marketing, etc.), but, except for partial treatment of the language issue, to best of my knowledge, the other suggestions have been ignored.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the working group could not see a way to address the issues cheaply via page markup and that, therefore, they simply chose to act as though the accessibility problems do not exist?  </s>
<s> The bias against expensive, non-markup-related problems may contribute to another kind of bias.  </s>
<s> The focus on the inexpensive, non-markup-related problems places individuals who are deaf or who have language-related disabilities at a disadvantage relative to individuals who are blind.  </s>
<s> Most of the techniques benefit individual who are blind much more than they help individuals with learning disabilities or deafness.  </s>
<s> Is this fair?  </s>
<s> Many of the accessibility issues that I have raised would benefit individuals who are deaf or have learning disabilities yet these have been largely ignored.  </s>
<s> I wonder if part of the working group's apparent reticence about a systematic tabulation of impacts is that it will make this fact so apparent.  </s>
<s> Do I have a fundamental problem about the document giving more emphasis to problems faced by individuals who are blind?  </s>
<s> No. As long as the scope of the document and the procedures for producing the ratings are documented and justified, I have no problem with it.  </s>
<s> Do I have a fundamental disagreement with having the document focus on issues that can be addressed relatively inexpensively through page markup?  </s>
<s> No. However, what I do have a deep concern about is a failure to explicitly state this as well as failure to acknowledge (by name) several other important and known categories of accessibility-related issues.  </s>
<s> PART 4: WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?  </s>
<s> I believe that in order to address these problems, the following must be done.  </s>
<s> #1.  </s>
<s> Uncouple the "impact" ratings from "imperative for use" ratings.  </s>
<s> They are separate and must be allowed to vary independently (although, in my view, the impact ratings inform the generation of the imperative for use ratings).  </s>
<s> The impact rating indicates the severity of the _problem_ while the imperative for use rating is essentially a rating of the importance of implementing the technique as a _solution_.  </s>
<s> I believe that to keep the two ratings together would continually and fatally bias and confuse the interpretation of the ratings; it would also perpetuate the misconception that cost considerations are unimportant or irrelevant to the document.  </s>
<s> #2.  </s>
<s> Affirm the existence of other important Web accessibility problems even if you don't plan to provide specific guidelines or techniques for addressing them.  </s>
<s> #3.  </s>
<s> Minimize accusations of bias by telling the truth about the document's scope and limitations.  </s>
<s> Provide a principled rationale or justification for the exclusions.  </s>
<s> I don't think that this is that hard to do.  </s>
<s> It just has to be done.  </s>
<s> #4.  </s>
<s> Do not deny the role of cost considerations in the document.  </s>
<s> (a) Do not deny that solving some accessibility issues will cost money.  </s>
<s> (b) Do not deny that the working group considers matters of cost in determining the "imperative for use" ratings or even in determining which problems will be addressed by techniques.  </s>
<s> Financial considerations essential for generating "imperative for use" ratings.  </s>
<s> (The "impact" ratings would be much less affected by cost considerations.) #5.  </s>
<s> Describe how the ratings are produced.  </s>
<s> #6.  </s>
<s> Describe the qualifications of the individuals or group that produced the ratings.  </s>
<s> (Note: I believe that failure to do any of #1 through #5 places an excessive burden -- probably an impossible burden -- upon the expertise and authority of the people making the judgements.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it is fair to expect anyone to shoulder that burden.) How were people with disabilities represented among those developing the ratings?  </s>

<s> Comments interspersed - look for CMN:: and EH:: CMN:: Please note that these comments represent my response as an individual member of the group, and were written by me alone.  </s>
<s> In particular they do not represent an official position of either the group, the chair, or the w3c.  </s>
<s> Note that each priority has two aspects, (1) impact (2) and imperative for use.  </s>
<s> CMN:: The imperative for use is directly related to the impact.  </s>
<s> If the impact of failure to solve the problem is to make access impossible for some group of users, then the imperative is priority 1.  </s>
<s> If the impact is merely that acessibility is not omptimised, then the imperative is priority 3. If the impact is that accessibility changes from possible but difficult to possible with about the same degree of difficulty as other users experience, then it is priority 2. I agree that there is a judgement call between priority 2 and 3. On the other hand, these definitions are extremely rigorous in their defiinitions of impact, and during the lifetime of the working group have, I submit, become more rigorous and more rigorously applied.  </s>
<s> EH:: [snip] Section 2.C.  </s>
<s> An Example From the Document I believe that this flaw is already causing significant problems.  </s>
<s> For example, consider guideline A.8 (Ensure tables have necessary markup?) is listed as a priority 1 guideline but a note says "[Editor: no P1 techniques here.]." In the A.8 section of the document there is a note asking "Should this be Pri 1?" CMN:: My interpretation (this is a personal interpretation) is that there is an open issue as to whether tables make documents completely inaccessible or merely difficult to access.  </s>
<s> The issues have been covered in the archived mailing list (http://lists.w3.org/Archive/public/w3c-wai-gl).  </s>
<s> It is also a matter of what is, within a group context, often referred to as a 'religious issue'.  </s>
<s> What this means is that there is a very strong feeling that tables should not be used for layout.  </s>
<s> This is a genuine bias in the group.  </s>
<s> However, I think an examination of the treatment of this issue would show that it has in fact been handled in such a way as to neutralise the effect of individual bias on the outcome.  </s>
<s> (Remember, the Working Draft is just that.) EH:: [snip] PART 3: BIAS AGAINST EXPENSIVE PROBLEMS Section 3.A.  </s>
<s> Possible Bias The foregoing example leads to another major problem, i.e., that the document may be biased against addressing issues that cannot be solved inexpensively through page markup.  </s>
<s> This bias, if correct, is significant because it appears to have led to other problems that further threaten the validity of the document.  </s>
<s> CMN:: The only evidence presented is that the document states (as an exercise rightly identified as being in part motivated by a desire to 'sell the product') is the statement that accessible design should not increase cost.  </s>
<s> Actually, it is true that this is not always the case.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the costs are likely to be noticeably higher in sites which use a high degree of video and audio content, and provide very high quality accessibility.  </s>
<s> However, noticeable and significant are different things.  </s>
<s> In general the statement is true.  </s>
<s> EH:: [snip] Consider, for example, the issue of "language" that I have raised repeatedly.  </s>
<s> Technique B.3 now addresses the issue partially, but the technique is relegated to a priority 2 level.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the issue is really a high impact issue (level 1) but that the expense involved in addressing it the caused it to have very low imperative for use (level 3) in the eyes of the working group, so a compromise was reached to give it a level 2 priority?  </s>
<s> CMN:: Of course it is possible.  </s>
<s> However it is not the case.  </s>
<s> Again, the archives contain discussion.  </s>
<s> I have suggested many other issues that could be addressed in the guidelines (e.g., language, cultural, sensitivity, legal, economic, marketing, etc.), but, except for partial treatment of the language issue, to best of my knowledge, the other suggestions have been ignored.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that the working group could not see a way to address the issues cheaply via page markup and that, therefore, they simply chose to act as though the accessibility problems do not exist?  </s>
<s> CMN:: This is a slightly thornier issue.  </s>
<s> The scope of the guidelines is to address issues which effect access to material, specifically by people with disabilities, and specifically in ways which can be addressed by authors.  </s>
<s> Again I refer you to the Archive for discussion - there are topics which have been addressed by the group.  </s>
<s> There are other topics which are addressed by other areas of W3C activity, and are outside the scope of the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> For further information I refer you to the working group home page [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/] and to the charter of the group [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter.html] EH:: [snip] #2.  </s>
<s> Affirm the existence of other important Web accessibility problems even if you don't plan to provide specific guidelines or techniques for addressing them.  </s>
<s> CMN:: This is implicit in the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Things for which there are no solutions are things we suggest must/should/may be avoided, or at the very least an accessible alternative provided (which is regarded as a poor solution but better than none at all) I think that points 3 and 5 are already addressed in the document, and as I have stated above I think that point 4 is based on unsound assumptions, which means that the conclusions drawn are inaccurate.  </s>
<s> EH:: #6. Describe the qualifications of the individuals or group that produced the ratings.  </s>
<s> (Note: I believe that failure to do any of #1 through #5 places an excessive burden -- probably an impossible burden -- upon the expertise and authority of the people making the judgements.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it is fair to expect anyone to shoulder that burden.) How were people with disabilities represented among those developing the ratings?  </s>
<s> CMN:: One of the greatest problems with a voluntary activity, and the Working group is largely that, is not being able to force people to take part.  </s>
<s> Therefore we have had less input from some communities than we may have liked.  </s>
<s> Hopefully this will be addressed by comprehensive review from a wider range of groups than those who have found time to assist in the difficult and lengthy task of creating the document and its various working drafts.  </s>
<s> The qualifications of the people who produced the document require a little searching.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that they are outside the scope of the document, although perhaps they are information that should be kept by the group.  </s>
<s> In any case there are within the group people with a range of experiences and backgrounds.  </s>
<s> While the group is (of course) not perfect, I think that its collective expertise is both deep and broad.  </s>
