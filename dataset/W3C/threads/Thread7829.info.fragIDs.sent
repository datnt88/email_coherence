<s> There are many cases where "fixing up the references" is not feasible.  </s>
<s> For example, if you are not moving a collection, but rather are creating an alias for it (e.g. via BIND), then you need references that work with either of the legal names for the collection.  </s>
<s> Since relative references are trivial for a server to implement, and very useful for many client applications, I believe it is important for them to be supported.  </s>

<s> I've been assuming that we would stand by our general philosophy, that servers never have to verify that the target exists, or track the target as it moves.  </s>
<s> So they don't have to maintain the value of DAV:reftarget.  </s>
<s> Of course, we don't currently forbid servers to do that.  </s>
<s> I've also assumed that servers would generally do the minimum required of them.  </s>
<s> So in general, when they receive a MKRESOURCE to create a redirect reference, they would just stuff the value of DAV:reftarget into the (dead) property.  </s>
<s> The client would know enough about its application to make a judgment about whether a relative or absolute URI in DAV:reftarget would be more likely to survive unbroken over time, given that the server is not going to do anything to maintain it.  </s>
<s> If the application is one where most redirect references have targets within a hierarchy that typically gets moved as a whole, it will be safer to use relative URIs than absolute URIs.  </s>
