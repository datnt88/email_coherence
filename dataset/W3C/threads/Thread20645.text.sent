My installation is on Windows98se, with "Microsoft Family Login." 
That means the NT-style profile directories "%windir%/profiles/%USER%/Application Data/ . . 
." are available and are used by most software that needs a user-specific directory. 
Please consider using the same logic used for NT in this situation!

But it will take MUCH longer if I do it!

Could you give us the value returned by the function GetVersion () Irene. 
Without building and running a program (in what language and library???), how do I access "GetVersion()" ? 
However, this I can do easily: MS Windows 98 4.10.2222 
A Amaya -V 4.2.1 22 December 2000 What more?
