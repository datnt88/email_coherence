Hi, is it possible to set a preference for including the ?xml 
...? directive at the start of XML documents? 
There are some browsers and other applications that misinterpret it, and I believe that it is optional according to the XML specification. 
So if it were possible to leave it out, this wuld make it easier to work with other (admmittedly badly implemented, but widespread) technology. 
My specific problem is for php processing - the fact that Amaya allows me to edit PHP documents is a great help, but at the moment I need to edit this line in the source before finally saving :( Cheers Chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France On Tue, 18 Nov 2003 23:49:15 -0500 (EST) Hi Charles, The "save as in HTML" is exactly what you want to do. 
Isn't it?

I'll look into it - maybe I can just do that.
