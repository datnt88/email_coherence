It will be posted as soon as I am able Jim 
my apologies for missing the meeting, but could not get out of another meeting. 
I would have thought that a web resource that wants to be a textbook as well should meet some additional requirments. 
The DAISY digital talking book concept of a "table of navigation" is one example. 
Did the Texas project review the DAISY /NISO model in any depth and was there a conscious descision not to go beyond the general web content requirements as set forth by the WAI?
