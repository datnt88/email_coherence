<s> Layer has a certain functionality not available with HTML / CSS which is to call an external bit of HTML and make it a part of the same document.  </s>
<s> How does this differ from the illustration given at the end of section 13.5 of the HTML 4.0 specification ("embed_me.html"), in which OBJECT is used to insert a fragment of HTML, from a separate file, into another HTML document?  </s>

<s> supports some CSS extention (url-import) that does the same.  </s>
<s> Actually netscapes guide on layers shows how to do the same with CSS and admits that url-import is an experimental extention.  </s>
<s> EMBED should be deprecated in favor of OBJECT, but EMBED is currently much more widely supported than OBJECT.  </s>
<s> So it seems the guidelines would benefit from not disscussing those.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I would talk much more on CSS and IFRAME in the section on frames, as these may replace a great deal of the functions of the notorious FRAMESET FRAME alternative.  </s>

<s> This is supported in standard HTML by OBJECT.  </s>
<s> I found, to my pleasant surprise, that it actually worked in MSIE (I was using 5b2) when I inserted an HTML document encoded in one charset (koi8-r, say) into an HTML document encoded in a different charset (iso-8859-1, say).  </s>
<s> One aspect that I find to be a shortcoming is that one must define a height and width for the OBJECT, otherwise MSIE does not display it (or displays it at zero size, maybe - well, the perceived effect is the same).  </s>
<s> Having said that it works, I have to admit that I have no especial insights into the accessibility implications of using it.  </s>
<s> best regards  </s>
<s> Layer seems a simple one to dispose of, since it is not widely supported, and does not have any functionality that could not be provided with properly implemented IFRAME or OBJECT elements (ones which allow for control of borders etc).  </s>
<s> EMBED is trickier.  </s>
<s> What other way is there to include a multimedia object such as a video in a page (rather than linking to it as a document)?  </s>
<s> OBJECT and IFRAME could, again, be used, but they are not implemented where EMBED is.  </s>
<s> We should probably think about the accessibility issues related to IFRAME anyway - are they the same as those for FRAME?  </s>

<s> I just think there should be explicit statements that LAYER and EMBED elements should not be used in designing WWW pages.  </s>

<s> LAYER I agree with you.  </s>
<s> For EMBED, the problem is that there is no replacement prior to HTML 4.0 (I may be wrong on this.  </s>
<s> Anyone?) I would recommend that EMBED only be used within the content of an OBJECT (much as I recommend IMG be used, although nobody seems to buy this.  </s>
<s> It may be more of an option for AU though.) since it provides a mechanism which is widely supported, although non-standard.  </s>
<s> This goes back to the 'where possible' provisions.  </s>
<s> It is not possible to provide legacy browsers with an EMBED which is W3C recommended.  </s>
<s> This does not mean that it is not possible to provide the functionality in an accessible way, which is the ultimate goal.  </s>
<s> Just that the non-W3C technology should not be used as the primary means - it is a kluge, and where it can be replaced (eg by using it as content of an OBJECT, then using CSS display:none if possible (I am thinking out loud here and don't know if that works)) an appropriate system must be recommended by the guidelines.  </s>
<s> This is one of those tricky problems that goes to the heart of the matter.  </s>
<s> Arewe ready to discuss this on the call, or is there other agenda material?  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Charles McCathie Nevile said:  </s>
<s> You can compose a SMIL presentation with the web page on layer 1 and the video on layer 2, where it hides a static GIF placeholder for those lacking the video player.  </s>
<s> I think you can, anyway.  </s>

<s> I was thinking here of legacy solutions.  </s>
