Hello, There seems to be an issue with textarea tags. 
Given the example: tidy would change it to: sdfsdf This causes the text to have a space at the begining when the browser renders it. 
Can you please advise how to get notified when a bug is corrected? 
Thank you!

Not when I try it (it gets left alone). 
Which version of Tidy, what options? 
If you are logged into Source Forge when you log a bug, it will email you when a bug is updated. 
But, what Fred said, what is your indent setting? 
Also, what browsers? 
Not that it wouldn't still be a bug. 
Tidy is supposed to be aware of significant whitespace. 
--indent yes is deprecated as it is known to cause rendering changes like this one. 
Try --indent auto instead.
