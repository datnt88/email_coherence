Hi all I took an action item to look at the word "Appropriate" in the 2.0 guidelines to see if it interferes with our "testability" criteria. 
Just for interest, I've included the informative part also after the success criteria items.

[Y] Here are informative parts of the guidelines that use the word "appropriate." 
Examples of Guideline 1.4 (Informative) *Example 1: an acronym in a page title. 
In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is marked as an acronym. 
Because it has been marked appropriately, the user agent would be able to speak the letters of the acronym one at a time rather than attempting to pronounce it as though it were a word. 
Examples of Guideline 1.5 (Informative) *Example 1: documentation for a product. 
Identifying chapters in the structure of a book is appropriate .. Benefits of Guideline 3.1 (Informative) *Phrases from various languages are often interspersed in writing. 
When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with the appropriate accent and pronunciation Benefits of Guideline 3.1 (Informative) *Phrases from various languages are often interspersed in writing. 
When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with the appropriate accent and pronunciation. 
When they are not identified, the speech synthesizer will use the default accent and pronunciation of the language on the rest of the page, which can make the phrase unintelligible. 
Identifying changes in language will also allow a tool to ask for automatic translations of that content. 
When editing content, authoring tools can switch between appropriate spelling dictionaries. 
Benefits of Guideline 3.2 (Informative) *Defining key terms and specialized language will help people who are not familiar with the topic. 
*Providing the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms not only helps people who are not familiar with the abbreviation or acronym but can clarify which meaning of an abbreviation or acronym is appropriate to use. 
Looks like the only way this fits into the definition of "testable" is via the "8 out of 10 experts agree" criteria. 
-Kerstin Hi David I propose we do the following. 
My suggestions in marked with GV: and are inside of Davids report so that you can see them in context. 
In Brief. 1 - Delete the word from Guidelines 2.3 2 - GV: Add an Editors Note to all the rest of the checkpoints cited that reads: Items of the form "The content has been reviewed and." will all be removed from the guidelines as soon as we can figure out how to handle the content referred to by them. 
This type of item is untestable without interviewing the webmaster or manager and because of the word 'appropriate'. 
3 - leave all the words as they are in the informative sections.
