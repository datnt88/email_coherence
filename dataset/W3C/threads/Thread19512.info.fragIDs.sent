<s> I'm following this diskussion and wonder why it is so often stated that Amaya is NOT a browser (i. e. not primarily) but an editor.  </s>
<s> I think Amaya is a fine browser as well, if you want to browse e. g. a local text-only collection and you want to edit it occasionally.  </s>
<s> What I am really missing is the possibility to switch the single/double-click behaviour for browsing.  </s>
<s> I think this should not be too hard ... in relation to the problems which have been solved.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's really a more political problem.  </s>
<s> As we learnt that Microsoft is involved ... (???)  </s>
<s> Please let Amaya be a browser as well ;-) Regards Roland roland.bauer@fff.at  </s>

<s> I don't clam that Amaya shouldn't used as a browser.  </s>
<s> I want just to mention we know that Amaya miss some functionalities to be considered as a good browser.  </s>
<s> Our task force is limited and we clearly give priority to editing functionalities.  </s>
<s> That will be available in next release 2.0 we're preparing for the end of this month.  </s>
<s> There is no problem with Microsoft.  </s>
<s> Microsoft is a W3C member but doesn't influence our developments.  </s>
<s> We choose to focus our activity on editing just because we think that the Web should be a place where users are actors and not only consumers.  </s>

<s> fine! thanks roland roland.bauer@fff.at  </s>
<s> Opening the CVS base to the general public would probably help here.  </s>
<s> That would allow interested parties outside of the W3C to develop Amaya, reducing the load on the core team.  </s>
<s> The recent problems with the filename of the document produced with "make book", and the installation locations are good examples of problems that can be solved without great knowledge of Amaya, and thus could be solved without distracting the core team to any great degree.  </s>
<s> Are there plans to make the CVS tree available soon (possibly to coincide  </s>
<s> with the release of 2.0)?  </s>

<s> Hi Ewan, In-reply-to: Your message of Fri, 23 Apr 1999 11:09:42 +0100."  </s>
<s> It's exactly our plans.  </s>
<s> The CVS base is ready and we will announce its availability with the release 2.0.  </s>

<s> That's excellent - thanks a lot.  </s>
