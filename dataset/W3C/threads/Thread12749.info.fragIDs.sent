<s> Web Content Guidelines WG: If you have any comments on the Quick Tips revision, please send them to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org by today July 15, as mentioned in last week's request &amp; list of proposed changes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0040.html .  </s>
<s> We have to re-order quickly because we are running out, and have a high level of demand for these.  </s>
<s> A few clarifications, based on comments so far: we are only trying to catch discrepancies between WCAG 1.0 and what's on the Quick Tips card.  </s>
<s> We can't add substantially to the length of this and still have this format work well; nor can we diverge from the WCAG 1.0 in terms of message or priorities, so the revision process of the Quick Tips is not the place to work out changes that must go through consensus discussion in WCAG.  </s>
<s> So, for instance, please look at the suggested change on "tables."  </s>
<s> If you think the proposed change more accurately reflects what's in the guidelines, let us know, and vice versa.  </s>
<s> For multimedia, if we drop the end phrase, will key meaning of WCAG 1.0 be lost, or was that end phrase too confusing anyway?  </s>
<s> Thanks much to the folks who've already sent comments -- Michael Muller (Guidelines WG) and Rob Neff and Helle Bjarn?  </s>
<s> (EOWG).  </s>
<s> You can see the discussion at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/1999JulSep/ .  </s>
<s> We need more input.  </s>

<s> Comment #1 (most important): We need more QuickTips cards more than we need better QuickTips cards.  </s>
<s> Keep up the good work.  </s>
<s> Comment #2 (slight improvement): for _image maps_ where it now says .. Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots.  </s>
<s> replace 'and' with 'with' to have -- Use client-side em map /em with text for hotspots.  </s>
<s> Explanation: This makes it clearer that the text is _in_ the map.  </s>
<s> Comment #3 (slight improvement): For _multimedia_, I would have it simply say .. Provide captions and transcripts, and descriptions of video.  </s>
<s> Comment #4 (slight improvement): For hypertext links, I would have it say .. Use text that makes sense when read out of context, not "click here."  </s>
<s> Explanation: The concrete example does help here to establish a firm bond with the reader; they are more sure they know what you are talking about with the example included and they can laugh with you -- builds empathy/rapport.  </s>
<s> But we don't need to be quite so pedantic in marking this as an example.  </s>
<s> Or at least I think that the QuickTips environment is clearly colloquial and we don't have to explicitly set off examples from rules.  </s>
<s> That's it from here.  </s>
<s> Take the changes, or leave the changes, but print more cards!  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Do we want to say, 6.  </s>
<s> At "Image maps.  </s>
<s> Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots."  </s>
<s> I suggest we add "links"  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> Proposed changes include:  </s>
<s> 3. Make "MAP" in second item lower case, but keep it boldface.  </s>
<s> In all the specs I've worked on, we've adoped the convention that element names are in caps and attributes in small letters (and quoted).  </s>
<s> 6. At "Image maps.  </s>
<s> Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots."  </s>
<s> Check that this is consistent with final WCAG.  </s>
<s> The term "hotspots" never appears in WCAG.  </s>
<s> But the ideas are the same: 1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map links, provide redundant text links for each active region of a client-side image map.  </s>
<s> 9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.  </s>
<s> - Ian  </s>
<s> I see by Ian's quote that yes, the WCAG does recommend redundant text links even where the sensitive areas [a.k.a. hotspots] are in a user-side map and have adequate ALT.  </s>
<s> To make this suggestion clear, I think that we need a few more words, something like .. Use a client-side em map /em , and text links as well as image hotspots.  </s>
<s> Explanation: "for hotspots" doesn't expand to redundant links for me in plain English.  </s>
<s> Warning: The "I see by Ian's quote..." is stated with a little reluctance.  </s>
<s> This provision is a bit controversial, to the extent that some may feel that browser implementation of user-side image maps is already sufficient and that redundant text links are thereby not required even now.  </s>
<s> But I don't want to go down that rathole so let's stick to the letter of the 5 May Recommendation (he says to himself).  </s>
<s> Further note: I disagree a bit with Ian to the extent that I don't think we need to worry about using specification conventions in styling this text.  </s>
<s> Anything that sets 'map' off from its context such that all technical terms whether elements or attributes are similarly set off is fine in this non-technical setting.  </s>
<s> It is more important for this document to get the idea across to the technically untutored than to make it look 'right' to the illuminati.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> 3. Make "MAP" in second item lower case, but keep it boldface.  </s>
