<s> 'Talking' Tax Forms For Blind Developed PDF-Reading Software Boosts Independence By Helen Rumbelow Washington Post Staff Writer Friday, August 30, 2002; Page A21 A significant advance in the independence and privacy of blind people has come from what many might think an unlikely source -- the Internal Revenue Service.  </s>
<s> When blind people complain about their tax return, it is not for the usual reasons.  </s>
<s> Until now, most federal forms and many reports posted on the Internet -- a growing line of communication between the government and its citizens -- have been out of bounds to the country's 14 million visually impaired.  </s>
<s> A Braille version doesn't work because the sighted people receiving the form cannot understand it.  </s>
<s> "Screen-reading" software that reads text out loud cannot cope with forms and other reports using "PDF" -- Portable Document Format.  </s>
<s> The screen-reader can't read PDF because it views the screen as a picture rather than words.  </s>
<s> This has frustrated visually impaired people who have wanted to take advantage of government online services, from applying for jobs to researching a homework project.  </s>
<s> The new IRS forms, which the IRS plans to post on its Web site (www.IRS.gov) next year, use pioneering software that allows the standard talking text services to read forms stored in PDF.  </s>
<s> "It may seem like just a tax form, but we've hit what we believe is a true breakthrough, important because blind people want to be independent," said Michael Moore, chief of alternative media at the IRS, and legally blind himself.  </s>
<s> "What blind people are striving for is equal access."  </s>
<s> The software was developed by Plexus Scientific Corp. in conjunction with the agency.  </s>
<s> The IRS is demonstrating the "talking tax form" next week to other agencies that are also grappling with the problem of making their online services accessible to the visually impaired.  </s>
<s> Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which went into effect in June last year, requires all federal agencies to make their systems, Web sites and documents accessible to those with disabilities.  </s>
<s> A recent survey by San Francisco State University and PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 87 percent of federal Web sites still fail to meet accessibility standards required by law.  </s>
<s> Moore recently showed how the program works.  </s>
<s> When he clicks on the "talking" version of the1040EZ tax form on the IRS Web site, his normal screen-reader begins to read the first line in its electronic monotone.  </s>
<s> "First name," it says, and Moore responds by typing in the box; he also has the option of speaking his name and having the computer convert it into text.  </s>
<s> "Some people are surprised that there isn't already a way for blind people to use these forms, but it's finally happened," Moore said.  </s>
<s> "We're the first doing this in government; as far as I know, the first in the world to be able to make PDF forms accessible."  </s>
<s> Curtis Chong, director of technology for the National Federation of the Blind, said PDF has been a pet-hate of many blind people for years.  </s>
<s> "When forms started to go up online, we got really excited, but when we went to look at them on places like the IRS Web site, we found we couldn't use them," Chong said.  </s>
<s> "If this does what it promises then there is some real groundbreaking potential here.  </s>
<s> It's not just about saving the money for an accountant, but privacy and independence and getting access to information."  </s>
<s> The problem of computer accessibility is also important to the IRS, Moore said, because it has actively recruited blind workers.  </s>
<s> The agency has 1,100 employees who are blind or have low vision, 1 percent of its workforce.  </s>
<s> Soon after Section 508 came into effect, the IRS asked Plexus Scientific to try and crack the problem of PDF.  </s>
<s> The project cost around $1 million, with much of the funds contributed by Adobe Systems Inc., the makers of PDF.  </s>
<s> Doug Wakefield, in charge of Section 508 at the federal Access Board, said this new software is "crucial" to making government more accessible.  </s>
<s> "This will have a very significant impact .  </s>
<s> . .  </s>
<s> There have been other attempts to make PDF forms accessible, but they haven't been taken up because they have been too expensive," he said.  </s>
<s> The IRS hopes to have 50 of the most common forms in "talking" format for next tax season.  </s>
<s> It will cost the agency a one-time payment of about $2,000 per form for Plexus to convert them.  </s>
<s> Leonard Newman, project manager at Plexus Scientific, said the problem with PDF was that even when the screen-reader was persuaded to read the text, it read it as a jumble, mixing up text with no sense of the flow of the form.  </s>
<s> By putting special computer tags in the form, Plexus was able to create a kind of road map for the screen-reader, instructing it where to pause to allow the blind person to fill in his or her details, and telling it which box followed next.  </s>
<s> "The joke here is that it is the first time you want the IRS talking to you," Newman said.  </s>

<s> I think this is great, sort of.  </s>
<s> But PDF forms seem like overkill.  </s>
<s> How are the PDF forms better than standard HTML forms for this kind of application?  </s>
<s> I guess one upside is that they can be filled out offline.  </s>
<s> But if they are meant to be filled online, why not just have a standard web page?  </s>
<s> I'm sure there's more to the story than that one article, though, including the reason they needed to make the forms PDFs.  </s>
<s> Anyone know why?  </s>
<s> easy answer to your last question, that is what the decided to do years  </s>
<s> ago so rather than find a real solution they decided to cludge.  </s>
<s> Html would have been vastly superior and there are many other things they could have done and can do, but dispite frequent pounding on them, they  </s>
<s> like some other agencies have stayed a particular course for what ever reasons but the bottom line is that the consumer looses in the end.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> gains in this case apparently are the same forms can be served to all and pdf is their favorite route so they can still use it.  </s>
<s> They have a lot of money tied up in it apparently.  </s>

<s> Anyone know why?  </s>
<s> Quite often people processing forms that are normally filled out by hand appreciate having a consistent visual layout - this won't be the case normally for HTML forms printed off the Web, at least as long as people use the older generations of browsers in large numbers.  </s>
<s> Quite often what happens is that the forms are scanned into an electronic form, and this is already difficult without having to deal with varying layouts.  </s>
<s> Of course if the form is filled in online then it can be printed or not by the organisation in any way they like.  </s>
<s> The benefit of HTML forms is that doing what is claimed here as a potential world first for PDF (it may well be) has been possible in HTML for years, and works on a wide variety of platforms.  </s>
<s> (The article doesn't say whether you are going to be forced to buy particular computer systems to take advantage of this new service).  </s>
<s> The drawback has been inconsistent printing - with real print stylesheets implementation that is going away, but there is no doubt that PDF was ahead in this respect.  </s>
<s> So the big question is whether the information is being managed on paper or electronically - for the former PDF has the edge, for the latter HTML does.  </s>
<s> And as far as I know most Americans still fill out their tax treturns on paper, so I would expect that to be the logic the Tax office is using.  </s>
<s> (Besides, $1 million in research and development spending creates jobs and  </s>
<s> expertise for the people working on it.  </s>
<s> Having more people and companies  </s>
<s> understanding some of the issues involved in accessibility is generally a  </s>
<s> good thing, in my opinion...).  </s>

<s> Could they provide both a PDF forms and HTML forms to cover all the bases?  </s>
<s> And both would integrate into the same back-end system?  </s>
<s> Maybe they do?  </s>
<s> Maybe they're going that way?  </s>
<s> Standard web forms would no only help assistive technology users, but also text browser users, PDA users, WebTV users, and anyone else who can't run Acrobat.  </s>
<s> BTW, I found this on the IRS web site's accessibility page: tml Persons using screen-reading devices, who generally cannot directly read documents in PDF format, will find a HTML version of many of the forms and the publications on the IRS site.  </s>
<s> Over the next several months, the IRS plans to make all PDF files accessible.  </s>
<s> As new publications become available in Acrobat 5.0, which is 508 compliant, they will be posted on the site.  </s>
<s> For information on Forms and Publications Accessibility: The IRS Alternative Media Center has prepared hundreds of its most popular tax forms, instructions, and tax publications using full text descriptions where needed and is making these files available for download through the IRS web site.  </s>
<s> Adobe Acrobat PDF format has been used as a means of distributing government forms as well as other documents.  </s>
<s> BTW, I checked their forms section and selected a few forms to see what formats they had available.  </s>
<s> Of the dozen I selected, none had any other formats than PDF.  </s>
<s> Where are the HTML versions they speak of?  </s>

<s> I guess the eFile program offers some forms online.  </s>
<s> But none are through the IRS itself, and some cost money.  </s>
<s> Maybe that's why the IRS is reluctant?  </s>
<s> What they have done is seg way but in a different direction.  </s>
<s> They had placed some html forms on the site before they had their current *solution* in place, but as you observed, those html forms seem not to be there any more and the article pretty much tells the story.  </s>
<s> Reading the snip you provide below, it is apparent that they are staying the course of pdf and that the html wsa only a temporary stop gap measure.  </s>

<s> Or has it just not yet reached the Windows desktop in shrinkwrap?  </s>

<s> Talking tax forms sound like a real step forward.  </s>
<s> It has been difficult, especially in recent years, to find tax programs that would talk well enough for a blind person to use, so broadening the options will be a great thing.  </s>
<s> The still-very-present problem is access to the *inputs* to the forms, namely the W-2's, 1099's, and the like.  </s>
<s> I wonder how access to those is going.  </s>
