It is wasteful for you and me to be arguing whether the author should put information about the link target in the IMG.ALT or A.TITLE when the authors have not populated either, nor will they. 
I need you to join me in teaching the group to demand a more radical solution such that the navigability is preserved even when the authors don't do anything extra. 
My note at tries to follow your model for what WAI should do to capture a problem for the experts. 
Can you give us a response to that message that is articulated in the proper language of DOM, XML, RDF, etc? 
We need a long-range plan for communicating the necessary information about the link target that does not generate busywork for authors. 
Once we have that, perhaps we can see our way clear to saying something about ALT in the short term that is compatible with the browsers in the field today.

Thanks. Make that with an underscore in the file name and it may work.
