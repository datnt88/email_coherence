My apologies, as I am not entirely sure this question belongs here. 
I am quite new to WebDAV, and have run into a few problems. 
I've been staring at this particular problem for quite some time, and am hoping I can get a fresh set of eyes to have a look. 
Basically, when I attempt to open a web folder (using Davenport as the DAV server), I get the message 'Internet Explorer could not open .Would you like to use the default view instead?'. 
I have tried a slew of changes to the Davenport source code with varying degrees of success. 
In this example, the 'shares' share will not display properly in a Web Folder view. 
If I attempt to view a subdirectory as a Web Folder however, the subdirectory will display properly in Web Folders view. 
I am using Windows XP with IE6 (both fully patched) for the DAV client. 
See the listing below for the request/response.

I'd start by removinf everything that's not required or not plain DAV, notably In particular, having non-zero content lengths may be confusing for the webfolder client. 
Regards, Julian Well one nit is that Multistatus is usually 207, not 200, as in the body. 
Normally collections don't have getcontenttype, getcontentlength, or getetag. 
I don't know if that's what's throwing off Web Folders. 
There are examples of PROPFIND responses that work with Internet Explorer in my book :) -1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3410589-6207009?v=glance http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0130652083/qid=1076106098/sr= 
1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3410589-6207009?v=glance&amp;s=books &amp;s=books You can also try comparing to the PROPFIND responses you get querying directories on www.sharemation.com 
(where you can sign up for a free account). 
Sharemation runs Xythos software. 
Similarly there are other servers running other DAV implementations that are known to work well with Web Folders - e.g. anything running mod_dav. 
You might be able to PROPFIND www.webdav.org.

1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z /creationdate getcontentlength w:dt="int" 98626961408 /getcontentlength Thanks, Mike The status *inside* the body correctly is a 200, it's just mislabeled as "multistatus" (that should be irrelevant, only the numeric code matters). 
Julian Just an FYI for anyone interested... 
I worked through this problem with the help of the jCIFS list. 
We identified a couple potential problem areas, so I updated Davenport with some suggestions there: I made the following updates to Davenport as per Julian's suggestions (on the jCIFS list): - Removed Microsoft proprietary properties. 
- Does not return unknown timestamps (0 value) - Does not return unknown eTags. 
- Does not return a content length (where the resource is a Share) These changes allow the web folder to open properly in my XP client. 
It was in fact the getcontentlength property that 'broke' the client. 
Thanks for your help.
