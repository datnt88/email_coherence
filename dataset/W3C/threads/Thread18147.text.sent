I'm going to have to ask that someone else take a crack at adding to checkpoint 4.10. 
Here is what I have so far! 
4.1 Allow the user to configure and control the reference size of rendered text with an option to override author-specified and user agent default sizes of rendered text. 
Make available the range of system font sizes. 
[Priority 1] ( Here is what I can contribute to this checkpoint. 
From the pwWebSpeak help file: heading 1. WebSpeak Display Options To increase the character size of the display, press Shift+F11. 
To decrease the character size of the display, press Control+F11. 
To switch through the pre-set background display colors, press Control+F12. 
To switch through the pre-set foreground display colors, press Shift+F12. 
4.10 Allow the user to configure and control synthesized speech playback rate according to the full range offered by the speech synthesizer. 
The lower bound for this range must be at most 120 words per minute. 
The upper bound for this range must be at least 400 words per minute. 
The user must be able to increase or decrease the playback rate in increments of 5% of the current playback rate. 
[Priority 1] techniques for 4.10 A. User agent reviewed: JFW version 3.70.47 
Using the Voice option it is possable to increase or decrease the rate of the spoken text. 
To do this: 1. Press INSERT+J This brings up the JAWS program interface. 
2. Press V to get into the voice menu. 
3. At this point, you have 3 choices to effect the speech rate. 
G for Global, J for Jaws cursor or P for PC cursor. 
To change the rate globally, Press G for global and R for rate. 
4. The rate can be varied from 75 to 650 words per minute. 
B. pwWebSpeak With pwWebSpeak, the changing of speech rate is defined in the WEBSPEAK.KEY file. 
The default is to use ALT+F to increase the speech rate, and ALT+L to decrease the speech rate. 
the configurability of jfw speecking rate is dependant on the synthesizer used and is even marked up differently depending on the synth/driver used.

Hello David: You are corect about that, and I feel that this is beyond our abilities to document. 
This is an example, and should be treatted as such! 
For the record, and I'm sorry that I didn't include it, the synthesizer I used was DecTalk Access 32 software. 
******* MQ ******* Behalf Of David Poehlman the configurability of jfw speecking rate is dependant on the synthesizer used and is even marked up differently depending on the synth/driver used.
