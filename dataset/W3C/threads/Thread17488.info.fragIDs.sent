<s> Hi Susan, I hope you read my Web Course on scripts (http://jimthatcher.com/webcoursea.htm#Webcourse10.D) and followed the recommendation for DHMTL menus - BECAUSE you have done it exactly as I recommend.  </s>
<s> Terrific!  </s>
<s> The idea of making the submenu links available on the page that the main menu link opens - is the only practical way of making these menu systems accessible .  </s>
<s> in my opinion.  </s>
<s> I will try to remember to use  </s>
<s> CSU.org as an example in the future instead of NSF.gov.  </s>
<s> On the accesskey question, as Mathew has already pointed out, display: hidden doesn't work.  </s>
<s> In fact it doesn't work for screen readers either.  </s>
<s> I strongly recommend using a visible skip link - on the far right, top.  </s>
<s> You could make it the same color as the background of your menu items - or  </s>
<s> lighter (I'm not a designer).  </s>
<s> If the designers (you?) aren't able to deal with that, then use an invisible gif (sigh!) to the right of the logo.  </s>
<s> Lots of room!  </s>
<s> I don't have a visible skip link on my site (http://jimthatcher.com http://jimthatcher.com/ ) but I I will in the next version.  </s>
<s> Beautiful site!  </s>

<s> Hi Jim, Susan, and the list: May I build on Jim's suggestion of a visible skip navigation and suggest that the page have several visable skips where there is content that can be skipped to get to other content or areas of the page.  </s>
<s> It doesnt have to be labelled skip navigation (the top like Jim said should be something close to that) but the rest could be, and probably should be more clear to where it is going or what is being skipped.  </s>
<s> For  </s>
<s> example "Back to top" after an article or "Next set of sale items" if they are grouped in sets.  </s>
<s> The reason I ask this is because Skip Navigation has started to take hold, but we generally thought of as skipping past a long set of links for those using screen readers.  </s>
<s> But skipping around a page is also great for sighted users having to use a  </s>
<s> keyboard for navigation.  </s>
<s> I like to think about using a single switch  </s>
<s> (big red button for example) to move around the screen and getting to different parts of the site.  </s>
<s> If I can do that "relatively" easily with a switch as input, then I have designed a good page navigation system that would also include screen readers.  </s>

<s> Jim Thatcher said:  </s>
<s> The solution for what Steve suggests should be "headings" markup and thus  </s>
<s> headings navigation.  </s>
<s> It is a solution for screen reader users today, but as far as I know there is no keyboard value for headings yet.  </s>
<s> I worry at the  </s>
<s> suggestion of several skip links - it could end up like my favorite example of how not to do skip links (http://www.jimthatcher.com/whatnot2004/CSUN-WN-8.5.htm) where over half the words on the page were skip link words.  </s>

<s> like Opera have had headings navigation for almost a decade, and one of  </s>
<s> the common script-based add-ons to Explorer and Mozilla (lots of people produce these, including Jon Gunderson's group at uiuc, Jim Ley, and more recently NILS) for accessibility is indeed keyboard-based headings navigation.  </s>
<s> I think this demonstrates precisely why the skip links thing is a bit of a hack designed to get around the fact that most user agents never got the hang of grouping links and passing over them - something that was readily available in HTML in the mid-90s (and was implemented in early browsers like Lynx).  </s>
<s> I agree with Jim that having a page which grows an extra 15 links which all say "skip this" or something similar isn't a huge net win.  </s>

<s> If you have that much to skip, perhaps it needs its own page.  </s>
<s> If you need a long page, you need link groupings as long as it is necessary to use a keyboard in a crippled user agent that is the most accessible around for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> We are a small minority, but on the other hand, making things tabable does not hurt anyone.  </s>
