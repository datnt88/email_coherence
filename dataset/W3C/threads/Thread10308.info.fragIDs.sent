<s> The relevant Jena developers are out next week, we may be able to send some reports today and tomorrow.  </s>
<s> We are unlikely to give an integrated report - and it may well be of the sort like "we passed all the parser tests".  </s>

<s> Hi Eric, This is a summary of the testresults with Euler for Euler is an inference engine supporting logic based proofs.  </s>
<s> It is a backward-chaining reasoner enhanced with Euler path detection and will tell you whether a given set of facts and rules supports a given conclusion.  </s>
<s> More details are at To parse the manifests and the test documents Jena 2 is used and we then just run the entailment tests.  </s>
<s> We assume that we PASS a test when: a proof is found for a PositiveEntailmentTest or no proof is found for a NegativeEntailmentTest seen as a PositiveEntailmentTest The results are: tests PASS FAIL PositiveEntailmentTest 21 21 0 NegativeEntailmentTest 22 17 5 43 38 5 (those failures are due to the fact that we have partial builtin datatype support and we have no means to switch it off) The detailed results are: #proofFound_RDF_PositiveEntailmentTest #PASS .  </s>
