<s> Attached are two documents One is a table and the other is a linearization of the table.  </s>
<s> (an unwrapped table) We have tried to a number of things in the table First we tried to rate them as being important for - Accessibility (eg info not avail unless done) - Severe Usability (need it to understand the info) - Usability (hard to use info if not done_ - Useful (helpful ) Second we tried to determine when the rating occured - always - only when old browsers or AT were used - (future) Third we tried to collapse the number (from 56 guidelines) by grouping similar items together under a more general guideline.  </s>
<s> (the old items can then appear as strategies for achieving the major goals) We also identified two that we think could be deleted.  </s>
<s> The result is a reduction of the guidelines from 56 or 58 down to 35 This is just a rough pass.  </s>
<s> Comments welcome.  </s>
<s> We will be working on this and discussing it further on the conf call.  </s>
