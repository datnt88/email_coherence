There's at least one problem with my proposed wording for the explnation of Level 1 success criteria: LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Do not set limits on content or presentation; The problem is that it's incorrect: by requiring text equivalents for non-text elements we *are* making demands on content and presentation (alt text, captions, and longdescs all involve content, and they have to be presented somehow). 
I think we can delete this item and leave the remaining ones in place. 
Doing so might even have the benefit of making the difference between Levels 1 and 2 clearer.

passcode 9224 irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag Agenda for this week 1. Action items 2. Conformance - Do all items at all 3 levels needed to be testable? 
[1] - Do we want to have advisory items that are not testable in the guidelines doc? 
- Working definition of the criteria for placing items in each of the three levels [2] - consensus about whether or not all of the 3rd group need to be met to claim 3rd category of conformance? 
- what do we want to call the 3 levels of conformance - should we coord w/EO - is the naming more of a marketing than technical issue?) 3. open issues, - Color - Issue 317 Gregg [1] Current Proposal Success criteria for all levels would be testable. 
Some success criteria may be machine-testable. 
Others may require human judgment. 
Success criteria that require human testing would, in the judgment of the working group members, yield consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers. 
[2] Latest proposal - based on John's submission and working group discussion - but does not yet reflect our decisions regarding scope - so will need discussion and editing. 
LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Do not set limits on content or presentation; 2. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup, scripting, or other technologies that interact with user agents, including assistive technologies; 3. The working group felt could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources; LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Build on Level 1; 2. Increase accessibility both though additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility and through content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility without requiring intervention by user agents or assistive technology; 3. The working group felt could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources; LEVEL 3 SUCCESS CRITERIA 1. Go beyond Level 1 and 2 to increase direct and user agent enhanced accessibility This makes sense to me, but given that I am still guessing at what the actual requirements will be I am not certain yet how to apply priorities... cheers Chaals I think this was originally something like 1. Do not set limits on default presentation and contents; That is, what the author expects to be presented to the majority of people who view their content. 
But it still isn't clear whether we need this one or not. 
Some are much in favor of it but I wonder if it is covered by #2 or not.

That is the issue I have been raising on the list and in last week's call : the main distinction between level 1 and 2 is freedom of content presentation. 
At least this was the assumption till the March 11 draft. 
This was the basis for categorizing criteria as level 1 and 2. Now the words: 2. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup,...", require us to reconsider the classification. 
And should we throw the concept of "freedom of content presentation" out of the window? 
Ref: mails from John and Charles. 
2. And is use of mark-up etc the only way of providing "minimum accessibility"? 
Consider a link to an audio presentation. 
The author might present the text transcript on the same page itself. 
This I suppose is "direct accessibility without requiring intervention by user agents or assistive technology", and is hence a level 2 resolution of the problem. 
So complying with a level 2 criterion can also ensure minimum accessibility- a feature of level 1 at present. 
In other words minimum accessibility can be provided by a level 1 or 2 criteria, right? 
Using a title attribute on an image is markup and when used along with alt enhances accessibility. 
It depends on user agent and AT. 
So it is a level 1 criteria that is doing the enhancement. 
Right? 
Looks like we still have some way to go!

* Ah Good point So it looks like Level 1 items should be something of the form "Do it directly or in a way that a user agent can present it" And level 2 (or 3 ) might be "Do it directly" Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Ind. Engr.
