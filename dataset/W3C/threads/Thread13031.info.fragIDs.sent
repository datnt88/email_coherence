One of the auxiliary resources that we have needed in order to complete the 
resource suite for "Implementation Planning for Web Accessibility" is "Selecting Software for Developing Accessible Web Sites." 
I've written a first draft of this, based on our discussion last week. 
There is no simple answer to give people on this issue at this time, but I've tried to capture some guidance on how to find out more information and 
make decisions about software selection. 
Please note that it is set up as though it were part of the implementation planning resource suite, even though the other documents in the suite do not yet have matching navigation bars, nor are they linked to this draft yet. 
Please take a look and let's discuss it at our meeting today:

There is not much point saying this document must not be referenced or quoted in any form - that is required to make useful comment on it. 
I suggest something like "should not be referenced or quoted except as work in progress. 
Readers should note that this document is likely to be updated and changed." 
There are many examples of this in W3C Working Drafts. 
It would be useful if there was a dated version identifier as well as a latest version URI - particularly in terms of review comments. 
(This review was made on the version provided at 0630UTC 14122001) 
The Site Map link should probably say "WAI site map" - at first I actually expected either a W3C map or one for this suite. 
I like the suite links "As of the last revision of this document, no single authoring tool meets all requirements of Level A Conformance to ATAG 1.0;" should be "no tool is known to conform to..." 
"The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AUWG) periodically reviews authoring tools to test their conformance with ATAG 1.0." 
The working group does not do the reviews, it just collects them. 
Some are done by members of the group, some are done by other people. 
Many of the reviews are up to date, although they are not complete reviews - normally covering some sections of ATAG only. 
* When selecting new or replacement software: + Which applications are more conformant with ATAG 1.0? 
+ Which applications have a more accessible user interface? 
Accessibility of the User interface is part of conformance to ATAG 1.0, so the question is redundant. 
Another question to ask is which tool meets the particular accessibility requirements of current staff, which tools will meet possible new needs? 
cheers Charles Please take a look and let's discuss it at our meeting today: 
This is in fact derived from some W3C Working Drafts, and standard in EOWG drafts, although due for a change, but still for something as short as possible. 
Date is there, at bottom of document, and serves as version identifier. 
There is a lobby to move it near top. 
There is another lobby to keep tops of WAI Resource docs free of as much doc status info as possible so reader can fall in. 
May re-try status links from doc top [editor - status - updated - copyright] to info at bottom of doc. 
WAI Resource docs are edited in place, rather than w/ latest version URI's. 
Experimenting w/ shortened version of all the nav links. 
Good to know which ones become the most confusing. 
Right. 
OK. 
Difficult to tell which are up to date. 
Some of the dates are quite old &amp; not clear whether there are later product versions. 
Why not complete reviews? 
Right. 
This might leave some procurement people puzzled, particularly the part about trying to predict the future. 
But we can experiment with different tweaks of this.

Hi Judy, A few comments: 1. 
A great start - well done! 
2. Introduction 2.1 wrt "explains to software developers how to make software that supports production of accessible Web sites and is accessible to people with disabilities" Try "explains to software developers how to make web authoring software that is accessible to people with disabilities and supports production of accessible Web sites" 2.2 wrt "questions that one can ask of software vendors to identify more conformant" Try "questions that one can ask of software vendors or custom authoring system developers to identify more conformant" 3. Software Guidelines 3.1 wrt "ATAG 1.0 advises ... and more" I stronly think that we should mention that the pe\roducts should be accessible (i.e. usable) by people with disabilities. 
3.2 wrt "database-generation tools" maybe should be "database-driven content management tools" 3.3 Can we include a point along the line that smaller, stand-alone tools will comply more quicly than large CMS due to their realtively shorter development and upgrade life-cycles? 
3.4 Can we also inlcude a point about being aware of the failings/limitations of your authoring tool(s) and compensating with management processes where possible 4. Product Reviews 4.1 Charles' comments cover most of what I would have said here. 
4.2 "WAI maintains links to accessibility pages for many developers" may be better as "WAI maintains links to accessibility pages for many mainstream authoring tool developers" as there are no CMS companies listed and there are unlikely to be small bespoke authoring system developers ever listed. 
I actually have a few links that could be added to this page. 
(Judy, can I amend page, or should I send to editors?) 5. Vendor Queries 5.1 When selecting new or replacement software - add subpoint along the lines of "Which vendors acknowledge their incomplete ATAG 1.0 conformance and list the areas of non-conformance to allow you to better manage your accessibility goals" 5.2 When reviewing software procurement practices - change subpont one from "allow purchase" to "encourage purchase" Well, my two-bob's worth of comment.

Maybe I am just to used to W3C specifications. 
I think that you could have a single link "Document info (editor, date etc)" at the top, or simply establish a look and feel for the suite and let people get used to it - there are a lot of documents that have that information at the bottom. 
Having easy access to previous versions is helpful for an ongoing review process and checking what has happened before. 
Difficult to tell which are up to date. 
Some of the dates are quite old &amp; not clear whether there are later product versions. 
OK, the working group will think about ways to make it clearer and more useful. 
(Feedback on any of the group's pages is welcome - it helps also to know if people are looking at pages) Why not complete reviews? 
Time usually, expertise sometimes. 
Evaluating an authoring tool can be a complex process and is often fairly lengthy. 
Most of the reviews are done by volunteers with limited time available, and some questions require technical knowledge of the tool that is not always readily available. 
This might leave some procurement people puzzled, particularly the part about trying to predict the future. 
But we can experiment with different tweaks of this. 
Yes, I think that some work on the wording would be important. 
I haven't ever tried to express it in this brief a form before. 
cheers Charles
