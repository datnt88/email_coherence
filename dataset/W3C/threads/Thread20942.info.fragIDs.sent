<s> Hows the DAV support with the new release?  </s>
<s> Do we have to do anything special other than --with-dav during configure?  </s>
<s> Normally no except to have a WebDAV server.  </s>
<s> Also is the Motif support still in?  </s>
<s> Can Amaya be used with _just_ Motif (i.e. without GTK)?  </s>
<s> We're stopping the support of Motif and we're developing a new version based on wxWidget.  </s>
