Mirror still "through a glass darkly?"

Our web severs are mirrored. 
It may be a mirroring delay. 
You can get it for sure from the USA ftp servers. 
Thanks for the report.

Yeah, I got a 404 error on that too, but the adjacent ftp link is working fine.

This did work before: What is wrong with it?

Two weirdnesses: I use positioning via CSS on the file in Amaya; the profile error is weird because I'd just validated both the XHTML and CSS. 
In fact I'm unclear about what/why I'm now required to furnish a "profile"? 
"Document encoding unknown or undefined - see the log file" What log file? 
"fix file or change profile" is a puzzle. 
Is Amaya's handling of "float" standard?

Hi: I don't think your problem is related specifically to css positioning. 
I'm having the same problem with my pages which use a linked stylesheet (no positioning though), and I'm looking into using meta tags to specify document encoding.

Sorry not to "Read The Flipping Manual" what browsers will display math 
files (*.MML) so I can include this and display something like from a *.HTML file (if is possible) I just made with Amaya version #4. 
It is a pity Amaya puts little black boxes were carriage returns are, that's why I don't normally use it 
The little black boxes were taken out with "HTML Kit" from or you can use Wordpad. 
From Eric 
The XML parser is right, this sequence of tags is wrong: I guess the second i should be /i . 
Irene. 
As there is no encoding specification in your document, the default is UTF8. 
This Amaya release works in ISO-latin, so if your document includes more that ASCII characters, Amaya could interpret them by error as ISO latin characters. 
This message is just a warning that lets you know that. 
Not yet. 
Irene. 
[DJW:] The black boxes are almost certainly line feeds, i.e. Unix style newline characters. 
Carriage returns (i.e. Mac style newlines) would produce the same effect on notepad. 
notepad requires Microsoft style newlines (carriage return followed by line feed). 
pfe32 will handle Unix style text files under Windows.

Hi Eric, 
In my experience, Amaya is the one of very few browsers that supports Amaya 
natively. 
Your next best choice would be the E-Lite browser &amp; related 
components. 
Go to http://www.w3.org/Math/#Software for a list of MathML software, with appropriate links, including E-Lite and the ubiquitous Amaya.

umm, make that second "Amaya", "MathML". 
Sorry. 
It's late.
