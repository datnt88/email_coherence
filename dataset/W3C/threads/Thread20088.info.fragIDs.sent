<s> Two weirdnesses: I use positioning via CSS on the file in Amaya; the profile error is weird because I'd just validated both the XHTML and CSS.  </s>
<s> In fact I'm unclear about what/why I'm now required to furnish a "profile"?  </s>
<s> "Document encoding unknown or undefined - see the log file" What log file?  </s>
<s> "fix file or change profile" is a puzzle.  </s>
<s> Is Amaya's handling of "float" standard?  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Hi: I don't think your problem is related specifically to css positioning.  </s>
<s> I'm having the same problem with my pages which use a linked stylesheet (no positioning though), and I'm looking into using meta tags to specify document encoding.  </s>

<s> files (*.MML) so I can include this and display something like from a *.HTML file (if is possible) I just made with Amaya version #4.  </s>
<s> It is a pity Amaya puts little black boxes were carriage returns are, that's why I don't normally use it  </s>
<s> The little black boxes were taken out with "HTML Kit" from or you can use Wordpad.  </s>
<s> From Eric  </s>
<s> The XML parser is right, this sequence of tags is wrong: I guess the second i should be /i .  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> As there is no encoding specification in your document, the default is UTF8.  </s>
<s> This Amaya release works in ISO-latin, so if your document includes more that ASCII characters, Amaya could interpret them by error as ISO latin characters.  </s>
<s> This message is just a warning that lets you know that.  </s>
<s> Not yet.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] The black boxes are almost certainly line feeds, i.e. Unix style newline characters.  </s>
<s> Carriage returns (i.e. Mac style newlines) would produce the same effect on notepad.  </s>
<s> notepad requires Microsoft style newlines (carriage return followed by line feed).  </s>
<s> pfe32 will handle Unix style text files under Windows.  </s>
