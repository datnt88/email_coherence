<s> Paul Cotton replied in response to a request for a primer.  </s>
<s> No one in either of the WGs has proposed the need for such a Primer.  </s>
<s> Paul, I guess that shows the value of the specifications being open to public comment.  </s>
<s> If the WG members haven't already proposed a primer, it seems to me to be a surprising omission.  </s>
<s> In fact we are trying to make the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 language  </s>
<s> documents  themselves as "usable" and "approachable" as possible and hope this makes having  a Primer unnecessary.  </s>
<s> Given the passage of time since I first raised the issue I will simply comment that, at least as judged by the November 2002 WDs, there is in my view a VERY long way to go to make the specification documents "approachable".  </s>
<s> I reiterate my request for the WG(s) to consider producing one or more primer documents to significantly improve the level of approachability of these specifications.  </s>

<s> I am convinced that a large number of introductory articles, papers and books are and will become available on XQuery.  </s>
<s> For example please look at the list of recent XQuery publications listed on the public home page [1].  </s>
<s> While this demonstrates there are others that agree with your desire for introductory material it also indicates that they think it is possible to do this sort of work outside of the WG (and outside of the W3C).  </s>
<s> So for the foreseeable future I am going to encourage the WG to concentrate on getting the XQuery specifications into Last Call and will depend on resources outside of the W3C to provide the kind of primer information you want.  </s>

<s> Hi Paul, Thanks for the response.  </s>
<s> With all due respect the references located at the URL which you give are predominantly either (at this point in time) vapourware, outdated or inappropriate to the audience which would benefit from a primer.  </s>
<s> For example, XQuery Early Adopter was written based on a Q3 2001 WD and was already out of date by its publication in January 2002.  </s>
<s> Pity the newcomer to XQuery who has to try to work out from that book what is still part of XQuery and what is now of merely historical curiosity.  </s>
<s> I don't think that I suggested or implied that the XQuery WG would be the *only* source of introductory XQuery material.  </s>
<s> It remains my view that an XQuery Primer produced by the XQuery WG would be of benefit to the hopefully emerging XQuery community.  </s>
<s> I hope that in time you will come to agree with that view.  </s>
<s> Regards Andrew Watt  </s>
<s> Hi Andrew, I agree that it would be of benefit.  </s>
<s> However, I also think that the editors need to be working on the core documents right now, and that the XQuery 1.0 document and the Use Cases already give people a reasonably approachable entry to the language, with lots of concrete examples.  </s>
<s> We need to get the standard done.  </s>
<s> It's a question of where you allocate the effort.  </s>
<s> I don't think the Working Group's time should be taken up with a primer at this point.  </s>
<s> You will almost certainly see up-to-date tutorials when the language stops changing and the tutorials can be stable.  </s>
