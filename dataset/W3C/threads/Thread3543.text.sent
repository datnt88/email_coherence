Hi Steve, It was a pleasure to meet you at the TechPlenary. 
This is a ping just to start the conversation between the WS coordination group and the I18N WG, Web Services Task Force. 
We've been hard at work on Usage Scenarios and Requirements documents, which we hope to advance to Note status soon. 
Some of our work is likely to serve as the basis of future i18n work on Web services or infrastructure that impacts Web services. 
As we discussed, sometime in the near future I'd like to do a presentation of our work, findings, and plans to the coordination group. 
Let me know how you'd like to proceed. 
Best Regards, Addison Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods | Delivering Global Business Visibility Chair, W3C Internationalization (I18N) Working Group Chair, W3C-I18N-WG, Web Services Task Force Internationalization is an architecture.

Addison, I have been swamped with work lately (since the Plenary). 
I'm on holiday now but I would like to schedule a time to talk about how to move on i18N with the Web Services Coordination call. 
Perhaps one way to do this is to invite you to address the chair on that call with a call to arms. 
Anyway let me know when you are free to talk. 
I'm back next week.

Hi Steve, That's great. 
I know that we'd love to have the opportunity to address the WSCG. 
I'm not sure of the timing. 
Personally, I'll be travelling Monday/Tuesday of this coming week, but that isn't necessarily an impediment to our discussing timing and other details. 
Under separate cover I'm sending you my contact information (I don't really want my phone numbers archived....) I hope you are enjoying your holiday. 
We'll chat soon.
