AC put in a proposal on looking at an evaluation of keyboard-only access in Windows. 
WL proposal on tips &amp; tricks, importance of getting input from the clientele. 
JB there were a number of sessions at CSUN on Web access; WL submission dates for almost everything on the list has passed. 
2) Preparation of FAQ for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines JB "in the event that" WCAG becomes a recommendation: planning 3-part release to include a FAQ. - Nominations for key questions to go on the FAQ? 
(&amp; nominations for key answers to answer the key questions?) SS how stable are the guidelines AC how often are the guidelines updated CMN why are they important AC who benefits from accessibility HB why are there so many different kinds of guidelines, how are they interrelated SS who's the target audience AC what's the most important to understand in terms of making a site accessible SS what are some of the EO initiatives that support this CMN where is the demonstration site MRK will it make it different for other users AC what are the most common accessibility errors/ barriers that Web sites contain WL how much does it cost AC what are the legal consequences of not making accessible pages? 
CMN how do I hire an accessibility surveyee DD are there tools that will help me SS why did you change the name GR are accessible sites necessarily dull sites HB where can I see examples JB who's doing this that I can look at AC what is the role of W3C in this [switched to brainstorming resources] GR tap into a company that provides software or services JB eg work with content development companies GR dynamic software users. 
rather than going to Alaire about Cold Fusion, go to donatees, ask them to be models. 
CMN best not to sidestep the fact that they're working on thousands of different parts of their sites to get them accessible JB a major comporation, previously uninvolved in WAI, said last night that they are implementing a new policy to implement our guidelines across their corporation, but can't publicly commit until have their site more cleaned up; this may be a common issue because companies are concerned about public response; we need to be able to handle commitments like this in context of progress AC link to one component of their site for illustrative purposes JB would be good to have a small class of reliably accessible public site/ as a changeable resource over time, plus a list of companies saying "we will" GR combined EO/ER task force to review sites DD reporting tool needs work from Gerald to move it more rapidly HB raise an issue on whether Bobby should evaluate browser sniffing **CMN will check issue w/ GL [back to questions brainstorming] WL need my site be ugly? 
HB where does one learn more about accessibility issues and the WAI? 
GR where is a real-life institution that is making their commercial site accessible? 
[what about a WAI site FAQ?] JB should we also develop a FAQ for the WAI site itself? 
nominees for what key questions/answers? 
AC who are we? JB four stakeholder parties GR convergence of WAI technologies w/ other technologies... CD ROM, etc., ?? reviewing other technical work GR complexity &amp; interrelatedness of all the other parts JB ADD INTO OTHER FAQ: how does this relate to WAI's other work; AC working in these other areas: design for browser specifications; etc. 3) Keyboard-only access HB different browser packages have different mapping, would be easier if could cross-map. 
AC there are 600 potential keyboard shortcuts built into a standard keyboard. 
so many. 
techniques for using those. 
to facilitate or to wreck access. 
mnfrs of diff AT's will mix them up. 
wishing for standard assigning patterns. 
JB how much in our scope? 
in scope of UAWG? 
CMN wide problem. 
linux user, issue, emacs HB this is a bar to accessibility, we can point it out. 
JB not in EOWG scope; raise in UAWG. 
3) Reprints of literature stuffers &amp; quicktips HB need them for XML Europe/ stuffers HB "all visuals" should be "each visual" JB fix boldness "alt" &amp; "CSS" and will be updating the URL's for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on literature stuffer MRK ran into a problem with translation, some words are normal (images), others are techie jargon (applets). 
Should we be using more abstract terms, like "active elements"? 
JG those are exactly the kinds of problems should be running into when translating things. 
SS "active elements" not a good generalization GR keep it specific; active elements is much too broad 4) Next meetings: April 2, 9 , 16, 23, 30.

(although I like the other question too. 
Can I get extra credit?) (grin) Charles Minutes, EOWG meeting, March 26, 1999.

I read with teh comments with great interest and here are my comments here. 
The major problem i see implementing the WCAG is getting the contractors, managers and developers trained and up to speed. 
I am running a project now where I have an outside contractor that will design to the spec, but really is not familiar with it. 
I have introduced them to bobby, the html validator, WCAG and they and we have missed some things in the Qualit Assurance check. 
I am literally taking each page and showing to all our other developers and managers and showing them pwWebSpeak and Lynx and Bobby. 
Oh yea, i have my own responsibilties too. 
This project is a rapid appplication development and is to be turned in thrity days. 
Two major design changes have now impacted time allocated at the end to address testing and universal accessibility issues. 
Because the US Mint is somewhat operating as a commercial site (than the rest of the government) we need to be sharp and clever in the design. 
Plus we all inherited a poorly designed site and have been patching it - too many graphics used as borders and spacer gifs. 
We are going to need to train graphic artists, HTML coders and programmers on universal accessibility. 
This will take time WHILE WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND ADD to our regular site. 
Can we consider getting some training providers on board to start training people - like federal employees? 
Managers are looking at the bottom line and we help them reduce their costs to redesign. 
/rob This is a snippet from stella o'brien WAI does already have the services of people like Chuck Letourneau who is a training provider etc. for the Canadian government - and is the joint chair of PAGL, and a member of the WAI EO amongst others. 
I've seen Chuck's work and it is excellent, he also comes highly recommended by Cynthia Waddell of San Jose - talk to him about training needs and provision. 
My reply: Great news about chuck being a trainer. 
I was thinking more in line that WAI or EO would take the lead to establish training requirements or certifications. 
Think we need this before the opportunist and also the training company who need this become fragmented and dilute the meaning of the words, universally accessible.
