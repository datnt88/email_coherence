The listing for James Clark's test cases, the file xmltest/xmltest.xml, 
seems to be missing an entry for these test cases: - xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/010.xml - xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/011.xml Karl Thank you for your comments. 
We will be reviewing them and making appropriate changes.

Just asking since no-one replied.

We will get back to you on those.
