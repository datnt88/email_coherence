Last example fn:string-join is wrong: ancestor-or-self::* is a reverse axis so result would be section/chap/doc. 
Either fix the result or add a /. at the end of the path expression. 
No, the result of an AxisStep is always in forwards document order.

It is also an XPath 2.0-only example and should be marked as such.

The example is wrong, however, because it uses the expression "name(.)" when it should use "name($n)". 
The current example would return "section/section/section" since "name(.)" 
always returns "section". 
The corrected example is: fn:string-join(for $n in ancestor-or-self::* return name($n), '/') 
If we can't have a "for" expression that binds the context item, I really do think that as a minimum, a "for" expression should unbind ".", so that this all-too-common error gets detected.

Michael: Thank you for your comment. 
As responses to this mail have confirmed, the result of the example is correct. 
I have fixed the bug in the return clause and marked the example as an XPath 2.0 example. 
All the best, Ashok
