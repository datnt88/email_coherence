<s> I have created an on-line survey and trying to test with JAWS.  </s>
<s> I used radio buttons for all the multiple choice questions.  </s>
<s> When I am in forms mode, JAWS repeats the question when I move from one option to the other.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to stop JAWS repeting the question when I move from one option to the other?  </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do in html to force JAWS to read the question only once?  </s>
<s> Thank You.  </s>

<s> Hello, If you use JAWS 4.02, it is probably the way that JAWS reads legend of fieldset.  </s>
<s> It's a good way I think.  </s>
<s> Before, JAWS did'nt read legend and the question was not read to the user in form mode.  </s>
<s> He has always to alternate between form mode on and off.  </s>

<s> If this survey uses the fieldset, JAWS 4.02 ties the reading of that to what they call the groupbox in their verbosity settings.  </s>
<s> You can either turn the speaking of this on or off but as far as I know at present there's not a read once per group setting as you arrow between different radio buttons.  </s>
