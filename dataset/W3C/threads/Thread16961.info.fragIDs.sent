I have created an on-line survey and trying to test with JAWS. 
I used radio buttons for all the multiple choice questions. 
When I am in forms mode, JAWS repeats the question when I move from one option to the other. 
Is there a way to stop JAWS repeting the question when I move from one option to the other? 
Is there anything I can do in html to force JAWS to read the question only once? 
Thank You.

Hello, If you use JAWS 4.02, it is probably the way that JAWS reads legend of fieldset. 
It's a good way I think. 
Before, JAWS did'nt read legend and the question was not read to the user in form mode. 
He has always to alternate between form mode on and off.

If this survey uses the fieldset, JAWS 4.02 ties the reading of that to what they call the groupbox in their verbosity settings. 
You can either turn the speaking of this on or off but as far as I know at present there's not a read once per group setting as you arrow between different radio buttons.
