<s> Sent: Sunday, April 22, 2001 5:42 PM Subject: Component instead of Configuration/Baseline/Component Hi, I know that it's late and probably Geoff is busy rewriting 14.1 to produce 15, but nevertheless here I have a proposal which would make some concepts easier to understand IMHO.  </s>
<s> In 11 (Baseline feature) a couple of new terms appear: Configuration, meaning a tree of resources rooted at a root (:-) collection, a technical term.  </s>
<s> Baseline, a technical term which probably is just there because the feature is called like that, because basically it's just another word for 'configuration version' Components, a logical term which is used to rationalize subbaselines.  </s>
<s> So I would like to introduce just one new term: Component.  </s>
<s> And define it like the old Configuration (So Configuration disappears) Instead BASELINE-CONTROL use COMPONENT-CONTROL.  </s>
<s> The necessity for Baseline disappears.  </s>
<s> It's just a 'component version'.  </s>
<s> Subbaseline-set becomes subcomponent-set and so on.  </s>
<s> A 'Component feature' would show better I think what we want to gain than 'Baseline feature'.  </s>
<s> So the beginning could e.g. be: 11 COMPONENT FEATURE A "component" is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all menbers of that root collection which aren't a component themselves.  </s>
<s> ... This would just be a (Not so small I admit) editorial change.  </s>
<s> No different functionality.  </s>
<s> I hope I didn't miss something you can't do if you drop Configuration and Baseline.  </s>

<s> Actually, I got the "dates" a bit wrong when I updated the deltav page (those dates are entered by hand to the html page)... but after I noticed it, I figured it was close enough (at least the month was right).  </s>

<s> Yes, I am neutral.  </s>
<s> I believe Jim Amsden was the only one who responded so far (and he wanted to keep it "configuration", because "component" is so overused as a term).  </s>
<s> Just to expand a bit on my "neutrality", on one hand, the term "configuration" emphasizes the fact that it is "a set of things", but on the other hand, the term "component" emphasizes the fact that this is something you can plug in and plug out, which is exactly what you do when you create and select different baselines for a baselined collection.  </s>
<s> So on a purely technical basis, I probably prefer the term "component", but on an inertial basis (i.e. we've been calling it a configuration for a while now, and people seem OK with it), I prefer the term "configuration".  </s>
<s> So, either way is fine with me (:-).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> FWIW I'm similarly indifferent to the term used.  </s>
