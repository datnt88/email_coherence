Hi, I'm trying to figure how I would be able to access schema information, like ASElementDecl, from a DOM Element node. 
There doesn't seem to be a way from the ElementEditAS either... 
Also, is there a default AS model that defines all the links between the schema datatypes; for example, is there a way to know that the parent type of xs:string is xs:anySimpleType. 
Is there this default type hierarchy information available? 
I can only see the all the schema datatypes are defined as enumerations, but no info on the type hierarchy. 
Thanks for any info! Martin Tapp I have to say I find the whole abstract schemas approach to be woefully lacking in basic functionality. 
There really should be some sort of getType() method on Element, Attr, and perhaps Node that returns some representation of the DTD type and possibly the schema type. 
Details could be worked out (Two separate methods for DTD and schema types or just one? 
Which interfaces to put this on? 
How are types represented? 
etc.) but first there'd need to be a recognition from the DOM group that this is an important requirement that AS as currently designed simply does not solve.

| You'd need the PSVI/AS functionality to do this. 
No, you'd need PSVI/AS.
