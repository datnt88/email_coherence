Hi everyone. 
I am facing this problem with meta tags when I am trying to convert html to xml. 
[Fatal Error] :52:8: The element type "meta" must be terminated by the matching end-tag " /meta ". error in extraction process! 
can anyone tell me what i should do? 
what config file setting should i use? 
thank you very much. 
Best Regards, ray Ray, I'm no Tidy guru but you could try this (I am assuming you are aware that option: 'output-xml' must be true). 
Use the 'new tag' options adding 'meta' to each one like this: new-blocklevel-tags: meta new-empty-tags: meta new-inline-tags: meta new-pre-tags: meta It's possible only one of these needs to be set. 
I know not which one. 
Doing this sorted out similar problems I was having with the 'script' tag using TidyCOM. 
Like I said this may not work but give it a go anyway. 
Regards, ..matthew Use the -asxml option to convert HTML to XHTML. 
Use the -asxml -n options to convert HTML to XHTML with numeric entities instead of named entities, which would need to be defined if you intend to use the XHTML file with XML tools (browers understand the named entities even when you use XHTML). 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net 
Or -output-xhtml with the Sourceforge code base. 
So do XML tools when you use the proper DOCTYPE declaration. 
No need to use -n for XHTML. 
/Jelks Where is this error message from? 
It's certainly not HTML Tidy, it doesn't have a "fatal error"... By the way, ReportEncodingError uses the FatalError function, it shouldn't do so, FatalError is only for fatal fatal fatal errors like a failing malloc(). 
Who ever added this should please fix it, thanks.
