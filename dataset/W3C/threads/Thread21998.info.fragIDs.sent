<s> Why is the DOM working group waiting for the CR to develop a test suite for DOM Level 3? Don't you think it could be valuable to work on the test suite  </s>

<s> Who said the DOM Working Group will wait to develop a test suite for DOM Level 3? My message was only about the DOM Conformance work, not the DOM Working Group.  </s>
