Hi, I installed the JavaScript interface to Annotea and I keep getting the following JavaScript error when I try using it: JavaScript Error: access disallowed from scripts at [unknown origin] to documents at another domain. 
Do you know why is this happening? 
Thanks, Marius 
No I haven't seen that error but I'm willing to investigate. 
What client/browser are you using? 
Have you turned off cookies? 
When you attempt to retrieve annotations, what username are you using? 
Have you tried using the Amaya client to access annotations? 
If so, does it work OK? Art 
You probably need to check your browser's security settings.
