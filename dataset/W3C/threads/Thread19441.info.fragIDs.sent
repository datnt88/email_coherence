<s> Hi, I know it's not the kind of questions than developpers like to be asked but i work with Amaya &amp; Thot for a time now (couple of month) and i don't find what i'm looking for by my own.  </s>
<s> My questions are: How can i obtain up to date description of the API.  </s>
<s> Can i use Cextract to do it?  </s>
<s> if yes how?  </s>
<s> if no, does it exist something who can help me?  </s>
<s> Where i can find description of the new feature added to Structure language, presentation language ...? Some time it's hard to figure what do the new keyword in the grammar.  </s>
<s> I appreciate to know about any source of information, i already browse the amaya and thot Web site, thot ftp site and mailing lists.  </s>
<s> Did i miss something ?  </s>
<s> Merci beaucoup!  </s>

<s> The up to date description of the API is located at and http://opera.inrialpes.fr/thot/doc/APIman.html The up to description of Thot languages is located at Perhaps we miss out to document some functions.  </s>
<s> In any case all API functions are listed and documented in the include files Thot/thotlib/include/*.h and language grammars are defined in Thot/batch/*.LAN In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 03 Sep 1998 17:27:50 -0400."  </s>

<s> Hi Sorry, i think i was not enough clear with my question.  </s>
<s> I took stuff in the lastest version of amaya and look what i got when i compare the new grammar with the old: (0)gagnon@---:~/Thot/batch diff STRUCT.LAN /usr/batch/STRUCT.LAN 131,133c131 'ReturnCreateNL' / 'IsTable' / 'IsRow' / 'IsColHead' / 'IsCell' / 'NewPercentWidth' / 'ColRef' / 'ColSpan' / 'RowSpan' /  </s>
<s> 'ReturnCreateNL' /  </s>
<s> This is new exceptions ... and the documents you pointed me was not update to reflect this change.  </s>
<s> That is the same thing with the createwith statement (in older version of the library) in P language... i did not find any functional description.  </s>
<s> I have no example for API .. but i suppose it can be the same thing:) These are only examples... and i understand a lot of them, but some takes me time to figure for what they was made for.  </s>
<s> I suppose this stuff is not documented but i ask .. in case of something exist For the API i will compose my own document with stuff in Thot/thotlib/include/*.h thanks.  </s>
