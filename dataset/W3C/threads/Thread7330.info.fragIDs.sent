<s> Here is the preliminary access control requirements draft.  </s>
<s> This is based on some of the general consensus reached here on the list: 1) Treating security policies as a resource was popular; 2) Not including issues pertaining to authentication, auditing and encryption were favored; 3) The methods should work within the framework of HTTP 1.1 as extended by WebDAV.  </s>

<s> Proposed Requirements for Access Control within Distributed Authoring and Versioning Environments on the WWW * * * Proposed Draft * * * [Standard Document format and jargon to be done] 1.0 Abstract To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within a distributed World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary to furnish a methodology which controls access to objects.  </s>
<s> Access control may include the ability to read an object, modify an object, or perform other more advanced functions upon an object.  </s>
<s> Access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access or modification of objects within the authoring environment which could lead to unintended loss, damage or disclosure of data.  </s>
<s> This document describes functionality which could be incorporated within the existing HTTP framework [1] to provide standardized methods which would allow Web Servers, Web Applications and Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning Tools (WebDAV) to exchange and process information regarding access controls.  </s>
<s> 2.0 Rationale The IDC report, "The Intranet's Many Faces" [2] points to "Central Administration of user access rights and restrictions" as an essential benefit of Web-based technology.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this fundamental requirement has not been standardized.  </s>
<s> Existing Web Server and Authoring Tool implementations do not have an interoperable mechanism for assigning access control information to a particular resource or requesting access control information about a particular resource.  </s>
<s> Present access control mechanisms, including native-operating system methods and Web-based htaccess mechanisms do not adequately address the need for managing the modification of documents within a distributed authoring environment.  </s>
<s> Native operating system methods are ineffective because the users responsible for modifying information on the Web site are generally not logged in interactively to the server in a manner that maps their identity to a local user-id.  </s>
<s> Further, there are significant differences between access control implementations on different operating systems which make it difficult or impossible to create standardized authoring tools that recognize access control information on different platforms.  </s>
<s> The "htaccess" file utilized on many Web Servers today deals principally with read permission, and is unsuitable for the more complex access control issues that exist in the distributed authoring environment.  </s>
<s> In addition, authoring tools need to the ability to assign permissions to particular resources from within the authoring environment.  </s>
<s> To have a reasonable level of management, it is necessary to both read and query for access control information within the framework of the proposed HTTP standard.  </s>
<s> This document describes requirements for a set of methods which could be implemented within the framework of the proposed HTTP standard for the following: Creation and modification of security policies Assignment of security policies to resources Querying for policy information on a resource Types of standard access control types  </s>
<s> This document also specifies the principles that WebDAV-compliant Web Server products should adhere to when dealing with resources bound by security policies.  </s>
<s> This will produce a consistent expectation as to the behavior of access control attributes that WebDAV applications can depend upon.  </s>
<s> 3. Terminology Terminology is intended to be consistent with that specified in the Internet Draft "Requirements for Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide Web" [3].  </s>
<s> In addition, the following terms are used within this document: Access Policy A resource which contains information about who and under what conditions a particular access is allowed or denied.  </s>
<s> Access Attribute An attribute that relates a specified type of access with a named access policy.  </s>
<s> Web Application A type of resource which may have dynamic output and has the ability to interact with users.  </s>
<s> A CGI (Command Gateway Interface) [4] program is an example of a Web Application.  </s>
<s> There are now numerous other means of implementating Web Applications than CGI.  </s>
<s> 4. General Principles This section describes a set of general principles that WebDAV-compliant access control systems should follow in addition to the principles set forth as overall WevDAV principles [3].  </s>
<s> 4.1 Abstraction of Security Implementation The structure internal to Access Policy resources is not defined.  </s>
<s> This is to allow the implementors of Web Servers and applications maximum flexibility in identifying the relationship between users, resources and their access capabilities.  </s>
<s> Standardizing the type of information that might be allowed within an access policy at this point could prematurely limit the ability to create complex access control rules.  </s>
<s> 4.2 Open User Authentication It should not be a requirement that a particular user authentication method be used.  </s>
<s> How users are identified and authenticated and how they relate to stated Access Policy resources should be handled within the Web Server or Web Application implementation.  </s>
<s> However, certain recommended methods for user authentication may be suggested.  </s>
<s> Similarly, issues pertaining to user lists, user list management and how a particular user is integrated with access policy is left to the Web Server implementation.  </s>
<s> 5.0 Requirements Standardized attributes must be provided for the purpose of associating access control information with individual resources.  </s>
<s> This section covers how access attributes should be implemented.  </s>
<s> 5.1 Setting of Access Attributes The setting of access attributes must be handled through the same protocol that is used to query and specify other attribute data [2].  </s>
<s> 5.1.1  </s>
<s> Rationale WebDAV already intends to specify the means to set and query metadata.  </s>
<s> Since access control information is really just another type of metadata, there is no apparent reason to produce new ways to tackle this problem.  </s>
<s> 5.2 Access Inheritance It must be possible to assign an access attribute to a collection (such as a directory).  </s>
<s> By default, resources contained in a collection must inherit access attributes from their parent resource.  </s>
<s> 5.2.1 Rationale Inheritance of security information between directories and files within most file systems behave in this manner.  </s>
<s> This promotes an orthagonal implementation on the Web.  </s>
<s> 5.3 Reporting to Web Applications There must be a standard mechanism for reporting changes to access attributes to Web Applications so that they can take any special internal actions that might be appropriate for them.  </s>
<s> It must be possible for the Web Application to report back its acceptance or advisory refusal of the access attribute change.  </s>
<s> 5.3.1  </s>
<s> Rationale Changing of access attributes on a static resource such as an HTML document is relatively straightforward.  </s>
<s> However, Web Applications may wish to know that access control data has changes, because they may need to update their internal information.  </s>
<s> This is an attempt to provide for an object-oriented view of how resources can provide for their own access control when they are capable of doing so.  </s>
<s> 5.4 Access Control to Access Policies Since access policies are themselves a resource, they can in turn be controlled by other access policy resources.  </s>
<s> 5.4.1 Rationale This is intended to make it simple to administrate changes to access policy information.  </s>
<s> 5.5 Standard Access Attributes This section enumerates the access control attributes that must be available in any WebDAV implementation.  </s>
<s> It is acceptable if some implementations wish to treat different access attributes as synonymous (e.g., a change to the attribute controlling "list" access may simultaneously change both "list" and "read").  </s>
<s> 5.5.1 Rationale A set of standard access attributes will facilitate the creation of interoperable tools that will make it easier to change or query for access control information.  </s>
<s> Further, by standardizing on certain types of access control methods, we will promote a more orthagonal implementation upon which tools and users can base their expectations.  </s>
<s> 5.5.2 List A standard access attribute must be provided that governs what happens when the user wishes to list the contents of a collection or confirm the existance of a particular resource.  </s>
<s> 5.5.2.1 Rationale Experience with file systems has shown that unauthorized access or attempts at circumventing security policies increase when users have more information about the contents of the file system.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it is helpful to define an access control attribute that controls whether a user can obtain this information about a particular resource.  </s>
<s> 5.5.3 Read-when-unlocked A standard access attribute must be provided that controls access to the object when it is in an "unlocked" state.  </s>
<s> 5.5.3.1 Rationale Some resource may contain confidential or sensitive information.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to limit whether a particular user is allowed to read the contents of a resource.  </s>
<s> "Unlocked" versus "locked" states are split to allow the possibility of allowing certain users to read a resource despite an advisory lock.  </s>
<s> 5.5.4 Read-when-locked A standard access attribute must be provided that controls access to that object when it is in a "locked" state.  </s>
<s> It is recommended that the default access control behavior be to deny access to read the resource except by the owner of the lock.  </s>
<s> 5.5.5 Modify A standard access attribute must be provided that controls access to modify the contents of the object.  </s>
<s> Implementations should check the lock status and apply the appropriate read-when-locked or read-when-unlocked access control policy prior to any modification attempt.  </s>
<s> 5.5.5.1 Rationale Experience with a wide number of information systems has shown that different users need the ability to modify different resources.  </s>
<s> 5.5.6 Delete A standard access attribute must be provided that governs what happens when a user wishes to delete a resource.  </s>
<s> 5.5.6.1 Rationale Experience with file systems has shown that it is sometimes preferable to permit certain users to modify a particular resource without allowing them to delete it.  </s>
<s> 5.5.7 Change-access-policy A standard access attribute must be provided that governs what happens when a user wishes to change an access attribute on a resource.  </s>
<s> 5.5.7.1 Rationale Experience with file systems has shown that there is a significant desire to separate the management of information content (what is contained within the resources when a user reads it) from the manage of access control structure.  </s>
<s> Often, different people in different roles are responsible for these capabilities, and it may compromise the intended security plan to allow users to change access control information about a resource even if they are normally allowed to change or delete it.  </s>
<s> 6.0 Security This document generally deals with the issue of access control, which is a fundamental security issue.  </s>
<s> However, this document raises other security concerns that implementors may wish to consider.  </s>
<s> For example, this requirements document does not deal with issues pertaining to the integrity of a request to change an access control attribute to a different access policy.  </s>
<s> It is assumed that issues of spoofing, impersonating users, data integrity and encryption are suitably dealt with elsewhere and that nothing within the access control requirements preclude these techniques.  </s>

<s> Thank you for writing up this preliminary access control requirements draft!  </s>
<s> Some comments I have are below:  </s>
<s> I think it's important to keep a good separation of term usage between "security," which many in the Web community view as "how to keep to protocol stream safe from snooping," and "access control," which is what you're talking about here.  </s>
<s> I know access control is about keeping your data secure, but to avoid terminological overload, we should stick to access control.  </s>
<s> I prefer the term, "data producing process," which is used in RFC 2068, over "web application," which is a little broad for this meaning -- after all, a Web browser is a Web application too.  </s>
<s> There is a real tension between this, and wanting to give a specification for what a policy object is.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that leaving this unspecified gives enough information for an interoperable solution.  </s>
<s> I definitely feel uncomfortable with this as a general principle.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I find that this is blurring the line between requirements and design.  </s>
<s> The requirement I see in this paragraph is: It must be possible to set access control permissions on a resource.  </s>
<s> The design decision embodied here is: Access control permissions should be stored in a metadata item.  </s>
<s> This is design rationale.  </s>
<s> I like this.  </s>
<s> OK, this confused me.  </s>
<s> Since these requirements should be focusing exclusively on what facilities can be specified over the wire between a client and a server, I think this doesn't belong in the requirements document, since this is a internal server issue.  </s>
<s> There are really two requirements here: 1) access policies must be stored in a resource 2) the req't listed above However, #1 above somewhat goes against your design intention of using attributes to store access control, since the most recent metadata draft has metadata being part of the state of the resource it describes (links still exist, though, so a separate access control resource can still be linked to a resource)  </s>
<s> If you have separate access rights for read and for confirm the existence of a resource, how do they interact?  </s>
<s> Persumably if I can read a resource, it exists, and this is a confirmation of its existence.  </s>
<s> Even though this is probably aimed at the scenario I brough up about reducing access to a resource while editing is taking place, I suspect it would be wise to keep access control and locking as separate as possible.  </s>
<s> So I'd rather see a "read" permission, than the "read locked" and "read unlocked" permissions.  </s>
<s> If access control permissons are stored in a resource, then that resource is subject to the "modify" access right, and hence there wouldn't be a separate access permission for access permission resources.  </s>
<s> That said, I think it makes sense to keep this requirement.  </s>
<s> I've always thought that the easiest approach for access control on the Web would be to create a matrix of: {resource x HTTP method x {list of principals}} So, one entry might be: /jon/index.html  </s>
<s> GET *any* /jon/index.html  </s>
<s> PUT jradoff The most important concept for this document being the exact 1:1 correspondence between methods and access lists.  </s>
<s> Some of your categories cut across several HTTP methods, and I'm not sure that's a good thing.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there should be requirements like: Each HTTP method must have separate access permissions (excepting maybe TRACE and OPTIONS).  </s>
<s> But, since I like the grouping idea: A mechanism for grouping related methods into a more abstract, named access control permission must be available.  </s>
<s> This way different access control schemes can be described using the same primitives (which are HTTP methods).  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I think that specifying that the access attributes must inherit from the parent resource will require us to specify too many details regarding the semantics of changing the permissions of the various resources (eg what happens to the children's access attributes when we change those of the parent).  </s>
<s> I think this should be restated as  </s>
<s> "5.2 It must be possible to assign an access attribute to a collection (such as a directory).  </s>
<s> The system must assign appropriate default access attributes to resources added to a collection."  </s>
<s> 5.5.3 and 5.5.4  </s>
<s> I don't see the necessity for splitting between locked and unlocked resources when it comes to access control.  </s>
<s> It must be possible to access a resource for reading when it is locked I would argue in favour of the default action being to allow read access to locked resources.  </s>
<s> Hmm. I think I like this even better than the original requirement -- I think this provides a good tradeoff between wanting to assign individual access permissions to resources, but still have some way for a resource to receive its initial, default permissions.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Hmm. I think I like this even better than the original requirement -- I think this provides a good tradeoff between wanting to assign individual access permissions to resources, but still have some way for a resource to receive its initial, default permissions.  </s>
<s> I like this better also, I must admit there is a good point raised about the potential complexity.  </s>
<s> Having the inheritance provide defaults (or some similar scheme) seems a good tradeoff to me as well... -=jack=- (This text composed by voice)  </s>
