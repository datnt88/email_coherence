<s> Yes, you have to modify the SGML declaration (just as you would to allow OMITTAG or any other optional feature not directly supported by XML).  </s>
<s> This is a workaround, but one that is generally available, easy to implement, and for which no great barriers exist in the XML spec.  </s>
<s> In other words, it's a trival NSGMLS application to take as input a valid XML document and an LPD and produce as output a well-formed XML document that includes the ICADD attributes.  </s>
<s> In fact, adding this feature to any SP- or NSGMLS-based SGML-to-WFXML generator is as simple as recognizing LINK attributes in addition to instance attributes.  </s>
<s> I would therefore suggest that anyone thinking of writing such a tool include support for putting LINK attributes in the instance.  </s>
<s> Note that this is really easy if the output is wellformed but not valid, because you don't have to worry about modifying the document type.  </s>
<s> If you want to produce valid XML documents then you have to update the relevant attribute lists, which is a bit more difficult (but not impossible using something like Earl Hood's DTD processing Perl scripts).  </s>

<s> What Steve says is, of course, true, but it somewhat misses the point of using LINK in this case, which is that LINK allows such attributes to be added to documents unilaterally, without the need to modify the document  </s>

<s> It also makes it possible to use a wide range of architectures with a documents without overloading each element with a long list of always-there fixed attributes.  </s>
<s> For ICADD, I think every document type intended to be used for documents that will have visually-impaired readers should include the ICADD architectural attributes in particular, but we can't count on it.  </s>
<s> I also suspect that once the use of architectures becomes more widespread, which I think it will once the HyTime TC is published and people start to understand the power that's there, that users will start to see how LINK, at least in its simple #IMPLICIT form, can be of real benefit and that, as a result, vendors will start to add support for it.  </s>
<s> Given that both SoftQuad and ADEPT have to rework their editors to allow element declarations in internal subsets anyway, it can't be that much more effort to support implicit link at the same time.  </s>
<s> I can't imagine that it would be hard for the DynaText parser to add support for LINK either (if it's Yasp or SP, it's already there or mostly there).  </s>
<s> However, my point was that, as a delivery mechanism, software that supports LINK sufficiently exists and can be used to easily build the necessary filters.  </s>

<s> Although that new XML instance could be provided as a special case output of some application, an objective I believe we should have is that any XML application should make easy the inclusion of ICADD support.  </s>
<s> Some believe that LINK is the way to include ICADD.  </s>
<s> By that argument, W3C removed the support for the #FIXED SDA attributes from the HTML 3.2 DTD.  </s>
<s> Getting support for LINK presumes that some external pressure, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, is sufficient to encourage vendors to supply support for the LINK feature that is not now well-supported.  </s>
<s> Such pressure has influenced Microsoft, and Adobe in other areas of accessibility.  </s>
<s> I hope that XML will facilitate inclusion of ICADD capabilities.  </s>
<s> That appears to be needed, as a minimum.  </s>
<s> The support that goes behind it is also needed.  </s>
<s> I believe that the LINK capability to support hierarchy-dependent distinctions is important.  </s>
<s> Being able to determine where one is in context is much harder for someone who must depend on memory, without visual cues.  </s>
<s> Also, when one uses search to jump to a pattern match, the context of the result is not evident, without a means to determine that context.  </s>
<s> I believe Murray's experiments using LINK are an essential step before any decision on how to bring ICADD up to date can be made.  </s>
<s> At this time, we should not preclude the use of LINK from XML.  </s>

<s> tragedy.  </s>
<s> I'm still ramping up on these issues, but I would venture that XML offers a much better solution than the current ICADD for those who need ICADD's benefits.  </s>
<s> XML is about sending intelligent markup that correctly models its data all the way down to the client applications.  </s>
<s> So through style sheet mechanisms (DSSSL, for example), couldn't a publisher provide those with disabilities a much more robust set of guidelines, custom-tailored to the smarts of the content set, to help those with disabilities differentiate parts of documents?  </s>
<s> Doesn't the world of style sheets offer a far greater avenue for opening access than hiding hints inside a DTD?  </s>
<s> Instead of just prefixes and suffixes, a content provider could call for much more useful annotations/transformations/inflection-changes.  </s>

<s> You might well be right.  </s>
<s> One discussion was about the use of LINK for adding ICADD SDA forms to the HTML 3.2 DTD.  </s>
<s> I am still not convinced that this is a good idea.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, none of the major HTML browsers today will cope very well with an SGML declaration in a document, let alone a link process definition.  </s>
<s> Presumably !USELINK... would become legal within an HTML document.  </s>
<s> Introducing LINK into HTML could have interesting implications for CSS1 and also for anchors -- it gives you a way of doing something very like a HyTime ILINK (but restricted to pointing to entire elements).  </s>
<s> But given that HTML applications today don't (in generl) even support document-specific entities, it would seem to me better not to extend HTML in this way, but to use existing technology.  </s>
<s> If you want to have the ICADD attributes in a separate file, assume that the SGML 97 rule has passed to allow !AttList X a "b" #IMPLIED percy (x|y|z) "x" !AttList X c "d" #FIXED so that you can put all the #FIXED attributes (and maybe others) in a separate file and include it from the base DTD.  </s>
<s> Alan's comment:  </s>
<s> Is a good one.  </s>
<s> LINK was an early (and I think unsuccessful) attempt to provide a general transformation model for SGML.  </s>
<s> This has since been done in DSSSL.  </s>
<s> It would be better to supply a DSSSL transformation than a LINK process definition set file, I think.  </s>
<s> It is unlikely that existing vendors will start to support LINK.  </s>
<s> It is very likely that they will support DSSSL.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, as far as I can tell from reading 8879, an SGML application can ignore LINK if it wants to.  </s>
<s> The information is a hint to the parser, no more.  </s>
<s> I don't have a formal definition of ESIS in front of me, so don't know if ESIS is required to be changed by LINK.  </s>
<s> So maybe HTML software could conform if it ignored the LPD.  </s>
<s> But I am not sure if that helps anyone.  </s>
<s> Since the issues are political and not technical, I don't think I can comment further.  </s>
