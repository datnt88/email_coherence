Our present title for the ERT document is Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines This note is to start a thread on possibly revising the title. 
Some thoughts- Current title seems to say we're evaluating the guidelines. 
Also, I don't see that we're "implementing" the guidelines. 
The authors are following the guidelines. 
Here's a suggestion to get started: "Techniques for evaluating and improving accessibility of web pages" Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Department of Electrical Engineering Temple University 423 Ritter Annex, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org 
(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) LK:: "Techniques for evaluating and improving accessibility of web pages" WL: I think that's the title for a WCAG techniques document, not an E&amp;R document. 
I could be wrong g . 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Sentence version suggestion: Techniques for evaluating, repairing, and transforming accessibility of web content... Title version suggestion: "Accessibility Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation of Web Content" [AERT]) Regards, Phill Jenkins this was a thread a couple weeks ago. 
I kept track of the suggested titles in the open issues list [available at suggestions: 1. Techniques for evaluation and repair of Web content 2. Evaluation and Repair tool accessibility guidelines 3. Techniques for automatic implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 4. Techniques for evaluation and repair of *accessible* web content 5. Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools we can add to that Phil's suggestion: 6. Accessibility Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation of Web Content" [AERT]) Therefore, I don't think we're lacking suggestions, but rather consensus on one of the suggestions, unless someone else wants to add something to the mix.

Techniques for evaluating accessibility of web content, and repairing or transforming such content with an eye to improving its accessibility. 
Dear list members, An important goal of Guidelines is, that these guidelines are used by web designers and the industry. 
I spoke with a lot of webmasters and web designers here in the Netherlands who find it difficult "where to start" and asked me if there was not any translation of these guidelines. 
Are there any plans for translations?
