I have published a document summarizing the list discussion on the checkpoints with low implementation experience[1]. 
Please review the list and send comments before today's meeting.

list 5.7 is implemented in "hybrid UA's" such as browser+proximitron, or my own Snufkin. 
Whilst this is perhaps not sufficient it does show that it is pretty workable. 
Jim. 
This is a good opportunity to remind everyone that the approach taken by UAAG 1.0 is that combinations of software can conform. 
The conformance claim indicates what pieces work together to satisfy the various requirements. 
So the combinations you cite do help us in our effort to show implementability. 
We welcome additional reports of how products working together satisfy the checkpoints. 
Thank you, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

Snufkin also implements 3.5, 5.3, 5.5 and I have "tried" 10.5 but never had something that "worked". 
Jim.
