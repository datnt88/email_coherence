I?m here because I?m lazy. 
I don?t like having to do work twice ? 
different conditional markup and scripting for different browsers. 
I live and work in the U.K. and have both professional and personal interests in websites. 
Having become aware of the Web Standards movement through WaSP a couple of years ago I?m trying to apply this philosophy to both work and home sites. 
At home I can play as I like, at work I am faced with a committee or two and specifications that are not open, and a narrow subset of browsers used for testing. 
It was the realisation that my existing sites were not suitable for use by people with visual difficulties that made me stop and reassess what I was doing and how I could improve matters. 
The writing of an educational site for someone else (a charity) made me realise that it was sea change that was needed. 
For this I?m concentrating on blindness and colour blindness as a start. 
The RNIB (UK sight organisation) has been helpful in providing guidelines for some of this. 
So my aims are to write everything in XHTML 1.1 using CSS and minimal client side scripting ? 
I?ll have to use server side scripting using PHP to access MySQL ? 
and display results in non-conformant browsers (e.g. NS4 series) with a warning message. 
I?ll test in Opera 6, IE,6, NS 7 and Moz 1 as there are the browser offering of the future, and also internet devices and mobiles as and when I can persuade my friends to see how sites look on theirs. 
I?ll also try to find speech browsers so that I can check that my sites make sense. 
Regards evangelism ? 
I?m in the middle of writing a personal site promoting Web Standards for the amateur site builder ? 
and trying to assist friends in making sites compliant. 
At work I am running education courses for Web Standards ? 
but I really need big guns to get on my side for this to have a real effect. 
And from this forum ? 
hopes that there are sufficient people contributing from the grass roots of web design rather than just the experts ? 
and one of the things I?m looking for is ideas on how best to promote standards and education material which is as good (or better) a quality as that already available for non-standards HTML. 
Above all we really need a consistent approach that can be followed, maybe by grading educational material already out in the public domain as suitable/not suitable for standards complaint education. 
Ramble over.

Im here because Im lazy. 
I'm here because this is a big job and every bit helps. 
Well, that is why the standards were created. 
I have never written a website for hire. 
All sites I create are standards-compliant and because I don't have to go through a review process, I can keep things simple, accessible, and admistratable. 
Hey, I haven't figured out if XHTML 1.1 is actually the latest HTML. 
Well, if you saw my other message, I want to complile a list of sites like this. 
I think a Evangelism day would be cool, similar to Bug days for Mozilla. 
We would write an article or something about the standards and submit it to as many places as possible. 
I learn from the actual specifications since most references are outdated or encourage presentational markup instead of semantic markup. 
Brant Langer Gurganus Don't complain about problems, solve them. 
I'm here because I love the web. 
It's wonderful how it is, but no-one has yet even begun to realise the potential of what we can do with this thing. 
If the web is going to keep evolving, it needs to do it based on a set of standards which everyone follows, which luckily seems to be the direction the tools, and quite a few of the authors are currently heading towards. 
As I become more involved with newer technologies, I'm finding a distinct lack of any decent documentation, suitable for the average person at all. 
If we do want to build the future's systems, I think that there needs to be better learning materials, and tools, such that it's easy for anyone to participate in it. 
Things like RSS are fine, but they don't become as powerful as they should be until everyone starts using them. 
I want to be one of those who joins in in being ahead of the pack, implementing new and cool stuff, and making sure everyone else is able to follow. 
Therefore, I want to see good powerful standards released, and I want to see people such as myself playing with them, figuring out what we can do with them, contributing towards making the next versions even better than the previous ones, and most importantly teaching those who haven't reached that level yet so that they can participate, and add to the tapestry that we're all building.

I'm only here for the beer. 
I'm Drew, and I work with the WaSP as part of their Dreamweaver Task Force. 
During the recent development of Dreamweaver MX, Rachel Andrew, myself and others from the WaSP worked alongside Macromedia to place gentle pressure and make good arguments for standards support. 
Macromedia listened and put loads of hard work in, and as a result Dreamweaver MX is a fine product with much improved standards support. 
Rachel is on this list too - I'm sure she'll introduce herself. 
My first book, Dreamweaver MX Web Development (New Riders) is due out next month. 
The book teaches standards-based web development with Dreamweaver as your tool. 
As you may have gathered, the Dreamweaver community is rife with designers and developers who often don't know how to operate their tools well, let alone markup a page against a valid DTD. 
There is a vast need for education, as well as the need for a strong counter-attack to the misinformation that is handed out by many of the community 'experts'. 
So that's about where I fit in. 
I'm a guy who believes in web standards, who knows Dreamweaver inside and out but never uses it, and who's keen to learn from those around me. 
It's great to be here, and I look forward to some good conversation.

Hi Alll.. I'll attach my introduction and I'll probably be lurking from here on out. 
I'm on the Women Designers list with Rachel and just happened to click on the WaSP link in her sig today. 
I've been spending a lot of time at W3.org to help with CSS assignments for school. 
My first attempt at validating a page I coded from scratch was really scary! 
I'm a baby as far as all of this standard/xml/css/php and all the other acronyms. 
I've learned what I know.. by doing. 
I've been a volunteer for the herplanet.com 
network for two years now and dove right in and taught myself a lot of the html/coding and scripting along with teaching my young ones a few curse words along the way (sorry kids). 
I won't be asking newbie questions or flooding the list with "how do you do this? or how do you do that?" 
I'm just here to absorb as much as I can. 
In school full time for Digital Media: Web Production emphasis and currently taking a beginning Web Design course which includes xml/css/javascript.. and the next class in the series teaches php. 
I started with front page.. we still use that program..and learned html just because I had to troubleshoot the fat code that netscape despises. 
I'm trying to pull away from depending on WYSIWYG programs.. but it's hard not to fall back on it. 
I'm just here to learn as much as I can. 
Out network is a bit behind the times and I'm hoping to influence them towards web standards and getting away from frames and includes.. a standby in our network. 
I am also a single WAHM to six kids ages 5 yo to 17 yo.

I guess I better had then, now I've been outed as a lurker! 
;) As Drew has already mentioned, I'm another WaSP DW Task Force member. 
I'm doing an increasing amount of writing on the subject of web standards - I am a co-author of 'Dynamic Dreamweaver MX' for Glasshaus - writing about best practices in development with CSS and XHTML/HTML within Dreamweaver MX, and have a few articles dotted around the web. 
Looking forward to some interesting discussion here =) Rachel Andrew work: http://www.edgeofmyseat.com play: http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk WaSP Dreamweaver Task Force http://www.webstandards.org 
Once upon a time, I could code a "cutting edge" page that rendered properly in every available browser. 
Mosaic, Netscape, Lynx, that flaky little Microsoft IE that no one used -- I could run the gamut. 
This was around the time of HTML 3.2, and I could make great sites because I really knew the code I was writing. 
Much of the browser wars were lost to me, busy as I was "growing the business". 
I'm in a small internet speciality shop in British Columbia Canada, where we provide all sorts of Internet-related services, training, and design, and are generally well-respected in the community. 
However, one day I woke up and realised that IE was largely dominant, Netscape was floundering, the old alternative browsers were all dead (replaced by a new guard), and the standards which I based my sites on were almost universally depreciated. 
Thankfully, I hadn't used much NS4 proprietary stuff (who knew?), but I found myself with a lot of obsolete code, and no clear upgrade path. 
It's one thing to make my sites match published standards (that I can do without difficulty), but another to actually _know_ the full potential of these new languages, styles, and specs. 
It seems to me that the vast majority of websites out there have yet to achieve the full potential of HTML 4.0, let alone what came next. 
I don't want to be like that. 
As a developer, I face the same challenges that dog standards compliance worldwide: finite resources, no time for extended training, a legacy of older code, and impatient clients who will only ever use the browser that comes with their OS. 
I'm subscribed to this list because I'm looking for clarity. 
I don't need to be sold on the idea of standards compliance; I'm already a believer. 
Like most webmasters, I want to build sites that are modern, interesting, intuitive, and compliant not just with standards, but with browsers in general. 
There are a lot of paths to this goal, and opinions are, um, liberally mixed. 
I fear that I could learn this the wrong way, and leave with some bad habits. 
How does one shift a "classical" knowledge of HTML to today's nifty specs, while maintaining compatibility, wow-factor, and standards? 
Carefully, I'd imagine. 
Thus, a discussion between like-minded people under the auspices of the W3C should help me separate the good from the bad. 
I won't be asking a million random questions -- just taking a lot of notes. 
This is my first day here, and I've already learned a surprising amount (keep those URLs coming!). 
In closing, my hope is that this list can help me with my grey-matter upgrade, and make Joseph McLean pass all relevant compliance checks.

There seems to be a fair number of designers and web developers on this forum, and that's a very good thing, since it should allow the evangelists ones to get some feedback and ideas on their work. 
Specifically, I think it would be interesting to know what designers and web developers would see as useful resources: - to help them with build standard compliant web sites 
- to help them with convincing their managers you should do that 
- to clarify classical errors/misunderstandings they have been through due to bad education outside for instance

A consistent implementation at the same level of the standards across the various browsers. 
Specifically, those browsers are Opera, Mozilla/Netscape/K-Meleon/Galeon/Gecko-based, and Internet Explorer. 
A clear list of advantages versus disadvantages of using the standards. 
Obviously, we want to lean toward the advantages side, but the list must be balanced to be effective. 
A list of only advantages will show that we don't care about the other side of the balance beam (metaphorically). 
I think we need to educate properly from the beginning. 
We need to make free up-to-date educational materials available to schools. 
As a high school student, I know that school will typically buy the cheaper text book. 
In the case of the World Wide Web's technologies, this is a bad idea. 
The text books I have seen teach how to use FrontPage (proprietary) and other WYSIWIG environments. 
Those that do teach HTML include the proprietary marquee and the deprecated style elements of HTML 3.2 and 4.0. 
Likewise we need to make it well know that HTML marks up semantically as opposed to syntactically. 
People think "How do I make this big, bold, and black?" 
instead of "How do I mark this as a heading (HTML) and once it is a heading, how do I tell that it should be big, bold, and black (CSS)?" 
Brant Langer Gurganus There is no failure until you fail to keep trying. 
As you all are surely aware, many people are still trying to practice "traditional medium" style design on the web. 
That is, many designers are trying to have precise control over what web users end experience will be like, and haven't really accepted that they can't have this control. 
They haven't understood that the web was not designed to solve that problem, and that it is not really trying to. 
Yet many designers still try to battle this fact every day in their work, or they just give up and label the site as "IE only, min 800x600". 
These are the concepts and design goals I try to convey to people when I introduce them to web design. 
I find it helpful to point people at something like browsers are out there. 
I try to explain how they can't be sure what fonts will be available, even on major platforms like the Mac versus PC. 
I try to explain about the millions of people who will use set top boxes and low resolution televisions to view their site, or devices like Palm Pilots. 
I think one idea for something that might help bring this home would be to create an example page designed for IE on the PC desktop. 
But then have a list of browsers on different platforms like that linked above, with a screenshot (or audio file!) of the site being displayed on each. 
Then you could label each browser with the number of people who use it, or at least, why people would need to use that browser. 
Next to a shot of the site being mostly illegible, "This is the most popular set top box in India/China, and in 2005 will be the primary means of internet access for two billion people" kinda thing. 
"This is a shot from the browser Ford is placing in the dashboard of 10 million cars over the next five years". 
You could also show the same example page rewritten to be more accessible, etc, and how it can still look good on the IE dektop, but have shots of the drastically better results on other platforms. 
I mean...the problem is the kinda thing we all talk about in theoretical terms...but I don't know of anywhere you can really /show/ people the results. 
Chris Hubick 
An excellent point, Chris. 
It was always much easier to say "if you code like this, it will work in both IE4 and NS4". 
Developers could try it out and see results. 
What's more everyone back then knew numerous other folk who had a different browser preference to themselves, so the benefits were obvious. 
When trying to evangelize web standards, the benefits are not always so apparent. 
How many people personally know someone who browses the web with a Braille reader? 
How many people even use their darn PDA for browsing the web? 
I know I only use my to check sites I've built. 
As far as the forward compatibility benefits go, not that many every-day developers have been around on the web as long as some of us, and maybe haven't been put in the position of dealing with legacy pain-in-the-butt systems - they simply can't imagine the immense value in forward compatibility. 
Who can blame them? 
The rest of web culture tells them to live for the moment. 
(you're only ever a quick FTP command away from correcting your mistakes, so why worry?). 
So how the heck to we make the benefits of standards-based markup/code real to the worker ants on the ground? 
drew mclellan WaSP dreamweaver task force team macromedia volunteer 
a thought: what about the possibility of creating some kind of ranked index of tutorials, reference and source materials on web standards created by developers and designers? 
something in the vein of daypop's top 40 list [1], perhaps. 
given the volume of material out there, it would be a site that points to the best sources, as determined by the developer community. 
from my own experience, i will often come across a site that best explains a given standard, programming trick, etc. and will then bookmark it and refer to it again and again. 
i would suspect that others do the same, and having these "people's choice" sources in a single location might be worth while... cheers, anthony anthony baker | aim: meadowlark07 t: 415.441.6819 | f: 415.276.9388
