<s> Hi, after updating from amaya 1.1a to 1.1b i encountered some problems.  </s>
<s> First amaya does not translate german umlauts (instaed of "aktivit&amp;auml;t" it outputs "aktivit?t".  </s>
<s> Also it has problems with the pre tags.  </s>
<s> Instead of newlines i get something like pre test~Jtest~Jtest /pre (correct output should be : pre test test test /pre  </s>
<s> Thanks Uli Ulrich Eckhardt mailto:uli@transcom.de Truly great madness can not be achieved without significant intelligence.  </s>

<s> It seems that you have a wrong installation.  </s>
<s> I tried the Linux version and met no problem with this character (I inserted a ?  </s>
<s> and saved the file; Amaya output &amp;auml;t)  </s>
<s> Same experiment and the result was correct: pre test test test /pre Could you reload your Linux version form the server Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Hi, i have reload the binary from your server and installed all from scratch.  </s>
<s> But i have the nearly the same problems, but now amaya displays this line correct (but not in the structure view) but not all other browsers like lynx or netscape.  </s>
<s> Afther a look on the generated code i found that the new-lines in pre tags have the hex-code 0x8a instaed of 0x0a ?  </s>
<s> all other newlines have the correct value 0x0a: Here is the output of a line with "od -ax" : 0000260 74 8a 54 65 73 74 8a 3c 2f 70 72 65 3e 0a 3c 2f t nl T e s t nl  / p r e  nl  / Also when i view the test lines bewteen the pre -tag in the structure view the view displays the tree words "test" in one line.  </s>
<s> I'll try to compile amaya and see if the problem is also there.  </s>
