Hi. First of all, please forgive my ignorance about this subject. 
I have downloaded, and printed, the DOM Level 1 Spec and think I have got the general idea. 
Also, I have downloaded the Java-bindings.zip file and have amended my CLASSPATH to point to the class files. 
My question is, how do I actually USE the Java Bindings classes? 
I don' t mean how do I use the interfaces, but how do I get access to the interfaces from within Java. 
Do I need to import the classes, or something? 
Ultimately, I want to be able to dynamically alter an HTML document using the HTML Bindings.

Hello, I have another Java language binding question: Why is the DOMException artificially made abstract?

Ideally the DOM java binding would only define interfaces. 
This is unfortunately impossible due to the way Java defines exceptions.
