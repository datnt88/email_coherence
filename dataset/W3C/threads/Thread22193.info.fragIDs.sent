All, In order to be able to release the full level 1 DOM TS, we need to look into the following issues: 
1. Framework. 
A contact has been made between Bob and Edward on the JsUnit framework. 
People from this list have volounteered to help in the effort, so please feel free to tell us what you need help with. 
2. HTML tests. 
We still need to sanitycheck the HTML tests, both the transcribed NIST ones and the submitted ones from Netscape. 
Has aynoen built/run those? 
3. Grant of license wording. 
Philippe, do you have the final woringd yet?

Though I have no problem with making JSUnit better, I'm not sure if it will be satisifactory since there is a lot of configuration that you would like to do in the test runner that can't be easily represented by selecting one of a collection of suites. 
I've compiled them for Java (to check for type mismatches), but haven't ran them on anything. 
Since the L1 suite contains a variant of all the L2 HTML tests, it is probably best to finish the sanity check on L2 HTML then visit the L1 HTML tests. 
Not ready yet but that shouldn't stop the release of the DOM Level 1 Test Suite since it is the grant of the license for Contributors, not the copyright of the test suite itself.
