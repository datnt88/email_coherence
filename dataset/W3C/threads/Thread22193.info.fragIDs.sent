<s> All, In order to be able to release the full level 1 DOM TS, we need to look into the following issues:  </s>
<s> 1. Framework.  </s>
<s> A contact has been made between Bob and Edward on the JsUnit framework.  </s>
<s> People from this list have volounteered to help in the effort, so please feel free to tell us what you need help with.  </s>
<s> 2. HTML tests.  </s>
<s> We still need to sanitycheck the HTML tests, both the transcribed NIST ones and the submitted ones from Netscape.  </s>
<s> Has aynoen built/run those?  </s>
<s> 3. Grant of license wording.  </s>
<s> Philippe, do you have the final woringd yet?  </s>
<s> /Dimitris  </s>
<s> Though I have no problem with making JSUnit better, I'm not sure if it will be satisifactory since there is a lot of configuration that you would like to do in the test runner that can't be easily represented by selecting one of a collection of suites.  </s>
<s> I've compiled them for Java (to check for type mismatches), but haven't ran them on anything.  </s>
<s> Since the L1 suite contains a variant of all the L2 HTML tests, it is probably best to finish the sanity check on L2 HTML then visit the L1 HTML tests.  </s>
<s> Not ready yet but that shouldn't stop the release of the DOM Level 1 Test Suite since it is the grant of the license for Contributors, not the copyright of the test suite itself.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
