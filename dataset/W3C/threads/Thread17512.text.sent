I have sent some editorial comments directly to Jon but I would like some input on the following issue. 
The current version of the guidelines include the following: 5.3 Direct Navigation 1.[PRIORITY 1] Allow the user to use the keyboard to move the focus directly to links and controls on a page. 
Users should be able to search for (and shift the focus to) a link or control by its position or by its name Kitch: I am not sure what you mean by "should be able to search for a link or control by its position?" 
Does this mean position in a list of elements? 
Also, while the ability to search for and move the focus to an element or control is important and should be included, I don't know if it is the best, or only, way to provide direct access to elements. 
This issue may not be as critical if manufacturers provide "alternative views" of pages. 
Please correct me if I am wrong but, could this be one possible scenario of how someone who uses a screen reader would use the search feature - He or she might - 1) listen to a web page 2) may or may not be able easily identify the text in a link, depending upon how the link is rendered and how the screen reader is configured 3) issue a "find" command for a word in the desired link 4) repeat the "find" command since the chosen word may or may not be unique to that link. 
this may mean that the user also has to issue "read line" commands to identify all of the text in a link prior to making his or her selection 5) and finally, activate the desired link. 
If each link and control could be uniquely identified, on user command, by a number or some other means, it seems that this process of directly accessing a link would be easier. 
In other words, can some of the features of lynx be built into other browsers? 
Kitch position was taken by me to meen some sort of key order such as number or letter. 
hit the letter or number or other symbol corresponding uniquely to that link to address that link.

The ability to search for a link is a very different task than selecting the link. 
There should be two different recommendations, prioritized differently.
