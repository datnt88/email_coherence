<s> (many implementations include a single quote at position 39 instead of an apostrophe, but this is in error)  </s>

<s> I'm not actually sure why any beyong and &amp;amp; are needed, although  is good for symmetry.  </s>
<s> The current situation is so much of an improvement that it seems almost churlish to ask this, but why is &amp;apos; included when it is not recognised in plain text?  </s>

<s> is defined as [single] quotation mark in ISO8879:1986(e) D.4.3.1, ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic, along with lsquo and rsquo for open and close single quote and apos for apostrophe.  </s>

<s> The standard doesn't say which it is, only that it is a quotation mark, but the 10646 draft I have uses QUOTATION MARK for a double quote.  </s>
<s> I don't know which interpretation is correct, butif RFC1866 has quot being a double quote, we'd better stick with it.  </s>

<s> ISO 10646 and other ISO character sets uniformly use 'quotation mark' -- which is what the comment in the entity set says -- for the " symbol, and 'apostrophe' for the ' symbol, and 'grave accent' (and possibly something else indicating its use as an open single quote) for the ` character.  </s>
<s> That seems to me reason enough to believe the  should be treated as ", and &amp;apos; as '.  </s>
<s> providing quot and apos makes it possible for attribute values to contain both characters; it also allows the user to choose which delimter to use, if they prefer to use the same one all the time.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, one would have sufficed.  </s>
<s> It is recognized in literals and may need to be escaped there.  </s>
