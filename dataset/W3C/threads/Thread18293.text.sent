Hello, Checkpoint 3.8 in the 18 August Guidelines [1] includes the sentence "Advise the user to refresh content according to the same schedule as the automatic refresh, and indicate when the user has not yet refreshed content." 
The term "prompt" appears in checkpoints 9.2 and 1.5. 
The terms "alert" and "notification" are used in checkpoint 1.5. 
I propose the following: 1) That we only use the term "notify" in the checkpoints and that we define it to mean "inform the user through the user interface". 
Note that I do not talk about APIs here. 
That is a separate requirement (that messages through the UI also be available through an API). 
2) That "notify" be independent of a particular mechanism in the user interface (but that any notification be accessible). 
3) That the term "prompt" be reserved for a particular UI approach, but that we don't attempt to define it! 
I would note that the AU Guidelines [2] includes a definition of prompt, but since then, that WG has had a number of discussions on the definition (refer to [3], [4], [5], and [6] at least). 
4) In checkpoint 3.8, rewrite the sentence cited above to be "Notify the user ..." 5) We could rewrite checkpoint 9.2 to not use the word prompt: Allow configuration so the user can confirm any form submission not caused by explicit activation of a form submit control. 
Otherwise, if we intend to use prompt to mean "the user must intervene before anything else happens", we should define it to mean that. 
I want to avoid having to define it. 
6) What techniques, if any, do we need for notification or configuration of notification in general? 
a) Configuration to have no notification. 
b) Configuration to prompt the user and require input before continuing. 
c) Configuration to notify the user but without requiring any input from the user.

Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 AG:: It is not clear that such a change would be an improvement. 
'Prompt' is used to good effect in 9.2. 
Substituting 'notify' here would, in all probability, decrease the likelihood that readers understand this point. 
The language in 9.2 is clear and says the right thing as of the 18 August Draft. 
If we wish to reduce the variety of terms used in this area, then in 3.8 replace the phrase "indicate when the user has not yet refreshed content." with "notify when new content is available, based on the automatic update schedule." 
But, in guideline 1.5 it helps to use a variety of terms because the reader may only recognize one of these as describing their case, but the rule applies to a broader category than is indicated by any single term in common use. 
Al With respect the discussion on requiring DOM 2, I see that there is no reference to using the DOM 2 event model in the requirements. 
While there are issues with PF needing device independence addressed, the mutuation events as well as the referred to device independent events, such as DOMFocusIn, in the event model are very useful to assisstive technologies. 
In the 18 August draft checkpoint 5.5 dicsusses programmatic notification of changes to the document and focus. 
The techniques refers to DOM level 2 events. 
Should 5.5 require the DOM level two event model API for these types of events? 
Or, should we have a special case P3 requirement, like that provided for CSS that would require the use of the DOM 2 event model for these events. 
I don't want to slow down the document but since 5.5 refers to DOM 2 in the techniques this requirement isn't really new.

Frost RIch, DOM 2 is not a recommendation yet, so it is not currently included in the document. 
Ian has proposed a way of dealing with DOM 2 specifications and there is an issue on the issue list that the group will discuss before we go to last call.

Following are a few comments on Ian Jacob's (IJ) memo [2]. 
Other related comments are in [1]. 
My comments are marked with "EH:". 
[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0314.html [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0309.html 
IJ: EH: This seems to be a new concept, this idea of "prompt" being reserved for a particular UI approach, but that we don't attempt to define it. 
I find this problematic because not having agreed-upon definitions usually leads to problems. 
For example, this approach begs the question as to what constitutes a "UI approach". 
For example, do a picture and visually-displayed text count a single UI approach (because they are both "visual") or as two approaches (because they are useful for different disability groups)? 
I really don't see why "prompt" should be treated differently than any other unrendered (or pre-rendering) content: If it is a non-text content (and it isn't secondary content) then it needs a text equivalent and all checkpoints pertaining to text equivalents apply. 
Beyond that, _if_ there are special classes of content (alerts, notifications, prompts, indications (?), repair text, etc.), that need to be treated differently, then we need to have checkpoints that provide that guidance. 
See [1] for further discussion.
