<s> I've finally gotten back to the DOM Level 3 Load/Save draft, and have started playing with a Python implementation again.  </s>
<s> I have a few comments/questions.  </s>
<s> These are based on the 14 Jan 2002 draft.  </s>
<s> 1. Issue LS-Issue-2.  </s>
<s> The resolution for this issue indicates that vendors should define  </s>
<s> their extensions to the set of features using a vendor-specific prefix string, but does not reserve any specific prefix for the W3C.  </s>
<s> This seems fairly important; I'm sure there are people who expect the W3C will want to add additional features in the future.  </s>
<s> It wouldn't even hurt for there to be a way to "register" prefixes in some way, even if it only amounts to reversing a domain name as is done for Java packages.  </s>
<s> 2. What happened to the "namespaces" feature?  </s>
<s> This feature seems to have disappeared since the last version I read (two drafts back, dated 7 June 2001).  </s>
<s> I don't see this mentioned in the issue notes that have been added since then.  </s>
<s> I'd like to understand the rationale for removing this.  </s>
<s> I don't see anything else in the spec that would allow me to avoid namespace processing, and it simply isn't needed for everything.  </s>
<s> I don't think the APIs should make it difficult for me to provide a single DOMImplementation instance and support producing Document instances parsed with and without namespaces enabled.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I'm missing something?  </s>
<s> I still read namespaces as being optional.  </s>
<s> 3. Overloading of the term "feature".  </s>
<s> Is there a reason there are DOM features which are used to determine what components are implemented, and "features" that can be enabled/disabled to control specific behaviors of a component?  </s>
<s> I'd really love to see these things carry different names.  </s>
<s> The later could be called "properties" to avoid confusion and term overloading.  </s>
<s> 4. Feature names for DOMImplementation.hasFeature().  </s>
<s> While the Abstract Schema seems to define feature names that can be tested with the hasFeature() method, these are noticably absent from the Load/Save specification.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see loading and saving each get a distinct feature string.  </s>
<s> [I see this has been brought up before and Phillipe Le Hegaret said it was "fixed", but that's not a public document yet: Though I trust Phillipe to be telling the truth, I'm leaving this in for completeness, and because I don't trust non-public drafts not to change.]  </s>
<s> 5. DOMBuilder.entityResolver.  </s>
<s> The description should describe what support a builder is expected to provide if the resolver is not specified.  </s>
<s> When a new builder is created, should a default resolver be exposed via this attribute, to allow client code to "wrap" a basic resolver, or should the default value be null?  </s>
<s> (This kind of information would be helpful for many attributes in the DOM spec.) 6. DOMBuilder.errorHandler.  </s>
<s> When a new builder is created, should a error handler be exposed via this attribute, to allow client code to "wrap" a handler, or should the default value be null?  </s>
<s> 7. Terminating parsing from a DOMBuilderFilter.  </s>
<s> The description of the DOMBuilderFilter states that parsing can be terminated early using a filter, but doesn't give a specific recommendation or mechanism regarding how to do this.  </s>
<s> Should this be binding-specific, or is there a particular DOM exception which should be raised?  </s>
<s> 8. DOMBuilderFilter.whatToShow.  </s>
<s> The description of this attribute states that attribute nodes will never be passed to the filter, and the description of the filter interface also states that the document element will not be passed to the filter.  </s>
<s> What about the Document, DocumentType, Notation, and Entity nodes?  </s>
<s> 9. DocumentLS.saveXML().  </s>
<s> Why would the return value ever be null?  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Typos.  </s>
<s> No, I didn't spell-check the thing, but I did notice a few.  </s>

<s> I would have preferred personally to see URIs (http://www.w3.org/2002/validate-if-schema) rather ad-hoc prefixes (w3.org.validate-if-schema) but, for usability reasons (avoiding typos), the WG decided to stick with validate-if-schema.  </s>
<s> The simple fact that  </s>
<s> SAX is using URI and not the W3C DOM seems really inconsistent IMHO.  </s>
<s> For events, we did pick a prefix (DOM) but now, with XML Events, we're back to the format {http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events},{mouseclick}, which produce some weird naming for {http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events},{DOMActivate}.  </s>
<s> Anyway, having said that, I don't see the WG changing its mind on that.  </s>
<s> I tried to look back in our archives to find the exact reason but didn't  </s>
<s> find it.  </s>
<s> As far as I remember, we decided that namespaces will not be  </s>
<s> optional for the DOM Level 3 Load and Save and won't provide a way to not have namespaces in LS. Nowadays, all XML applications provided within the W3C (and a lot outside the W3C) do have namespaces support.  </s>
<s> So we classified XML applications without namespaces in our design failure category.  </s>
<s> I understand that this might be viewed as an arbitrary choice but it is also clear in our mind that the DOM 3 LS is only *a* solution to load a DOM tree and not *the* solution, especially when we don't resolve at all the problems related with the XML processing model.  </s>
<s> "properties" would collide with the ECMAScript properties.  </s>
<s> We used to have "options" but it wasn't really great with our optional "options".  </s>
<s> Thanks for the reminder.  </s>
<s> I checked our latest internal version and we did address the issue (and rearranged a little the table of contents at the time).  </s>
<s> We'll probably published a draft in March after addressing the rest of your issues next week.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> I'd be happy with URIs as well.  </s>
<s> The real point is to avoid name clashes between vendor extensions and W3C-ordained options.  </s>
<s> This seems *incredibly* arbitrary.  </s>
<s> I can tell you now what my first extension will be.  </s>
<s> I'm just not sure what to call it.  </s>
<s> Even if the spec makes a turn-off-namespaces option default to false (namespaces enabled) and make support for namespace-less processing optional, I think a lot of implementations will have a namespace-less mode, and it would be very helpful if there was exactly one name for that.  </s>
<s> I look forward to the next draft.  </s>
<s> I hope to have time next week to write up some additional comments that I think should be addressed before the spec is considered "implementable".  </s>
<s> Thanks for taking time to address my concerns.  </s>

<s> Since I'm into checking the resolutions of our f2f, let me report that you've got your "namespaces" feature back in the LS specification (issue LS-101 in the to-publish-asap-version).  </s>
<s> Namespace processing is required for DOM LS implementation and is the default behavior.  </s>
<s> Being able to desactivate namespace processing (ie being able to set the feature to false) is not required for implementation.  </s>
