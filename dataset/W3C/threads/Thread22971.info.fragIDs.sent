<s> Dave, I find the spec to be very clear.  </s>
<s> Whatever document that the node was created from, no matter how it was created, will have it's ownerDocument property set to that document.  </s>
<s> The reason why Document nodes do not apply is that it is created by the parser engine, not a document.  </s>
<s> A document is not owned by a document.  </s>
<s> The reason why a DocumentType node does not have an owner document (I am assuming here) is because it is also a stand-alone document.  </s>
<s> This document is used to describe the tag structure rules for a HTML or XML document.  </s>
<s> Thus a DocumentType node is not owned by a document.  </s>

<s> There isn't a really good reason that a Document isn't its own ownerDocument; that's just the way it happened to get defined.  </s>
<s> DocumentType is normally created before the document, without knowing which document it might be going into, and hence starts out with ownerDocument being null.  </s>
<s> When you get around to using it as a parameter in the createDocument method, its ownerDocument will be set and locked in.  </s>
<s> All other nodes have their ownerDocument set before Document.create...() returns.  </s>

<s> That's what I assumed, but I don't think the spec ever actually says this, and I'd suggest that it ought to be clarified.  </s>
<s> All I can find about it is:  </s>
<s> The Document object associated with this node.  </s>
<s> This is also the Document object used to create new nodes.  </s>
<s> When this node is a Document or a DocumentType which is not used with any Document yet, this is null.  </s>
<s> Perhaps that second sentence is trying to say this: When one of the create methods of a Document object is used to create a new node, the ownerDocument property of the newly created node is set to the creating Document object.  </s>
<s> However, I read it as saying: If you've got a node A, and want to create a new node B as part of the same document, then use the ownerDocument property of node A to find the Document object to use.  </s>
<s> I suggest a clarification (although I do not suggest using my language above!) David Flanagan  </s>
<s> Yes, much better.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> When this node is a Document or a DocumentType which is not used with any Document yet, this is null.  </s>
<s> I agree that the "this" is badly overloaded here, and that the antecedents are not obvious.  </s>
<s> Possible rewording: The Document object associated with this node.  </s>
<s> For most nodes, this refers to the Document whose factory methods created them (and which can be used to create other nodes compatable with them).  </s>
<s> When a node is either a Document, or a DocumentType which is has not yet been associated with a specific document by the DOMImplementation.createDocument method, its ownerDocument is null.  </s>
<s> Better?  </s>
