Hello all, At today's teleconference [1], we talked about support for THEAD in HTML user agents. 
The context: Do user agents support the rendering where THEAD rows are fixed on the screen while other data cells are scrolled by. 
To test this, I have published a test table [2] that uses THEAD for the first row (the one starting "Rows"). 
My results in my Linux environment are that no user agent I have supports this, including: Lynx 2.8.4rel.1 [Text browser] w3m 0.3 [Text browser that supports tables somewhat] Mozilla 0.9.9 Netscape 7.0 Preview release 1 Amaya 5.3 (18 Dec 2001) Opera 6.0 Preview 6 Konqueror 2.2.2 (KDE 2.2.2) Dillo 0.6.4 Untested: Galeon (Not working on my machine since I installed Netscape 7) Skipstone (I just installed to test this one, but it crashes). 
Perhaps I missed some UA configurations that would cause these user agents to keep THEAD frozen in place, but I didn't find any settings. 
I also tried using 'position:fixed' on the THEAD element for user agents that support CSS fixed positioning. 
However, since fixed positioning pulls an element out of the flow, the result (at least on Opera) is that the THEAD row is not formatted the same as the other (TBODY) rows. 
So while the THEAD row remains fixed on the screen, the cells in the other rows don't line up with it, so this approach is not helpful.

My results for TBODY and THEAD with Macintosh OS 9.2.1 were the same as the results Ian reported for LINUX, not support for fixed THEAD and scrollable TBODY: Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.1: Does not support a fixed THEAD Netscape Navigator 6.2: Does not support a fixed THEAD Opera 5: Does not support a fixed THEAD Jon do you have one for tfoot as well? 
and scope? 
I've updated the test file for tables [1] to include tests for: 1. THEAD 2. TFOOT 3. headers attribute (and abbr attribute) 4. scope attribute (and abbr attribute) I have not included text describing the expected results (as a real test suite would have).

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Ian, Colin Koteles and I can take what you have and put it into the new testsuite XML format we are developing. 
I hope to publish a draft of HTML test for checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2 later today. 
Jon do you have one for tfoot as well? 
and scope?

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Sorry to interrupt, but ... I think your expectation is wrong. 
"11.2.3 Row groups: the THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY elements" of HTML 4 says as follows [3]: Table rows may be grouped into a table head, table foot, and one or more table body sections, using the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements, respectively. 
This division enables user agents to support scrolling of table bodies independently of the table head and foot. 
Note that this division *enables* user agents to support scrolling. 
It doesn't mean TBODY must always be scrollable when THEAD is present. 
HTML markup specifies table head - body - foot structure, and that's it. 
If you want specific presentation, use style sheets. 
Your test file doesn't attach any style sheets, so it seems quite natural to me that user agents don't make tables scrollable. 
What you want is to make TBODY scrollable, isn't it? 
Then don't try to do something for THEAD. 
Something like TBODY { height: 10em; overflow: auto; } would enable user agents to make TBODY scrollable when the height of the table body is more than 10em, for example. 
It should at least work with Gecko-based user agents.

W3C - World Wide Web Consortium No success with THEAD or TFOOT on Windows 2000: Mozilla 1.0: Does not support a fixed THEAD Opera 6.03: Does not support a fixed THEAD m Massyasu, We know that scrollable TBODY it is not required by the HTML 4.01 specification, we are just testing to see if anyone has implemented this feature, since it is useful to people with disabilities. 
We are doing this test to help in the clarification of the requirements for Checkpoint 10.1. 
It will probably not be a requirement of UAAG 1.0 since there is no implementation experience, but be included in a note stating that it is a useful feature to implement.

Since we have no implementation experience, I suggest that the scrollable TBODY and fixed THEAD/TFOOT be included as a note in UAAG. 
Any objections? 
Jon When we discussed this at the teleconference yesterday, I pointed out that this behavior was not required by user agents. 
It would be possible, even without style sheets, for a user agent to offer a configuration to exhibit such behavior. 
I have not found this option in any browser I've tested. 
Nor did I find scrolling as the default behavior (which was my expectation). 
Will do. 
Thank you for the input Masayasu! 
The results for Masayasu's technique (now part of the test file): Mozilla (Gecko engine): Yes (both THEAD, TFOOT since set on TBODY). 
This implies (though not tested) that Galeon and Netscape 7 should work as well. 
Konqueror 2.2.2: No. Amaya: No. Opera 6.0: No. _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org) 
http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Mimasa's technique works in Gecko-based browsers. 
I suggest trying again on IE for Windows/Mac (same test file). 
In any case, should we keep 10.1 or not, I think we need to make it more specific to this particular behavior for graphical user agents.

Well, if what Mimasa suggested works in browsers then we do have implementation experience... Chaals Since we have no implementation experience, I suggest that the scrollable TBODY and fixed THEAD/TFOOT be included as a note in UAAG. 
Any objections?
