<s> Dear IANA, This is a bug report on the structure of your web site.  </s>
<s> I just had a look at http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets.  </s>
<s> Therein I found  </s>
<s> Name: windows-1251 MIBenum: 2251 Source: Microsoft (see ../character-set-info/windows-1251) [Lazhintseva] Alias: None This suggests (according to the rules for relative URIs) that this information is available at  </s>
<s> However, this URI returns a '404 not found'.  </s>
<s> The same for: (which is what you might have wanted to point to, or may want to point to in the future, in which case you should say (see character-set-info/windows-1251) rather than (see ../character-set-info/windows-1251).  </s>
<s> I finally found what I guess is the right thing at: But this was only possible by trial-and-error.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if I try to look at I get the following: The Character Sets Registry has moved to the following: For all registries, please see the following: Updated May 01 2001 I strongly suggest that you move all your data to the same site (www.iana.org), and that you use an automatic redirect rather than a manual redirect to refer people from Also, I have found a lot of files in that end with a tilde.  </s>
<s> I suspect that these are artefacts from editing, and I suggest that you remove them.  </s>
<s> Please feel free to ask in case you have any questions.  </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance for your kind consideration.  </s>

<s> why do you assume that ../character-set-info/windows-1251 is a URI or that the rules for relative URIs apply here?  </s>
<s> the real lesson, I think, is to not embed filenames into documents.  </s>

<s> Hello Keith,  </s>
<s> If you give me a better suggestion for how to interpret ../character-set-info/windows-1251, I'll go with it.  </s>
<s> And I wouldn't have to use URI rules, even on a single machine, with several OSes, it would be pretty much the same.  </s>
<s> And I actually got to the point I wanted after going up and down in the hierarchy a bit more.  </s>
<s> Let's please not use philosophical arguments to detract from the straightforward job of cleaning up the redirects.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Keith and Martin, Just to add....  </s>
<s> I'm in the process of moving all of the registrations to WWW.IANA.ORG.  </s>
<s> This is 1 of 3 areas that are the last to be moved from isi.edu to iana.org.  </s>
<s> For example: will be moved to something like this: As soon as I complete this I will send a note to the ietf-charsets list.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you see anything else that needs to be changed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Michelle IANA  </s>

<s> Keith  </s>
<s> Martin and Harald, I have made some changes to the Character Set information that is linked from the IANA page at These changes include the following: I have added: http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-reg/index.htm  </s>
<s> This now replaces the isi.edu page.  </s>
<s> At: http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets  </s>
<s> I have updated the registrations that include pointers to registration templates to now point to www.iana.org  </s>
<s> Please let me know if you see anything that appears incorrect.  </s>
