Hi, I was really interested to get diff.py to work. 
Perhaps I am doing something wrong. 
But since I ran the unit tests and they failed (see previous mail) I think it could well be some problem with the code. 
I am running OSX Attached are the two rdf files that I ran the command with. 
I generated these files from two n3 files using cwm 18:59:59 - ~/Work/Programming/w3c/2000/10/swap hjs@bblfish:0$ uname -a Darwin bblfish.local

Sorry that was the wrong output I sent. 
Below is what I am getting. 
It looks like it is trying to get the file http://purl.org/atom/ns and croaking on trying to parse that. 
I'll see if I can point the name space to the right file.

That was indeed correct. 
I needed the name space to point to the owl file I used as a model. 
It still does not work, but that is because my graph is insufficiently labeled. 
I will need to read TBL's paper more carefully and see if I can improve the constraints on the OWL semantics, or if I just need to find a way create resource names for the graph elements. 
Henry PS. Sorry to have pressed the bug filing button too soon. 
That must have been because I did not get the tests to work previously... 
After labeling every point of the graph, I still get a problem. 
Attached are the three files needed to duplicate this experiment. 
There is very little difference between blog-1.n3 and blog-2.n3. 
A normal unix diff reveals only one line non commented difference. 
I tested diff on the from.n3 and to.n3 
ical examples and those worked well. 
I am at a bit of a loss. 
I would have to look at the python code, but, not being a python person, this might take me a lot longer than the time I may have.

Henry, I'll fork this as a separate bug, as it is a problem with the way cwm uses the python library that error 404 doesn't turn up as an exception, but a parse error when attemting to parse the Error 404 message as RDF! Tim 
Henry, Ooops . 
Thanks - it crashed with a graph with no bnodes at all. 
I checked in a version of diff with this fixed.
