<s> Hi, just some points to maybe think over ... ;-) + in the menue help there is no entry "using amaya" (the page you get when going up from the help-pages) + I'd be pleased if there were an entry in menue Help which could be called "Amaya's Home" with a link to the homepage with further information + the logos on the left top of the help-pages could be linked to the w3c and the amaya-homepage  </s>
