<s> The November 14th draft is available in HTML, zipped PostScript, gzipped PostScript, zipped RTF, and gzipped RTF, at  </s>
<s> The HTML looks a little different - critiques on that welcome; since this will be the first form that many people will run across, it's worthwhile investing time in making it friendly.  </s>
<s> One specific question: all of the terms in the XML source are linked to a termdef ... /termdef phrase.  </s>
<s> HTML being what it is, I've just put a hot-link in to the beginning of the termdef.  </s>
<s> Can anyone think of a clever trick to mark the extent of these definitions without seriously impairing the readability of the HTML?  </s>
<s> Coming real soon now: SGML/XML version, as soon as we finish wrangling the Panorama stylesheet.  </s>
<s> If anyone else reading this can think of another delivery format I'd be happy to host it.  </s>
<s> I find the slight differences in flavor that you get in the different versions are very interesting.  </s>
<s> The RTF/PostScript certainly has immensely superior typographic values; on the other hand, the fact that all the terms and nonterminals and references in the HTML are hotlinks is a substantial value-add.  </s>
<s> If you're having trouble printing one of the RTF/PS versions, you can get something perfectly usable by bringing the HTML up in a browser, reducing the font size to the minimum, and printing there; I find that MSIE produces a slightly more elegant printout than Netscape, but your mileage may vary.  </s>
<s> For what it's worth, Michael and I are agreed, but the ERB hasn't yet considered the question, that the huge list of 10646 character roles should migrate into an appendix, with a pointer in the main text.  </s>
<s> Aside from being hideously ugly, it breaks up the flow [and also, things that are in the appendix don't count against XML's 20-page budget.]  </s>
<s> Does anyone have a reason not to do this? - Tim  </s>
<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> I think that in general, the names of the major character classes is enough.  </s>
<s> Well done.  </s>
<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> The Technical Corrigendum (TC) to SGML on Extended Naming Rules (ENR) looks like it has succeeded.  </s>
<s> If so, there is now a legit SGML declaration possible for defining all those extra name characters, if they are used.  </s>
<s> (EditTime editor already handles ENR/Unicode, if anyone is interested.) ENR TC is at http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg8/document/1896.htm  </s>
<s> By the way, if the XML data has been generated valid, am I right in thinking a non-validing XML parser is completely OK with the robust and simple lexical rule that a name is anything up to a delimiter or 's' (after entity references in (non-CDATA) attribute values have been resolved)?  </s>
<s> If so, that should be made clear in the 1.0 spec, since it drastically simplifies things for implementors.  </s>
<s> Also, I think the &amp;u form entities should just have the "u" prefix, not the "u-" prefix.  </s>
<s> I don't think it adds anything, and, potentially add thousands of characters to any entity declarations.  </s>
