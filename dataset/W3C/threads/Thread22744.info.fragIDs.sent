<s> Setting aside the fact that I can't seem to keep myself from responding to list messages prior to RTFM (honestly, I knew that the Document can, along with a single Element, have Comments, PIs, and a DocumentType -- I just glazed over that stuff), the Level 2 DOM still doesn't provide for a Document Declaration node.  </s>
<s> So if an implementation wanted the Document to provide access to the XMLDecl version attribute, it would have to implement an extension.  </s>

<s> never the less, here goes :) when you open an xml file with var.open(...) it creates a #document node with at least two child nodes, the first one is the xml node that has is own actributes (one of wich is the version acttribute, sinse it has to be set) and the other is the root node (what ever it might be called).  </s>
<s> Has you can see the way to get the version is to get that attribute in the xml node has you would do with any other attribute.  </s>
