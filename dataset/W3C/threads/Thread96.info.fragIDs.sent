<s> Tidy looks to be a terrific tool for our project.  </s>
<s> However, it has one feature which prevents us from using it---it wraps a line at a point that is inappropriate given our HTML files; we would like to see whether there is a way to modify this behavior.  </s>
<s> To get around the mathematics limitations of HTML, we frequently format logical formulas by stringing together a series of specially created graphics and emphasized text, for example:  </s>
<s> img src="foo.gif"  </s>
<s> this-string-should-stay-adjacent-to-gif--nospace-allowed Though we want tidy to wrap lines at 72 characters, and our project requires  </s>
<s> "wrap-attributes: no", tidy introduces a linebreak into the above at the first em tag, thereby producing:  </s>
<s> this-string-should-stay-adjacent-to-gif--nospace-allowed This introduces a space between the graphic and the text, and that space ruins the logical formula which we are attempting to display.  </s>
<s> Do we need to change the way the markup tree is built or the way the tree is pretty printed?  </s>
<s> Could you at least point us to the spot (or spots) in the source where this behavior is generated.  </s>

<s> [which is "tidied" as:]  </s>
<s> That sounds to me like a browser bug; but let's not quibble and instead accept that you don't want the line break.  </s>
<s> Do you use pre anywhere?  </s>
<s> If not, perhaps you don't need line breaks.  </s>
<s> And if this is so, you could just do a spot of postprocessing to remove them wholesale, converting from  </s>

<s> Too lazy to learn perl (etc.),  </s>
<s> I use Thomas Lundin's MS-DOS/Windows-based search-and-replace utility "SNR" for this kind of thing.  </s>
<s> As shareware goes, it's not cheap, but it's handy for all sorts of purposes.  </s>
<s> (Most of its rivals are limited to working line by line, and won't insert or delete line breaks.) Strangely, SNR doesn't seem to have its own web page, but if you poll Google for "thomas lundin snr" you'll find various sources for it.  </s>

<s> The browser does right, interpreting the end-of-line as white-space and displaying it as a space.  </s>
<s> I have a similar "problem" with Tidy when changing font size/weight between words.  </s>
<s> Where Tidy puts the span ... tag (or whatever) relative to its adjacent space does matter, as the size of that space changes with which font it is associated with.  </s>
<s> Tidy, quite understandably, does not "remember" which side of the space the tag was on.  </s>

<s> It seems like, to me, that Tidy should NEVER insert any white space where it matters; only where the white space doesn't matter.  </s>
