When I install the Microsoft Office HTML Filter mentioned below, there is no indication where the command line tool is located. 
Can someone give me a folder name?

I found filter.exe in my c:\winnt directory. 
I don't remember if I moved it from c:\winnt\system or c:\winnt\system32 Just do a file search for filter.exe on your c drive. 
You should find it, if it installed correctly.
