How about 3 degrees 1 img src = for images that are freely copyable 2 inl src = for images to which the creator would prefer inline references to be used, (not to be printed). 
3 cop src = for images that are only to be cached How would one get this implemented?

The trouble with that approach is existing browsers won't display the 
image for anything other than IMG. 
Perhaps it would be better to put 
the extra information either as extra attributes (eg. 
IMG SRC="blah" COPY="Never!" ) or as comments. 
Although personally I don't see what's wrong with existing methods (ie. 
say on the page or in its comments 
whether you mind people copying, and assume "don't copy" if nothing is said and/or email the webmaster), unless you want some automatic copier. 
(It would take ages for webmasters to start using any new method on a widespread basis, by which time HTML will probably be old stuff) Regards -- Silas S Brown, St John's College Cambridge UK http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/

The image publishing industry and the web consumer industry are going to 
fight this one out and we get to live with the answer. 
Copyright law is inconsistent, insufficient, and about to change in this area. 
Using a URI in your document which identifies an image which someone else 
has published to the web without access restrictions falls under the "just use" realm just like putting a citation for someone else's journal article in your bibliography. 
They serve the image, you haven't copied and served it. 
This is a consumer opinion, not a legal opinion. 
The W3C proposal for how people will learn things like copy permissions on images is via the Resource Description Framework, or RDF. 
Are you concerned about being sued for your use of other's images, or concerned to protect images that you develop?

I am not particularly concerned for my own copyright, though I prefer inlining as it maintains connections. 
I would like to be able to inline link to say disney pages using a disney image. 
As it is intended that the browser should be able to have access to the 'whole web' it is not practical to ask individual sites for permissions.

Is this so that your browser can automatically grab the logo from the site and display in in your browser? 
So a person could say do a search and get a bunch of logos automatically extracted and then click on a logo to get to its site? 
If thats the purpose of the site it may affect the legal question. 
After all, search engines routinely quote the first few lines of pages they find 
without violating copyright. 
So if a search engine quoted an image, it may 
be legal. 
BUT I'm not a lawyer. 
I just give the above observation to mention to a real legal expert. 
My basic point is that the answer can depend on what you do with the image. 
And as an unrelated point: Of course, sometimes the image will be an image of text so ideally you'd want something that distinguishes that.

I'm not sure in your particular case, but in general, the main reason people shouldn't do is not copyright but the fact that - you don't know (unless it's explicitly stated) if /path/img.gif is a stable URI or just an implementation detail on the site (and the fact that references img.gif on remote.com is stable has nothing to do with that) - even the URI doesn't change, the content of the image might change (size, pixels: there goes your ALT) - the www.company.com 
server might be down or much slower than yours, and if everybody generalizes this technique, users of the web will be faced with the lowest quality denominator syndrom: the bandwidth of one given page will be the bandwitdh of the slowest resource on that page: a scarry thought.
