Hello, I am urgently using tidy for my master graduation project. 
When I use tidy with the url "http://www.denverartmuseum.org/cfm/exhibit.cfm", it gives me the following exception message on the screen: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 8192 at org.w3c.tidy.PPrint.printText(PPrint.java, 
Compiled Code) at org.w3c.tidy.PPrint.printDocType(PPrint.java, Compiled Code) at org.w3c.tidy.PPrint.printTree(PPrint.java,

Compiled Code) at Test16.run(Test16.java, 
Compiled Code) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java, 
Compiled Code) Would you please do me a favor to tell me what's the probelm here? 
How I can fix it? 
(When I run tidy, I tested that this url works ok.) Looking forward to your kind reply. 
Great thanks. 
Major Shao Computer Science Department UT Arlington cxs0187@omega.uta.edu Major -- I do not get this problem with the latest (r6) version of JTidy. 
This probably relates to a bug in an earlier version of JTidy which has since been fixed. 
Please download the latest version and give it a try and let us know if you still have the problem. 
Gary Dear Sir, Great thanks to your kind help. 
I am heavily lost in tidy package now. 
Where can i get the whole class relation diagram? 
I cannot see the relation among so many java files. 
When I see the two java example files to use tidy, it is not easy to see how they use tidy. 
Especially, Node and NodeList are interfaces, i haven't find the implementation of the methods in them. 
PLease do kind help on me. 
I just download "tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" from I am using java on Linux machine. 
But, when I run "rpm -Uvh tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" or "rpm -ivh tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" or "rpm -i tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm", 
I got same error message: failed to open /var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm: 
Permission denied error: cannot open /var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm 
How to deal with this? 
Looking forward to your kind help. 
Major Hi, John You are very right. 
My supervisor installed it. 
But, how can i know the source downloaded from "http://perso.club-internet.fr/dpo/rpm/" is written in Java or C? How can i open the source rpm to see the source code? 
I do hope it is written in Java. 
Great thanks for kind help. 
I do appreciate it. 
Major Don't know if this is applicable, but are you logged on as root? 
/var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm is owned by root on my machine. 
So if you haven't already done so, try working as root. 
Don't know if this might help, but good luck. 
John I don't really have one. 
You'd have to create this using a reverse-engineering tool like Rose or Together. 
Or do it manually :( These methods are implemented in the DOM... classes in JTidy. 
Sorry, I don't know anything about .rpm 
files or Linux. 
Sami? 
Gary
