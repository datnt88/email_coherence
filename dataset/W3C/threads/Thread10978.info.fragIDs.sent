<s> I am surprised that nobody has remarked on the woeful absence of discussion of the entity management problem both in our goals document and here on the list.  </s>
<s> So... let me as usual advance the minimalist position:  </s>
<s> XML offers only 4 kinds of external entities: the cross-product of  </s>
<s> (PUBLIC or SYSTEM) x (PCDATA or NDATA)  </s>
<s> PCDATA/NDATA offer little for discussion, you either parse it or you don't, right?  </s>
<s> SYSTEM entities, somebody at some point suggested outlawing them, and there are certainly good reasons for that, but in XML I think we'd like easy stuff to be easy, which SYSTEM does; it should be fenced around with stern warnings about nonportability.  </s>
<s> Which leaves PUBLIC.  </s>
<s> Any chance of getting away with saying "all PUBLIC entities are to be resolved by recourse to an SGML/Open Catalog, ref. 9401:1995"?  </s>
<s> It is now appropriate for James or someone who has built these things to step in and point out the woeful error of my ways.  </s>
<s> But someone had to kick it off.  </s>

<s> In every SGML system I have ever built, setup, or used, I have *never* used system entities.  </s>
<s> It will always lead to trouble.  </s>
<s> I would support banning them, but would concede to allowing them.  </s>
<s> There is a third type of entity to look at: system default.  </s>
<s> System default entities are a lookup by name.  </s>
<s> They are not very good for interchange but are excellent means for achieving system independence in a document without having to declare the entities explicitly.  </s>
<s> The reason why this is good is that in a internal publishing system, you could have thousands of entities (I have a client who has over 10000 separate language entities).  </s>
<s> In their internal use of entities, to declare all the possible entities that a document *could* use is practically speaking impossible--the parse of the document would take a *very* long time.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, there are three to decide on: 1. System entities (Explicit system ids--non-transportable). 2. System defaulted (Lookup by name).  </s>
<s> 3. Public entities (Lookup by public identifier).  </s>
<s> 2 &amp; 3 are covered by the SGML Open catalog format.  </s>
<s> In SGML open, 2 is: ENTITY foo "blah" 3 is: PUBLIC "-//Someone//DTD Something//EN" "somewhere" We should also embrace the concept of Formal System Identifiers.  </s>
<s> This would allow a document to push transport issues into the environment (catalogs) instead of being embedded in the document.  </s>
<s> For example, an HTML HREF could be: and the catalog entry could be: ENTITY DocumentFoo " URL http://mydomain.com/documentfoo.html"  </s>
<s> Of course, there's a little more to location-independent linking than the above.  </s>

<s> What about text entities vs. external text entities, vs. subdocument entities vs. some other fragment technology?  </s>
<s> Eliot Kimber has a vote in favour of subdocument entities at Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Entity management hasn't been mentioned because that discussion has been scheduled for a separate phase of design immediately following the November draft.  </s>
<s> The discussion, when it occurs, is expected to be complex and probably rather heated.  </s>
<s> Please defer all further consideration of this question until after the November WG meeting in Boston.  </s>
<s> Jon (as Chair)  </s>
<s> I would like to keep these as they can simplify the automatic generation of catalogs.  </s>
<s> The minimalist position would be to have no user-defined entities at all.  </s>
<s> Is this out of the question?  </s>
