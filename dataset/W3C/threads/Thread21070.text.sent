The installation did not crash. 
All window views synchronized. 
It is possible to save from the source view without crashing. 
The default Background Colour is A minor bug: A multiline PRE is synchronized on the beginning, not on the line. 
A mayor bug After Synchronizing from Source View Amaya hanged when scrolling down (May be it was because I saved from SOURCE View before, that was leading to a FREEZE all the time) (VIEWS open: Alternate, Source,Structure,Standard) HANGING / CRASHING is very annoying. 
So these bugs should be published on a special MEMO page as a warning. 
Jochem Heicke JHL Informations-Systeme GmbH Hi! Bugreport for Amaya 8.0 : (23-Apr-2003 W2K non-OpenGL) - Deeply nested tables rendering : example : http://www.tldp.org - i18n filenames on local drive : VERY longstanding bug (~1 year) It is impossible to open file with i18n characters in filename on W2K. -=AV=- From: Irene Vatton [mailto:irene.vatton@inrialpes.fr] 
On Fri, 25 Apr 2003 14:56:54 -0400 Another bug, this one very annoying in a minor way: 9. I encounter many instances that when (a) the cursor is before the first letter of a next word and after a space and the preceding word (b) and I hit the delete key (c) not only does it delete the first letter of the next word, but the preceding space. 
For example, where the carrot "^" represents the cursor position: "foo ^bar" [hit delete] "foo^ar" I made that test with Windows and Linux versions and the preceding space was not deleted. 
Could you send me the piece of HTML that shows this bug? 
Reading this, I had a similar experience in an HTML document. 
I can reproduce it with the default amaya startup page: Put the cursor at the beginning of a word in the middle of a line, space-character at the left side, word at the right side. 
Press the delete key and keep watching what happens in screen. 
As soon as there is also a space at the right side of the cursor and press delete once, both spaces are removed..... Amaya 8.0 for M$Windows 2000. 
M$Windows 2000 US-English.
