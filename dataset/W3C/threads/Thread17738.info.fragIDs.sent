<s> In the "navigation" sections of the guidelines and techniques it seems as though we primarily refer to sequential navigation.  </s>
<s> Has the concept of direct navigation been folded into searching?  </s>
<s> To me the notion of searching implies an extra step.  </s>
<s> While I think providing multiple ways to search for items on a page is important, I don't want to totally lose the concept of directly moving to a link or active element.  </s>
<s> What do people think?  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> Also, I am not sure what 5.6.3 means, "Allow the user to search for a link in the current document based on its position."  </s>
<s> Is this guideline a substitute for providing numbered links?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kitch  </s>
<s> I think the current guidelines put direct navigation into searching, since when it is discussed it usuaully refers to bring up a list of elements (i.e. links) and have the user use a numeric or aphabetic key board commands to move through the list.  </s>
<s> I am not sure there is a big distinction between this type of direct navigation and the general concept of searching.  </s>
<s> It potentially may be an easier sell, if it is discussed as searching (since many user agents already have search functions) than as some new keyboard based technique.  </s>
<s> What do people think about combining direct navigation with search functions?  </s>
