hello. 
i have updated the internet draft specifying fragment identifiers for text/plain resources. the draft's abstract reads: "This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain resources. 
These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text resource, identified by character count or range, line count or range, or a regular expression. 
These identification methods can be combined to identify more than one sub-resource of a text/plain resource." 
you can find the draft in text and html form in the usual internet draft archives (maybe after a one or two day delay) and at the following locations: for a list of open issues regarding the draft, please refer to section 1 of the draft. 
a change log describing the changes from previous versions can be found in section 7 of the draft. 
any comments are very welcome.

do, or do not. 
there is no try. 
* Please see I am adamently opposed to using ^ as an escape character when percent escaping is more than sufficient for that purpose. 
The carat isn't even allowed by the URI syntax. 
Use of balanced parentheses is a mistake. 
A simple left-to-right delimited syntax is easier to implement: fred#line=30;char=20-45 and then precent-escape ";" and "=" if needed as data. 
Parser reuse is a good thing. 
....Roy hello roy. 
thanks for your comments. 
pretty old, this one... i agree that parser reuse is a good thing. 
and this is why i chose the scheme syntax, which has been introduced by xpointer (and is very likely to be accepted as a w3c recommendation) and which is currently being worked on in draft-borden-frag-00. however, i am not religious about this, and i could also live with the admittedly simpler syntax you proposed. 
personally, i like the "traditional syntax" roy is voting for better than the "scheme-based syntax", but apart from escaping issues (which can be solved in both cases) it is mainly a matter of taste. 
and of guidelines, of course, iff draft-borden-frag-00 becomes the way how fragment iudentifiers will look in the future, then we should go with that option. 
any opinions?
