I hope this is the right place to ask this question. 
I am trying to run html-tidy on an NT machine (actually, I'd love to run it on a solaris box, but haven't succeeded in downloading that version). 
What I =want= to do, is to process the files such that they are written to a new directory, something like html-tidy in/*.txt  out/*.txt 
This is not working. 
I can redirect single files html-tidy in/foo.txt  
out/foo.txt but not wildcards. 
Beyond that, as may be evinced from the non-html file ending, what I'm =really= trying to do with this group of files is to process some text files that contain html, but which are not, in and of themselves html. 
In an ideal world, this would mean that I'd have a way to suppress the html header and footer, but I can find no way to do so. 
Is there anything to be done?

Try something like this: copy in\*.txt out cd out for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tity -m %%f It's been a long time since I did DOS; you may have to tweak the above to get it to work. 
Specifically, note that the following DOESN'T work: cd in for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tidy %%f  ..\out\%%f because the redirect is evaluated once for the entire "for..." command, not once for each file. 
In rough order of preference (which incidentally is the order they came to mind): * Get the solaris stuff working. 
:-) * Get bash/perl/sed/etc. 
for NT. * Install a small Linux on the NT box and use tidy/bash/perl/sed/etc. 
(but this requires turning your NT box into a dual boot machine and the down time my be unacceptable.) * Write something in Visual Basic to filter the files as needed.
