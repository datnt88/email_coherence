Hello comrades, Ever heard of pdf? 
It's a format capable of delivering high quality text for easy online reading. 
That is if the whole thing isn't ruined by visible link boxes! 
(that's hint number 1). 
Pdf doesn't have to be stuffed to be accessible on the web. 
Especially not in a mac-unfriendly gzip format. 
(that's hint number 2). 
I have tried both on a Mac and on a PC to download the HTML401 spec in pdf format. 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/html40.pdf.gz) 
In both cases I get error messages that say the file is corrupted. 
Please, don't be geeky and give us the plain pdf and loose the visible link boxes in the file. 
And if you must compress do it in formats that can be read. 
Sorry, pissed off.

I cannot answer your first comment, but I can answer your second one. 
GZIP is an encoding format describe in RFC1952 which has been developped to be platform independent. 
It is one of the 4 content coding listed in the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616, section 3.5) and is served as such by our Web server: Content-Encoding: gzip Content-Length: 962329 Content-Type: application/pdf; qs=0.001 
As far as I know, most of the programs able to uncompress ZIP files can uncompress GZIP files (WinZip for example - I am not a Mac person so I can't speak about Macs). 
The file sometimes _appears_ to be corrupted because the Web browser uncompresses the file on the fly and names it html40.pdf.gz whereas once uncompressed it is PDF and should most likely be named html40.pdf, or doesn't modify the file and names it html40.pdf 
instead of html40.pdf.gz since in this case it is still GZIP'ed (I have seen such behaviors on PCs). 
Basically, we are compressing the PDF file to save bandwidth and reduce the downloading time (the file would be 3 times bigger uncompressed) in a standard way. 
Regards, Hugo Hugo Haas, Webmaster, Systems Team - W3C/MIT I just noticed that those problems are documented in the HTML 4 errata[1]: 7. Gzipped PDF file problematic on Macs Added: 26 Jan 2000 Type: Document Issue Refers to: 24 Dec 1999 version. 
Description: When unzipped, the PDF format of the specification may cause problems on Adobe Acrobat on MacIntoshes. 
Correction: Try using the Postscript format. 
The PDF format will not be gzipped in future versions. 
12. Unzipping PDF/PS on Windows Added: 28 April 2000 Type: Document Problem Refers to: 24 Dec 1999 version, Gzipped PDF version (as well as PS, I presume). 
Description: Problem unzipping html40.pdf.gz. 
Correction: There is no problem with the gzipped PDF file. 
If you are having problems unzipping the file it may be that Windows has already unzipped it for you during the download. 
In this case, simply remove the ".gz" suffix from the file and view it with your PDF viewer.
