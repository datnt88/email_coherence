<s> Typically, this implementation-defined timezone will be the local timezone, which in many countries is not the same in winter and in summer, due to Daylight Saving Time.  </s>
<s> So the expression xs:date("2004-01-01") wont correspond with the same UTC time if it is computed in winter or summer.  </s>
<s> However, it is a bit odd to apply a summer timezone (DST) to a winter date ... It seems that it should depend on the date itself, shouldn't it ?  </s>
<s> And actually, this is what happens for example with Java classes: if you parse "2004-01-01" with the appropriate java.text.DateFormat, you dont get the same difference to GMT as you get when parsing "2004-06-01".  </s>
<s> This can be a practical issue in XQuery applications.  </s>
<s> By the way, if somebody can explain me what is the meaning of a timezone applied to a DATE, s/he is welcome.  </s>
<s> I understand of course the meaning of a timezone applied to a dateTime, but would anybody say "Christmas 2004 CST, not to be confused with Christmas 2004 GMT " ?  </s>
<s> Treat the implicit timezone as a best guess.  </s>
<s> Any application that wants to do timezone handling properly is going to have to do it explicitly.  </s>
<s> Inferring the implicit timezone from the actual date/time gives all sorts of problems: when the clocks are put back at the end of summer, the dateTime values for one hour occur twice.  </s>
<s> What timezone would you infer for the dateTimes in this interval?  </s>
<s> And what about times with no associated date?  </s>
<s> The chances are that in a bus timetable, the raw time "11:15" probably means 11:15 summer time in summer, and 11:15 winter time in winter, so it is not really a time that recurs every 24 hours at all.  </s>
<s> If this matters to you, you can't use times-without-timezones to represent this data.  </s>
<s> This isn't the end of the world, there are plenty of other good ways of representing it.  </s>
<s> There's very little point in getting into more and more complexity on date and time handling.  </s>
<s> It will never be perfect.  </s>
<s> The addition of timezones to dates is an example of the nonsense you get when you go down this route - someone pointed out that Christmas Day in New Zealand is not the same period of 24 hours as Christmas Day in South Africa, which is logically true, so you end up with all this additional machinery to solve a theoretical problem, which no-one will ever use in practice.  </s>

<s> This was OK for summer dates but not for winter dates...)
