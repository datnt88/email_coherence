Hello, I've published the 1 November implementation report [1]. 
This document is very incomplete since it has not been kept up since Proposed Recommendation. 
It may contain out of date and incorrect information, and I hope the WG will contribute to its revival. 
Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20001101/ Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Ian, Did you use any of the information from what Jim [1], Rich [2] and I [3,4] sent?

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Jon, Yes, I saw it go by, and stored it in a corner for when I have a chance to integrate it. 
I published this version just so the WG would have something to look at and to detect weak areas of support.
