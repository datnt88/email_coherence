Lately I seem to be on an unintentional crusade to convert all of Tidy's errors into warnings. 
:) I think the error "missing quotemark for attribute value" (search for "SUSPECTED_MISSING_QUOTE" in lexer.c) could be changed to a warning. 
I've tried this in Java Tidy. 
The lexer continues just fine after this condition is detected. 
The resulting attribute value agrees with IE and Netscape. 
(IE and Netscape appear to accept any number of newlines and unencoded " " and " " inside of quoted attribute values. 
Of course, Tidy will output " " and " " as properly encoded entities, which IE and Netscape also accept.) Am I overlooking something? 
Randy HTML 4.0 or perhaps 4.01 requires the quotes. 
They are not optional there.

- - Sorry if I was unclear. 
Tidy divides its complaints into two categories: warnings and errors. 
Both identify illegal/deprecated/etc. 
constructs that authors should be aware of. 
The key difference is that errors prevent Tidy from producing an output document. 
This is crucial for some applications (like ours! 
:) ). 
Almost all of Tidy's complaints are warnings. 
I think this is what makes HTML Tidy so valuable. 
There are other HTML "verifiers" out there, but they do not "tidy"; to them everything is an error. 
With that point of view, the more Tidy can issue warnings rather than errors, the better. 
So my question is: Everything seems to be in place for Tidy to treat a missing quotemark as a warning, yet Tidy is treating it as an error. 
Is this an oversight or perhaps a vestige of earlier versions? 
Or have I overlooked something and/or are my assumptions faulty? 
Thanks, Randy
