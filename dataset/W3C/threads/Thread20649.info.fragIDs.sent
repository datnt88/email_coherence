Is there a configuration method for setting window size and/or position for specific windows. 
Or can they be made to retain resized/repositioned information. 
Why I ask is that the help window always opens unmaxed and I would prefer maxed. 
Even after maxing it and then closing it it opens unmaxed. 
Just a personal GUI thing I guess but is it doable.

Amin's suggestion worked for normal resize/reposition but unfortunately does not for the MAXing operation which is how I wish the HELP window to open. 
Thanks anyway -- any other solution that works for MAX as well ???? 
After opening, positioning and resizing your windows the way you want them, go via: Special - Preferences... - Window Geometry - Save current geometry Unfortunately you have to do that for each window.

As a workaround you could resize the HELP-window manually as close as possible to MAX and the save the window geometry.

Today Help pages are considered as simple documents, so they are open with same size parameters as other documents.
