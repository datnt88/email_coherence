<s> Is there a configuration method for setting window size and/or position for specific windows.  </s>
<s> Or can they be made to retain resized/repositioned information.  </s>
<s> Why I ask is that the help window always opens unmaxed and I would prefer maxed.  </s>
<s> Even after maxing it and then closing it it opens unmaxed.  </s>
<s> Just a personal GUI thing I guess but is it doable.  </s>

<s> Amin's suggestion worked for normal resize/reposition but unfortunately does not for the MAXing operation which is how I wish the HELP window to open.  </s>
<s> Thanks anyway -- any other solution that works for MAX as well ????  </s>
<s> After opening, positioning and resizing your windows the way you want them, go via: Special - Preferences... - Window Geometry - Save current geometry Unfortunately you have to do that for each window.  </s>

<s> As a workaround you could resize the HELP-window manually as close as possible to MAX and the save the window geometry.  </s>
