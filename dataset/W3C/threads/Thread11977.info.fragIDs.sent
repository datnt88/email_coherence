<s> Proposed checkpoints: 2.4.X [Priority 2] Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting choices for the author.  </s>

<s> 2.4.X [Priority 1] Ensure that accessibility features can be easily accessed by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion.  </s>
<s> TECHNIQUES: Include considerations for accessibility -- such as the ALT and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG element -- right below the SRC attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an "Advanced..." button.  </s>

<s> TECHNIQUES: Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core operation of the authoring tool.  </s>
<s> The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring tool should favor accessible solutions out of the box, for the benefit of newer users.  </s>

<s> I like it.  </s>
<s> I think some examples should be added to the techniques, but it is a little late in Boston and I have an early start, so I might work on them tomorrow.  </s>

<s> On reflection, I think the last two are the same checkpoint expressed in different words.  </s>
<s> I like all the techniques Kynn has given, and think I like the wording of the third checkpoint better than the wording of the second - the wording of the second could be a technique for the third.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I have added some more technique suggestions - look for CMN: and KB: Charles McCN [background discussion snipped] 2.4.X [Priority 2] Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting choices for the author.  </s>
<s> TECHNIQUE: If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and make it the default.  </s>
<s> CMN: For example, When requesting alternative content for an image, offer an unchecked option for empty alternative (ie ALT="" - the image has no real function) with the cursor positioned in the text entry for an ALT value, rather than offering the filename as a default suggestion, with the null ALT value selected.  </s>

<s> CMN: Examples: A help page which describes how to make an imagemap should include adding alternative content for each AREA in the MAP as part of the process.  </s>
<s> Any examples of code should give either block content with text links, or AREAs which all have relevant ALT attribute values.  </s>
<s> When a user creates a frameset, suggest the main content page and a navigation bar as the content for NOFRAMES.  </s>
