I apologize if this is off topic, but I didn't know where else to turn. 
Really, if you know of a more appropriate forum, I'd be happy to hear of it. 
Anyhow, I'm dealing with a form in a table cell. 
However, both Netscape and IE seem to want to insert a carriage return after /FORM :(. 
On work-around seems to be to include the FORM tags outside of the TD tags. 
And, yes, I know that's not legal HTML -- that's why I'm actively looking for a better solution ;). Below is a short file which demonstrates this problem. 
Any ideas?

Richard Allsebrook: That will help unless that particular table is to harbour more than one form, as I suspect might be the case. 
One question that Alex has to ask himself is if this data is really a table. 
"table" is for tabular data, not for layout. 
If it's just layout that your after, Alex, then ask yourself if it can be done without table entirely, or at least will minimal use of tables. 
Perhaps you'll wind ut with just one table per form. 
In any case the extra white space after the form can be gotten rid of in MSIE4/5 by including this style sheet info: form { margin-bottom: 0; } Nescape 4 pays little attention to that, but who really cares about Netscape 4 these days?
