<s> Hello! I would like to submit some ideas for future Amaya versions, regarding basic editing.  </s>
<s> I wish amaya would - allow repetion of previous command - allow column selection - allow application of a command/attribute to a selection and apply it to the adequate element within.  </s>
<s> For example, select a row and apply commands to cells.  </s>

<s> Yes!  </s>
<s> Maybe at first we'll be happy with an "Apply to all cells in row | column | table" choice that seems much easier to implement.  </s>
<s> As of the repetition command, the vi editor has the "." command to  </s>
<s> repeat what you have just done, while Word and Excel have F4 for the same puepose.  </s>
<s> All of them are very useful.  </s>
<s> Imagine being in the structure view, selecting elements and clicking a key to apply the same edit sequence to the newly selected element!  </s>
<s> Fantastic!  </s>
