Interesting question. 
At the moment there is no way to make this happen on the client side - you always need some kind of server-side solution (such as the submenu, although there are fancier things you could do which would hit your server harder). 
You could make this more directly accesssible for those with script-capable browsers by adding an onfocus method, but I need to think for a minute how that works for turning things off (since the focus will shift to a bit of the submenu...). 
It might not be very easy to do this in HTML. 
An interesting question is that use of submenus that are not available on the main page unless you process scripts, and the effect this has on the accessibility of the site. 
The obvious issue is that you are required to use a different navigation path if you have a browser that canot handle scripts. 
But then, you can use both paths if you do handle scripts. 
thoughts anyone? 
Charles McCN Charles, Thanks for the useful info. 
Expanding my question into an area where my knowledge is limited, is it possible to make pop-up menus that are generated by a mouseover accessible? 
An example is the main menu at http://webaim.org (accessibility note: though the pop-up menus on this page may not be directly accessible, an equivalent to the menus is provided in the form of a submenu on each page). 
Is there a way to make the pop-up menu directly accessible so that an alternative (submenu) does not need to be provided? 
Thanks, Crystal Allen Making HTML 4 mouseover effects accessible to keyboard users is pretty trivial - add an onfocus/onblur to each element that matches the onmouseover/onmouseout. 
Making the effects accessible is more complex. 
It is still important not to rely on the effects of scripts for providing people with important functionality, but there are a couple of thigs you can do. 
THe goal would be to ensure that the alternative content provided for an image was updated at the same time as the image was changed by a mouseover. 
There are other uses where there is only "accessible" content being affected in the first place, and in that case the important thing is that the user know what is going to happen, rather than beng surprised by the way a page works benig changed seemingly arbitrarily. 
Although many blind users do not use a mouse, most computers have them , and particularly in the case of touch-pad mice such as are ommon on laptops, the user may not know where the mouse is. 
(Or they may have been using mousekeys, and know precisely where it is...) Sorry that this is only a partial answer for the moment. 
regards Charles McCN Is there a way to make mouseovers accessible? 
If anyone could enlighten me with a technique to do this it would be much appreciated.

The issues surrounding inclusion of Javascript and accessibility are a little confusing. 
I'm looking to the list for clarification. 
What types/elements of scripts seem to be at issue? 
I know mouseovers are accessible if tagged correctly. 
However, I've heard negative feedback related to using Javascript forms. 
Any info on this subject is greatly appreciated. 
I've included a specific example of a script I'm checking for accessibility. 
It generates a rotating list of links on the home page. 
Any feedback related to the accessibility is welcome.

The work-around that I created used style sheets and scripting. 
When scripts are on, the submenu would appear after a mouse click (rather than mouse over) or a keyboard event (pressing the enter key). 
This event caused the submenu, as defined as a style sheet "layer," to be displayed. 
When scripts are off style sheets are also not loaded and the submenus appear with the menu bar in an outline.

I have been hoping to get back to it for a while but have not. 
comments? 
anyone want to play with it? 
help me bring it up to date?

wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa I wanted to make one additional point with regard to cognitive disabilities and a suggestion. 
Apologies in advance to those who find this all far too obvious. 
It's not just that content and tools need to work together to support the individual but we must also consider: 1. 
The purpose or intent of the page author, and 2. the purpose or intent of the page/site visitor (reader, learner, etc.). 
Otherwise, it is impossible to measure the importance of various cognitive style and ability differences. 
Since this is all likely to become quite complex, I would suggest beginning with a simple approach. 
Using CAST's UDL framework, I am attempting to categorize some of the key cognitive topics. 
This needs more work but I think I should put something out there. 
As the discussion with iconic representations shows, this work will not be easy and great caution must be exercised lest these efforts are seen by others as extreme or goofy. 
My suggestion is to take a list of cognitive topics and attempt to agree on a few that are likely to create the most significant barriers for the greatest number of users. 
This may require a bit of guesswork but I suspect that stepping back from the details of one approach or issue may prove productive.
