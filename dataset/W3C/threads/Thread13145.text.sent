Reminder: Several e-mails to the eo list identify policies that haven't made it to the Policy page yet. 
I had sent to eo what I learned about several countries: 1. India policies on web accessibility (2/14/2003f rom Sailesh Panchang) 2. Hong Kong Digital 21 Policy (2/16/2003 from Yammie) Natasha had sent policies: 3. FW: Internet Accessibility in Poland (2/24/2003) 4. Russian accessibility laws (2/14/2003) We may have failed to get these on the wai-eo-editors list, so they were never recorded. 
Hello Harvey, Thanks for the reminder. 
As of now, India does not have anything like a policy on Web accessibility. 
This was confirmed by a few leaders in the IT field in India too. 
Unfortunately it does not seem to be on anyone's agenda. 
They all say that India has other priorities and a lot of pressing issues like improving literacy levels, providing drinking water and removal of poverty etc. 
I reasoned that ensuring Web accessibility will facilitate access to education and to work even if physical accessibility is limited. 
So it will help raies literacy levels and reduce poverty levels. 
But rights of people with disabilities is not high on anyone's priority and it does not get consistent support from the government by way of political will as well as funding. 
Assistive technology (especially computer access technology) is virtually unknown in India . 
A policy for funding AT is also absent.

Bolivia does not have any policy regarding accessibility. 
Discrimination is still one issue not solved. 
Recently some projects to carry Information Technology to rural areas got some funding but making accessibility part of these projects will take a long time.
