<s> nearly six centuries ago, people have been organizing information page by page.  </s>
<s> Even in the computer age, they still are doing it on Web pages.  </s>
<s> That perplexed researchers at the University of West Florida's Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, which works to make computers more useful and user-friendly.  </s>
<s> "Why should we organize it as pages?  </s>
<s> There's no reason," said associate director Alberto Canas.  </s>
<s> "It's just that we're used to it."

<s> "If you can do something about helping humans better exploit the sort of information ghetto on the Web, you've got lots of customers," said institute director Ken Ford.  </s>

<s> The patented software is written in the Java computer language and runs on a variety of operating systems including Windows, Mac and variations of Unix.  </s>
<s> Government agencies, schools, students and others using the software for nonprofit purposes can download it free from the institute's website.  </s>
<s> The software is not yet available for commercial use, though the  </s>
<s> institute is  </s>
<s> considering licensing it and has been approached by private companies.  </s>
<s> One of them is Cincinnati-based Cincom Inc., which is seeking licensing rights for software it designs for manufacturers.  </s>
<s> "We have looked at everything we can find that is similar, or designed for the purpose of knowledge management, and we find concept mapping to be light-years ahead," said Barry Brosch, a senior consultant with Cincom.  </s>

<s> "Mars" appears in a red box at the top with lines connecting it to related concepts including "Search for Evidence of Life," "Exploration Strategy,"  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> even "Science Fiction." Clicking on concept box icons can open additional maps or provide links to appropriate websites.  </s>
<s> "That's a powerful means, from my perspective, of communicating information and giving people an immediate grasp of the subject," Briggs said.  </s>
<s> He also wants to use Cmaps to brainstorm the selection of Mars landing  </s>
<s> sites.  </s>
<s> Scientists each could do a concept map on a preferred site and then discuss, compare and criticize each other's ideas by computer.  </s>
<s> The software was developed as part of a broader $6 million federally funded project that includes the creation of related tools for NASA and the Navy, which plans to use concept maps for on-the-job training aboard ships.  </s>
<s> The software also has advanced the original purpose of Cmaps, said Joseph Novak, who developed the idea about 25 years ago while at Cornell  </s>
<s> University,  </s>
<s> where he is a professor emeritus of education and biology.  </s>
<s> It has been used to help education researchers present large amounts of data in a concise and cogent way, and for course planning and knowledge-sharing.  </s>
<s> It is also used to assess students, by having them build Cmaps.  </s>
<s> Other concept-mapping software is available commercially, including Inspiration by Inspiration Software Inc., Decision Explorer by Banaxia Software Ltd., MindManager by Mindjet and VisiMap by CoCo Systems Ltd.  </s>
<s> The institute's version has the advantage of being free for nonprofit uses, schools all over globe have used it, and its features include a method for easy access to other Web sources, said Novak, a senior research scientist at West Florida.  </s>
<s> "All the fundamental assumptions that underlie concept-mapping have been embedded in the ways in which the software works," Novak said.  </s>
<s> "It facilitates building them the way they ought to be built."  </s>
