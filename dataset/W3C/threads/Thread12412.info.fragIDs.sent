Per meeting today, attached are some more forthcoming conferences from DCI and GCA. 
I have little basis for evaluation of DCI conferences, though sessions scattered through them deal with web issues. 
Can anyone else speak to these. 
The GCA ones I've attended for 12 years. 
As these have been the forebears of structured markup (SGML) and continuations (HTML, XML families), and generally have both management and technical content, I will continue to advocate there for accessibility. 
Murray Altheim, Jon Bosak, Tim Bray, George Kerscher, Eve Maler, Murray Maloney, Mike Paciello, Michael Sperberg-McQueen, Jutta Treviranus, and many others participate in these and are accessibility advocates. 
I did not list next week's Metadata and XML Developers conferences in Montreal, as it is too late to attend those.

I'm afraid I started an interesting thread on the Computer Book Publishing listserve and the subject of the ADA mandating Web sites be accessible has come up. 
I remember someone talking about a court ruling where the judge found that an organization must make their Web site accessible. 
Can anyone cite the case for me?? B.K. DeLong 360 Huntington Ave. 
Director Suite 140SC-305 New England Chapter Boston, MA 02115 National Association (617) 247-3753 of Webmasters bkdelong@naw.org 
NAW is the North American "chapter" of the World Organization of Webmasters 
Hi B.K., That was me, citing US DOJ OCR _opinion_, Sept 1996, ADA Title II and Title III entities need to have their Web sites accessible, not a court ruling, listed in National Disability Law Reporter Sept 1997 issue. 
ADA itself passed in 1990 and so pre-dates Web. 
Policy area of EOWG to be organized &amp; available in draft within the next 2 weeks or so, in the meantime can go to WAI Interest Group archive linked from http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG and look for mail from Jan-March 1998 sent by Cynthia Waddell, which lists &amp; discusses the ruling. 
Or I'll send a better pointer later this weekend.

Harvey, Thanks for listings, and regarding DCI, B.K. will be attending, also Geoff Freed (WGBH/NCAM) and Philipp Hoschka (W3C) will be talking about SMIL &amp; accessibility at an NAW breakfast there. 
I plan to attend but will not be presenting at any DCI sessions.
