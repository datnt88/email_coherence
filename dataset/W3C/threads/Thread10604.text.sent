I have removed all documents from my public website which look anything like a W3C official document. 
All the URLs in the email archive referring to 'editors' versions of the semantics document for the past 9 months or so will now take you to an explanatory document which points to what I devoutly hope will be the final version, archived at If anyone wishes to check any details, all the original documents are available, but they should now be of interest only to a particularly obsessive kind of historian. 
Many thanks to everyone who contributed to getting this done.

Sorry for replying to this message. 
This does not seem to be the proper link: it is the PR version, complete with the errors recently corrected in the RDFS entailment lemma and the definition of D-interpretations. 
Shouldn't it be the following link: Although this link contains the year 2003, it is the link from the explanatory document that you mention above, and from the editor's version on the RDF Core page; this document does contain the corrections I just mentioned. 
Herman Yes, sorry. 
That is the version that the document points to, in fact.
