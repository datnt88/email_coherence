<s> I've been experimenting with ways to ensure that a screen reader will read the correct text for things like edit boxes and such on forms.  </s>
<s> If I exclude the table references in the below example I hear all the text read as a prompt.  </s>
<s> If I include the table references I only hear the direct instruction to enter a name.  </s>
<s> What's the best way to code things so a screen reader will only read the direct instruction?  </s>
<s> Is my method acceptable?  </s>

<s> Hi Kelly, this seems like a bug in your screen reader, although the code as included here is not valid.  </s>
<s> The table should not appear inside a paragraph, and you need the closing tag for the form... Cheers Charles Hi All, Again if there are pointers on this please direct me to appropriate resources.  </s>

<s> Hi Charles, Do you know why http://validator.w3.org would accept the code I mentioned as valid?  </s>
<s> I copied what I shared here from a longer document at http://www.teleport.com/~kford/formtest.htm that shows as a valid document when I test it.  </s>
<s> That document has the closing form tag and such but the table and paragraph stuff is identical to what I shared here.  </s>

<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> That would be a bug in the validator.  </s>
<s> (Albeit a fairly minor one, assuming the form element is closed in the original.) Unless I am interpreting SGML too strictly.  </s>
<s> The nice thing about XML is unambiguous syntax.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
