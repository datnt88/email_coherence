Hi, I wondered whether I can include verbosemsg.cfg 
into my toolbar and tried to review it. 
That's basically not possible without prior 
pre-processing. 
I am not sure why all these messages are included there, it is most unlikely that that our users will ever see a message like 
character number %1 cannot be assigned to LCNMCHAR, UCNMCHAR, LCNMSTRT or UCNMSTRT because it is RS 
I neither really understand why there is the same "Help Wanted!" text over and over and over again, or why this is stored in such a odd 
format. 
Maybe this saves a few lines of code... Can we change this to an XML format and only include the messages that actually have code? 
We could use to easy processing, but all this "Help Wanted!" should be inferred from check, not hardcoded, and I guess we can still parse the format using 
regular expressions if we follow some rules for the content. 
Maybe this "Help Wanted!" stuff is really the wrong approach, maybe we should maintain this stuff in the Wiki and point to the wiki for people who want to help. 
This would of course need some moderation... 
regards. 
I asked myself similar questions when working on the beta2 recently. 
I think the current (annoying, perhaps) display of "can you find a better explanation" could be made less visible when we move to release. 
In the meantime, if seeing it motivates people to contribute more explanation messages, good for us and them. 
As for the format, I (as main editor of the messages, at least recently) would also be happier with a simpler design for the file. 
I wish I had more ideas for the "help wanted". 
The list isn't such a bad thing for that purpose, especially given how few we receive. 
Ideas welcome, I may tweak the code, though certainly not today... olivier

The current "Help Wanted" blurb was always intended to only be there for the Beta. 
For production the intent was to either remove it completely or tone it down to one short sentence/link. 
The format of the file is what Config::General uses, and is supposed to be reminiscent of Apache config file syntax. 
Using a homebrew config parser is not an option as far as I'm concerned (BTDT), and since we need 
Config::General for the other config files it makes little sense to have a custom parser for just the verbose messages resource file. 
However, the Config::General syntax is very flexible so it may well be that we can do what you want even within those confines.

They are there because when we started out we had _zero_ explanations and needed a good list of possibles to start from. 
That file is automatically generated from OpenSP source, so it is canonical in a sense. 
It was a tradeoff. 
By embedding the Help Wanted text into the Perl code you make future developments in the file format/features and l10n more difficult; and locks us in to the specific HTML format used in the message. 
I'm not sure the tradeoff fell down on the "right" side (but neither am I convinced it's "wrong" today!). 
All work on the file format should take into account Flexibility, i18n, and what effect it has on forward and backward compatibility between versions. 
Not that that would prevent the things you've suggested here, but... Editor's note: in the last update, we noted that Larry Wall would "vomment" on existing RFCs. 
Some took that to be a cross between "vomit" and "comment." 
We are unsure of whether it was a subconscious slip or a typographical error. 
We are also unsure of whether or not to regret the error.
