Hi, I think it is a natural question to ask how many web users, or potential web users, are disabled, but I am also unconvinced it is relevant when so many of the guidelines are aimed at improving access for those working 'eyes free' or 'hands free'. 
Also, I'm not sure there are reliable sources of statistics. 
However, I am concerned that if there is no explanation of how special devices might render elements / attributes effectively, authors may develop inaccurate models, as I described before. 
I agree that such information does not need to be in the Guidelines. 
Chetz CMN: I am always concerned by people asking what proposrtion of web users are disabled. 
To my mind, the question is irrelevant - the point is that SOME are ... As I see it, the primary purpose of these guidelines is to explain how to do what I have called good design, not why to design things for disabled users. 
Thorough explanations of what the problems are, and how the solutions proposed work, is valuable and should also be made avilable as a tool used for verifying whether the guidelines achieve what they set out to achieve. 
It seems to me that it shouldbe included in associated documentation such as the techniques document rather than in teh guidelines themselves.

So the real important thing is to achieve awareness about the keyproblems and achieve consensus on how to solve, reduce or avoid them. 
That is what is relevant! 
Even if the figures mentioned in this article pointed to below are true for only 50% they are still impressive enough. 
The main problems are descibed pretty good in general I think. 
met vriendelijke groet / with kind regards, Henk Wittingen - Ede gld - NL I think the issue is not how many people with disabilities are using the WWW, but how many could if it was more accessible. 
I compare the WWW to a public building. 
If there were no ramps into buildings or curbcuts on the sidewalks to get to the building you will never see a wheelchair user in the building. 
If the WWW is not more accessible to people with certain types of disabilities they will not use it very much. 
In todays information oriented society people with disabilities ideally need to have the same access to information technology as their able-bodied peers.
