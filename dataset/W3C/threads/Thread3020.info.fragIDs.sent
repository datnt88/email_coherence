Has there been an IETF last call for draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00? 
I cannot find one in the archives. 
ID Tracker lists says the draft status is "ID Exists", suggesting that there has not been an IETF last call yet. 
Can anybody post an update on the draft current status and plans? 
Thanks, Alex. 
Anyone hear from Jim Gettys lately? 
I thought he was going to march through the errata and create an issues list, but I haven't heard anything in a long time. 
Yes, Larry, I exist... I've responded privately to a number of people over the last few months.... 
Without knowing whether the area directors want to move the spec's further soon and/or knowing the state of specifications we depend on that block it, I've been blissfully ignoring the problem, on the theory that fewer drafts are better, both in terms of work and in terms of the probability of getting people to read drafts. 
I haven't heard many complaints on the new draft go by since I issued it. 
Should I pay attention again? 
Can we find out what the area directors want and/or the state of specs we depend on?
