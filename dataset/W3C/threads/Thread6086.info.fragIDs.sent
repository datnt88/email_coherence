<s> To: Our organization has been looking at acquiring a web-services management platform but need clarification on several thoughts.  </s>
<s> Should the management platform provide orchestration capability so that the  </s>

<s> Request was refering to a client posting a SOAP message to a services management platform endpoint.  </s>
<s> The incoming SOAP message needs to be broken into 1..n parts and routed separately to different services.  </s>
<s> Likewise each service will return a message that needs to be merged back into a single outgoing SOAP message.  </s>

<s> I do not consider it as an answer to my question: What do you mean by "request"?  </s>
<s> However, generally you are right that a complex client's request (task) may be broken into a number of sub-requests and routed separately to different services.  </s>
<s> Some of these services (if they are composite) may again decompose the sub-request into sub-sub-requests and send separately to different services, and so on recursively.  </s>
<s> Note that these different services may come from different providers / vendors.  </s>
<s> Hence, there MUST be *platform independent* uniform standard way/language to express requests.  </s>
<s> There is an attempt in this direction, see M. Papazoglou, M. Aiello, M. Pistore, and J. Yang.  </s>
<s> XSRL: A Request Language for Web Services.  </s>
<s> Published at However, specs of XSRL are not available.  </s>
<s> IMO the concept of request is crucial for web services technology.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this very issue should be addressed by W3C and the "great" IT vendors instead of trying to recover dying or already dead technologies.  </s>
