In working on the 2.0 comments it became clear that there were a number of big issues that needed to be addressed. 
We referred to them as the Elephant Issues. 
We therefore stopped to gather them. 
Here is the list we came up with. 
#4 is missing because we later determined that it was a duplicate with 
number 13 1. 
Baseline browser capabilities - in general 
- in specific contexts (intranet, public kiosk) 2. User literacy level 3. Differences by language 
5. How document is interpreted by non-technical people 
6. Implementation 7. Normative vs. informative (do we need normative?) 
8. One version for all vs. multiple versions of web content 
- client-side vs. server-side 
- reading levels 
9. Access for absolutely all? 
- If not, how to draw line 
10. Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites 
11. Do we intend guidelines to be used by regulators and requirements-setters (e.g., in companies)? 
12. Accessibility vs. usability 
13. Conformance - why do it? 
How to test? 
14. Author and user needs conflict 
15. User and user needs conflict 
16. What is an equivalent? 
We then discussed these and tried to determine where there seemed to be consensus and where not. 
The following items are grouped into three categories. 1 ? 
Those that there was consensus on 2 - Those that there was some sentiment for but the group was not comfortable yet -- more discussion tomorrow 3 ? 
Those that there definitely was not consensus on and there is unlikely to be 1 ? 
THOSE ITEMS WHERE THERE WAS CONSENSUS IN THE GROUP AND WHICH ARE POSTED TO THE LIST FOR DISCUSSION - That what we develop should be usable by people who are writing 
regulations or requirements or policies (government, company, agency 
etc.) This is not the ONLY group - but it is one group we need to address. 
- That our guidelines should not necessarily be directly usable or adoptable as regulations 
- That our guidelines should have a "harmonizing" effect on regulations 
-- so that they cause regulations to be written so that they are similar 
and create similar or at least compatible demands on companies and 
individuals who must follow the regulations or standards or policies. 
- we shouldn?t 
be including anything (as normative) that we can't provide techniques and examples for. 
- that technology specific checkpoints should be normative - that ?testable by a tool? 
should NOT be required for normative items - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in the different forms and it is all available through the same URI (though it may be linked to it). 
(server side solutions are acceptable ? 
as specified) - it is good to have levels of conformance rather than just all or nothing. 
- there is a minimum set that conformance should not be possible without. 
- we want to have recognition for accomplishment beyond baseline - we WCAG should provide a way for people to see impact of items for particular disabilities but it should not be used for conformance. 
(see requirement 5) 
- GL should provide hooks in WCAG to allow someone to provide a way for people to measure access against particular disabilities but it should 
not be used for conformance. 
[GL or EO or ?] [Separate tool] 2 - CANDIDATE CONSENSUS STATEMENTS ITEMS THAT WERE MENTIONED BUT GROUP HAS NOT CONSENSED ON. NOTE: THERE IS NO AGREEMENT YET ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS - we shouldn?t 
be including anything (as normative) that we can't provide success criteria for. 
- normative is determined by objectiveness -- ease of establishing consensus on fulfillment. 
- things that are normative must be testable. 
(Testing not equal to machine testing) - (testable and non testable ok? 
If separate????) - things that are not normative should be in a separate doc. 
(or at 
least not listed as guidelines) (not remove from guidelines, keep it prominent, but make 
separate/clear/??? that it is different.) - that our guidelines should not be limited to only that information that could or should be required today. 
They should talk as well about what would make web content more accessible where and when it is possible - even if it is not possible everywhere today. 
But it should 
be clear what things are which (what is possible and reasonable today for general application vs what may be possible in the future or applicable only on some sites). 
THREE ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSED. 
- conformance levels should be based on user needs only (and not ease of implementation or ease of measurement/testing) - conformance levels should take user factors and testability into account. 
- conformance levels should take user factors and testability and ease into account. 
(at least on a gross scale). 
- conformance should be linear 3 ? 
THE FOLLOWING ARE THINGS THAT THE GROUP REJECTED (THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY UNANIMOUSLY) - normative items should be determined by how easy it is to test. 
(in time and effort)??? - we should be able to claim conformance by disability - priority should be determined by ease of implementation (and testing?) there was also no agreement on how to separate information that is more important from that which is less important. 
Discussions will continue tomorrow.

I am not sure about 'tell(more show) them what you know'. 
can we have a website that is so demonstratably great that it shines? 
yet also on careful analysis is easily understood, and replicated in parts. 
Providing links to examples is a fine step, if not ideally as organically holistic as it might be.

on the web" 
Just a few quick thoughts. 
These issues are pretty tightly interdependent. 
There is one example in here were a top-down analysis suggests that a world-wide norm is not something we can gain acceptance for. 
This is in the language diversity area. 
Language diversity is highly political.? Political units have policies in this regard and the policies vary.? I seriously doubt that we as W3C can set a 'mondiale' standard of service in this respect and have it adopted around the world in place of the local-option existing policies given that language is so closely tied to cultural differences that are the subject of bitter emnity and mortal conflict. 
Likewise, there is a bottom-up argument for why a world-wide setting of a standard of service is not something that can be sold off as justified by a technical analysis. 
Take point 9, "access for absolutely all?"? 
The question is where do you stop laying demands on the content providers for pockets of the underserved with smaller and smaller counts? 
Or at least I am going to examine the question as if it were taken in that sense. 
There is a school of policy analysis we might call economic rationalism that says one sound rule for stopping adapting the automatic means of service delivery at the point where the cost of providing personal assistance to deliver service to the remaining underserved is less than the cost of upgrading 
the technologized service to reach this population.? The cost of providing personal assistance as opposed to technology varies radically across economies around the globe.? So the point at which this cost exchange flips sign is very locale dependent. 
If we try to set a standard for service, we know we find we have a great deal of trouble agreeing amongst ourselves.? There is some evidence to suggest that when we are done it is not clear to others there is a compelling reason why they should take our answer.? If we focus our efforts on delivering a service which provides factual answers to questions concerning what content strategies have, or avoid, what access problems, and leave threshold setting to duly constituted policy setters, we may have reduced our problem to something where we can close more rapidly on agreement amongst ourselves, and we find our results are eagerly grabbed off the presses.

9. Access for absolutely all? 
- If not, how to draw line 
WL: If it's cheaper to hire a human "screen reader" (assistive techbology "wife 2.0") than to buy a software one ("JAWS 9.x") then we don't need WCAG? 
12. Accessibility vs. usability 
WL: The use of "vs." here is weird? 
these are clearly members of one another. 
11. Do we intend guidelines to be used by regulators and requirements-setters (e.g., in companies)? 
WL: Whatever the "intent" might be, this will happen - can't be stopped. 
We may not choose to encourage such use but intent probably is of little import. 
Awareness of this probability may or may not figure into the deliberations about the document's language.

EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY 
Greg, and what a wonderful parade of elephants i'tis .... 
These two bear similarities, so may be combined ... see comment on #8 ... 
This is a biggie .... the best presentation of the guidelines is still William's version ... which shows everything important on a single screenful! 
We can't ask our audience to accommodate folks they can't empathize with, if we can't do the same ... 
If we include normative, there may be a tendency to consider these the "core" of the guidelines, with the informative checkpoints as "priority 3" irrespective of the group size and practical applications .... Perhaps not ... 
We can have a "one version for all", but that single version accessibly-maximized page could reach a whole lot of people ... but there are some disabled folks whose needs can only be served by a single modality presentation ... perhaps achievable in some multi-choice browser of the future! 
I think this mean "set by the browser" vs "set by the web author" ... you 
can set in the browser unless the web author provides it on the server side 
.... am I missing the meaning of this elephant? 
This is a tail of the 2/3 Elephant .... 
Don't .... If we don't explain how to make the web accessible to absolutely all (not necessarily in a single version of course) who will? 
This corresponds with #9 ... 
Yes, and department appointees in various departments in government, and schools ... Our guidelines need to lead the follow through to authoring stuff such that a teacher can use a version x.x of Front Page and make a class page her Kindergartners can share with the same without needing to consult a bunch of technical guidelines so that the kids at her partner school for the blind and deaf can participate with the regular students .... Ah, perhaps I wax too educational ... grin Until Front Page is usable for accessibility without knowledge by the author, the guidelines need to reach down to the least technical of the potential audience (folks who make web sites that may come under federal or other national regulations) .... 
I'm never sure if usability is the large group and accessibility is subsumed ... or if accessibility is the extremes of usability .... 
Testing tends to skew the importance of some checkpoints/guidelines. 
To the extent that testing a site helps an author find out which graphics they forgot to alt text as they edit the page, it's useful ... used as a distinction between priority levels, it could skew conformance away from the goal of accessibility for all ... 
This basically boils down to user needs for authors to provide "more" content than they originally planned ... whether it's adding text to audio, or graphics, or adding the illustrations not originally imagined ... 
Not sure what this means ... 
When we define "equivalent", we see how important it is to make it clear that all modalities need an equivalent, including text content .... Anne Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com 
Accepted as a friendly amendment.
