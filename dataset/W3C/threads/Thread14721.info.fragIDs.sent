<s> What about handling valid code?  </s>
<s> What kind of systems do people have to use this software on?  </s>
<s> I think it's not enough to simply "ignore" or "not break" on abbr and acronym and dfn and tt -- there should be some manner in which this information is conveyed to the user.  </s>

<s> * HTML equivalents for XHTML Basic * CSS level 1 * ECMAscript (plus W3C DOM?)  </s>
<s> In my opinion that constitutes a reasonable baseline of support for 2001 web browsers.  </s>
<s> Anything less than that is lagging behind spec by a great deal, and represents software in serious need of upgrade.  </s>

<s> This has been a productive discussion.  </s>
<s> There is a higher-level issue which hasn't been touched on, however, namely the extent to which the guidelines should allow developers to decide what level of support to expect from user agents visiting the site.  </s>
<s> Should it make a difference, so far as conformance to the guidelines is concerned, if a developer decides to rely on a particular technology that may not be widely available to users, but for which relevant techniques are available, or to expect a level of support that goes beyond the "minimal capabilities", whatever they may  </s>
<s> be?  </s>
<s> This brings us back to Kynn's "policy framework" proposals, which  </s>
<s> among other factors permit developers to choose, within limits, which technologies to require of the user agent, and at what level.  </s>
<s> Also, if we were to define a minimal user agent profile, how would we use it?  </s>
<s> There are several possibilities: 1.  </s>
<s> In the techniques, we could omit strategies and work-arounds that are applicable only to user agents which don't meet the minimal requirement, or at least label them as deprecated.  </s>
<s> 2. We could maintain, separately from the guidelines, a page (which would have to be updated) giving informative advice regarding what user agent capabilities it would be reasonable for developers to expect if they wish to aim for a broad audience.  </s>
<s> 3. In the conformance scheme we could require that conforming content be readable via a user agent that has the specified minimum capabilities.  </s>
<s> 4. In the conformance scheme, we could allow developers to choose their own desired type and level of user agent support, but allow them to assert (in the conformance claim) what user agent capabilities their content requires.  </s>
<s> A fortiori, they would be permitted to assert that their content was readable by a user agent having the minimal capabilities that we define.  </s>
<s> Note: options 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive.  </s>
<s> The above list is not exhaustive.  </s>
<s> CSS2 conflicts with CSS1, at some points.  </s>
<s> Plus, CSS1 (and CSS2) is rather bloated.  </s>
<s> I guess CSS3: VisualBoxModel + Aureal rendering is a real minimum for CSS support (cascading and selectors should be included, too, but these are supporting modules).  </s>
<s> I also think that CSS3: Line Text layout module should be optional, it's really not necessary to support "Line Text layouting" in text-based browser, like Lynx (you can emulate DIV and SPAN elements, borders, padding even in text mode, but I doubt that you can use different typeface, etc.).  </s>
<s> Therefor, I think that dependency list for Visual BoxModel should be changed in final CSS3 Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Tables, Positioning, Fonts, etc. should be optional in Minimal Browser Capabilities.  </s>
<s> Now we just need to get Netscape and Microsoft supporting this minimum ASAP  </s>

<s> Without a DOM, ECMAScript would be pointless, indeed it would be impossible to distinguish between a browser which did or did not support ECMAScript, so the real issue is DOM support, not ECMAScript support.  </s>
<s> There is no standardised basic DOM, it's all pretty much by agreement to the early Netscapes "DOM level 0", perhaps you could say that was a minimum requirement, DOM Level 1, and DOM level 2, can't be, they include things which make little sense in many output mediums, and would cause programmers severe difficulties.  </s>
<s> Then there's the simple fact that page authors can't currently even author scripts that work today, let alone work and are accessible.  </s>
<s> You've not explained which parts of DOM you feel are necessary - without DOM2 (well in reality the IE extensions - style object and innerHTML.) then ECMAScript/DOM does very little, either positive client-side validation (only positive from a speed/reactivity basis) and the negative of "browser sniffing".  </s>
