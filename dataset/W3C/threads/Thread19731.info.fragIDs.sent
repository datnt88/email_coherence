You are right. 
Thanks. 
Hi I noticed that in the directory thot\win95\bin there are a couple of files that you don't need to send out Amaya.exp Amaya.ilk Amaya.lib Amaya.pdb 
They're all MSVC build files. 
I'm sure removing them will make the 2.8 Meg of the distribution file a fair bit smaller ;-)

I noticed that in the directory thot\win95\bin there are a couple of files that you don't need to send out 
...and perhaps you should include the Amaya.exe file, too!
