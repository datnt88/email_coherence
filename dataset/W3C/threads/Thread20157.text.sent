On a sun U5 with solaris 2.6, I compiled (with many efforts !). When I laumch amaya, every thing seems well. 
But in editor mode the keyboard is ineffective. 
Especially in dialog box. 
I tried to use the libraries I got with the binary distribution but got the same effect. 
Any ideas ?

(anonyme) If you have the NumLock on the keyboard doesn't work. 
That's about my only idea.

Yes. 
This is an error in the libXm.so 
delivered with solaris 2.6. 
To solve that problem I suggest you to try the included version of libXm delivered with the binary 2.6 instead of the standard one. 
To do that, you have to download somewhere the amaya-solaris2.6-2.1.tar.gz (see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html) and change the path in the file Options: MOTIF_LIBRARIES= Irene.
