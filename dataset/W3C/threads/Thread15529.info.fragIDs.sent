In discussions on our last call "usability" came up since it was a question from one of our reviewers How do we separate "Accessibility / Usability problems that are specific to disabilities" From "usability issues that are faced by all users" 
One test I have sometimes found useful in examining this question is "Does it multiply the time and effort for people with disabilities by the same amount as people without disabilities?" 
If the multiplier is the same - then it may be a general usability issue. 
For example Good page 2 min for no disability Good page 4 min for screen reader user Bad page 3 min for no disability Bad page 6 min for screen reader user 
This bad page appears to be 50% harder for both groups. 
This looks more 
like a general usability problem rather than accessibility since it slows everyone down by the same factor Another example Good page 2 min for no disability Good page 4 min with screen reader Page 2 - 3 min for no disability Page 2 - 10 min with screen reader. 
Page 3 - 3 min for no disability Page 3 - cannot get at some of the information with screen reader. 
These look like accessibility problems Page 2 is much more than proportionately harder (250% vs 50%) Page 3 is inaccessible Just passing along in case it is of use to others in thinking about the problem Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Depts of Ind.

Time cannot be used as a reliable indicator of usability. 
Firstly you will not get "times" that are nicely differentiated like 2mins vs 4mins It will be more like 2.1 mins vs 2.25 mins. 
Then there's the issues of when the task started, the level of verbosity of the participant and level of success related to the completion of the task. 
Finally, satisfaction plays a big part too. 
Just because a task takes a few extra seconds may not mean that participants are any less satisfied with the effectiveness [their success] or efficiency [their effort] of the interface. 
In fact those few extra seconds may indeed add to satisfaction in some cases and leave the participant feeling that the interface is more usable. 
So to answer your question you cannot differentiate [nor should you] accessibility and usability issues a priori. 
The only way to know if issues are particular to the disabled is to test with those intended users. 
That involves running a formal usability test. 
Accessibility has a lot to do with the coding we use for web pages etc and that sadly is where it has always lost traction with the wider commercial world. 
Until we make testing with real users the central theme then accessibility will continue to reside in an esoteric, "not my problem" backwater as far as most corporations are concerned. 
Thanks, Gordon.

Hello Gregg. 
I think this is a tricky question. 
Usability cannot be referred to "all users", cause it depends on user knowledge, motivation, environment, goals, and so on. 
Usability is not a general property of the site, but rather a property of the relationship (the interaction...) between a product (a site) and a specific user in a specific situation. 
This doesn't mean that we can't extimate general usability problems. 
We can in fact set up common scenarios for our site, and try to solve any problem that can cause trouble in that scenarios. 
There are also some common cognitive capabilities (perception, unique attention focus), and that capabilities should be takent into account. 
But there are also some goal-related specific problem (and disability-related, of course). 
There are some domain-konowledge related problem. 
There are expertise-related issues, and so on. 
Furthermore, to take the time as a reliable indicator of performance, we should have significant data, that in most usability test (with 3-8 user) we can't have. 
A task completing-time can vary a lot in non-disabled user. 
So it would be very rare (and expensive) to have good means and standard deviation 
in homogeneus testing groups, that need 15 and more user, and particular 
testing conditions. 
Maybe we can try to set up some simple, standard scenarios, a common task-set (searching info, reading article, fillin up forms with personal data, browsing in categories, etc), and then build up a matrix in which we can compare different type of diabilities in common scenarios/task. 
I don't know if I am clear: I will try to do an example, if you like. 
Best things, Maurizio Boscarol 
Sorry I don't know where the implication that the times needed to be in round numbers or that the numbers weren't derived from user testing came from - but that was not my intention. 
I was talking about results from user testing. 
Also - this was not meant to be a 'final determination' but rather a sniff test. 
If something slows people with disabilities down the same proportionate amount as people without disabilities - then I look at it more carefully to see if it is indeed just a usability problem rather than an accessibility problem. 
Here I am defining accessibility problems as problems that result from a person having a disability and that affect them in ways or in proportions that are not experienced by everyone else (without that disability). 
Again - please note that this is NOT something that I am proposing as a definition or for use by our group. 
It was simply something I found useful when looking at problems in this area - and I posted to the list because others found it an interesting idea to roll around in their heads.

Hi Maurizio Agree - but interestingly enough - both usability and accessibility are individual based. 
Thus whether you talk about an aggregate or individual - the same concepts would apply. 
Unfortunately - we can't design for individuals but for groups. 
The closest we can come perhaps - and this is nice where we can do it -- is to have content whose presentation is tailored to the user. 
Even this though has raised some concerns. 
I would be interested in your examples.

Best things, Maurizio Boscarol 
Yes. All I wanted was to point out that this is true both in accessibility and in usability. 
So, to say "usability issues that are faced by all users" is a little... uhm... odd. 
It's not what it is or what it should be. 
I agree that we need grouping. 
Even set up a scenario is a way of grouping, in a sense. 
Even to talk of general accessibility, after all, is not really correct, because blind users have different problems from color-blind user. 
So the problems is in talking in general. 
Grouping is needed as a satisfying method that can drive the design and the evaluation. 
Another point is that time measures need good sampling and statistical 
constraints, of course, so, if we have small groups, timing is not 
really a good way to distinguish group differences. 
So, if we have small group, we need another way to compare problems and UI. 
Perhaps we need some GOMS-like method (1) translation to different category of users. 
Goms can be used to compare the efficiency of GUI in certain tasks. 
It refer to not-disable individual. 
We could use some similar method to compare the efficiency of the same interface between different groups of users. 
In that way we can compare the before-after interfaces for different targets of user. 
It's just an idea. 
Needs research contribution, I guess. 
Ok, I'll take the time to make a simple table to express myself in a screen-readable mode.. ;-)

Ah I see what you tripped on. 
Interesting. 
I agree on the individual bit. 
And it goes even farther than people who are blind having different problems from people who are deaf. 
Even people who are blind are individuals and one cannot generalize from one to the next. 
I'll have to word that better next time.

Here I am... ... This is what I meant talking with Gregg about the matrix including different tasks for different groups of users. 
I don't think it's nothing new, but perhaps it can be useful to remember that in usability we can have general evaluation in which more task-specific and user-specific consideration should be made. 
Even comparing the usability problems in the same task for different user in two version of design can be useful. 
The user configuration can be split: the same type of user can have a 640 x 480 monitor, as well as 1024 x 768... for certain tasks and sites this can make a lot of difference (I have a webmail where the logout is *impossible* to see and to click in 640 monitor, even with scrolling...). 
The problem remain in numerals. 
Numbers can be used to extimate difference in performance between groups? 
Yes, but should be done with experimental constraints. 
Not so easy to do, very expensive and time-consuming. 
Extimating time on the basis of 3-8 user per group can lead to big mistakes in evaluation. 
So I propose analytical method, also with numbers, but not based on user measured performance (like the task analysis). 
As an example, I compared two version of alistapart page design, using some measures to extimate how ease to read an article was. 
(only in italian, sorry: http://www.usabile.it/242003.htm; on the same topic, but on a different problem: before-after comparison can always be done in similar way, even if what is to measure can be difficult sometimes to agree. 
Don't know if this can help, anyway. 
Let me know, if you want. 
Best, Maurizio Boscarol 
Interesting exercise Probably should add a column for interactive content such as educational materials often are (and games). 
Boy this really highlights how complicated this can be. 
This is very good but you can also see where this could be easily expanded with other disabilities and activities.
