<s> Hello Gregg.  </s>
<s> I think this is a tricky question.  </s>
<s> Usability cannot be referred to "all users", cause it depends on user knowledge, motivation, environment, goals, and so on.  </s>
<s> Usability is not a general property of the site, but rather a property of the relationship (the interaction...) between a product (a site) and a specific user in a specific situation.  </s>
<s> This doesn't mean that we can't extimate general usability problems.  </s>
<s> We can in fact set up common scenarios for our site, and try to solve any problem that can cause trouble in that scenarios.  </s>
<s> There are also some common cognitive capabilities (perception, unique attention focus), and that capabilities should be takent into account.  </s>
<s> But there are also some goal-related specific problem (and disability-related, of course).  </s>
<s> There are some domain-konowledge related problem.  </s>
<s> There are expertise-related issues, and so on.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, to take the time as a reliable indicator of performance, we should have significant data, that in most usability test (with 3-8 user) we can't have.  </s>
<s> A task completing-time can vary a lot in non-disabled user.  </s>
<s> So it would be very rare (and expensive) to have good means and standard deviation  </s>
<s> in homogeneus testing groups, that need 15 and more user, and particular  </s>
<s> testing conditions.  </s>
<s> Maybe we can try to set up some simple, standard scenarios, a common task-set (searching info, reading article, fillin up forms with personal data, browsing in categories, etc), and then build up a matrix in which we can compare different type of diabilities in common scenarios/task.  </s>
<s> I don't know if I am clear: I will try to do an example, if you like.  </s>
<s> Best things, Maurizio Boscarol  </s>
<s> Sorry I don't know where the implication that the times needed to be in round numbers or that the numbers weren't derived from user testing came from - but that was not my intention.  </s>
<s> I was talking about results from user testing.  </s>
<s> Also - this was not meant to be a 'final determination' but rather a sniff test.  </s>
<s> If something slows people with disabilities down the same proportionate amount as people without disabilities - then I look at it more carefully to see if it is indeed just a usability problem rather than an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> Here I am defining accessibility problems as problems that result from a person having a disability and that affect them in ways or in proportions that are not experienced by everyone else (without that disability).  </s>
<s> Again - please note that this is NOT something that I am proposing as a definition or for use by our group.  </s>
<s> It was simply something I found useful when looking at problems in this area - and I posted to the list because others found it an interesting idea to roll around in their heads.  </s>

<s> Hi Maurizio Agree - but interestingly enough - both usability and accessibility are individual based.  </s>
<s> Thus whether you talk about an aggregate or individual - the same concepts would apply.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately - we can't design for individuals but for groups.  </s>
<s> The closest we can come perhaps - and this is nice where we can do it -- is to have content whose presentation is tailored to the user.  </s>
