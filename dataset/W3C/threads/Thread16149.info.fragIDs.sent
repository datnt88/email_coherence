<s> I am trying to clarify checkpoint 4.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines which suggests using the title attribute to specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it "first occurs."  </s>
<s> Is titling only the first occurrence adequate?  </s>
<s> What if a user skips past the first occurrence of an abbreviation?  </s>

<s> Actually, given the way speech synthesizers work, even the expansion might sometimes be difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> As long as the acronym is not spread out with spaces (i.e., appears as a "word" to the screen reader) the screen reader's dictionary function can make any substitution the user wants.  </s>
<s> Here's an idea for the screen reader manufacturers: Have a hot-key feature that grabs the acronym being pointed to, inserts it into the dictionary, then lets the user highlight the expansion text and insert and edit it as the substitute text for the acronym.  </s>
<s> This would be a quick and easy way to handle acronyms that follow the print convention and take advantage of the screen reader's dictionary capability (assuming it has one).  </s>
<s> It also leaves the decision about what is to be presented verbally in the hands of the user who probably knows better what they want in this case than the web author.  </s>
<s> Also, it can avoid repetition of wordy expansions which can be as tedious to listen to as they would be to read visually.  </s>

<s> Thank you for the explanation of the thinking behind the ABBR expansion checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Given the decision to go with the "minimum" accommodation, maybe it would make sense to recommend that user agents cache the title expansions of ABBR &amp; ACRONYM elements?  </s>
