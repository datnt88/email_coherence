I am trying to clarify checkpoint 4.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines which suggests using the title attribute to specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it "first occurs." 
Is titling only the first occurrence adequate? 
What if a user skips past the first occurrence of an abbreviation? 
Thank you.

In making that recommendation, we were following the standard print convention of only expanding the first occurrence of an unfamiliar abbreviation or acronym in a document. 
There was significant discussion on the topic, with some members of the working group feeling strongly that all occurrences should be marked up. 
Others felt that this was too great a burden on page authors, especially when the print convention was so universally accepted. 
Anyway, a consensus was reached with the "minimum" requirement being to only mark up the first occurrence. 
Of course, any author is free to code all occurrences if they so choose. 
One possibility is to tie this checkpoint to the Authoring Tool working 
group (if it is not already being considered). 
Perhaps an authoring tool 
could be given the "smarts" to prompt for the first expansion of an acronym or abbreviation, then, optionally reuse the markup whenever the same string is detected.

Cross-posted to authoring tool group and interest group. 
Although the authoring tool accessibility guidelines draft covers the issue of structural information (such as ABBR and ACRONYM exansions) in checkpoint 2.4.2 
I will use this example as one of the techniques. 
A useful addition to the techniques would be a list of the relevant elements in HTML, SMIL, SVG, the relevant features in GIF and PNG, etc Charles McCN In making that recommendation, we were following the standard print convention of only expanding the first occurrence of an unfamiliar abbreviation or acronym in a document.

Actually, given the way speech synthesizers work, even the expansion might sometimes be difficult to understand. 
As long as the acronym is not spread out with spaces (i.e., appears as a "word" to the screen reader) the screen reader's dictionary function can make any substitution the user wants. 
Here's an idea for the screen reader manufacturers: Have a hot-key feature that grabs the acronym being pointed to, inserts it into the dictionary, then lets the user highlight the expansion text and insert and edit it as the substitute text for the acronym. 
This would be a quick and easy way to handle acronyms that follow the print convention and take advantage of the screen reader's dictionary capability (assuming it has one). 
It also leaves the decision about what is to be presented verbally in the hands of the user who probably knows better what they want in this case than the web author. 
Also, it can avoid repetition of wordy expansions which can be as tedious to listen to as they would be to read visually.

Thank you for the explanation of the thinking behind the ABBR expansion checkpoint. 
Given the decision to go with the "minimum" accommodation, maybe it would make sense to recommend that user agents cache the title expansions of ABBR &amp; ACRONYM elements? 
Thanks again.

I forwarded the suggestion to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines working group.
