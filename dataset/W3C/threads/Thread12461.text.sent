I propose that we remove this checkpoint under Guideline: Integrate accessibility solutions into the overall "look and feel": Ensure that the functionalities for checkpoints 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 are always clearly available to the user [Priority 1] I think the intent of the checkpoint is well covered by another checkpoint that we already have (we can change its Priority if necessary): Ensure that all functionality (prompts, checkers, information icons, etc.) related to accessible authoring practices is naturally integrated into the overall look and feel of the tool.

Hi folks, I am against the proposed change. 
I think that the more limited set of features being always available (not just integrated somehow) at a higher priority level is something that we should keep. 
Having the accessibility checking in front of the user is a good thing for helping users to remember to use it, and not give up because they had to look in a menu or four to find it.

Instead, I was looking at Checkpoint 5.3. 
It requires a rough UI equivalence between functions of a tool that do the same kinds of things (Note: The minimums for 5.2 and 5.3 are switched in the last Wombat draft). 
Therefore, it prevents a tool from having a spell checker that is 1-step away for the user, while the accessibility checker is 4-steps away. 
Unfortunately, this will break down if the other tool has done a bad job of making its other checkers available or it does not have any other checkers. 
So perhaps I can suggest a re-wording of 5.1, that brings it more in line with 5.3 (I think this will make it more clear that 5.3 applies to how the functionality is made "available" to satisfy 5.1). 
- ATAG Checkpoint 5.X: Ensure that functionality (prompts, checkers, information icons, etc.) related to ATAG checkpoints 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 are always clearly available to the user Note 1: What about adding 4.2? 
Note 2: I'm wondering how well 3.2 fits in here. 
It is a much less constrained than the others - but since it is probably the area of the techniques most in need of work, maybe that will change.
