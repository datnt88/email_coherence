<s> Last week was very busy.  </s>
<s> I was remiss in sending out an update of exciting developments.  </s>
<s> WWW2004 Panel +1 We have the go ahead from local hosts to do a panel on W3photo Tuesday or Wednesday of WWW2004.  </s>
<s> We can also do a booth...if we can organize people/ourselves to have people at the booth.  </s>
<s> Privacy/Annotation Issues +1 Great IRC discussion led to thinking of contributed photos like blog posts: contributor can annotate, others can comment on annotations/regions.  </s>
<s> This simplifies certain policy issues.  </s>
<s> Of course, this is the semantic web, so others can create annotations on their own sites that point to photos.  </s>
<s> WWW2004 is a starting point +1 AKTive Space is going to focus first on organizing conference material for www2004 and then go back to past years.  </s>
<s> It probably makes the most sense if we present w3photo at www2004 as the beginning of something rather than a finished presentation.  </s>
<s> Collaborative Workshop?  </s>
<s> Mike and I discussed if the w3photo booth should be more like a collaborative workshop...an ongoing opportunity for people to see and to explore the building of this archive.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>

<s> Sorry I've been so out of the loop - here's some quick responses  </s>
<s> panel is good, also like the booth idea - but see below  </s>
<s> makes sense  </s>
<s> I would be upset if anyone ever considered this something different - I only bought in to the current design (slightly Sem Webbie) because I assumed we'd be doing more in the future  </s>
<s> Why not run as a "kiosk" where people can bring photos, mark them up, add markup, etc -- if we could get a couple of machines and people would bring by USB disks w/photos on them, we could build the archive dynamically and in real time...

<s> sounds just great.  </s>
<s> I'd really like to be there but I'm still not sure if I can afford it.  </s>
<s> _If_ I'm going I could bring along a notebook and support us/the booth team.  </s>
<s> (hmm, there is this "interaction design and SW" workshop on tuesday, that I'd like to attend then, too...;)  </s>
<s> are there already ideas how to realize that technically?  </s>
<s> (extra terms for annotation comments / reification / distinction on application level / ... ?)  </s>
<s> makes a lot of sense to me, as we will probably have various different annotation tools (hey libby, I like those "tab"-extensions!) that are still under development.  </s>
<s> and I guess we'll still be at an experimental stage in may (only 7 weeks to go)  </s>
<s> yeah, I'd like that.  </s>
<s> and also Jim Hendler's "kiosk" idea.  </s>
<s> would be perfect to get instant feedback (on tools, privacy issues, ...), and IMO also very good for SemWeb word spreading/deployment (if we get our tools working by then) as people could experience some of the RDF benefits, e.g. "this tool's cool for mass annotating, this one to identify people, this one for browsing.",  </s>
<s> "No, you don't need to make a local copy", "yes, you could add another annotation property on 'runtime'" ... great news, Greg.  </s>
<s> reeespect!  </s>
