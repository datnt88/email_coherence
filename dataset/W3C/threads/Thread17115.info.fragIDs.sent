Of course, designers like hiding basic controls, particularly links, in creative design. 
That's really very amusing. 
Can you give us five examples of pages-- even single pages-- where the stylesheet declarations for the a 
element make it absolutely indistinguishable from surrounding text or content?

Joe, I'll submit http://www.peepo.com as one-five page(s) or a site. 
To my view this is something for the user to control. 
Given the possible development of sites with enhanced semantic and meta content, this is likely to require even greater user specification, if it is to function.

Anyone have any ideas about whether the various formats of EYEBLASTER ads are accessible or if they disrupt assistive technology? 
Sincerely, Mike Burks 
had no trouble accessing the site but it told me that I had to be using Windows and IE 5.0 or higher to enter. 
I would consider it inaccessible due to it's browser specific nature Bob

That's not what I was saying. 
What I'm saying is that they like changing the design so that if one tells one's elderly relative to look for blue underlined text, they will completely miss the links. 
It would take me a while to find the article, but I once picked a page 
on a relatively conventional e-commerce site that was most of the way to having five different paradigms for links on one page. 
Finding pages that don't try to restyle links is more difficult than finding ones that do. 
Regular web users completely underestimate the amount of knowledge about design conventions that is needed to work out how to use a web page without waving the mouse around looking for links to appear on the status line. 
In the case of an neophyte elderly user, if you are to get them started, the instructions for using the web need to fit on a single handwritten page. 
That would be possible if people didn't try to be creative, but isn't in the real world. 
One's elderly relative will have to get used to the unchangeable reality that there are many ways to specify a hyperlink. 
The logical extension of the complaint above is that the a element should not be stylable under CSS, and that states like :hover, :visited, :active, and their combinations should be deleted from the spec. 
Because there are good reasons to do it. 
* Top and left-hand navigation is full almost to the brim with links. 
We know they're links. 
We don't need them blue and underlined. 
* Logos, photos, and other images do not need blue borders to distinguish themselves as links. 
* Body copy *can* use text-decoration: underline or similar "classic" link decoration. 
Cf. http://www.contenu.nu/article.htm?id=1217 . 
I would note that the aforesaid :hover, :visited, and :active styles are useful in graphical browsers, and often very nice. 
Screen-reader users, for example, can often select by link, move by link, or extract links. 
Even unadorned browsers often permit tabbing from link to link, so mobility-impaired people with no adaptive technology never are at a loss for what is and is not a link. 
(Indeed, skipping links becomes the issue.) 
That's exactly how people have to do it-- *at first*. 
(And, on occasional sites, everyone does it even many years after they get online.) Novice users don't stay that way forever, and we shouldn't upset defensible design conventions merely because a new medium is confusing the first few times you use it. 
Of course it's gonna be.

They won't, because they will abandon the attempt before they get that far.
