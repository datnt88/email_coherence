<s> Joe, I'll submit http://www.peepo.com as one-five page(s) or a site.  </s>
<s> To my view this is something for the user to control.  </s>
<s> Given the possible development of sites with enhanced semantic and meta content, this is likely to require even greater user specification, if it is to function.  </s>

<s> It would take me a while to find the article, but I once picked a page  </s>
<s> on a relatively conventional e-commerce site that was most of the way to having five different paradigms for links on one page.  </s>
<s> Finding pages that don't try to restyle links is more difficult than finding ones that do.  </s>
<s> Regular web users completely underestimate the amount of knowledge about design conventions that is needed to work out how to use a web page without waving the mouse around looking for links to appear on the status line.  </s>
<s> In the case of an neophyte elderly user, if you are to get them started, the instructions for using the web need to fit on a single handwritten page.  </s>
<s> That would be possible if people didn't try to be creative, but isn't in the real world.  </s>
<s> One's elderly relative will have to get used to the unchangeable reality that there are many ways to specify a hyperlink.  </s>
<s> The logical extension of the complaint above is that the a element should not be stylable under CSS, and that states like :hover, :visited, :active, and their combinations should be deleted from the spec.  </s>
<s> Because there are good reasons to do it.  </s>
<s> * Top and left-hand navigation is full almost to the brim with links.  </s>
<s> We know they're links.  </s>
<s> We don't need them blue and underlined.  </s>
<s> * Logos, photos, and other images do not need blue borders to distinguish themselves as links.  </s>
<s> * Body copy *can* use text-decoration: underline or similar "classic" link decoration.  </s>
<s> Cf. http://www.contenu.nu/article.htm?id=1217 .  </s>
<s> I would note that the aforesaid :hover, :visited, and :active styles are useful in graphical browsers, and often very nice.  </s>
<s> Screen-reader users, for example, can often select by link, move by link, or extract links.  </s>
<s> Even unadorned browsers often permit tabbing from link to link, so mobility-impaired people with no adaptive technology never are at a loss for what is and is not a link.  </s>
<s> (Indeed, skipping links becomes the issue.)  </s>
<s> That's exactly how people have to do it-- *at first*.  </s>
<s> (And, on occasional sites, everyone does it even many years after they get online.) Novice users don't stay that way forever, and we shouldn't upset defensible design conventions merely because a new medium is confusing the first few times you use it.  </s>
<s> Of course it's gonna be.  </s>
