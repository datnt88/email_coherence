I'm testing amaya 5.0 with windows 98. consider the file: 
if I put the cursor between the two words "one" and "two", and I press "shift enter", the program exits without warning. 
your opinion ?

You are right, it is a bug. 
I have fixed it in the CVS version. 
Thanks for your report.

I always find it incredible that such things are even discovered! 
I'm sure there's some very good reason for hitting "shift enter" at that point, but it somehow seemed like a strange thing to have learned. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
[DJW:] Whilst Amaya shouldn't crash in the way that you describe, this HTML is badly broken. 
DIR is deprecated, but even when used, its content model: [DJW:] does not allow text immediately after the start tag - only LI elements are allowed - and doesn't allow P anywhere within the content - all block level elements are forbidden. 
I'll assume the lack of the mandatory TITLE element was the result of simplifying for this article. 
Note the start tag on LI elements in required.

[DJW:] PS I think the effect you are trying to achieve can only correctly be achieved using a CSS attribute of "list-style:none" on the list items (works for IE 5.01, NS 4.75 and Mozilla 0.9.2; fails for Amaya 4.2.1; Amaya 5 doesn't even display the home page, but I haven't time to diagnose now).
