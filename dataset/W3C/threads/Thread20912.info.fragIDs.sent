14. I've seen this bug before it seems, Amaya loses the space between a closing element and the followingcharacter: becomes 
Joseph, 
Yes, Amaya ignores the spaces you mention, but I think it is right in doing so. 
Quoting the HTML 4.01 specification: 
In order to avoid problems with SGML line break rules and inconsistencies among extant implementations, authors should not rely on user agents to render white space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an end tag. 
Thus, authors, and in particular authoring tools, should write: and not: Refer to the end of section 9.1: Vincent. 
Well, that just displaces the problem, as Amaya is the authoring tool that creates the text. 
In particular, it creates this HTML that it then ignores, when the a elements is within the strong element. 
If I have this text, which works fine: li E38.2160 a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/courses_values_2003.html" 
Values Embodied in Info/Comm Technologies /a LEC 3.0 Nissenbaum and I select this takes and make it bold, it turns it into: li strong E38.2160 /strong a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/courses_values_2003.html" strong Values Embodied in Info/Comm Technologies /strong /a strong LEC 3.0 Nissenbaum /strong and the spaces in the above text are no longer rendered by Amaya -- though they are by other browsers.
