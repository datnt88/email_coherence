<s> What is accessibility?  </s>
<s> ;) Google's definition is ok[1], but I have yet to find such a good one on W3. Especially regarding its boundaries.  </s>
<s> Is there a difference with Universal accessibility (all the rage in the academic world)?  </s>
<s> I have been asking questions [2] [3] over at w3-di about how accessibility and device independence relate.  </s>
<s> One of the themes of accessibility is making document device independent[4].  </s>
<s> I've seen texts put it like the mobile device is a  </s>
<s> disabled view of the web.  </s>
<s> Which is a little sad.  </s>
<s> *So is device independence a subset of accessibility?*  </s>
<s> What about usability?  </s>
<s> What about i18n issues?  </s>
<s> "Access to a Unified Web from Any Device in Any Context by Anyone" [6] Might mean accessibility is part of Device Independence.  </s>
<s> See the confusion?  </s>
<s> I drew up a little diagram [5] today at the suggestion of w3-di participant, but are there must be better ones out there?  </s>
<s> :)  </s>

<s> I've used this example myself, but mainly to sell accessibility to clients, to make them understand that the concept of accessibility is not just about "the blind guy in the corner".  </s>
<s> It's a very imperfect simplification, admittedly, of a concept which deserves to be discussed in its own right, of course.  </s>
<s> Possibly...on the other hand, one could also say that device independence has a positive, collateral effect on accessibility.  </s>
<s> I have to admit, I haven't thought about the "bigger picture" like this before...but just coming at this fresh: personally, I think that - as good as the diagram is, there are a few areas which should really overlap.  </s>
<s> Unicode and Interoperability Standards, for instance.  </s>
<s> Not sure what "special needs" would be exactly, so that may need a bit of clarification.  </s>
<s> And usability, rather than just being a segregated little section, would probably encompass (or at least intersect with) a few of the other areas.  </s>
<s> Anyway, sorry for not really coming up with any substantial (or substantiated, as the case may be) answers...just thinking out loud.  </s>
<s> Food for thought, nonetheless.  </s>
<s> Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford  </s>
<s> right I have yet to see a deffinition of accessibility (especially concerns the web) that I feel comfortable enough to hang my hat on.  </s>
<s> text is so much more than folks who are visually impaired, and simplified graphics is so much more than developmental disabilities.  </s>
<s> example that I rarely hear used, people with ADHD (and it's variants) are sometimes very distracted by graphics and popups and all the stuff on a page that they can only effectively use the web in text mode.  </s>
<s> and there are so many of these variants that finding something that works for even the majority of people is pretty hard but we do need to at least address the issues, and define the problem if at all possible.  </s>

<s> The diagram seems to be lacking a lot (apart from a textual equivalent ;-)).  </s>
<s> I think there need to be more immediate subsets of universal accessibility.  </s>
<s> (OK, I'm not sure what at the moment but intuitively it looks and feels too disjointed and sparse.)  </s>
<s> What you need is some sort of web application where people can modify the diagram and others can discuss.  </s>
<s> Maybe like some sort of svg wiki?  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> SVG format: Dia format: My browser can't view SVG, and besides I have not seen a SVG wiki.  </s>
<s> So the best I can suggest is for you all to grab what I have and play around with it and stick it back up on the web somewhere (or just mail it to me).  </s>
<s> Kind regards,  </s>
<s> I believe universal web accessibility should be defined as: Universal Web Accessibility is where the user, be it a human or a computer program, can send commands, send information, and retrieve information regardless of the mode of input or output of the accessing device.  </s>
<s> I believe it boils down to allowing universal access via unlimited, yet defined, modes of access.  </s>
<s> I believe things such as bandwith, cost, il8n, etc are parameters of input/output.  </s>
