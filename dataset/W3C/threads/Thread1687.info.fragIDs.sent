<s> Hi, There's someyhing about I've have questions : when a user calls the VERSION-CONTROL method on a versionable resource, it performs 3 operations : - creation of a new version history, - conversion of the versionable resource in version controlled resource, - creation of a new version by copy of the versionable resource (content and properties).  </s>
<s> My question is : why doing a copy of the version controlled resource ?  </s>
<s> why duplicating it ?  </s>
<s> It is not enough, just keeping it, and creating the first version after checking it out, modifying it, and checking it in ?  </s>
<s> Thanx in advance for answering at this (simple) question !  </s>
<s> A version is created as a copy because the version-controlled resource can  </s>
<s> be checked out and modified.  </s>
<s> The version remains as an immutable copy of  </s>
<s> the inital state of the VERSION-CONTROL'led resource.  </s>
<s> Clearly, _implementations_ don't have to do a copy and can fake out the two resources (version and checked-in version-controlled resource) using the same underlying storage.  </s>

<s> I made a mistake.  </s>
<s> A version-controlled resource is a resource with defined DeltaV behavior, notably CHECKOUT to make it mutable and CHECKIN to capture it's state as a version resource and make it immutable.  </s>
<s> RFC3253 has lots to say about version-controlled resources.  </s>
<s> But why is it possible to modify it, if I can create descendants with the first version of the history ?  </s>
<s> You can either modify the checked-out version-controlled resource, or a working resource of a version to create a descendant depending upon whether the server or client is maintaining the 'workspace' or work in progress.  </s>
<s> See section 2.1 for an overview of the differences.  </s>
