<s> Looks like another last call doc or review from the XMLP folks.  </s>
<s> Any volunteers to review on behalf of the WG? Brian  </s>
<s> The XML Protocol WG is planning to submit one document, "SOAP 1.2 Attachment Feature", for Last Call review.  </s>
<s> The abstract reads: This document defines a SOAP feature that represents an abstract model for SOAP attachments.  </s>
<s> It provides the basis for the creation of SOAP bindings that transmit such attachments along with a SOAP envelope, and provides for reference of those attachments from the envelope.  </s>
<s> SOAP attachments are described using the notion of a compound document structure consisting of a primary SOAP message part and zero or more related documents parts known as attachments.  </s>
<s> The document is short, about 8 pages including references and boilerplate, and does not specify any particular implementation for attachments.  </s>
<s> The LC document will be a very slightly modified version of the current WD [1].  </s>
<s> We would especially like reviews from the following WGs: I18N, QA, Semantic Web (WG's therein), Web Services Architecture, Web Services Description, XForms, XML Core, XML Encryption, and XML Signature.  </s>
<s> My question to those WGs (and to any other interested WGs) is whether you would be _unable_ to provide a review if the LC period started around Sept 23 and ended around Oct 14.  </s>

<s> Brian, I'm not sure what we'd say about this.  </s>
<s> I looked at the working draft a while back and while it seemed OK as far as it goes, I didn't notice any special relevance to RDF.  </s>
<s> Here are the comments I made to a different (non-W3C) forum.  </s>
<s> In the medium/long term, I think it may have significant implications for the transport of XML data, as it starts to address one of the fundamental limitations of XML as a protocol framework, viz the difficulty/awkwardness of including non-textual data in an XML envelope structure.  </s>
<s> SOAP is one such envelope structure, but there are others proposed.  </s>
<s> Note that some XML-based protocol frameworks (e.g. BEEP, APEX) address this problem by explicitly by embracing MIME structures to enclose the XML content.  </s>
<s> But many others (notably SOAP) don't.  </s>
<s> I think the framework described by the SOAP attachment feature is OK as far as it goes, but it explicitly does not specify a particular structure for compound messages, other than a vague hand-wave in the direction of MIME and DIME.  </s>
<s> One of the concerns noted is to avoid interference between the MIME encapsulation and the XML content.  </s>
<s> I think it can be argued that many features have been incorporated into MIME that may have been reasonable in MIME's original role but which are not really needed for a general compound message format.  </s>
<s> If one adopts the view that MIME is going to be a significant application protocol element for the foreseeable future, I think there may be a case for constructing a profile of MIME that focuses only on those features relevant to message transfer, and dropping the "metadata" and other structured information that sits more comfortably in an XML envelope structure.  </s>
<s> Thus, we could end up with a layering something like this:  </s>
<s> application data | XML message metadata | MIME encapsulation | (wire protocols) |  </s>
<s> (Which is pretty much what one would end up with by transferring SOAP over HTTP.) #g  </s>
