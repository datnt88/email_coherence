Hi All, short question about the examples in the "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" PR: The section "2.2 General Problems with re-Enveloping" contains this babe: xmlns:n0="foo:bar" My question is: Is this a relative namespace? 
xmlns:n0="urn:foo" is not, but the above? 
Christian Yes, it is. 
There is a protocol ('foo') and the "path" ('bar'). 
Aleksey. 
Hi all, Aleksey has already provided the argument, but I guess that he wanted to answer Christian's question with "no", since the question was Regards, Gregor It is not a relative URI. 
It does not meet the production rule for a relative URI. 
relativeURI = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ "?" query ] (As Merlin surmises, perhaps this is what Aleksey meant.) Yes, I really mean that this URI is *absolute* :) Sorry for confusion.
