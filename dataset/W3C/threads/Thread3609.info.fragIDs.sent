I have just this second received a new version of Phil's FAQ and uploaded it to the server.

I thought I asked 'Mozilla/Netscape composer' to be added when I gave my feedback. 
I wonder why Mozilla was dropped in the released version. 
(apparently there's a PR issue with Mozilla) Please, use this line (there's a typo - Linix instead of Linux - as well.) instead. 
Mozilla/Netscape Composer (Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux, OS/2, VMS, BeOS) Netscape Composer (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linix) 
Character encoding for a document can be set here: View  Character 
Coding menu. 
A file can be saved using a different character encoding here: File  Save As Charset. 
In Notepad/Wordpad section, it might as well be noted that Notepad on Win2k offers only four choices, 'ANSI' (the codepage corresponding to the default system locale), 'Unicode' (meaning UTF-16LE on ix86), 'Unicode Big endian', and UTF-8. 
I added several codepages to be supported in Intl/Regional setting control panel, but Notepad's offering didn't change. 
In Vim section, platforms supported are missing. 
It's ported to many OS' (http://www.vim.org/download.php) : Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux, Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2 etc. BTW, there's a brand-new HTML filetype plugin that can automate charset/lang setting in the future (http://www.infynity.spodzone.com/vim/HTML/). 
It doesn't do that yet (so it's not for FAQ), but I wrote to the author of the plugin that the feature would be very handy.
