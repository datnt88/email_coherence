<s> The comment raised in in the depths of section 4.4 We note with admiration the excellent tutorial introduction to the striped syntax in Section 2 [36]http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax].  </s>
<s> We are less happy with the nature of the syntax, and with the approach taken to its normative statement [37]http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Infoset-Grammar]  </s>
<s> As regards the syntax itself, we would much prefer to have seen a move to a single canonical syntax with much less variablity.  </s>
<s> With respect, the current design suggests that the value of XML has been misunderstood.  </s>
<s> The range of alternative forms of expression provided for in the current design make it very difficult to use the broad range of generic XML tools (e.g. syntax-directed editors, XSLT) which could give so much benefit to RDF users.  </s>
<s> (More on this below.)  </s>
<s> At the very least we would encourage you to specify a single canonical form, probably strictly striped, which could be defined by an XML Schema or DTD.  </s>
<s> We would be happy to work with you to develop a schema for such a subset.  </s>

<s> A canonical syntax for RDF/XML - a syntax format that matched the RDF abstract syntax one-to-one - was something that the RDF Core WG considered.  </s>
<s> However it was already known that RDF/XML could not express all RDF graphs: (this has got better with the addition of the rdf:nodeID construct) and was unconstrained in the choice of XML qnames when it was designed in 1999.  </s>
<s> This means RDF/XML isn't very suitable for defining with an XML schema language such as W3C XML Schema or DTDs.  </s>
<s> This would have meant inventing a new XML format, which was out of RDF Core's charter: [[The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax, ...]] -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter  </s>
<s> For testing purposes, RDF Core did design a small and complete non-XML format called N-Triples which has proved very useful in precisely writing down test cases from WG decisions but isn't suitable as an end-user canonical syntax.  </s>
<s> We appreciate the XML Schema WG's offer for help with design of new XML syntaxes.  </s>

<s> a) can represent all the RDF graphs that RDF/XML can represent b) can be described by an DTD or by XML Schema.  </s>
<s> An alternative would be to define a new syntax that is describable with a DTD or an XML Schema but doing so is beyond the scope of RDFCore's current charter.  </s>
<s> We note that the XHTML WG have expressed interest in working on such a syntax and have been encouraged to do so by RDFCore.  </s>
