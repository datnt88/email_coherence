<s> Section 8.7 of draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-01.ps says: If multiple encodings have been applied to a resource, the encoding-mechanisms must be listed in the order in which they were applied.  </s>
<s> I think this is backward.  </s>
<s> I think they should be listed in the order in which they must be applied by the client in the order they're listed.  </s>
<s> Consider foo.gz.Z.  </s>
<s> Gzip was applied first, then compress.  </s>
<s> NCSA HTTP 1.3 produces this header: Content-Encoding: x-compress, x-gzip (It looks like the old CERN code I have doesn't support multiple encodings.)  </s>

<s> I didn't think anyone did, but that interpretation is ugly.  </s>
<s> Message header field values should be "added" via an append operation.  </s>
<s> Thus, each encoding becomes layered, and Content-Encoding: first Content-Encoding: second has the same semantics as Content-Encoding: first, second If we reverse the order, then added headers must be prepended.  </s>

<s> Ugly or not, it exists.  </s>
<s> Whether anyone actually uses it is another matter.  </s>
<s> That makes sense (aesthetically) if you assume that these encodings are applied dynamically.  </s>
<s> Often they have already been applied to static files (e.g., my example), in which case you have to reconstruct the encodings outside-in.  </s>
<s> From an implementation standpoint, it's easier to do it the way NCSA has done it.  </s>
