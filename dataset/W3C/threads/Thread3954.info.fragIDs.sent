Here is the latest suggested text and Jurisdiction Extension spec: please review the text as I don't think we discussed it in the call. 
Jurisdiction Disclosure: We suggest that an Jurisdiction extension be added to the recipient element: [??] Extension Jurisdiction 
` /Extension Jurisdiction 
` JURISDICTION 
service=" quoted-URI 
[" short-description=" quotedstring] [" long-description=" quotedstring] " " 
/JURISDICTION " 
Example: EXTENSION JURISDICTION service="http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CE LEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=31995L0046&amp;model=guichett" short-description="EU law" 
long-description="This service operates within the EU" /JURISDICTION 
Text for specification: 
The jurisdiction extension element allows user agents to make judgements about the trustworthiness of a data recipient based on the regulatory environment they are placed in. 
For example organizations within the European Union can be assumed to comply to European data protection law. 
Some jurisdictions prohibit transfer of data to certain other jurisdictions without the explicit consent of the data subject. 
Therefore declaring a data 
transfer activity using the P3P jurisdiction extension is not sufficient to guarantee its legality.

We should make it clear that the jurisdiction is the jurisdiction of the recipient (not the entity). 
For consistency, LONG-DESCRIPTION should be a sub-element rather than an attribute.

I had the same question. 
But if one declares ours / in the recipient field, this means entity and some more agents. 
Giles, please invite them to provide a stable legal URI. 
The URI you just inserted contains illegal characters (&amp;) that have to be escaped in your example (.s/&amp;/\&amp;amp\;/g) 
I would not say trustworthiness, as one could always lie in a declaration. 
It is more that an entity or recipient can declare that they adhere to some jurisdiction and that they don't transfer stuff to unsecure jurisdictions without notice. 
Best, Rigo 
OK agreed - How about this then: Jurisdiction Disclosure: We suggest that an Jurisdiction extension be added to the recipient element: 
jurisdiction= " JURISDICTION" 
service=" quoted-URI 
[" short-description=" quotedstring] " " [longdescription] 
longdescription= LONG-DESCRIPTION PCDATA /LONG-DESCRIPTION Example: EXTENSION JURISDICTION service="http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/ sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CE LEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=31995L0046&amp;model=guichett" short-description="EU law" 
Text for specification: The jurisdiction extension element allows user agents to make judgements about the trustworthiness of a data recipient based on the regulatory environment they are placed in. 
Jurisdictions of recipients can be rendered machine readable by inserting a known URI into the service field (e.g. the URI of a body of legislation which applies). 
For example organizations within the European Union can be assumed to comply to European data protection law and could therefore insert the URI of the 95/46 directive as in the example above. 
Some jurisdictions prohibit transfer of data to certain other jurisdictions without the explicit consent of the data subject. 
It should be noted therefore declaring the data transfer activity of a recipient using the P3P jurisdiction extension is not sufficient to guarantee its legality. 
Looks good.
