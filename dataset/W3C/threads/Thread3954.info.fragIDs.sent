<s> We should make it clear that the jurisdiction is the jurisdiction of the recipient (not the entity).  </s>
<s> For consistency, LONG-DESCRIPTION should be a sub-element rather than an attribute.  </s>

<s> I had the same question.  </s>
<s> But if one declares ours / in the recipient field, this means entity and some more agents.  </s>
<s> Giles, please invite them to provide a stable legal URI.  </s>
<s> The URI you just inserted contains illegal characters (&amp;) that have to be escaped in your example (.s/&amp;/\&amp;amp\;/g)  </s>
<s> I would not say trustworthiness, as one could always lie in a declaration.  </s>
<s> It is more that an entity or recipient can declare that they adhere to some jurisdiction and that they don't transfer stuff to unsecure jurisdictions without notice.  </s>

<s> For example organizations within the European Union can be assumed to comply to European data protection law and could therefore insert the URI of the 95/46 directive as in the example above.  </s>
