Are you thinking about a prompt in an authoring tool? 
I think it is important to remember that the user (in this case the designer 
should be in control). 
So forcing the designer to do something at a certain moment, however important that is, might not be a very good idea. 
Designers in the middle of thinking/doing something else might easily just put something in the ALT text to be able to continue their current thought. 
And when that something is there it later seems that that part was already done, 
even though it was meant to be temporary. 
I think there is research to be done in how to best do this thing starting from the way designers design their pages. 
I'm not sure whose responsibility 
is what part of the design. 
Some of this is or at least should be done by the authoring tool companies. 
The solutions based on the research could include things like clearly highlighting the images with missing alt while the page is being designed, having a link check tool similar to a spelling check tool in a document that 
would point out all the problems with links when activated, having easy access to a help text that could explain with examples what is a good way to 
use alt text, having tools that show list of all the alt text strings in a site without or with the corresponding images and without or with the textual context so that it is easy to see wheather the ALT explanations make 
sense etc. 
There could also be databases with often used images that attach a default ALT text to an image e.g. a logo automatically if not overridden, so that the ALT would be more consistently used accross a site and the user wouldn't have to worry about it. 
These are just some examples that came to my mind. 
I'm not sure if I answered your question.

I think I have not been clear. 
When I said only the 'scavenger' was a fit subject for research, it was not because the editor plugin is not desirable. 
It is just so clearly desirable that our friends at the University of Toronto already have it under development. 
No need for research to demonstrate the utility. 
Please check over the minutes from the last ER WG telephone conference for a little information on what projects are underway and expected in this area.

Al wrote in regard to plugin to help author add ALT text 
No need for research to demonstrate the utility. 
LRK:: personally speaking, I'd certainly agree with that. 
What I was asking was whether research was required to design the specific user interface for a tool to add ALT text. 
Marja raised some potential research issues. 
Here's some thoughts on some issues Marja raised: 
designer 
done, 
responsibility 
LRK:: I think that, since this could be offered as a standalone tool for fixing a web page via human intervention, it could fall within the scope of er-ig's work. 
One variable is the number of people designing the page. 
Is there just one "designer"? 
Or a team, with different people responsible for overall story, art, text copy, like in the print advertising industry. 
If it's a team, how would we facilitate collaborative work? 
that 
way to 
make 
LRK:: One way to research this is to take a best shot and do usability testing with actual users. 
Al, or Chris, could you tell us if these features are already planned? 
That would open usability testing. 
Alternatively, there are various levels of prototyping.

Advance information on what is planned is available to members of this group. 
Please see Chris's post to the working group for details: Linkname: w3c-wai-er-wg@w3.org from October 1998 by date URL: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-wg/1998Oct/ Linkname: A-Prompt Web Site Toronto is eager to get feedback on these plans. 
Because of what the WAI offers by gathering a world-wide, cross-disability span of experts, they are taking extra pains to listen to members and especially consensus from the WAI ER groups.

Thanks Al for the A-prompt info in Chris's email. 
That email says to get the URL from chris by sending email to chris.ridpath@utoronto.ca 
That's to keep it private. 
Since the archives for this group is public, I assume that we'll need to follow that procedure instead of posting the URL on this email list. 
Right, Chris?

We're not advertising the site URL until we get the site a bit more organized. 
If you would like the URL, please send me an email (chris.ridpath@utoronto.ca).
