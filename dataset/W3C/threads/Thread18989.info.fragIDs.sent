<s> This question is forwarded with permission from Astrid Callista: What is meant (in checkpoint 1.3 [1]) by "accessible modules"?  </s>
<s> Are these modules created by the author of the program?  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020617#cp1_3 - "1.3 Reuse existing accessibility modules to indicate alternative-equivalent associations".  </s>
<s> From acomments I sent last October on XAG [1]:  </s>
<s> IJ: I think I prefer might be "accessibility modules" to "accessible modules".  </s>
<s> I think it might be useful to preface the requirement a little with something like: "When building a format out of smaller modules, reuse proven accessibility modules."  </s>
<s> Why would one only be interested in reuse of modules related to alternative equivalents?  </s>
<s> Are there other functionalities that benefit accessibility (e.g., metadata) that might be reusable?  </s>
<s> I also suggested mergin 2.9 with 1.3 into: "Reuse modules, and reuse them appropriately."  </s>
<s> Can one define an "XML Module"?  </s>

<s> I think that merging 2.9 and 1.3 might be a smart way to go.  </s>
<s> What we mean is that rather than inventing another way of doing something, use a piece of an existing XML language.  </s>
<s> Alternative content isn't the only issue - the ability to provide navigation points, or containers, is another example.  </s>
<s> For incorporating graphics, SVG would be something that can be used.  </s>
<s> (I have seen other languages incorporate graphics directly in the markup, and they use a horribly inaccessible method - include the data that makes a jpeg).  </s>
<s> I would like to propose that as a technique.  </s>
<s> This need not occur only when people have decided to build from existing modules - it is a good practise anyway (and it can be done whether using an approach like modularisation or building an entire DTD from scratch).  </s>
