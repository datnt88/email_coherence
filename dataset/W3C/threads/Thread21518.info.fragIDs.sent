<s> The issue calls for indicating that information items carrying URIs as values should be specified in section as having a type of xsd:anyURI.  </s>
<s> After looking through the SOAP envelope defined EIs that carry URIs, all have mention of being of type xsd:anyURI in section 5. It would therefore seem as replication to add it in section 6 as well.  </s>
<s> Schemas' definition of anyURI [2] explicitly calls out the relationship between IRIs, URIs, and anyURI: "The mapping from anyURI values to URIs is as defined in Section 5.4 Locator Attribute of [XML Linking Language] (see also Section 8 Character Encoding in URI References of [Character Model]).  </s>
<s> This means that a wide range of internationalized resource identifiers can be specified when an anyURI is called for, and still be understood as URIs per [RFC 2396], as amended by [RFC 2732], where appropriate to identify resources."  </s>
<s> IMO, we have nothing to add regarding this issue as it is a) outside the  </s>
<s> scope of SOAP and b) addressed by the schema spec already.  </s>
<s> I don't think we have anything to say about how URIs can be carried outside the SOAP Envelope.  </s>
<s> For example, how the request-URI is encoded  </s>
<s> in an HTTP request is HTTP's problem and not ours.  </s>
<s> I do not support that SOAP should see it as a requirement to dictate rules on SMTP, HTTP, etc.  </s>
<s> In summary, I think we can close this issue with no action.  </s>

<s> He raised the issue with some care and goes into some detail, and I worry that we will antagonize our reviewers if they try to tell us where they find the spec unclear, and we say "sure it's clear, trust us, we know it well."  </s>
