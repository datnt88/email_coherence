shows a very messed up table of student sites was this fixed at same time you fixed recalcs for the other page i presented yesterday ... if not maybe it can be looked at too .... table is so mangled, it cant be used at all to get at sites that i wanted to test amaya on. 
these sites are all basic stuff -- hopefully valid as that is what i emphasis in course, and no tricks.
