Hello all, I am cross-posting this to a few lists. 
I apologize if you receive this more than once. 
I am trying to get a feel for how many people use browsers that support scripting of some sort, such as JavaScript. 
Could you please respond to the following six questions?

I run lynx and amaya (no javascript) and netscape, opera and windows (javascript). 
I leave scripts on where applicable, but I only run pages on those browsers if they are unusable on lynx. 
I do not normally use an assistive techology.
