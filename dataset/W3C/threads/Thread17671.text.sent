Hello, I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18 as defined in the 16 July draft [2]. 
In that draft, they read: - Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been visited - Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the document. 
- Make available whether following a link will involve a fee. 
In light of decisions at the 4 August teleconf [3], I propose the following checkpoints: 1) Make available information about a link that will enable the user to decide whether to follow the link. 
[Priority 3] NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and what is the expected natural language of the link target. 
2) Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee. 
[Priority 2]. 
NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user interface provided the interface is accessible. 
Thus, any prompt asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible. 
For checkpoint 2, please note that this was agreed upon at the 4 August teleconference.

I would add the type of the object at the other end of the link to useful information, but otherwise it looks good to me Charles McCN Hello, I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18 as defined in the 16 July draft [2].

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Hello, The proposal below addresses link-related checkpoints in guideline 9 (Orientation). 
However, in [2], there are link-related checkpoints related to graphical rendering of link information: 7.12 Provide a mechanism (e.g., through style sheets) to distinguish visited links from unvisited links. 
[Priority 3] Note. 
Using color as the only distinguishing factor does not suffice since color may not be perceivable by all users or rendered by all devices. 
7.13 Allow the user to specify (e.g., through style sheets) that images used in links must have borders. 
[Priority 3] Should these checkpoints be folded into the ones proposed below, or do they merit a separate existence? 
As written, 7.12 would fit into the first checkpoint proposed below. 
However, 7.13 says "Use a visual highlighting mechanism to tell people this image is a link." 
Checkpoint 7.13 doesn't quite fall under 1.2: "Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements of a document in a device-independent manner." 
since it suggests (to me) activation, not recognition of a link. 
I propose that we modify 7.13 and move it to guideline 6 (user control of styles) or guideline 9 (orientation, where similar checkpoints reside): Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard interface where available) active elements of a document. 
For example, allow the user to specify that images in links be rendered with borders. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Responses in JRG: JRG: 7.12 seems to be dealing with the same issue as the new checkpoint proposed for determining whether a link should be followed or not. 
SO I think they should be combined. 
JRG: I like the change, since it is device dependent. 
This could even relate to auditory interfaces saying "link" before saying the link text. 
I think wherevere possible we should minimize the use of visual references.
