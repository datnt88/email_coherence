<s> as a follow-up of discussion on www-ql@w3.org about syntax issues: I suggest, if it is not too late, the following change:  </s>
<s> - make optional the separator ';' between prolog declarations.  </s>
<s> (unless this creates a real lexical issue but it doesn't seem to be the case.)  </s>
<s> Though the semicolon can improve readability in some cases, it is both heavy, ugly and unnecessary after functions or variable initializations.  </s>
<s> To me, making them optional is the worst possible approach - XQuery processors would still need to be able to parse the language with or without the semicolons.  </s>
<s> If we were to do that, it would be better to simply remove the semicolons so everybody writes queries with the same syntax.  </s>
<s> But the semicolons do make error reporting easier, and simplify parsing of the language.  </s>
<s> More importantly, they also make it more likely that future versions of XQuery will have the flexibility they need to extend the language.  </s>
<s> Jonathan  </s>
<s> Right, optional semicolons is not the best possible idea.  </s>
<s> I did it in Qizx only to keep compatibility with former syntax.  </s>
<s> In fact, semicolons should be *terminators* on simple declarations, and not separators.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, I prefer a simple rule ("a declaration ends with a semicolon") to any rule that has exceptions ("a declaration ends with a semicolon except if it is a function declaration...)  </s>
<s> Yet this is exactly how it is in mainstream languages like Java, Javascript, C, C++, C#, to name a few...  </s>
<s> Why wouldn't XQuery adopt a usual approach, rather than inventing a new one?  </s>
<s> 1. Semicolons at the end of declarations simplify parsing of the language - not only for recognition, but also for error detection, making it possible to give good error messages.  </s>
<s> This is hardly a good reason for introducing them.  </s>
<s> Easiness-of-implementation considerations should not influence the design of a language, IMHO.  </s>
<s> 1. Semicolons at the end of declarations simplify parsing of the language - not only for recognition, but also for error detection, making it possible to give good error messages.  </s>
<s> That's nothing to do with ease of implementation.  </s>
<s> You can only give good error messages (and recover to report multiple errors in a single run) if the language has sufficient redundancy.  </s>
<s> That's a question of language design, not of how clever the implementation is.  </s>
<s> Redundancy in language syntax (as with any other kind of input data) leads to better error detection.  </s>
<s> Without semicolons, when you write something like import schema "ns.uri" "location.uri"  </s>
<s> you are going to get the error message *** Type error: Cannot add a string and an integer while import schema "ns.uri" "location.uri" 3 will give you *** Unexpected token "3" beyond end of expression With semicolons, the construct import schema "ns.uri" "location.uri";  </s>
<s> will give you the much clearer error message *** Syntax error: Expected 'at' or ';', found string literal "location.uri"  </s>
<s> Michael Kay  </s>
<s> Hi Xavier, Personally, I think it's time to stop worrying about minor syntactic details of XQuery if we ever want to get done.  </s>
<s> People can reasonably disagree about whether a declaration should end with a semicolon.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's reasonable to spend a lot of time on this issue.  </s>
<s> Jonathan  </s>
