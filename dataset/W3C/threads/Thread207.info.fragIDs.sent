This version seems to include extra blank space between paragraphs which the previous one didn't. 
Perhaps the new enclose-text option has done this?

Greetings. 
I'm new to the list, but have really enjoyed using html-tidy for about 7 months now. 
Thanks for the great product! 
Will Tidy ever have a minimalist mode? 
I'd like to save some network bandwidth. 
What I have been doing is setting wrap length to 999 &amp; turning indentation off. 
This doesn't remove things like 1. extra vertical whitespace 2. syntactically unnecessary newlines 3. trailing whitespace from a line I'm always trying to trim a few bytes here and there. 
Any thoughts anyone?

Ah, you want an HTML UnTIDY :-D But seriously, I use TIDY to validate my HTML while developing and then run it through another program, HTML Compressor I think its called (I'm not at my regular computer so I can't tell you) when the page is complete.

Cool! Anyone have a C implementation of such a beast? 
Thanks, --jim 
It was intentional, as previously I found it hard to visually sort out one element from another. 
I'm sorry that I forgot to mention this in the release notes.
