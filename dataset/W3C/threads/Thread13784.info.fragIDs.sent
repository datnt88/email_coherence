<s> Frames are a mechnism of _displaying_ different pieces of content in independent windows in _scrolling medium_ It is impossible to make sense of frames in other media such as print.  </s>
<s> In other words, frames are a presentational hint, for particular media.  </s>
<s> Therefore, stylesheets should be used for making frames.  </s>
<s> I am not isolated in this opinion: "...Frames aren't considered as the way to go.  </s>
<s> CSS2 and its positioning capabilities is the preferred way."  </s>
<s> Arnaud Le Hors in The WAI authoring guidelines should state clearly: "Frames only via stylesheets".  </s>
<s> HTML4.0 includes frames as a requirement from browsers, for backward compatibility with existing documents, not as a recommendation for authors.  </s>
<s> (see citation above, again) People who wrote these existing documents aren't going to read the WAI guidelines anyway since they are doing cool things and don't care about the purist nerds from W3C or about their own readers.  </s>
<s> Have you ever seen a frames site written in valid HTML4.0?  </s>
<s> I didn't.  </s>
<s> You know why?  </s>
<s> Only authors who care about portability write valid documents.  </s>
<s> But authors who care about portability don't write frames.  </s>
<s> A realistic goal of WAI is to avoid new sites written in HTML frames.  </s>
<s> For achieving this, one has to be very clear against HTML frames.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, it is not possible to duplicate frame semantics with CSS2 and HTML 4 alone.  </s>
<s> Special values of the HTML 4 "target" attribute (see [1], section 6.16) allow authors to specify the window in which a document is meant to appear.  </s>
<s> While CSS2 positioning allows authors to create frame-like appearance within a single window, CSS2 does not allow authors to refer to other windows.  </s>
<s> This is one reason why frames weren't "more deprecated" in HTML 4.0; the target window behavior could not be reproduced in CSS. - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>

<s> Therefore, stylesheets should be used for making frames.  </s>
<s> While I cannot stand most framed pages, I understand why the functionality is there.  </s>
<s> For example, Hotmail.com allows you to read mail, and if the mail has a link to another page, choosing the link just modifies the current page.  </s>
<s> The Hotmail.com navigation bar at the top stays the same, allowing you to return quickly to the original mail message if you surfed your way through to several pages.  </s>
<s> This is not something that can be accomplished through CSS positioning.  </s>

<s> Most of the uses of frames may be done with CSS2 and the authoring guidelines should point that out.  </s>
<s> Example (accounts for 95% of current frames use): Frames are used to create a navigation bar which is fixed on the user's viewport, and another frame is used for "content" which may be replaced by following links on the navigation bar.  </s>
<s> This can be done with CSS2 by writing the navigaton bar in all pages (as one does in a site without frames) and position the navigation bar fixed with respect to the viewport using CSS2.  </s>
<s> CSS2 has the following advantages: The problem of addressing a position of frames with a URL disappears, the concept of the user's current location is well defined, the confusion of what is the user's history disappears.  </s>
<s> Moreover, with HTML frames the navigation bar has an active link to the content page that the user is reading.  </s>
<s> This reduces user's orientation.  </s>
<s> With CSS2 we are like in normal pages where the author can disactivate the "self link".  </s>
<s> So with CSS2, the good thing about frames stays: keeping the navigation bar fixed relative to the viewport.  </s>
<s> But all the usability and orientation problems of HTML frames go away.  </s>
<s> The authoring guidelines may have an appendix (like they have for graphical bullets in lists) concerning CSS2 frames.  </s>
<s> I have also seen frames site that the fixed frame is just a decorative margin (not even a message conveying banner), this accounts for 4% of frame sites), this can be done with fixed position background images.  </s>
<s> This CSS feature is already supported by some browsers.  </s>
<s> It seems to me more useful to recommend CSS rather than recommending: "use the title attribute to describe the function of the frame: FRAME src="foo.html"  </s>
