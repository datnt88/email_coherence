<s> Yes, all modifications to the baseline collection are illegal -- in many implementations the collection will be a 'virtual' reflection of the contents of the baseline.  </s>
<s> Clearly there is already the mechanism within DAV to disallow these methods (e.g., supported method set) but calling them regular version-controlled resources is misleading -- they are in no way 'regular'.  </s>

<s> The definition of the DAV:baseline-collection property states: "each member of this collection has the same DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a member of the baseline-controlled collection at the time the baseline was created" I believe this makes it sufficiently clear that no operations that would add/remove/change members of the DAV:baseline-collection are allowed.  </s>

<s> But the "MUST have" change is certainly an improvement.  </s>
<s> The only way to get access to this collection is through the DAV:baseline-collection property of a baseline, so I'm not sure that this is reasonably characterized as being "buried" (i.e. you'll have to read this property definition if you are ever going to access the baseline collection).  </s>

<s> I'd prefer not to define the term "baseline collection" because it is easy to confuse it with "baseline-controlled collection".  </s>
<s> This preference may be colored by the re-pagination that would be required to add it now (:-), so it would be worth re-raising the issue when we go to "draft standard".  </s>

<s> A collection identified by a DAV:baseline-collection property cannot be modified.  </s>
<s> I like the definition because it makes it clear that a Baseline Collection captures not only version-controlled resources (as the current specification incorrectly hints) but that it also captures any collections needed to get to those VCRs (in the namespace).  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree that the current definition of DAV:baseline-collection could make this more explicit (although it does state that the relative names of the members must be the same, which really does mandate the introduction of those intermediate collections).  </s>
<s> How about the following: The last sentence of the DAV:baseline-collection is actually redundant, because it follows from the CHECKIN preconditions.  </s>
<s> If I delete that sentence, I have room to emphasizes the creation of any needed intermediate collections.  </s>
<s> In particular, the revised definition of DAV:baseline-collection would be: "This property contains a server-defined URL for a collection, where each member of this collection either is a version-controlled resource with the same DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a version-controlled member of the baseline-controlled collection at the time the baseline was created, or is a collection needed to provide the relative name for a version-controlled resource."  </s>
