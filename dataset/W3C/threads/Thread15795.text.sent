Seems to me a lot (I mean a very lot) of web sites are bring done through places like Geocities, Tripod, Angelfire, etc. 
Most of those web sites have owners who do not know what html really is. 
They just go in and fill out forms, and VOILA! 
They this exciting, graphically jazzy site that is really cool. 
I don't even think a tiny, tiny part of the people who have web sites even know what accessibility is. 
So, do these web editors have to conform to making accessible sites or the person filling out the form? 
Unfortunatley, they may not want to give up all the pizazz on their site,either, even if they took the time to educate themselves on the fact that people other than sighted ones surf the net. 
When I found out, I felt I just had to do what I could to make my sites accessible. 
(Everyone should have a chance to visit my wonderful site---*laughs*) I can not give an opinion as to whether govenment should involve themselves or not, and if they do, is that so bad? 
When you come right down to it, we are the government, right? 
*Sigh* This is my two-cents worth.

Except you don't have to give up pizazz in order to make a site that can be used by blind people.

The voice of the future?

After living in DC for the past four years. 
The term "We are the government" is something politicians and lobbyist inside the capital beltway want you to believe. 
In reality, "We the people" better have lobbyist, senators, congressmen and their staffers on their side. 
Or else it wont get done. 
The most powerful people in DC are the senators and congressmen's staffers. 
These are normally kids out of college or professional staffers who watch the bills and make recommendations to the representative. 
If you do not believe me, a General will volunteer to carry a staffers luggage. 
If you want obtain support from a politician, get to know their staff. 
There are plenty of lobbyist who are ex-staffers. 
A politician will vote his party line first and his special interest second. 
No where does "We the people" exist" -- just look at the last budget bill. 
So for all those people on the WAI Interest Group who want to do something of significance instead of demanding change, here is your chance. 
You must do two things: call and email your congressman, and state and local representatives. 
DO THIS EVERYTIME YOU COME ACROSS AN INACCESSIBLE GOVERNMENT, STATE OR LOCAL WEB SITE. 
The reason I say two things is there are starting to get so much email, it is going unread. 
You also need to include your name, address and phone number, so they know you are a constituent. 
This is a wake up call! 
People and friends of the WAI IG must be proactive to affect change. 
If you are from outside the USA, then please forward this information to a WAI member who is in the USA! 
If you do not know who is your US and State congressman or senator, then go to http://www.infospace.com/ and select the Government Link and you find your Government Federal, State, Local, Officials, Embassies. 
When in doubt, call your Board of Elections. 
I cannot make recommendations for people in other countries as I do not know their government processes. 
Its your call, so what are you going to do? 
Sit by and whine to friends or be proactive! 
Does someone have disk space where inaccessible sites can be posted. 
I thought someone had started this? 
More than my two cents, Rob
