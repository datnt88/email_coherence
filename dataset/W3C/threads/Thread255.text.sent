Dear Dave, Thanks for the 22 Oct 99 update. 
It fixes a number of known bugs. 
Just thought you should know about a very minor problem - in the "tidy22oct99.tgz" 
archive (which is what I use as my base source), you forgot this time to include the 2 GIF files needed for Overview.html. 
It doesn't affect me, but a first time user may be affected. 
Regards, Terry In the Release Notes for the newest Tidy is this paragraph: Andre Hinrichs wanted Tidy to do a better job on font elements with relative size changes. 
This is in fact rather tricky. 
Currently, Tidy uses percentage scaling values for fonts rather than the enumeration defined by CSS [xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large | x-large | xx-large]. 
The first problem is to match these 7 values onto the 6 define by the font element. 
The next problem is caused by the fact that CSS doesn't provide matching relative font size values that you could match to the ones defined for the font element. 
I have done my best using percentage values, base on tests with IE and Navigator. 
If anyone can come up with a better approach, please let me know. 
Todd Fahrner has tackled with this issue like no one else. 
See and in particular (mentioned at the bottom of the above): /Jelks Tidy still drops things like and, most noteworthily: which one may not want to occur. 
Not sure if this should be covered by something like a drop-empty-elements: bool or if leaving them alone should not also be the default if there is an ID or CLASS (or any attribute?). 
In the case with IDs in particular, one may intend to *insert* content using the DOM (I have myself had this need). 
I would think that (and this would apply [x]HTML as well as generic XML docs) one would *not* want to have empty-content elements removed. 
In general, that is -- the exception being "drop-empty-paras" in [x]HTML, which was instituted for the reasons noted. 
One could get around Tidy's stripping those by saying and thus actually providing some content, but *should* that be required? 
/Jelks
