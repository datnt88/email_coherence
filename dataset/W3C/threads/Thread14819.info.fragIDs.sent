<s> Dear GL Listmembers, As part of the New Year we are trying to follow the W3C process guidelines for our group more closely.  </s>
<s> One of the components is the maintaining of a list of active members of the working group that are in good standing.  </s>
<s> Generally the working group is made up of a small group  </s>
<s> of people who meet consistently and regularly.  </s>
<s> Such members are expected to attend most all of the working group sessions.  </s>
<s> Members who do not attend at least 2/3 of the meetings are usually not considered in good standing.  </s>
<s> In our work we have many who cannot meet this standard for active membership but who do still contribute on the list or periodically.  </s>
<s> They don't fit the W3C definition of active members in good standing but we want you all to know that we value your/their contributions very much and find them an integral part of our work.  </s>
<s> For those interested in the list of the current active members in good standing you will find it posted on our GL website at To this group -- thanks for all your time and dedication.  </s>
<s> The workgroups are well named.  </s>
<s> It is a lot of work and we appreciate your particular dedication to the group.  </s>
<s> To the rest of our unofficial extended working group and contributors, keep up the good work.  </s>
<s> Thanks Gregg Vanderheiden Jason White WCAG Co Chairs  </s>
<s> Some of us (e.g. the unemployed) have difficulties making weekly lengthy long-distance calls.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need to reconsider our method of meeting.  </s>

<s> I agree guys.  </s>
<s> I'd love to join some of the groups, but am unable to attend the meetings, so I've held off because I don't want to be in bad standing.  </s>
<s> We should think of a way to redo our meetings.  </s>

<s> Speaking for myself.  </s>
<s> My goal isn't to have my name on a "list".  </s>
<s> But at the same time I don't want to be placed on a "bad" list because of some unknown reason.  </s>
<s> At this point in time I feel that I have met the requirements for the short period of time I have been part of the group.  </s>
<s> And I fully intend to continue to do so.  </s>
<s> That's why I joined the group.  </s>

<s> To be placed on a "bad" list makes me feel that I'm not doing my part.  </s>
<s> If I'm not, tell me what to do to fulfill my obligation.  </s>

<s> I think it's not just the name on the list that's all that important, but it is important to recognize that many of us are volunteering our time (and our expenses) to participate, too.  </s>
<s> Those of us who are active -- and I'm not saying I am or am not, only questioning how the rules are applied -- should at least receive recognition.  </s>
<s> I'm more concerned that the W3C procedures don't seem to be followed except in part.  </s>
<s> This leads me to some confusion at to how exactly the working group is being run, and whether or not that will be a barrier to getting more and/or more-interested people involved.  </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that the question of "who is on the list" was not raised by anyone wanting to be on a list, but rather by the working group chairs publishing -- for whatever reason -- a list of "members in good standing."  </s>
<s> --Kynn PS: I currently have an action item pending, and I was planning to take time out of my writing schedule this week and get it off my plate.  </s>
<s> However, as I am not a member of this working group, according to the official record, I am not sure why I should take the time to do so.  </s>
<s> No, I am not here purely for the public recognition, but on the other hand, if I'm told I am not "in good standing" -- then why am I spending any time on this?  </s>

<s> I am a disabled user who must utilize special accessories to operate my PC. My reason for joining The Group was to learn about and possibly contribute toward the formation of useful guidelines regarding accessibility issues on the Web.  </s>
<s> I guess that I'm not in good standing because I have not attended any online meetings, face-to-face sessions or meetings.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, I be able to attend in the future.  </s>
<s> I am not a Web scholar or designer, but I did submit a webpage for Web Validation last year located at: and somehow duplicated itself and definitely not up to your standards.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I enjoyed building it.  </s>
<s> And, despite the fact that now (as opposed to those 1986 photos) I am severely crippled, and wheelchairbound, I am still able to "soar like an eagle" just about anywhere on the WWW.  </s>
<s> So, thank you Active Participants for helping me understand some of the complicated steps involved in making the Web more accessible for all of us.  </s>
<s> With Great Appreciation, Gwendolyn  </s>
<s> I intend too.  </s>
<s> Currently I am mobile most Fridays.  </s>
<s> Also, I have yet to arrange a budget phone plan, because I am ringing the USA from Australia in peak time at my own expense.  </s>
<s> I hope to be available in the coming weeks.  </s>
