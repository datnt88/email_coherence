<s> I would say that your screen reader is trying to be extra smart, and has a bug in that.  </s>
<s> A map like you have described should be renderable directly.  </s>
<s> This is the new HTML 4 model (well, it was new 5 years ago) which adds block content (paragraphs, lists, text links, etc) to the things that can be in a map.  </s>
<s> In the old model the things in there were always invisible anyway, and they were all "area" elements.  </s>

<s> This is invalid HTML, reflecting the fact that you are abusing the MAP element.  </s>
<s> MAP is required to have a name attribute, because it only makes sense in the context of a USEMAP.  </s>
<s> You also are in violatin of a *should* requirement on the A elements; the syntax of SGML doesn't really allow the DTD to enforce the requirement that A elements specify regions.  </s>
<s> Map is not a general means of grouping links, but specifically for image maps.  </s>
<s> A graphical browser, with images on, will not render it.  </s>
<s> HTML 4 introduced the concept of the map element as a general method for grouping links.  </s>
<s> This was reinforced in HTML 4.01 when it was changed to allow what already worked - text links and area elements being mixed (for backwards compatibility).  </s>
<s> You are correct about hte name attribute being required, although this probably would have changed if we had done an even better job.  </s>
<s> If the map element contains block content, and not just area elements, then it should be rendered by graphical browsers, and the only one I know of that didn't is amaya, where it is a registered bug that may have been fixed now.  </s>

<s> (please provide not only name, but version number, as well - choose "Help" and then "About" to discern) the second question to be asked is: 2. did you change any of the screen reader's default settings? the third essential question is: 3. what browser are you using?  </s>

<s> Hi Gregory I'm using Home Page Reader 3.0, which works with IE 5. I have changed some of the defaults, but none to do with "map" as you don't get the option.  </s>
<s> I tried your first example page with my test page, ie when it gets to the map element it reads "start of map with 0 items" then reads the links, then "end of map".  </s>
