<s> Hi, I am learning the HTTP protocol and one of the things I noticed is that it is stateless.  </s>
<s> When I was reading the 3253, it mentions that there are  </s>
<s> states.  </s>
<s> So far I have identified these groupings on states: checked in vs checked out locked vs unlocked Is there a state chart diagram anywhere that explains all of the states and transitions for this protocol?  </s>
<s> Additionally is RFC 3648's ORDERPATCH method generally supported by HTTP servers yet?  </s>

<s> The *protocol* is stateless.  </s>
<s> The resources you communicat with have state.  </s>
<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, only by one (SAP's Enterprise Portal server).  </s>

<s> Thank you very much for the infos.  </s>
