Dear Iain, Thanks for raising this issue! 
I see that you also posted it to usenet, so I am not breaching any confidences in forwarding it to others. 
This looks to be such a crass example, and in such an exposed place, that I'm taking the initiative of bringing it to the attention of the WAI Interest Group, who might have more practical experience than I have in the matter of bringing influence in the right places. 
Have you got any plausible email contact addresses for this, i.e that show any prospects of not being filtered out by the very web "designers" who are creating this monstrosity? 
As many UK subscribers to CIWAH may be aware, there's a big splurge due at the Number 10 Downing Street website http://www.number-10.gov.uk/ on the 29th of April, to be conducted by Sir David Frost no less. 
Tony Blair will be giving Europe's first live internet interview with a government leader. 
Having been alerted by today's Observer (Naughton again) to some HTML oddities appearing there, I thought I'd go in for a peep. 
From an accessibility standpoint, it's pretty grim to say the least. 
Perhaps some of the stalwarts of CIWAH might like to visit it and give their considered opinions. 
Remember, above all, that this is a public website, funded by UK taxpayers, including blind and other disadvantaged people - who as it stands, will fail to get anything meaningful from it. 
I'm sure Tony Blair would be totally astonished if he were to be made aware of this situation. 
Phundria - why the heck haven't you picked this one up?

Hello Alan / WAI I have now written, and posted by snail-mail, the following to the Prime Minister, CC'd to my local MP. 
Alia alia est. 
[The email address for No. 10 is PCartwright@pmo.gov.uk in case you missed my CIWAH posting] Dear Prime Minister, The No. 10 Downing Street Website I am writing to express my deep concern about some very serious accessibility problems affecting your website. 
I was alerted to this by an article by John Naughton in yesterday's 'Observer', and duly confirmed it by several personal visits to the site, and a subsequent posting to the web authoring newsgroup on the internet, which has elicited a prodigious response. 
Put simply, as the site now stands, it will be difficult or impossible for many blind and disadvantaged webnauts to gain access to it, and to participate in the forthcoming debate. 
I am sure Mr. Blunkett would be able to confirm this were he to visit using a speaking web browser. 
For the last eighteen months I have been active, both professionally and privately, in the cause of preserving the concept of universal access to the wonderful resource that is the web, just as was originally envisaged by its British creator. 
This is now actively under seige by commercial interests with a very different agenda. 
I am certain that it is their influence that has led directly to the accessibility problems with your website. 
Likewise, I am sure you will be as astonished and appalled as I was when the implications of this situation become clear to you. 
Few things in life are worse than bad things being done in the name of a good man. 
May I please ask you to look into this as a matter of urgency. 
To assist, I am attaching some (rather technical, I'm afraid) references which will lead to the relevant facts, and aid in putting things right. 
If I may be of any further assistance, I shall be delighted to help. 
Wishing you every success in the future, (etc., etc.) Attached: A reference to the CIWAH thread cited in the heading.

All the best, Iain Iain Logan, Langholm, Dumfriesshire - Chartered Transport Consultant Take me off this Fuckin mailing list or I will post all of you addresses to hack news and you will nolonger be !!!! 
I would like to change the world but, I dont have the source code.
