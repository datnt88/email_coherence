So, given the time tables at: Let's have pity for our US/Pacific participants and assume that anything between 9 and 11 is not suitable. 
This leaves with the following options: Monday: 11:00am-1:00pm Tuesday: 11:00am-1:00pm Wednesday: 12:00pm-1:00pm (regular conflict with xmlp call?) Friday: 11:00am-1:00pm If any of the time slots proposed above are not suitable for you, please so, and include if it is not suitable for this week and/or as a regular time. 
Philippe What time zone are these times presented in? 
PST? 
EST? 
GMT?

sorry. 
EST. 
Philippe The XMLP call is 2PM EST, so no that would not be a conflict. 
I could do any of these times, order of preference Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday. 
--Glen Monday bad. 
tuesday, wednesday, friday good, preferring wednesday. 
Value judgements are context sensitive. 
The time is moderately bad, but doable. 
Expect me to become coherent only after 9am PST.
