<s> How does a authoring tool put in ALT=""?  </s>
<s> To an authoring tool, a empty edit box means no text, not NULL text.  </s>
<s> I would have to manually edit the HTML source to put in ALT="" in the places where I wanted it.  </s>
<s> People are not likely to put in NULL ALT's anyway and this additional burden might sink the possibility altogether.  </s>

<s> Roger, It is rare that a spammed message gets through to our mailing list.  </s>
<s> It is an unfortunate fact that sometimes, these e-mail broadcast services get a list-serve address by some means.  </s>
<s> It is the price we have to pay for making our list open to the public.  </s>
<s> I hope, as do you, that we can get "unsubscribed" from their mailing list, but that is sometimes a very difficult task.  </s>
