Cheers, Jan Jan Richards UI Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) University of Toronto jan.richards@utoronto.ca 
A clarification: Actually, Judy Brewer will be the staff contact for the next 3 months. 
I will merely be assisting with some of the work on the group. 
New minutes are attached. 
- Jan belated regrets from Phill. 
But some input regarding some of the items discussed: Meeting in France: Is the W3C Technical Plenary in southern France, February 25 - March 1 2002 still on? 
Is this the best URL http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html? 
ATAG &amp; EO are listed as meeting, UAAG, GL, PF, etc are not. 
Phill plans to attend if both ATAG &amp; EO are meeting. 
WWW2002: Phill plans to attend if part of panel or paper presentation - so far no confirmation from www2002. 
Phill could represent IBM in proposed tools panels. 
Dublin Core: Phill currently has issue with them regarding duplicate or confusing standard for document language which conflicts or at lease duplicates with html lang= attribute. 
Nothing new to report on IBM portal tool.

Hi Phill, this seems like an issue that belongs in another WAI group, but I can't think of which one. 
If I do I'll send them a pointer to this thread. 
As I see it, Dublin Core are trying to categorise any resource available on the Web, and less and less of those will be HTML. 
So the fact that a Dublin Core statement duplicates an HTML attribute doesn't seem to be a problem - in fact if the information is in the HTML it should be easy to extract it for making accurate (or at least consistent) Dublin Core metadata, or take it from the metadata and include it in the page encoding. 
The same applies to the potential overlap between either of these and information provided by an HTTP header. 
So I propose a Technique for tools to meet WCAG checkpoints 13.2 and 4.3, for ATAG checkpoints 1.3 and 3.2: (applicable to all except programming tools, I think. 
Images don't often have a language, but audio often does...) If identifaction of the language of a document is available from any of + The document's markup (eg xml:lang attribute in XHTML, SVG, SMIL and others) + The HTTP headers of a document obtained from the Web + External metadata about the document, such as Dublin Core information propose the value to the value to the author (suggested, but necessary if there are conflicting values obtained) and use it for all of the above which are applicable.

Phill and Charles DC has just OK'd the new DC Accessibility IG and I am about to launch that - so that will be the perfect place for this discussion. 
The aim of the DC Accessibility IG is to work on Accessibility metadata - with the pay-off that will come from being part of one of the most effective standard movements...DC is starting to be everywhere. 
stay tuned! 
Liddy Liddy, I'm still trying to get DC to fix a problem with the language meta tag. 
HTML lang="en-US" is very redundant with the meta scheme="rfc1766" name ="DC.Language" content="en-us"/ Who in DC can help fix this? 
Authors, tools, and ATs are confused which to support.

Liddy This from the niso (DAISY talking book standard), a response to the submission. 
It is unclear what the rationale is for which elements have a lang attribute, which have an xml:lang attribute, and which have neither. 
(AQ: XML experts advised us that usage patterns for "xml:lang" and "lang" were still in flux but that "lang"would generally be most suitable for our application. 
We used "xml-lang" in the DTBSMIL DTD since the SMIL specification on which our DTD was based used it. 
As to which elements were assigned one of these attributes, that choice was made during the design of each DTD, based on input from our European and Asian contributors, who kept an eye on internationalization issues.) lang, xml:lang, how should they relate?

So I am not sure why it matters to tools that these things are redundant. 
If they don't know which is relevant to a particular instance (and in some environments that is already known) they can readily include both, based on an authoring interface that just asks for the language (and doesn't require the author to know which particular encodings are being used anyway). 
chaals Liddy, I'm still trying to get DC to fix a problem with the language meta tag.

Before asking all the tool vendors to support yet another standard, perhaps w3c, DC, etc standards folks could get their redundancies removed?

What about asking Tom Baker to come in on this conversation? 
Tom is a v good DC metadata and internationalisation and multilinguality person ... 
I'm chasing his email address.... Liddy Hmm. 
This isn't the forum to ensure that happens, but my personal perspective on this is that it is unlikely to happen. 
HTML/XML and Dublin Core are used primarily in different ways. 
There are some overlaps, because there are some features that are useful in both situations. 
But generally developers say things like "why should I have to parse Dublin Core information in RDF when I am really only trying to find the language of the document that my XML browser is presenting?", or "having to look inside a document for one piece of metadata tat I need for cataloguing, and build a seperate parser to do so, is precisely what we wanted to avoid by using Dublin Core". 
If you are suggesting that IBM would generally prefer to have the ability to parse both types of information, or that this is what you recommend to them, and believe that you could get some reasonable level of industry buy-in, then I would suggest going with the metadata solution as the preferred one. 
However, I think that is unlikely, and that in order to support the different use cases without requiring everyone to build massive pieces of software it is more useful to produce the two redundant forms. 
Just to illustrate, let me take an example where things are much closer together already. 
In EARL, each statement (or grop of statements) must include the date of the statement. 
If EARL is stored as an annotea annotation, then part of the informationthat the annotea system includes is a date. 
Both pieces of information are RDF, of type Date. 
It is an open question whether to make earl:date a type of dc:date or not - many implementors do not want to have to import the entire dublin core namespace as that requires extra features on their parsers. 
(Here, I think that people will settle for opening the namespace - particularly if we harmonise the work on DC.accessibility and earl soon enough...) just my 2c worth. 
chaals of course they "could", but they currently don't.

xml:lang is predefined for all xml languages. 
So normally if you want to do something to have an attribute that describes the natural language content of its host element, xml:lang would be the smart way to go.

With xml:lang as a more 'standard' way of specifying which language is in use?
