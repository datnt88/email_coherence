<s> That was quick :) Thanks to anyone who helped out in clearing the request, I'm now setting up  </s>
<s> the details.  </s>
<s> I'll add all who were added by Curt earlier on the DOM Conformance project,  </s>
<s> except if anyone strongly disagrees.  </s>
<s> Also, I'll give myself, Mary and Curt administrative rights.  </s>
<s> I'll be the one who takes questions and tests to the DOM WG for clarification, but I'd like to have more people aboard since we all can contribute to this.  </s>
<s> If anyone else feels like being a member of the DOM Conformance moderator group, please say so.  </s>
<s> How har would it be to get all tests submitted to the www-dom-ts-submission@w3.org to appear in the domconftest project?  </s>
<s> Something  </s>
<s> the W3C system team could look into?  </s>
<s> /Dimitris  </s>
<s> Sure, I'll help -- I should have the rest of the fundamental and extended tests ready by tomorrow.  </s>
<s> After the core tests work,  </s>
<s> we'll have to add metadata info -- but I think I can write a transform to put our original work into the rdf framework -- is this what we want to do?  </s>
<s> How do we  </s>
<s> envision the metadata info being used?  </s>
<s> Can  </s>
<s> we write a transform that will allow it to be displayed in a web browser, or will we have to transform off-line and make a html version available?  </s>

<s> up  </s>
<s> project,  </s>
<s> Something  </s>
<s> I guess we should spend some time on what the CVS should look like since  </s>
<s> it is impossible to undo changes without leaving a trace.  </s>
<s> We could put all submissions into a submissions module with subprojects for the contributors submissions submissions/nist submissions/nist/dom1 submissions/microsoft submissions/carnold The files in this module would be a verbatim copy of what was submitted and would not be modified.  </s>
<s> For the active project:  </s>
<s> domconftest tests java org w3c dom testing ecmascript adapters junit  </s>
<s> The structure below tests would mimic the organization used by NIST in their submission below the tests project.  </s>
<s> For example, domconftest/test/dom1/fundamental/attribute/attributeName.xml, etc. domconftest/java/org/w3c/dom/testing would only contain the interface and abstract class definitions.  </s>
<s> Actual tests would be in the same namespace but generated in the build/java/org/w3c/dom/testing.  </s>
<s> domconftest would contain an ANT build file and the transforms.  </s>
<s> domconftest/adapters could contain source for adapters, code that allows domconftest.jar  </s>
<s> to run in a specific test harness like JUnit.  </s>
<s> Probably need to get an official decision about w3c package names we can use.  </s>
<s> I've been temporarily using org.w3c.dom.testing.  </s>
<s> If the described structure seems appropriate, then it would be beneficial if you could import your tests into the submissions/nist and domconftest/tests directories.  </s>
<s> Not quite sure what you are starting from.  </s>
<s> I thought the test matrix was almost a manual affair.  </s>
<s> Since building a test matrix would require crawling all the available tests, I think generating it is part of the build process.  </s>
<s> You could capture the entire matrix in RDF by appending descriptions of the tests to the subjects.rdf  </s>
<s> file and using a browser side transform.  </s>
<s> However that seems overkill at this time and generating an HTML test matrix as part of the build seems reasonable.  </s>
<s> I did spend some time writing an Ant build file, but was running into a problem with either Ant or Xalan using the wrong base for resolving external entity references causing schema generation to fail.  </s>
<s> Not impossible, but difficult, tedious, and highly undesirable.  </s>
<s> ;)  </s>
<s> Where do you envison documentation would go?  </s>
<s> (Schema documentation, test framework documentation, etc.)  </s>
<s> Also, this seems somewhat Java-centric.  </s>
<s> Perhaps adapters/ should be inside the java/ directory, and then other languages would have a directory parallel to that?  </s>
<s> Where do you expect things like the Python and ECMAScript components to go?  </s>
<s> I'd at least expect the ECMAScript tests to be part of this repository since it plays an important role in the W3C specifications for the DOM.  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations  </s>
<s> My primary interest in getting the SourceForge project going was getting the tests, transforms and supporting resources in a common CVS, so we could automate the transform/compile/run cycle and  </s>
<s> collaborate on fixing either the tests or the transforms.  </s>
<s> The initial hurdles for test correctness are schema/DTD validity and whether the generated code successfully compiles.  </s>
<s> If the tests and the transforms are all in one CVS, then it should be fairly simple to automate the process and iteratively fix problems.  </s>
<s> Having the tests and transforms in distinct locations definitely complicates matters, especially since both are evolving.  </s>
<s> I would think that most of these would be generated, like the schemas and the generated source code, and would not appear in the CVS.  </s>
<s> I did have ecmascript is my tree, but it was less noticable since it didn't have, and didn't need, the deep hierarchy that the java node did.  </s>
<s> I guess it should have been capitalized differently.  </s>
<s> I would expect eventually there would be CLR, Python, and other siblings to the java and ecmascript directories.  </s>
<s> Will probably have a better idea on what it needed to adapt the generic tests to specific frameworks once we have built the generic tests.  </s>
<s> I was trying to represent these by the adapters project.  </s>
<s> However, wouldn't actually try to create that part of the tree until we had something to put in there.  </s>
<s> since  </s>
<s> [mb] Absolutely!  </s>
<s> I agree that components for a particular binding should be closely linked, and of course, documentation needs a prominent home - somewhere close to the top.  </s>
<s> --Mary  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how the documentation could be generated, but we can add it at an appropriate time if needed.  </s>
<s> OK, I see it now; no need to capitalize it differently.  </s>
<s> I should have been less hasty.  </s>
<s> Sounds good; these don't actually need to be added until there is content for them.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> We just need a basic idea of where they should go.  </s>
<s> It's not entirely clear to me that there must be both "generic" and "framework-based" tests.  </s>
<s> For Python, it's certainly not clear that we need both, since PyUnit became part of Python's standard library as of Python 2.1 (released last April); it can simply be supplied for older versions of Python, or we can recommend that it be installed first, with a link to the PyUnit site.  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations  </s>
<s> [mb] During a previous interation of the xml-ized dom tests, we had metadata info with each test, so these are already defined on a per test basis.  </s>
<s> It should be straightforward to transform them into the rdf tagset, and merge the metadata with the updated xml (according to Curt's schema) definitions.  </s>
<s> So, I should look at subjects.rdf for this???  </s>
<s> subjects.rdf (probably the last one as subjects.xml)  </s>
<s> should give you standard URI's for a good subset of the spec.  </s>
<s> However, it would be a manual process of searching for an appropriate text string and then finding the nearby URI.  </s>
<s> That could get very annoying if you have to do it often.  </s>
<s> I was thinking it might be possible to build a stylesheet that would transform this to HTML and to have a script that would copy the URI to the clipboard when you clicked it.  </s>
<s> That way you could find the appropriate section in the HTML, click the URI and then paste into the test.  </s>
<s> Might be good to see examples of what your current metadata looks like.  </s>
<s> [mb] Not sure I am following this conversation.  </s>
<s> What do you want to have automatically generated?  </s>
<s> Almost anything that we have written transform for.  </s>
<s> The full ANT build process for DOM Level 1 would do something like: Download DOM.zip from the W3C site Unzip DOM.zip Unzip xml-sources.zip  </s>
<s> Patch wd-dom.xml to add missing xmlns:xlink attribute Apply dom-to-xsd.xsl to generate schema Fixup _xmlns in schema Apply dom-to-dtd.xsl to generate DTD (doesn't exist right now) Apply extract.xsl to generate interface definitions Apply subjects.xsl  </s>
<s> to generate RDF descriptions of potential test subjects Apply test-to-java.xsl  </s>
<s> to all known tests to generate Java code Compile all generated Java code Build .jar  </s>
<s> file Build documentation The same process should also be repeatable for DOM Level 2, 3 and so on.  </s>
<s> I got as far as "Apply dom-to-xsd.xsl"  </s>
<s> before running into the Xalan or Ant bug that I described.  </s>
<s> The generated list isn't exhaustive and you can definitely identify other passages by an XPointer syntax.  </s>
<s> The generated list just provides a list of systematically generated URI's for the most obvious targets.  </s>
<s> The other thread was regarding pulling the tests together into a particular test suite.  </s>
<s> There are a couple of things that we need to decide on here -- if we suppose that we have a list of test purposes, with links to xml-ized tests, and we know where the transformation resides, it should be straightforward to generate a test suite.  </s>
<s> I haven't used Ant, so I'm not sure that I could help with this approach -- but I would think that this could be accomplished in any number of ways.  </s>
<s> Deciding whether a particular test is blessed to appear in a suite is a editoral judgement.  </s>
<s> However, to qualify for consideration, a test should be schema/DTD valid, the generated code should compile successfully, and the results of benchmark processors against the test should be available.  </s>
<s> Even if a test was decided to be a "bad" test, you should still be able to run it.  </s>
<s> It just wouldn't run as part of a specific suite.  </s>
<s> It's probably fairly important that we decide whether we want to support just the Junit framework for Java, or do we want something more generic in addition to the framework.  </s>
<s> Can anyone think of any java implementations that will not run under the Junit framework?  </s>
<s> If not, I'm happy enough to go with it.  </s>
<s> In the current generated Java code, I've abstracted all the test framework dependency into the DOMTestFramework interface that is passed as an argument to the runTest method.  </s>
<s> The generated code has no dependency on any JUnit classes, however the DOMTestFramework methods bear a resemblence to methods in JUnit's TestCase.  </s>
<s> To run within JUnit, you would need an standard adapter class that would implement DOMTestFramework and call the runTest method of the generated class.  </s>
<s> A similar process would be needed for any other arbitrary test framework.  </s>
<s> The Batik project, for example, would want to run on an internal Apache test framework.  </s>
<s> They would create their own adapter class, but they could use the same .jar  </s>
<s> file as a JUnit based test.  </s>
<s> As far as ECMAScript goes, couldn't we get folks who have those implementations to propose a framework?  </s>
<s> I can spend some time on it -- but probably not until next week.  </s>
