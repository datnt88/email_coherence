<s> Alan, Part of the problem is that despite the medical community having reached some consensus on terminology, there is much less consensus in other communities interested in ontologies.  </s>
<s> Another problem, is that the Web community has developed its own terminology.  </s>
<s> Finding a terminology that makes everyone happy is unlikely.  </s>
<s> When we use "term," we refer to any element in the ontology's vocabulary.  </s>
<s> This includes class names and property names (elsewhere called relations or slots).  </s>
<s> Thus, we are using it in the same sense that Ontolingua uses non-logical symbol, but since this document is meant for a wider audience than the logical community, we chose to avoid that term.  </s>
<s> Since concepts traditionally only refer to classes, it would be inappropriate to use that as well.  </s>
<s> The use of "label" comes from RDF Schema, where it is a "human-readable version of a resource name."  </s>
<s> In this sense, it is more like the linguistic phrases you describe.  </s>
<s> RDF Schema even suggests that a "label" can be used with a "xml:lang" attribute to identify a language for the label, although there are some questions as to whether this really works the way it was intended.  </s>
<s> There is no requirement that a label be associated with a unique term.  </s>
<s> As you say, there is ambiguity in lexical representation, and due to polysemy, the same label may be used with different meanings.  </s>
<s> If someone wishes to use them in search, then they would have to provide a method for resolving the ambiguity.  </s>
<s> As for your suggestions about concept names and concept identifiers, I don't believe Web Ontologies can make the same distinction.  </s>
<s> Due to the distributed nature of the Web, I don't believe you could say that there is a single unique identifer for every concept.  </s>
<s> How could you enforce such a thing?  </s>
<s> Instead every term (our usage) has a URI.  </s>
<s> Some of these URIs may refer to the same concept.  </s>
<s> In this case, an equivalence can be established between these URIs (see the class and property equivalence requirement), achieving the same effect as having multiple concept names for the same identifier.  </s>
<s> I do agree with you that there needs to be a distinction between the conceptual and the language layer, and will encourage the working group to examine the references you mention when it focuses on the problem of internationalization.  </s>
<s> Your comments also suggest that the requirements document could do a better job of defining the terminology it uses.  </s>
<s> Although we may not use the terminology you recommend, this would at least help you and others to translate it into your own terminology.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments.  </s>
