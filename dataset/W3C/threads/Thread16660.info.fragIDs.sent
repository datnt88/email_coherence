<s> Free sites aren't run for the consumers.  </s>
<s> There are browsers such as iCab, and Web-based proxy services available, that allow you to do quite sophisticated filtering.  </s>
<s> This can be used to get rid of most advertising (although you often need someone to maintain the filters on an ongoing basis, so there is a cost to be carried somewhere), especially banner ads and the like, although it isn't perfect.  </s>
<s> And many sites that use advertising would not exist without it, so they have a strong interest in making sure that you see it.  </s>
