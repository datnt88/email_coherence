<s> Part of this is my fault, for writing something that wasn't as precise as it should have been.  </s>
<s> Most of the confusion is on the part of people who do not distinguish between "what a CGI script should send" and "what a cache should do when a CGI script doesn't send what it should have sent".  </s>
<s> OF COURSE, CGI-generated responses (and all other origin server  </s>
<s> responses, too) should include either an explicit "don't cache this" marking (e.g., "Cache-control: max-age=0") or an explicit expiration time.  </s>
<s> Of course, of course, of course.  </s>
<s> That wasn't the question.  </s>
<s> The question (which I stated too informally) was "what happens when the response is NOT clearly marked as to cachability?"  </s>
<s> This is a *different* question.  </s>
<s> Current practice seems to be split.  </s>
<s> Ari says that the CERN and Netscape proxies never cache a response without a Last-Modified header.  </s>
<s> (With HTTP/1.1, this rule would presumably change to "without either a Last-Modifed or Etag header.")  </s>
<s> However, the practice in the Squid world seems to be different.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I fully understand the Squid code, but the version I looked at seems to allow caching of a response without a Last-Modified header.  </s>
<s> I was tasked by the working group meeting last week to address the specific issue of CGI, not the larger issue of whether a response without Last-Modified should be cached.  </s>
<s> based on my belief that the HTTP/1.1 spec should not discourage caching unnecessarily (reflecting what Roy wrote earlier, that the Web "depends on accurate caching to reduce network costs"), I constructed my proposed Note to reflect the looser approach used by Squid.  </s>
<s> So let's take these issues separately.  </s>
<s> If someone wants to propose a specification change (or a new Note for the spec) that says "do not cache responses without a Last-Modified header", that's fine with me, although it would be a good idea to combine this proposal with evidence (from a real-life proxy) that this doesn't significantly reduce caching in today's Internet.  </s>
<s> Back to the CACHING-CGI issue.  </s>
<s> My original proposal was sloppy in that it didn't make a distinction between "cache and reuse without revalidation" or "cache but must revalidate".  </s>
<s> And I forgot to include "htbin" as being more or less equivalent to "cgi-bin" (and yes, there are still lots of htbin URLs in active use).  </s>
<s> Also, I violated the informal rule that Notes should not use terms like "SHOULD".  </s>
<s> Here's a revised version, to replace the second paragraph in section 13.9: Some HTTP/1.0 cache operators have found that it is dangerous to cache and reuse without revalidation responses to requests for URLs that include any of the strings "cgi-bin", "htbin", or "?", because applications have traditionally used these URLs in conjunction with operations with significant side effects for GET or HEAD methods.  </s>
<s> However, if such a response includes an explicit, future, expiration time, then this implies that the response may be cached and reused without revalidation until it expires.  </s>
<s> If such a response includes a Last-Modified or Etag header, this implies that the response may be reused after revalidation (or without revalidation if explicitly fresh).  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT assign a heuristic expiration time to a response for a URL that includes the strings "htbin", "cgi-bin", or "?" in its rel_path part.  </s>
<s> If such a response does not  </s>
<s> carry an explicit expiration time, it must be treated as if it expires immediately.  </s>
<s> This does two things: (1) it clarifies that a cache can indeed follow its usual caching with "?" and "cgi-bin" responses, if they are explicitly marked to allow caching, and (2) we tighten up the rules on assigning heuristic expiration times for such responses, because of the known risks of this specific situation.  </s>

<s> I'm pretty sure I said this before, but I don't know what list.  </s>
<s> I am completely opposed to this change.  </s>
<s> It is inaccurate to say that caching and reusing such responses is "dangerous".  </s>
<s> The *only* reason *some* caches do not provide heuristic caching of such responses is because the presence of query-based parameters make it unlikely to get a second "hit" on the cache, and because the the absence of a Last-Modified (and now Etag) makes it impossible to do an efficient update.  </s>
<s> In any case, this is an optimization which is dependent on the context and number of users of the cache, and not a requirement of the protocol.  </s>
<s> The protocol already provides mechanisms for marking a response as non-cachable.  </s>
<s> All other responses to a GET request are cachable.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> I can't speak for the motivation of old cache authors, but I can speak as an HTTP/1.0 application author from before any RFCs when one had to reverse engineer everything and the empirical behavior I observed was that GET requests which included a query part were not cached.  </s>
<s> I support the behavior for handling HTTP/1.1 responses strictly conforming to Roy's position but I believe somthing like Jeff's proposed wording is necessary when the 1.1 cache is covering a 1.0 server.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> I support the behavior for handling HTTP/1.1 responses strictly conforming to Roy's position but I believe somthing like Jeff's proposed wording is necessary when the 1.1 cache is covering a 1.0 server.  </s>
<s> I would go along with this, except that I see no way that a proxy in a chain of several proxies can reliably determine whether the origin server is HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> E.g., if you have this configuration: Origin_server----Proxy_p1-----Proxy_p2------client how does Proxy_p2 know for sure that the Origin_server is not HTTP/1.0?  </s>
<s> Given that, there certainly are many cases where a proxy can reliably know that the origin server is definitely HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> For example, Proxy_p1 knows that it's talking to the origin server, and it knows what HTTP-version is sent in the response status-line.  </s>
<s> Or, if the response includes a header that could only have been added by an HTTP/1.1 server (e.g., Cache-Control).  </s>
<s> So, one possible rewording of the proposed resolution would be to change:  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT assign a heuristic expiration time to a response for a URL that includes the strings "htbin", "cgi-bin", or "?" in its rel_path part.  </s>
<s> If such a response does not  </s>
<s> carry an explicit expiration time, it must be treated as if it expires immediately.  </s>
<s> to this:  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT assign a heuristic expiration time to a response for a URL that includes the strings "htbin", "cgi-bin", or "?" in its rel_path part, if the response might have been generated by an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier) origin server.  </s>
<s> If such a response does not carry an explicit expiration time,  </s>

<s> Like Roy, I am opposed to the wording:  </s>
<s> The strongest wording I would support here would be `A cache should [lowercase!] be careful in assigning ...'.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> Don't panic, I'm not marking it closed.  </s>
<s> That is why I sent it to the list, in case there were issues that had not been aired due to the mishandling of the issue.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> In most cases, yes, but the relevant question is why they are not cached.  </s>
<s> The reason given by all of the cache maintainers I talked to at the Geneva, Chicago, Boston, Paris, and Santa Clara WWW conferences is that attempts to cache those responses led to poor hit frequency on the cache.  </s>
<s> In other words, it is a performance optimization and does not need to be written into the protocol.  </s>
<s> Why? Why is it "necessary" to force a cachable response to be non-cachable?  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 had its own mechanisms for indicating cachability, and the presence or absence of "?" or "cgi-bin" or "htbin" does not indicate anything.  </s>
<s> It is a fundamentally bad idea to associate any URL pattern with a particular HTTP functionality, because it breaks the separation between those two protocols.  </s>
