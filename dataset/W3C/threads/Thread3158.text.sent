This is a strawman proposal for addition to the SKOS-Core schema: Some thesauri group concepts into ordered arrays, and label the array, e.g. People Children (0-12 years) Teenagers (13-19 years) Adults (over 20 years) Since this sort of thing is common practise, and I believe will be a part of the new British standard for thesauri (Leonard, Stella?), 
I thought we ought to come up with a mechanism for representing it as part of the SKOS-Core vocab. 
This sort of thing would also be useful in the Annotea bookmarks work. 
The problem is the best way to represent an ordered list in RDF. 
The consensus so far seems to be for using RDF Lists (collections). 
The other problem is how to connect an array to the parent concept. 
Such a connection cannot replace the skos:broader statements from the array members, and must be synchronised with them. 
Anyway, I suggest the following additions: skos:Arrayardfs:Class. 
skos:arrayMemberListardf:Property; rdfs:domainskos:Array. 
skos:arrayParentardf:Property; rdfs:domainskos:Array; rdfs:rangeskos:Concept. 
... which would lead to e.g. ... [askos:Array; rdfs:label'people by age'; skos:arrayParent:conceptD; skos:arrayMemberList(:conceptA :conceptB :conceptC) :conceptDaskos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'People'; skos:narrower:conceptA; skos:narrower:conceptB; skos:narrower:conceptC. 
:conceptAaskos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Children (0-12 years)'; skos:broader:conceptD. 
:conceptBaskos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Teenagers (13-19 years)'; skos:broader:conceptD. 
:conceptCaskos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Adults (over 20 years)'; skos:broader:conceptD. 
Comments on any aspect of this suggestion?

I disagree that this would be a significant expansion of the project. 
We have started to do some preliminary mapping of AAT, LCSH, MeSH, DDC, etc. and for the most part they seem to map into the SKOS model. 
Areas where we are currently having problems with are notes and node labels. 
For notes, I think the problem is easily fixed. 
In SKOS, everything is a skos:scopeNote. 
That doesn't fit well with the vocabularies we are working with. 
OK, in a pinch it works. 
We would prefer that SKOS take the same tack that TIF (Thesaurus Interchange Format) took. 
There is a Note class and scopeNote is a subclass of Note. 
When you have note types that aren't of scope type, you can subclass Note. 
Right now, everything has to be sub classed from skos:scopeNote. 
That just doesn't feel right and causes some problems with Dewey that has between 10 to 20 different note types and they aren't all scope notes. 
As I said previously, we could shoe horn them into skos:scopeNote, but that's not ideal because we loose the subtle distinctions that the Dewey editors went to the trouble to make. 
Of course, this discussion on node labels, is another area that is causing us problems. 
I'm far from an expert on AAT but have noted the "guide terms" and the fact that these "guide terms" can directly have "guide terms" underneath them. 
Dewey also has this same concept in the form of centered entries, which can be considered node labels. 
The centered entries can directly have centered entries underneath them. 
Also, in Dewey and as someone else pointed out with AAT these "node labels" do have NT/BT relationships. 
While in a "normal" thesaurus they have only a grouping relationship. 
For Dewey, we need to maintain those NT/BT relationships and I suspect we would need to do the same for AAT. 
The current proposal doesn't take this into account and I really would hate to have two different methods to deal with the differing strategies. 
I think, with a little effort that both and possible other "node label" strategies could be accommodated. 
After rereading what I wrote here, maybe what is needed is to separate the relationship information, e.g. NT/BT vs. grouping. 
Also, I think Stella Dextre Clarke mentioned the ordering problem, e.g. you say that it's ordered alphabetically -- what doesn't that mean for different languages? 
I think the ordering problem could be easily handled by attaching audience, e.g. xml:lang, to the node label array. 
Thus you could specify the same node label array with the elements in differing order based upon your audience.

I disagree that this would be a significant expansion of the project.

Areas where we are currently having problems with are notes and node labels. 
1. Yes, notes should certainly be dealt with as you suggest, by having a main class of "notes" and subclasses for different kinds of notes. 
This would avoid a field labelled "scope notes" having to accommodate notes of other kinds. 
2. As regards node labels, I have tried to show that we need to distinguish between (a) real "node labels", which specify a characteristic of division in the form xxx by yyy and (b) broader concepts which act as parent terms to the terms in a following array. 
DDC centred headings and some of the AAT guide terms fall under (b), and should not be called node labels. 
Structurally these are just terms representing concepts which the thesaurus editor has decided are unsuitable for use in indexing (and may have to be labelled in some way to indicate this). 
3. The more complex issue that I thought would broaden the scope of the project is handling pre-coordinated indexing strings. 
The problem is described in the following extract from "FAST : development of simplified headings for metadata / by Rebecca J. Dean" "LCSH is not a true thesaurus in the sense that it is not a comprehensive list of all valid subject headings. 
Rather LCSH combines authorities, now five volumes in their printed form, with a four-volume manual of rules detailing the requirements for creating headings that are not established in the authority file and for the further subdivision of the established headings. 
The rules for using free-floating subdivisions controlled by pattern headings illustrate some of these complexities. 
Under specified conditions, these free-floating subdivisions can be added to established headings. 
The scope of patterns is limited to particular types (patterns) of headings. 
For example, Burns and scalds-Patients-Family relationships is a valid heading formed by adding two pattern subdivisions to the established heading Burns and scalds. 
The subdivision 'Patients' is one of several hundred subdivisions that can be used with headings for diseases and other medical conditions. 
Therefore it can be used to subdivide Burns and scalds. 
However, the addition of Patients changes the meaning of the heading from a medical condition to a class of persons. 
Now, since Family relationships is authorized under the pattern for classes of persons, it can also be added to complete the heading." 
DDC and MeSH, similarly, have many provisions for synthesising concepts to express compound concepts that may or may not be enumerated in the schedules. 
A classification schedule may show these compound concepts in a hierarchical display, as I illustrated in the second example in my message of 6th May, but the hierarchy is not built on the same BT/NT relationships as in a thesaurus. 
It seems to me to be a much more complex job for SKOS to try to create a system that would incorporate rules for creating these compound strings. 
Most of them don't exist until they are needed for indexing a document, though once they are created they may be stored in an authority file so that the same string will be used if the same compound topic arises again in future. 
The FAST project http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/fast/ from which I quoted above recognises this problem by treating each of the elements of an LCSH heading separately and grouping them into subject, time, place, form, people and organisations facets. 
This makes it much more amenable to storing in a structure like SKOS, and seems the best initial approach.
