<s> I agree that nobody is trying suggesting that we try and solve the semantics of common version labeling requirements.  </s>
<s> That was a flippant comment, sorry.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I believe it is a reasonable expectation on the part of the user that if they declare a label in the English language (and indicate as much with an attribute on that label),  </s>
<s> hold on, that is what I said -- that we don't describe the label as a language attributed value, it is just a string, a sequence of characters with a well defined encoding scheme.  </s>
<s> that this definition be respected, and that a request for that label not come back with some non-English byte string that happens to match.  </s>
<s> Similarly, any other attribute declared on that label should be respected.  </s>
<s> I think you are very brave to go down this road, and I predict it will end in tears.  </s>
<s> Are you are seriously suggesting that you will match based on language rules?  </s>
<s> Maybe just language name?  </s>
<s> It is unneccessary and I suggest beyond VCM expectations.  </s>
<s> So unless we define an "XML attribute encoding" syntax for the Label header (which I strongly advocate we not do), the Label header will be missing key information needed for a correct label match to be performed.  </s>
<s> I agree we do not want any attributes.  </s>
<s> I still want the Label: header.  </s>

<s> I see no reason to believe that a label is anything other than a sequence of characters (in some specified encoding).  </s>
<s> I do not see that language has any relevance to the topic.  </s>
<s> Let's please keep the Label: header.  </s>

<s> A label is a human-readable string.  </s>
<s> To correctly display an arbitrary sequence of Unicode characters, a computer must know the language of the string.  </s>
<s> This allows the computer to, for example, draw the characters left to right, or right to left, as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Thus the language tag is necessary.  </s>
<s> However, this is all predicated on the label being just a single string.  </s>
<s> What if label is changed into the pair: (label_id, label_displayname) Comparisons could be performed against the label_id (which is a computer-generated ID), and the label displayname could be shown to the user.  </s>
<s> This would keep the human readability, while avoiding the i18n string comparison problems.  </s>
<s> Header marshalling would be ugly, but feasible.  </s>
