I agree that nobody is trying suggesting that we try and solve the semantics of common version labeling requirements. 
That was a flippant comment, sorry. 
On the other hand, I believe it is a reasonable expectation on the part of the user that if they declare a label in the English language (and indicate as much with an attribute on that label), 
hold on, that is what I said -- that we don't describe the label as a language attributed value, it is just a string, a sequence of characters with a well defined encoding scheme. 
that this definition be respected, and that a request for that label not come back with some non-English byte string that happens to match. 
Similarly, any other attribute declared on that label should be respected. 
I think you are very brave to go down this road, and I predict it will end in tears. 
Are you are seriously suggesting that you will match based on language rules? 
Maybe just language name? 
It is unneccessary and I suggest beyond VCM expectations. 
So unless we define an "XML attribute encoding" syntax for the Label header (which I strongly advocate we not do), the Label header will be missing key information needed for a correct label match to be performed. 
I agree we do not want any attributes. 
I still want the Label: header.

I believe my position matches Tim's precisely. 
I see no reason to believe that a label is anything other than a sequence of characters (in some specified encoding). 
I do not see that language has any relevance to the topic. 
Let's please keep the Label: header.

A label is a human-readable string. 
To correctly display an arbitrary sequence of Unicode characters, a computer must know the language of the string. 
This allows the computer to, for example, draw the characters left to right, or right to left, as appropriate. 
Thus the language tag is necessary. 
However, this is all predicated on the label being just a single string. 
What if label is changed into the pair: (label_id, label_displayname) Comparisons could be performed against the label_id (which is a computer-generated ID), and the label displayname could be shown to the user. 
This would keep the human readability, while avoiding the i18n string comparison problems. 
Header marshalling would be ugly, but feasible.
