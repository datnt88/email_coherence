but the server must return a 403 or 404 status for the broken URL, Some reason the server cannot return a page with page not found information? 
Returning anything except an error response breaks link checking software. 
What does link checking software have to do with user accessibility? 
Kurt Mattes Application Development Analyst-Lead Developer (302) 282-1414 Kurt_Mattes@bankone.com otherwise), that would leave little room for elegant broken link *** handling or so-called marketing Broken links should not be handled by client mediated redirects. 
It is OK to redirect as a purely internal operation on the server, but the server must return a 403 or 404 status for the broken URL, not, as often happens, a 302 to a 200 for the link is broken page. 
Returning anything except an error response breaks link checking software.

As the content of a 404 message. 
A semantic web - one where information can be semantically linked to other information across the web - appears to provide more accessibility than a collection of documents that can point to each other. 
This should be no surprise - we know that a document where individual pieces of information can be identified and described is generally more accessible than one which simply provides a presentation of a "whole document". 
Think about how flash and pdf accessibility work, or why HTML is generally preferred over un-marked-up plain text. 
Think about the ease of manipulating word documents that have style sheets, and the hassle if they just have formatting tags applied. 
(Hint: The strategy used for those that just have formatting is to work out search routines that assume each set of format rules is effectively a style rule). 
So what makes a semantic web work? 
One of the important things is that you can find information on the web - it doesn't move around randomly. 
Another is that documents respect the semantics inherent in HTML. 
If a tool thinks it is getting a real page back, it should try to treat it as a page. 
If it's getting a special instruction then it expects that to come according to the standards, so it can deal with it. 
For example, a WWAAC system to search the Web for symbols and illustrations to represent a page can also search for known simpler representations. 
If it goes to a page and is told the page isn't there with a 404 response, it can look to see if there is still a simpler version of that content around, and present it. 
If it gets a response saying you should try and second-guess the way that the system has organised their documents and mess around with the URI, as an ordinary page, it will try to present that information. 
For people like the clients of peepo, who probably only followed images to get to the site (hands up if you tried to read an arabic news site in the last year by following pictures?), this information is next to useless anyway. 
Whereas if the software finds nothing, it can present a "we don't know where this is anymore" that is appropriate for the user.

Quoting "Kurt_Mattes@bankone.com" Kurt_Mattes@bankone.com : A good 404 page has that information. 
A great 404 page helps you find a relevant page to whatever you were looking for when you followed the dead link. 
A 200 page that says "page not found" is a lie. 
410 is good too; indeed even better in those cases where it is applicable. 
I always thought "gets the basic functionality half-way right" was a prerequesite for accessibility. 
Also, ideally a site should be accessible to users that include automated processes. 
Jon Hanna *Thought provoking quote goes here* It should always do so, but as the payload of the 403 or 404. 
The HTTP standards say that there should be a fall back document associated with all rejection status reports. 
Most web servers should be able to do this if the fancy error page is referenced by a local URL, although I find it not uncommon for even such local URLs to be broken and produce a double fault. 
When things really break is when an absolute URL is used; in that case, the client has to mediate, and sees a redirect for the original URL, not an error, issues the redireted URL, which comes back as a success, so it looks like the original URL was a valid redirection, rather than a broken link. 
Cheap web hosters are likely to redirect to their branded error page, and therefore require an absolute URL, breaking the semantics.
