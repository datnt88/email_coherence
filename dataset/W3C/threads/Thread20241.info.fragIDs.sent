<s> Hi, That's right the multi-key is available only when there is an entry "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" in a configuration file.  </s>
<s> The file Amaya\config\win-thot.rc gives the default configuration for windows platforms and the file Amaya\users\$name\thot.rc gives the specific configuration for the user $name.  </s>
<s> The normal way to build your specific configuration file is to select your preferences in the menu Special- Preferences.  </s>
<s> For example "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" is set by clicking Special- Preferences- General- MultiKey Regards Irene.  </s>

<s> Jean Raymond, I need more context to help you.  </s>
<s> From where are you compiling Amaya?  </s>
<s> From the CVS base or from the source distribution?  </s>
<s> You should have a directory called libwww/modules/md5/ and that's where the md5 code is found.  </s>
<s> Can you tell me where are your trees?  </s>
<s> It should work if you have it as /somepath/libwww/ /somepath/Amaya/ /somepath/Amaya/obj and if you call configure inside the obj directory.  </s>
<s> Are you interested in testing message digest authentication?  </s>
<s> If yes, I made a bug fix this week on the main libwww branch, but I haven't yet committed it to the libwww Amaya tagged branch.  </s>
<s> I can do it if you need it.  </s>
<s> I didn't do it yet because I'm going to merge to the latest dev branch in a couple of weeks.  </s>
