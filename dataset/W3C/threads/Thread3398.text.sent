Just out of personal interest, does anyone know if any of the major newspapers are syndicating their news via an RSS feed?

One of the things he's looking at is aggregating and merging newsfeeds (well, the case study uses weather reports, but RSS has sufficient structure to make his fusion rules work, I think) to take into account inconsistency in the supplied data. 
The technique would really rely on "semantic" markup in RSS, though: that is, for instance, using RSS modules for weather, football reports, etc - or being able to parse the interesting bits out of free text.
