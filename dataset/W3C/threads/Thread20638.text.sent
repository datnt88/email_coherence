Sorry if this has been dealt with before, but I am having trouble building Amaya 4.2.1 from the source tarball. 
I created .../Amaya/solaris (this is on Solaris 2.7) and did "../configure --prefix=/devel/local" but it complained about not finding libwww sources. 
I retrieved w3c-libwww-5.3.2 and untarred it at the same level as Amaya and made a symlink to libwww. 
The configure then runs without error, but the "make all" blows up. 
It looks like after it completes the libpng it returns to the solaris directory and starts to rerun configure. 
It then complains "configure: error: source directory already configured; run make distclean there first" followed by "libwww is configured" then "/bin/sh: libwww/modules/md5: does not exist" Have I missed something obvious here?

Hi, I didn't understand if you downloaded the source tar file or the CVS version. 
The source tar file is complete and include libwww sources. 
Installation form CVS is explained in our page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs .html

Irene - This was from the source tar file, and I finally figured out what happened. 
After I unpacked the source, I started the ../configure, and at the same time I started deleting stuff from old versions of Amaya. 
I expected the libwww included with the source to be somewhere below the Amaya directory, not at the same level, so I deleted it thinking it was from an older version. 
I re-extracted, and everything configures and compiles fine. 
Thanks for the help, and sorry for my confusion.
