<s> Hello, I think the value of search is to be able to find something that is expected or remembered, when you don't know where it is.  </s>
<s> So I think that reverse serach (or "whole document") is fairly important.  </s>
<s> Since it is required that a user can establish where they are in a document, it should be possible to use that and the ability to do all searches from teh beginning to find out where things are relative to each other.  </s>
<s> SO I could live with Ian's minimal requirement, although I would prefer to have forward/reverse/whole document, or whole document plus knowing whether the find was behind or in front of the point of regard.  </s>

<s> I agree With Chals if the only thing in the min rec is search forward or it is not speeled out at least to bidirectional it doesn't help a lot. the reson for my stipulation of bidirectionality is that with whole document, if I understand it correctly, I'll find something I may have already found which may be what I want but if so I'd ask for revers search.  </s>
<s> this also may be an orientation issue.  </s>
