<s> What a nice concept!  </s>
<s> In a recent discussion on another list I'm on, someone offered the excuse that any inaccessible sites he'd designed were the fault of his cheap and short-sighted clients who refused to pay the extra cost necessary to make the site accessible.  </s>
<s> I countered by explaining Idyll Mountain Internet's philosophy -- web accessibility is a natural and integral part of doing a site, and not an optional add-on; in fact, we'd probably charge more if someone DEMANDED that we make the site INaccessible.  </s>

<s> Well, you're the customer.  </s>
<s> We'll charge $50 per image to remove alt text.")  </s>
<s> I think that if you say "and of course we'll make sure your page is accessible to as broad an audience as possible" a design client will buy that; if you say "well, for an extra cost, I can go to all the trouble of making sure that small percentage of people who are blind are able to access your site -- if you REALLY want me to," then it's no surprise that the cheaper, budget-conscious folks would resist.  </s>
<s> We have an education problem here -- we have to change the mindset of web designers who view accessibility as an optional plug-in and not an integral part of the process.  </s>

<s> Thank You Kynn! although I never charge for accessibility the idea of charging more not to never occurred to me.  </s>

<s> current Limitations on accessibility.  </s>
<s> 'Blind people' are not the only people having trouble accessing the web.  </s>
<s> Whilst I am keen to encourage members to improve accessibility, it is important to recognise that no site is fully accessible.  </s>
<s> Rules have exceptions, and we have not even formalised the 'rules' that concern cognitive disability.  </s>
<s> Let alone met their needs  </s>
<s> To claim that a site is accessible is an exaggeration.  </s>
<s> We are only beginning to touch on the possibilities.  </s>

<s> Since you're responding to me, I'm assuming this is addressed to me -- please note that the reference to "blind people" was a _HYPOTHETICAL ARGUMENT_ of the type advanced by ignorant web designers, not a statement of my beliefs.  </s>
<s> Thank you for restating something I've stated myself many times.  </s>
<s> Obviously it's important to remember this and keep in mind.  </s>
<s> When, exactly, do you plan to start?  </s>
<s> I'd like to see some progress on this -- it's been over a year since you made loud noises about this on the WAI mailing list, and I have yet to see anything from you personally, or anyone else who is an expert on this, that can be used constructively by web developers and web educators to improve awareness on this issue.  </s>
<s> I'd -love- to see some guidelines for doing this.  </s>
<s> I've tried myself -- and posted the URL here -- but this isn't my area of expertise.  </s>
<s> I'd like those of you who -are- experts in this area to PLEASE give us some concrete guidance -- and not glib, vague assertions -- so that we can actually get some work done toward this goal.  </s>
<s> As it stands, all I've seen can be summed up as "waaah, this isn't accessible to *our* special interest group, but no, we're *not* going to tell you how to make it so!" And that's very frustrating.  </s>
<s> I can only work with people who are willing to do some work themselves.  </s>
