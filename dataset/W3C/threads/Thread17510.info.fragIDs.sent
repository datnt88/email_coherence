<s> Ian Jacobs is an editor with considerable experience in developing W3C working drafts and recommendations, and he has made several excellent suggestions for improving the UA working draft.  </s>
<s> One of the overriding comments was that the document needed better background and definition information for referencing key terms and orienting users to the different sections of the guideline.  </s>
<s> The following is a new table of contents for the browser document: 1.0 Introduction 2.0 General Principles of accessible design 3.0 Assistive Technology 4.0 Parts of a Browser User Agent 5.0 Interaction with a document 6.0 CSS Support 7.0 Presentation 8.0 Orientation 9.0 Navigation 10.0 Visibility 11.0 Operating System Aceessibility Compatibility  </s>
<s> Ian is currently setting up the documents to better handle revising the document and tracking comments on issues that are rasied in the group.  </s>
<s> This will take a few days to setup.  </s>
<s> Anyone with any comments on the guidelines structure is urged to speak up now, since there will be some major changes in the dcoument over the next week.  </s>

<s> I think 2,3,4,5 (even though I don't know the exact content) could be folded into one background section, so that people that *knows* about this stuff can jump directly into the guideliens per se.  </s>
<s> I'd like 6.0 to be more "Format Support" or "Standard Support", something that would include more that just CSS, but also HTML, and maybe more later.  </s>
<s> I fact, it could include 11.0 and be a "Capability" section: support html4, css, local os stuff, etc.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> Yes, the latter sounds good.  </s>
<s> I brought up CSS explicitly because (1) there are some guidelines that only make sense for UAs that implement CSS; these guidelines should be grouped together (at least I think for the moment, although experience will determine whether this organization works).  </s>
<s> (2) there are concepts like "default values" that are well-defined in CSS (defaults cascade with author and user style sheets) and so a general term like "UA defaults" should be defined with the CSS meaning in mind, and should be consistent with it, even if the definition does not rely on the notion of style sheets.  </s>
