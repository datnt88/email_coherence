I think we have a winner: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/waicard10.htm 
Thanks Harvey for the HTML validity review, it now passes validator.w3.org and is also tidied-up. 
Regarding your comment The actual example waicards9snapshot.gif prints (2.4" x 4.2"), about 120% of the US business card (2" x 3.5"). 
It looks like the point size in the text of the *.gif is about 11 pt, so the scaling of the gif, up 20%, is consistent with 9 pt at the 2" x 3.5" card size. 
I assume the latter is your objective. 
Yes, the gif is just to show the layout, not the real size. 
It wasn't clear so I modified the sentence introducing the link. 
I have also attached a Color PostScript of the card, which is at real size (gives same size as the pilot when I print it). 
(the day we don't need a gif and ps but can only use CSS font-size and other positioning and printing properties to do that dual layout is going to be a great day) Judy, I incorporated most of your comments. 
3. Images &amp; Animations Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals. 
- I guess I missed something months ago, but I think this works better if we take out "the function of". 
"Function of" works OK for animations, but I took the em out on "function" but I insist we keep the word itself. 
It was discussed heavily on the GL list and people really want ALT to indicate which function the visual performs, not to indicate a description of the visual (see my examples to Alan: "search" instead of "little magniflyer glass"). 
For purely decorative graphics, the function is nil and ALT="", which is different than no ALT - which is invalid). 
6. Hypertext Links Use text that makes sense when read out of context. 
No "Click here". 
- there is room to substitute 'Do not use "click here"' so I think we should substitute that, to keep the phrasing flow consistent. 
My intent with No "Click here" was to convey some kind of genericity, as in 'No "click here" kinda stuff please' I now have Hypertext Links: Use text that makes sense when read out of context. 
Do not use "click here" for instance. 
Daniel: Before you call it "final" can I suggest that you have a copy editor look review it for writing style? 
The content looks fine, but I think there are a couple editorial type issues. 
For example: 1. 
Each term should be set off from the term's definition. 
Use a period or colon. 
2. For Hypertext Links, reword second statement to: "For example, do not use "click here". 
(not sure whether the period goes inside the quotes or outside in this situation. 
Check with an editor. 
3. For Multimedia, I think you can remove the comma after "descriptions of video". 
I'm pretty sure you can replace the words, "in case" with the word "when". 
4. For Page Organization, I think you can remove the comma after "lists" 5. For Check your work, the statement is not quite clear. 
Change to either, "Use evaluation tools and a text only browser to verify accessibility." or "Use evaluation tools and text only browsers to verify accessibility". 
Sorry for last minute input.

"Function of" works OK for animations, but OK fine. 
Need to flip sentence order: For instance do not use "click here." 
For consistency with regard to conciseness, Do not use "click here." 
"sites" is missing from heading ("Web sites") Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) International Program Office World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE43-355, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA 3. For Multimedia, I think you can remove the comma after "descriptions of video". 
I'm pretty sure you can replace the words, "in case" with the word "when". 
I don't think so. 
Although you could probably remove the whole rationale and simply explain what has to be done. 
Charles McCathieNevile I'm not sure about that, the font change might be enough. 
Other opinion ? 
Maybe it's for the graphic designer to decide... Changed. 
We just changed it from "when" in "in case". 
See Judy's comments. 
I'm not sure what's the rule for comma before and in english. 
In French, it's not used. 
done Writers often use the comma to separate lists of items. 
However, it's not necessary to use that comma for the last list item preceding the connective (in this case, "and"). 
Functionally, the comma and the connective (and) do the same thing. 
But, I won't quibble over style.

Sorry, I was a bit unclear. 
It is not the comma I have a quibble with, it is the use of 'when' instead of 'in case'.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA For someone who has expressed an interest in "freezing" this card I just had a (perhaps absurd?) mild reservation on looking at the finished item: the word "complete" is both adjective and verb and for some reason it struck me funny at 5 AM. 
At first I thought "just leave it out" because *of course* the linked-to guidelines must be *complete* or we wouldn't use them as reference; and of course we aren't asking the reader of the card to *finish* them! 
If we must modify "guidelines" perhaps "full" will do. 
I dunno but on balance I still vote to cast the plates and print on. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I'd like to hear from others. 
The bold font only says "this word is important". 
It does not set it off as a term. 
What you have is a Def list. 
Something needs to set those terms off from their definitions. 
If you used a table, it would be space. 
In a compact use like you have on the card, it should be a period, colon or dash. 
(That;s it for me. 
I won't argue the point anymore). 
I appreciate Judy's comments. 
Thanks for pointing them out. 
I missed them earlier. 
The problem with the phrase "in case" is that it's not an international phrase. 
I see it as "dead wood" (talk about non-international phrases). 
What you're saying when you use the phrase, "in case" is "just in case you forgot"; or, "just in case you overlooked". 
The idea of the card is to deliver statements that people can immediately react to. 
Keep it simple and straighforward. 
While it's true that the statement isn't based on a 100% ratio, most people understand the implication. 
Okay, I'm done for the day. 
Time to get back to my own writing. 
:-) - Mike Nashua, NH 03060???????????? WWW: http://www.webable.com 
Somehow, I don't like Full guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI maybe because "full of" something is often used in derogative ways. 
How about For the complete guidelines: www.w3.org/WAI 
I agree, I tried with periods and it looks nicer. 
I'm leaving "in case" for now, we'll see how IG and GL react. 
Copy edit: I'd eliminate initial caps on tip topics after the first. 
i.e., use style of the last tip. 
Regards/Harvey Yep we will. 
Hmmm. 
Colon, if we must. 
I'll check on this. 
Inside is generally more accepted; outside has become standard as well for some formats. 
I'll check as well.
