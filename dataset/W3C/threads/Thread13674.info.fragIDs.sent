<s> We now have a new accessibility evaluation tool ready for testing.  </s>

<s> It also does all the regular HTML Tidy checks and if you're a user of HTML Tidy then you can replace your Tidy with  </s>

<s> This is an early beta version and we're looking for feedback and users willing to test the software.  </s>
<s> You can download it from: http://snow.utoronto.ca/chris/AccTidy.html  </s>
<s> This version has been compiled for Windows but we will make the source code  </s>

<s> is there an online version of this tidy (or the original for that matters)?  </s>
<s> a simple form that asks for a url or upload return the result of tidy stdout + a link to the new source (or put it in a separate frame that can be saved from the browser).  </s>
<s> No, there is not an online version of this tool.  </s>
<s> It's designed to be run on your host system but could be modified to run on a server.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion.  </s>

<s> Hi Chris, have you added tis stuff to the sourceforge tidy project (it got moveed there  </s>

<s> We haven't added it to the Sourceforge project yet but plan on doing so.  </s>
<s> We plan on making the source code available under their public license.  </s>
<s> I wanted to get some feedback on the usefulness of our program before merging it with their code base.  </s>
<s> All our accessibility code is in a separate file but there are a few small changes that need to be made to the Tidy code.  </s>
<s> So there will be a small impact in adding our code to theirs.  </s>

<s> It would be nice to have all the AERT evaluations published as some formal manipulation of a page's DOM (as we had been talking about the other day on the phone).  </s>
<s> This would give us a specific description of each algorithm and, whatever the implementation (XSL, C++ or Java-based DOMs), such a description could then be quickly moved from the AERT into evaluation tools.  </s>
