I agree with Jon/Liora etc. on naming this thing XML-Link. 
Hyper-X sounded good at the time but I now see the wisdom of XML-Link. 
As for slogans, how about:- "XML: Call a spade a spade " Regards, Sean Mc Grath digitome@iol.ie 
Another slogan: "Go there, do that, design the t-shirt" /s/ kwc 2/11/97 02:29 Sean, that is truly inspired! 
Fantastic! 
General point: Any slogans should emphasise the advantage of XML vis-?-vis HTML, *not* vis-?-vis 
SGML. 
That is: It's about the good stuff that SGML is bringing to the web, not about the bad stuff (and lots of good stuff) that's getting thrown out of SGML. 
So I don't like Peter's "Practise Safe SGML".
