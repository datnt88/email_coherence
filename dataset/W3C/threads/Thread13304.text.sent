I think we should very well explain to the public why these guys are wrong: To make a long story short, they claim that real validators are bad because they find errors that other "validators" let them get away with. 
They say its bad because "both" Netscape and explorer "support" these errors (invalid nestings, not escaped ampresands in URLs, unquoted attributes etc.). 
The bottom line is that they recommend using mediocre checkers and not to use validators. 
Regards, Nir Dagan, Ph.D. "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein Yes, it's true that the validator shouldn't be criticized for being "overly strict", but there's another point they also make, that the error messages are cryptic: When tag attributes aren't surrounded by quotes, W3C reports "An attribute value must be a literal unless it contains only name characters." Ampersands in URLs (technically a no-no, though quite common) are met with cryptic "General entity not defined" reports. 
Len Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA In regard to Len's comment, it is true that they [1] have one reasonable remark, but all their other remarks indicate that they are HTML ignorant.

Len" There are two thing here. 
1. Messages are unclear. 
Check the WDG validator [1], it gives better message for both missing quotes and undefined entities. 
It uses nsgmls like W3C and WebTechs. 
So these two features (strictness and lack of clarity) are logically indepent. 
A possible next step for WAI / W3C is to compose friendly messages and allow the user to choose between nsmgls messages and friendly one's. 
2. They claim that it is technically invalid (a no-no) to write ampersands in URLs but there is no choice (quite common), and they congratulate WebTechs for allowing this (in a sentence that Len didn't quote). 
This is wrong. 
ampersands in URLs are allowed but they must be escaped. 
Escaped ampersands in attribute values including URLs are widely supported by browsers. 
The behavior of webtechs that allows authors to get away with errors is criticized by many including Liam Quinn and Alan Flavell. 
(I appologize for not giving reference) They also complain that the validator errs when it flags an error "element P not allowed here" where here is as a child of TABLE. 
This error in the HTML actually exists on the very page of the survey [2] They should actually criticize the other "validators" for not finding this serious syntax error.
