<s> Guideline 2.5 says "Help users avoid mistakes and make it easy to correct them".  </s>
<s> I would like to add another success criteria.  </s>
<s> Some forms require you to start over again if you make a mistake, because the information you filled in is missing.  </s>
<s> Especially for people with limited motor functions or other disabilities that slow their navigation in forms, filling out a form can be very time consuming anyway.  </s>
<s> I think we should add a success criterion to 2.5 to say that where possible you should keep the correct content and only require the user to correct the mistakes.  </s>
<s> Since this tells authors how to create their content, it would have to be a level 2. Proposal: Lvl 2 Success criterion: If a user error is detected in a larger volume of user input, the user can correct the mistake without having to re-enter the input that already was correct.  </s>
<s> Who benefits: Individuals with severe physical disabilities often need a lot of time to fill in forms.  </s>
<s> If they can correct the mistakes without having to re-enter all the data, this saves them a lot of effort.  </s>
<s> Example 2: a user form with required fields A user form with required fields checks if the user filled in all the required fields.  </s>
<s> If not, the user is presented with the same form and is informed which fields are missing.  </s>
<s> The information that was filled in correctly is still present in the form.  </s>
