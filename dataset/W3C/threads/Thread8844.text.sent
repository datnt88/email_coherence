Hi all, I created two signatures which re-create the example from [1]. 
One signature with, the other on omitting comments. 
The signatures use a HMAC-SHA1 which is created using the "secret".getBytes("UTF-8") 
'password'. 
Can anyone confirm? 
BTW, do we have any other test vectors for this spec? 
Merlin? 
Thanks Christian [1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-xfilter2/ Thanks Christian, I' ve created an interop report and this is the first test vector. 
*Note: I will be attending the W3C AC and WWW2002 meetings from May 5-10, and taking holiday from 13-16. 
I will not be as responsive during the former period, and off-line during the latter. 
I will fully respond to any email as soon as possible after my return. 
Thanks for adding that. 
Under [1] is another example which is created using my implementation... BTW, could you please change the name "WebSig" in the interops to "Apache"? 
Thanks, Christian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2002AprJun/att-0094/0 1-geuerp-esoteric-xmldsig-xfilter2.zip 
Ok, I think I got most of the ones on xmldsig, and I don't think you've sent a report on xenc yet. 
From now on, I'll use "apache".

Joseph, Please add XML Sec library to the XPath filter2 interop page since it passes all Christian's tests. 
Thanks, Aleksey.
