<s> Marti's comment got me thinking about drawing parallels to other disabilities and what we do there.  </s>
<s> Adding visual descriptions of pictures is adding something to a page that was not there.  </s>
<s> Could something equivalent be done for cognitive access?  </s>
<s> Two things that are true for LONGDESCs (and ALT) are 1)it doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users 2)it is fairly easy to describe how to do it (though quality will obviously vary) 3)it takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together to do it.  </s>
<s> so putting these together let me coin a term ALTCOGPRES (Alternative Cognitive Presentation) is there a way we can come up with a *straightforward*, *easy to describe* and *easy to do* technique for presenting information on a page in an alternate form that 1)doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users 2)is fairly easy to describe how to do it 3)takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together to do it.  </s>

<s> There are metadata dicitionaries around that describe words in terms of subclasses - eagle is a subclass of birds of prey, which is a subclass of birds, etc.  </s>
<s> These things are all in RDF, and should therefore be able to have a URI.  </s>
<s> Which would enable us to use RDF to link keywords, meanings, and illustrations.  </s>
<s> Which means we could build tools to add this kind of stuff.  </s>
