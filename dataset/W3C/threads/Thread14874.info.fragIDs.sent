Hi, An interesting methodology to decide on the quality of the report. 
Some people have found a methodology based on reading a report can often yield better insight into quality.

Hope no one plans on taking the report seriously - it's written by a man (Jakob Neilson) who excuses himself from making an accessible web page (that includes images/graphics) because he says he can't do it well. 
Is the price a joke?

This can only be true where the research is based on evidence. 
I offered to contribute a 'control' group with learning difficulties, and was advised they weren't needed. 
The designers of this report evidently had a pre-determined notion of what 
was relevant and our students were once again excluded.

Might even be happening herein? 
Hope not. 
Love. 
EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY
