<s> I recently followed the refences from KIF3 [2] back to your 1985 paper [5] which appears to solve a lot of important problems.  </s>
<s> I'm working on Semantic Web development at W3C / MIT-LCS [3], and we're very concerned with reasoning about belief and trust.  </s>
<s> My colleagues and I are generally trained more as software developers than logicians, but we're learning.  </s>
<s> (I've been helped immeasurably by occasionally discussions with Pat Hayes, Drew McDermott, Jim Hendler, Lynn Andrea Stein, and a few other kind souls you may know.) Anyway, your work looks tremendously useful, but I have a few questions I hope you might help me with.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> In 1995, the KIF standards committee decided [4] to stop using a truth predicate like yours in favor of the simpler "wtr", mostly on the grounds it and easier to implement (and, I think, reasoning about beliefs wasn't important to them).  </s>
<s> Do you have any implementation experience with your proposed system?  </s>
<s> Do you know of systems which use it?  </s>
<s> I can imagine axiomatizing it in FOL, and using a generic theorem-prover with it, but that's perhaps not very tractable.  </s>
<s> Do you know of such axioms written out somewhere?  </s>
<s> 2. Calling the truth predicate "true" seems misleading; do you know of a more precise name, something which evokes the Gilmore's star which is part of the definition?  </s>
<s> My best attempt so far is "neutrallyTrue", which suggests to me the kind of slight disempowering the star seems to perform.  </s>
<s> 3. Do you know of any important follow-up work, supporting or undercutting your work?  </s>
<s> How about explanations that are less technical than yours, but still detailed enough for a potential implementor to use?  </s>
<s> 4. Do you have rights to publish your paper on the web?  </s>
<s> I have a scanned copy, but of course by law I can't share that widely. 5. In KIF's LISP-like usage, and even more so in the RDF-based usage I imagine, the truth predicate is applied to an abstraction of a sentence (some tree/graph of logical connectives, predicates, and terms) rather than a simple sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> This might introduce additional dangerous self-reference possibilities if not done carefully.  </s>
<s> Do you know of any work on this issue?  </s>
<s> Thank you so much for any information you can provide.  </s>
<s> I greatly appreciate your time in this.  </s>

<s> Note: I have CC'd a public archive [1].  </s>
<s> If you CC it on your reply, it will be permanently archived on the web and thus much easier for me to refer to and share with people.  </s>
<s> Feel free to omit it if you're more comfortable answering privately.  </s>
<s> Don't worry about addressing a wider audience in a CC'd reply; the archive is understood to simply contain e-mail that people are willing to have kept around for future reference.  </s>

<s> Note to self: this is a poor way to address this problem.  </s>
<s> Much better would be to simply ask at the bottom: "May I archive your response on the web as part of my research notes, or would you prefer I keep it confidential?"  </s>
<s> I thought it worked quite well.  </s>
<s> Particularly as anyone replying and copying www-archive will get a msg from gerald's list archive permissions system, so advance warning is useful.  </s>

<s> ps. this is my favourite mailing list...  </s>
<s> But he didn't include it on his CC, and he didn't say anything about it, and there was nothing in his mail that shouldn't be archived as far as I can tell.  </s>
<s> Speaking of which, why didn't you keep www-archive in your cc? :-)  </s>
<s> Oh, oops, I meant to.  </s>
<s> No matter.  </s>
<s> Re-adding :)  </s>
<s> www-archive is an elegant hack, but it would sure be nice to just have a proper shared database of e-mail!  </s>
<s> IMAP has some such facilities.  </s>
<s> Bristol Uni uses shared IMAP folders a lot.  </s>
<s> Seems to be a lot of overlap between IMAP and HTTP though; maybe someone'll do a Web-service based workalike sometime.  </s>
