<s> The May draft is unclear about whether there can be more than one library module with the same target namespace.  </s>
<s> The description of ModuleImport implies that the import is from *a* library module.  </s>
<s> However, the write-up of ModuleDecl just says the URI "serves as the target namespace of the module."  </s>
<s> It is a lot easier for an implementor if there is at most one module for a given URL.  </s>
<s> I assume that is the intention, but I think it should be made unambiguous.  </s>

<s> Like in the case of XML Schema, the number of actual library files is inconsequential since they will be presented as one unit for the purpose of the import.  </s>
<s> The management of the modules is outside of the XQuery specification's scope.  </s>
<s> The rules are specified as consistency constraints (no two functions can have conflicting signatures) instead of making limitations on the number of modules that you can or cannot define.  </s>
<s> Best regards Michael  </s>
<s> The choice is between (1) a LibraryModule has a unique name, and thus a unique identity, independent of the variables and functions defined in it; or (2) a LibraryModule in itself has no name or identity, but only *contributes* definitions to a namespace.  </s>
<s> Either alternative works, but there are pragmatic issues.  </s>
<s> * In case (2) then a ModuleImport needs to import the set of definitions exported by LibraryModules with a matching name.  </s>
<s> In that case it is possible for the set to be empty.  </s>
<s> This makes it difficult to catch a typo in a ModuleImport.  </s>
<s> Instead, we have to wait until the importing modules tries to use a name in the imported namespace.  </s>
<s> It is possible for a processor to emit a warning on importing an empty module, but this is problematical.  </s>
<s> * If a LibraryModule does not have its own name then tools such as compilers, dependency checkers, and even old-fashioned 'make' becomes more difficult to use and write.  </s>
<s> If a LibraryModule has its own name, then an implementation can specify a mapping for where it should be, and where to put compiled versions of it.  </s>
<s> If it does not have its own name, things become much more complicated.  </s>
<s> Note how Java class names are traditionally mapped to file names, and how a URL is mapped by a browser to a file name.  </s>
<s> This does make things easier to understand, explain, and manage.  </s>
<s> * If a LibraryModule has its own name, an implementation can easily compile it to unique own file or directory.  </s>
<s> E.g. a LibraryModule can be compiled to a Java class or a dll.  </s>
<s> Without its own name, each function or variale definition has to be compiled to a separate file, since they are the only entities with non-anonymous identity.  </s>
<s> This may be significantlty less efficient.  </s>
<s> In my case I would rather compile a LibraryModule to a Java class, than compile each function to its own class.  </s>
<s> * If an import module can resolve to an unknown number of LibraryModules, that implies finding all the modules that match some URI.  </s>
<s> (That is unless we we punt and just look up variables and functions individually.) Finding all the entities maching a URI is a search operation that URLs traditionally have not supported.  </s>
<s> * Finally, if interpretation (2) is the correct one, then I don't see any point to having ModuleDecl and ModuleImport in the language.  </s>
<s> The don't provide any power or convenience that I can't get by using namespace declarations alone.  </s>
<s> For example in my Java implementation, I can just map each expanded QName to a Java class names, and I can find each function using its class name.  </s>
<s> The module import provides no are organization or convenience, so just drop it: it's just confusing clutter.  </s>
