<s> Since you mentioned the subject .. does anyone know how the IETF agenda and BOF schedule is developing?  </s>
<s> The IETF web site agenda has not been updated since the 9th and we are just 2 weeks away.  </s>

<s> I think that people have to face the fact that the IETF is now going to become a "trailing edge" organization, not "leading edge".  </s>
<s> As with most standards organizations, it can play a role in documenting standards long AFTER they find industry acceptance.  </s>
<s> In the old days, the IETF could lead.  </s>
<s> In order to do that, they had to remain at the leading edge.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, that is clearly no longer the case....  </s>

<s> at least for the apps area, all scheduling was still on hold until last Monday.  </s>
<s> (we had groups pencilled in for slots but we wanted to wait until the request deadline before announcing anything, because we knew that changes were likely) even so we have had a couple of late requests and the agenda folks are still juggling things around to try to meet all of the constraints.  </s>
<s> but I've seen a couple of BOF announcements go out this morning, so they'll probably update the schedule soon.  </s>

<s> Maybe I will get this in before the APPS ADs... The usual exercise of changing the schedule to avoid the worst clashes is going on in real time.  </s>
<s> Last I heard, the tentative slot for Applcore was on Monday but *this may still change*.  </s>
<s> BTW assuming there is a BOF it will for sure not be discussing specific solutions at this stage.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I concur.  </s>
<s> The BOF will focus on scope, constraints and charter bashing.  </s>
<s> However, I encouraged Rob to put out his draft, because it doesn't hurt to have a few strawmen around as a proof-of-concept and to show there's interest in the problem.  </s>

<s> Do you feel that it is "bad" that the IETF is now a trailing-edge standards organization, just like the ITU, IEEE, and ANSI ?  </s>
<s> I suspect that some would find it attractive to be similar to those organizations.  </s>
<s> Clearly, many of the IETF members do.  </s>
<s> Those members collectively define whether the IETF is leading-edge or trailing-edge.  </s>
