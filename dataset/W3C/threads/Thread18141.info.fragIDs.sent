<s> Hello, I spent the day yesterday at Adobe (in San Jose) talking to developers about accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> I had some very productive discussions about a number of topics, including UAAG 1.0, accessibility of PDF viewers, and SVG.  </s>
<s> Here are two comments about UAAG 1.0 that I think we can address pretty easily.  </s>
<s> Note: I look forward to a full review from Adobe of the last call draft [1]. 1) Point 1: They would like the UAAG 1.0 to include a requirement that the conforming user agent allow other software to capture focus.  </s>
<s> I responded that I think our document covers that requirement in checkpoint 5.4: "5.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent user interface controls using standard APIs ..." Write access to the focus amounts to being able to capture the focus and change it.  </s>
<s> At least I think so.  </s>
<s> What do other people think?  </s>
<s> In checkpoint 5.5, we mention selection and focus explicitly as part of user interface controls.  </s>
<s> Should we do the same in 5.4 (or in a definition)?  </s>
<s> Should we just say in the Techniques document that assistive technologies and other software (in this case an SVG rendering engine) needs to be able to take focus.  </s>
<s> I also pointed out that checkpoint 7.1 requires navigation to all viewports (in this case, an SVG viewport), but that doesn't cover the issue exactly.  </s>
<s> 2) Point 2: In rendering PDF, Acrobat (on Windows) does not use standard system calls for drawing text to the screen.  </s>
<s> Instead, it creates a bitmap itself and causes that to be displayed.  </s>
<s> Since PDF is a low-level page description format, is it "ok" for them to do their own bitmap (since that's what the language is about) creation?  </s>
<s> Note: Acrobat Reader implements MSAA apparently, so it satisfies checkpoint 1.2's requirement to use standard APIs for the OS.  </s>
<s> However, it does not use the standard device API for drawing text.  </s>
<s> 3) Point 3: Checkpoint 6.2 says to use and conform to W3C specs.  </s>
<s> Does this checkpoint apply to the Acrobat Reader since they only read and render PDF?  </s>
<s> I think that we need to consider ways to help developers and readers interpret "appropriate for a task".  </s>
<s> W3C doesn't (yet) specify a similar "page description format"; HTML is not about pixel-perfect rendering on paper/the screen (the HTML spec emphasizes the fact that it does not require particular rendering).  </s>
<s> You could argue that HTML + CSS are the appropriate languages, but even that seems far-fetched to me.  </s>
<s> A larger question is (and of course it's related to applicability): should software that doesn't implement W3C specifications at all be able to claim conformance?  </s>
<s> I personally would like the UAAG 1.0 to be applicable to user agents in general, not just user agents that implement W3C formats.  </s>
<s> I think there is some grey area that we need to work on: - If you are creating an imitation of a W3C format (or if W3C is creating an imitation of yours...), then for the sake of interoperability and also because of the way W3C works (with WAI review, etc.), you should (P2) implement the W3C spec.  </s>
<s> So, implement PNG at least, but if you wish, GIF, JPG, etc. - If you are doing something entirely different, 6.2 doesn't apply, and you can still conform.  </s>
<s> How can we provide guidance for determining what is "available" (e.g., implemented sufficiently) and "appropriate for a task"?  </s>
<s> I think it's easier to talk about 'available' than 'appropriate for a task'.  </s>
<s> I don't have any proposals today to address this.  </s>

<s> Ian, Good to hear that Adobe is interested in the guidelines and that you had a chance to meet with them!  </s>
<s> JRG: We use to have a separate checkpoint that was considered an important special case of 5.5[1].  </s>
<s> So my understanding is that this functionality was is part of the current 5.5.  </s>
<s> JRG: The group may want to consider modifying the current checkpoint 5.3 to say: 5.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic access to content using either standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating system) or other APIs that are defined to support communication with assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note: This checkpoint addresses content not covered by checkpoints checkpoint 5.1 and checkpoint 5.2.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.3 5.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic access to content using standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating system).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note: This checkpoint addresses content not covered by checkpoints checkpoint 5.1 and checkpoint 5.2.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.3  </s>
<s> JRG: I think this is exactly the situation that 5.3 was designed to handle.  </s>
<s> Maybe if we modify 5.3 to include accessibility APIs we can expand the scope of this checkpoint.  </s>

<s> If gregory were here he would scream.  </s>
<s> One of my biggest headaches is things "brabbing the focus".  </s>
<s> The sad thing here seems to be that they seem to be developping a solution for only one platform.  </s>
<s> With all the system hooks around for different opperating systems, I'd have figured that as long as they have been envolved in software development the solution to access would be more platform independant.  </s>
<s> Has anyone seen their new implementation?  </s>

<s> The requestion wasn't to grab the focus, but have the right to have it!  </s>
<s> Apparently there was an IE bug that prevented the SVG viewer from getting the focus at all.  </s>
