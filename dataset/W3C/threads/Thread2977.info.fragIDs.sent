Hi, 
when is the data sent in a post request .Does the client send the data at the initiating request ort does it wait for some sort of conformation from the server( No Expect headers are being used). 
For example 
, the client might wait for the conformation from the server as to which type of content the server is ready to accept. 
Though POST method can be implementation matter but what is the most general form of usage of POST method.

HTTP/1.1 allows for the use of a 100 Continue response to signal 
readiness from the server: Scott Lawrence Actively seeking work 
RFC mentions that Origin servers *MAY* send 100 continue if expect header is not sent from client.

Whenever the client wants to send it. 
Because 100 Continue was not in earlier versions of the protocol, we could not require that the client wait for it; besides, in some applications it wouldn't be worth the extra round trip time and server load.
