Hi were do you get Tidy for Linux, I went to 
From Eric 
Hi Eric, go to the tidy webpage at http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/. There you'll find a link (section "downloading tidy" to hat linux. 
If you are using a different linux and the red hat rpm does not work for you, just download the source code from the tidy webpage (pretty far down the page). 
Make shure to get the Unix .tgz 
file. 
Then untar it via "gtar -xzvf tidy4aug00.tgz" and use the make command "make tidy" to produce the binary. 
Then moove the binary to your ~/bin diretory.

Ainsi parlait Alexander Biron : 
Mandrake also ships a tidy-20000408 package in contribs. 
If current cvs code is usable, i would be glad to provide an updated package.

If you go to the home page http://tidy.sourceforge.net 
, you will find some recent builds for various platforms. 
Unfortunately I can't access SourceForge right at the moment, so I can't give you more details. 
I am planning on running a nightly cron job that uploads to the web site, the latest sources (tarballs?) and binaries for the platforms supported by SourceForge's compile farm. 
I was in the middle of doing that when SourceForge apparently wandered away... Regards, Terry
