I suggest we remove the NOTATION complex type ( and attribute declaration ) from the encoding schema. 
As several commentators have observed the NOTATION type from the attributes. 
However, the extended NOTATION type in the attributes, id and href. 
Obviously an attribute cannot itself have attributes. 
I'm reasonably confident that removing this type from the encoding schema will have zero impact on implementations ( because AFAIK no one is using the NOTATION type ). 
Comments, flames and counter proposals to the usual address Martin Gudgin DevelopMentor Suggest you post this to dist-app as a proposal for a new issue.
