"Web accessibility techniques can reduce the server load, thus reducing the need for additional servers and increasing the download speed" Could you provide information to support this claim - for the references page. 
Thanks! 
~ shawn What do you mean by "increased infrastructure" ? 
~ shawn First, I suggest a late rewording to: "Web accessibility techniques can reduce the server load, thus reducing the need for additional servers and/or increasing the download speed" Refs: 1. Websites for Rural Australia Designing for Accessibility http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/HCC/00-13pdf - only available as a PDF and not entirely correct wrt accessibility for PWD (rather refers to access for rural Australia, but many solutions are related to WCAG, including clean code) 2. Speed Up Your Site: Web Site Optimization http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/ - again not always entirely accurate from a WAI perspective, but many bits relate to WCAG (though some bits conflict) 3. Are we there yet?

~ shawn increased infrastructure = bigger pipes (bandwidth), faster/more servers, etc "Shawn Lawton Subject: RE: tech factors - copyedits and refs 24/03/2004 11:51 AM What do you mean by "increased infrastructure" ? 
~ shawn Andrew &amp; Henk, Most updates are incorporated in: previous version is at: comments surrounded by brackets ([...]) below. 
let me know if you want to discuss any of this. 
Best, ~ Shawn [DONE] alignment of suite contents menu (tf is indented on this page - different on difefrent pages of suite) Status (of doc) is difefrent between different pages of the suite [changing this sentence throughout the suite] can be presented based on how = can be included depending on whether (??) and [DONE] effortby defining = and effort by defining (this is a common problem on this page - the lack of a space between words) [hummm, this is technical factors page, not financial factors] Need to emphasise the potential financial benefits and link Cost Savings /link at the end of the Introduction. 
Reduce Site Development and Maintenance Time Facilitate efficient debugging [DONE] WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 11.1, 3.2 = WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 11.1, 3.2, 11.2 content [DONE] repacking time = content repackaging time (or would re-use or revelopment be better terms?) Reduce Server Load [OK, need "proof" for references] @@ is this accurate?? YES (according to HS and AA) [? what is the increased infrastructure?]

[do you have any of these?] is this where we were going to put in some third party references supporting the material in this section?? done (will update online later) It seems that many of the resources that we want to reference in support of our assertions have not so good information in them. 
Perhaps we should include in our references page the bits that are related to our points. 
(still link to the entire reference - but maybe having the quoted bits will slow people down from reading the entire resource) What do you think? 
~ Shawn WRT refs - good idea. 
This is what we do in our workshops - highlights, and let them follow-up the rest (with our caveat) if they want to.
