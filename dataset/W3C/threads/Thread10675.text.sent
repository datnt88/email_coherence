The RDFCore WG have asked me to send this comment on their behalf, as an addition to others already sent. 
Brian owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite. 
This seems to be described only in S+AS which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to many. 
On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer. 
We cannot be confident, therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been missed. 
RDFCore requests that the specifications be amended to include a description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and OWL Lite. 
This description should be as accurate as possible consistent with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community. 
Such a description may bring to light further issues. 
After some offlist discussion with JimH about this comment, I'd like to emphasize that it concerns an "RDF Document" which was intended to mean primarily RDF instance data, though with hindsight might also apply to an RDFS schema. 
So the request is for some simple rules that, if followed, will ensure that an RDF document containing instance data (not an ontology) can be processed by an Owl DL reasoner, presumably in conjunction with an Owl DL ontology. 
This comment was generated when it was discovered that there is a restriction on the use of b-nodes, that had not been immediately apparent. 
A rule such as "Don't use rdf:nodeID", for example, might be appropriate. 
I am sending this personal clarification of the comment without consulting RDFCore, but am BCC'ing RDFCore so that folks there have the opportunity to review it. 
Brian I realized that in my reports to RDF Core about OWL DL I have emphasised some of the mismatches that I care about at the expense of other mismatches that other people might care about (and I have learnt to live with). 
As well as the bnode constraints, another, "in your face" constraint is that every node must be typed (classes and properties must be appropriately typed with OWL vocabulary not just RDFS). 
(Certain 'builtin' uri refs are excluded from this requirement as are literal nodes). 
This means that rdf:Description should usually not be used, and if you can't think of anything better to write owl:Thing usually substitutes for it. 
With URIref nodes the owl:imports mechanism can be used to have any missing type triples in a separate file.
