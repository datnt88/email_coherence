Hello Group, I am having problem when loading the xml document and saving the same using DOM. 
If the Program is intended to read SGML / XML document using DOM and write another Tagged Output, then DOM always strips the empty spaces present between two tags. 
For ex: If the Input document has a line like the following : This is a bold Sample /bold italic text /italic Then the DOM Ouput of the above line would be: This is a bold Sample /bold italic text /italic Pls. 
note that the space between /bold and italic tag is missing in the output. 
This problem will exist only if there are empty spaces between the tags. 
Can anybody in the group can help me how can i work around this problem.

The DOM, per se, should _NEVER_ strip whitespace. 
It represents whatever it's told to represent. 
If you're having a problem with this, talk to whoever wrote your DOM implementation, or (more likely) whoever wrote the code that is building the DOM (the parser or whatever else is acting as a DOM source).

There should be a text node between bold and italic elements. 
It would seem to a bug in the implementation that you are using, which, unfortunately, you did not specify either the implementation or version. 
You might look for a different version of the parser or a parser configuration flag like ignoreWhitespace or ignoreElementContentWhitespace and set that to false in case the behavior was an overaggressive elimination of whitespace. 
It is also possible that the text node but was wrongfully eliminated when written out to a file. 
To report a bug or get help on a specific implementation, you should use an appropriate newsgroup, mailing list or bug reporting system. 
For example, microsoft.public.xml for MSXML.
