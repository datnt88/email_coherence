<s> Hello Group, I am having problem when loading the xml document and saving the same using DOM.  </s>
<s> If the Program is intended to read SGML / XML document using DOM and write another Tagged Output, then DOM always strips the empty spaces present between two tags.  </s>
<s> For ex: If the Input document has a line like the following : This is a bold Sample /bold italic text /italic Then the DOM Ouput of the above line would be: This is a bold Sample /bold italic text /italic Pls.  </s>
<s> note that the space between /bold and italic tag is missing in the output.  </s>
<s> This problem will exist only if there are empty spaces between the tags.  </s>
<s> Can anybody in the group can help me how can i work around this problem.  </s>

<s> M When the going gets tough, the tough gets empirical  </s>
<s> The DOM, per se, should _NEVER_ strip whitespace.  </s>
<s> It represents whatever it's told to represent.  </s>
<s> If you're having a problem with this, talk to whoever wrote your DOM implementation, or (more likely) whoever wrote the code that is building the DOM (the parser or whatever else is acting as a DOM source).  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> There should be a text node between bold and italic elements.  </s>
<s> It would seem to a bug in the implementation that you are using, which, unfortunately, you did not specify either the implementation or version.  </s>
<s> You might look for a different version of the parser or a parser configuration flag like ignoreWhitespace or ignoreElementContentWhitespace and set that to false in case the behavior was an overaggressive elimination of whitespace.  </s>
<s> It is also possible that the text node but was wrongfully eliminated when written out to a file.  </s>
<s> To report a bug or get help on a specific implementation, you should use an appropriate newsgroup, mailing list or bug reporting system.  </s>
<s> For example, microsoft.public.xml for MSXML.  </s>
