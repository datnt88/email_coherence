<s> Hello all, Last night I accidentally sent the new draft of my alternate equivalents techniques piece to Charles only.  </s>
<s> I have attached it here.  </s>
<s> There is one html document and a number of illustrative images.  </s>
<s> The piece is still rough with only a short description of the images appearing above them, as well as some ALT text.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan  </s>

<s> Thanks Jan Having short descriptions in text is fine.  </s>
<s> One of the questions we will end up with is whether to use longdescs, d-links, or just describe images in the document text.  </s>
<s> Having something that may not be complete will still allow us to include it and get a feel for how the techniqeus document is developing, which is fairly important.  </s>
<s> Anyone else who has some stuff, please send it along.  </s>
<s> In fact I am not going to do the work until the end of the US east coast day today, so you have a few hours.  </s>
