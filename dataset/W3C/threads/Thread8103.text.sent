I think Jim Luther neglected to give the precise RSVP contact info for the Interim WG meeting: Please RSVP to Nora Mosqueda mosqueda@apple.com 
and let Nora know that you plan to attend the IETF WebDAV Working Group Interim Meeting (include "WebDAV WG Interim Meeting" in the title of your email), what day(s) you will be attending, and if you have any dietary requirements we should be aware of. 
Thanks! - Jim Hi, I'm in the process of finishing my edits on the ordered collections draft ([1]). 
The main changes are clarifications, rewriting of marshalling sections DeltaV-style, and a new section on the relation between ordered collections and version-controlled collections. 
Feedback appreciated. 
BTW: is anybody except ourselves currently implementing this protocol extension?

Hi. 
The draft 04 has been submitted to the IETF and is available from [1] and [2] (annotated html). 
I will continue my edits on the "latest" version [3].

Hi, I (think I) have finished my edits on the current draft (see [1]), and plan to submit it as -05 early next week. 
Jim: when submitting, do I need to do something special for the "last call" status?
