I recommend using deprecated elements for objects, as part of the content of an OBJECT. 
(I recommend thinking of IMG as just such a deprecated element, and I think HR should be deprecated) which gives me a slight problem. 
But they are fairly specific cases - the most common one is APPLET. 
Charles The ISO HTML draft attempts to capture the essential core of the language, excluding all of those features which are deprecated or which are likely to become obsolete. 
I can't remember the URL that refers to this draft, however. 
Final Committee Draft is available at: And also, User's Guide (not an ISO/IEC text) is available at: ISO-HTML is the strict subset of HTML 4.0 Strict DTD, thus any deprecated features which are not part of Strict DTD is not part of ISO-HTML as well. 
I've discussed with ISO-HTML editors at "Shaping the Future of HTML" workshop, to ensure that accessibility and internationalization (i18n) are essential features of HTML 4.0, so ISO-HTML should not omit any features regarding accessibility and i18n. 
I believe they are committed to do so, for example, summary attribute of TABLE element is REQUIRED in ISO-HTML. 
If you have any comments to ISO-HTML, I will contact the editors.

As you say, this is "work in progress." 
Susan Lesch I don't think authors will ever depreciate the use of IMG tag, due to backwards compatibility issues with older browsers.
