After talking to a screen reader user I have some new thoughts about IMGs and blank Alt text. 
If an HTML author inserts a transparent image into a document to provide space between two blocks of text then the Alt text should be set to spaces (Alt=" "). 
The number of spaces indicates the size of the space required - the size of the transparent image. 
Normally the screen reader would speak "image" then speak the Alt text. 
If an image has Alt text set to spaces then it would NOT speak "image" but simply pause before speaking the next block of text. 
In this way the transparent image would provide an aural pause that worked the same as the visual pause. 
The flow of the text from the screen reader would not be broken up with an unwanted "image" word. 
All images should have Alt text. 
Images that have Alt text set to Null (Alt="") would be incorrect. 
The WAI guidelines are at: but they do not seem to seem to clarify this matter. 
Make sense?

2. Chuck Opperman did not join the conference call to clarify his concerns. 
My apologies, however Active Accessibility version 1.2 shipped on November 11 and I was not available. 
I did participate in the joint UA-PA 
conference 
call that same day for an hour. 
I could not devote another hour to Authoring Tools. 
I'd like to suggest that the WAI get more coordinated in the conference 
call 
planning. 
Most conference calls I'm part of go way over time, usually just as the discussion is getting good. 
The timing of two calls over a 3 hour span is not practical for me. 

* If a tool does generate Alt text then the tool should inform the user and allow the user to change it. 
What's the expectation here? 
That the default placeholder strings be modifiable, or at the moment a default ALT text is inserted into HTML that the user be told and can change the string? 

* Tools should not generate NULL Alt text (Alt=""). 
(Anything inserted into a document has a meaning.) What about in the case of transparent images used for spacing purposes? 
Thanks! 
Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Accessibility and Disabilities Group, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!" -----Original Message----- From: Jutta Treviranus [mailto:jutta.treviranus@utoronto.ca] Sent: Thursday, November 19, 1998 7:45 AM Subject: Minutes: November 11 Conference Call The following are the minutes for the November 11, Conference Call. 
Present: Charles McCathie Neville, William L., Jan Richards, Karen McCall, Ian Jacobs, Lauren Wood, Jim Allen, Jutta Treviranus 1. Lauren Wood of SoftQuad gave her perspective on the Guidelines from the point of view of a developer. 
She felt that some guidelines were too draconian, not giving developers the flexibility to position their tool competitively ( 3.4.3 and 6.6.2). 
This would put developers who adopt the guidelines at a competitive disadvantage. 
Other guidelines were too broad and required further detail (ie, 5.5.3 &amp; 6.4.1). 
She also felt that guideline 4.3 was patronizing and suggested that the wording be changed. 
2. Chuck Opperman did not join the conference call to clarify his concerns. 
3. The previously posted, suggested wording on placeholder and default alt-text was accepted by the group: Automatic generation of Alt Text: * Tools should only generate Alt text when they are absolutly sure of the meaning (bullets for example) * If a tool does generate Alt text then the tool should inform the user and allow the user to change it. 
Place-holder Alt text: * Tools must not generate place-holder Alt text (ever). 
* Tools can generate a comment line close to the missing Alt text as a reminder - (example ! 
put Alt text here ) * Tools should not generate NULL Alt text (Alt=""). 
(Anything inserted into a document has a meaning.) 4. Based upon input from Judy Brewer it was decided that User Interface accessibility would stay in. 
The document would refer to the UA guidelines but may incorporate the relevant UA guidelines in the next draft. 
5. Ian presented his perspective on techniques: techniques being recommended or required actions that can be checked off by a developer as being complete. 
In other groups the techniques are maintained in a seperate document. 
The rationale being that techniques would change more rapidly than guidelines. 
It was decided that the techniques would remain integrated with the guidelines and would be linked to examples. 
6. 
The public working draft would be released Nov. 12, incorporating the agreed upon revisions. 
Not quite. 
The use of spacer images is primarily a kluge to support visual layout. 
In some cases these images are completely irrelevant to non-visual media, and should be ignored completely, by providing null ALT values (ALT=""). 
This also applies to some 'eye candy', or images used to fill in space, although one could provide ALT="dum de dum de dum" just to make it as annoying to non-visual users as to visual users waiting to download it. 
All images should indeed have ALT text. 
However, a null value is not intrinsically unacceptable as ALT text.

I was trying to create a method where screen readers could discern the purpose of an image. 
if "these images are completely irrelevant to non-visual media, and should be ignored completely" then the screen reader should be confident that that is the case. 
Some HTML editors set the Alt text to null (ALT="") and let the user fill it 
in later. 
If a screen reader came across an image with null Alt text then they would have to assume that the image was not a 'spacer' and would have to say "image". 
If the image had Alt text of spaces (ALT=" ") then the screen reader could assume that the author intended the image to be a 'spacer' and could ignore 
it or pause the speech output. 
Chris P.S. This reminds me of a Seinfeld episode. 
It's a discussion about nothing 

Some HTML editors set the Alt text to null (ALT="") and let the user fill it 
in later. 
If a screen reader came across an image with null Alt text then they would have to assume that the image was not a 'spacer' and would have to say "image". 
Ah - the root of the issue - a HTML authoring tool should never automatically set ALT="", but should allow the user to do. 
I agree. 
But it still happens. 
If a screen reader comes across an image that has ALT="", can we reccomend that it informs the user an image is there? 
The screen reader would still speak "image" or "image, no alt text". 
If a screen reader comes across an image that has ALT =" " (Alt text with spaces), can we reccomend that it ignore the image or pause it's output?
