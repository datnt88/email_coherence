<s> Ares FontMonger Although a budget program, FontMonger allows basic outline editing, import and export of Type 1 and TrueType (and several other scalable formats).  </s>
<s> Its autohinting isn't awful either.  </s>
<s> Adobe, which now owns Ares, no longer promotes FontMonger but it is still avaiable from some computer stores.  </s>
<s> Runs on Windows 3.1 and above.  </s>
<s> You could try asking Adobe, depending on whether you assume "no longer promotes" is the same as "no longer supports".  </s>
