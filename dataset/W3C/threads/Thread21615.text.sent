Whenever Mark or Sam linked to a story on another site, they wrapped cite tags around the name. 
So where you would write: a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
NY Times /a : "A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born." 
They'd do: cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
Some Article /a . 
"A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born." 
Now they have a script that looks for all these cite tags and reorganizes them by the thing being cited. 
So the NY Times page lists all entries that have cite NY Times /cite and so on.

The problem is that it relies on the ability of the person who writes to do it always in a consistent way, which is almost bearable with one author and almost impossible in a multiple authors environment :) and you can also do something like cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
Some Article /a . 
q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born. 
/q I always thought that a mechanism was missing in HTML to associate authors and sources (like RDF does). 
Because even in my example you associate easily the title with the citation, but you do not associate the journal in a unique reference system. 
Add to that an author. 
cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
Some Article /a . 
q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born. 
/q , cite Paul Smith /cite A reference system could have been, but not very practical: cite inref="art001" NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
inref="art001" Some Article /a . 
q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
inref="art001" A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born. 
/q , cite inref="art001" Paul Smith /cite Another way could have been cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
Some Article /a . 
q href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born. 
/q , cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
Paul Smith /cite :))) so much to do, the future has many things to come. 
And talk about poetry ;) and the structure of poems and it's even wider :) Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- Reading Mark Pilgrim [1] has an immediate benefit for the reader, activate the brain engine. 
Mark, keep going, it's great :) There are manuals [2] online for online citation where the reference is online. 
What about a french article (just for the purpose of another interesting attribute): Philippe Breton, "Le culte d'Internet", Le Monde Diplomatique, octobre 2000, page 36 citation: "Le culte de l'Internet est un culte jeune, de jeunes et pour les jeunes. 
Il est con?u comme une sorte de processus de ? 
r?volution permanente ?, o? ce sont les ? 
jeunes ? 
qui d?terminent la direction du mouvement." 
The usual citation system will be like: Breton, P. "Le culte d'Internet". 
Le Monde Diplomatique. 
octobre 2000: 36. 
The mark-up will be closeof that. 
a href="http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/10/BRETON/14335" hreflang="fr" Le culte d'Internet /a /q /cite . 
cite title="Newspaper" lang="fr" Le Monde Diplomatique /cite . 
cite title="Date" Octobre 2000 /cite : Le culte de l'Internet est un culte jeune, de jeunes et pour les jeunes. 
Il est con?u comme une sorte de processus de ? 
r?volution permanente ?, o? ce sont les ? 
jeunes ? 
qui d?terminent la direction du mouvement. 
All of this seems easy, but in some Weblog systems, or editing tools, it's very easy to have a menu which will deal with all of that. 
We do not have to bury the editor with tons of code but to give him/her the tools that will do it. 
I want to come back on some little things: * lang="fr" Gives the language of what you have cited. 
Very useful in an international context. 
On my personal weblog, which is in french, and have number of english citations, I'm using it all the time. 
Here I have supposed to be in an english context. 
Benefits: 1. 
If you do a script like the one of Mark Pilgrim, you can add feature like: "Give me all the french citations of my weblog". 
2. Automatic translator could implement it to not translate part which should not. 
If you ask now to an automatic translator to translate the page from english to french, it will also try to translate the french in french. 
Stupid. 
* hreflang="fr" Not well known tag but that I have awakened [3] in the french web log community with the power of CSS. 
The two benefits: 1. (Now) You can display the language of the link for your user. 
So someone, who doesn't know at all french, will not be forced to follow the link and come back because he/she can't understand. 
How? with CSS rules. 
a[hreflang]:after { content: " [" attr(hreflang) "] "; font-size: 0.9em;} It will display the language of the resource just after the link between square brackets. 
In our example, it will give: Breton, P. "Le culte d'Internet [fr]". 
Le Monde Diplomatique. 
octobre 2000: 36. 
It's very useful for blogroll too or any links you have in your pages. 
2. (Future) Search engines will benefit of it in the future and will have a better indexing if they know the language of the source before the indexation. 
* q I'm using the q tag because it has a very useful purpose which is to choose the right quotation mark depending on the language context. 
If you do a citation in french, you have to use ? 
blabla ?, in english, "blabla", in spanish, etc. 
The spaces and the characters used are different depending on the nesting language of the citation, not the citation itself. 
The problem is that it's not yet well displayed in Mozilla, they are fixing it. 
Mac IE 5 does it right. 
PS: Now I have to translate all of that to put on my weblog :p [1] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope [2] http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html
