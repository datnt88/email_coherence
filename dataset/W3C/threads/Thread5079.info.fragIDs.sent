<s> Dan, during the Semweb CG call today [1] you expressed an interest in the RDF+XHTML document type specifying (1) how the RDF is extracted from the XHTML and (2) that the validation service yield triples.  </s>
<s> This exceeds the present "dominant" requirement that "The RDF metadata MUST be well-formed XML but need not be valid XML (RDF validation is left to the discretion of the RDF application.)"  </s>
<s> Did I understand you correctly, and if so can you speak to the motivation for your requirement or provide any pointers to how such a validator could be layered on top of [3] -- if you are familiar with it?  </s>

<s> I don't see this as a design requirement, but more of a deployment motivation.  </s>
<s> If there's a service that rewards folks for composing documents the right way, then folks will (more likely) compose their documents the right way.  </s>
<s> If there's a service that shows that RDF consumers should learn from these documents, then RDF consuming software will (more likely) be enhanced to support this syntax.  </s>
<s> Also, if the design is too complex to deploy in our RDF validator, then that says something.  </s>
<s> Hmm... in a way, it does provide a design constraint: it answers all the questions about whether RDF inside blockquote is to be taken literally or not; i.e. it makes sure the solution addresses the TAG issue  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Not necessarily.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any evidence that the issue is a compelling requirement in the context of immediate issues we are hoping to address.  </s>
<s> CC, FOAF, Trackbacks, DC all seem most easily addressable by having semantically context free RDF chunks with a properly specified rdf:about attribute.  </s>
<s> Er... hang on; you asked me what my requirement is.  </s>
<s> I told you.  </s>
<s> You can decline to accept my requirement, but you can't deny that I require it.  </s>
<s> I don't expect the TAG to close its issue until there's a design that makes it clear whether RDF inside blockquote is to be taken at face value or not.  </s>
<s> If they do, it'll be over my objection.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Very well, everybody would appreciate if the TAG clarifies the semantics for embedding RDF in XHTML (and other vocabularies), once and for all.  </s>
<s> May I ask the issue owner to propose a solution?  </s>
