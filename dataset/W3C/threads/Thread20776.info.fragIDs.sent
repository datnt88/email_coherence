<s> Hello, I read the documentation and searched the ML-archive, and shoudn't find an issue about this.  </s>
<s> Here is my problem: My web pages are hosted by web servers enabling the use of embedded PHP-scripts.  </s>
<s> These scripts can be pointed to the attention of the web server by many ways, one of them being the ?PHP... the php script ...? tag.  </s>
<s> My problem is that there is a confusion with the DOCTYPE header, that is being foreworded by the XML declaration: That makes the web server to confuse about this tag, and point out a PHP syntax error, even in my pure HTML documents (saved with the HTML extension).  </s>
<s> My impression is that Amaya 5.1 didn't insert this tag.  </s>
<s> So I would like to disable the auto-insertion of this tag, or modify the Doctype header so that it doesn't wake the PHP-mod of Apache.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to do that?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> To me, the bug is on the server side.  </s>
<s> Confusing the XML declaration and a processing instruction is clearly a bug.  </s>
<s> The thing that starts with ?PHP... is not a tag, but a Processing Instruction (refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-pi ) intended for PHP (PHP is the target).  </s>
<s> The spec clearly states "The target names "XML", "xml", and so on are reserved".  </s>
<s> So, PHP-mod should silently ignore the special PI that starts with ?xml...  </s>
<s> The best solution would probably be to fix the PHP-mod of Apache.  </s>
<s> Another solution would be to save the document as HTML, as opposed to XHTML.  </s>
<s> Then, Amaya would not generate the XML declaration.  </s>
<s> To do that, just select "HTML" in the "Document Format" menu of the "Save as" dialog box.  </s>
<s> But that's a pity to return to the old crappy HTML when your documents are already XHTML.  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
<s> Well, I didn't try on other servers, but now that you say it, I must see that I had never heard of similar problems.  </s>
<s> So I will talk my provider about it.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> It is better to make real XHTML docs.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
