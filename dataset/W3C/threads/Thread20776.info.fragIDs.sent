Hello, I read the documentation and searched the ML-archive, and shoudn't find an issue about this. 
Here is my problem: My web pages are hosted by web servers enabling the use of embedded PHP-scripts. 
These scripts can be pointed to the attention of the web server by many ways, one of them being the ?PHP... the php script ...? tag. 
My problem is that there is a confusion with the DOCTYPE header, that is being foreworded by the XML declaration: That makes the web server to confuse about this tag, and point out a PHP syntax error, even in my pure HTML documents (saved with the HTML extension). 
My impression is that Amaya 5.1 didn't insert this tag. 
So I would like to disable the auto-insertion of this tag, or modify the Doctype header so that it doesn't wake the PHP-mod of Apache. 
Is there a way to do that? 
Thanks in advance.

To me, the bug is on the server side. 
Confusing the XML declaration and a processing instruction is clearly a bug. 
The thing that starts with ?PHP... is not a tag, but a Processing Instruction (refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-pi ) intended for PHP (PHP is the target). 
The spec clearly states "The target names "XML", "xml", and so on are reserved". 
So, PHP-mod should silently ignore the special PI that starts with ?xml... 
The best solution would probably be to fix the PHP-mod of Apache. 
Another solution would be to save the document as HTML, as opposed to XHTML. 
Then, Amaya would not generate the XML declaration. 
To do that, just select "HTML" in the "Document Format" menu of the "Save as" dialog box. 
But that's a pity to return to the old crappy HTML when your documents are already XHTML. 
Vincent. 
Well, I didn't try on other servers, but now that you say it, I must see that I had never heard of similar problems. 
So I will talk my provider about it. 
I agree. 
It is better to make real XHTML docs. 
Thanks.
