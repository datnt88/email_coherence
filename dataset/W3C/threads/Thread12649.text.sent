Hi everyone What is your opinion of the Widgit software? 
I've been approached by a UK Government Department who are considering using Widgit on an alternative version of their site. 
An example of Widgit in practice can be viewed at The Widgit homepage is at http://www.widgit.com/ 
Kind regards Julie Howell Campaigns Officer (Internet) Royal National Institute for the Blind 224 Great Portland Street, London W1W 5AA, UK Jhowell@rnib.org.uk 1.7 million people in the UK experience a serious sight problem or blindness. 
Poor Web design prevents many disabled people from getting the most from the Web.

Watch our video 'Websites That Work' on the Web at William Hague, leader of the opposition in the UK, suggested that policy should be summarised in 6 words or less.

The Meldreth Manor website is worth a very good look. 
The author is very well known, and produces excellent resources. 
Photographs are an essential part of the experience, as is sound, (mine's not working at the minute.)* 
Staff often complain (to me) that images and text are very hard to edit, or format, after publication in widgit. 
eg on this page: you will find that all the text and symbols are one large gif. 
Perhaps Julie could expand on the benefits of widgit. 
I would be excited to see draft pages, (for the proposed site) produced by skilled operators, with widgit.

To celebrate, there will be a slightly slow site (~80-160kb/page, or more), 'THINGS WE DO' with sound, photographs, symbols and text, and hopefully fully accessible. 
just at the moment I'm suffering from hd failure, screech, screech, clunk. 
How about: "UK's Hague seeks policy tersification"? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
