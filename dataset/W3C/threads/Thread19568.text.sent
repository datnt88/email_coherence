1. Drag and drop image/HTML files into browser to view (and in the case of HTML to edit). 
It works in IE, Frontpage Exploder, Netscape, and Netscrap Composer, why not Amaya? 
(This might not be implementable in Unix/X, only Win32 platforms...oh well. 
Better some than none.) 2. Help doesn't provide full coverage of all aspects of Amaya2.0a that are non-intuitive (e.g. how to work around the lack of a symbol-entry palette for special characters and apparent incompatibility with Windows charmap. 
And how *do* Unixies manage it without anything even resembling charmap?) 3. Color browser doesn't want to open in 2.0a. 
E.g., in structure view, select a body and attribute menu, item bgcolor. 
You get a text entry dialog. 
Unless you're a real whiz-zoom and know hex codes off by heart for your favorite colors, this is worthless without a color-picker dialog. 
4. Table edit is crufty in Amaya 2.0a. 
Specifically, one situation that is tricky is changing two columns on a row to two rows with one column each. 
Cut either td element. 
Then make a new row, paste the td into it. 
It should do what you want but fails, for Amaya pastes in your cut td, and then adds a second, blank td for no reason. 
(Stray CR/LF in the cut?) To make the table neat and rectangular, it adds a td on the other row too. 
This would be okay except that it adds it *before* the pre- existing td. 
Now you have a table like a checker-board. 
You can't delete either blank td. 
The only workaround seems to be splitting the whole table in two (with copy/paste) and then copying their lone tr/td/stuff and pasting as two rows into a *third* table and deleting the first two. 
5. There appears to be a memory leak with image manipulations. 
Large leak, very dangerous.

Actually, there is a standard Drag'N'Drop protocol for X-windows now.

[Re: table edit criftiness] I tried that. 
I seem to recall the result being a GPF in user.exe, or something similar... Get free e-mail and a permanent address at http://www.netaddress.com/?N=1 
To pick a nit: it is the "X Window System", not X-windows. 
And yes, there is dnd in X, and with the Gnome desktop, you can properly drag and drop hyperlinks out of netscape onto the panel or the desktop, and everything works fine... - Jim Sender: www-amaya-request@w3.org From: Andrew Pam xanni@glasswings.com.au
