<s> declare: A declare element has an optional interface attribute, I guess this should be mandatory dom methods:  </s>
<s> Every dom method has an optional interface attribute.  </s>
<s> Variables are already declared and have therefore already a type.  </s>
<s> The interface attribute is redundant here.  </s>
<s> A stylesheet can easily pick up the type from the declare element.  </s>
<s> method parameters.  </s>
<s> Methods parameters are currently passed through named attributes of a "method" element.  </s>
<s> I might be incorrect but it seems to that you than need to specify every method in the xml2java stylesheet.  </s>
<s> If this can be automated than it's fine with me, If we on the otherhand need to code every method by hand in this stylesheet than I suggest something like: In such a setup we can create the stylesheet easily for every method.  </s>

<s> CVS I've created a www-dom-ts module within the xmlconf CVS for www-dom-ts related work.  </s>
<s> I'll be adding more things to that module as I clean things up.  </s>
<s> In an earlier version, I had used the declare element to indicate a variable declaration.  </s>
<s> However, later I realized that this conflicted with the element generated for the declare attribute of the HTMLObjectElement interface.  </s>
<s> Subsequent  </s>
<s> schemas have used var for variable declaration and the type attribute is required.  </s>
<s> The interface attribute is unnecessary (and optional) for the vast majority of methods and properties.  </s>
<s> The only time it is required is when the same method or property is independently introduced in multiple interfaces, for example, Event.target and ProcessingInstruction.target or ProcessingInstruction.data and CharacterData.data.  </s>
<s> In these cases, the interface attribute allows you to disambiguate between the two forms, which in this case have substantially different signatures.  </s>
<s> You can't depend on the type of obj since casts are automatically generated by the transform and if the obj type is Node and the property was data, you couldn't determine if ProcessingInstruction.data or CharacterData.data was intended.  </s>
<s> I produced an optional interface attribute for instances where you are writing a test for a particular DOM level but you anticipate that there might be a name conflict in a later DOM level.  </s>
<s> That is you could do: However, if allowing that future-proofing is confusing it can easily be removed from the schema generator.  </s>
<s> It is only necessary to introduce explicit templates for the language constructs like if , for-while , etc. DOM methods and properties are generated by generic templates that compare the element in the test with the interface definitions in the DOM spec and properly generate the appropriate code.  </s>
<s> ok  </s>
<s> I understand that but the obj attribute refers to a "var" element that contains the type information.  </s>
<s> You therefore don't need to add the optional interface attribute.  </s>
<s> In the example given: eventTarget = evt.target();  </s>
<s> -- you know evt is of type "Event" targetStr = pi.target(); -- you know pi is of type ProcessingInstruction  </s>
<s> I guess you can, the cast can be retrieved from the "var" ELEMENT specified in the "var" ATTRIBUTE from the method element NOT the "obj" attribute from the method.  </s>
<s> So: Has every info you need to do: String eventTarget; Event evt; eventTarget = (String)evt.target();  </s>
<s> Without the optional interface attribute.  </s>
<s> Is there an updated xml2java.xsl  </s>
