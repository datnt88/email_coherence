And to my delight it doesn't mention "accessibility"! 
Welcome to QA. Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Bill, it does mention accessiblity. 
What I meant was that it didn't deal with "Accessibility" in the WAI sense. 
My goal is to emphasize all our activities as "accessibility" with a lower case "a" and the *feel* of her report is in that direction rather than the eternal message that we're about helping out some *other* set of people who are categorizable by their "disability". 
We are all members of one another and *every one of us* is significantly "disabled" until we can play/compose as well as Mozart, etc. 
We are all in this together until the gamma ray burster (or a big comet) hits, and "aCCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE". 
We've got to get over the idea that just because our society still imprisons/sterilizes/murders those who differ isn't any reason to pretend that there's some *they* out there who need *our* help. 
We're all out there and we all gain from this help - even something as "trivial" as an evaluation tool. 
It's not just for blind guys, it's for QA like the piece says. 
Love.
