Hi, As some of you know the company I work for, Origo Services (b-to-b, XML standards body for UK Life Insurance) ran a one day conference on XForms yesterday. 
I just wanted to quickly mention one or two product related things were mentioned that I thought might be of general interest. 
Firstly, David Boloker, IBM's CTO of Emerging Technologies told us that IBM has begun work on implementing XForms native in Mozilla (though he did say that it will take a _really_ long time to do). 
David also mentioned that they are also working on XForms support in WebSphere Portal Server, Lotus Workplace and Pervasive Computing. 
Secondly, Novell demo'ed an IE plug-in that they are working on. 
No release date was given, but we were told that it will be a free download when it is ready. 
All the best Mark

Mark, 
A practical question. 
Do you envisage that all XForms plugins for Internet Explorer will be equal? 
What is the benefit for the XForms community of having several viewers? 
I can see a benefit if one particular viewer is visibly substandard but if one assumes the existence of a complete and conforming XForms viewer for Internet Explorer what is the need for another? 
I can see a much more evident gap in the market for XForms design tools than 
in the market for XForms viewers. 
A couple of competent, usable XForms design tools are now around but, in my view at least, have some distance to go to catch up with Microsoft's InfoPath and Adobe's XML/PDF Designer as XML-based forms design tools. 
I am not knocking the XForms design tools but Microsoft and Adobe are not beginners at the job of creating good tools. 
And that experience shows. 
Thoughts?

Andrew, 
"Free" plugins available on the web are most of the time free as free bear and not as free speech without long term commitment from their author. 
That means that the companies that publish them can change their mind without any prior notice and either remove them or decide to make them paywares. 
IMO, a company that would roll out a big and strategic application with many forms involved would take a big risk to rely on only one implementation available for free, even if that implementation is fully conform to the rec. 
The number one reason I see among my customer for not using XForms at the moment is the lack of plugins working on each of the major browsers and the lack of design tools comes only in second position. 
In other words, the main blocking point for the adoption of XForms is still browser support and I am afraid the situation is not likely to change in the short term :-( ... My 0.02 Euros, Eric

Hi Andrew, Well, I agree that Microsoft and Adobe do development tools well. 
However, they do have one major drawback, and that is that they are hopeless for authoring XForms. 
At the conference yesterday Novell (exteNd) and Focus (XFormation) demo'ed their authoring tools, and whilst I would agree that they have ample room for improvement, both are very usable and lay a more than acceptable foundation for the future. 
There are other tools available now, like OnForm Xpress from Black Dog, and I know of several that are being worked on. 
It was also demonstrated yesterday that XForms can be authored indirectly. 
An organisation in the UK (Polaris) has built a portal that uses XForms, but all of the forms (and WSDL too incidentally) are automatically generated from annotated schemas. 
Personally I prefer a decent text editor, so I do most of my authoring in Macs. 
I realise that typing code directly won't be everyone's cup to tea (or coffee for that matter), but certainly for smaller projects, it really is no hardship. 
XForms is pretty readable on the whole, after all. 
In fact it is nice to use a markup that is usable without having to hide behind pretty authoring tools all the time (alas the same cannot really be said of W3C XML Schema). 
With regards to multiple XForms processors popping up all over the place, well I think that is important to help in the efforts to improve the XForms spec. 
We will always need many processors, because there are so many platforms that will require XForms support. 
I don't think it is a problem that we have several implementations for the same platform. 
All of the vendors are committed to achieving a high degree of interoperability, and this can only be achieved if the spec is clear. 
We can only know if the spec is well written, and works, if there are many implementations. 
If implementations achieve the goal of interoperability, then it doesn't matter if there are many for the same platform, if they don't, then we work on the spec. 
some more, or the implementers fix bugs. 
No one wants an XForms equivalent to browser wars. 
Many vendors are talking to each other very openly about implementation decisions, and where necessary these are feeding back into the development process. 
I think it is fair to talk of a growing community of XForms implementers at the moment. 
Obviously they are very aware that they need to compete with each other, equally obviously, they are very aware that they must not compete over their implementation of XForms itself. 
At the moment vendors are focusing on getting XForms onto the client, because no one will author XForms if no one can use XForms. 
No one will make very much money unless XForms becomes ubiquitous. 
Companies like Novell and x-port make their plug-ins free so that they can make money off the back of related products and services. 
Clearly there can, theoretically, still be rubbish implementations ;-) All the best Mark The information in this email is sent in confidence for the addressee only and may be legally privileged.
