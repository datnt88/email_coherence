Hi all, one of the things I am doing in my role with Fundacion Sidar is participating in the EuroAccessibility Consortium. 
They have started to do their technical public work, and I am a chair of one of their subgroups. 
(Anyone who is "european" can participate in the work - and anyone at all can send comments, although we haven't yet established a mailing list). 
The subgroup in question is looking at a methodology for examining evaluation tools, and working out how to integrate them into a clearly defined evaluation process. 
Its first task is to collect a list of tools used by EuroAccessibility members, or widely used in general. 
The work plan I will publish shortly outlines what the group will do, but in outline it will collect a list of tools, produce a basic proposal for a methodology, and then a concrete proposal for examining a number of tools and how they integrate into the testing methodology being developed in another public subgroup. 
These methodologies will be coordinated with WAI, who are after all the people qualified to interpret their specifications if there are unresolved questions. 
The first draft of the list is just tools used by Sidar, and is included at the bottom of this mail. 
I will publish shortly details of how to watch or participate in the subgroup's work.

A-Prompt is available in English, French and Korean. 
The German translation will be out by the end of August. 
It evaluates (and repairs) HTML. 
If Sidar is interested in looking at A-Prompt, they can download and use it at no cost from: Cheers, Chris 
Hello, Is there any interest in updating or reformatting or in some way reusing the list of tools at [1]?

Personally I am not that keen on updating it, although I do use it as a reference, and as a user I would like to see it maintained. 
I am interested in maintaining information on tools for the EuroAccessibility group, which would be a subset of those in the list. 
My idea at this stage would be to produce an Xform that can be used to read / update RDF data - if I do this I will also need to produce at least an XHTML version of the data, and I will naturally make all of that work available. 
If it were easy to update the information, and it were available in a machine-readable form, then I might be able to volunteer some time to update some of the information currently there (besides that which is directly relevant to my work with Sidar or EuroAccessibility). 
I would not be able to commit to maintaining that information though.

I note that WAVE is no longer available on the Temple site -- I suggest that W3C/WAI host it. 
It was certainly an easy-to-use tool, still appropriate for WCAG 1.0 and Section 508.

It's hosted by WebAIM, who have updated it and maintain it. 
It's a nice tool, not least because it has a nice visual interface that doesn't rely on language (just seeing the icons - the alt texts are of course monolingual - a limmitation of HTML). 
So I don't see that it is in desperate need of a home, since it is looking happy and cared-for where it is now.
