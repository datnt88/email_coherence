<s> Hi all, one of the things I am doing in my role with Fundacion Sidar is participating in the EuroAccessibility Consortium.  </s>
<s> They have started to do their technical public work, and I am a chair of one of their subgroups.  </s>
<s> (Anyone who is "european" can participate in the work - and anyone at all can send comments, although we haven't yet established a mailing list).  </s>
<s> The subgroup in question is looking at a methodology for examining evaluation tools, and working out how to integrate them into a clearly defined evaluation process.  </s>
<s> Its first task is to collect a list of tools used by EuroAccessibility members, or widely used in general.  </s>
<s> The work plan I will publish shortly outlines what the group will do, but in outline it will collect a list of tools, produce a basic proposal for a methodology, and then a concrete proposal for examining a number of tools and how they integrate into the testing methodology being developed in another public subgroup.  </s>
<s> These methodologies will be coordinated with WAI, who are after all the people qualified to interpret their specifications if there are unresolved questions.  </s>
<s> The first draft of the list is just tools used by Sidar, and is included at the bottom of this mail.  </s>
<s> I will publish shortly details of how to watch or participate in the subgroup's work.  </s>

<s> Personally I am not that keen on updating it, although I do use it as a reference, and as a user I would like to see it maintained.  </s>
<s> I am interested in maintaining information on tools for the EuroAccessibility group, which would be a subset of those in the list.  </s>
<s> My idea at this stage would be to produce an Xform that can be used to read / update RDF data - if I do this I will also need to produce at least an XHTML version of the data, and I will naturally make all of that work available.  </s>
<s> If it were easy to update the information, and it were available in a machine-readable form, then I might be able to volunteer some time to update some of the information currently there (besides that which is directly relevant to my work with Sidar or EuroAccessibility).  </s>
<s> I would not be able to commit to maintaining that information though.  </s>

<s> I note that WAVE is no longer available on the Temple site -- I suggest that W3C/WAI host it.  </s>
<s> It was certainly an easy-to-use tool, still appropriate for WCAG 1.0 and Section 508.  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey  </s>
<s> It's hosted by WebAIM, who have updated it and maintain it.  </s>
<s> It's a nice tool, not least because it has a nice visual interface that doesn't rely on language (just seeing the icons - the alt texts are of course monolingual - a limmitation of HTML).  </s>
<s> So I don't see that it is in desperate need of a home, since it is looking happy and cared-for where it is now.  </s>
