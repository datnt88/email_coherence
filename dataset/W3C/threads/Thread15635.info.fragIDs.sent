<s> Respectfully, I disagree with you.  </s>
<s> I strongly feel we need to keep the  </s>
<s> guidelines simple and leave the exceptions to the success criteria.  </s>
<s> As I see it, an empty string is a text equivalent too.  </s>
<s> So yes, I would  </s>
<s> require a decorative image to have a text equivalent: "".  </s>
<s> I do agree with  </s>
<s> you that we need to make this clearer than it is in the current formulation  </s>

<s> I agree with you but need to be clarify what is a "text equivalent".  </s>
<s> For  </s>
<s> me, text equivalent is, for eg, an "alt" attribute, not an empty tag.  </s>
<s> Remember that is different to have alt=" " and alt=""... second one is empty, first one is a blank space...  </s>
<s> with  </s>
<s> formulation  </s>
<s> Empty string is not a text equivalent... if it is "empty" it don't contain nothing :)  </s>
<s> With the permission of Roberto, I forward our off-list discussion about whether "" is a text equivalent or not.  </s>
<s> Our conclusion: The fact that two people who both know about accessibility can't agree on whether alt="" is a text equivalent or not means we need to work on our explanations!  </s>
<s> Yvette: Yes, we definitely do!  </s>
<s> Yvette: I know, I did mean alt="".  </s>
<s> I think we both agree that this is the correct way to handle decorative images.  </s>
<s> We just disagree on whether you can call that a text equivalent or not.  </s>
<s> I think an empty text equivalent still is a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> It's like in math: the empty set is a set too.  </s>
<s> Yvette: To me, that's the whole idea of alts for decorative images: that they  </s>
<s> contain nothing :-)  </s>

<s> Nothing is sometimes the best equivalent - at least for an alt value - longdesc didn't disappear :-) cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> I like this change, but I also fear that it ain't market-oriented -- IMO the least the WAI should legitimate *is* an alternative version of any site (e.g., imagine marketing agencies who feel a natural force to always conjure awesome Flash sites, though you and me don't like that).  </s>
<s> If you worry about an effect where authoring tool vendors like e.g. Macromedia now pass on implementing any kind of accessibility improvement, I understand this quite well.  </s>
<s> But there should be a reasonable balance since we cannot (or should not) ignore market needs completely (since this could easily turn into the opposite).  </s>
