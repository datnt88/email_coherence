Hi, Curtis Chong of the NFB is being interviewed at slashdot. 
This web site is pretty popular in the tech world, e.g. lots of linux stuff. 
The URL is: Scott PS Strong comments are quite common from readers of this web site. 
aloha, david! 
thanks for posting the URL for the curtis chung interview on slashdot... at the risk of violating several international copyright conventions, here's some of the content from: i took a listen to the questions which have already been posted, in an attempt to ascertain the accessibility awareness level of the self-proclaimed gear-heads and nerds who populate slashdot, and who happened across, or who were attracted to the posted topic: quote This week's interview guest is Curtis Chung, Director of Technology for the National Federation of the Blind, the group that is suing AOL over access for blind users. 
Chung is a bona fide expert on computer use by the blind; he's blind himself, and before he took his current job he spent 17 years "...with American Express as a designer/consultant, providing technical support for mainframe and mid range communication and operating system software." 
So ask away. 
One question per post, please. 
10 - 15 selected questions will be forwarded to Curtis Tuesday. 
Answers will appear Friday. 
unquote and -- as the following representative sample illustrates -- save for the occasional legitimate question and thoughtful comment, the level of awareness (let alone sensitivity) displayed by the denizens of slashdot in the posts and comments they have submitted to curtis is disturbingly (albeit not really surprisingly) low... it will, indeed, be interesting to hear which questions curtis chooses to answer... what follows is less a digest, than a to-do list for the Education and Outreach Working Group! 
Note: this digest only contains the questions posed by visitors to slashdot to curtis -- threads sprout from several, and can be accessed using the above (and below) cited URL... i apologize for the size of this post, but it takes a lot of patience (or copying-and-pasting from a browser to a text editor) to wade through the comments collected here, and i merely wanted to make the comments of the average person-in-the-infobahn available to the widest possible audience... --- begin content from http://slashdot.org/articles/99/12/06/093217.shtml 
Re:a question (Score:1) by Clanner on Monday December 06, @04:25PM EST (#259) (User Info) I'm curious to know what the ADA would deem the limit for accessibility issues. 
Granted, I don't know anyone who is legally blind in both eyes, but how would the blind be able to view a medium that is based in visual arts? 
If I post a website that deals primarily in, say, selling visual artwork, how would I realistically have a blind user view the artwork? 
What if my site is meant to demonstrate some Shockwave animations? 
At what point, if any, am I not responsible for accomodating every possible user? 
As a second question, I'd like to know if there was any dialogue between the NFB and AOL prior to the lawsuit, and if there was, what was the result of it? 
Or did the NFB target AOL strictly because it is the market leader in it's market? 
As a third, and final, question, wouldn't the money spent on this lawsuit be better spent on developing tools to make it easier for web designers to make their sites more accessible to all users?

Y'see, if there's no advantage to it, no one will do it except under pain of penalty. 
A description of advantages can be very persuasive: by making your webpage blind-compatible, you also make it useable by high-end, Palm Pilot-carrying executives; you make it printer-compatible, which means it'll show up in staff rooms; whatever.

The market dictates that blind people are a pain in the arse. 
Leaving it to the market would ensure that they would be excluded from dayly life. 
In my opinion this is unnecesarily cruel and a few simple, low cost regulations can make life much more interesting for blind people. 
Some patterns in the tiles on the pavement allow blind people to find their way. 
The cost of providing such tiles is so low that in my opinion its almost criminal not to provide them in large public areas. 
Why would websites be different? 
It can't be that hard to make a webpage accessible. 
Companies like AOL should be ashamed of letting it come to a trial. 
What they should have done is realize that there are lots of blind people who'd love to get online. 
Apparently the market mechanism failed to pick this up. 
And why should it? 
Obviously there's no billion dollar market in webpages for blind people so AOL doesn't care about it. 
Making their pages more accessible won't hurt them a bit so lets make them do it. 
Many people seem to have this naive idea that the market mechanism takes care of anything. 
Pure market mechanism is what rules animals. 
Big animals eat small animals and animals only work together if there's something to gain (evolutionary advantages for instance). 
A free market works in the same way. 
There's a small top of rich people who rip of the people who are less fortunate. 
A little regulation can fix some of the shortcomings and is crucial for the quality of life for the majority of the people. 
It wouldn't surprise me if AOL would be advertising its sites as friendly for blind people in a few months (after they loose the trial). 
I hope AOL loses and gets lots of negative publicity on this. 
It might cause other providers to act a little more friendlier towards their customers.

Fundamental problems in Web architechture?

Recently I tried to get a blind friend's computer to access the web in a blind-accessible fashion. 
I tried to do this with a screen-reader program, but a few major problems came up: when the text was in columns or frames, the reader software kept reading from left to right, mixing the two or more columns. 
Also, the screen reader could not decipher the graphical buttons that many pages use for even simple functions like "next" or "up one level." 
In addition, few web pages currently offer a text-only version of their pages. 
However, if someone on a PC goes to www.downloads.com, it takes them to the PC section, while a Mac automatically goes to the Mac section. 
This auto-redirection seems like it would be the perfect way to have two pages, one text-only and one graphical, and do it transparantly for both blind and sighted users. 
Do you think that such a standard for having two web pages will ever become commonplace?

What is so special about AOL (other than the obvious point that they are the biggest ISP). 
Is the lawsuit targeting AOL because they can afford a lawsuit? 
I'm just looking for understanding here, and being a bit critical of the situation in the process.

It may be cold-hearted for me to say this, but the question the lawsuit raises is "should websites be forced to be accessible by everyone regardless of handicap, or should those with handicaps seek alternative technologies / methods to combat their handicap?" 
I've designed a few websites right now and I'm naturally opposed to anything that increases my workload. 
I'm especially against such legislation being made against "corporations" because it will inevitably leak back to not for profits and then to personal pages. 
I know where you stand, and you know where I stand. 
My question is simple: Do you believe that handicapped people should first seek a resolution on their own, or should businesses be required to remedy the handicap themselves "Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?"

Is it correct to assume you 'read' pages with some text-tool not unlike lynx, and that us webdesigners could learn by looking at a lynxed page? 
If I look at slashdot with lynx I go insane, the sidebars of the central table are all filled with text which you hardly see when browsing with a graphical browser, but irritate the hell out of me when browsed with lynx (lots of extra text above and below the text). 
For my site, I check whether a user is using lynx and remove the sidebars, but only for lynx.

Have you read the provisions for disabled access in the CSS specifications, and if so, what do you think of them? 
How would you prefer to speed up adoption of these and other techniques, through legislation or education?

LK JAWS and failures (Score:1) by jake_the_blue_spruce on Monday December 06, @11:58AM EST (#71) (User Info) JAWS and similar tools seek to convert visual hypermedia into verbal. 
However, the meta data ("LINK") is distracting when communicated verbally, but essential to HTML capabilities. 
XML's linking behaviour is much more complex than HTML's. 
Won't it just be increasingly distracting and difficult to relate and then to navigate verbally?

-Cat Stevens technology, the handicapped, and police states (Score:3, Interesting) by / on Monday December 06, @12:01PM EST (#75) (User Info) One way to read history is to see that much of technology (specifically medicine) first arose in the treatment of disease and disabilities, and was then (or yet will be) applied in an Orwellian fashion to society as a whole or to "undesirable" segments of society. 
Lobotomies were first developed to treat schizophrenics and were later applied to common criminals. 
Eugenics as a social movement owes much (everything) to theories of Darwinian evolution and the discovery of genetically inherited traits. 
In the next century, many physical disabilities might be treated or cured with neural implants. 
Do you see cause for concern that as these technologies develop, they might reach beyond their originally intended applications?

I have spent a lot of time helping a blind college professor (and leader of the local chapter of the NFB) with his computers. 
He is quite an intelligent man and more computer literate than a great majority of the American public. 
I have noticed a few unfortunate things in working with him. 
First, it is difficult to get techinical support. 
Although not difficult work, most technicians are afraid of a computer that talks. 
Next, special hardware for the blind seems to be getting antiquated as companies turn more to software emulation that often does not provide the quality that is needed. 
Lastly, "special" hardware and software is often outrageously priced (such as OCR software) just because it is "for the blind." 
What would be the disposition of organizations, such as your own, to support and advocate Open Source computer accessability projects to help bring computing power to more handicapped people everywhere? 
I see this as a solution to a struggling cause.

I am talking about WAP and other wierd web appliances here. 
I did some work at uni on trying to stream information to different devices and the technical difference between a blind person and a WAP device is minimal. 
When I created web pages for my department I made dam sure the degraded after reading an artical about the dude who wrote speakEmacs. 
(Who is a very cool programmer, I want his kit so I can program in the garden!) Unfortunately this was before XML so they looked a bit crap! 
If the original information is in xml they it is easy for the web designer to provide a proper style sheet for display the information as required. 
(By example not using text buttons) Most really bug web sites now, for example CNN and BBC, store there files in back-end databases which then format the pages on request. 
This means that old pages take on any changes to look and feel.
