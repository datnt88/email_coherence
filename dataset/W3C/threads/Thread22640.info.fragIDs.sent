<s> Hi All, I have property file that would look like the one below.I  </s>
<s> wanted to load this into memory as a hierarchical Document Object preferably after converting this data into XML format.  </s>
<s> Do you guys have any idea about anything that exists that could help in this.  </s>
<s> menu.itemcount=3 menu.item.1.displaytext="Home" menu.item.1.url="../jsp/main.jsp"  </s>
<s> menu.item.1.child="home" menu.item.2.displaytext="Code Library" menu.item.2.url="../jsp/main.jsp?page=codelibrary" menu.item.2.child="codelibrary" menu.item.3.displaytext="Contribute" menu.item.3.url="../jsp/main.jsp?page=contribute" etc etc... Regards Pradeep  </s>
<s> Best of my information about DOM.  </s>
<s> The DOM is a tool for manipulating data, not a data structure itself.  </s>
<s> Is there anyway i can convert it to a java object or come up with an alternative.  </s>
<s> thanks, Andrew  </s>
<s> Hand-code a routine to read your property file and build a DOM representation of it, or hand-code a routine that will convert it to XML syntax and parse that into a DOM, unless you can find existing code that understands how to do this for you.  </s>

<s> Use JDom.  </s>
<s> It will handle anything that you need www.jdom.org  </s>
<s> What methods to be followed to be able to send a JDOM to the server using java RMI?  </s>
<s> Do I have to implement the java Serializable interface separately?  </s>
<s> Thanks Andrew  </s>
<s> A JDOM is not a W3C DOM (and even if it was, this list is mostly for questions about the API rather than about specific implementations of it), so you're asking in the wrong place.  </s>
<s> You might want to try the XML-DEV mailing list (see http://xml.org/xml-dev/index.shtml), or hit Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
