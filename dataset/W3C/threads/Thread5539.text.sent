Below is my action item: - SHAWN, by Tue 27 April late: send draft highlights and Tim's quote info to WSTF list Please comment TODAY per your action item: - ALL, by Wed 28 April: comment on stuff going to EOWG on Friday: purpose statement, Tim's quote, highlights ... so that I can meet my next action item: - SHAWN, by Thur 29 April: send stuff to EOWG list: purpose statement, Tim's quote, highlights Issue: Highlights on WAI home page WSTF is considering having highlights on the WAI home page. 
Purpose: - provide a space to address "hot" topics - provide a way to showcase different resources, since many people don't know what we have - make the home page more "alive" with timely topics that change frequently Examples of things that might go in highlights area: - blurb on newly finished documents, such as standards harmonization - XYZ government adopted WCAG, with a link to Policies - technique addressing hot issue - tip from a document, such as Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility, with a link to that document Notes: - would probably often have two highlights: 1. that stays longer and is a current high priority issue, such as standards harmonization, and 2, that changes more frequently, perhaps every week, such as a technique or tip - would not replace news/announcements as is currently on home page Issue: Quote on WAI home page The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web Question: On the new WAI home page, should this quote be: a. above the fold, b. below the fold, c. not on home page (on another page, such as Introduction to Web Accessibility or About WAI). 
Discussion: @@ ... doesn't say what WAI is about or what the site is about... was important when WAI started to give credibility &amp; that's not as important now... takes up fair amount of space and doesn't give a whole lot of "umph" if you don't know who he is &amp; many don't... [sorry, i'm too exhausted to do this now :-[ Note that what we need from you today is any changes or additions to below as what I will send to EOWG mailing list tonight (or tomorrow) for discussion on Friday. 
thanks Blossom, Thank you very much for replying! 
~ shawn Same for me - I couldn't think of anything for the last point. 
Carol Shawn, The topics for EO are well described - thanks for all your work. 
WRT 'Issues', I liked the suggestion from Charmane of one for "newbies" and one for "techies". 
WRT the 'Quote' - my vote is still for the home page, but at the bottom as a byline or similar Andrew "Shawn Lawton Henry" Sent by: cc: public-wai-eo-site-req Subject: clarification on RE: for EOWG - review Wednesday uest@w3.org
