For the last 24 hours www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de 
has been sending me a blank message very 20 minutes. 
Please can you get the program to stop sending me blank messages? 
Many Thanks Chris cbarham@rdf-consulting.co.uk*

I heard of that problem before. 
It seems to have something to do with badly formed URLs. 
As as there were no answers to my message on www4mail-comments about that concern (neither ACK, nor NACK), I now have to shut down www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de 
till the problem is fixed.

org'" www4mail-comments@w3.org , www-email-discuss@w3.org Well, I would like to have the following information: 1. 
Does the blank message contain ANYTHING ?? www4mail will not send out any mail message without the information page. 
Even if the information text is disabled by the user, there is a head line that contains the quota information. 
Last year, such problem were usually caused by the MTA and not WWW4MAIL . 
So please, someone kindly check if the messages have the same message ID and if the QUota information is the same on all message then an MTA somewhere is into a loop, it may not be www4mail itself. 
I think a good solution instead of shuting down the server would be to perform the following checks: 1. 
Using the mailq command, findout all mails queued for that particular user who complained. 
You can delete the ones that you find. 2. in the www4mail home directory, in the spool subdirectory, check if any files there contain the users e-mail address. 
E.g grep -i "onime@ictp.trieste.it" 
/home/www4mail/spool/* Once again you can delete such files but get back to me! 3. Just a hint, for your server ftp.uni-stuttgart.de, 
try to configure one or more swap files to provide about 3 times your normal RAM. 
Also, in your configuration try to turn off user single threading and/or configure the maximum spool age to be something like 1 hour, i.e Requests that cannot be served in one hour should be dropped. 
Also, enable www4mail daemon mode, if possible (just in case sendmail is continously feeding a single mail into different www4mail processes). 
I would like to say that there is a loot of defensive code against a single www4mail process getting into a loop. 
I believe that the 2.2 gateways have a parameter that ensures that after a single process has delivered a maximum of 10 mails, it would force an exit. 
So, the two probable options are A. the MTA is feeding the same message into different www4mail processes Cure: Enable daemon mode in the main configuration file place the following directive: DaemonMode 1 B. 
An MTA is delivering the same message to the end user. 
Here, one just has to trace how far the Mail travelled. 
Cure: I can't say right now. 
Okay, someone please send me a copy of the looping message!! 
I can be more definite after looking at the messages. 
Finally, I should apologise for my long absence, I was away on holiday! 
Christmas, New year ..... Okay, now that I am back, the www4mail site Administrator can be assured of prompt responses. 
Thanks Clement Onime
