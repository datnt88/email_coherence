Hello! The ability to annotate any WWW resource is wonderfull, but I have a question (possibly a FAQ): Is there a way to search for all web pages, which match certain conditions AND have annotations [on a set of annotation servers that this search engine accesses]? 
I.e. something like Google, but with a flag in advance search "Is annotated". 
While the amount of annotated pages is small compared with the total amount of the information on Web, I would very much prefer to be able to filter out pages that are annotated as opposed to look at all pages and see if they have annotations. 
P.S. The same question in broader scope would be: is there a search engine [like Google] to find all resources with RDF metainformation that matches selected criteria (i.e. describes object Person from a certain schema, etc.)?

Hello, 1- if you have a list of annotation servers and you know their protocol, you can get the list of annotations 2- if annotations are stored and published in a specific file format (you thought about RDF-XML), then a search engine could crawl the Web to find them: Google does that with PDF documents and Cora is a search engine to find research papers. 
3- if annotations are embedded into Web pages (for example an annotation would contain an XPointer), then you would have to crawl the Web and get only those XPointers. 
Search engines could easily do that. 
I personnaly like the 3rd solution: it lets users embed annotations in their current web pages: annotations do not have to be stored on a server or in a separate annotation file. 
Furthermore, you could send search engines the URL of your Web pagse containing annotations so they can directly process and include them into their database... 
I wrote a small proposal a few years ago about using extended URLs to encode an annotation (see .pdf) 
The idea was quite similar to what was also proposed later by Phelps and Wilensky for robust hyperlinks (see http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/papers/RobustHyperlinks.html) 
I can see uses of requesting annotations left by people on a specific text in a Web page (like a book you are about the buy on Amazon.com). 
What were you motivations? 
Do you have usage scenarios in mind?

Strange, the ability to create an annotation which can be associated with a page without having to be embedded or linked has always struck me as the key benefit of Annotea etc. Cheers, Danny. 
Danny, I'm not suggested to embed the annotation in the ORIGINAL document! 
I'm only suggesting to embed annotations within existing web page. 
The first step to do this would be that annotation servers give you a URL for each annotation, so you might safely embed it into your Web pages like this: a href="http://annotea.w3c.org/?command=get_annotation&amp;id=1254wssdf" 
my annotation /a Of course, this means that: - everyone has access to an annotation server to create new annotations - everyone trusts the web server (the server knows what you annotate) - people accessing your annotations need to access the server, so they ALSO need to trust the server - the server needs to be running So I was suggesting the second way: using "extended URLs" to encode the annotation itself: - the document it annotates (url) - the anchor point in this document - possibly the date, author, comment a href="http://www.w3c.org?anchor=word1+word2+...&amp;author=denoue&amp;comment=good+t hing" my comment /a To create such standalone annotations, you don't need an annotation server. 
Everyone can create its own annotations and embed them in their web pages. 
It's like creating a hyperlink: would you like to have to use a third-party server every time you needed to link to a particular page? 
Same thing with annotations... 
The third step then is to have a search engine (like today's annotation server) which crawls the web and identifies annotations, make them searchable, ... like annotea does today. 
But I think we missed the first two steps! 
Laurent.
