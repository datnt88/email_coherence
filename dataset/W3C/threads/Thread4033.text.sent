Class: Technical Section 15.1.11: 
Result type is prime type (sequences become list of unions) Michael: 15.1.11 is fn:distinct-values which accepts xdt:anyAtomicType* and returns xdt:anyAtomicType*. 
I'm afraid I don't understand the comment below and what to do with it. 
All the best, Ashok In order to be able to use fn:distinct-values in a statically typed implementation, it needs to determine its static result type based on its static input type. 
And the result is that it is the prime type/quantifier of the input type. 
See formal semantics.

All the best, Ashok Right! 
I'll add appropriate wording. 
All the best, Ashok its type/quantifier
