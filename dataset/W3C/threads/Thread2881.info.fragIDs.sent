<s> Hi, I too am interested in any information about conformance test suites for HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> I've recently been involved in a client implementation, and found planning the conformance testing a very manual task, mainly because I could locate no resource other than the RFC that listed (in brief!) which RFC MUST/SHOULD clauses apply to each class of application.  </s>
<s> It's interesting to contrast this with the WAP Forum's conformance specifications, which are found at the end of each of their specs.  </s>
<s> Furthermore there's a test suite produced and administered by OpenGroup.org which tests clients against each clause.  </s>
<s> I'd be very happy to discover that an organisation somewhere has produced a similar HTTP/1.1 client conformance suite.  </s>
