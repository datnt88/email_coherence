G'day all, I'm just getting to the end of an http implementation, and am in testing for conformance to the spec. 
I've interpreted the spec to the best of my ability, and I'd like to cross reference this list against another. 
Does anyone know the url to a document summarising the spec? 
This seems like such an academic exercise, I figured that there would be an .edu 
site with this info... Matt Lynch Developer Stimulus Solutions 
Hi, I too am interested in any information about conformance test suites for HTTP/1.1. 
I've recently been involved in a client implementation, and found planning the conformance testing a very manual task, mainly because I could locate no resource other than the RFC that listed (in brief!) which RFC MUST/SHOULD clauses apply to each class of application. 
It's interesting to contrast this with the WAP Forum's conformance specifications, which are found at the end of each of their specs. 
Furthermore there's a test suite produced and administered by OpenGroup.org which tests clients against each clause. 
I'd be very happy to discover that an organisation somewhere has produced a similar HTTP/1.1 client conformance suite.
