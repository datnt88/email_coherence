Here is a strawman formal comment from RDFCore to the TAG concerning the architecture document last call. 
I would like to decide by email that the WG approves sending this. 
Accordingly, I will send it on behalf of the WG if I hear sufficient specific endorsement and have no unresolved objections by Tues 23 Mar 2004. 
Brian RDFCore would like to congratulate the TAG for making an excellent start on documenting the principles that govern the design of the architecture of the web. 
We also recognise the great difficulty of the task the TAG has taken on. 
In response to the call for review of [1], several members of the 
RDFCore WG have submitted many detailed comments on the document [2][3] [4] which we hope the TAG will find useful. 
We are confident the TAG will give due consideration to each comment on its merits with or without specific endorsement by the RDFCore WG. RDFCore requests, however, that the tag pay particular attention to comments that relate to: - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions such as resource, representation, naming, identifying etc. 
- interpretation and use of fragment identifiers 
- notions of authority and ownership of URIs and resources We trust that the citation of the RDF Model and Syntax specification be replaced with a citation of the new RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax document [5] in due course.

My personal comments from early February: 0000.html (have no idea why they are not visible via the '2004JanMar' view...) Patrick Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com 
Thank you Patrick. 
I'm sorry for missing those first time round. 
I 
will add them to the list. 
Brian 
I approve in principle, and I think I approve in detail. 
My slight uncertainty stems from not being sure if the points to which you draw particular attention adequately cover the issues of reference and denotation that (I think) lay at the heart of the debate between Pat and TimBL (cited in my comments). 
I think your first such point: - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions such as resource, representation, naming, identifying etc. could reasonably be construed as covering this. 
If there is no further comment about this forthcoming, I suggest accepting your proposed text as it stands.

I am happy - I think the TAG have enough comments without us adding to them Jeremy 
nMar/0024.html [3] html [4] html [5] http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/ 
I'm also OK with the proposed draft, modulo the addition of the reference to my personal comments.

Brian-- I agree with the general idea of the comment, but I'd be happier with it if the bullet list of items that the TAG should pay particular attention to had an additional item along the lines of "clarifying the effects of allowing non-dereferenceable URIs (identifying such things as people) within the Web architecture" [wording could probably be improved]. 
I think RDF Core has a particular interest in seeing that, if there is to be a Web Architecture document, it go beyond the Web most people are familiar with, and deal more explicitly with issues raised by languages like RDF and OWL. 
This may have been part of the intent behind the first bullet, but I'd like to see it called out more explicitly.

Here is an updated strawman formal comment from RDFCore to the TAG concerning the architecture document last call. 
I have made the following changes to the previous draft: 1) Added the link to Patrick's comments 2) To address Graham's comment I've modified the second point to spefically mention reference and denotation. 
3) I've a new third point in response to the comment from Frank. 
I would still like to decide by email to send this by Tues 23 Mar 2004. 
I think I've heard support from Jeremy and Graham, and Frank and Patrick subject to satisfactorily addressing their comments. 
I've heard no objections. 
If Frank and Patrick are satisfied by the changes I think that is just about enough, though I would prefer more statements of support. 
I think we are on course to send this.
