<s> The Digest Access Authentication mechanism has been resubmitted to the HTTP working group for consideration for inclusion in HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> The boundary between HTTP-WG and WTS-WG is fuzzy in this area, but I would like to make sure that members of WTS-WG and the Security Area have an adequate chance to review and comment on security-related items in HTTP-WG documents.  </s>
<s> Does anyone believe that HTTP-WG should *not* proceed with digest-aa?  </s>

<s> Pages : 6 Date : 12/20/1995 The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0"  </s>
<s> includes specification for a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  </s>
<s> This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the network in an unencrypted form.  </s>
<s> A specification for a new authentication scheme is needed for future versions of the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> This document provides specification for such a scheme, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication".  </s>
<s> The encryption method used is the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm [3].  </s>
<s> Will this be available to people outside the US, or will the ITAR regulations mean that only those in the US can legally use it.  </s>

<s> ITAR does not limit authentication as much as encryption, (and MD5 code seems to be widely available), so I think this should not be a problem.  </s>
<s> Albert Lunde Albert-Lunde@nwu.edu  </s>
<s> Putting Albert Lunde's point more emphatically: since Digest Access Authentication does not provide confidentiality (doesn't use encryption) it doesn't fall under ITAR at all.  </s>
<s> -Allan  </s>
<s> Actually, I have one message archived that indicates that MD5 does come under ITAR - that all crypto comes under ITAR.  </s>
<s> I used to have another message tucked away, saying that authentication came under ITAR, but was far easier to get past the review, than is encryption.  </s>
<s> Yes, there is Much misinformation flying about ITAR - the messages I've seen in the past could be wrong, while Alan's is correct.  </s>
<s> If MD5 is used for auth, MD5 isn't just MD5 anymore - it's not just digests, it's authentication.  </s>
<s> Now the US goverment can be kind of wacked, but in an ideal world (gov't) they will judge a system based on the purpose to which the algorithms are being put - not the purpose for which the algorithms were originally intended.  </s>
<s> Note that it's also easy to turn MD5 into an encryption system, not solely into an authentication algorithm.  </s>
<s> This could explain why some have said that MD5 Is subject to ITAR.  </s>
<s> Again, however, since the intended purpose is only auth, it should not be subjected to encryption-style scrutiny, when reviewed for export.  </s>
<s> "Snefru" is widely available, tho probably not widely used, and uses MD5 for authentication.  </s>
<s> The US goverment does not appear to have gone after the author.  </s>
<s> I wrote a system using MD5 for auth, inspired by snefru, but I have no intention of allowing it off campus, at this point.  </s>
<s> :( All in all, ITAR just needs to die, or at least be thoroughly clarified and weakened.  </s>
<s> ITAR quite simply shackles US producers of cryptography (and hence, cryptography-utilizing software), while leaving numerous other countries running unfettered.  </s>
<s> Many times, I've considered writing cryptographic systems to give away on the net, and concluded I should allow someone outside the US to do it, so everyone could have access to it.  </s>
<s> Investors in crypto almost have to feel similarly (tho I personally don't care about commercial software as much as the body of free software out there).  </s>
<s> Please prove me wrong.  </s>
<s> I wanna be wrong on this one.  </s>
