<s> Consider the following: -These are NOT representative of what the site may end up looking like.  </s>
<s> -These are just for discussion and possibly for testing at CSUN. - Most text is "greeked" Feedback I am looking for: - Navigation - is this accurately labeled for now (came from Site Map - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/site-map)?  </s>
<s> - Font Size - should it be larger for testing?  </s>
<s> (When printed these are about the size of a piece of paper - 600 x 800) - General Comments on wireframes - Should I continue mapping out the tasks with this style?  </s>
<s> - I'm eliminating some tasks as I go because we won't be creating a full site - please give your advice on these as well.  </s>

<s> Carol, Thanks-a-million for keeping active on the task force and sending drafts to the list for comment.  </s>
<s> I think wireframes are jumping ahead a little too much at this point.  </s>
<s> Specifically, we need to agree on the content of the home page and navigation design before we start working on designs/wireframes.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we can get that going before CSUN.  </s>
<s> Note the "next Steps" listed at: Also, I think we agreed last meeting that we wouldn't be far enough along for actual testing at CSUN unless people were very prompt in completing action items and commenting on the list, which, unfortunately, has not happened.  </s>
<s> I'll send updated action items &amp; reminder for participation soon... Thanks again.  </s>

<s> CS: Card Sorting and the f2f will make it worth it - but testing would be great!  </s>
<s> I guess I'm still unclear about next steps.  </s>
<s> It looks to me that we have the basics to be able to go ahead and create the wireframes to check tasks.  </s>
<s> Obviously we cannot check actual content or navigation or design, but I thought it would be nice to see if tasks are able to be done with the names we have chosen and if documents are "findable".  </s>
<s> SLH: Hum - maybe we are not so far off, after all.  </s>
<s> I am used to using wireframes to test navigation and basic design.  </s>
<s> However, it seems like what you are looking for is testing/validating information architecture through tasks in addition to closed card sort.  </s>
<s> Is that correct?  </s>
<s> Well, that I think is more do-able at this stage (provided you want to put in the work to get it set up in the next few days :-\.  </s>
<s> I think that rather than using "wireframes" that introduce design complication, you could use just a simple outline - that is, having just the main 6 categories on the first page, and the sub-categories on subsequent pages.  </s>
<s> (Remember that these all need to be in accessible formats, e.g., accessible HTML.) One issue is that I think there are some pages for the tasks that do not exist - wonder if you came across that when thinking through the tasks and pages to complete them?  </s>
<s> What do you (ALL) think?  </s>
