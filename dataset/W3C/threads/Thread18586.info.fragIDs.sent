I have put a draft guideline dealing with ALT and description issues in This presumes only current technology; no changes in standards at all. 
There are some new issues introduced, e.g. sensitive maps and site indices.

Reply to: RE draft guideline Just a couple comments about Al's document: I agree strongly that all images should have a text description of some kind, be it separate or located on the same page. 
However, I think there are two categories of descriptions which should be considered: objective and critical (or interpretive). 
Objective descriptions simply provide information about what's happening in the image; they let the user provide his or her own interpretation. 
They are similar to audio descriptions used in movies and television programs. 
Critical or interpretive descriptions, on the other hand, can be used to provide either subjective opinion, where appropriate, *or* interpretive analysis which may not be immediately deduced from an objective description. 
One need not exclude the other: a chart or graph may require an interpretive description in addition to an objective one. 
I would think that, in most cases, an objective description would do the trick. 
However, I think these two types of descriptions should be kept separate. 
In other words, is it possible that some images will require two descriptions? 
Al, in your recommendations you state that links from from a description page back to an image should not be used. 
I've always thought that a "return" link from a description back to its image was a useful navigational aid. 
I also think that, in the case of an image map or other selectable image, a description which provides text links corresponding to the graphic links is a good idea. 
Am I misunderstanding your point? 
Can you elaborate? 
Thanks.

The (R1/2) in the Subject says that this is the first of two replies... 
This is really good. 
There are some rather fine-grain distinctions I want to clear up; we are real close. 
to follow up on what Geoff Freed said: 
First point: There are two possible interpretations of "linking to the image." 
One is to link via the URL for the image file. 
I tried to say people should do that. 
The other is to link back to where the image is used by an IMG tag in an HTML page. 
That is the return link that I am arguing against. 
This second kind of link would have to change every time you use the image in a different page. 
If the description is 100% about the image, then it can be reused unchanged along with the image. 
If there is a hypertext link back to where the IMG tag was, then the description document is locked to the page where that IMG tag appears and you can't re-use it. 
I am reacting, here, to some language that is in the San Jose guidelines. 
I may even have mis-interpreted it. 
But I read it to say "put a hotlink at the end of the description that takes the user back where they came from." 
I have had situations in the past where I got to coach people to put "use your browser BACK function to return to where you were" instead of a hard-coded hotlink so that a page could support multiple paths that lead to it. 
Second point: The idea of a text page which provides links covering "everywhere you can go from the Image Map" is a good idea to me, too. 
I tried to say every image map should have one of these, and furthermore it should always be what you get as the response to selecting the coordinates (0,0) or any other coordinates outside the sensitive regions. 
Eyeball-oriented authors may not want to define a DEFAULT response, preferring that clicking outside the intended sensitive areas be an error. 
In that case we may have to fall back to the idea that (0,0) is sensitive and goes to the text navaid. 
In any case I agree with you that this page should exist. 
Yet finer detail: I suggested that authors consider upgrading their images to sensitive status with one link from the default region to the description document. 
I would accept this as an alternative to linking from the text, if there is no natural home in "text that the author would have put on the page anyway" for a link to the description. 
Thank you for letting me try to clarify this.

Reply to: RE  draft guideline (R1/2) I get it-- if the same image is used on several pages, one single description at one single location will suffice. 
If you're linking to this single description from multiple paths, the "return" link isn't such a good idea. 
Your idea of "use your browser's 'back' function..." is good. 
In theory you *could* use a hard-coded "return" link if a description was used only once for only one image, but for the sake of consistency in design, I think I'd support the back-button idea for all descriptions.
