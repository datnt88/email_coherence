I've read the minutes and rough notes from the discussion at the IETF. 
Apparently some people feel that properties will usually be meaningful only in the context of a specific protocol, or in the context of a whole family of other properties. 
I don't agree with the conclusion. 
One argument summarized by (but not necc. 
endorsed by) Jim W is 2) There was also concern that DAV properties may not exist independently of other protocol elements, and hence registering just properties may not be enough. 
For example, it is possible to define a long-time-duration RPC mechanism using properties. 
For example, client A stores a request in a property, then waits. 
Next, client B retrieves the request from the property, executes the request, then stores the result back in the property. 
Later, client A goes back to retrieve the result. 
In such a case, registering the property isn't sufficient, since what is really going on is a protocol. 
This is, frankly, an abombination. 
Has't Yaron lectured to us often and forcefully about the evil of writing to properties for side-effect? 
yes, what's going on is a protocol, and yes, in such a case you could not understand the property without the protocol. 
but the fact that one can misuse WebDAV in this way is no argument against a registry for the common and reasonable case where one is not abusing it. 
I see no reason not to have a registry of properties. 
It can't hurt. 
At worst, it will be useless. 
At best it will be very helpful. 
I disagree that Dublin Core properties must be taken in an all or none fashion to be of any use at all. 
note that DAV already defines dav:displayname, which is remarkable similar to the Dublin Core title property. 
The property registry is a no lose situation. 
In the worst possible case, the information stored there is useless (Well I suppose in the truly worst case, the information stored there is treacherously misleading, and exploited by crackers or terrorists.) In the best case, it gives us a place to share useful common definitions. 
If there's no better forum for this registry, why not allow it to go forward? 
sorry if Ive missed the point. 
Jim I haven't seen an argument against establishing one. 
Instead, the issue seems to be that people want to see it organized around schemas rather than individual properties. 
So: I'll set up a registry at www.webdav.org. 
People can register schemas and properties. 
Of course, you will also be able to get a flat list of properties :-) Oh, and "registry" may be a bit strong... it kind of connotes a requirement that people register the properties they use. 
Anybody have a better name for a place where people can place their information, for simple communication/documentation?

Um... "The World Wide Web"?
