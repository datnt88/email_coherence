<s> I am strongly supporting SD1 - Short End Tags, primarily with respect to the useage of XML to exchange databases.  </s>
<s> In some examples from my desk - we are exchanging data for engine management system - I was saving 40% size of the instance by simply shorten the end tags.  </s>
<s> Making Perl hacker?s  </s>
<s> life easier is ok.  </s>
<s> But if such kind of programs want meet the requirements of error reporting (WF errors) they still must track the element names.  </s>
<s> There was a proposal to allow Short End Tags in Elements with PCDATA only.  </s>
<s> I think this is hard to keep sure.  </s>
<s> Therefor, I hereby propose, that Short End Tags are allowed in valid XML-Documents.  </s>
<s> In this case, it causes no more effort to read the document, since there is a validating parser.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the database people need a Database scheme, so that they will work with valid XML-document primarily.  </s>

<s> This sounds a bit like "I really want smaller heads on these hammers you're selling -- I'm using them to turn screws and they're just not very efficient."  </s>
<s> Usually if 80% of your files is markup (roughly that, since by shortening half the tags you say you're saving 40%), there's a bigger problem going on.  </s>
<s> The biggest savings come if you've got a whole lot of little tiny fields.  </s>
<s> Little tiny fields seldom have much internal structure; we're usually talking about integers, dates, social security and phone numbers, etc.  </s>
<s> In such cases, you're a whole lot better off sticking them in attributes.  </s>
<s> Conceptually, it makes at least as much sense; and attributes are good at reprenting little chunks of info that each have little internal structure; and SGML and XML can validate a number of datatypes for attributes (and, perhaps will add a few), whereas it is not possible even to require that #PCDATA content *exist*.  </s>
<s> To me, the big problem is not that you have to give the GI twice.  </s>
<s> It's that you have to give it on every *instance*, which simply doesn't make sense for RDBs.  </s>
<s> If you're shipping 100 records with 10 fields each, you don't want to just get from 2000 GIs to 1000 GIs.  </s>
<s> You want to get to 10 GIs.  </s>
<s> The total costs for different forms, given an n-char GI are:  </s>
<s> gi /gi or 5+2n chars per field gi / or 5+n chars per field gi/ / or 3+n chars per field gi=" " or 5+n chars per field |gi or 1 chars per field.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm an incorrigible CS nerd, but I find O(k) a lot better than O(n), and O(n) not very much better than O(2n).  </s>
<s> You can save the 2n vs. n amount just by shortening GIs, and most modems will compress it away anyway.  </s>
<s> Doesn't seem worth it, esp.  </s>
<s> since we have a known constituency that it will hurt (the DPH, not the parser writers, of course).  </s>
<s> Saving part of the end-tag is just a patch; if we really want to address this case we should save an awful lot more than that, and it seems to me that is best done some more radical way if at all.  </s>

<s> The more I look at the arguments, the more convinced I am that XML is not likely to be a meaningful format for distributing database-resident bulk data.  </s>
<s> This shouldn't surprise anyone: it was never designed to do this.  </s>
<s> You want to ship bulk data, you send a Java applet followed by a gzipped datafile, and let the applet generate XML locally for the display.  </s>
<s> ///Peter  </s>
<s> I do not think this to be the case.  </s>
<s> You can use XML to mark up database records for distribution/interchange, in which case, one would (intuitively) expect that any compression applied would result in a file little different, because the markup would tend to form a very regular input pattern (easily compressed).  </s>
<s> To test this, I performed another little experiment.  </s>
<s> I created a 1024x1024 table of (random, integer, small) numeric data in both comma delimited, and xml form, and then compressed both files.  </s>
<s> The results follow: Before compression: foo.txt 11,873,460 foo.xml 17,123,519 Markup adds about 44% to the size of the data.  </s>
<s> After compression (using gzip): foo.txt.gz 5,323,235 foo.xml.gz 5,704,385 markup adds about 7% to the compressed size.  </s>
<s> This gives me pause.  </s>
<s> I now wonder precisely which applications it will be good for.  </s>
<s> If all you are doing is sending XML to the display, HTML works pretty well for that.  </s>
<s> So what I get from XML then, is a display format with more complex hyperlinking?  </s>
<s> no.... len  </s>
<s> Gavin, doesn't this look pretty much like the arguments in VRML about the binary formats in which it was decided that modems and gzips did the job about as well with regards to transmission size.  </s>
<s> I don't think I buy  </s>
<s> the "transmission size will be a hazy memory" argument because even where complete infrastructure change is needed (why not dump TCP/IP while at it?), it won't happen too quick and in all of the places XML should be able to reach.  </s>
<s> I think it likely to happen to the well-heeled in the short term, but that's life.  </s>
<s> OTH, reduction of end tagging just isn't an issue with enough arguments one way or another to convince me that it requires a lot of time right now.  </s>
<s> I think it should be reconsidered in XML 2.0 if there is sufficient evidence it gives the application vendors grief (such as, they ignore it and do it anyway).  </s>
<s> BTW: On conformance.  </s>
<s> Anyone looking at that issue now should look at Mary Brady's site for VRML 2.0 at NIST.  </s>
<s> Top marks!  </s>

<s> [shipping bulk data]  </s>
<s> No, I don't see that conclusion follows at all.  </s>
<s> You can build into the applet whatever smarts you want: all I'm saying is that shipping bulk data premarked in plain XML (or SGML) is inefficient.  </s>
<s> Having a  </s>
<s> dynamically-generated chunk of JavaScript unwrap and rejig a dynamically-composed chunk of data in some highly compact (?binary) format might overcomes the transmission problem.  </s>
<s> The XML which hits the browser should be the same as if it has been composed and transmitted _en clair_.  </s>
<s> ///Peter  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> I think you could define a binary form that would be *smaller* than anything you can prodice with gzip et al., but that should not have any effect of the textual representation --- an in particular, the argument for empty end tags.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Like VRML, even when compressed, at some point, a binary has become necessary.  </s>
<s> But an applet?  </s>
<s> I can see that approach working in the way a self-contained compress/decompress works.  </s>
<s> Umm... the browser?  </s>
<s> Just what is that?  </s>
<s> I know what a framework is, and a framework + plugin = browser.  </s>
<s> I'm unclear about the dynamically generated chunk of JavaScript is needed.  </s>
<s> The XML hitting the browser is still data to some process, right?  </s>
<s> What is that process?  </s>
<s> What is it's application?  </s>
<s> Probably we should take this over to xml-dev.  </s>
