<s> Regarding Phill's issue discussed in today's teleconference: 8: flicker (eliminated by WCAG 2.0 reorganization?)  </s>
<s> This issue is not closed by the new reorganization.  </s>
<s> These comments were made on the 8/2002 draft and proposed that the minimum and Level 2 success criteria for checkpoint 2.3 (Avoid causing the screen to flicker) should be moved to level 3. In the 6/2003 draft, the previous Level 2 success criteria have been moved to Best Practice so that part of the issue is resolved.  </s>
<s> But the previous minimum success criteria are now the required success criteria so this part of the issue is still open unless we are confident that this is a testable success criteria.  </s>

<s> I think there are two issues here.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The success criterion says that content "is not designed to flicker or flash...".  </s>
<s> If "not designed to" is interpreted to mean "does not contain markup, code etc., for the purpose of causing it to flicker", then I can think of no reason why that wouldn't be testable.  </s>
<s> 2. There is a separate issue regarding patterns etc., that do not amount to flicker but can cause seizures, into which, as I remember, Gregg is hoping to conduct research.  </s>
<s> This aspect of the problem currently isn't covered by our checkpoint and does raise "testability" concerns.  </s>
<s> Thus I think the current success criteria are testable as long as we interpret "is not designed to" as suggested.  </s>
<s> Issue 2 (in the above discussion) would in that case still be open though.  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>
<s> Well sort of doing research on patterns.  </s>
<s> What I'm doing is researching the research.  </s>
<s> But yes - more when I get more.  </s>
<s> Be a little while but no toooooo long.  </s>
