Regarding Phill's issue discussed in today's teleconference: 8: flicker (eliminated by WCAG 2.0 reorganization?) 
This issue is not closed by the new reorganization. 
These comments were made on the 8/2002 draft and proposed that the minimum and Level 2 success criteria for checkpoint 2.3 (Avoid causing the screen to flicker) should be moved to level 3. In the 6/2003 draft, the previous Level 2 success criteria have been moved to Best Practice so that part of the issue is resolved. 
But the previous minimum success criteria are now the required success criteria so this part of the issue is still open unless we are confident that this is a testable success criteria.

I think there are two issues here. 
1. 
The success criterion says that content "is not designed to flicker or flash...". 
If "not designed to" is interpreted to mean "does not contain markup, code etc., for the purpose of causing it to flicker", then I can think of no reason why that wouldn't be testable. 
2. There is a separate issue regarding patterns etc., that do not amount to flicker but can cause seizures, into which, as I remember, Gregg is hoping to conduct research. 
This aspect of the problem currently isn't covered by our checkpoint and does raise "testability" concerns. 
Thus I think the current success criteria are testable as long as we interpret "is not designed to" as suggested. 
Issue 2 (in the above discussion) would in that case still be open though. 
Comments? 
Well sort of doing research on patterns. 
What I'm doing is researching the research. 
But yes - more when I get more. 
Be a little while but no toooooo long.
