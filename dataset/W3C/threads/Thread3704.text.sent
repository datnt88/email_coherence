It is not a feature. 
I am afraid, but I am going to miss the call today. 
Attached please find the latest overview.xml that I have. 
I am still having a difficulty on uploading the file. 
Addison/Martin, it would be great if you can upload the file for me. 
There hasn't been much progress made on the file, and it's because I have been sick pretty much for the past 2 weeks. 
It's just a cold, and not even a flu, but I haven't been taking days off shortly after our previous conf call. 
Truly sorry for the delay that I am causing here. 
-takao I'm sorry to hear you are under the weather. 
I corrected some parse errors in your document and have uploaded both XML and HTML versions to the website. 
Martin and I will work to correct your upload problems as soon as possible.

[today] Note: We published Requirements as a Working Draft today (17th) Note: Tex, Martin and I updated the draft of Usage Scenarios significantly. 
The document contains many revisions and much of the redundant text was removed. 
If you're missing your favorite paragraph, that's where it went. 
Most editing occured before section 4 of the new document. 
FTF planning: Addison to post information about the webMethods site (whereabouts, hotel information, etc.) on the website. 
Discussion: We discussed plans to do some more editing of the Usage Scenarios document in small groups. 
In particular, Tex and I are planning another edit-fest online over the holidays, using WebEx as a 'digital whiteboard'. 
Andrea will review sections 1- 3. Other text contributions should be sent to the list as text. 
We discussed the issue of editing in XMetal, which can be excruciating at times. 
We need others to commit to reviewing sections or providing missing text. 
PLEASE read the new draft.
