<s> Comments on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 W3C Working Draft 5-November-1999 5.8 Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings.  </s>
<s> In particular, follow conventions for user interface design, default keyboard configuration, product installation, and documentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] This should be Priority 1.  </s>
<s> I have conducted accessibility audits of many software packages that break conventions for user interface design.  </s>
<s> Almost always, non-standard interfaces create accessibility nightmares.  </s>
<s> A product with non-standard keyboard mappings may be in some sense ?accessible,? but it will probably be so unusable that it is, in effect, inaccessible.  </s>
<s> The ability to install ?  </s>
<s> or reinstall ?  </s>
<s> software is vital.  </s>
<s> A product that cannot be independently installed is not accessible: if you can?t install it, use can?t use it.  </s>
<s> Similarly, a user who cannot get at documentation may not be able to use it at all.  </s>
<s> 10.3 Allow the user to change and control the input configuration.  </s>
<s> Users should be able to activate a functionality with a single-stroke (e.g., single-key, single voice command, etc.).  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] This is not clear.  </s>
<s> The second is really a subset of the first, but I suggest presenting them as two points: 1.The user should be able to customize the means by which control and input are accomplished.  </s>
<s> This should be Priority 1.  </s>
<s> I have seen lots of software rendered inaccessible because important features are not readily available.  </s>
<s> It is common to find important accessibility features poorly documented or undocumented.  </s>
<s> 2.The user should be able to activate any feature with a single keystroke, button press, or voice command.  </s>
<s> This is Priority 2. 10.8 Allow the user to configure the graphical arrangement of user interface controls.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] This should be Priority 2. In accommodating people with learning and cognitive disabilities, the ability to rearrange the interface is sometimes key ? the strategy that renders the interface accessible and not.  </s>

<s> - Judy Yes, it was.  </s>
<s> Two other points: There should be clearer reference for the need for logical tab order (generally top to bottom, left to right) when navigating through a user agent screen by keyboard.  </s>
<s> How about something about ensuring that focus indicator is visible AND conspicuous at all times?  </s>
<s> The lack of conspicuous focus indicator is a big barrier for people who are sighted and who rely on keyboard-only access.  </s>
<s> If the operating system does not provide it, then the user agent should.  </s>
<s> (Two examples of exemplary focus indicators: Opera highlights the hypertext links in focus.  </s>
<s> The default keyboard shortcut in Windows 95/98/NT for task switching is Alt + Tab.  </s>
<s> This pops a window showing tasks, the one with focus surrounded by a well-defined blue box.  </s>

<s> unquote one of the things i asked for at the last User Agent Face2Face meeting was an impact matrix for W3C markup languages, showing user agent manufacturers how much could be gained by simply implementing all of HTML4, all of CSS2, and so on, so as to illustrate to UA developers just how many of the features and functionalities for which we are asking could be satisfied simply by implementing existing specifications that have already undergone extensive accessibility reviews... your concern is something that could easily be rectified by full support for stylesheets, although i'd like to see UA manufacturers that operate in a graphical environment develop some sort of Wizard interface that a user (who knows nothing about CSS) could use to build and tailor a stylesheet that is appropriate for his or her needs, rather than on a decision made by an individual or small team of developers and applied in a cookie-cutter one-size-fits-all manner... the decision on how best to highlight hyperlink text is best left to the user, which is why i champion the "add full support for CSS1 and CSS2 and you can satisfy the lion's share of checkpoints in the UAGL" point-of-view... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
