<s> A possibly simplistic view of the matter: Good software warns users if it is going to open a new window.  </s>
<s> Bad software doesn't.  </s>
<s> If the author does not provide a warning, then users of bad software suffer.  </s>
<s> If the author provides a warning, then users of good software suffer.  </s>
<s> Thus author provided warnings encourage users to choose bad software (or to use good software but disable that good feature).  </s>
<s> This increases the number of users using bad software and the demand for authors to continue to punish users of good software.  </s>
<s> What's more - say a user is using a windowless browsing environment (such as lynx).  </s>
<s> Any such warning would be untrue as javascript and target attributes can't make new windows open.  </s>
<s> David Dorward  </s>
<s> Oh, It gets more complex than that.  </s>
<s> This implies that old is bad and though that may be a way to think, it is not necessarily true.  </s>
<s> It is also true  </s>
<s> that there are windowless environments out there but people who use them know that they are using them so the fact that a link presents its self as opening in a new window would be known as a nonsequetor in that environment.  </s>
<s> The benefit you achieve is that it does not actual harm to let people know.  </s>
<s> Yes, it can be redundant in the best of environments, but it does harm to  </s>
<s> some if the fact is not disclosed in advance.  </s>
<s> A possibly simplistic view of the matter: Good software warns users if it is going to open a new window.  </s>

<s> David Dorward  </s>
<s> It shouldn't imply that.  </s>
<s> All that should be implied is that software which fails to provide a warning is (in that respect) inferior to software which does.  </s>
<s> It might not cause harm from a point of view which strictly considers accessibility, however it does: * Increase work required from the developer * Increase (very slightly) bandwidth and data storage requirements * Provide false information to some users * Provide duplicate information to some users I would consider all of the above 'harm', although perhaps not to accessibility.  </s>
<s> As Phil Jenkins said - the information that a new window will open is already available to the user agent.  </s>
<s> It has been that way since it was possible for an author to prompt the browser to open a new window, and user agents which take advantage of this information already exist.  </s>
<s> David Dorward  </s>
<s> Removing the argument that people should change browsers, systems or other technology for a moment, I want to explain a bit about harm.  </s>
<s> Harm to the user and this is what we are talking about here is something that causes something not to be known.  </s>
<s> The author does not have to code links that open in a new window.  </s>
<s> That is a choice.  </s>
<s> If there are no links that open in new windows, there is no extra burden on the author.  </s>
<s> While I do understand that this decision may not have been made by the author but by someone directing the development, the fact is that it is an authoring responsibility.  </s>
<s> Now, what harm does it do to anyone who uses the site?  </s>
<s> It is useless information to some granted, but that is not harm.  </s>
<s> It is miss information to some but that can be corrected if you want to expand the phrase or you can rely on the user's understanding of their windowless environment to compensate for this mit of misstrivia.  </s>
<s> If it is duplicative, it only serves to doubly emphasize the point and may be a bit annoying but does not result in the lack of information that not using it would result in for some who need it.  </s>
<s> As for bandwidth, Alt tags in and of them selves consume some bandwidth so we need to take that into account when making this argument if we make it at all.  </s>
<s> It shouldn't imply that.  </s>
<s> All that should be implied is that software which fails to provide a warning is (in that respect) inferior to software which does.  </s>
<s> It might not cause harm from a point of view which strictly considers accessibility, however it does: * Increase work required from the developer * Increase (very slightly) bandwidth and data storage requirements * Provide false information to some users * Provide duplicate information to some users I would consider all of the above 'harm', although perhaps not to accessibility.  </s>

<s> title simply provides additional information about the element.  </s>
<s> The full definition is as follows: This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it is set.  </s>
<s> Unlike the [96]TITLE element, which provides information about an entire document and may only appear once, the [97]title attribute may annotate any number of elements.  </s>

<s> There isn't a single standards-compliant Web developer who uses title attributes who uses them only that way.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Moreover, one qua author cannot *know* what will happen when a user follows a target=_blank link, even when the user's navigating with a windowing browser, since no normative specification mandates how a browser *must* behave upon its user activating a target=_blank link [1].  </s>

<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-frame-target ).  </s>
<s> Note the key word "should", which ought to be interpreted according to RFC2119.  </s>

<s> Neither of those apply on the WWW as a whole, which is a heterogenous browsing environment.  </s>
<s> Accessibility warnings serve to help document authors ensure they cater for all readers - including minorities to whom none of a set of specific situations (such as you enumerated) apply.  </s>
<s> OTOH that particular warning may(?) have outlived its usefulness now that browsers in real life give their users more control.  </s>
