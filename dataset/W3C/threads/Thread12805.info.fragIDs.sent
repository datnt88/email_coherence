<s> aloha, jonathan!  </s>
<s> sorry for not getting these out to you last week, when you posted the URI of your slideset to the EO list, but i've been having serious computer problems that have left me with only the spottiest of connections, and only the most tenuous hold on my digital data... in any event, for what they're worth, here are my comments: aloha, jonathan!  </s>
<s> good job, but i do have a few suggestions 1. technical suggestions 1A. it is not clear from the ALT text that the links which are defined as back and forward arrows actually move one backwards and forwards through the slide set... perhaps you could reinforce this point by adding simple prefixes to the ALT text for each button, so that anyone who isn't capable of perceiving the back and forward buttons as iconic representations of backwards and forwards movement, instead of seeing/hearing the ambiguous: Mission Some Questions for You which sound as if they are simply hyperlinks on the page that lead elsewhere on your site, the textual alternative would clarify that the resources to which they point are part of the presentation... Previous: Mission Next: Some Questions for You 1B. use stylesheets, rather than a universal H1 to control the font size for the slide as a whole... currently, each slide contains two level one header declarations -- one which forces the entire content of the page to be rendered using the browser's default style setting for level one headers, and one (unclosed) level one header to indicate the topic of the individual slide... misuse of structural markup is a very bad idea for 3 reasons: (1) it violates WCAG; (2) it decreases user control over the presentation of content; (3) it may interfere with the proper rendering of the page (both from a visual and non-visual viewpoint) -- if you'd like, i can work with you on this (i've already started to play around with one or 2 of the slides) 2. content questions 2A. on page4.html  </s>
<s> (the fourth slide in your presentation, entitled "Why Bother With The Web"), you state: quote The web is icon and image based.  </s>
<s> unquote the web is neither icon nor image based, and i'm not sure that that is exactly what you meant -- could you not, instead, stress that the web provides individuals with the capacity slash option to operate in an iconic and image-based modality?  </s>
