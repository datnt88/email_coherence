<s> Open Alta Vista page with Amaya works fine.  </s>
<s> Querying Alta Vista from there returns the Alta Vista page in another windows instead of the answers.  </s>
<s> Hello Anne Marie, In our previous episode, Anne Marie Vercoustre said:  </s>
<s> Yes, it's a known limitation.  </s>
<s> It happens because Amaya opens a new window if you modified the current document (to avoid your losing your modifications).  </s>
<s> With forms it's the same: type in some text in an input zone, and Amaya thinks the your document has been modified.  </s>
<s> This is something that will be corrected soon.  </s>
<s> Hope this is of help, -Jose  </s>
<s> Maybe Amaya needs to have to concept of a write-protected page?  </s>
<s> And since "write-protected" is not one of the attributes returned on a page, maybe you want to use a regexp to set this attribute.  </s>
<s> If it's a page off my server, I can modify it.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it gets set to write-protected.  </s>
<s> By the way, I've got an edit.cgi and edit-upload.cgi,  </s>
<s> which let you upload pages to a server.  </s>
<s> Might this be useful to the Amaya project?  </s>

<s> Hi Russ, The problem I described about forms is not the one you're talking about :-) Rather, it comes from the duality of having both an editor and a browser.  </s>
<s> Where's the line separating those functionalities?  </s>
<s> Actually, the solution is not very complicated, but requires some time to think about what's the best way to program it.  </s>
<s> Anyway, this limitation will be soon eliminated.  </s>
<s> An easier solution: let the user toggle at will between browser and editor mode.  </s>
<s> I wrote a PUT script which you can access from the Amaya user's manual [1].  </s>
<s> I am currently revising it to make it HTTP/1.1 compliant.  </s>
<s> How do the scripts you propose differ from a PUT script?  </s>
<s> What's the difference between edit.cgi and edit-upload.cgi?  </s>
<s> I propose we take this script track of the Amaya list and use instead some person-to-person email between you and me.  </s>
<s> Cheers!  </s>
<s> -Jose  </s>
<s> About the same as the difference between vi and view.  </s>
