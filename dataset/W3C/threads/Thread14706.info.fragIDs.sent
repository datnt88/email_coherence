<s> The state of Texas is doing a good thing by setting accessibility standards: http://www.dir.state.tx.us/standards/S201-12.htm  </s>
<s> However, they're also doing a bad thing by believing that the only challenge that needs to be addressed is accessibility for blind users: (5) Generally accessible Internet site -- A state Web site that: (A) complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for persons with visual disabilities promulgated by the W3C; (B) contains no priority 1 errors; and (C) complies with HTML standards published by the W3C.  </s>
<s> Policies of these kind scare me because they represent a fundamental misunderstanding of what we're all about, which suggests that we (WAI participants) may not be doing our jobs effectively.  </s>
<s> It is worrisome that people think of accessibility as ONLY visually impaired users.  </s>
<s> We need to make sure that people with a wide variety of disabilities are "visible" in whatever we produce.  </s>
<s> I think we're doing that now, but if so, we still need to look at why misinterpretations happen anyway.  </s>

<s> It's really not so much a fundamental misunderstanding as an under-understanding.  </s>
<s> Here's my quick analysis of why WCAG is associated with the blind: - Blind advocacy groups are among the most prominent supporters of WCAG, particularly respecting commercial web sites; - Visually-impaired users stand to benefit the most from WCAG-compliant sites; - More needs to be done for visually-impaired users in WCAG 1 than any other category; - The checkpoints relating to vision are most often normative, and thus more compatible with law.  </s>
<s> And why other disability categories are generally ignored:  </s>
<s> - The progression of web development has meant text before sound, and as a result hearing-impaired users are impacted less often; - Motor-related disabilities are generally more extensively supported by assistive technologies than by content modification; - Cognitive disabilities are nearly impossible to articulate in the time necessary to "sell" accessibility; - Disabilities not related to vision and hearing in particular are not understood, and therefore, it is difficult to prove value to an otherwise uninterested party.  </s>
<s> I agree that the bias toward vision exists.  </s>
<s> Still, I can't fault the framers of WCAG for that bias.  </s>

<s> Kynn, I hate to be the one to say it, but this is exactly what I said would happen when I first came on this list two years ago, and now it is happening.  </s>
<s> Not just in Texas, but on the site the feds are making for how to's - it is stated that these accommodations are aimed at the visually impaired disabled.  </s>

<s> Each time we waste a week or two letting the new guys spout off and pick on Anne, we lose another week of solving the real problems.  </s>

<s> What is my argument?  </s>
<s> To include the cognitively disabled in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Is that such a bad thing?  </s>
<s> Seems to have been.  </s>
<s> Now it's clear we may have missed the chance to include these folks in government guidelines (when accessible government sites are the most important and least useful at present) ... It's looking like my time with W3C has been mostly wasted.... Thanks, Kynn, for bringing this to our attention.  </s>

<s> Now, I'm confident that EO is well-versed in making the argument for all forms of disability, but if visually-impaired users are the easiest for people to conceptualize, and it causes accessibility as a whole to gain traction, so be it.  </s>

<s> Anne, a rising tide lifts all boats.  </s>
<s> This has been my core value all along.  </s>
<s> I am not as concerned with perceptions related to disability and accessibility as I am with checkpoints that cannot reasonably and provably be satisfied, and the experience here in the U.S. shows that the legislators who have adopted portions of WCAG 1 agree with me.  </s>

<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> That's because we ask web designers to accommodate the blind in the guidelines but then don't do much for anyone else with needs.  </s>
<s> Why would you pick something so obscure?  </s>
<s> Why not mention the needs of the cognitively disabled to have illustrations on the government sites so they can understand the information there?  </s>
<s> Actually, as Kynn's post pointed out, other needs are being shut out by this "misunderstanding" .... but is it really a "misunderstanding", and what are we going to do to fix it?  </s>
<s> More than anything else, I am striving towards a "reasonable document" but we are miles apart on our perception of "reasonable".  </s>
<s> It's really very simple to make the document "reasonable".  </s>
<s> Say the page must be illustrated.  </s>
<s> How much is enough?  </s>
<s> Well, one would be better than none (since it would give the disabled user a clue what the page is about so they can decide if its worth trying to read).  </s>
<s> So one is your measurement point.  </s>
<s> Simple.  </s>
<s> Sure someone could wiggle under the guideline by including a graphic of text that would pass a Bobby Test for a graphic.  </s>
<s> But someone could just as easily wiggle under the guideline by including a " " as an alt tag for something that needed words.  </s>
<s> Actually, what I see happening is that if accessibility butts into the intended content, the content wins out over accessibility .... that's why is so difficult to find "accessible" multi-media on sites ... it's there, or it isn't, almost never does it have all the baggage that the guidelines say it must have ... And, no, I don't think it's really going to work to say if we accommodate the blind, we can slide the rest in behind.  </s>
<s> Look back in a history book and see what happened to the women and Indians who helped win the vote for the former slaves ... It was decades later before the women got their right to vote, and later still for the Indians.  </s>
<s> No, that's a slippery slide that worries me, even if I consider the faster time frame now than then on rights issues .... Seriously, Matt, we need to move forward on these issues instead of spinning philosophical and sociological cobwebs ... Put some thought to the idea of one per page/document as a bare minimum, full illustrations should be in accordance with the purpose and audience of the page/document/site as a whole.  </s>
<s> Once we say they must be there to pass accessibility, then we can begin to study the ways to help content developers and page designers make a well-illustrated page accessible to everyone .... Anne Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com  </s>
