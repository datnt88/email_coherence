<s> Alt keys are used for the accesskey function in html documents.  </s>
<s> Some are also used for shortcut functions in the editor.... To resolve conflicts may I suggest that editor mode be used... Editor mode on --- invoke any shortcut assigned to an alt key.  </s>
<s> Editor mode off -- (assume browsing) -- do accesskey if used.  </s>
<s> This would also allow more edit shortcuts based on alt key These may be required once more mathml pallettes available.  </s>

<s> There is an entry in Special/Preferences/General that allows you to ignore accesskeys.  </s>
<s> It would be helpful if this were a shortcut that could easily be switched (like browser/editor mode) so that people who want accesskeys can use them.  </s>
<s> They are reasonably likely to be the same people who are relying on keyboard shortcuts instead of using a mouse, in many cases.  </s>
