Hi I've been involved in developing a web based document creation and management tool, MKDoc [1]. 
I was wondering if anyone on this list would like to get an account [2] and try creating some web pages and give me any accessibility feedback. 
We have tried to comply with WAI WCAG and WAI ATAG wherever possible.

Hi all, 
I am not trying to speak for everyone else here, but I wold think that the more the merrier! 
I would love to help someone else in this field, 
so Chris, please send me the details. 
I am a busy person, but I am willing to provide you with some feedback on your product as much as possible - and there are plenty of people in my office who will help me do that (I work for a multimedia company). 
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future, and I will do my very best to provide you with constructive criticism. 
Kind regards Simon Behalf Of Chris Croome Hi I've been involved in developing a web based document creation and management tool, MKDoc [1].

If https access is a problem I could set up a http interface.
