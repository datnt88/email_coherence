<s> Hello, [I just hit the send button by mistake on an incomplete mail....let's try again...] I have just read most of the 18 Aug 2003 draft of the OWL Guide [1], which I found very readable and helpful.  </s>
<s> I have a couple of questions on minor editorial points.  </s>
<s> 1) Subsections of 3.4 are numbered; subsections of 3.3 are not.  </s>
<s> I think those of 3.3 should also be h3 numbered headers.  </s>
<s> 2) Under 3.3, inverseOf, "z" is mentioned in the first sentence (before the colon) but is not used in P1(x,y) iff P2(y,x)  </s>
<s> 3) Under 3.3, inverseFuntionalProperty, on the other hand, "z" is not used in the first sentence but does appear in P(y,x) and P(z,x) implies y = z.  </s>
<s> It looks as though the first sentences were switched...  </s>
<s> 4) The first few paragraphs of section 4 (Ontology mapping) seemed to cry out for at least a mention of namespaces.  </s>
<s> This comment is not that important, but if there is more information in another document about ontology sharing, a reference to it would be helpful.  </s>
<s> 5) I think the second example in section 5.1.2 deserves more explanation.  </s>
<s> Section 5.1.1 is about intersections.  </s>
<s> The example in 5.1.2 refers to the "intersection of sweet and non-sweet fruit," but the intersectionOf operator that was just introduced is not present.  </s>
<s> I see from section 3.1.1 that "Instances of the class belong to the intersection of the restrictions [that appear in the class definition]."  </s>
<s> That subtle point is lost in the wake of 5.1.1.  </s>
<s> In fact, would the example in 5.1.2 be better off in section 5.1.1?  </s>
<s> Also, the example revealed to me that I do not understand why rdf:resource is used in some cases and why rdf:about is used in others.  </s>
<s> The topic is introduced in 3.1.1,  </s>
<s> but I don't get a good understanding of the difference there.  </s>
<s> The Guide says that rdf:about is used to "extend the definition of a resource."  </s>
<s> However, I don't see any extensions going on in the example in 5.1.2.  </s>

<s> I agree, not sure what historical artifact led to that.  </s>

<s> I see what you are saying.  </s>
<s> The intent here was to be fairly abstract.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I should be more explicit in the example.  </s>
<s> I talk about the food and wine ontologies and use the &amp;vin construct but without explicit reference to &amp;food.  </s>
<s> How about modifying the second paragraph of 4.1 from One way to do this is by defining a class in the food ontology and ... to read One way to do this is by defining a class in the food ontology (&amp;food;Wine) and ...  </s>
<s> I thought the point was fairly clear.  </s>
<s> But I have been staring at this document for a long time.  </s>
<s> 5.1.1 states that The construction above states that WhiteWine is exactly the intersection of the class Wine and the set of things that are white in color.  </s>
<s> 5.1.2 states This says that the instances of Fruit are a subset of the intersection of sweet and non-sweet fruit, which we would expect to be the empty set.  </s>
<s> The reason to pull this example into the unionOf discussion is that some people have misinterpreted the implicit combination of the two subClassOf's.  </s>
<s> The other point is that this second example is not definitional, and the text is an explicit reminder to the reader of the difference.  </s>
<s> As well as the difference between this construct and that in 5.1.1.  </s>
<s> There is some confusion in my text.  </s>
<s> The "extend the definition" text is meant to differentiate rdf:ID and rdf:about.  </s>
<s> And rereading it, I don't think that is clear, given how rdf:resource is used in the middle of the text.  </s>
<s> I suggest changing: Within this document, the Region class can now be referred to using rdf:resource="#Region". to Within this document, the Region class can now be referred to using #Region, e.g. rdf:resource="#Region".  </s>
<s> The id/about distinction is that rdf:ID is meant to be used in the initial introduction of an element and rdf:about is used to elaborate on it in a further description.  </s>
<s> rdf:resource is used in a property instance, typically to identify the range element.  </s>

<s> Ok.  </s>
<s> There should be some explanation about why rdf:about is *preferable* to rdf:ID.  </s>
<s> In particular, the TAG's Architecture Document promotes web-wide linking, and I think rdf:about fits better than rdf:ID.  </s>
