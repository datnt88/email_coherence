<s> Checkpoint 10.2 has labels preceding fields, which make obvious good sense for text fields.  </s>
<s> However, for radio buttons and checkboxes, which one can think of as "bullet" controls because they look like bullets, Chuck's curriculum example has the label following the controls.  </s>
<s> See Question: do we change the checkpoint or Chuck's example?  </s>
<s> I think we should consider switching to what Chuck has for bullet style controls.  </s>
<s> The first reason is that I think first of all that we'll get pushback from designers if we want them to reverse the order.  </s>
<s> Second of all, since most pages have the fields following bullet style controls, it could be that people using screenreaders are accustomed to it, even if it's non-optimal, and it would actually be confusing to change.  </s>
<s> Eventually, when user agents support associations between form controls and labels, the position will not matter.  </s>
<s> I suggest that so few pages will go with the order we recommend before that time, that we change the recommendation or possibly downgrade to priority 3 for checkboxes and radio buttons.  </s>
<s> What do folks who use screenreaders think?  </s>
<s> Please note that I am not suggesting this order for text fields.  </s>
<s> Only for bullet style controls.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'll be talking with a bunch of webmasters monday.  </s>
<s> I'll let you know what they think.  </s>

<s> I agree with Len.  </s>
<s> I think we would be better off requiring consistent positioning.  </s>
<s> The checkpoint itself requires proper positioning, but hte explanatory text says the the label must be above or before the control.  </s>

<s> It's sort of funny that the only explicit reason I had for placing the  </s>
<s> labels after the "bullet-style" controls was to have the controls and the  </s>
<s> text align nicely without having to resort to a layout TABLE or trying to figure out how to use CSS that would work across the major browsers.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, I think the order of placement suggested in the  </s>
<s> checkpoint is valid for text boxes and for controls if the author puts more  </s>
<s> than one control/label pair on the same scan-line, so I don't think the checkpoint should be changed.  </s>
<s> However, if there is only one control/label per line, I think the ordering is unimportant since the control and label are associated by default.  </s>
<s> To maintain internal consistency with the guidelines, I guess I should move the labels to the other side of the controls (lead by example!).  </s>
<s> Either that, or I could add a comment to the slide (or an associated page) explaining why I chose the placement and why it is not necessarily a bad thing.  </s>
<s> I look forward to hearing what Len's colleagues have to say about this.  </s>
<s> By the way, in this case an automated accessibility validation tool hard-coded to the checkpoint would indicate an access-error when one does not really exist, although I suppose a rule could be written to test for the exception.  </s>

<s> Putting a control label above the control has serious problems for users of older screen readers.  </s>
<s> This is only marginally acceptable, and then only if there is no more than one control on line following label.  </s>
<s> Expansion: The first-level of display scope in the screen reader is the highlighted text of the control with focus.  </s>
<s> In some browsers this will include the label.  </s>
<s> That is good style.  </s>
<s> The label should share the highlight when a control gains focus.  </s>
<s> The choices of reading scopes in the screen reader are roughly: the screen reader reads all in document serially, just the current line, or just the current focus-or-other-highlight.  </s>
<s> To get from a checkbox to the label in the _previous_ line the user of the screen reader has to back up _twice_ in searching for better context.  </s>
<s> Once to read the whole line, and then to read more than the current line.  </s>
<s> Checking the previous line will be an arcane trick of the trade.  </s>
<s> Next natural level of retreat above "read the whole line" is to start over at the top.  </s>
<s> A really bad scenario is the defacto table with multiple labels associated  </s>
<s> with multiple controls by layout artifacts.  </s>
<s> Neal, have I got this pretty much straight?  </s>
<s> Forcing the label to come before a checkbox or radio button has serious drawbacks in terms of visual values.  </s>
<s> Lining up a set of parallel clickables in a column aids usability.  </s>
<s> We need to compromise better here.  </s>
<s> Consider FatLinks in User Agent as a better fix.  </s>
<s> Steve McCaffrey is interested in accessible forms.  </s>

<s> Al  </s>
<s> Hi Al, yes, this is much of it, but, depending on the age of the screen reader being used, it is actually worse than even you implied.  </s>
<s> The thing the screen reader user who is using an older screen reader also has to do to read the label above the focus is to some how change reading sources.  </s>
<s> One is tabbing to the items in focus with what could be called the application cursor or whatever is following the focus.  </s>
<s> But when one gets to a focus area, it is then necessary to begin reading the text, with the (mouse pointer or screen reader review) cursor either line by line, by word, by character, etc. as you pointed out.  </s>
<s> As one tabs to a new focus area, the mouse pointer or screen reader review cursor is probably nowhere near the area of the screen which currently has the focus.  </s>
<s> In newer screen readers, this is not a large problem although it is sometimes tricky.  </s>
<s> there is, however, a reasonable expectation that one can route the mouse cursor to the area of current focus.  </s>
<s> In some older screen readers, this is not nearly as easy.  </s>
<s> Thus, when one tabs to some area of focus and then wants to read the line above that focus, one has to first find the text in question from perhaps a good ways away.  </s>
<s> After reading all the text necessary to allow one to discover where they are and where the focus is, it is likely that most persons will have their concentration totally shattered and they will be lucky if they can even remember what they were looking for in the first place.  </s>
