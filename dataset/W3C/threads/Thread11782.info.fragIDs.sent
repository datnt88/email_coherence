<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Why I think it is a checkpoint:  </s>
<s> Including pre-written descripitions, which are generated by professionals, will provide a high-quality text ready-made.  </s>
<s> This significantly reduces  </s>
<s> the energy required of the author to improve the accessibility of the page by adding the description, and is likely to result in high-quality descriptions becoming standard.  </s>
<s> It doesn't stop people from writing better ones, merely provides a high 'clearing-floor level'.  </s>
<s> There are various ways that the information could be included, for example having a searchable database of images and descriptions, including them as 'summary information' in the format of the data itself, (GIF allows this - it is generally only used for making animated gifs, or providing image libraryies which came with a URL for each image that was a description of the image in some central registry.  </s>
<s> (This doesn't work offline, but does allow online users of the image to have the description cached, and therefore promotes the use of the image.  </s>
<s> Good for marketing, bad for people who like indivduality).  </s>
<s> Those methods are what I would consider techniques.  </s>

<s> I would argue that it is almost a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints should be in the approximate form of "provide this functionality."  </s>
<s> It should be obvious from the checkpoint what abilities the checkpoint provides.  </s>
<s> Hence, this isn't quite there yet.  </s>
<s> It is an arbitrary statement that you should "do this," without any explanation of why or to what extent.  </s>
<s> It also doesn't define what a "professionally written" description is: what profession?  </s>
<s> How detailed should the description be?  </s>
<s> The statement might be rephrased along the lines of: Provide a text-based means for the end user to determine the content of multimedia files (e.g. clip art).  </s>
<s> This phrasing would state the intent of the checkpoint, and be based on functionality.  </s>
<s> The technique associated with this checkpoint might be something like "Provide grammatically correct and descriptively accurate text documents and/or meaningful filenames that describe multimedia files.  </s>
<s> Now, on the other hand, is this the responsibility of the user agent?  </s>
<s> Do user *agents* include clip art and other multimedia files, or do they just render them?  </s>
<s> It seems pointless to require an agent to generate a description of files that come from elsewhere.  </s>

<s> Denis, I did not include the entire text in my message.  </s>
<s> I was hoping people would refer to the present draft which has more of an explanation, justification and description of what needs to be done.  </s>
<s> The primary points here is that we are talking about the prepackaged media including clip art that are shipped with the authoring tool.  </s>
<s> The action we want is that they come with professionally written alt text and descriptions.  </s>
<s> This is an authoring tool developer action.  </s>
<s> Anyways, please refer to the present draft for clarification.  </s>

<s> Actually I see this referring more to text used as longdesc than as alt.  </s>
<s> Using 'search', 'home', 'site index' etc should be a no-brainer.  </s>
<s> Appropriately describing my wife's painting of our apartment, which doesn't actually look quite like our apartment, is a whole different kettle of fish.  </s>
<s> Similarly for video description and such.  </s>
<s> I will happily write alt text, and descriptions for reasonably simple technical drawings, but interpreting artworks is something I find very challenging (and also lots of fun - in my spare time I love it).  </s>
