<s> Comments? Marja 4.8 Allow the user to configure the position of captions on graphical displays.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques: Normally the position of the captions window is defined by the author or the default user agent settings.  </s>
<s> However, sometimes the captions are disturbing as they are placed on top of information that the user wants to see.  </s>
<s> Especially, this might be the case when the user has low sight and has enlarged the caption text.  </s>
<s> Also the size of the user's screen may vary so it is not always possible to place the captions outside the video or other windows and sometimes the user may need to adjust the position of the caption window just because of her preferred way of organizing the space on the screen.  </s>
<s> There are several ways how to implement this.  </s>
<s> Easiest from the user point of view is if the user agent can allow the user to drag and drop the  </s>
<s> captions to a place on the screen like any other window.  </s>
<s> If the author is using stylesheets for positioning the captions an overriding stylesheet need to be defined.  </s>
<s> Most probably a user would also like to store the default positioning for the captions e.g. always under the rest of the presentation.  </s>
<s> In many cases, the user agent probably needs to allow the positioning of any region of the presentation as it is difficult to separate when the region contains captions and when not.  </s>
<s> Here is an example of how the layout can be defined in SMIL 1.0 [http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access/#Layout].  </s>
<s> Thanks to David Poehlman's comments I added some more alternatives to drag and drop.  </s>

<s> One comment, though, is that if the author codes the captions correctly (using the system-captions test attribute) there is a reliable way to know which parts of the presentation contain captions.  </s>
