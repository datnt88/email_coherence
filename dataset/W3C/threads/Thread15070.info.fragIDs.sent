<s> Sorry It just takes finger spelling movements and displays them as letters.  </s>
<s> So it lets you spell out words.  </s>
<s> It doesn't detect or translate ASL.  </s>
<s> Could be very nifty as a keyboardless keyboard though for those who know finger-spelling and can communicate well by spelling out words.  </s>
<s> Could also be used for data entry.  </s>

<s> There was a similar project a few years ago at Latrobe university to read a glove... (there are different sign alphabets in different languages) Actually there are a number of intersting projects in this area - I think the most interesting are the ones that create signing avatars.  </s>
<s> The basic problem is that there is no written form of sign languages (except things like signed english - where english words are represented by sign language - not the same thing, and I think not even internationalised across english-speaking countries - the sign alphabets and languages used in Australia are very different, like greek and french are different) so each project needs to work on a way of solving that.  </s>
