<s> 1. Drag and drop image/HTML files into browser to view (and in the case of HTML to edit).  </s>
<s> It works in IE, Frontpage Exploder, Netscape, and Netscrap Composer, why not Amaya?  </s>
<s> (This might not be implementable in Unix/X, only Win32 platforms...oh well.  </s>
<s> Better some than none.)  </s>
<s> 2. Help doesn't provide full coverage of all aspects of Amaya2.0a that are non-intuitive (e.g. how to work around the lack of a symbol-entry palette for special characters and apparent incompatibility with Windows charmap.  </s>
<s> And how *do* Unixies manage it without anything even resembling charmap?) 3. Color browser doesn't want to open in 2.0a.  </s>
<s> E.g., in structure view, select a body and attribute menu, item bgcolor.  </s>
<s> You get a text entry dialog.  </s>
<s> Unless you're a real whiz-zoom and know hex codes off by heart for your favorite colors, this is worthless without a color-picker dialog.  </s>
<s> 4. Table edit is crufty in Amaya 2.0a.  </s>
<s> Specifically, one situation that is tricky is changing two columns on a row to two rows with one column each.  </s>
<s> Cut either td element.  </s>
<s> Then make a new row, paste the td into it.  </s>
<s> It should do what you want but fails, for Amaya pastes in your cut td, and then adds a second, blank td for no reason.  </s>
<s> (Stray CR/LF in the cut?) To make the table neat and rectangular, it adds a td on the other row too.  </s>
<s> This would be okay except that it adds it *before* the pre- existing td.  </s>
<s> Now you have a table like a checker-board.  </s>
<s> You can't delete either blank td.  </s>
<s> The only workaround seems to be splitting the whole table in two (with copy/paste) and then copying their lone tr/td/stuff and pasting as two rows into a *third* table and deleting the first two.  </s>
<s> 5. There appears to be a memory leak with image manipulations.  </s>
<s> Large leak, very dangerous.  </s>

<s> In the specific csse, you want to cut the content of the TD not the TD itself.  </s>
