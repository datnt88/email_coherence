XHTML attributes aren't supposed to have any whitespace in them. 
I'm just looking for some verification on the idea that if I use the title attribute, then I need to encode the whitespaces between the words, correct? 
So if I have title="A new link." 
I should code that as title="A#x20new#x20link." And this would not affect accessibility I hope.

Whatever gives you that idea? 
Whitespace is fine.

Which is stupider: Pop-up ads claiming they'll stop spam, or spam claiming it'll stop pop-up ads?

It actually says to strip trailing and leading whitespace in the attribute value. 
So I guess whitespace within the attribute value would 
be OK. Randal Rust Covansys Corp. Columbus, OH 
I assume you read point 4.7 of http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-20000126/#diffs 
"In attribute values, user agents will strip leading and trailing whitespace from attribute values and map sequences of one or more whitespace characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space (an ASCII space character for western scripts)." 
and subsequently followed on to read http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#AVNormalize 
I have to admit, I had to read that last one a few times as well, but if I'm not mistaken the crucial point is this: 
"the XML processor must normalize the attribute value" 
In other words: you, as web author/developer, can use whitespace as usual. 
It's the XML processor that needs to then (internally) convert all whitespace characters until they meet those requirements. 
You can write your titles as normal, i.e. title="A new link." 
At least, that's what I understood. 
Somebody please slap me in the face with a big salmon if I'm talking nonsense.

It says that user agents (e.g browsers) strip them, not that you should not include them while you're creating the document.

P.S.: oops, ended up putting the URL of the old recommendation in there. 
Right, it's the last time I'm using Google to find something at the W3C site... Apologies if that caused any confusion, Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford
