<s> XHTML attributes aren't supposed to have any whitespace in them.  </s>
<s> I'm just looking for some verification on the idea that if I use the title attribute, then I need to encode the whitespaces between the words, correct?  </s>
<s> So if I have title="A new link."  </s>
<s> I should code that as title="A#x20new#x20link." And this would not affect accessibility I hope.  </s>

<s> "In attribute values, user agents will strip leading and trailing whitespace from attribute values and map sequences of one or more whitespace characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space (an ASCII space character for western scripts)."  </s>

<s> "the XML processor must normalize the attribute value"  </s>
<s> In other words: you, as web author/developer, can use whitespace as usual.  </s>
<s> It's the XML processor that needs to then (internally) convert all whitespace characters until they meet those requirements.  </s>
<s> You can write your titles as normal, i.e. title="A new link."  </s>
