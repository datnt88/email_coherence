<s> Currently we have a single href attrribute.  </s>
<s> We must continue to allow that simplicity.  </s>
<s> URL syntax may not be much good, but it is _not_ going away any time soon.  </s>
<s> Any multiple attribute solution will be _additional syntax_.  </s>
<s> If we are going to add syntax, it must enable something that would _could not_ do without that syntax.  </s>
<s> All the arguments we have had about convenience have not yet shown such an advantage.  </s>
<s> This is where we fundamentally disagree.  </s>
<s> The URL syntax does not describe a "single attribute".  </s>
<s> It defines a set of components and shows how they can be concetenated into a single string that must be decomposed on receipt into the component parts, each of which must be processed separately.  </s>
<s> The href attribute is simply a container in which the concatenated parts of a URL are transmitted.  </s>
<s> Do not confuse the transmission container with the contents of the envelope.  </s>
<s> What I am arguing for, as a devil's advocate, is the adoption of a cleaner, if slightly more convoluted, design that recognizes the fundamental differences between the component parts of a URL and allows them to be managed separately.  </s>
<s> So you are arguing that we should eliminate the "single URL syntax" altogether?  </s>
<s> I think that that would be suicide for the levels of HTML  </s>

<s> different but familiar-seeming; same low-level options remain almost as easy as they are in HTML).  </s>
<s> If we change the syntax of simple direct links we will lose  50% of our authoring audience right there.  </s>
<s> There will be no or few special XML tools until there is a proven market, so that they don't help with _intial_ acceptance.  </s>
<s> The "take your medicine, it's good for you" marketing approach is not a good one.  </s>
<s> What is at question is whether pre-decomposition would offer any advantages.  </s>
<s> I'm not certain it does, but I want these points to be seriously thought about before we go blindly down a route that does not bring the gains that existing web masters are desperately seeking and which someone else will provide soon if we do not.  </s>
<s> Its a question of marketing.  </s>
<s> If XML is proveably safer to manage (note I did not say easier) then it will have a much much better chance of being accepted outside of the existing SGML community.  </s>
<s> I think that we have something better: a management technique involving entities that enables such "provably safer" management, and does _not preclude_ the easier and compatible "href" linking-style.  </s>
<s> We could use locsrc to get the same effect, but the combination of equivalent power, additional verbosity, and an extra incremement of implementation difficulty seems to argue against it.  </s>
<s> I tend to think that the kind of guarantee that you are asking will appeal more to "the traditional SGML community" than to the webmasters that I've met.  </s>
<s> People like extra power, but they don't like having to unlearn things they already know (like hrefs).  </s>
<s> I'm done with this thread.  </s>
<s> I think we don't need additional syntax to enable the functions you have convinced people would be good; no one else seems to be listening; we agree on the arguments, and on the issues, but disagree on the final solution.  </s>

<s> What I'm suggesting is that we should add facilities in addition to the ones now available on the web to allow web managers to do what they cannot do with HTML _if they so wish_ or to carry on in the uncontrolled way they currently do if they are happier to work that way.  </s>

<s> I'm listening and I agree with David.  </s>
<s> Priorities as I see them are a. provide the ability for it to be possible to create a well-formed XML instance that can be dealt with by existing HTML browsers (or with very minor mods to allow browser makers to claim some degree of XMLness - it may be important marketing-wise for them to be able to say this); b. provide the ability for conformant XML instances to use much more sophisticated facilities, at the penalty that these will only work with four-wheel browsers.  </s>
<s> (I don't happen to believe that we need to provide for badly-formed instances.)  </s>
<s> At some stage soon we are going to need a lucid and explanatory middle-ground document which explains what we are doing (and why XML is A Good Thing) for the consumption of webmasters and webmistresses who don't have the time or knowledge to go through the spec in detail, and it should include an even shorter and even less technical summary for the use of managers who simply want to be persuaded that this is something they need to ask for.  </s>
