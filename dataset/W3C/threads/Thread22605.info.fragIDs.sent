<s> Hi all I was wondering if there was a canonical list somewhere of browsers that support DOM Level 1+.  </s>
<s> I know Mozilla browsers, Opera, and Internet Explorer support it to varying degrees, but I was curious if there were any others that I may not know about.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> There's a partial list of DOM resources, including implementations (and including browser implementations) at This isn't edited by the DOM WG, and we haven't tested these for compliance (note that a test suite is under development now) so no endorsement is expressed or implied.  </s>
<s> If there's something which ought to be listed there but isn't, I'm sure the page's editor would welcome contributions... Hm.  </s>
<s> The page is currently reporting "This category needs an editor".  </s>
<s> Public service opportunity, if someone has a few spare cycles... Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
