<s> well Graham, it is just a rdfs:Resource not a rdfs:Class nor a rdf:Property kind of an individual being a rdf:List and lowercase is OK I would say Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>

<s> Suggest we keep whatever it is now.  </s>

<s> nil is an odd case: its the only non-property and non-class thing with a name in RDFS.  </s>
<s> So the conventions don't apply to it properly.  </s>
<s> I'd rather leave it lowercase, however, else people will think its a class.  </s>

<s> It isn't a class; or at least it wasn't till this week; it now might be rdf:type rdf:List.  </s>
<s> Can we batch up all these proposed renamings and terms moving namespaces?  </s>
<s> I've seen: rdfs:XMLLiteral (rdf:type rdfs:Class) to rdf:XMLLiteral rdfs:Datatype (rdf:type rdfs:Class) to rdf:Datatype rdf:nil (rdf:type rdf:List) to rdf:Nil I want to see compelling reasons to do any or all of these proposed changes.  </s>
<s> So far, I'm not convinced.  </s>

<s> I thouhgt DanC gave a good reason to use rdf:XMLLiteral so I switched to that one (sorry Pat, forgot to mention that in my recent e-mail message Re: rdfs closures) I don't see reasons to change rdfs:Datatype and rdf:nil Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
