A question about path expressions: 
"/" is a legal expression 
"/ + 5" also seems to be legal so, "(/) * 5" is probably legal "(/) div 5" likewise what about "/ * 5" or "/ div 5" 
Do we require spaces? 
Or parentheses? 
Or does an xpath parser need to look ahead to distinguish these cases? 
(My vote is for parentheses). 
Thanks, jeff

My understanding is that we require parentheses, but I'm not sure this is 
clearly documented. 
The examples above are actually all legal in XPath 1.0, 
which has a known bug in that it doesn't describe how to disambiguate these 
cases. 
Fortunately none of the above examples is likely to appear often in 
real code. 
In XPath 2.0, though, it becomes more likely: for example "if (/ is $n)" needs to be written as "if ((/) is $n)", or perhaps as "if (/. is 
$n)". 
Or you can always write root(.)!

I have an action item (ACTION-Gaith-6) to clarify this in the documents 
for the next pub, though it should be theoretically unambiguous from the lexical state tables. 
"/" does not recognize operators (i.e. symbols recognized in the OPERATOR state) immediately following it.

I would prefer to have this stated explicitly in the grammar than to have to find it in the lexical state tables. 
(In fact, I suggested in another thread that the lexical state tables be removed from the document, in order to force the grammar to be complete and consistent by itself.)

Yes, I agree completely, I did not mean to infer otherwise. 
This has been discussed by the WG several times now. 
So far, we've opted to keep it, and keep it normative -- implementors have found it useful, and no matter how detailed we are in the prose, the tables do clearly disambiguate the grammar in a declarative fashion.
