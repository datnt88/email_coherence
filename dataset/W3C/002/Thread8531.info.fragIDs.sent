<s> I've accumulated a few things to say regarding identifiers, resources, and signatures.  </s>
<s> I hope this is useful to you.  </s>
<s> How do you make an assertion sans location semantics, such that: B: some object when found and transformed yields the following DigestValue ?  </s>
<s> I think this is a valid question.  </s>
<s> We have a requirement to identify objects via URIs.  </s>
<s> The URI need not be a URL.  </s>
<s> (In fact, I think the DigestValue is a good URI).  </s>
<s> Technicality: A digest value by itself may not be a URI, strictly speaking, unless it includes a prefix of the URI scheme name followed by a ':'.  </s>
<s> But a digest value could certainly be used in a URI.  </s>
<s> In order to talk about some object to be used in creating a digest value (or for any other purpose), there must be a reference to that object using one of three kinds of methods of referring to the object.  </s>
<s> (1) A URI (either URL or URN - no real difference in this regard, as argued below).  </s>
<s> (2) Some expression for how to obtain it by some other means, probably grounded in URIs.  </s>
<s> (3) The object may be available as immediate data, such as embedded in the same XML document as where it is being used.  </s>
<s> URIs are the preferred means for referring to things on the internet but other kinds of things might be translated into URIs (such as XML element names, or ID attribute values).  </s>
<s> Referring to immediate data is also relevant, especially when signing data if you can't trust the validity of references or resolution mechanisms.  </s>
<s> But now to the question of whether a digest value could be used in a URI as a reference an object from which you want to compute the same digest value.  </s>
<s> That *could* be done, but it seems at least suspicious if not spurious.  </s>
<s> Seems you want an independent way of referencing the object so that you can verify that the digest value is valid.  </s>
<s> However, an independent reference to the object is not necessary if it is computationally infeasible to get the same digest value from any other content.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, a digest value that is used in a URI is not particularly useful, to say the least, as a hint for resolving the URI to get the content.  </s>
<s> The namespace of all digest values is globally flat, so resolution would have to be very centralized, which is unscalable.  </s>
<s> Hence the idea of a Location hint.  </s>
<s> But, it might be that a new URI scheme could combine persistent location hints and a digest value to get the best of both.  </s>
<s> So we should not presume any particular characteristics of a URI only knowing it is a URI.  </s>
<s> It may or may not be a persistent or unique identifier for a static or dynamic resource.  </s>
<s> Moreover, the terms "URL" and "URN" don't offer much clarification, even though the *intent* of a URN is that it is persistent.  </s>
<s> [...] We could relax that requirement and remove "Location" from the signature and only provide it as a resolution hint;  </s>
<s> I think it is better to just say "URI", avoiding the confusion of whether or not it can be used as a location.  </s>
<s> we permit a level of indirection pre/post signature creation.  </s>
<s> Pre: ObjectReference uses some mechanism such as a directory, URN, manifest etc. that provides resolution.  </s>
<s> Post: you allow a "redirect" or "cache" statement to be associated with the signature that states "the URI found in ObjectReference resolves to X"  </s>
<s> Some applications may need to sign and later validate the invariance of the relationship between a URI and the content it references.  </s>
<s> P3P as currently specified (http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-P3P-19991102) is an example; it requires that the URI for a privacy policy be invariant with the content of the policy.  </s>
<s> Allowing this invariance to be signed is different from requiring that all URIs used in signatures be invariant, however.  </s>
<s> I don't believe such a requirement is useful and it would overconstrain the possible uses for XML digital signatures.  </s>
<s> We could assume that some particular URI scheme would maintain that invariance for you, but the very same signing and validation would have to be done somewhere else instead.  </s>
<s> So one way to allow the invariance to be signed is to package up the URI with the digest of the content obtained by resolving the very same URI (no matter how it is resolved) and sign that package.  </s>
<s> If the URI resolves to something else, or if the thing it resolves to is different in any way (as determined by comparing with the digest value) then the validation would fail.  </s>
<s> That is what we would want for P3P.  </s>
<s> Verifying the invariance of the relationship between a random number URN and the content of the resource would involve the same process I outlined above.  </s>
<s> The randomness of the random number URN only makes collisions unlikely but does not guarantee no one has abused the relationship.  </s>
<s> A random number URN doesn't help much with resolution either.  </s>
<s> What to do with redirections and other intermediate status (e.g. metadata of various sorts) is a good question, even when you are merely validating a signature involving resolution of any URIs.  </s>
<s> Or equivalently, use a URL in a way that ignores the location hints contained in it, which is perfectly valid.  </s>
<s> Just because a URI says "http:" doesn't mean you (a client) have to use HTTP to resolve it.  </s>
<s> Somehow you need to use a reference associated with a document to get the document, no matter what you call that reference or how it is resolved.  </s>
<s> Whatever it takes to stop being confused about URL vs URN vs URI... Validating that you've got the right content when the content can change is a more difficult problem.  </s>
<s> Has it been considered?  </s>
<s> In that case, you have to validate that you have the right service that is giving you the content.  </s>
<s> It is probably not enough to let the service do the validation of the signature for you unless you trust you are talking to the right service, in which case you might as well trust that you will be given the right content.  </s>
<s> Or maybe you trust that it is the right service but sometimes it screws up.  </s>
<s> Same thing: you can't really trust it.  </s>
<s> You also may not trust something between you and the service.  </s>
