<s> I think it might be useful to identify the potentials uses to which the specifications developed by this group could be put as, it will help us identify requirements,and start of by suggesting a couple - I am sure there are others ... PUBLIC CHOREOGRAPHY DEFINITION This use of a choreography definition would allow standards groups to define "Public Choreographies", for example RoesttaNet to define their PIPs, or, organizations like UN/CEFACT to define standard public choreographies for international trade.  </s>
<s> The main benefit of standard choreographies would be that software vendors could build solutions that could then be used directly for B2B with less adaptation.  </s>
<s> As a result the cost of doing B2B would go down significantly.  </s>
<s> However if you follow this through this requirement through, it leads to a couple of additional requirements on the way in which choreographies are defined, including:  </s>
<s> 1. Detailed message format independence.  </s>
<s> Business documents necessarily vary in their structure, for eaxmple: a) Invoices in the US include sales tax whereas in Europe they contain VAT, or b) line items on travel related invoice could contain flight segment information.  </s>
<s> This means that the choreography defintion should be independent of any specific document format.  </s>
<s> 2. Service implementation independence.  </s>
<s> The same choreography must work no matter who has implemented the services that generate and accept the messages in the choreogrpaphy.  </s>
<s> This means it should be possible to define a choreography independently of the WSDL.  </s>
<s> RUN-TIME CHOREOGRAPHY CHECKING A choreography definition should be usable at run time to check that an implementation is generating and receiving messages in the correct sequence.  </s>
<s> Since successful B2B is completely dependent on following a choreography correctly, then being able to check that messages are being sent in the correct sequence is independent.  </s>
<s> If this can be done by interpreting the choreography definition, then it allows new definitions to be implemented with confidence.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>
<s> Any other ideas?  </s>

<s> Are we expanding the scope to encompass the complex business processes, evident in B2B or bounding what we can realistically accomplish?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I am not suggesting that we define complex business processes (e.g. how to place an order), I am suggesting that we define a language that allows others to define these processes.  </s>
<s> I also think that this realistic to accomplish.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> As you says, message format can vary.  </s>
<s> I hit on another problem.  </s>
<s> I wonder what to do if we need to use the value of the tax variable to contorol the flow in orchestration.  </s>
<s> We may have to refer the VAT value as tax value...  </s>
<s> I think we need a concept of semantics to correspond these variables.  </s>

<s> Yoko You raise a good point.  </s>
<s> But it is a problem that can be solved by defining, in an abstract way: a condition, its semantic meaning and what to do when the condition is satisfied; and then binding the abstract definition to a specific instance.  </s>
<s> Here's a very simple use case.  </s>
<s> In this choreography a company that is generating an inovice needs to examine the country codes in the invoice and, depending on whether the countries are in the US or a country in Europe send the Invoice to a "US tax calculation service" or a "EU tax calculation service".  </s>
<s> Note that this is just an example of the principles of how to separate the abstract from the concrete would work rather than a definitive suggestion of what is requried.  </s>
<s> ABSTRACT DEFINITION The first step would be to define the condition, messsage and roles abstractly (the words between asterisks), for example ... If Condition is *USInvoice* then Send *Invoice* message from "Invoice generating role" to *US Tax Calculation Role* If Condition is *EUInvoice* then Send *Invoice* message from "Invoice generating role" to *EU Tax Calculation Role* Note, I am deliberatly not proposing a specific syntax.  </s>
<s> SEMANTIC DEFINITIONS As each of the items inside asterisks are abstract definitions they need to have a semantic definition associated with them, for example: 1.  </s>
<s> The semantic definition for a *USInvoice* could be "An Invoice where the services provided by and the normal place of business of the business that is generating the Invoice, and the normal place of business that is to pay the Invoice are both within the United States". 2. The semantic definition for an *Invoice* is "A document that requests payment by one business for services provided by another".  </s>
<s> 3. The semantic definition for a *US Tax Calculation Role* is "The role that provides a service to calculate the tax dues on US Invoices".  </s>
<s> I'm (slightly) laboring the point that abstract definitions are in English (or French, or ...) rather than any technical definition and that they must be clear and umambiguous.  </s>
<s> This is necessary so that the someone who has never seen the choreorgraphy definition before can take it and bind it to an instance with confidence.  </s>
<s> CHOREOGRAPHY BINDING The next step is to bind the semantic definitions to technology that implements them, for example: 1. *USInvoice* could be mapped to an xPath expression that returns whether or not an Invoice is a US Invoice 2. *US Tax Calculation Role* could be mapped to a specific service instance defined in WSDL somewhere that is to be called by the implementation.  </s>
<s> 3. *Invoice* could be mapped to a message structure, for example, a UBL Invoice with a specific namespace wrapped in DIME with optional attachments that is part of a WSDL Service definition.  </s>
<s> Now this particular choreography is perhaps a bit simple and could be implemented in a different way, but there are many choreographies that need to be standardized, especially for B2B, where this type of approach is really necessary, if there are to be a finite number of choreography definitions.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
