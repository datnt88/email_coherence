Jason Diamond recently commented[1]: An aside: I'm not on the WG but is it possible to subscribe to rdfcore without being able to post? 
I had no idea that you'd been discussing this issue to death on that list. 
The archives are public but it's just not as convenient for me as using my own mail client. 
I think that this demonstrates the need for keeping better communication with the Interest Group. 
For my part, I've been linking to the chat logs and minutes of our teleconferences on the IRC scratchpad[2]. 
However, I understand that only a small portion of the interest group reads the scratchpad consistently. 
Perhaps we should provide the contents of the scratchpad by email... Certainly, a big help would be to open up subscription on the list to the public. 
Ralph, Eric, is this possible? 
Currently the amount of traffic on this list is small enough that I think that most of the interested RDFIGers can handle the additional email load.

You're right to point out that this is something that needs more work. 
My co-chairing role w.r.t. 
RDF Core WG was motiviated in large part by the need to establishes lines of communication between the WG and folks on the RDF IG mailing lists (www-rdf-interest, www-rdf-logic, ...). 
While we are as yet far from perfect on this front, I hope RDF IG members will appreciate our decision to have the RDF Core WG operate in a publically visible "goldfish bowl". 
Unlike the previous phase of RDF work (RDF Model and Syntax; RDF Schema) the email archives, minutes, working documents and IRC discussions of RDF Core are public and archived in the Web. 
To this end I'd like to remind interested RDF IG members of the following resources: RDFCore Working Group home page RDF Core WG mail archives RDF Issues List RDF Comments mailing list (feedback channel for spec comments) 
The WG chairs and membership will do their (our) best to maintain the WG home page, issue list and related resources in such a fashion as to make it easy for non-WG members to keep track of the state of the WG's efforts. 
We have *not* at this stage decided to take the "goldfish bowl" policy to the extent of signing everyone with an interest up to our WG mailing list. 
In large part this is because that kind of fine-grained interaction with the wider community isn't the best use of everyone's time. 
The detailed 
discussions are there to be followed by HTTP (and, experimentally, RSS), and WG conclusions are to be visible via the WG home page, Issue List and (eventually) the RDF spec errata docs and new working documents. 
The WG is pretty new, and we'll be seeing how things shape up. 
I should also mention my goal (shared by a number of others here) of actually using some of this technology on WG process. 
For example, I have scraped some experimental RSS newsfeeds from the W3C mail archives: rdfcore: annotations: ...etc. 
Just edit the URI to name the list you're interested in. 
If we could that with our practice of using URIs to name RDF open issues, and the RDF Core WG's use of the mail archives as a repository for test cases, we have some nice ingredients for providing a richer-than-email 
overview of the discussions *across* the various mailing lists and websites. 
This seems to me a better way to proceed than to simply sign everyone up to every mailing list.

I do appreciate this effort, and I'm sure that others outside the Working Group also do so. 
Yet you make the archives of the list public, and perfectly readable through other tools such as an RSS scraper, etc. 
I merely ask why this information is not available over SMTP -- a more convenient system for many (myself included). 
I'm not asking for our discussions to be held in the wider community (as much as I may believe in that option). 
I'm simply wondering whether it would be acceptable to the chairs, and technically feasible to sign members of the public up to a read-only email list of the discussions. 
I'd even be willing to sponsor and manage the system myself, if need be. 
I agree, and would be happy to work with others to implement such a system. 
Still, it seems symptomatic of some at the W3C to allow the goals of the future interfere with getting something working in the present. 
Sure, it'll all be great and wonderful once we build the Semantic Web and our personal agents tell us everything we need to know and cut down on how much we need to read. 
But we're not there yet. 
Until then, I suggest we keep the lines of communication open to those who are interested, while continuing to explore systems that make things better.

I think that Aaron has a reasonable point here, which is not at all at odds with the stated modus operandi of this WG. 
The debate is, I think, symptomatic of the fact that those who routinely work with a permanent unmetered broadband Internet connection can forget that the Web is sometimes not as convenient as email for those of us who work without this luxury.
