<s> As a result of the discussions on the mailing list over the past week, the design team would like to make some changes in its proposal about MOVE and locks.  </s>
<s> We agree that we should not be specifying any different behavior for cross-server MOVEs than for MOVEs on the same server.  </s>
<s> So we plan to take out all normative language related to cross-server MOVEs.  </s>
<s> We do want to stand by our basic position that locks MOVE with a resource, since that is consistent with the underlying semantic model of bindings.  </s>
<s> A MOVE has no effect on the resource, but only involves creating a new binding between the final segment of the Destination URI in its collection and the resource, and removing the binding between the final segment of the Request-URI in its collection and the resource.  </s>
<s> The state of the resource itself -- including its lock state -- is unchanged.  </s>
<s> That leaves us with the following: For MOVE (assuming that the principal performing the MOVE owns all locks involved): 1.  </s>
<s> If there is a lock on the source resource that is rooted at the source resource (that is, the lock is not inherited from a parent collection), the lock moves with the resource to the destination.  </s>
<s> 2. If there is a lock on the destination resource that is rooted at the destination resource (that is, the lock is not inherited from a parent collection), its lock is gone after the MOVE.  </s>
<s> 3. If the source resource inherits a lock from a parent collection, and the resource is moved out of the tree affected by that lock, the lock no longer applies to the resource after the MOVE. 4. If the destination resource inherits a lock from a parent collection, the MOVEd resource inherits that lock after the MOVE. 5. If there is a lock on the source resource that is rooted at the source resource, and the destination resource inherits a lock from a parent collection, the MOVE fails due to a conflict between rules 1 and 4. 6.  </s>
<s> If a collection is MOVEd, and there are some locked resources in that collection, the locks on those resources move with the resources.  </s>
<s> For COPY: After the COPY, there will be no locks at the destination except what is inherited from above.  </s>

<s> This exact same question, regarding moves and locks, came up in the past and the group consensus was that we should not allow locks to MOVE with resources.  </s>
<s> To revoke this decision is to pull the rug out of implementers who took WebDAV in good faith.  </s>
<s> This is exactly the sort of behavior which makes some many companies wary of dealing with the IETF.  </s>
<s> The rules change too often.  </s>
<s> There is an alternative route which I believe meets everyone's needs.  </s>
<s> We define a new header, which can optionally be used with mandatory, that specifies that the move is only to succeed if the lock (if any) is moved with it.  </s>
<s> If the header is absent the server MUST NOT move the lock.  </s>
<s> The benefit of this system is that existing clients will continue to properly interoperate with both existing WebDAV servers and future WebDAV servers.  </s>
<s> In addition existing WebDAV servers will be able to properly interoperate with both existing WebDAV clients and future WebDAV clients.  </s>

<s> Why a new header?  </s>
<s> MOVE has a defined body.  </s>
<s> Add a new XML element in there.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> I suppose it's necessary to repeat this in every working group.  </s>
<s> The IETF rules for "Proposed Standard" are very clear and explicit.  </s>
<s> The rule hasn't changed.  </s>
<s> From RFC 2026: Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature specifications.  </s>
<s> It is desirable to implement them in order to gain experience and to validate, test, and clarify the specification.  </s>
<s> However, since the content of Proposed Standards may be changed if problems are found or better solutions are identified, deploying implementations of such standards into a disruption-sensitive environment is not recommended.  </s>
<s> Those who choose to implement and ship product based on Proposed Standard do so to gain the advantage of early market entry, against the risk that product changes might be necessary.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that changes from Proposed Standard should be made lightly or without good reason, but it is not "bad faith" to consider changes based on experience with the protocol.  </s>
<s> The ability to update protocols between Proposed and Draft Standard based on experience is a strength, not a weakness, of the IETF process.  </s>
<s> WebDAV is at an early stage of development and deployment, compared to what we will see in the future.  </s>
<s> Don't avoid doing the right thing just because some early implementors want to avoid shipping an update to their beta customers.  </s>
