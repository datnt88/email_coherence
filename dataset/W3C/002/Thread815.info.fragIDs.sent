<s> That's not a bug.  </s>
<s> In XHTML, *all* tags (element names) and attribute names have to be lowercase.  </s>
<s> See Judging from your snippet above, though, it doesn't appear as though you really want XHTML -- you have an attribute named "buttonType" which doesn't appear in any of the XHTML DTDs.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what you want is an HTML-ish type markup of your own, but expressed in XML syntax.  </s>
<s> In that case, I would use "output-xml", not "output-xhtml".  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Michael HTML is case-insensitive, XHTML is case-sensitive.  </s>
<s> Elements are defined in lowercase in the XHTML standard, so tidy correctly converts any HTML tags to lowercase if you request XHTML output.  </s>
