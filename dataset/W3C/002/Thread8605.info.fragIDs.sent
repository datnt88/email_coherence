<s> Hi all, My understanding was that transforms were required to include all parameters in elements, so mixed content of the Transform element is not required.  </s>
<s> It used to be required because we were just including whatever data was necessary (XSLT or an XPath expression), so I think the MIXED setting is legacy.  </s>
<s> However, I think the idea behind transforms is that they be extensible in the future.  </s>
<s> In the past, Ed pointed out that ANY means any element defined in the DTD.  </s>
<s> However, if you omit the Transform !ELEMENT declaration, I think you can put whatever you want inside it with a maximum of a warning from validating processors.  </s>
<s> I believe we could still include the !ATTLIST without trouble.  </s>

<s> I agree with element-only, because of the following: - Mixed allows in most cases much more than you actually want (mixed in XML can be controlled much less than in SGML) - Mixed is typically used for document text; transforms have clearly defined parameters (if not, something is wrong).  </s>
<s> - If there should be a case where using mixed for a transform is an alternative worth to consider, it's usually very easy to create a corresponding element-only model by adding one or a few more elements.  </s>
