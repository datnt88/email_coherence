<s> The expected semantics of MOVE is that I end up with the same stuff at some new location, and even a hope that appropriate references to the old stuff ends up pointing at the new stuff (i.e. that business about updating things between the COPY and the DELETE).  </s>
<s> The expected semantics of COPY is that I end up with a different object, so that I can modify one copy and have it not affect the other.  </s>
<s> Now let's look at what a MOVE on a reference should be.  </s>
<s> It's pretty clear that you just want to have a copy of the source reference created at the destination.  </s>
<s> If you look at how both hard-links and sym-links are implemented in file systems, this is exactly what happens.  </s>
<s> But now let's look at what a COPY on a reference should be.  </s>
<s> If you just make a copy of the reference, then any PUT to the source object will cause a modification visible in a GET to the destination object, and vica versa.  </s>
<s> This is the opposite behavior from what one would expect from a "copy", and seems to violate the whole point of differentiating a "MOVE" from a "COPY".  </s>
<s> One alternative is to revisit the definition of MOVE as a kind of COPY.  </s>
<s> Part of me says that is the right choice, since many (or even most) systems treat MOVE as a "rename", not as a copy followed by a delete, i.e. it is a change to the namespace, not  </s>
<s> to the object being moved.  </s>
<s> This means that the current definition will keep getting us into trouble (as I believe it will in the case of locking a collection), since it forces the server to treat a cheap operation (rename) as an expensive operation (a recursive create, followed by a recursive delete).  </s>
<s> It's like forcing every "mv" to be a "tar" followed by an "rm -r".  </s>
<s> On the other hand, for simple resources and simple collections, the current definition works reasonably well, so it would be worth trying hard to find an alternative that does not re-open the existing spec.  </s>
<s> One such alternative would be to say that the COPY automatically invoked by a MOVE is "no-passthrough" by default (i.e. like DELETE), while an explicit COPY is passed through references (i.e. like a GET or a PUT, whose behavior we want to affect).  </s>
<s> This does "override" the original spec, but only when applied to references, which is probably more acceptable, since references are after all being defined in the Adv.  </s>

<s> Thank you Geoff.  </s>
<s> I'm in the middle of a similar note but keep on getting distracted by work.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Yup. I agree.  </s>
<s> I tend to agree.  </s>
<s> I don't necessarily agree here.  </s>
<s> What I expect (or at least want) depends on what I'm doing at the time.  </s>
<s> I think I'd tend to expect the reference to be copied.  </s>
<s> I don't think my disagreement here really detracts from what you're saying though.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> We should look through the old discussions to see what reasons they had for this.  </s>
<s> (I started this in my unfinished note.) I recall one was MOVE between servers.  </s>
<s> That's not really a compelling argument for me and I believe that it was suggested at one point that if the move is between servers, then a COPY/DELETE would get done... otherwise, what you suggest.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm suggesting going through those discussions again to see what we can learn.  </s>
<s> I prefer the right solution over the expedient.  </s>
<s> We should not be encouraging the view that MOVE is a COPY/DELETE... except where necessary.  </s>
<s> Let's review old postings to see what situations we need to cover.  </s>
<s> Thanks again for bringing this up.  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> I hate to snip out all the sections where we agreed (:-), but for the sake of brevity, I'll just skip to the one section which raised a question: From: ccjason@us.ibm.com  </s>
<s> GMC The expected semantics of COPY is that I end up with a different GMC object, so that I can modify one copy and have it not affect the other.  </s>
<s> Yup.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> OK, I left in one "I agree", but I need this one for context (:-).  </s>
<s> GMC But now let's look at what a COPY on a reference should be.  </s>
<s> GMC If you just make a copy of the reference, then any PUT to tthe GMC source object will cause a modification visible in a GET to the GMC destination object, and vica versa.  </s>
<s> This is the opposite behavior GMC from what one would expect from a "copy", and seems to violate GMC the whole point of differentiating a "MOVE" from a "COPY".  </s>
<s> I don't necessarily agree here.  </s>
<s> What I expect (or at least want) depends on what I'm doing at the time.  </s>
<s> My turn to agree (:-).  </s>
<s> I think I'd tend to expect the reference to be copied.  </s>
<s> The problem with copying just the reference shows up especially vividly in a downlevel client (that doesn't even know about references).  </s>
<s> If I say "COPY", the key expectation that I can now modify the copy-target without affecting the copy-source is violated.  </s>
<s> The general rule I try to apply in these situations is:  </s>
<s> If there are two reasonable things to do, so you need an extra parameter (e.g. a header) do indicate which one you want, then have the default be the one that does what a downlevel client would expect, and have the presence of the header mean to "do the other thing".  </s>
<s> In the case of "COPY" applied to a reference, this would seem to say that the reasonable thing that the downlevel client would expect (i.e. a copy of the reftarget of the reference) should be the default, and the other reasonable thing (i.e. a copy of the reference itself) should be indicated by a header.  </s>
<s> The "no-pass-through" header immediately springs to mind.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> In many file systems, the implementation of move is different depending on the source and targets.  </s>
<s> Windows for example does something different if the move is within the same device or on a different device.  </s>
<s> UNIX is similar.  </s>
<s> So maybe we need to just state the semantics of MOVE in WebDAV and not tie it to a particular implementation, for example, the implementation implied by COPY followed by DELETE.  </s>
<s> Then the semantics can be expressed in a resource-dependent way if necessary including distinguishing references from concrete resources as necessary to produce meaningful results.  </s>
<s> Geoff (&amp; JimA)  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> Now to check the history of the decision to say MOVE == COPY+DELETE.... I've just done that.  </s>
<s> I've found nothing in the earlier discussions besides the mentioning of cross-server/device copy/move that might require COPY/DELETE approach.  </s>
<s> I think we've already dealt with that in this thread.  </s>
<s> In reading the spec, rather than just the mailing list, I see the WebDAV spec isn't that far off.  </s>
<s> It just needs to be clearer about intent.  </s>
<s> It's description COPY/DELETE isn't too bad depending on how you interpret it.  </s>
<s> We probably should leave a bit less for interpretation though.  </s>
<s> I think that's what JimA just suggested when he spoke of semantics vs. implementation.  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> The question of what does COPYing a link mean is an interesting one.  </s>
<s> It has been a while since I used UNIX, so I don't recall how copy behaves.  </s>
<s> However, on Windows, if you copy a link then you have copied the link.  </s>
<s> Saves to the link go to the original file.  </s>
<s> This seems really intuitive to me because the link has a glyphette that differentiates the link from the original.  </s>
<s> On the other side of the coin, it is not unreasonable to expect the "share and branch" semantics that VSS provides.  </s>
<s> That is, you copy and when you update you sever the link.  </s>
<s> I guess my initial feeling is that COPYing a link does just that and if we want to have a "copy on write" semantics, then we use a separate method or special form of COPY.  </s>
