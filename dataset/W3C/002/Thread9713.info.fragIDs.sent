<s> So, even if the "range" of xsi:type is a QName, that QName is expected to denote an XML Schema type.  </s>
<s> No?  </s>
<s> This is not my reading.  </s>
<s> The first sentence of the paragraph refers to a usual case when the type is determined by the type associated with the XML element in the schema (i.e., no xsi:type is used).  </s>
<s> However, when xsi:type is there, its value is a QName, nothing said about it referring to an XSD type definition or anything else.  </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong...  </s>
<s> I thought I did ;-) The text in question from the XML Schema spec is "The Simple Type Definition (?2.2.1.2) or Complex Type Definition (?2.2.1.3) used in ?validation? of an element is usually determined by reference to the appropriate schema components.  </s>
<s> An element information item in an instance may, however, explicitly assert its type using the attribute xsi:type.  </s>
<s> The value of this attribute is a ?QName?; see QName Interpretation (?3.15.3) for the means by which the ?QName? is associated with a type definition."  </s>
<s> I.e., the type is *usually* specified in the schema, but can be specified for each instance.  </s>
<s> This is exactly the same relation as what should exist in RDF for local versus global datatyping.  </s>
<s> I.e. one can assert a range for a property in a schema to specify the type of the value denoted by the literal, or one can assert the type locally for each instance of a literal.  </s>
<s> Thus, the following two are very similar: vs or WidgetX USPrice "10.05" .  </s>
<s> USPrice rdfs:range xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> vs WidgetX USPrice [ xsd:decimal "10.05" ] .  </s>
<s> In both cases, the element/property value denotes an actual datatype value, but the datatype which is paired with the lexical representation is either globally asserted by schema, or locally asserted with the instance.  </s>
<s> In other words, XML Schema employs *untidy* semantics for lexical representations!  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> It appears that community feedback is that that's exactly what we ought to be doing (for a small set of datatypes)  </s>
<s> I didn't see any substantial feedback suggesting this.  </s>
<s> A few outspoken respondents does not constitute an overwhelming concensus of community feedback.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the inquiry to the community had nothing to do with this, and the proposals reflected in that inquiry provide *full* support for all XML Schema datatypes.  </s>
<s> I think it's worth recapping how we got to the current point of debate.  </s>
<s> This is, of course, a personal interpretation and I'd be happy to be corrected by others.  </s>
<s> Following Brian's question to the wider community, it seemed clear that we were *not* going to get a clear answer to the point we were trying to resolve.  </s>
<s> To my view, and I think to that of others, there is no clear consensus concerning the tidy vs untidy question.  </s>
<s> Thus, we were in danger of creating a recommendation about a matter whose ramifications are not adequately understood.  </s>
<s> In such circumstances, it is better to be less ambitious -- better to leave something (clearly) unspecified than wrongly specified.  </s>
<s> Next, it seemed that there *is* consensus about the meaning of: :Jenny :age _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x type:integer "10" .  </s>
<s> i.e. the so-called "local idiom".  </s>
<s> It is the global idiom that is proving difficult to pin down.  </s>
<s> Maybe, we are chasing a chimera and shouldn't even try to realize that (global datatyping) form, however attractive its attributes may appear.  </s>
<s> Further, this "local idiom" doesn't require any change to the basic RDF model theory, (other than possibly to note the data type mapping is fixed separately from the rest of the interpretion).  </s>
<s> At the last teleconference, it was pointed out (and generally accepted) that to publish an RDF recommendation without a good account of how to deal with something as pervasive as numbers would be a grave disservice to the RDF community as a whole.  </s>
<s> This is roughly the point at which you have rejoined the debate, at a time when the choice between the triple-based local idiom, and extending the notion of literals to include well-defined denotations of numbers (and maybe other values) as well as strings, has not been finally nailed down.  </s>
<s> (But I think the group is leaning toward the notion of extended literals -- that's the essence of Sergey's proposal.)  </s>
<s> The WG has *agreed* that any deviations from the stake-in-the-ground proposal would be motivated by clear technical and practical considerations -- i.e. fatal flaws or errors in the proposal.  </s>
<s> This is a change of tack from what we were trying to do previously, and one which is motivated by a very strong technical and practical considerations: without cutting back the scope of the problem in this way, it is likely that this working group will never finish.  </s>
<s> More than anything now, we need to finish.  </s>
<s> Yes, there are details to iron out, but compared with what we were trying to do they are small details.  </s>
<s> If we get them wrong, the result will be some small inconvenience rather than possible severe damage to the whole RDF framework.  </s>
<s> And I think the "stake in the ground" still remains: I think nothing we're trying to do now is inconsistent with the stake-in-ground principles, but we are trying to do less so the full reach of that stake may not be needed.  </s>
<s> #g PS: looking back, I suspect Brian foresaw much of this back in Cannes, when he suggested concentrating on the "local idiom".  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Graham, I think it's an excellent summary, thanks!  </s>
<s> One correction: the new proposal should be attributed to Guha (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0199.html), not me.  </s>
<s> Sergey  </s>
