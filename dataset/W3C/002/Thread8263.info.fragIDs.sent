Hi, looking at http://www.webdav.org/wg/rfcdev/issues.htm 
, the discussion back in 2000 and the recent mailing list discussion http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003JulSep/0123.html , 
I'd like to propose: 1) Deprecate DAV:displayname: clearly, we don't have interoperability (some servers treat it as a dead property with or without a default upon resource creation, some servers treat is as live property based on the last path segment). 
Clients can not rely on the property being present (mod_dav, SAP) or being writable (IIS, Sharemation?, Slide?). 2) As the RFC2518-stated intent was to provide a *description* of the resource (which clearly isn't useful when it's always the same as the last path segment after un-escaping), I'd propose to add a *new* dead property to RFC2518bis called DAV:description which covers this. 
All existing servers that support dead property (thus all RFC2518-compliant servers) will automatically support this property, thus it can safely added to RFC2518bis. 
Regards, Julian 
I haven't heard any objection to this, and I think it's a good idea, so I'm going to add it to RFC2518bis as things stand.

Great. Wondering...: should we *require* this property to be writeable, or are there cases where it can be protected? 
I'd prefer to leave it simple, thus require it to be just a writeable property.

That's fine with me. 
And if we find in a few years that even this dav:description property isn't being used, we might want to consider removing the feature. 
The good thing is that we don't need to specify anything new. 
The only thing we do is to say that the property name DAV:description is reserved for the description of the resource, and that it must be authorable.
