Can someone remind me what we decided about whether literals were resources or not? 
Specifically, I'm trying to revise a sentence in the 
Primer that says: 
"All classes are implicitly subclasses of class rdfs:Resource (since the instances belonging to all classes are resources)" against which there is a question concerning rdfs:Literal.

Actually it kind of follows from the MT that simple literals must be resources, since 1. they denote themselves, and 2. anything that is denoted must be a resource. 
Typed literals are another kettle of fish, of course. 
There shouldnt be. 
Anything that can be in a class must be a resource.

This seems to me to mean that the following holds 
rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource . 
which I guess I'm OK with, given the current definition of literals (typed or otherwise). 
Perhaps that should be explicitly stated in the semantics doc?

Well, all such subClassOfs and rdf:type's which refer to rdfs:Resource are omitted, since they are all vacuous. 
Everything has type resource and (hence) every class is a subclass of resource.

Well, see my comments about the text in the Vocabulary doc about rdf:object. 
It seems to presume that rdfs:Literal and rdfs:Resource are disjunct. 
If they are not, then that text (and possibly other text) needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
Yes, this text has my mind reeling. 
My understanding of the reification vocabulary was that the rdf:subject and rdf:object of a reified triple were the things that the subject and object of the original triple denoted. 
In which case the rdf:object is always a literal VALUE rather than the literal itself, so yes, indeed, it can be said to be in rdfs:Resource. 
So the range is rdfs:Resource, and 
this should be altered.

The vocab doc needs work. 
It will get it. 
Stick to what we have decided and expect it to come into line.

Right. 
The point was simply to confirm that we all agree that rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource . 
and secondly, if that's the case, that perhaps the MT should say so explicitly. 
Patrick 
There is now a sentence about subsets of rdfs:Resource generally, in section 3.3: Since ICEXT(I(rdfs:Resource)) is the universe, everything has rdfs:Resource as an rdf:type value, and every class is a subclass of rdfs:Resource.Such assertions would be redundant, therefore. 
Similarly, some domain and range assertions are omitted from the above table; in those cases, the domain or range of the property may be taken to be rdfs:Resource, i.e. the universe; such range and domain assertions are essentially vacuous.

Sounds good to me.
