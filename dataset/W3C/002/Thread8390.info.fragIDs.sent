<s> What's the general behavior for changing etag and getlastmodified when a resource is simply renamed via a MOVE, or when it's moved to another directory?  </s>
<s> Do any clients benefit if the ETag is the same after a MOVE?  </s>
<s> Would the client get confused if the ETag is the same but the getlastmodified value is different after a MOVE?  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> It shouldn't.  </s>
<s> Also, the other combination can occur as well (ETag changes, but getlastmodified doesn't).  </s>
<s> This is because the ETag must be unique for all representations produced for a particular URL (+ variant-selecting headers), *not* the resource.  </s>
<s> Consider: /a/b with etag "1" /a/c with etag "1" MOVE /a/b - a/c The resulting ETag for "/a/c" MUST NOT be 1.  </s>
<s> If a server needs a way to robustly identify a resource indepedantly of the URL, it should use DAV:resource-id.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> Wouldn't the "getlastmodified" value change during this operation as well?  </s>
<s> I'm assuming that at the beginning /a/b and /a/c had different content, which is why the ETag had to changed when the MOVE caused the content /a/c to be overwritten with the content from /a/b.  </s>
<s> If that's the case then the result of a GET to /a/c is different after the move, so the 'getlastmodified' must also change.  </s>

<s> Most of the time yes, but not always: if /a/b and /a/c might have had the same DAV:getlastmodified property before the MOVE, in which case the date for /a/c may not change (one of the reasons why ETags are better than dates).  </s>
<s> Seems that the HTTP caching (lastmodified and etag) aren't very compatible with WebDAV namespace operations.  </s>
<s> The 'getlastmodified' property probably shouldn't be preserved across most MOVE operations.  </s>
<s> Recall that the meaning of 'getlastmodified' isn't defined as the time that a user last made changes to the content of a resource.  </s>
<s> Rather, it's the date at which the results of a GET request to that URL last changed.  </s>
<s> That's because it's tied to the Last-Modified header definition in HTTP.  </s>
<s> Consider the case where a MOVE operation overwrites an existing resource with different content.  </s>
<s> Clearly the HTTP Last-Modified header value must now be set to the timestamp of the MOVE operation, because this operation invalidates previously cached copies of the destination resource.  </s>
<s> Consider next the case where a MOVE operation creates a new resource with content from somewhere else.  </s>
<s> Even though that content wasn't new content, it is new at that URL.  </s>
<s> A client may get confused trying to synchronize a resource which didn't even exist before time T, yet its 'getlastmodified' or Last-Modified value is prior to time T. I think the safest thing to do in this case is again to update the value to the timestamp of the MOVE operation.  </s>
<s> If we want a property which instead tells us the last time a user made changes to the body of a file, we would have to define a new property which would happen to have the same value as 'getlastmodified' much of the time.  </s>
<s> But the new property would probably be client writable so that a synchronizing or backup client could tell the server when the file was last changed.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> I agree that a WebDAV client would prefer that the Last-Modified header (and the DAV:getlastmodified property) be based on the URL (and therefore change on every MOVE) rather than be based on the resource (and therefore not change on a MOVE), but 2616 explicitly states that a possible implementation of the Last-Modified value is the file system modification time.  </s>
<s> This is based on the pragmatic observation that it would be prohibitively expensive for a variety of WebDAV servers to modify (or supplement) the last-modification semantics of their underlying repository (which is resource based, not URL based).  </s>

<s> HTTP caching is very carefully defined.  </s>

<s> The Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.  </s>
<s> "  </s>
<s> If the variant was last changed through either a local file system move overwrite, or through a WebDAV MOVE operation that targetted the URL where that variant is accessed, then Last-Modified has changed according to the definition.  </s>
<s> HTTP doesn't say how it behaves in terms of MOVE because to HTTP, MOVE doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> But it does define things carefully enough so that you can deduce that a MOVE must change the Last-Modified value.  </s>
<s> The reason for this is because Last-Modified was designed for caching, not for display.  </s>
<s> If a MOVE request overwrites a resource with different content, caching agents need to know to update their cached copy.  </s>
<s> We've noticed that Apache doesn't change the Last-Modified date when a file is moved in the server's file system.  </s>
<s> It accepts the file system's say-so, even when the file has been overwritten during a local move.  </s>
<s> However Apache simply doesn't have the information that the file was changed so it can't -- in essence this is the "origin server believes" phrase of the spec.  </s>
<s> Thus, Apache can break caching.  </s>
<s> A client can ask for a file with a "Last-Modified-Since" value, and Apache may return a 412 Precondition Failed response even when the file has been changed due to a local file-system move.  </s>
<s> Clearly that's wrong.  </s>
<s> The design of HTTP caching isn't very compatible with how clients want to display the last time a user edited a file, and it isn't very compatible with how the Windows file system works.  </s>
<s> But HTTP caching wasn't designed to solve either of those problems.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> Lisa,  </s>
<s> you are right that WebDAV absolutely can't overrule what RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1) says about the Last-Modified header and caching.  </s>
<s> Thus 1) We probably should clarify the COPY/MOVE behaviour.  </s>
<s> Currently the draft says: "COPY/MOVE behaviour: This property value is dependent on the final state of the destination resource, not the value of the property on the source resource.  </s>
<s> It MUST NOT be set in PROPPATCH during a cross-server copy.  </s>
<s> " How is the previous DAV:getlastmodified date of the destination resource relevant?  </s>
<s> I think the only safe way to respect RFC2616 semantics is to require that after a COPY/MOVE, DAV:getlastmodified is set to the current date.  </s>
<s> 2) I also agree that this is likely to cause complaints from people who actually want a time stamp for *resource* modifications.  </s>
<s> A proper way to address this may be to define a new optional property (if we make it optional, we may be able to get it into RFC52518bis), for instance: Name: modificationdate  </s>
<s> Namespace: DAV: Purpose: Records the time and date the resource was modified.  </s>
<s> Value: date-time COPY/MOVE behaviour: This property value SHOULD be kept during a MOVE operation, but is re-initialized when a resource is created with a COPY.  </s>
<s> It should not be set in a remote COPY.  </s>
<s> Description: The creationdate property should be defined on all DAV compliant resources.  </s>
<s> If present, it contains a timestamp of the moment when the resource was last modified (i.e., the moment when content and/or propertoes last changed).  </s>
<s> This property is live and protected.  </s>
<s> The Internet date-time format is defined in [RFC3339], see the ABNF in section 5.6.  </s>

<s> So it sounds like getlastmodified becomes a 100% live property that really isn't a property of the resource, but instead is a property of the URL.  </s>
<s> It won't be setable and it's up to the server to maintain some sort of database to track if the mapping of any given URL has changed since some other point in time or if the resource itself has been modified.  </s>
<s> Is this doable?  </s>
<s> Would a server tend to do this recursively?  </s>
<s> ie, Every binding has an age and the URL can be no older than any of the bindings that are currently traversed to reach that URL?  </s>
<s> Or is there a better way to maintain the semantics that you propose we maintain?  </s>
<s> Do servers already do this sort of thing?  </s>
<s> If I mv a resource in to a directory served by Apache, does it use the date the file system lists, or something newer?  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> I agree with all of this.  </s>
<s> I have no problems putting an optional modificationdate in RFC2518bis if we can get agreement quickly because I think it could be implemented extremely quickly in several implementations.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> Since RFC2616 explicitly states that a server may use the file system last-modified dates for the value of the Last-Modified header, I suggest that we also add words to the effect that: "To deal correctly with servers that use the native repository last-modified times which are not updated by a MOVE, a conservative caching mechanism will store the results of the previous getlastmodified date, and only assume the cache is valid if the current getlastmodified date is equal to the stored getlastmodified date".  </s>
