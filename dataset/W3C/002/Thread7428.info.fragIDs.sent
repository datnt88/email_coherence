<s> 'namespace consistency requirement' is perhaps misnamed, it's a 'namespace hierarchy requirement'.  </s>
<s> The 'optional backpointers' discussion in advanced collections seems to have some interdependence with this issue; it might do well to handle old business before new.  </s>
<s> Is there room on the agenda to discuss the procedural issues around revising the document before Draft Standard?  </s>
<s> In particular, some of the issues that are 'too late' for Proposed Standard might be addressed as you go to Draft, especially as they are clarifications and fixes to address problems discovered while attempting to build interoperable implementations.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> Or perhaps there are two issues here.  </s>
<s> I'll put both names down on the final agenda, and see what discussion ensues.  </s>
<s> Noted -- I'd like to leave the ordering as-is for now, though, unless it becomes painfully obvious we can't make progress on backpointers without addressing namespace hierarchy/consistency.  </s>
<s> They seem to be somewhat separable, at least in my mind.  </s>
<s> I'll make some room.  </s>
<s> I'm certainly very interested in working to make sure that the Draft Standard revision clears up any known issues, especially problems encountered while implementing the standard.  </s>
