<s> Just thought I would report to everyone what I found today on Firewalls and Proxies.  </s>
<s> If anyone has any data in this area, please tell me... Web Folders. 1) Run with no proxies set at a non-SSL port.  </s>
<s> - Works fine 2) Run with a proxy server at a non-SSL port - FAILS 3) Run with no proxies set at a SSL port - Works fine 4) Run with a proxy server at a SSL port - Works fine It seems that the code line which does proxies without SSL is missing the Webdav code.  </s>
<s> IE or Office will simply send the GET and POST with the /_vti stuff.  </s>
<s> It never even tries to do an options.  </s>
<s> This all occurs when the Tools - Internet Options - Connections - LAN settings - Use a proxy server checkbox is clicked.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have a workaround for this without forcing the use of SSL?  </s>
<s> Is this consistent with what other people are finding?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kevin  </s>
<s> We found some (HTTP/1.0)  </s>
<s> proxies don't let through 'extension' methods like OPTIONS, let alone MKCOL, DELETE etc.  </s>
<s> Maybe IE is trying an OPTIONS and the proxy blocks it from getting to the server, so it falls back on GET/POST?  </s>

<s> This is a good point.  </s>
<s> I was working with Raptor v5 &amp; v6 for HTTP proxy services, a Squid?? (that one is a friend of mine) proxy, and the JavaWebserver Proxy.  </s>
<s> We were looking at the Logs of the Proxies as we went.  </s>
<s> When the checkbox for "use proxy" is set in IE, it simply never sends the OPTIONS request.... On that same note, if your client mistakenly sends an OPTIONS with a HTTP/1.0 Header, most Firewalls I looked at will block it.  </s>
<s> So be careful.  </s>
<s> (I noticed that the GET /_vti stuff still sends HTTP/1.0 headers.  </s>
<s> I thought this might be the problem, but by viewing the logs it was not) In viewing the Sharemation logs, there are some OPTIONS requests with the 1.0 Header.  </s>
<s> The following is out of the Raptor FAQ: 219 Can't parse URL: (OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0 ......  </s>
<s> The browser requested the use of the OPTIONS methods, but OPTIONS is not part of the HTTP/1.0 standard.  </s>
<s> It is part of HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> The browser may be allowed to ask for it, but it should specify HTTP/1.1 in the request header.  </s>
<s> The Raptor Firewall acts correctly in refusing to support it.  </s>
<s> Kevin  </s>
<s> 1. The Raptor text is nonsense.  </s>
<s> Anyone can send any method they damn well please over 1.0 or 1.1.  </s>
<s> Saying OPTIONS is not part of HTTP/1.0 is like saying you can't use any functions in C that aren't defined in K&amp;R.  </s>
<s> Now, their complaint about the use of "*" is more reasonable but since they apparently support the host header they really have nothing to complain about.  </s>
<s> They should just act dumb and blindly pass it on.  </s>
<s> 2. Any windows system running WebDAV must be using at least IE 5.0 and IE 5.0 defaults to HTTP/1.0 whenever it talks to a proxy.  </s>
<s> This behavior can be overridden if you can reach deep enough into tools - internet options - advanced - HTTP/1.1 settings.  </s>
<s> The reason for this behavior is that we found a number of 1.0 proxies which do not change the version number on requests/responses to 1.0.  </s>
<s> I send a 1.1 request to the proxy and get back a 1.1 response, so I figure I'm on a 1.1 clean connection, then things go bad because I'm not.  </s>
<s> Now the via header would be a real good tip off here but what happens if the first proxy really is 1.1 but the next one isn't?  </s>
<s> All these problems have work arounds but in practice nobody implemented them, so we decided to stay on the safe side.  </s>
<s> This shouldn't, however, have stopped Web Folders from working through a proxy.  </s>
<s> 3. I just connected to http://msdav.lyra.org/dav/ and any problem.  </s>
<s> The entire communication was over HTTP/1.0.  </s>
