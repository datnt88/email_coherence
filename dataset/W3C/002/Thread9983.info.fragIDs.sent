Hmm... I don't see any examples in the Adobe XMP section. 
It looks like an advertisement. 
Makes me kinda uncomfortable. 
Not terribly vendor-neutral.

Dan-- I agree. 
The XMP bit was added at the last minute and (if my memory is correct) is a slightly-reworded cut and paste from an Adobe blurb. 
If you think it's worth following up, an example would be easy, but: (a) it is (so far) an Adobe idea, so it's bound to be vendor-unneutral to a certain extent; (b) it does increase the length (but of a separate section, if we pursue Jeremy's idea.
