Hi! 
Is it possible to get tidy to ommit the "xmlns" attribute in the xhtml output? 
I want to post-process the output with a XSLT stylesheet, and well XSLT get's all confused just because of this xmlns namespace attribute. 
Greetings, Axel 
Not yet. 
You need to declare a prefix for the XHTML namespace and use it in XPaths, e.g. 
xsl:transform version = '1.0' xmlns:x = 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' 
Yes, but the ommit-output-prefix attribute does not seem to work with my xslt distro, so I get all useless output, with prefixes all overit.
