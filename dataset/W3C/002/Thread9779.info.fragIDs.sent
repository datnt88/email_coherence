<s> Actually, for the same reason, isn't this a "yes"?  </s>
<s> Because the non-dark statements are a strict subset of the antecedent?  </s>
<s> To be honest, I think examples like this are why we should have an explicit, not implicit name-based, darkening mechanism.  </s>
<s> At the F2F I was  </s>
<s> in favour of it, but the more I think about it the more it seems like a mistake to key this off property names.  </s>
<s> Some explicit syntax mechanism (either Patrick's, or an "rdf:asserted='True'" or such) seems much less error-prone... particularly if we can provide a little more sugar by having shorthand constructs (daml:collection) that normally produce some darkened triples do that "by default".  </s>

<s> However, closure rules for URL-prefix-based darkening would all have to be rewritten to not add triples if the predicate would cause darkening.  </s>

<s> You misunderstand; I'm not talking about an in-RDF (Guha's "same syntax") mechanism- I'm talking about explicitly flagging triples as dark using something like rather than implicitly by examining the property URI.  </s>

<s> For the most part it can probably be made "invisible" to users by, for instance, having the daml:colleciton spit out appropriately-darkened triples (ie, a little bit of sugar in the right place).  </s>

<s> Jan, same problem occurs with your proposal too.  </s>
<s> Let us suppose a file contains:  </s>
<s> Nothing is dark here.  </s>
<s> I then merge this with another file containing I have essentially retracted statements from the first file without touching it.  </s>
<s> Darkness specification has to be *in the language*, not in a particular file using the language.  </s>
<s> Jan  </s>
<s> I'm sorry; I was under the impression that the light and dark universes pretty much never collided (ie, that the result of that merge would be a graph* with one light triple, and one dark triple, the components of each being the same): that is, when drawing RDF, I'd need two different coloured pens.  </s>
<s> If a triple is _either_ light or dark, but not both, then sure, ok, I'll shut up.  </s>

<s> The point about a dark triple is that it does not have a corresponding assertion.  </s>
<s> i.e., does not appear the lbase translation of the graph and is transparent to satisfaction in the model theory.  </s>
<s> The reason for doing this is *to guarentee* that certain problematic assertions never really show up in the semantics, thereby ensuring that we avoid the Peter problem.  </s>
<s> So, any mechanism that relies on users remembering to darken the right triples or not make statements they really shouldn't have made is a non-starter.  </s>
<s> Similarly, a triple has to be light or dark *everywhere*, otherwise we land up in trouble again.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> I disagree: I say there are two instances of eg:blah in the merged graph -- one is dark, the other is not.  </s>
<s> The one that is not dark is not darkened by the one that is.  </s>
<s> I thought you had accepted (or acknowledged) this interpretation during thew F2F discussion.  </s>
<s> Yes, this presumes an extension to the graph syntax as currently defined.  </s>
<s> I agree with that bit.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Well, what I meant by _no_ was that if there is any way at all of asserting it, then someone somewhere is going to hack a way of not asserting it, and then someone else is going to find a way to add it, and then....  </s>
<s> I guess I have great respect for the creativity of users to find a way to break almost any spec that is breakable.  </s>
