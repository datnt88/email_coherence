<s> We need to resolve the question of whether this issue is in scope or not.  </s>
<s> Lets review the criteria for what is in and out of scope for the WG.  </s>
<s> The charter says: Implementor feedback concerning the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation points to the need for a number of fixes, clarifications and improvements to the specification of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax.  </s>
<s> The role of the RDF Core WG is to prepare the way for such work by stabilizing the core RDF specifications.  </s>
<s> The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax, nor to reformulate the RDF model.  </s>
<s> I presume that we are all still comfortable to be bound by the charter.  </s>
<s> Broadly, the charter says we are to fix, clarify and improve the SPECIFICATION of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax.  </s>
<s> We are specifically forbidden from reformulating the RDF model.  </s>
<s> What does m&amp;s say about the relationship between resources and literals.  </s>
<s> The problem we have is that m&amp;s is not as clear on some things as it could be - that's why the WG exists after all.  </s>
<s> Whilst its possible to come up with creative interpretations of the document, we should in principal not indulge ourselves like that.  </s>
<s> Where multiple interpretations are possible, the simplest and most obvious is to be preferred.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the issue in question here is whether the abstract model described in m&amp;s has a distinguished representation for Literals.  </s>
<s> I have phrased this question carefully.  </s>
<s> The question is not whether a literal is a resource, for to answer that we need to resolve a bunch of difficult issues around what resources are.  </s>
<s> The question is whether the abstract model described in m&amp;s treats literals specially.  </s>
<s> If it does, then so must we if we are to avoid 'reformulating' the model.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I am often wary of games in wording since they mostly seem aimed at making people admit things that they don't believe.  </s>
<s> So I ask you to kindly stop the wordplay and instead let's have a discussion on what we really mean.  </s>
<s> Still, even as message stands it does not make much sense:  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to interpret that, since my dictionary says: @prefix ed: http://www.w3.org/2000/08/eb58# .  </s>

<s> Perhaps you can shed light on this definition of "reformulate".  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it is unclear to me that we are strictly forbidden from doing so, it is simply not our charter (i.e. a specific goal/requirement).  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what that means.  </s>
<s> What is a "distinguished representation"?  </s>
<s> I think the question here is just what it would appear to be: Do literals (as defined by M&amp;S) have URIs?  </s>
<s> Based on what I know about URIs, I'm pretty sure the answer is yes.  </s>
<s> Let me be rather clear about my position in general: I think that an RDF statement is made up of three URIs.  </s>
<s> I don't see how this is relevant to the issue at hand.  </s>
<s> Yes, there is a set of things in M&amp;S called "Literals".  </s>
<s> Whether this is a side-effect of the XML syntax, or of the abstract syntax is not clear to me.  </s>
<s> Still, even if it was a special part of the abstract syntax, that does not prevent the set of Literals from having URIs.  </s>
<s> And if we do decide that they have URIs, that does not prevent us from maintaining this distinction or "special treatment".  </s>

<s> A basic principle for working in groups is "the right of the minority to be heard, and the right of the majority to decide".  </s>
<s> Can we have a straw poll on this issue Friday to see where the majority lies?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ron  </s>
<s> As I won't be there Friday... Much as I like the general idea of allowing literals to be resources, I am persuaded by Brian's argument that to do so at this time would be to stretch our charter.  </s>
<s> This may be a small stretch.  </s>
<s> But I think Brian is right to resist scope creep by identifying any issue that can reasonably be deferred to V2.  </s>

<s> Sorry about zoning in late on all of this - I've been busy and out of the office most of the week (thus, apologies but I'm not going to have finished my action points by the telecon).  </s>
<s> Anyway, Graham raised something which I'd like to underline:  </s>
<s> There seem to be two directions that the WG can go (or follow both).  </s>
<s> One, to produce fixes and clarifications ot the current spec (a primer document, something for the mathematicians, etc.?); secondly, to build RDF v2.  </s>
<s> Now, I can understand that the latter activity seems more appealing, but in order for the RDF community at large to take an RDF v2 seriously, I think we need to demonstrate the ability to accurately fix the current RDF in a timely fashion.  </s>
<s> Thus far, we seem to have been doing this reasonably well.  </s>
<s> There's no reason not to stop to discuss interesting issues on the way - nor to flag up things (as has been done once or twice) as "for consideration in V2" - (and even doing a lot of that consideration right now) but* when considering fixes/changes/whatever to the current spec, we need to consider if it's a necessary or flagrant violation of the POLA** from an RDF user's point of view.  </s>
<s> If necessary, we make it as sweet a pill as possible; if flagrant, chalk it up for V2. jan * this is my opinion only - I'm not a chair or anything important - just how I see the immediate and future tasks fo the WG. ** "Principle of least astonisment" - not an absolute method of formal proof, just (like Occam's razor) a guideline for good practice.  </s>
