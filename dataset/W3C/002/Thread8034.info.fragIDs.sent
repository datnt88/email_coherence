In a recent discussion, several people expressed dissatisfaction with 
rfc2518 section 23.4 which says that the Namespace URI and the local part 
are concatenated to determine the qualified tag name. 
I think someone even 
suggested that it was on the issues list and was going to be changed. 
As I 
look at the issues list, there is an item for it, but it doesn't look like 
it was resolved to take any action. 
What's the verdict on this issue? 
I would want us to remove any reference to concatentation, and to just say that a tag name is identified by the pair: 
Cheers, Geoff

Correction: namespace-URI, xml-local-node-name This is basically what the XML namespace rec says. 
I agree with Geoff. 
mod_dav certainly treats the namespace/name thing as a tuple, rather than a It seems that I recall one conversation that said that most clients and servers treated it that way.
