<s> Hi Patrick, I would suggest that perhaps uri@w3.org  </s>
<s> would be an even more appropriate forum for this debate?  </s>
<s> Whatever the case, I'll send this to www-talk, BCC'ing uri, and you can decide where to follow-up to.  </s>
<s> To define e.g. an 'http:' URL which is never intended to resolve to anything is IMO contrary to the defined semantics for such URLs and thus bad practice.  </s>
<s> No; you are implying that there is a default base of semantics for HTTP identifiers, that they are intended to resolve to a set of documents, or somesuch.  </s>
<s> HTTP makes no such assumption;  </s>
<s> If the http URI is defined by RFC 2616 (as indicated by section 2.1.1 of of the RFC seems pretty clear --- cut --- 3.2.2 http URL The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and semantics for http URLs.  </s>
<s> http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]] If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.  </s>
<s> The semantics are that the identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). --- cut --- I.e. there are some defined semantics that http URIs resolve to something located on a server?  </s>
<s> Is the RFC wrong, or am I mis-interpretting it?  </s>
<s> Having said that, I accept that current http URI usage goes well beyond this, i.e. people are assigning http URIs to all sort of things,  </s>
<s> This is my assertion.  </s>
<s> and that we've probably got past the stage where it is worth having the argument.  </s>
<s> Well, it'll take awhile to turn the boat around, but I think it's worth trying...  </s>
<s> A question... If I make an RDF statement about statement about a conceptual namespace, or about the RDFS resource that is at that URI?  </s>
<s> In either case, how do I make a statement about the other one?  </s>
<s> I'm about to submit a number of I-D's to the IETF for several URI schemes, including the following two, which address your question: Web Resource: = the web resource (if any ;-)  </s>
<s> URI Reification:  </s>
<s> uri:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#  </s>
<s> = the reified URI of the web resource  </s>
<s> e.g. in which case, Bob created the resource but the URI itself was minted by the DOI agency DOI's-R-Us Namespace Reification and Prefixation: xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with associated namespace prefix xmlns::http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with no namespace prefix I intend to proactively support the URI registration process, taking account of all comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc. with the goal of seeing the above URI schemes registered (along with some others ;-) These two URI schemes belong to the class of URIs called Uniform Resource Primitives (URP) as defined in section 1.1.2 of which is also being revised and expanded as an I-D.  </s>

<s> Good idea :-)  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I thought so ;-)  </s>
<s> Uhhmmm, and just how does that allow one to *make* statements *about* a URI?  </s>
<s> Can you give a quick example?  </s>
<s> And isn't the above just a bit redundant?  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Sure: you define another property which is the inverse (in the DAML sense) of the one above; say ":uriOf", such that:- "http://www.w3.org/" :uriOf http://www.w3.org/ .  </s>
<s> (actually, from a datatypes POV, that needs to be something different, but I shall defer discussions about that).  </s>
<s> Then you can say:- [ :uriOf http://www.w3.org/ ; :creator "W3C" ] .  </s>
<s> or whatever.  </s>
<s> Perhaps, but I was just showing you a different way to do it.  </s>
<s> I like your proposal, but it gets close to the datatypes discussion, and that's not something that I really want to drag onto these mailing lists :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
