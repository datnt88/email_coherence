Hi Patrick, I would suggest that perhaps uri@w3.org 
would be an even more appropriate forum for this debate? 
Whatever the case, I'll send this to www-talk, BCC'ing uri, and you can decide where to follow-up to. 
To define e.g. an 'http:' URL which is never intended to resolve to anything is IMO contrary to the defined semantics for such URLs and thus bad practice. 
No; you are implying that there is a default base of semantics for HTTP identifiers, that they are intended to resolve to a set of documents, or somesuch. 
HTTP makes no such assumption; 
If the http URI is defined by RFC 2616 (as indicated by section 2.1.1 of of the RFC seems pretty clear --- cut --- 3.2.2 http URL The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol. 
This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and semantics for http URLs. 
http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]] If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. 
The semantics are that the identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). --- cut --- I.e. there are some defined semantics that http URIs resolve to something located on a server? 
Is the RFC wrong, or am I mis-interpretting it? 
Having said that, I accept that current http URI usage goes well beyond this, i.e. people are assigning http URIs to all sort of things, 
This is my assertion. 
and that we've probably got past the stage where it is worth having the argument. 
Well, it'll take awhile to turn the boat around, but I think it's worth trying... 
A question... If I make an RDF statement about statement about a conceptual namespace, or about the RDFS resource that is at that URI? 
In either case, how do I make a statement about the other one? 
I'm about to submit a number of I-D's to the IETF for several URI schemes, including the following two, which address your question: Web Resource: = the web resource (if any ;-) 
URI Reification: 
uri:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# 
= the reified URI of the web resource 
e.g. in which case, Bob created the resource but the URI itself was minted by the DOI agency DOI's-R-Us Namespace Reification and Prefixation: xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with associated namespace prefix xmlns::http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with no namespace prefix I intend to proactively support the URI registration process, taking account of all comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc. with the goal of seeing the above URI schemes registered (along with some others ;-) These two URI schemes belong to the class of URIs called Uniform Resource Primitives (URP) as defined in section 1.1.2 of which is also being revised and expanded as an I-D.

Good idea :-) 
Thanks. 
I thought so ;-) 
Uhhmmm, and just how does that allow one to *make* statements *about* a URI? 
Can you give a quick example? 
And isn't the above just a bit redundant? 
Patrick 
Sure: you define another property which is the inverse (in the DAML sense) of the one above; say ":uriOf", such that:- "http://www.w3.org/" :uriOf http://www.w3.org/ . 
(actually, from a datatypes POV, that needs to be something different, but I shall defer discussions about that). 
Then you can say:- [ :uriOf http://www.w3.org/ ; :creator "W3C" ] . 
or whatever. 
Perhaps, but I was just showing you a different way to do it. 
I like your proposal, but it gets close to the datatypes discussion, and that's not something that I really want to drag onto these mailing lists :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .
