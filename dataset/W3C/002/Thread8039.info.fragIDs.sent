<s> Sorry for the cross-post -- I suppose this should be going to just the DASL list, but there seems to be more spam on that than actual traffic.  </s>
<s> It seems like not much work is happening on DASL.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any clients, for example, that use it.  </s>
<s> Is this a misimpression?  </s>
<s> Or is there just not enough interest in it?  </s>
<s> Or is it too hard to do?  </s>
<s> I'd like to be wrong about this, so please correct me if that's the case.  </s>

<s> Actually, I've been seeing a recent increase in interest for DASL -- there was a fairly substantial off-list thread last week.  </s>
<s> I've encouraged people to move discussion back on-list.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there is currently limited client support (anyone out there have a DASL client?).  </s>
<s> The Xythos Storage Server supports DASL on the server side.  </s>
<s> I think this is more an indication of the lack of server support, and this, in turn, is due to the immaturity of the specification.  </s>
<s> I think there is a lot of interest in DASL, since it dramatically increases the value of DAV properties.  </s>

<s> Hello, You're probably right about the clients; there are a few known servers that support all of DASL, but I don't know of any clients.  </s>
<s> (If there are any, please speak up.) I do know clients that support the DASL framework, but the search syntax is SQL rather than XML.  </s>
<s> Do you think there are any problems with the specification?  </s>
<s> Would you  </s>

<s> I've only briefly looked at the spec, will let you know once I take a closer look.  </s>
<s> We're definitely interested, but of course the lack of client support makes it somewhat academic right now.  </s>
<s> Hopefully that will change if/when the process starts moving forward.  </s>
