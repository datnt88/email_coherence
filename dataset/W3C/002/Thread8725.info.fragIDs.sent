<s> I've a few questions regarding the X509Data element.  </s>
<s> 1) Why impose the choice over X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI and X509SubjectName in the definition of X509Data?  </s>
<s> There are certainly situations where having X509IssuerSerial and X509SubjectName is desirable/necessary.  </s>
<s> Including both is still possible to do using the DTD/Schema as it currently exists but is not as concise as simply removing the choice.  </s>
<s> 2) There are some issues regarding the string representation of DNs as described in RFC2253.  </s>
<s> Minimally, it permits the usage of ' ' and ' ' in ways that won't work in XML.  </s>
<s> From XML spec: The ampersand character (&amp;) and the left angle bracket ( ) may appear in their literal form only when used as markup delimiters, or within a comment, a processing instruction, or a CDATA section.  </s>
<s> From RFC2253, amongst other references to ' ' and ' ': Implementations MUST allow a value to be surrounded by quote ('"'ASCII 34) characters, which are not part of the value.  </s>
<s> Inside the quoted value, the following characters can occur without any escaping: ",", "=", "+", " ", " ", "#" and ";"  </s>

<s> Carl,  </s>
<s> You have to use the escaping mechanism of XML here.  </s>
<s> Instead of the left angle bracket you  </s>
<s> can use the corresponding character entity "".  </s>
<s> If the parser parses your DN containing  </s>
<s> this entity string, it is replaced by the orginal left angle character again, e.g.  </s>
<s> your DN: "Jim  Jack" encoding of XML character data: "Jim  Jack" after parsing: "Jim  Jack"  </s>

<s> again, e.g.  </s>
<s> Exactly, but there should be some text to this effect in the spec.  </s>
<s> The text in 4.4 states that IssuerSerial contains an RFC2253 encoded DN.  </s>
<s> Since RFC2253 explicitly permits encoded DNs that are unacceptable for our purposes some mention should be made in the text, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Carl  </s>
<s> Carl, I don't think that this has to be mentioned in the draft since it is a kind of "normal" processing described in the XML 1.0 specification anyway.  </s>
