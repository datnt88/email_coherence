<s> Well, in the constant triage of life, the revised text is going to the group now.  </s>
<s> The IETF submission will have to wait until Fridaym or after the meeting.  </s>
<s> Feel free to critique again.  </s>
<s> It's not even proofed yet, so detection of howlers is great even if you agree w/ everything said within.  </s>

<s> I would like to see 'browser' changed to 'client' everywhere in the document.  </s>
<s> This is because 'versioning' is useful for authors who are interacting with remote repositories even if they're not using a 'browser'.  </s>
<s> I think also that most (if not all) of the instances of 'user agent' could also be 'client'.  </s>
<s> While all 'user agents' are clients, the converse is not true: some clients, and clients of version-enabled repositories in particular, might not be 'user agents' but other applications.  </s>
<s> There are places where you say 'versioning-aware', but I think that 'aware' is not strong enough.  </s>
<s> For interoperability to be useful, the participants need to actually support versioning, and not just be 'aware' of it.  </s>
<s> I think the word 'Style' in 'Style-free Versioning' is confusing; we're not talking about style sheets.  </s>
<s> And in some ways, it is impossible to be 'free' of style.  </s>
<s> Mainly what you want is 'Support for many different versioning paradigms'.  </s>
<s> It would be useful to elaborate more fully on what those different paradigms might be, or at least give references.  </s>
<s> In 'Legacy Resource Support', it is misleading to call 'non-versioning' servers 'legacy', since we might expect many future repositories to not support versioning.  </s>
<s> It's not 'legacy' in that you don't expect them to be obsolete.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you mean 'Interoperability with non-versioning systems' or some such.  </s>
<s> When you talk about 'named versions', it would be useful to explain that a version 'name' is often a number.  </s>
<s> What does 'Some versions of a resource are special.' mean?  </s>
<s> I would suggest _not_ prejudicing the design choice by avoiding capitalizing LOCK, UNLOCK, NOPS, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, etc. etc. which makes it seem like you want a new HTTP operation for each conceptual operation.  </s>
<s> Regards, Larry  </s>
<s> David, I'm not sure if this has been discussed on the group before as I only joined last week, but do you think we need to add an awareness capability to the protocol?  </s>
<s> Specifically, I'm thinking of adding something into section 4 along the lines of: 18.  </s>
<s> A way for a client to request identification of another client which has either requested exclusive access to a version of a resource (lock) or which has declared an intention to modify a resource (reserve).  </s>
<s> The idea is that in a colloborative environment one user would be able to see in some way who else was working on the same resource as him/herself.  </s>
<s> I also include the following spelling corrections as some of these won't be picked up by a spell checker:  </s>

<s> resource and determine: ul li a URL for the resource /li li a version identifier for the resource.  </s>
<s> /li /ul Note that this kind of facility supports only some comparison operations: It enables the determination that two version-containing URLs designate versions of the same resource.  </s>
<s> However, given the phenomenon of URL aliasing, it is insufficient to determine that they are EM not /EM versions of the same resource.  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I _meant_ to be consistent.  </s>
<s> Will global search to make sure I am.  </s>
<s> This seems correct to me.  </s>
<s> I thought that some level of support should be possible for completely dumb clients (at least).  </s>
<s> This might involve extra server work to perform automatic merges or some other workaround for client non-versioning.  </s>
<s> The term versioning style comes from a recent Hypertext paper.  </s>
<s> I will add references to a few of the significant methods, and call them "versioning policies."  </s>
<s> Interoperability with non-versioning systems it is.  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> I tried to use version identifier consistently not to imply either user-assigned strings, ro automatically-defined version numbers.  </s>
<s> I will change this to read "these versions of a resource are special" so that the reference to the preceding bulleted list is more clear.  </s>
<s> True, my predjudices are showing there.  </s>
<s> I will try quoting them and see if that's clear enough.  </s>

<s> I agree that this is critical, but would prefer to see it as a CM requirement (where it has already been floated by Yaron and Chris in slightly differing forms).  </s>
<s> This means we can get basic versioning standardized befopre we start arguing about locking policies  </s>
