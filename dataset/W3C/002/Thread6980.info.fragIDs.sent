Hello everyone, I wonder if someone can point me to a URI/URL validator? 
I've checked the W3C URI and Architecture site, but didn't find one. 
Is one (or more) available that you know of? 
Kind regards, Aaron Aaron E. Walsh http://www.mantiscorp.com/people/aew/

I don't know any. 
The problem is that the only thing that the URI spec says is that if it has a colon somewhere, then there can be only letters before the colon. 
All the other stuff is scheme- specific, with some commonalities with schemes. 
Regards, Martin. 
Thanks, Martin. 
In particular I was hoping to do some validation of URL+URN combos without having to bug the list, but maybe it's best to post those here as I did in the past. 
We're looking for full URI/URL compliance for our Web3D URL+URN combo identifiers, so I'll pass on those to this list in hopes of interoperability. 
Thanks again,

Aaron - Could you explain what an URL+URN combo is? 
I never heard about such a thing, although I have been following quite a bit of discussion in various lists. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hi Martin... 
No problem; I've been calling this the "URL+URN combo" informally for lack of imagination on my part: It's the combination of a URL and URN, which I'm now comfortable recommending to Web3D and MPEG based on feedback from you and Michael Mealling when I asked if this was legal per rfc2396. 
We needed a way to place URNs inside of URLs, which seems straightforward enough based on the document above.
