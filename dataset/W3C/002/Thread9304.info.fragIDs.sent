The area below is meant to be where we store the test cases / ntriples results but there are some problems. 
Firstly I cannot see that subdirectory in my Jigedit account but I'll get that dealt with myself. 
More importantly: The subdirectories there do not match the issue IDs in - I think they really should for coherency. 
There are duplicate names. 
There are mis-spellings. 
Some of the tests cannot be read - they give 403 error messages and this area should be totally Public (not Member). 
We really need some of these fixed 
Thanks Dave 
I actually have the same problem 
To get familiar with jigedit, we first created because we found in http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/ 
Issue rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr: Clarify the interpretation of an ID attribute in the 
propertyElt production within a Description element with a distributive referrant. 
but then we saw that is was linked from the Model and Syntax Issues as and thought that was the identifier, so we then created and we are not succeeding in removing directories 
agreed Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
I agree. 
I've asked Art to delete: rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr/ 
The other directories look to be correctly named. 
The tests in 
rdfms-empty-property-lements/ 
need to be made world readable 
should be renamed to error1.rdf. 
The nt files in 
need to be editted so that each statement is on a single line (my job) and also should be deleted. 
Does that cover it Dave. 
If so, Art, could find time to implement the changes.

I had the same problem; I think it's an artifact of CVS. 
I uploaded something into that subdirectory regardless* and it was a lot happier - I could browse it at that point.

On modesty: whoever said "it's hard being perfect" obviously wasn't me.

Can we get directories made for all the issues with test cases that have been provided already, so that when they are updated for the correct base URI and N-triples format, they have a place to live. 
This is one of the mis-spellings that should be deleted. 
The rdfms-empty-property-elements directory exists, with Jan's tests in it. 
I just tried to upload a test to one of the directories for my issue http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/ and get the usual access denied. 
Reminds me - I should probably ask that people use a .nt 
suffix for these files to distinguish from full n3. 
It might become important later to distinguish the two. 
Well either Art or the WG Team contact :-) Dave

I removed it. 
as well as this mis-spelled directory [all files are duplicated in the correctly spelled directory ...-elements/. 
This dir should be OK now.
