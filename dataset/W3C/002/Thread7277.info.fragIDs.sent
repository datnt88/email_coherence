<s> Of course, we are trying to address a whole bunch of issues which most file systems out there don't handle natively, such as versioning, management of metadata with arbitrary attributes, and what we seem to be calling "source retrieval" --- that is, retrieval of a base form (say, pseudo-HTML with server-side-include directives) from which the view of the resource presented to clients is derived.  </s>
