<s> S. 3.6 of Canonical XML is still confusing, in that the notation is not explained.  </s>

<s> Hi Rick, I considered this feedback, as shown in the latest c14n issues document, but came to the conclusion that I did not see anything confusing about "The content of the doc element is NOT the string #xC2#xA9 but rather the two octets whose hexadecimal values are C2 and A9, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the UCS codepoint for the copyright symbol (C)." which appears as the only note in the example.  </s>
<s> It seems impossible to miss.  </s>

<s> I missed it, twice!  </s>
<s> Or at least on two separate occassions I read the text, got identically confused and then later both times figured out what was going on (only to forget).  </s>
<s> In both cases, I think I assumed that there was a typo and the &amp; had been missed out from the things that looked like numeric character references.  </s>
<s> I think it is bad speccing to present something that looks like XML but isnt.  </s>
<s> Having the explantation after the event is not much help, because the confusion has already ocurred.  </s>

<s> In both cases, I think I assumed that there was a typo and the &amp; had been missed out from the things that looked like numeric character references.  </s>
<s> I agree the form better.  </s>
<s> The above is an example of what appears to be going on with this example.  </s>
<s> It should read 'I don't agree that the suggested form is better', but the above is how it goes if one doesn't read every second word.  </s>
<s> The point is that misunderstandings are bound to occur if one creates one's own interpretation of how to fix what are initially perceived to be errors.  </s>
<s> It is easy to imagine inserting the word 'is' at the second to last position, but it isn't what I meant.  </s>
<s> It is preferable to look at all the words in the sentence before assessing what I meant.  </s>
<s> I think it is bad speccing to present something that looks like XML but isnt.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, your suggested fix also looks like XML, and one still has to read the notes to decipher what is really meant.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's a bad specification because it requires the reader to read the whole example before trying to implement what the example suggests.  </s>
<s> To wit, if I were to change the contents of the canonical form box to the way you suggested, it is quite conceivable that we would receive letters saying 'I was confused because I thought the hex dump had to come after the doc end tag, and I didn't read the notes till later so I had to develop all of this hex dumping code that I don't really need.  </s>
<s> So, the spec should be changed to say that the canonical form is doc #xC2#xA9 /doc , and it should have a note explaining that the content between the doc tags are two bytes expressed in hexadecimal'.  </s>
<s> 8-) Having the explantation after the event is not much help, because the confusion has already ocurred.  </s>
<s> The explanation has to appear somewhere, and what you see in 3.6 is the standard format used in all of the examples.  </s>
<s> I hope you will consider my option.  </s>
<s> Cheers Rick Jelliffe I've done this because it has come up before.  </s>
<s> I chose the method you currently see because it is the method of denoting hex characters in the output that appears in examples in XML 1.0 second edition (and in the XML erratum from which the example is drawn).  </s>
<s> I agree that the example in c14n takes a slightly different form, but it was the closest I could find to having a standard way of expressing a hex character in an example.  </s>
<s> Moreover, it seems to me that none of the suggested changes for what the canonical form box should contain are better because one always has to read the notes to realize that what is shown is not the actual canonical form but rather a notation representative of the canonical form.  </s>
<s> This was the point of the (humorous) hypothetical feedback above.  </s>
<s> Another approach is to use a different background color from other examples, to show that it is not XML.  </s>
