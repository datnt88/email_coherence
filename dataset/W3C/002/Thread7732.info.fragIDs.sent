<s> Is there an existing way to set/remove properties based on the fact that certain conditions are met in WebDAV or DASL??  </s>
<s> I looked at the existing draft of DASL and it seems to be only query (SELECT), no INSERT or UPDATE.  </s>
<s> Any guidance would be appreciated.  </s>

<s> Not that I know of.  </s>
<s> You'll need two round trips (at least) for that.  </s>
<s> It really depends on how "atomic" you need to be.  </s>
<s> You can issue a SEARCH followed by a PROPPATCH.  </s>
<s> If you need a true atomic operation, then you can LOCK, SEARCH, (test), PROPPATCH, UNLOCK.  </s>
<s> There are also funny things you can do with the If: header, but I'm not really clear on how it can be used in situations like this.  </s>

<s> The If header doesn't let you express predicates involving property values, only etags and lock tokens.  </s>
