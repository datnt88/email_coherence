<s> Would that then imply that the entailment does not follow; i.e. that two resources with the same values for their subject, predicate and object properties may denote different statings.  </s>

<s> (eg. via a Note, via later work of this WG or another, whatever) could provide further properties that better describe the characteristics of an rdf:Statement.  </s>
<s> For example, DanC and I might define util:predicateURI, util:subjectURI, util:ObjectURI, each having rdfs:domain of rdf:Statement, to address the concerns aired in the use/mention/superman thread.  </s>
<s> By agreeing that rdf:Statement's members aren't individuated by p/s/o, we'd lay the groundwork for future improvements to reification.  </s>

<s> I'm not quite sure why you would turn it around that way.  </s>
<s> Why not just define a source property for the statement node?  </s>

<s> My take is that the subject would be your wife.  </s>
<s> The difference between the statement and the stating is the bNode of type rdf:Statement.  </s>
<s> Thus, because bNodes are not tidy, each may uniquely denote a different stating -- and all statings having the same S,P, and O are talking about the same statement, no matter where, when or by whom it may (or may not) be asserted.  </s>
<s> It is that bNode that denotes the stating, and which can take additional properties to describe the context/attributes of that stating, but all statings have a node intersection with any actual assertions of the referenced S, P, and O. A stating can exist by itself.  </s>
<s> An assertion triple can exist by itself.  </s>
<s> And if they exist together, they share nodes.  </s>
<s> That doesn't mean that any properties other than S, P, and O for a stating modify any other stating, nor that a stating entails the assertion.  </s>

<s> If none of the entailments holds, no special semantics is associated with rdf:subject et al vocabulary.  </s>
<s> In other words, using rdf:subject instead of ex:foo would not convey additional information (in P3P schema or anywhere else)...  </s>
<s> I'm subscribing under Frank's reply here.  </s>
<s> Sergey  </s>
<s> Strictly, in terms of the formal semantics, I think this is true.  </s>
<s> But because the formal semantics is mostly (deliberately) non-committal about interpretations of vocabulary, I think it is still possible for there to be some value here documenting some interpretation of the reification vocabulary that may reasonably be commonly held, even if it doesn't provide any specific entailments at this time.  </s>
<s> DanBri suggested an interesting position that additional properties could be associated with the reification quad rdf:Statement resource.  </s>
<s> I can imagine that the common reification vocabulary might be the "Rosetta Stone" for combining the results of various experiments that will probably be conducted in this area, as we try to find useful ways to reason about provenance, modalities and related ideas.  </s>

<s> We don't have to shoot it, exactly.  </s>
<s> We can treat it the same kind of way that Brian treated rdf:Alt.  </s>
<s> We can say that this vocabulary is *supposed to* mean that the subject is a particular triple in some RDF graph and this is the *intended use* of it.  </s>
<s> However, we can also say that since RDF itself provides no way to record the relationship between the subject of a reification 4-triple and the actual triple that it designates, there is no formal semantic constraint on any RDF interpretations from the use of this vocabulary and no special entailments (over and above the normal RDF entailments) associated with it.  </s>
<s> But that doesn't mean its *useless*, only that it doesn't have any extra meaning that RDF is officially able to 'detect' (in contrast, say, to datatype names).  </s>
<s> If y'all want to be ambitious, we could make it even more like  </s>
<s> datatypes in that we could invent an external 'reification scheme' defined by a mapping from some nodes to triples in graphs (triple-tokens), and treat reification in a way rather like datatyping, so that there are some semantic constraints attached to the reification vocabulary.  </s>
<s> All they would amount to is a requirement that the interpretation conforms to some 'invisible' reification scheme, which still wouldn't give us any new entailments, but it would nail down our intentions and be a hook to hang a more elaborate reification syntax onto.  </s>
<s> If there is any interest in this I could write a sketch of it up by NEXT Friday.  </s>
