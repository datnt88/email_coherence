<s> Action 2001-11-16#9 FrankM Clarify the architectural and other broader concerns with any datatyping scheme that must be considered.  </s>
<s> As usual, the action recorded in the minutes sounds much grander and well-thought-out than what I actually had in mind when I raised the issue (thanks to charitable interpretation by the scribe!) Anyway, what I was getting at was that, in the ongoing datatype discussion, what with all the discussion about the details of how the various proposals worked, what things in those proposals denoted, and so on, I was afraid we were losing track of what requirements we were trying to support.  </s>
<s> We need to be able to keep straight, in discussing the various approaches, whether we are (for example) disagreeing about the requirements, or  </s>
<s> disagreeing about how to support them (or both, or neither).  </s>
<s> This isn't  </s>
<s> to say there hasn't been discussion of requirements, and a number of the submissions have described individual requirements, or lists of them, but I'd like to see more discussion (perhaps in parallel with what's going on now) specifically targeting requirements, and determining what priority to give to them.  </s>
<s> Here's a list of the sorts of requirements I have in mind (in no particular order).  </s>
<s> Most, if not all, of them have been cited in earlier postings.  </s>
<s> In some cases, these requirements may overlap or are contradictory.  </s>
<s> I meant (and still do mean) to develop this theme further, but I thought I'd get this much out now.  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> Example requirements:  </s>
<s> 1. backward compatibility with existing RDF data and applications usage 2. works with XML Schema data types (or, at least, doesn't preclude  </s>
<s> using them) [In considering this requirement, consider both the case where we're processing RDF/XML containing uses of XML Schema data types, and the case where we're processing triples.  </s>
<s> Are there differences?]  </s>
<s> 3. compatibility (or at least non-interference) with the current DAML+OIL approach to datatypes  </s>
<s> 4. ability to use non-XML-Schema datatypes (custom or user-defined datatypes, or those from major components external to RDF, like SQL or UML datatypes) [The idea here is that I should be able to indicate that I'm using datatypes from a given datatype scheme by citing its URI, and handoff datatype-specific processing at appropriate points to a processor that is associated with that scheme.  </s>
<s> If XML Schema datatypes are handled in RDF without building them into RDFS processors (presumably by appropriately invoking an XML Schema processor), then it ought to be possible to generalize this architecture to allow other processors.]  </s>
<s> 5. ability to represent type information without an associated schema  </s>
<s> 6. ability to represent type information in an associate schema  </s>
<s> 7. ability for an RDF processor to handle typed literals without building the types in  </s>
<s> ***Others?****  </s>
<s> Architectural isues arise in, among other things, thinking about how and where various bits of processing involving data types are going to occur.  </s>
<s> For example, in Pat asks:  </s>
<s> (C4) are multiple type assignments allowed?  </s>
<s> (e.g. US dollar, decimal)  </s>
<s> Better, what happens when they occur?  </s>
<s> Eg suppose two sources/documents/whatever supply different such information; which part of the RDF machinery complains?  </s>
<s> (the lexical analyzer, the parser, an inference engine, or some other datatyping module?)  </s>
<s> So what machinery are we assuming, and how do we assume the various pieces handoff information to each other?  </s>

<s> Good plan.  </s>
<s> Here is my response to the datatyping goals you set out, in the form of my reflection and commentary on what I think you are suggesting.  </s>
<s> I've added one additional goal.  </s>
<s> 1. Backward compatibility: (a) with existing RDF data (b) with existing RDF code (c) with existing RDF-based specifications  </s>
<s> 2. Provides an account for using XML schema datatypes with RDF (this being  </s>
<s> a charter requirement).  </s>
<s> (a) where XML schema datatypes are used per XML schema specification with RDF/XML (b) to use XML-schema defined datatypes with the RDF abstract syntax ??? do we need to account for use of the full range of XML schema structured datatypes?  </s>
<s> 3. Consistency with anticipated DAML+OIL usage.  </s>
<s> 4. Also provide an account for the use of datatypes other than those from XML schema.  </s>
<s> These should be handled by the same constructs as XML schema datatypes.  </s>
<s> ???  </s>
<s> I don't think we should be getting into processing models here that describe who performs the processing, and how.  </s>
<s> I think that's an implementation issue.  </s>
<s> 5, 6.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to describe literal datatyping information with  </s>
<s> associated RDF schema statements (e.g. property ranges and domains), as  </s>
<s> well as directly applied rdf:type statements.  </s>
<s> (And possible other means?) ???  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what are the actual goals you are trying to capture here, particularly the "represent without schema".  </s>
<s> The above is the closest I can get.  </s>
<s> 7. Datatypes are not a built-in part of the RDF core, so different applications are free to use any appropriate datatypes wherever specified.  </s>
<s> XML schema datatypes are encouraged as the preferred option for W3C specifications, so a specific account is required for these.  </s>
<s> 8. Broad consistency with the specified model theory.  </s>
<s> Any proposal that cannot be explained using the current model theory must include the necessary model theory developments.  </s>

<s> Should we follow Pat's original mental dump format by trying to construct a matrix showing which proposals meet which requirements.  </s>
<s> That way, we can perhaps more easily compare the pros/cons of each proposal insofar as the requirements are concerned.  </s>
<s> We should specifically identify what this means.  </s>
<s> I.e. specific idioms, interpretations, etc.  </s>
<s> We need to clarify what "works with XML Schema data types" means.  </s>
<s> I.e. a) only simple data types b) simple and complex data types (though I don't see how the latter is really possible) c) only referencing data type URIs d) employing XML Schema mechanisms/vocabulary e) ...  </s>
<s> Should this be a sub-requirement/component of #1 above?  </s>
<s> This would likely suggest an interpretation of #2, such that, if we must support non-XML Schema data types (which I take as imperative) then this would seem to preclude an interpretation #2(d).  </s>
<s> I take this to mean "local typing".  </s>
<s> I.e. type is associated with the object node in the graph by some idiom (DAML/DC/U/...).  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>
<s> I take this to mean "global typing".  </s>
<s> I.e. the use of rdfs:range or similar mechanisms.  </s>
<s> And by "schema" you mean RDF schema not XML schema.  </s>
<s> This is likely related to #2 and #4 as to how generic "open" support for data typing schemes is provided.  </s>
<s> There should be a single conceptual model of data typing that is not tied to a specific idiom, and if multiple idioms are adopted then they should be defined as synonyms for this underlying model.  </s>
<s> We should not adopt multiple idioms which are based on different models, even if one can define the relations between the models and map between them.  </s>

<s> concerns with any datatyping scheme that must be considered.  </s>
<s> Yes, that would be a good presentation.  </s>
<s> But things we also need to be thinking about (and identifying) in connection with requirements (perhaps each of us individually first) are: a. whether there are necessarily conflicts among the requirements (i.e., whether satisfying one necessarily precludes satisfying another) b. the priorities we assign to satisfying the various requirements (which becomes important if there *are* conflicts).  </s>
<s> Yes (in fact, this is true for all the requirements; stated generally, they may mean multiple things, and we need to be specific).  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Both #1 and #2 (since the DAML+OIL mechanism specifically uses XML Schema types).  </s>
<s> I think it's particularly important to explicitly deal with DAML+OIL (and the ongoing WebONT work) because I think we need to take seriously the need for a coherent set of W3C specifications in this area, and address how they are supposed to work together.  </s>
<s> Depends on what #2(d) means in detail, but it certainly means that that "employing XML Schema mechanisms/vocabulary" can't mean doing that in such a way as to preclude using other datatype schemes.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I know what this means right now, but that doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> We should collect whatever requirements people think are appropriate, and then do the analysis as to whether the WG thinks they really are requirements, what priority they have vs. others, etc.  </s>

<s> (the lexical analyzer, the parser, an inference engine, or some other datatyping module?)  </s>
<s> Validation is one place where we need to have a clear picture of the machinery, but it seems to me there must be others as well.  </s>
<s> Any time I have to use the value of a property, I could (depending on how you assume processing is going to work) need to interpret a literal using its associated datatype machinery.  </s>
<s> Suppose, for example, that my runtime processing gets information from two separate collections of RDF (using different data typing schemes) on the Web, and needs to check two values for equality.  </s>
<s> This scenario may be considered beyond our specific scope (since you'd also presumably need to deal with vocabulary differences in the general case), but even if we don't need to have a "clear" picture of how this might work, I'd sure like to have at least a "vague" picture.  </s>
<s> We might decide that, as Pat suggests in his example, some inference engine is involved, but that decision, based as it would be on some general agreement on how processing would be done, would be very helpful guidance in understanding the issues, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Regards, Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
<s> A very good point.  </s>
<s> Obviously, comparison of values is as important as validation of values.  </s>
<s> I may be terribly naive and ignorant here, but it seems to me that this is really straightforward, taking the PDU view of pairings denoting the values.  </s>
<s> A given application that needs to compare any values must know about the data typing schemes being used, map the literal/type pairs to internal representations of their values, per the system/platform of the application, perform any necessary coercions, and make the comparison.  </s>
<s> The key to this is simply knowing what the values are, obviously, and communicating that identity to the application.  </s>
<s> RDF simply provides the pairings (defined via one or more idioms) and the application takes it from there.  </s>
<s> Or am I really missing something here?  </s>
<s> (I don't think I am, though)  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> Patrick, I don't think you're missing the point either... but there again, perhaps I am.  </s>
<s> I agree that Frank's summary covers the case.  </s>
<s> My (our) experience has been that the separation of the duties of the application from those of the parser (while clear pilosophically) present problems mainly in validation and tests for equality.  </s>
<s> Our solution is to restrict the equality question pragmatically to the domain of the application (by using specific handlers for various types).  </s>
<s> In reality, of course, the datatyping question comes down to the validation and equality mechanisms of the platform on which the application runs: you can't afford to care about what you can't recall - buts that's far too pragmatic!  </s>
<s> Validation comes down to a matter of product design.  </s>
<s> One wants to diagnose ambiguities and malformations by a consistent mechanism and present the user with a complete diagnosis.  </s>
<s> The division of RDF-syntactic validation from a more (shall we say) tolerant analysis by the application leads sometimes to potential conflict.  </s>
<s> At times, it seems we would want no validation at the RDF level above the basic well-=formed test and let the application take over all datatype conversion, mapping and interpretation but that leads inevitably to non-standard data and the horrible lock-in of data to application (which we are all trying to fight).  </s>
