<s> As mentioned in [1] and expected in [2] I'd like to move this document forward.  </s>
<s> If I request Proposed REC I might be able to make a case for advancement on the basis of [0], but the more documentation I have, the better.  </s>
<s> In particular I'd like to: 1. Fill in the row for the "#default" token and adequate performance for the empty cells.  </s>
<s> 2. Have a report that someone tested it (even informally) in some application context (e.g., SOAP) and it did what they needed it to do.  </s>
<s> 3. Have someone else try Gregor's examples.  </s>
<s> If you can contribute on any of these fronts, please do so -- if you can't immediately but hope to do so soon, feel free to email me off list.  </s>
<s> Also, if you know you have concerns or problems with exc-c14n, speak now or forever hold your peace!  </s>

<s> For example, [24]does your application scenario lead to any difficulties in which a subset (e.g., payload) require the use of an ancestor base that is not easily remedied by including xml:base in the apex of the subset?  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph, 1. #default is in the examples, so yes.  </s>
<s> Performance is marginally better than regular c14n, depending on the input.  </s>
<s> 2. We've used it informally in SOAP-based situtations and it solves lots of problems; particularly helps in the separation of some application layers.  </s>
<s> 3. I've tried Gregor's examples and, with one exception (example 4, regular c14n, GrandChild, xml:fool should not be there?),  </s>
<s> I think everything works.  </s>
<s> For other folks'  </s>
<s> convenience I attach a signature that represents these examples (hope you don't mind, Gregor), along with the raw c14n output.  </s>
<s> I know you want non-signature-based examples but, for the sake of this thread, it's a lot easier to run a signature verify than to check these by hand.  </s>

<s> Merlin,  </s>
<s> I guess that you mean example 1 since this is the only one bearing an xml:fool attribute.  </s>
<s> According to the second paragraph of [1], section 2.4 I think the appearance of xml:fool as attribute of element GrandChild is correct: The processing of an element node E MUST be modified slightly when an XPath node-set is given as input and the element's parent is omitted from the node-set.  </s>
<s> The method for processing the attribute axis of an element E in the node-set is enhanced.  </s>
<s> All element nodes along E's ancestor axis are examined for nearest occurrences of attributes in the xml namespace, such as xml:lang and xml:space (whether or not they are in the node-set).  </s>
<s> For "GrandChild", this results in the list - xml:foo (barbarossa) - xml:lang (ge) - xml:fool (barbar)  </s>
<s> - xml:space (default) From this list of attributes, remove any that are in E's attribute axis (whether or not they are in the node-set).  </s>
<s> After this step, the following list remains: - xml:foo (barbarossa) - xml:lang (ge) - xml:fool (barbar) Then, lexicographically merge this attribute list with the nodes of E's attribute axis that are in the node-set.  </s>
<s> This step results in  </s>
<s> - xml:foo (barbarossa) - xml:lang (ge) - xml:fool (barbar) - xml:space (preserve) The result of visiting the attribute axis is computed by processing the attribute nodes in this merged attribute list.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something here?  </s>

<s> Yesterday, I was able to confirm all of my examples with Gregor's except for normal c14n in example 1.  </s>
<s> Yes, this is the problem I had, and I think Gregor is (unfortunately grin/ ) right: However, I also discovered a bug from Gregor's example 1 [a].  </s>
<s> Presently, c14n.py does the following: 1. takes any xml_attrs (e.g., xml:lang) from previous recursions not rendered and adds them to local xml_attrs.  </s>
<s> 2. if the element we are processing is in the subset, it renders the accumulated xml_attrs as part of that element and and resets xml_attrs=[] 3. it recurses.  </s>
<s> This has the effect of rendering all XML attributes that are "in affect" since the last ancestor was rendered.  </s>
<s> Sounds sensible, but it's not correct according to the the spec [b].  </s>
<s> To fix this, I think we'd have to test whether the immediate parent was in the nodeset and keep a dictionary (instead of a list) of *all* ancestors' xml:foo attributes (not just since the nearest rendered one), with the *nearest* value.  </s>
<s> (Moving from a list to a dictionary is akin to what I did for the namespace bug.) This bug exists on in c14n, not exc-c14n.  </s>
<s> Hi Joseph,  </s>
<s> It is marginally faster depending on the size of the doc.  </s>
<s> Our code is still fresh and full of debugging code.  </s>
<s> Hopefully after code review and clean-up exc-c14n will be faster.  </s>
<s> I am finishing the conversion of our now deprecated SOAP-SEC handlers for Axis and HP-SOAP into new WS-security ones.  </s>
<s> Since WS-security 'strongly RECOMMENDS' the use of exc-c14n, I am using it to C9ze the SignedInfo of SOAP messages signatures.  </s>
<s> Yes, they seem to work.  </s>
<s> We have not try the signed version that Merlin  </s>
<s> has just sent but we will.  </s>
<s> I'll send you HP's entry for the interop matrix as soon as I have a better feel for the performances.  </s>

<s> in the test (see bellow).  </s>
<s> Also I have few comments to Gregor's examples Aleksey.  </s>

<s> I assume that there are no more characters after /Parent .  </s>
<s> 3) (Merlin's "signature" test") The Merlin's c14n-0.txt  </s>
<s> file is different from the  </s>

<s> From my point of view the last is correct: c14n-0.txt  </s>
<s> GrandChild xml:foo="barbarossa" xml:lang="ge" xml:space="preserve" /GrandChild iaikTests.example1.xml  </s>
<s> !-- Result C14N GrandChild xml:foo="barbarossa" xml:fool="barbar" xml:lang="ge" xml:space="preserve" /GrandChild --  </s>
<s> Gregor, you are absolutely right.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure the spec actually intended it, but it sure says it.  </s>
<s> So, I agree with all your samples and attached is a corresponding signature over them.  </s>
