<s> When I first visited W3C, I scrambled around, trying to find the published standard for JavaScript (which I later learned was called ECMAScript, from ECMA).  </s>
<s> Similarly, in investigating the SVG markup language, I found an obscure reference to "IDL" -- and no mention anywhere on the W3C site of just what IDL was, other than a name for the acronym: Interface Definition Language.  </s>
<s> It would be exceptionally nice of W3C to provide links on its mainpage to other standards bodies such as ECMA @ http://www.ecma.ch and OMG at http://www.omg.org , which hosts OMG IDL, a standard used in defining the SVG objects for the DOM, and especially to the documents used by W3C in reference.  </s>
<s> IDL was mentioned not once in the SVG References page, and has a broken link in the DOM2 References page.  </s>

<s> Hi Alex,  </s>
<s> I agree wholeheartedly that we should provide links to relevant information from relevant pages.  </s>
<s> So if the SVG and DOM specs rely on IDL, they should link to the IDL definition or some relevant resource.  </s>
<s> Same goes for ECMA script, if it is referenced from  </s>
<s> a spec.  </s>
<s> Activity home pages should also have links to related organizations (so, for example, you'll find a link to the WAP forum from the Mobile home page http://www.w3.org/Mobile/).  </s>
<s> However, I don't think the home page is the appropriate place for a bunch of links to non-W3C specs or even to related standards organizations (except, for example, in a news item).  </s>
<s> It would be useful to have a page dedicated to links to other standards bodies.  </s>
<s> The Process Document has some of this information already in an appendix [1], and one of my projects is to move this information out of the process document to the Web site.  </s>
<s> The question is: would people naturally go to that special page to find links, or would they prefer to find them in context (e.g., a link to the WAP forum from the Mobile home page)?  </s>
<s> Thanks for your support! - Ian [1]  </s>

<s> Basically, yes, we should link the IDL/ECMScript pages except that providing a link to the OMGIDL/Ecmascript is difficult.  </s>
<s> They keep changing their sites.  </s>
<s> I asked ECMA to maintain the old URIs but they don't really care.  </s>
<s> For example, this OMGIDL page is still "under construction": The latest version of the DOM spec contains the two following links: OMGIDL ECMAScript but I can't garantee that these links will still be available in one or two years.  </s>
