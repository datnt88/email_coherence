I've added the tests for this issue that have already been approved: [[7: charmod-literal issue closed]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0056.html and I added them in the new manifest format to Jan: please check if I got this right Dave 
Can I suggest an ammendment to the manifest: replace (globally - twice?) illegal Normal Form C literal with literal not in Normal Form C

Done. Jeremy: I forgot to ask. 
I slightly amended the comments in the tests to note the UTF-8 encoded octets. 
I hope that was OK. Dave
