<s> Folks, sorry for being so quiet recently.  </s>
<s> I was quite busy and now took some time to study the pile of material.  </s>
<s> I am still on the learning curve with regards to XML-Pointers or Canonicalizers (so sorry about any blunder i made), but I still want to push it off to you... Requirements: I would consider it an essential requirement for any canonicalizer to be absolutely loss-free.  </s>
<s> XML-C14n states in the introduction: "with potentially some information loss".  </s>
<s> This is absolutely unacceptable for digital signatures, and while many have expressed their reserved feelings towards canonicalization (especially being mandatory), this should be put into the requirements doc - and also later into the security requirements for canonicalizing resources.  </s>
<s> Ed Simon mentioned on the list a while a go:  </s>
<s> If the legal value of a signed XML document is dependent upon how it was presented through a stylesheet, that stylesheet MUST be signed too.  </s>
<s> but C14N removes such stylesheet information according to 5.3  </s>
<s> I would expect that in many applications, the validity and usefulness of a digital signature from a LEGAL perspective will require capturing not only the content of the XML source but also its presentation to the user  </s>
<s> European Guidelines talk about signature environments should present the user the information he is going to sign (what you see is what you sign).  </s>
<s> Now considering the potential implications of pulling in external references (section 4 of c14n) ...... is it likely that an application might do that when displaying some XML?  </s>
<s> Maybe, I have no idea, but it makes me nervous in case it shouldn't and the signature module than pulls in (lots of) documents by indirection - I assume that in case e1.xml in c14n/section 4 could again contain entity references?  </s>
<s> I must admit that canonicalizers makes me very nervous generally ..... except the NULL-variant :-)  </s>
<s> I thought I had understood, but the more I think about it the less I do: what do we need that for in the first place?  </s>
<s> To save some space for some apps that tend to manipulate and store these things in different forms (DOM) only?  </s>
<s> Couldn't they simply save the original data somewhere?  </s>

<s> Just to add: I do NOT have a problem understanding canonicalization required  </s>
<s> by different character-sets, different line-breaks, and things like that.  </s>
<s> Obviously necessary as we are talking about text-based documents.  </s>
<s> I was just  </s>
<s> wondering if anything beyond that was really an requirement (like pulling in  </s>
<s> external stuff).  </s>
<s> Looking at DOMHASH, this doesn't adress any of these basic canonicalization issues (just mentioning it).  </s>
<s> Am I missing something here?  </s>

<s> in  </s>
<s> My pragmatic opinion on this (aside from all the interesting discussion): If we have any mandatory to implement c14n at this stage, I don't think it should do anything beyond character composition/encoding/CR-LF processing.  </s>
<s> Additionally, we should specify (or adopt) it ASAP and ensure its been widely implemented/tested/used before normatively referencing/including it.  </s>
<s> Syntax c14n, DOM-HASH, or whatever can evolve and be standardized as appropriate by another WG, or by this one once we've completed the core signature by December.  </s>
