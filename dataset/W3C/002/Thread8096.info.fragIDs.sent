<s> You managed to completely puzzle me.  </s>
<s> I thought that was exactly the point of this kind of request.  </s>
<s> Can you please explain again what the issue to be solved is, or point me to  </s>
<s> "the" mailing list message (in the archive) that explains it?  </s>
<s> Lisa, the use case which started the whole thread is "the client wants the  </s>
<s> request to succeed irregardless of wether the lock is still there or not".  </s>
<s> The addition of "*" to the If header does not help to solve this case.  </s>
<s> The introduction of "*" addresses the problem where the client is not sure for exactly which URIs it must provide lock-tokens in the IF header.  </s>
<s> That is also a problem worth addressing.  </s>
<s> Jason mentioned some weeks ago that 2518 does not clearly define when a lock-token is "submitted" and how the methods should check for submitted tokens.  </s>
<s> As I see it, the IF header is used for two purposes: P1) resource state checking P2) submitting "known" lock tokens P1 is, IMHO, pretty good defined.  </s>
<s> A client puts the URI of the resource to check in the IF header.  </s>
<s> If the URI is omitted, the request URI is silently substituted.  </s>
<s> All mentioned resource states are then verified by the server.  </s>
<s> Should  </s>
<s> a state not match (e.g. a lock token no longer there), the server will  </s>
<s> fail the request immediatly.  </s>
<s> For P2 we should define that server implementations should regard all lock-tokens supplied in the IF header as "submitted tokens".  </s>
<s> When verifying locks on resources affected by methods (such as COPY or MOVE), servers should for locked resources look into the set of "submitted tokens".  </s>
<s> If the lock is there, the request can proceed.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it will fail with a 423.  </s>
<s> Defining this behaviour will increase interoperability and ease life for clients.  </s>
<s> Clients just memorize the lock token together with the URI the lock was created on.  </s>
<s> They can then simply place those tuples in the IF headers of requests and everything should work fine.  </s>
<s> More optimizing clients might more carefully chose the locks to submit, but that is left up to their implementation.  </s>

<s> Yes. That's the point of locking.  </s>
<s> If it expired before it should, the server may be broken.  </s>
<s> Fix it.  </s>

<s> From: Lisa Dusseault [mailto:lisa@xythos.com]  </s>
<s> Weird, eh?  </s>
<s> By using the If-Not-If hack, the client asks the request to succeed if the locktoken is invalid, or the locktoken is valid.  </s>
<s> So the client never finds out if the locktoken is invalid, because the if-not-if combination never fails.  </s>
<s> And if the client uses the proposed new header, the exact same thing occurs, i.e. the client never finds out if the locktoken is invalid, because the new header never fails.  </s>
<s> What puzzled Julian was not the semantics that you were describing, but rather the fact that you dislike the semantics when it is marshalled in an If header, but like it when it is marshalled in the new header.  </s>
<s> The issue to be solved is that all the client developers who have spoken up about the if header say that it's too hard to make interoperable.  </s>
<s> And we have two proposals for how to fix this.  </s>
<s> We are now debating the relative merits of those two proposals.  </s>
<s> Every time the client is tested against a new server, some operations on locked resources fail.  </s>
<s> Usually they fail because 1. the server expects to see a lock token that the client hasn't provided, 2. the server expects a lock token to apply to a specific URL and the client didn't use the correct URL, 3. the client provides a locktoken for a URL that isn't even affected in the request, and that lock token or URL is incorrect, or 4. the lock expired.  </s>
<s> The reason why I suggested the approach of defining '*' as a wildcard for the IF header is because - it removes the need to figure out which URL to put the locktoken on (fixing #2) Since the only safe way (i.e. that prevents lost updates) to avoid checking the validity of the lock token is to also specify an If header with an etag for the resource, the client must specify the appropriate URL for the etag.  </s>
<s> And if it can remember what etag goes with a URL, it can remember what lock token goes with a URL.  </s>
<s> This is one of my objections to this separate header.  </s>
<s> It makes it too easy for a client writer who finds the If header "too complicated" to just use this new header, omit to specify an If header with appropriate etags, and then overwrite changes made by other clients to resources whose locks have expired.  </s>
<s> Conversely, a client that can properly keep track of an etag (which requires keeping track of what URL it goes with), can use the same data structures to keep track of what lock token goes with that URL (and therefore #2 would not be an issue).  </s>
<s> - when multiple resources are under the same lock, and when the lock token appears with '*', it's clear that it applies to any resource locked with that token (fixing #2 even more); As above, * doesn't work with etags (which must be used if locks are not going to be checked), and if a client is going to accurately track the etag for a URL, it can use the same data structure to accurately track the lock token for a URL. - it makes it easier to include lock tokens that aren't actually required (fixing #3 and making #1 less likely) A debate of which method is "easier" is unlikely to be productive.  </s>
<s> Those of us that prefer the If/Not method believe it is "easier" because it is more regular and more accurately reflects the semantics being used.  </s>
<s> - It's shorter than putting the full URL (although we may still need comma support) (making #1 easier to achieve by including more lock tokens before running up against length limitations) We have agreed that the "new header" method has 25% fewer non-constant strings per locked resource (3 instead of 4).  </s>
<s> But several of us feel that the 25% savings in header length for this use case does not merit the introduction of a new header.  </s>
