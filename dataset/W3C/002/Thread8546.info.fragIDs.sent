<s> If this is the case, the enveloping-signature algorithm seems worthless... --Kevin  </s>
<s> That's because the content model of the DTD is rather limited in that anything should be able to go in an Object, and we have to specify the few things from our own set, and hope #PCDATA means external data (which it doesn't, that's why we are using Schema).  </s>
