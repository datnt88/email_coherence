See: Note - I have not yet agreed the following change with Graham. 
new section 3.7, old section 2.5 3.7 RDF Core URI Vocabulary and Namespaces (Normative) 
(In the agreed change it was unclear where it went). 
Note2 - indentation in ToC is incorrect. 
Note3 - more work to do before ready for review. 
Jeremy 
I hereby agree this change. 
I the revised structure, I think it's an improvement.

[ I note TOC 4 has a 2.4.2 under it ] So in summary the renumbering was 1.2 deleted 2.3 = 3 2.3.5 deleted, 2.3.6= 
3.5, 2.3.7= 
3.6 2.4 = 4 [reordered subsections] 2.5 now 3.7 3 onwards = 5 onwards can you confirm, check this; maybe add in a changes note/email. 
So all the structuring and renumbering is done now? 
Can I update my references now? 
Dave 
This looks correct to me.
