<s> Issue  </s>
<s> requests a standard way to represent boolean valued properties and suggests the definition of rdf:is and rdf:isNot properties to meet this need.  </s>
<s> Propose that as schema data types define a boolean data value, this issue be merged with: Brian  </s>
<s> another way to look at boolean-valued properties is ala one-place-predicates.  </s>
<s> I recommend representing HappyPerson(Fred) as ex:Fred rdf:type ex:HappyPerson.  </s>
<s> i.e. for rdf:is, we have rdf:type for rdf:isNot, we sort-of/will have rdf:type along with ont:complementOf so... ex:Bob rdf:type [ ont:complementOf ex:HappyPerson].  </s>
<s> DebM in the WebOnt WG is maintaing a tips/tricks document; perhaps this idiom could go there, if not in our primer.  </s>

<s> Neat. And closer to Aaron's original request.  </s>
<s> And is not tied up with datatypes issue.  </s>
<s> Aaron, would you be happy with that?  </s>

<s> I don't oppose the proposal, but I'd like to note that there's an alternative approach, also not requiring any new vocabulary.  </s>
<s> A Boolean valued property could be regarded as equivalent to a monadic predicate; e.g. (IsLikeThis(SomeResource) == TRUE) = IsLikeThis(SomeResource) Treatments of typed logic that I have read (notably Sowa's book Knowledge Representation) suggest that a type is just a shorthand for a value that satisfies a monadic predicate: (FORALL (x:integer) (EXISTS (y:integer) y  x)) is equivalent to: (FORALL (x) integer(x) = (EXISTS (y) integer(y) AND y x)) Which leads to the idea that Boolean valued properties are simply monadic predicates which can be represented as types: X rdf:type integer .  </s>

<s> Hmm, not sure I agree.  </s>
<s> That is one way to do it, but another would be to say that a boolean-valued property should be identified with a class; the property is true of aaa iff aaa is in the class.  </s>
<s> The example of ChocolateLover certainly suggests this to me.  </s>
<s> Then rdf:is would be rdf:type.  </s>

<s> The question is, what significance do we attach to identifying something as a "type"?  </s>
