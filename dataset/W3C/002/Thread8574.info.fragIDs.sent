<s> Just as a person or automatable mechanism should only sign what it "sees," persons and automated mechanisms that trust the validity of a transformed  </s>

<s> was transformed (including canonicalization) and signed, not the original pre-transformed data.  </s>
<s> /+This recommendation applies to transforms specified  </s>

<s> For instance, if an XML document includes an embedded stylesheet [XSLT] it is the transformed document that that SHOULD be represented to the  </s>

<s> To meet this recommendation where a document references an external style sheet, the content of that external resource SHOULD also be signed via a signature Reference -- otherwise the content of that external content might change which alters the resulting document without invalidating the signature.+/  </s>
<s> I believe the reason these started out as SHOULDs is because we want to be permissive to applications and we can't enforce/check some of these recommendations.  </s>
<s> However, I'd feel more comfortable if some of them where a MUST.  </s>
<s> Does the WG think we are communicating the hazards involved in this domain of transforms well?  </s>
<s> Will implementors know to lock this stuff down and or even prohibit it if they don't do a really really good job?  </s>

<s> I agree with Donald.  </s>
<s> With regard to section 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, while it may be reasonable to briefly point out ways that inexperienced implementors could create ineffective XML Signatures, there are applications where the use of significantly altering transforms is useful and we don't want to stop those who know what they are doing from doing it.  </s>
<s> When discussing XSLT, it is important to remember there are two semantically different reasons for using it: 1.  </s>
<s> To define how an XML document should appear to a viewer.  </s>
<s> 2. To transform an XML document into the data to be signed (eg.  </s>
<s> as an alternative to XPath where XPath is insufficient).  </s>
<s> For some apps, the same XSLT transformations may accomplish both cases 1 and 2. For others, different transformations may be needed for each case.  </s>
<s> And for other apps, only one of case 1 or 2 may be relevant.  </s>
<s> I have no doubt that experience with real-world XML Signatures will help us understand what constitutes best practice.  </s>
<s> While we can list some basic "watch it"s in the spec, we MUST NOT be too restrictive ;-}.  </s>
<s> I would even go as far as taking out all the RFC2119 key words in section 8.1.3.  </s>
