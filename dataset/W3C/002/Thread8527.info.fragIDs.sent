I was trying to represent the present spec [1] as clearly as possible in terms of modelling [2] what we area trying to specify and hit a question based on the following: (SignedInfo) (SignatureValue) (KeyInfo)? 
(Object)* Given you can only have one SignatureValue in a Signature, than all elements within KeyInfo (perhaps a KeyName and a KeyValue) are related by identity, or they are all supposed to be about the same key basically. 
If you want more than one signature (I and Don signed it), you have to construct a whole new signature block, right? 
Or is it possible to hang more than one (KeyInfo, SigValue) pair off the same SignedInfo via a reference to it?

A question ... What would be the best way to handle the situation where someone wanted to sign **exactly the same** data, but using different certificates and/or signature algorithms? 
It seems to me that the "Objects" and the "ObjectReferences" would be identical and in the current specification would have to be duplicated. 
Thoughts David Burdett You are precisely correct -- the second person must duplicate the signedinfo block and create their own signature. 
If the second person wanted to also sign in the first signature (a very common case) they would add a new ObjectReference to their own signature block.

You have to duplicate the Signature element but you can make it smaller by having only one ObjectReference in SignedInfo and having it point to an Object with a Manifest in that which in turn points to all the things you actually want to secure. 
This Object would not be duplicated. 
It would probably be outside all the Signature s although I guess it could be inside one of them if you wanted.
