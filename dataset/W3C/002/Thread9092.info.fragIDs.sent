<s> However, one qualification on the XML Schema point.  </s>
<s> While we started out using a DTD, we did migrate to using schema's (because of these and related problems with DTDs) and, as the REC says, the schema is normative, not the DTD.  </s>
<s> We wanted to clearly place these element types in a namespace, but we didn't want to dicate exactly *where* those declarations have to appear.  </s>
<s> (For example, to accomodate your example in which the declaration appears in a ancestor).  </s>
<s> The best way we could represent this in the DTD was to use #FIXED.  </s>
<s> So the intent is to explicitly have the namespace explicitly somewhere in the hierarchy.  </s>

<s> Christian: Excellent point.  </s>
<s> As you point out, the presence of the xmlns attribute in the Signature element in the Information Set vs the serialized version means different things.  </s>
<s> If it happens to be ommited in the serialized (marshalled) XML, that does NOT exlude it from the Information Set.  </s>
<s> Although I agree the ommission would be considered a poor practice.  </s>
<s> Regardless, the presence or absence in the serialization is irrelevant in the context of the actual signature since the Signature element is not actually hashed, only the canonical version of the SignedInfo is subject to the crypto.  </s>
