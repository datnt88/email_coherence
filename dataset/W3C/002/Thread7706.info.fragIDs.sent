FYI, I'm leaving Netscape; as of the 18th (or earlier), my email address will be francis@appoint.net. 
My new employers have agreed to let me remain active in the DAV WG, but I will not have time for the versioning design team. 
I do not think Netscape will be sending anybody to replace me in the working group--at least, I haven't heard anything so far.

does this signal a trend from Netscape: it will be not so active in the 
exploration/development of the W3C projects?

I have no idea. 
Anyway, I do not speak for Netscape.
