<s> Peoples, I have been doing some stuff on using the Apache DOM parser and XSLT engine (C versions) to build an implementation of the XML Signature standard.  </s>
<s> One thing of interest has just come up around XPath and the here() function.  </s>
<s> In particular the XPath implementation is used as a basis for XSLT and only allows External functions (such as here()) to be installed if they are namespace qualified.  </s>
<s> Which means that it won't process the here() function when it is presented as an NCName.  </s>
<s> Given their are at least two definitions of here() (Signature and XPointer - both currently with the same semantics) should XML Signature define the here function as part of the DSIG namespace?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Berin  </s>

<s> Hi Berin, I haven't encountered this issue before.  </s>
<s> You are right that the function is a QName: [35] FunctionName ::= QName - NodeType [6] QName ::= (Prefix ':')?  </s>
<s> LocalPart  </s>
<s> At this point, I'm not sure how we would do that, but since the semantics with XPtr are the same -- something we coordinated on -- does your implementation also require the xptr:here()?  </s>
<s> In the future, I think this is something folks should be cognizant of, but it's not causing an interop problem presently is it?  </s>
<s> Joseph, You are quite correct - my issue at the moment is purely an implementation issue and easily solveable.  </s>
<s> I raised it more from the perspective that it may cause issues in the future.  </s>
<s> The only time that I can see where it might cause an interop problem is if there is another here function defined in the app unlikely?).  </s>
<s> They way around might be to use the XML Signature prefix defined in the doc e.g. (for a Enveloped Signature) count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Signature | dsig:here()/ancestor::dsig:Signature[1]) count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Signature) which would work in my implementation but might break others.  </s>
<s> Maybe something to sort out later once XPath 2.0 is finalised.  </s>
<s> That might drive the issue.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Berin  </s>
