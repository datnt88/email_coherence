<s> we have to process part of a Intranet site.  </s>
<s> How could we process all html files in all subfolders (and 'subsubfolders) at once with HTML Tidy?  </s>
<s> Regards, Thomas  </s>
<s> Depends on your platform.  </s>
<s> If you use the Mac OS versions of Tidy, this is very easy.  </s>
<s> Just drag&amp;drop any files/folders/disks to the GUI versions of Tidy for Mac OS, change any necessary configuration settings, click the "Use now" button, and go... If you want to use a command line version of Tidy for Mac OS, using MPW, you can use the powerful built-in scripting language of MPW, to easily automate the same operation.  </s>
<s> Be aware that I haven't released updated versions of Tidy for Mac OS, based on the current Tidy code.  </s>
<s> For MS-DOS/UN*X platforms, it should be very easy to write a batch file/shell script to automate this procedure with a command line version of Tidy.  </s>
<s> While I could probably suggest such a script, I will leave it to others on those platforms to provide further help - I'm sure this has been solved many times before.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> Depends on your operating system, for example (assuming you want to modify the files in place, backup your files first) Unix: find /intranet/site -name '*.htm*' -exec tidy -m -additional-parameters Windows NT: cd \intranet\site for /r %f in (*.htm*) do tidy -m -additional-parameters %f Windows 9x: Get a port of the Unix "find" command (Cygwin, GNU) Or, generate a list of files using dir /b *.htm*  list.bat  </s>
<s> Edit list.bat by prefixing every line with tidy -m -additional-parameters Terry provided instructions for MacOS already.  </s>

<s> Thanks, as I didn't mention the operation system we are working on (unfortunately for me not a Mac) I will try solutions for UNIX and W2K Regards, Thomas  </s>
