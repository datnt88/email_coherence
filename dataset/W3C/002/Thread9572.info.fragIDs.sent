The publishable version is now at 
This passes the W3C XHTML and CSS validators, and has a whole lot of links added to it. 
There is still one thing to do, which is to 
re-draw figure 2, I'll do that tomorrow after the telecon, OK? . 
Note the final _1. 
Ive left the previous version (of 2 days ago) at the older url in case anyone still wants to check the altered text, which is highlighted in that version. 
(Or you could just go into the header and switch newstuff back on.) 
There are a few tiny rewordings in the above version, nothing super-editorial. 
Pat PS. 
The internal glossary links are colored dark brownish, which seems to my eye to be less intrusive that the surrounding in-line dots that the XML Schema editors used. 
But if this violates any W3C received practices, it wouldn't be hard to change it.

for the moment I have no deep remarks, just that in 3.1 you seem to use "xxx"^^rdf:XMLLiteral@yyy instead of "xxx"@yyy^^rdf:XMLLiteral and in 4.1 similarly "yyy"^^rdf:XMLLiteral@zzz instead of "yyy"@zzz^^rdf:XMLLiteral and while looking for @, we found some in 2 and 3.4 backwards from the @consequent E and to construct a @satisfying rdfs-interpretation 
we also checked the test cases using rdfs:Datatype rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class . 
and that seems to be OK rdfs4a' and rdfs4b' seem to be the same, but I guess you meant rdfs:range in rdfs4b' [will continue later] Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
OK, those are all now fixed.
