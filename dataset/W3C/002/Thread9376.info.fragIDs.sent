<s> This morning I set up a test harness so I could run the RDF Core test cases thru a couple of RDF parsers I had installed (currently ARP, CARA and RDFStore).  </s>
<s> It runs each test case thru a parser that can output N-Triples and then compares the N-Triples results with jena.rdfcompare.  </s>
<s> The results are formatted as simple text with three columns: parser name, result (1 means the results matched, 0 means they didn't, error means an error occurred), and the test name.  </s>
<s> Feel free to include these results in the Test Cases document, and let me know if you have any comments/suggestions to improve the process.  </s>
<s> Also, let me know if you have a parser that outputs N-Triples which you'd like me to test.  </s>
<s> In the end, 86 out of 120 parser-tests succeeded.  </s>
<s> Not bad, I'd say.  </s>

<s> So as far as I recall we no just considered such things as having no defined meaning.  </s>
<s> At present, since we do not describe what applications do with RDF/XML (processing model), we cannot give any requirements on what to do with unknown or undefined tokens.  </s>
<s> Since RDF systems are meant  </s>

<s> If we are not specifying processing behaviour of bad input we do not specify what to do when meeting an attribute with "no meaning".  </s>
<s> The current version of ARP, in good faith, based its processing of rdf:aboutEachPrefix on a particularly reading of para 196 (mine not Dave's!); that processing was not simply ignoring the attribute.  </s>
<s> I suspect that trying to specify the processing of incorrect input is a never-ending task.  </s>
<s> (It seems hard enough to specify the processing of correct input and how to differentiate correct input from incorrect input.) I am not wedded to the current version of ARP, and only use it as an example, since I understand what it does and why!  </s>
