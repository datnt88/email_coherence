<s> Pat, Since http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/ is public and since I'm reading them from time to time, I came across In there, I found (among other comments) It might be salutary and useful if the RDFCore were to spend some time listening to what the ontologists want, instead of telling them what they can have.  </s>
<s> Since I am a member of the RDFCore WG I'm more than glad to listen to the ontologists.  </s>
<s> So what do the ontologists want?  </s>

<s> As another member of the RDFCore WG, I'd like to second the motion.  </s>
<s> At the same time, there's been a fair bit of comment on www-rdf-logic on what RDF lacks that is useful input on this particular issue (as well as both axiomatic and model-theoretic semantics that can provide a good starting point).  </s>

<s> As one of the ontologists, I have quite a number of concerns with RDF, which I have mentioned several times.  </s>
<s> I think, however, that Jonathan Borden did a great summary of what I want, namely: [...] strip out all the stuff from RDF that no one agrees on (such as reification).  </s>
<s> Start with a simple but rock solid foundation, and add concepts in only as absolutely necessary.  </s>
<s> I would also add that I want a firm meaning for everything in RDF, and that includes things like bags and alternatives, if they stay in.  </s>
<s> (I am of the strong belief that bags and alternative do not have any reasonable meaning provided by RDF.) Peter Patel-Schneider From: jos.deroo.jd@belgium.agfa.com  </s>

<s> I can't speak for the ontologists, since I am not one.  </s>
<s> But I can speak for my company's use of references to  </s>
<s> elements in controlled vocabularies.  </s>
<s> We will have lots of statements such as which is a reference to a (hypothetical) node in the NAICS industry sector classification system.  </s>
<s> We need to be able to tell certain things about these statements, such as whether a human has reviewed them, or whether the code was explicitly added or implicitly added because it was a broader term of an explicitly added code.  </s>
<s> One way of accomplishing those needs would be through reification, although the current reification approach seems  </s>
<s> overly cumbersome.  </s>
<s> Perhaps others can suggest other ways of fulfilling those requirements.  </s>
<s> Ron  </s>
<s> Certainly being able to quote statements/triples is useful ... indeed a practical requirement.  </s>
<s> For example I've suggested a quoting syntax for triples using an XPointer extension triple(predicate,subject,object): ex:foo, http://example.org/NAICS/1234 ) This yields a URI which can be discussed as needed.  </s>
<s> The paper: http://www.openhealth.org/RDF/RDFmediatype.html  </s>
<s> some of this still needs to be fleshed out.  </s>
<s> Your comments would be appreciated.  </s>
