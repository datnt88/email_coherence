<s> Is this meant to be in response to: If so, can I draw the WG's attention to the test case examples I posted in: Do we think: 1: this is an RDF problem (i.e. present in the graph) 2: this is an XML problem (i.e. present in the XML serialization only) 3: this is not a problem (e.g. to be addressed, if at all, at the application layer)  </s>

<s> Didn't we agree that there is one kind of literal and it is a triple?  </s>
<s> Having two kinds of literals suggests that we need more than just rdfs:Literal... Perhaps it was the two different NTriples representations suggested that gave an impression of two kinds of literals?  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should have a single consistent NTriples representation such that, the first 'field' is the parseType bit, the second field is the literal string, and the third field is either a language code or '*' and in NTriples syntax, all three fields are manditory: 0-"35"-* 0-"chat"-en 0-"chat"-fr 1-"foo em bar /em bas"-* etc.  </s>
<s> In the case of XML literals, the string would contain whatever canonicalized form is decided upon.  </s>
<s> The XML and N3 serializations can offer syntactic sugar if they like.  </s>
<s> E.g.. N3 can say that if either the first or third field is missing, they default to '0' and '*' respectively, so folks can just write in N3 Bob ex:age "35" .  </s>

<s> Done. Attached is an edited version of Pat's stake-in-the-ground datatyping summary.  </s>
