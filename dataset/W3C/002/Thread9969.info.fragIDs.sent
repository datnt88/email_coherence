<s> Folks, We need to get some of the outstanding test cases reviewed.  </s>
<s> Please can you take a look at  </s>
<s> pick you favourite unreviewed tests and volunteer to review them, preferably by Friday.  </s>
<s> Jan: is there a difference between PENDING and UNAPPROVED?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I have reviewed rdfms-xmllang/test001-test005 and believe they are correct.  </s>
<s> However I am unsure about test006 -- I'd have to do some more careful spec reading to be sure.  </s>
<s> The W3C Validator (ARP) and CARA disagree, although the former may simply have not been updated to support language codes.  </s>
<s> DaveB, could you make two more test cases like test006, but with parseType-and-xml:lang and just parseType?  </s>
<s> I think these would be useful.  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz [http://www.aaronsw.com]  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz said:  </s>
<s> Jeremy has noted a couple of times that the validator needs updating to match more recent RDF Core decisions.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  </s>
<s> test005/test006 tests property attributes without/with xml:lang.  </s>
<s> parseType can't be used in that situation.  </s>
<s> test001 and test002 are the parseType without/with xml:lang for property elements.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> No, except that I've been using "PENDING" because it sounds like a more positive active kind of adjective :-) If test cases are rejected then I'll explicitly record them as "REJECTED" and include a pointer to the decision/discussion.  </s>
<s> jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.  </s>
<s> http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/  </s>
<s> If it's broken really badly - don't fix it either.  </s>
<s> OK, I've been through all the outstanding cases - my comments are below.  </s>
<s> I don't think that any are wrong, but I've raised comments in some cases.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with the UTF-8 mapping &amp;#xFC; -- %C3%BC -- Does agreement on this transform depend on current IRI debates (I've lost track)?  </s>
<s> If we are agreed to have all URIs in the graph use just URI-character-sequences then I think this is right.  </s>
<s> -- Looks OK to me.  </s>
<s> -- Looks OK to me, but I'm not sure what it's meant to demonstrate.  </s>
<s> -- Did we agree xml"foo" as the form for XML literals in N-triples?  </s>
<s> If so, it looks OK to me.  </s>
<s> -- ditto regarding xml"chat"-fr  </s>
<s> -- Looks OK to me.  </s>
<s> -- ditto regarding "chat"-fr -- Looks OK to me.  </s>
<s> -- Interesting case (i.e. good test case!): does xml:lang apply to attributes of the element to which it is applied?  </s>
<s> XML says yes, but that means that the language applies to multiple RDF properties specified as attributes.  </s>
<s> I think that's all OK.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this (rdf:aboutEach is now an error).  </s>
<s> Does the group?  </s>
<s> -- ditto -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> (It would help if the test file contained its URL)  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this. -- Hmmm... I agree that it should be allowed as legal RDF, but is there a case for producing a warning is repeated rdf:_n properties are used?  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> But don't these cases duplicate xmllang tests?  </s>
<s> Does it matter?  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> (I never noticed xml:space before!) (Should there be additional test cases with multiple consecutive whitespace and leading/trailing whitespace with and without the xml:space='preserve' attribute?) -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this, but can't see what it's supposed to be testing.  </s>
<s> Also  </s>
<s> there appears to be some filename confusion with the RDFS entailment tests.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this, and note there appears to be continuing filename confusion.  </s>
<s> -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> given On 7th December 2001, the RDFCore WG decided to remove rdf:aboutEach from the RDF specification.  </s>
<s> ]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach this testcase should be OK  </s>
<s> also given On 1st June 2001, the WG decided that aboutEachPrefix would be removed from the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation on the grounds that there is a lack of implementation experience, and it therefore should not be in the recommendation.  </s>
<s> A future version of RDF may consider support for this feature.  </s>
<s> ]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteachprefix this testcase should be OK as well  </s>
<s> I agree with this one as well only that the MT speaks about rdfs:member as does the http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/ so an update is in order I think  </s>
<s> Also  </s>
<s> tests.  </s>
<s> looking at the main point is actually the "Positive RDFS-Entailment test" and the "Positive parser tests" are not testing this specific issue I think the whole idea should be to approve  </s>
<s> my recollection is that we have approved this one and that DanC and PatH agreed for the issue I have done i.e. 4 positive and 2 negative entailment tests this is indeed RDFS and OWL entailment (in our original etc mode) and I didn't know how to testcase this issue otherwise Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
