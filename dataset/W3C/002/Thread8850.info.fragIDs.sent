<s> Is it reasonable to have a standard transform of "binary" available, analogous to the existing "base64" transform?  </s>

<s> You can of course use XML Signature to sign a PKCS#7 blob just like you can any other blob.  </s>
<s> But I think the implication of your email is that you are looking for some standard specified way of combining PKCS#7 and XML  </s>
<s> Signature.  </s>
<s> There isn't any.  </s>
<s> Generally, XML Signature should be seen as the new way of doing digital signatures.  </s>
<s> It may make sense to port existing PKCS#7-based applications to XML Signature, but I doubt there would be any value trying to have a single digital signature be a hybrid of both XML Signature and PKCS#7.  </s>

<s> I'm didn't say that XML Signature is necessarily a replacement for PKCS#7.  </s>
<s> What I am saying is that XML Signature is "the new way of doing digital signatures" and that if one is introducing digital signatures into a system, one should seriously consider using XML Signature over PKCS#7.  </s>
<s> Certainly, if a system is heavily ASN.1-oriented and where the subset of digital signature functionality available in PKCS#7 is deemed satisfactory for the foreseeable future, and the implementors really want to use PKCS#7, I will not object.  </s>
<s> There may indeed be cases where PKCS#7 remains preferable.  </s>
<s> But, in general (eg.  </s>
<s> not always), I think XML Signature should be initially assumed to be the best alternative until proven otherwise for application-layer security.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I am misreading your email, but are you stating you don't think XML Signature can sign binary data without adding a "binary" transform?  </s>
<s> If so, I should point out that XML Signature today can sign binary data, and that no "binary" transform is necessary.  </s>
<s> Indeed, the great thing is that a single XML Signature can cover mulitple binary objects (either referenced or enveloped (and base64-ed)).  </s>
