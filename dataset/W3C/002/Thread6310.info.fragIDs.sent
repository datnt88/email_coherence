<s> What happened to the "site-comments" link on the homepage?  </s>
<s> There's no way to find that list from either the 'webmaster' link at the bottom or the 'Contact' link at the top and bottom -- is there?  </s>

<s> Still there.  </s>
<s> I moved it to "Send comments about this page" under "Get involved"  </s>
<s> If you didn't find it, I don't know whether that means that it's not findable, or that you were looking elsewhere and thus assumed it was missing.  </s>
<s> I moved it up in the page since otherwise it was buried at the bottom.  </s>

<s> Ah, there it is.  </s>
<s> I think it may be a case of both; I was looking in a specific place, but then it's actually the most common place (in my experience) for someone to look for a "site feedback" link -- at the bottom of the page.  </s>
<s> If you leave it where it is, you should at least link to it from the Contact and Webmaster pages.  </s>
<s> Those are where people skimming the page are (in my experience) most likely to look.  </s>
