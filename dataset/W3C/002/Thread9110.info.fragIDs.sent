One of the advantage of XMLDSIG over PKCS, I read, is the textual format instead of binary ASN.1 format. 
But when it comes to certificates, it is still X.509 
certificate which is in binary format. 
So for a box to support XMLDSIG, it needs to have both XML parser as well as ASN.1 parser isnt' it. 
I understand using XKMS this validation can be ofloaded to a key management system. 
But if a box has to do all the validation itself, then does it require both XML &amp; ASN.1 parser to validate certificates isnt it.

Yes, I've been calling this the "Frankenstein Complex" for a little over a year now I think. 
Generally yes -- unless they use XKMS, or use a native XKMS cert format. 
There's a NWI proposal under ballot in the ISO TC68/SC2 security group that if approved will define an all XML markup certificate based on the schema defined in ANSI X9.68.

You could use RSA key values and SAML for authentication. 
If you want to interoperate with existing PKI, then yes, you basically have to do ASN.1. 
But an all-XML approach might be better.
