For me, the phrase "to test the capabilities of" misled me. 
I assumed this meant that any capability added to the server, such as support for WebDAV methods even in some limited namespaces, must be advertised in OPTIONS * as a capability. 
Since this assumption isn't backed up by implementation reality, the HTTP text could be something like: 
If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource. 
Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method. 
For example, this 
can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 support (or lack thereof).

Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server. 
For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof). 
So there seems to be some assumption that HTTP/1.1 compliance has something to do with implementing OPTIONS (otherwise how could it be used as a test for HTTP/1.1 compliance?). 
Regardless of whether or not you get an error (or even which one you get), you still get the servers claimed HTTP version in the response line. 
I'm not sure what more that paragraph needs to say, or 
what's unclear 
about it. 
What confuses people is probably that the text says "to test for compliance" rather than saying "to detect HTTP version". 
Since most HTTP/1.1 implementations are not HTTP/1.1 compliant but are using HTTP/1.1 version, the two statements are different. 
HTH, Alex. 
Are people happy with Lisa's suggested solution? 
I would replace "test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 support (or lack thereof)" with a more well-defined "test a proxy for OPTIONS method support (or lack thereof)".

There has been 
no comment to date. 
Essentially, she suggests deleting the words "it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server" from the specification. 
I'd like to get a draft issued. 
Though I've tried for perfection on my first try, my experience is it is likely that at least one more draft will have to be done before full standard, as, at a minimum, the chances of getting all the changes decreed by IESG process changes right on the first try seems unlikely to me.
