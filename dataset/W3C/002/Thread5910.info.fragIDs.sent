<s> Graduated degrees of "contract-ness": * A choreography as a technical contract, as in Design By Contract.  </s>

<s> Assaf Arkin:  </s>
<s> product  </s>
<s> failed  </s>
<s> You can't prove a negative.  </s>
<s> You can claim that goods or money was not received and the respondent can rebut with message logs.  </s>
<s> You can claim that a payment was late, especially if it was electronic and you have a good timestamp.  </s>
<s> Or say that an economic contract contains two commitments: 1. a commitment to deliver some goods by a particular time, and 2. a commitment to pay a penalty for late delivery.  </s>
<s> Evidence that the supplier agreed to both of those commitments would be necessary to claim the penalty.  </s>
<s> Probably the more business protocols get automated, and good evidence is available, the less people will sue, and the more they will fulfill their commitments.  </s>
<s> A public record of commitment-fulfillment could also become a basis for a reputation system.  </s>
<s> Catching up on some emails ... This whole thread about contracts and how choreographies relate to them is interesting, but I also don't think it is particularly relevant to the work of this group ... maybe I'm wrong.  </s>
<s> WHY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RELEVANT The basic idea behind any contract is that there is an exchange of "value" (as in the economic contract).  </s>
<s> E.g you will provide the goods if I give you the money.  </s>
<s> However there can also be an agreement or contract surrounding the exchange of "value", the complexity of which can vary.  </s>
<s> For example, it can be simple: you give $0.25c to a street vendor in the expectation that they will provide you with the news paper you requested; to complex: where you specify exactly what the goods or service will be, how they will be delivered, when they will be delivered, who will deliver them, what the remedies are if something goes wrong, etc, etc.  </s>
<s> So in some contracts "how the service is delivered" could include reference to the choreography definition used, although this is but *one* of many other factors that can describe the "how".  </s>
<s> You can also choreography definitions can exist without a contract.  </s>
<s> For example, the fact you can have the architectural plans for building a house doesn't mean that anyone is committed to building the house for you.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, any reasonable house building contract will always reference the architectural plans to be used.  </s>
<s> You could even get multiple house building contracts that reference the same building plans.  </s>
<s> So really I see a choreography definition as something that a contract would use, rather than the other way round, so as long as we include ways by which a contract definition be referenced by a contract, probably by requiring that each definition is identified with a URI, then that is all we need to be able to do.  </s>
<s> Assaf also mentions whether you need to reference the contract in the contract in the FedEx slip.  </s>
<s> The answer is probably no because of the many different ways in which business can get done which usually leads to a degree of indirection between the documents used in every day business and the legal agreements that go with them.  </s>
<s> Here are a few examples ... IMPLICIT TERMS CONTRACT An individual goes along to FedEx and asks them to ship some goods.  </s>
<s> Typically in doing this you will get a receipt which tells you where you can get the FedEx published terms of use, or perhaps there is a sign displayed on the wall.  </s>
<s> By paying the amount and FedEx accepting the goods for delivery, the individual is implicitly accepting those published terms.  </s>
<s> Also the terms usually say that they can be changed from time to time, therefore it is important to know when the transactions were entered into to work out excactly agreement was in force.  </s>
<s> Either way, there is no need to reference the terms on any of the documentation.  </s>
<s> CALL-OFF CONTRACT Perhaps FedEx is providing a logistics service to deliver goods.  </s>
<s> In this case there will be a one-off contract which, if it is sensible will include things like price as well as service-levels etc that apply.  </s>
<s> In this case, determining the contract that applies to any shipment only needs to know who the parties involved are and the date and time, again there is no need to identify the contract by number.  </s>
<s> ONE-OFF CONTRACT You might also have an individual contract that applies to an Order or a set of Orders.  </s>
<s> In this case, the Order would reference the Contract, and the Invoice, Shipment Notice, etc would reference the Order and therefore, indirectly the Contract.  </s>
