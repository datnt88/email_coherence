<s> Hi, I would like to know whether with webdav there is any provision to advertising the shares available on a given server?  </s>
<s> The idea, with the, conjunction of a technology such as Rendezvous, would be to list the servers with 'shares' in local area and then list the webdav resources being made available by the server.  </s>
<s> regards Andre  </s>
<s> Ander, No, there isn't.  </s>
<s> It would be nice tho'.  </s>

<s> If this indeed the case, maybe this is something that should be examined?  </s>
<s> Maybe a simple solution to this (note - two second analysis ;) would be an XML file at the root.  </s>
<s> The file would have a standard name, maybe something such as webdav.xml and would list the shares: guest="yes"/ The server would have the option of dynamically changing the published xml file depending on whether the file was request with a user name or without.  </s>
<s> With this in mind, any client should probably support a redirection to another URL which provides the data - this is in order to allow retrofitting of this functionality to existing servers, and maybe even indicating that the server has been moved?  </s>
<s> Although there is probably a lot that could be done, hopefully this should serve as a seed for future work?  </s>
<s> Andre  </s>
<s> There's another potential technology for this kind of thing besides Rendezvous: the Service Location Protocol.  </s>
<s> It's not exactly the same, but it's useful in its own way.  </s>
