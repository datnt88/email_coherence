<s> [Admin: URI of 'raised' message in this Issue is wrong, should be: In RDF's XML syntax, there are ways to express statements and to give IDs to the resources modelling the statements (reified statements).  </s>
<s> However when using the form in the first attachment to this message [cloaked as text/html until archive bug is fixed] - a statement generated by a property which points at an object using the rdf:resource attribute, it generates a statement (s,p,o form) (http://blah/, http://somewhere/bar , http://foobar) and should identify a resource modelling the statement with ID foobar (URI [attached example URI]foobar) However, at present propertyElt production 6.12 forbids both ID and rdf:resource attributes: [6.12] propertyElt ::= ... other alternatives ...  </s>

<s> (ignoring any future changes to the way the grammar may be expressed and changes to add rdf: prefixes) A related change also required is the wording near the end of section 6 in item #3 of the list: [[Specifically; each propertyElt start tag containing attribute specifications other than ID, resource, bagID, xml:lang, or any attribute starting with the characters xmlns results in the creation of the triples {p,r1,r2}, {pa1,r2,va1}, ..., {pan,r2,van} where 1. p is the expansion of the namespace-qualified tag name.  </s>
<s> 2. r1 is the resource being referred to by the element containing this propertyElt expression.  </s>
<s> 3. r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new resource.  </s>
<s> If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new resource.  </s>
<s> 4. pa1 ... pan are the expansion of the namespace-qualified attribute names.  </s>
<s> 5. va1 ... van are the corresponding attribute values.  </s>

<s> The phrase [[If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new resource.]]  </s>
<s> needs to change for three reasons: 1.  </s>
<s> Earlier on in section 6, RDF M&amp;S says [[Within propertyElt (production [6.12]), the URI used in a resource attribute identifies (after resolution) the resource that is the object of the statement (i.e., the value of this property).  </s>
<s> The value of the ID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the resource that represents the reification of the statement.  </s>
<s> ]] middle of section 6, http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/  </s>
<s> So this is inconsistent.  </s>
<s> 2. Everywhere else, the ID attribute names the reified statement - so this is inconsistent again.  </s>
<s> 3. The rdf:resource attribute is the identifer of the new resource (when using the form described here); otherwise it is the enclosed resource provided by the other alternatives in the 6.12 production.  </s>
<s> Proposed Fix #2 Change the sentence at the end of section 6 item #3 with the last sentence quoted above from earlier on in section 6 OR removed the sentence.  </s>
<s> Impact on Applications Removes an ambiguity, makes the grammar more regular, probably minimal.  </s>
<s> I suspect most parsers do Dave, who spent far too much time reading RDF M&amp;S grammars.  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz said:  </s>
<s> The confusion is the different interpretation of rdf:ID in propertyElt when the element is empty / non-empty.  </s>
<s> It was my understanding that the issue was the fact that statements using resources as objects could not be reified.  </s>
<s> No - the original issue had a specific question which I refered to, quoted, and answered in my message: I was not answering the different issue above.  </s>
<s> But the grammar does not allow this because of the (somewhat unexpected and little-known) usage of ID to name a new property.  </s>
<s> Along with Jan Grant's proposal for removing the creation of new resources on empty propElts, I think that the use of ID to name them should also be removed.  </s>
<s> Thus your option 2 would always be the case.  </s>
<s> I feel that removing this existing syntax is too much of a change, although I did give my misgivings about its function and clarity in my message.  </s>
<s> In IRC later, Aaron noted there was a way to do what he wanted which was also in the original issue description Dave  </s>
<s> Brian McBride said:  </s>
<s> In case #1 (empty element) since rdf:ID points to the target resource, adding rdf:resource as well would have two statement objects which does not make sense.  </s>
<s> I'm not following you here Dave.  </s>
<s> rdf:Description foo:bar rdf:ID="rs" foobar /foo:bar /rdf:Desscription is clearly legal and the rdf:ID attribute defines the URI of the refied statement the property represents.  </s>
<s> This is legal and I agree with this as it is a non-empty element; I already described this.  </s>
<s> The question that arises is whether rdf:Description foo:bar rdf:resource="http://foo/" rdf:ID="rs"/ /rdf:Description is legal, with again the rdf:ID attribute defining the URI of the reifed statement.  </s>
<s> It does seem a bit irregular to allow the use of an rdf:ID attribute to identify the reifed statement in the case where the object is a literal, but not in the case where it is a resource.  </s>
<s> And strictly speaking, the grammar does not rule it out as the rdf:resource attribute matches the idAboutAttr?  </s>
<s> in the production and the rdf:ID attribute matches the propAttr*.  </s>
<s> No. The propertyElt rule 6.12 does not use idAboutAttr anywhere (and indeed that production 6.5 also does not allow rdf:resource) [6.12] propertyElt ::= ' ' propName idAttr?  </s>
<s> ' ' value ' /' propName ' '  </s>

<s> parseResource ' '  </s>
<s> propertyElt* ' /' propName ' '  </s>
<s> ' ' propName idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> bagIdAttr?  </s>
<s> propAttr* '/ '  </s>
<s> The above is an empty element so only matches the production 6.12 part 4 above where things allowed are: idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of idRefAttr) AND bagIDAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of bagIDfAttr) AND propAttr* = (0 or more of propAttr) expanding: idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of (idAttr | resourceAttr)) AND bagIDAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of (bagID="' IDsymbol '"')) AND propAttr* = (0 or more of (typeAttr | propName '="' string '"')) again: idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of (' ID="' IDsymbol '"' | ' resource="' URI-reference '"')) AND bagIDAttr?  </s>
<s> = (0 or 1 of (bagID="' IDsymbol '"')) AND propAttr* = (0 or more of ( type="' URI-reference '"' | propName '="' string '"')) Now (IGNORE namespace prefix stuff here) has an rdf:ID and an rdf:resource.  </s>
<s> These are not properties but syntax devices so do not match the propAttr rule, although they do match the syntax - maybe this is where you are diverging from me.  </s>
<s> Aside 1: Parsers will continue having to look for resource/rdf:resource and other things as special cases, so they will not match general properties.  </s>
<s> Aside 2: these don't apply to the built-in rdf properties which do match propName.  </s>
<s> We know RDF syntax has issues.  </s>
<s> These RDF properties that do match propName are: rdf:type (in grammar too) rdf:value rdf:subject rdf:predicate rdf:object [maybe rdf:li rdf_ n but that's an issue yet to discuss] Thus rdf:ID and rdf:resource can only match the first part idRefAttr?  </s>
<s> where they are alternatives and hence having both is not legal.  </s>
<s> Both the rdf:ID and rdf:resource in this case are used to point to the object of the statement, not the reification of the statement, and as I previously discussed although this is inconsistent with the normal use of rdf:ID, changing it may be break too many things.  </s>
