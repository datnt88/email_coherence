<s> Hi WSDL-attribute-ers, Monday works for me but can we make it 12:30 instead of 12:00?  </s>
<s> If it has to be 12:00 then I will be late some days.  </s>

<s> So lets go with a new "strawman", 12:00-1:00 Eastern on  </s>

<s> If  </s>
<s> you are interested, please go ahead and subscribe [1] and  </s>
<s> welcome to the  </s>
<s> "Attributes Task Force".  </s>
<s> For more details on the initial  </s>
<s> proposal as  </s>
<s> presented in Rennes, please see [2].  </s>
<s> Some notes on the Attributes Task Force: Purpose: In the context of "stateful Web services", there is a need  </s>
<s> to model, as  </s>
<s> part of the WSDL definition of the service, the elements of  </s>
<s> the publicly  </s>
<s> available state made available to the service requestor.  </s>
<s> OGSI[5] has the  </s>
<s> notion of "serviceData".  </s>
<s> CORBA IDL has attributes [4].  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> task force is  </s>
<s> formed to explore how to model a Web service's state in WSDL.  </s>
<s> Scope: Review and refine the initial proposal made in Rennes.  </s>
<s> Report back to the  </s>
<s> Web services description working group by the July 31  </s>
<s> face-to-face in  </s>
<s> Toronto.  </s>
<s> Currently, this Task Force is for members of the  </s>
<s> Web services  </s>
<s> description working group only.  </s>
<s> We can expand  </s>
<s> participation based on the  </s>
<s> chair's approval (Jonathan Marsh).  </s>
<s> Inputs: Initial proposal [2], WebDAV[3], Corba attributes[4], OGSI (serviceData)[5].  </s>
<s> Deliverables: A proposal on how to proceed.  </s>
<s> Should "attributes" be  </s>
<s> standardized at all?  </s>
<s> Should this be core WSDL 1.2?  </s>
<s> An optional module?  </s>
<s> Some  </s>
<s> other standards  </s>
<s> body?  </s>
<s> Approach: We will use the mailing list (public-ws-desc-state@w3.org)  </s>
<s> and a weekly  </s>
<s> telecon.  </s>
<s> Current "strawman" proposal for the weekly  </s>
<s> telecon is Tuesdays  </s>
<s> 11:00am-12:00 EST, starting Tuesday, May 27 with our initial call.  </s>
<s> The time between now and July 31 is tight but doable.  </s>
