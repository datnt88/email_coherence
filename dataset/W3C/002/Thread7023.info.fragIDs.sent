<s> Sadly, many projects are following WebDAV's example of defining a special URI scheme just for the purpose of identiying their namespaces.  </s>
<s> In the case of WebDAV (RFC2518), the scheme was at least registered, and the official errata document recognizes this as a valid issue with the protocol.  </s>
<s> Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org)  </s>
<s> sadly is doing the same thing -- it defines a new URI scheme ("svn:") for internal identifiers which now shows up as XML namespace both in internal files (entries files for instance) and in external marshalling (WebDAV request/response bodies).  </s>
<s> It would be nice if this would be fixed before they reach 1.0.  </s>
<s> The issue has certainly been raised but was rejected by their respective developers.  </s>

<s> I fully agree with Julian.  </s>
<s> I just have seen some other such examples in the jabber protocol at the IETF BOF, and have pointed this out as a mistake.  </s>
<s> I propose that we add something like this to the XML guidelines (http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hollenbeck-ietf-xml-guidelines-05.  </s>
<s> txt), just before 4.8.1: "Although there are some examples where this has been done in the past, specifications MUST NOT create new URI schemes to define namespaces."  </s>
