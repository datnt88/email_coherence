<s> In response to producing an X.509 CRL example, I just wanted to note that I really don't like the lack of harmony in our definition of CRL handling within X.509 data.  </s>
<s> Forcing the CRL to be placed in a separate X.509 data element from the corresponding certificate material simply makes the process of identifying association harder.  </s>
<s> Additionally, the restriction to just a single CRL per X.509 data makes the handling of delta CRLs very unwieldy; we wind up with a bunch of different X.509 data, where one would be much more straightforward.  </s>
<s> I note that in the thread: (and others) several people have argued for more flexibility with the CRL, but I've yet to find the argument that was made against this flexibility...  </s>
<s> For reference, I'd like the definition to be simply This imposes no constraints other than our verbal ones.  </s>

<s> Hi Merlin, I agree with you and believe I have argued that way in the past.  </s>
<s> The current syntax may be left over from much earlier when X509Data was limited to one certificate.  </s>
<s> Unless there are significant objections, I think we should adopt your suggestion.  </s>
