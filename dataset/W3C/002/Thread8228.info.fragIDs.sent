<s> Hello, The current WebDAV specifications deal with a transactional support on a method base only.  </s>
<s> Either a single WebDAV method is completely and successfully executed, or the method is not executed at all (e.g. a PropPatch command will either modify all requested properties or none of them).  </s>
<s> A transactional support spanning multiple WebDAV methods is currently not specified.  </s>
<s> Multi user requirements are either handled in separate workspaces (Delta-V) or via the Lock method.  </s>
<s> During our discussion on the JSR 170 (Content Management API) implementation on top of WebDAV, we believe that we require longer transactions spanning multiple separate WebDAV methods.  </s>
<s> (This issue was already partially discussed in the Batch method thread).  </s>
<s> Do you also fell the need/requirement to get a standard on the way, concerning a transactional WebDAV protocol extension?  </s>
<s> A possible use case would be: An author wants to modify an html page.  </s>
<s> To successfully do so, he will PUT the updated html page back, PROPPATCH and UNLOCK it, DELETE all bitmap  </s>
<s> files, which are not references any more, and PUT (create) the newly referenced bitmaps files.  </s>
<s> If he wants to ensure, that either all his changes do apply (or none of them) he would surround those method call with an TA-BEGIN and a TA-COMMIT method call.  </s>
<s> If the author would be an API (e.g. JSR 170) exposing the TA functionality to an application, we believe this feature to be mandatory.  </s>
<s> A possible (starting) specification could be: WebDAV defines 3 additional methods: TA-BEGIN, TA-COMMIT and TA-ABORT.  </s>
<s> The TA-BEGIN method will return a TA token (e.g. via an XML response body).  </s>
<s> This TA token will be send to the following WebDAV methods, which are part of this transaction (e.g. via an additional header).  </s>
<s> The TA-COMMIT or TA-ABORT method will either commit or abort the transaction and invalidate the TA token.  </s>
<s> If and when an open TA, which is not used any more, is aborted, could be controlled similar to the lock method timeout header.  </s>
<s> All WebDAV methods, which either do not posses a TA token, or posses an invalid token are handled as today (the method is executed within its own TA), this would ensure upward compatibility.  </s>
<s> This extension would be optional, if a server supports the TA methods, it  </s>
<s> will state this in the OPTIONS request (similar to Delta-V).  </s>
<s> Does this make sense?  </s>
<s> Best regards Juergen Pill  </s>
<s> One thing you do NOT want under any circumstances are begin-transaction, end-transaction, and abort-transaction methods.  </s>
<s> That approach simply does not scale beyond a single user, and is a performance disaster.  </s>
<s> You absolutely need to stick to single method calls that can Perform Multiple operations on the server in a single Transaction.  </s>
<s> Batching up operations is a valid approach.  </s>
<s> Transactions aren't that easy to deal with.  </s>
<s> That becomes Even more true when multiple servers are involved.  </s>
<s> Someday, WebDAV might get that far.  </s>
<s> Transactions aren't new.  </s>
<s> They're decades old.  </s>
<s> The effort would Profit from the decades of thought that has gone before.  </s>
<s> For example, see the DMA standard for one approach.  </s>
<s> (But remember: DMA specifies an API, not a protocol, and WebDAV is a protocol.) Dr. Alan F. Babich  </s>
<s> Hi, one thing that the participants of the interop meeting may want to consider...  </s>
<s> A long time ago ([1]), Microsoft proposed a live property DAV:ishidden which signals that a resource should be displayed as hidden in a UI. Support currently exists in: MS IIS 5.0: reports DAV:ishidden according to the file system flags of the underlying file system MS webfolder client: asks for DAV:ishidden, and hides the resource when it is reported as hidden SAP Enterprise Portal Server: treats DAV:ishidden as live property with the semantics defined in [1] I think this is a really useful feature, and in case we can identify another client that supports it, we may want to roll it into RFC2518.  </s>
<s> Regards, Julian [1] http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt  </s>
<s> If this were part of the standard, I'd certainly want to support it.  </s>
<s> Mac OS X creates some files which are intended to be hidden (being UNIX based, Mac OS X hides files which begin with a "." character) and so a standard WebDAV property to indicate that a file is supposed to be hidden would be welcome.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Are any other of the Microsoft proposed extensions of general interest?  </s>
<s> They have a property like "has-children" or something as well, I believe, that they use... --Eric  </s>
