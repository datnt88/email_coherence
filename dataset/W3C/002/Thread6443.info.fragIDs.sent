<s> I observe that since about 10 April, messages sent to me from the RDFcore mailing list no longer include an X-archived-at header.  </s>
<s> I have found this to be an *extremely* useful feature, as it allows me to easily locate URIs for messages that I want to mention.  </s>
<s> The alternative for me is to hunt though the online archives using a slow Internet connection, a most tedious process.  </s>
<s> I strongly urge the systems team to reinstate the X-archived-at header for messages from W3C mailing lists.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I don't think we have made any related changes, and that header is still present on messages I receive from W3C lists.  </s>
<s> Maybe your mail client stopped showing them, or a gateway started stripping them?  </s>
<s> (can someone else on w3c-rdfcore-wg confirm those headers are still present?)  </s>

<s> You're right, and I apologize for any distraction I may have caused.  </s>
<s> I've been having a few email-related problems recently, and while I thought I'd allowed for the effect of these, I now realize that it was a bunch of messages that came to me by a different route that were missing the most-useful X-archived-at header.  </s>
<s> Now I'm getting service-as-normal again, I'm also getting the headers.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your attention.  </s>
