I'd be interested to see what URI people think of:

Oh my goodness! 
It's an unecoded URI without a scheme name!

I would suggest that the syntax be modified to fit into the URI generic syntax[1]. 
for example, dotgnu.org:spell:"I wnt to chke my, speeling" becomes rsl://dotgnu.org:spell:"I%20wnt%20to%20chke%20my,%20speeling" 
I would suggest it directly to the authors of the rls.htm document if that document made their email addresses handy ;-) I'd appreciate it if anybody who is in contact with them would pass my suggestion along to them. 
I was briefed on some aspects of the .NET 
design by one of the designers a while ago; when he got to the part where one "assembly" points to another, I immediately asked if they're using URIs for that. 
He reported, with regret, that the pointer is just a string. 
That leaves open the possibility of using URIs, but does not mandate it. 
He had argued to use URIs explicitly, but accepted a decision to use plain strings. 
I think the .NET 
design has a lot of good features... the Modula-3 guys got a lot of things right; Java borrowed some, but .NET borrows even more of the right things. 
.NET 
seems to be less constraining than Java and Corba in some important ways. 
(in particular, in the design of the root of the object system, which see my unfinished article "Corba is not Mimally Constraining" $Id: oop-min.html,v

But I hope that the result will be integrated with URIs and the Web, not in competition.
