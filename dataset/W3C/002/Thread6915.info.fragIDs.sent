<s> I would suggest that the syntax be modified to fit into the URI generic syntax[1].  </s>

<s> He reported, with regret, that the pointer is just a string.  </s>
<s> That leaves open the possibility of using URIs, but does not mandate it.  </s>
<s> He had argued to use URIs explicitly, but accepted a decision to use plain strings.  </s>
