Hello again, This is in reference to ml?rev=1.64 
I was under the impression that the verbs "delimit" and "separate" were slightly different concepts, but the spec seems to use the terms rather interchangeably. 
Delimiters are usually bounding a discrete type of item on both sides, such as the quotes around attribute values in HTML/XML, whereas separators are things that are interposed between items in a series, such as the slashes in a path. 
I suggest being more consistent with these terms throughout the spec.

Can you suggest specific edits where changing the current language would make the sense of the specification clearer? 
Such as you provided in the case of the 'path component'? 
It is plausible to consider that both terminators and separators are delimiters. 
The above remark is perhaps unnecessarily biased toward 
flat partitions as regards taxonomy, as well as unenforceably vague as regards the draft. 
I think we would have to see concrete evidence of actual damage (to comprehensibility) to get a consensus behind a change. 
But most of us have been re-reading this language too many times to perceive where it is impenetrable. 
Fresh eyes such as yours are very helpful under the circumstances.

OK, I'll grep through it again and suggest edits. 
I look at it like this: a terminator or separator, especially in linear data, does not necessarily offset a piece of data from all other adjacent data, which is what I perceive the role of a delimiter to be; it just gives you a way to distinguish between what data precedes and what data follows the separator itself, which may or may not be enough information to identify a finite range. 
Feel free to take this with a grain of salt. 
It's just that I've been scolded in the past (by people with far more experience and knowledge than me, though of course that doesn't necessarily mean they're right) for not using a stricter definition of delimiter. 
IIRC, I had written "comma delimited values" and was told that there's a reason it should be "comma separated values" instead, and 
not just because there happens to be a popular spreadsheet export format that uses a filename extension based on the initials of the latter phrase. 
No one seems to be at each other's throats about it, but there are definitely 
two camps: those who distinguish between delimiters &amp; separators, and those 
who don't or just don't care. 
When you publish something with the longevity of an RFC, you are going to have an influence on how many people in the future fall into one camp or the other -- language is dynamic and is defined by how we use it, over time. 
Instead of saying "yeah it's a little fuzzy, but what's the harm?", instead ask "do we want to help define these terms through our usage of them, or do we want to leave them more open to interpretation, come what may?" We've seen what happens when a term like "resource" isn't nailed down. 
What seems like a harmless ambiguity now could become a bigger issue years in the future. 
Well, I don't claim to "know" anything :) Take it all with a grain of salt. 
Thanks for taking the time to hear my concerns, at least.

A delimiter marks the beginning or end of a unit of data. 
A separator separates two units of data. 
In CSV, for instance, a line containing a single comma represents two empty units of data. 
A separator is therefore a bidirectional delimiter. 
rfc2396bis uses the term delimiter correctly. 
Some of them are being used as separators, but they also delimiters.
