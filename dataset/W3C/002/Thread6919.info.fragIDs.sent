<s> Hi, urn:ietf:id:draft-masinter-url-i18n-07 (btw, it expires soon, how is  </s>
<s> a new draft going?) introduceses IRIs.  </s>
<s> Is it expectable, that IRIs replace URIs since they are completly covered by IRIs?  </s>
<s> I.e., will future (X)HTML, XML, HTTP, etc.pp.  </s>
<s> versions (if any) use IRIs and the term URI will only be used when talking about backward compatibility?  </s>

<s> There are some minor edits, but more to the point, there was a lengthy comment from Leslie Daigle (I think it is W3C Member-only right now, unfortunately).  </s>
<s> I don't think there's any chance that IRIs will "obsolete" URIs in any meaningful sense, even if the IRI draft were to be approved (which it has not been).  </s>

<s> How will me mere mortals access what he wrote?  </s>
<s> So how and where do you expected IRIs to be used and implemented?  </s>
<s> For example, XLink 1.0 was just approved as recommendation (based on URIs), if one could not expect IRIs to be used in e.g. XLink 2.0, I have small hope that they could be used in upcoming XHTML versions.  </s>

<s> Hello Bjoern, Please check XLink (1.0!) again.  </s>
<s> It does not use the term IRI (because that's still a draft), but you will see that the content of xlink:href can indeed be an IRI.  </s>
<s> The XLink spec also has some nice examples; it's a pity that RFCs and Internet Drafts make it difficult to use actual implementations.  </s>
<s> Please also check XML Schema.  </s>
<s> There is a type called anyURI (the name is mainly political), which also can be an IRI (although again it doesn't say so).  </s>
<s> A simple way to explain things is that everything is working together except for me who is way behind on updating the various drafts.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
