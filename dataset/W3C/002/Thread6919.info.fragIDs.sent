Hi, urn:ietf:id:draft-masinter-url-i18n-07 (btw, it expires soon, how is 
a new draft going?) introduceses IRIs. 
Is it expectable, that IRIs replace URIs since they are completly covered by IRIs? 
I.e., will future (X)HTML, XML, HTTP, etc.pp. 
versions (if any) use IRIs and the term URI will only be used when talking about backward compatibility?

There are some minor edits, but more to the point, there was a lengthy comment from Leslie Daigle (I think it is W3C Member-only right now, unfortunately). 
I don't think there's any chance that IRIs will "obsolete" URIs in any meaningful sense, even if the IRI draft were to be approved (which it has not been).

How will me mere mortals access what he wrote? 
So how and where do you expected IRIs to be used and implemented? 
For example, XLink 1.0 was just approved as recommendation (based on URIs), if one could not expect IRIs to be used in e.g. XLink 2.0, I have small hope that they could be used in upcoming XHTML versions.

Hello Bjoern, Please check XLink (1.0!) again. 
It does not use the term IRI (because that's still a draft), but you will see that the content of xlink:href can indeed be an IRI. 
The XLink spec also has some nice examples; it's a pity that RFCs and Internet Drafts make it difficult to use actual implementations. 
Please also check XML Schema. 
There is a type called anyURI (the name is mainly political), which also can be an IRI (although again it doesn't say so). 
A simple way to explain things is that everything is working together except for me who is way behind on updating the various drafts. 
Regards, Martin.
