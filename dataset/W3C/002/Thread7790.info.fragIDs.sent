Hi, Are there any DAV clients that do a proppatch? 
I have been looking for an example of a proppatch in action. 
Thanks, -David 
Sanity check: have you seen the PROPPATCH example in the RFC?

If you know Python, then you can also grab my davlib.py and httplib.py 
(via links at www.webdav.org/mod_dav/). 
Using that, you can generate a PROPPATCH to your server.
