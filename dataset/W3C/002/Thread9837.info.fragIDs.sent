Brian-- Unfortunately, but speaking realistically, as a Primer Editor I don't think I can commit to this schedule (I can work very hard to meet it, of course, but I can't honestly commit to it). 
It allows 3 weeks to a last call WD when we've just now got the first WD out, and I'm going to be out of town during much of one of those weeks (at a technical workshop, so it's unlikely I'll be doing a lot of work in the evenings, and it's at a resort [blast it!], so I'm not sure what kind of Internet access I'll have anyway). 
Regarding "holidays or other outages", I don't know about any of the other Americans in the group, but I still have my tax returns to do (April 15 is the deadline). 
"Outage" is a good word to describe that process; it sure doesn't count as a "holiday"!. --Frank
