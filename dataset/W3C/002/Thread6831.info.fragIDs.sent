As a Co-Chair of a joint IETF/W3C WG, I was thinking that it would be quite 
nice if the W3C and IETF agreed on a common specification schema/DTD. 
(This 
could make my life easier when I find a WYSIWYG XML/CSS editor I'm happy with for editing specs! 
smile ) Marshall, the efforts at the W3C [1] to date have been informal within the 
XML activity and on the spec-prod list [2]. 
However, the folks involved have 
come up with quite a nice DTD [3]. 
What is the status of usage/deployment of 
your Informational RFC on a schema/DTD for RFCs and have you seen [4]? 
Any interest in harmonizing/subsetting/profiling? 
And then there's always the XSLT option... [1] http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SGML/spec-mgmt.html [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/ [3] http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19980910.htm [4] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2629.txt

I'm happy to collaborate on designing a joint DTD. 
I have a suspicion that 
the header requirements are pretty different, but this could be modularized. 
In fact, there's already a parameter entity in the XMLspec 
DTD that allows you to substitute your own stuff. 
Please note that the latest XMLspec information is at the following locations: (I think there may be something funny going on with the "latest version" links provided in the documentation, so stick with the specific V2.1 links for now.)

This is actually what I'm most interested in. 
If you are writing a W3C spec, you don't have to worry about the expires field. 
If you are writing an IETF spec you don't have to worry about the latest version field. 
But if you are writing for both it's easy (one document, two XSLTs), and it'll pool our experiences in writing a spec schema/dtd for everything else. 
I started my unsuccessful path in finding the latest version at: which states: 
# "http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/DTD/xmlspec.dtd" 
For all details, see the design report at: http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/DTD/xmlspec-report.htm 
Neither of which exist ...

So you'd union them? 
There may be other spec formats we might want to throw into the mix too, then. 
E.g., OASIS may have a standard set of header info for specs submitted to them. 
Of course, a stylesheet can extract the relevant fields when it's time to publish. 
# "http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/DTD/xmlspec.dtd"

Yeah, I don't know what happened to these. 
Just use the URLs in my previous reply for now, and I'll work on this.

hi. i agree that it would be nice to have a common syntax for authoring w3c and ietf work products. 
a few things come to mind: 
first, you really ought to be talking to the rfc-editor@isi.edu, 
since they're the ones who manage the rfc editorial process. 
second, the rfc editorial "rules", which you can find in rfc 2222, have some, but not a lot of overlap with the goals listed in 
in particular, you don't get to do pdf, or html, and postscript when publishing an rfc. 
(well, they'll allow postscript for figures, but you'll get so much feedback that you'll prefer to chew off your right arm rather than actually publish anything in postscript...) this means that the translater is going to have to be very, very smart, or you'll need to allow dual markup for the same content. 
messy. 
there are about a dozen or so people who write I-Ds/RFCs using the 2629 format. 
there is one translator for it that produces .txt 
&amp; .html 
versions 
from it. 
however, ascii art is the lowest common denominator. 
the entire RFC 
database is available in biblio format for including as references (which is 
a major selling point). 
it's not really clear to me that a harmonization effort would work, given the limitations in rfc 2222. 
however, i could certainly imagine someone writing some XSLT that would translate from the 2629 format to whatever the new format becomes, presumably because the new format would be a functional superset. 
/mtr 
Yes. And if the various constituencies are interested and as this is the only public forum I'm aware of for this, I'd recommend it happen here. 
The question is can we attract attention from the IETF (Marshall?) and Oasis so we can work together?

Ok, done. 
I'm not following. 
RFC2222 [1] requires ASCII. 
[2] specifies an XML source format that could generate ASCII. 
RFC2629 specifies an XML source format that generates ASCII and HTML. 
So we don't have to go from source (xml) - 
output (pdf) - source (xml) - ascii ? 
[1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt 
[2] http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v21.htm [3] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2629.txt 
RFC 
is 
ASCII art is tricky. 
However, this bit only hassles those that need to present in both the IETF and W3C. 
One could have a graphic element type, and 
an alternative type, which might even be included as the Web Accessibility Initiative encourages this sort of thing. 
However, one day there might be neat SVG to ASCII art formats, AND you never 
know, IETF might permit HTML/XML one day. 
grin 
Do you have a public list set up for discussion of and maintaining 2629? 
If 
not, would you mind having those discussion in this forum? 
Dan Connolly, would this be acceptable to you as the guy that started this list?

Sure. 
My mind hasn't changed since I sent these... "Writing I-Ds and RFCs using XML" by M. T. Rose Dan Connolly (Wed, Feb 17 1999) Re: The scope of this list Dan Connolly (Wed, Mar 11 1998) Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
first, a correction: i've been writing "rfc 2222" and i meant to write "rfc 2223". 
oops! 
and 
this is what i wanted to get across: something that produces output for 2223 and other more expressive formats is going to have to allow for duality... 
never 
err, don't, uh, hold your breath... 
If 
there isn't a list, per se, people send me email and sometime it gets through [private joke to joseph]. 
we can certainly discuss it in this forum. 
guess i'd better subscribe!

Great! It's a very quiet list, but at least we can share our experiences and solutions, at best we'll create the spec super DTD.

I'm against creating large DTDs and would much prefer that we have smaller DTDs with more rigorous structure. 
Creating the "one- size-fits-all" DTD often ends up with a DTD that doesn't really fit anything, and people end up making subsets again. 
If we really can't transform from the current style of spec DTD to the IETF style of documents, then that says to me that they're so different that they should use different DTDs, i.e. they really are different classes of documents. 
Lauren 
In general, I agree; each DTD should stick to one "logical document type." 
But these are pretty close. 
We'll have to see how much the headers really differ, and if there's little overlap they may want to be developed separately. 
It would be nice to be able to hook them up to a common core, at least.
