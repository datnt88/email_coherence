<s> Nick, all of these are for you.  </s>
<s> Question (to Nick): Could you spend a little time explaining Figure 1 to us.  </s>
<s> It looks very similar to Solos but many will not know anything about Solos.  </s>
<s> If you could walk through the diagram I would be most grateful.  </s>
<s> Question (to Nick): What is meant by "the semantics of the Web Services" it req13?  </s>
<s> Question (to Nick): Would I be correct in assuming that for two to proceed they would have to be inside different choreographies?  </s>
<s> Why is only one Reaction allowed to proceed inside a specific choreography?  </s>
<s> See: When two or more Reactions are matched inside the same Choreography then only one Reaction is allowed to make progress by enabling its own actions.  </s>
<s> The selection of which Reaction is allowed to proceed is implementation specific.  </s>
<s> Question (to Nick): What does it mean to "Recover" a choreography?  </s>
<s> In particular how might it change the state of the web service participants and how might it change the state within the choreography itself?  </s>

<s> I apologize, I typically refrain to send pointer to articles on the list, but I could not resist that one.  </s>
<s> I think that I possibly found the best way to express what orchestration is: "[Orchestration] is an emerging [concept] that would give programmers a way to formally describe processes underlying business applications so that they can be exposed and linked to processes in other applications."  </s>
<s> Choreography can then be defined (I am sure someone can come with a better sentence), as: Choreography would give programmers a way to formally describe how processes from individual business applications are linked together regardless of specific boundaries (technical, organizational or legal).  </s>
