<s> Betreff: Features of WEBDAV Hallo,  </s>
<s> In your FAQ's on webdav.org  </s>
<s> I found the question "Which features are complete, etc".  </s>
<s> In your answer you write about "Versioning and Configuration Management" that this work "...is expected to be complete in late 2000".  </s>
<s> Now we have Feb 2002 and I cannot find any information about the state of development.  </s>
<s> Can you give me some information about the state of development of "Advanced Collections", "Versioning and Configuration Management" and "Access Control"?  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> Hi Philipp, Good questions -- it has been awhile since a status report has been made to the WebDAV WG.  </s>
<s> In brief: DeltaV specification: it has been approved by the IESG, and is awaiting publication as an RFC.  </s>
<s> I expect this to happen sometime in March -- I'm a bit surprised the RFC hasn't been issued yet, but it is rather long.  </s>
<s> Access control specification: it has passed a WG last call for comments, but several substantive pieces of feedback have been received since this time.  </s>
<s> There will be at least one more draft of the ACL specification, and at least one more WG last call, before it is sent along for approval by the IESG.  </s>
<s> This will probably be completed sometime in early summer 2002.  </s>
<s> Advanced collections work is currently on hold.  </s>
<s> After ACLs, the next major piece of work will be completing the DASL specification.  </s>
<s> DASL is looking like it will be finished in late 2002.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, - Jim  </s>
<s> Maybe :-) It would certainly help if there would be more feedback on the DASL mailing list [1].  </s>
<s> The current SEARCH draft has been updated a few minutes ago [2].  </s>
