I was wondering how to get JTidy to output malformed documents. 
I need to rewrite the urls in a document and have been using the process of parseDom() - manipulate DOM - pprint(dom) but this fails on many of the relevant documents. 
I am able to process the DOM so I would assume that the DOM tree is well formed though the document is not. 
The error messages I see mention that the document has errors preventing output. 
The output I get is a skeleton HTML document with no content (nothing in the body, bare header). 
Since this is preventing output not input, everything should be fine if I can turn off cleaning. 
Is this possible? 
Am I merely not setting the correct configuration options? 
Would it be reasonable to request a function uprint as a complement to pprint (ugly/pretty)?

I've discovered that the errors that I was encountering were not in JTidy thus I apologize for the fuss. 
However, I still am interested in outputting the document without cleaning it. 
Is this feasible?

Hi Neal, AFAIK, JTidy does not support the --force-output option. 
However, it should be quick work to patch JTidy to go ahead and emit the tree even if errors are encountered. 
I.e. just cut that test.
