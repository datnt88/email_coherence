<s> ~~ BUGS REPORT - HTMLTIDY WIN32 VERSION (AND MAYBE OTHER PORTS) ~~  </s>
<s> * EXPECTED RESULT: I want to take a Server-Side Include HTML file and tidy it up.  </s>
<s> The file only contains the information which would normally appear *inside* of but not including the BODY tag.  </s>
<s> As server-side includes work by embedding commands in HTML comments ( for instance !--#include virtual="/ssi/file.shtml" -- ) all comments should be preserved and in addition preserved as-is.  </s>
<s> * POSSIBLE BUG: The first SSI HTML comment either gets placed in the wrong location in the output or stripped altogether.  </s>
<s> The source HTML file follows: -- Start ---------------------------------------------- -- End ------------------------------------------------ *** BUG ONE *** Command: `tidydbg.exe  </s>
<s> file.shtml`  </s>
<s> Result: Notice how the SSI is placed in the wrong place at the TOP of the output (first line).  </s>
<s> It should be INSIDE the body tag!! Possibility: My guess is that htmltidy is viewing the first comment line in the file as if it is the doctype; however, this is incorrect behaviour in this case.  </s>
<s> -- Start ---------------------------------------------- 2002), see www.w3.org" -- End ------------------------------------------------ *** BUG TWO *** Command: `tidydbg.exe  </s>
<s> --show-body-only yes file.shtml`  </s>
<s> Result: Notice how the *first* SSI comment DISAPPEARS without a trace!  </s>
<s> Possibility: My guess is that htmltidy is viewing the first comment as a part of the HEAD and stripping it; however this is incorrect behaviour in this case.  </s>
<s> -- Start ---------------------------------------------- -- End ------------------------------------------------  </s>
<s> Unfortunately there is no way for tidy to tell which components of the page get included with You seem to include body elements and therefore expect the SSI in the body, however header.html  </s>
<s> could just as well include an XML declaration which needs to be included before the DOCTYPE.  </s>
<s> Simply put, tidy is reading a comment, which can appear anywhere, therefore adding it to the output tree, then it reads an h2 which requires a preceeding body tag so it generates the missing parts of the HTML tree, then adds the h2 tag in body context.  </s>
<s> See above, the comment is valid outside of the body and is placed outside of the body in the generated content tree, so it is not output when requesting body only.  </s>
<s> Not sure how to best resolve this, maybe results would more closely match expectations my attaching comments to the following elements (apart from implementation issues, can anyone think of a good reason why a comment should be attached to the following element?)

<s> So, we have someone who has HTML fragments that are to be treated  </s>
<s> as parts of a body , including all comments.  </s>
<s> Surely the simple thing is  </s>
<s> (echo " body "; cat TheFile; echo " /body ") | tidy to _tell_ Tidy that the contents of TheFile are supposed to be treated as part of a body?  </s>
<s> No changes to Tidy are required.  </s>
<s> So, we have someone who has HTML fragments that are to be treated as parts  </s>
<s> of a body , including all comments.  </s>
<s> I have a website with dozens of small files lying around - each containing  </s>
<s> fragments of valid HTML which get pulled together in real time by server-side include technology.  </s>
<s> As each file often gets messy over time through much editing, I wish to tidy them.  </s>
<s> I want Tidy to check the structure of and format them but without removing any content whatsoever.  </s>
<s> The command I am using is below however the first three comments get stripped.  </s>
<s> If I should be using another command, please advise.  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> `tidy --show-body-only yes document.txt`  </s>
<s> Here is an example of the typical document.txt  </s>
<s> file: In reality the file would have a lot more h? , p elements.  </s>
<s> I only want to tidy exactly what is below!  </s>
<s> !--#include virtual="/utilities/processes/ssi/header-utilities-process.html" -- p Schools are funded for the current financial year for an amount equal to the average of the previous two financial years expenditure as reported on the audited school financial return submitted each June.  </s>
<s> /p !--#include virtual="/utilities/processes/ssi/footer-utilities-process.html" --  </s>
<s> So, we have someone who has HTML fragments that are to be treated as parts  </s>
<s> Create a shell script like the one below (or a BAT/CMD file for Windows) that adds surrounds the HTML fragments with body /body tags, then run that script instead of tidy directly, i.e. mytidy.sh:  </s>
<s> #!/bin/sh (echo " body "; cat "$1"; echo " /body ") | tidy --show-body-only yes Command: mytidy.sh  </s>
<s> document.txt  </s>
<s> Alternatively change your include structure to place the main structural elements in each source file, i.e. Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net  </s>
