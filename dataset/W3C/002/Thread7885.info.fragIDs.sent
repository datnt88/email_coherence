<s> WebDAV Working Group Meeting (1:30pm Monday August 6th, 2001) IETF'51 London, England Lisa Dusseault standing in for Jim Whitehead as Chair.  </s>
<s> - Lisa D. presented the agenda and it was approved by the group.  </s>
<s> - Discussion started with DASL.  </s>
<s> Lisa D. is taking over the role of editor, and has tried to contact previous authors without much success.  </s>
<s> Lisa D. made a call for participants on the DASL spec.  </s>
<s> - Larry M. asked if the XML query language from W3C is sufficient for DASL.  </s>
<s> Lisa thinks it is solving a different problem and that an SQL-like syntax is more appropriate for DASL. - Should include discovery so that the server can answer which properties it supports searches over.  </s>
<s> Nobody stood up for schema discovery.  </s>
<s> - How about search over content?  </s>
<s> Should be in scope of the working group, but should it be a requirement of DASL? - IETF process ?  </s>
<s> should DASL be part of the WebDAV WG or be in a separate WG or be an independent submission?  </s>
<s> People agreed that it should not be part of the WebDAV WG. ACLs were in the WebDAV WG charter, DASL isn't.  </s>
<s> - Question: What remains to do in the WebDAV WG charter?  </s>
<s> Advanced collections, redirect references, properties registry doc., ordered collections, and raising DAV to a draft standard.  </s>
<s> - This remaining work is probably just lacking an editor/champion.  </s>
<s> The WG should push them forward or drop them if there is no interest in the work being done.  </s>
<s> - Larry M. presented the WebDAV Inter-op report.  </s>
<s> 58 people, 20 organizations, 35 implementations, (17 clients, 18 servers of which 5 open source).  </s>
<s> - Participants had agreed not to publish the results for individual tests.  </s>
<s> - Not many implementations inter-operated completely without any issues.  </s>
<s> - The event made good progress towards inter-op.,  </s>
<s> some teams made fixes in real time either on-site or in collaboration with development teams 'back home'.  </s>
<s> - Proposed a virtual inter-op meeting in late-September, say a four hour  </s>
<s> test window and a telephone conference call.  </s>
<s> - Mailing list for inter-op discussions is interop@webdav.org,  </s>
<s> which is by invitation.  </s>
<s> - Found common inter-op problems, maybe these can be distilled into an implementers' guide.  </s>
<s> - Little, if any, DeltaV testing took place.  </s>
<s> - Typical problems include security, URI encoding problems, etc. misunderstandings in the spec.  </s>
<s> - Inter-op testing uncovered some required features were missing.  </s>
<s> Many servers did not implement LOCK, and many clients required it.  </s>
<s> - Some inter-op problems were HTTP issues, such as authentication, multiple authentication headers.  </s>
<s> - Missing, unused, untested features included DAV:source property (nobody used or implemented it), content-language being reflected in the DAV:getcontentlanguage property.  </s>
<s> It was noted that the source property should be removed unless there are min.  </s>
<s> two independent interoperable client and server implementations of it.  </s>
<s> Jim A. pointed out that the DAV:source property is simply a dead property containing an HREF, there should be nothing difficult to implement it.  </s>
<s> Translate header was used in place of the source property by some implementations.  </s>
<s> It is a Boolean switch to tell the server whether to interpret the resource or not.  </s>
<s> - John S. asked if people had considered using simple URL mangling to indicate the source, such as in PHP's .phps - Poor support for the lang attribute on properties.  </s>
<s> Maybe it is not used because there is some ambiguity over it in the specification?  </s>
<s> - The "property behavior" element in MOVE/COPY may not have been tested.  </s>
<s> - Discovering the root of the repository.  </s>
<s> Some clients relied upon "OPTIONS /" to respond with DAV information, although servlet implementations would require at least a URL segment.  </s>
<s> So should clients not rely on "/" being in DAV-space?  </s>
<s> Clients may use other means of determining the root of the repository.  </s>
<s> One suggestion [from the floor] was to use the authentication realm.  </s>
<s> - Security issues included those who use authorization headers from one request with subsequent requests on the same connection.  </s>
<s> - Cookies in WebDAV.  </s>
<s> Some servers require that client support cookies, i.e. for session look-up rather than re-authentication.  </s>
<s> Clients should not be expected to support cookies, but in these circumstances clients should support cookies if they expect performant servers.  </s>
<s> This is material for the implementer's guide.  </s>
<s> - Lock-null resources.  </s>
<s> LOCK followed by PUT, and LOCK followed by MKCOL are both required to be supported according to the spec., but no clients required the LOCK followed by MKCOL behavior.  </s>
<s> Consider dropping this from the spec.  </s>
<s> - LOCK followed by UNLOCK should cause the lock-null resource to disappear.  </s>
<s> Varying implementations were seen.  </s>
<s> - Support for "If-None-Match: ?" is unknown.  </s>
<s> - Discussion of status code when creating a lock-null resource, should it be 200 or 201? - Maybe lock-null resources should have a discrete MIME-type to distinguish it as a special resource.  </s>
<s> However, some server platforms don't remember the MIME-types but rely on the file extensions.  </s>
<s> - Lock permissions.  </s>
<s> Lock operations by non-lock creator.  </s>
<s> Should there be a principal in ACLs that allows 'lock stealing'?  </s>
<s> Servers should only allow privileged UNLOCK.  </s>
<s> - If: header confusion.  </s>
<s> Issues surrounding the size of the header value when dealing with deep collections, and combination problems.  </s>
<s> When combining values does it mean logical AND or OR? Jim A. to post grammar for the If: header onto the list.  </s>
<s> - URL escaping ?  </s>
<s> how to deal with href illegal characters eg., "?/New Folder", are they XML escaped or URL escaped or both, and in what order, e.g. UTF-8 encoding and HEX encoding.  </s>
<s> Recommended to take a look at Donald's refs to DSIG document on canonicalization.  </s>
<s> - (At this point the curtain falls and nearly crushes Lisa)! - Where does the xml:lang attribute go?  </s>
<s> Does anyone care?  </s>
<s> Maybe should state that implementations should support it anywhere as XML generators may move it up to the root.  </s>
<s> No objections to putting the lang attribute on the DAV:prop element.  </s>
<s> - Servers should return URLs with a trailing slash when referring to collections, however, clients should not rely on it.  </s>
<s> Consider making the standing convention stronger?  </s>
<s> - Note that URLs returned in a multi-status may be relative to the content-location returned in the response ?  </s>
<s> should be in the implementer's guide.  </s>
<s> - Date format: page 27 of the RFC2518 stands.  </s>
<s> Implementations should follow the spec in this regard.  </s>
<s> - Lock owner information.  </s>
<s> Should servers take the information passed by the client, or use information they know based on the client's authenticated principal?  </s>
<s> Agreed that the server should take the information passed by the client, and maybe augment the lock token information with "creator" as well.  </s>
<s> - Should clarify which properties are live and which are protected.  </s>
<s> - Meeting closed at 5:30pm.  </s>
<s> From: Tim Ellison [mailto:Tim_Ellison@uk.ibm.com] - Question: What remains to do in the WebDAV WG charter?  </s>
<s> Advanced collections, redirect references, properties registry doc., ordered collections, and raising DAV to a draft standard.  </s>
<s> - This remaining work is probably just lacking an editor/champion.  </s>
<s> The WG should push them forward or drop them if there is no interest in the work being done.  </s>
<s> In the past, JimW has expressed interest in doing the final editing round on the advanced collection protocols (binding, redirect references, ordered collections).  </s>
<s> With the DeltaV protocol nearing completion, I would be willing to do the final editing round on the binding protocol.  </s>
<s> Anyone want to volunteer as editor for the redirect reference or ordered collection protocols, in case JimW does not have time to take care of this?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Hi, Ordered collections have been applied in a web server that generates an automatic menu in the browser screen (http://www.simplecms.de:8000).  </s>
<s> The question that came up in a discussion was how to expose that feature to webdav clients that are supposed to maintain the directory structure and content?  </s>
<s> Would it be appropriate to implement the draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-02?  </s>
<s> Are there known clients that could support this?  </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice.  </s>
