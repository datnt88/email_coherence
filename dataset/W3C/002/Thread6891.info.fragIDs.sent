<s> Regarding the xml:lang, I don't think it is a bug.  </s>
<s> I always thought that it would be a characteristic of the string (the literal value), and since M+S did not really address primitive data types, it wouldn't have to be concerned of xml:lang either.  </s>
<s> How do we propose adding it?  </s>
<s> As a qualification of the actual property value?  </s>

<s> - XML lang not being in the model was brought up by Sergey Thoiugh that suggests adding itto the model rather than removing it from th esyntax.  </s>
<s> Folks,xml:lang is not represented in the RDF model according to RDF M&amp;S 1.0, which is IMO a bug in the specs.  </s>
<s> - The issue of Alt, Bag and Seq being searated out from the basic model is brought up in example.  </s>
<s> - Issue: need for "poorest man" serializeion As a next step I'd like to have a "poorest man" RDF/XML serialization: rdf These may not be the first occurrences.  </s>
<s> But I think all the issued I pulled out I pulled out of previous messages.  </s>
<s> pointers to the first raising we can find would be a godo idea.  </s>
<s> As regards state, I think we can do a broader categorization.  </s>
<s> - Bug fix, propose for 1.1 (ml lang, some reference issues?) - Simplification (like removing PICS bits, aabouteachprefix, lang, etc).  </s>
<s> Doesn't affect other features = wait to see if IG wanst tto start an action to do them - Syntax change which can be done back-compatibly with existing syntax = suggest trials with software.  </s>
<s> Or something like that.  </s>
<s> Then we concldue, there are only 2 bugs and there is a consensus for a version 1.5, but we need to work on x and y at teh IG level.  </s>
<s> O  </s>
<s> If not a bug, a glitch.  </s>
<s> If you're saying that xml:lang values are similiar to datatypes, I agree.  </s>
<s> Some literal may have a type (eg.  </s>
<s> foo:floatPoint) and/or an xml:lang.  </s>
<s> This does clash with the model's insistence that literals can't have properties though... dan  </s>
<s> I think strings with lang specifications should be treated just like we should treat something like 5kg.  </s>
<s> i.e., 5kg=11lb just as Welcome(english)=Wilkommen(german).  </s>

<s> E.g. I'd like text to have a content-type so I could know that it was supposed to be application/xml or ... I'd also use this to handle units of measure in a nicer way; e.g. the literals ("1",inch) and ("1",USDollar) are distinct and have RDF-visible properties.  </s>
