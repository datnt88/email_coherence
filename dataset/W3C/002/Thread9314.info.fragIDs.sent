<s> The story so far: We have established that M&amp;S clearly states that it consider langauge to be 'part of' a literal.  </s>
<s> We identified 3 use cases requiring language support: Martyn's Jan's OCLC's Of these Martyn's did not consider representation of language in a literal to be important.  </s>
<s> The other two found the M&amp;S specification of language as part of a literal to be useful and adequate for their needs.  </s>
<s> I propose therefore that: o a literal be regarded as a pair (s,l) where s is a string of ISO10646 characters and l is either null or a language identifier as defined in RFC 1766 or its successors.  </s>
<s> o that an item be included in the errata for M&amp;S:  </s>
<s> which should make it clear that a literal is not just a simple string, but a compound structure including an optional representation of a language encoding.  </s>
<s> It should be noted that other parts of the text of the specification may need similar clarification.  </s>
<s> o that n-triple be modified to represent the language encoding of a literal  </s>
<s> o that we delay determining the wording of the errata and the change to n-triple until issue is resolved as the outcome of that issue may further refine the definition of a literal.  </s>

<s> Really? they found it useful?  </s>
<s> I thought the OCLC folks got their job done without using xml:lang.  </s>
<s> I guess I'll pore over the records, but I'd appreciate a pointer.  </s>
<s> That doesn't seem to cover the case of rdf:parsetype="Literal".  </s>
<s> Which text is wrong?  </s>
<s> it already says that a literal isn't just a string.  </s>
<s> Why? n-triples can repesent pairs already, using triples.  </s>
<s> I find that option much more appealing.  </s>
<s> I'm not interested  </s>
<s> in adopting it separately from a solution to rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure.  </s>

<s> in adopting it at all; but this issue allows me to give some justification, over and above 'yuk!')  </s>

<s> Eric, please did I understood you correctly at the last telecon?  </s>
<s> I understood you to say that the DC use case you provided did use xml:lang as specified in M&amp;S and that was adequate to meet the requirements of that use case.  </s>
<s> True - we've got that as a separate issue but really these should be considered together.  </s>
<s> or it can be a literal; i.e., a resource (specified by a URI) or a simple string or other primitive datatype defined by XML.  </s>
<s> This text does not make it clear, at least to me, that a literal can have a language component as described in: The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to associate a language with the property value.  </s>
<s> There is no specific data model representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the literal.  </s>
<s> The original WG have taken a different view.  </s>
<s> Is there a more powerful case that can be made to change what M&amp;S specifies than we have so far heard.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
