Folks, 
There is a terminology document at: 
Proposal: take this document and work it up to a glossary/appendix for 
M&amp;S. 
Are we within the charter to consider merging such a document into the 
M&amp;S? 
I think it would a useful thing to have. 
The last relevant post 
that I can find on this was from Graham ( http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0144.html ) Bill InterX bdehora@interx.com

I definitely think so, and it would certainly be a useful thing to have. 
We may also consider splitting it out into a separate document, usable for other RDF and RDF-related specifications. 
For an example, see the WAI Glossary, which tries to coordinate terms and definitions amongst them many WAI projects: [ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ 
] 
There is a currently active issue for this: #g

Hi Aaron, I'm glad you agree and it's interesting that you consider a separate document. 
I noodled for a bit about suggesting a separate document to 
cover M&amp;S and RDF schema. 
Maybe a mandated Semantic Web glossary (plus 
web axioms?) would be a good thing irregardless of what we decide to do here.

: There is a currently active issue for this: Hi Graham, I know, I raised it (can you tell what book I was reading at the time 
:). I'd like to force the issue though, on whether the M&amp;S should 
incorporate a terminology/glossary. 
I think it there should be such a 
thing if only because RDF is such a cross-disciplinary technology. 
I'd love to help work it up.

Bill DeHora asks: 
[terminology] 
As one of the self-appointed 'charter cops', I'll say that I don't believe it violates the spirit of the charter, so long as the terms it defines are restricted to those 
used in the M&amp;S and RDF Schema documents (modulo any 
new terms added in the course of clarifying those, such as using 'graph' to mean an instance of a 'model').

Morning chaps, M&amp;S already contains a glossary: I suggest that places it firmly in scope.
