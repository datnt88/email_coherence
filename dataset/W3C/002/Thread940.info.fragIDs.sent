<s> Hi, I lost my copy of Tidy when my computer was tampered with by children!!.  </s>
<s> I've tried to download another copy (Dublin mirror) but just get a strange file which I cannot 'read' tidy4aug00.tgz  </s>
<s> All links to download tidy lead back to the same web page sourceforge.net  </s>
<s> I would really appreciate another copy of Tidy as I found it very useful.  </s>
<s> Even if it is an older copy.  </s>
<s> Maureen Childs  </s>
<s> This is a tar-gzipped archive.  </s>
<s> I deduce that you're running on some flavour of Windows and therefore have nothing that handles a .tgz  </s>
<s> archive; but it wouldn't be any use to you anyway.  </s>
<s> If you go to http://tidy.sourceforge.net and scroll down, you'll find a section headed "other builds" - the first entry there is for a 27-Feb-2003 Windows version, in a zip archive.  </s>
<s> If you want the 4Aug00 version, you are welcome to download it from http://www.fred.bone.dial.pipex.com/Storage/tidy4aug00.zip if you can't find it anywhere else.  </s>
<s> You would, of course, be taking my word for it that this is an unmodified copy of the original.  </s>
<s> Either way, you'll need an unzip program (unless you're running Windows XP which I gather can do zip archives all by itself).  </s>
<s> If you don't have one, look for PKZIP, WinZip or PowerArchiver.  </s>
<s> Or, if you're reasonably computer literate, InfoZip's WiZ.  </s>

<s> I find this surprising : the Winzip I have on my windows station is able to handle tgz files.  </s>
<s> I would not really help, because the Unix code would not run.  </s>
<s> Jany  </s>
<s> Maybe so, but not everyone has WinZip (or PowerArchiver, or ...).  </s>
<s> Many people prefer WiZ, for example.  </s>
<s> HABit Tidy is a GUI wrapper for HTML Tidy for Windows I have now more-or-less completed HABTidy and would very much appreciate any comments and suggestions.  </s>
<s> I have done quite a bit of work on it since the initial release 3 weeks ago and it now has a comprehensive Help file.  </s>
<s> HABit Tidy was developed quite independently of Charles Reitzel's Tidy UI and although they share a number of features, they work completely differently.  </s>
<s> HABit Tidy is being made available as a "lighter-weight" alternative.  </s>
<s> Also, IMHO, it may be easier for the uninitiated to use.  </s>
<s> HABit Tidy is available for download from (230 Kb) Installation details are in the enclosed Readme file.  </s>
