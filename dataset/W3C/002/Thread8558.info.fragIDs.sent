<s> I'd like to suggest some mechanics.  </s>
<s> The WG meeting is Thursday afternoon.  </s>
<s> About the only time at the IETF meeting before that which does not conflict with sessions is Tuesday evening opposite the Social.  </s>
<s> I'll post a list of test cases which can be refined based on comment.  </s>
<s> Those participating can generate documents including signatures for  </s>
<s> these cases and exchange them (or send them to me for distribution to participants) via email or sneaker net no later than the Sunday  </s>
<s> evening reception.  </s>
<s> People are welcome to exchange information before then but Tuesday evening the participants get together to compare notes on verification efforts thus far, perhaps do a small bit of real time adjustment to implementations, and plan whether any further attempt to get together should be made before the Thursday afternoon WG meeting.  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>

<s> Hi all, At Baltimore we have some pre-release product we could bring to Interop if there are plenty of other implementations going.  </s>
<s> Can we get a hands-up of who will be attending with implementations?  </s>
<s> Also, will there be a standard DTD to perform interop against?  </s>
<s> Schemas aren't widely implemented in DOM world.  </s>
<s> We are just using the DTD out of the latest draft.  </s>
<s> (broken as it is compared  </s>
<s> to the schema) Is anyone doing validation against schems??  </s>
<s> We are supporting explictly namespace qualified elements in XML with no validation (although still based on DTD) or no namespace qualifications in XML with validation against said DTD.  </s>

<s> Some minor inconsistencies:  </s>
<s> 4.4.3 RetrievalMethod Schema has Encoding attribute on both RetrievalMethod and Type elements but DTD has Encoding attribute just on Type element.  </s>
<s> DTD correct?  </s>
<s> Then in the DTD on file, there is no Type element defined.  </s>
<s> The Schema has mandatory content for the Type element.  </s>
<s> This seems wrong because it can't then be implemented interoperably without further specification.  </s>
<s> 4.3.3.1 Transform  </s>
<s> In the schema, the "XPath" element is case-incorrect "Xpath".  </s>

<s> Something of that nature.  </s>
<s> RetrievalMethod simply seems underspecified given that it "SHOULD" be implemented.  </s>
<s> By making some of those parts optional, it could be read as minimally and sufficiently specified.  </s>
<s> For example, it seems reasonable to present a RetrievalMethod with the Location: ldap://ldap.baltimore.ie/CN=merlin?userCertificate;binary  </s>
<s> What, in this case, do I specify as the Method and Type, both of which are currently mandatory?  </s>
<s> By making Method and Type optional I can, at the very least, assume that the recipient will determine the type of key information from the URI.  </s>
<s> Merlin  </s>
<s> Thats the one, aside from Merlins comments.  </s>
<s> test  </s>
<s> Essential.  </s>
<s> I am in the process of embedding the DTD into another for signing - with that experience I'll put together another example (embedded/embedding) and post it.  </s>
<s> One comment I do have, is that XML-based applications requiring DTD validation find it convenient to embed the entire DTD in a DOCTYPE element in the XML directly - (rather than a reference) so that only the .xml  </s>
<s> file need be passed around.  </s>
<s> A restriction on doing this is that you can't have variable declarations a la in the DTD.  </s>
<s> For such an application, I have to take the DSIG DTD, search-replace all the variables, then embed it in the app DTD before embedding that in the xml.  </s>
<s> Do people think this is an acceptable process for that situation?  </s>
<s> I guess it has to be.  </s>
<s> Thanks, OWen Owen Roberts Toolkits Architect Baltimore Technologies, Dublin  </s>
<s> oroberts@baltimore.com  </s>
<s> Making some of this stuff optional seems reasonable but I would think that a lot of implementations would just pass off the uri to some retrieval mechanism without looking inside it and still want a separate indication of type and encoding.  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I just don't grasp the reason for the current structure of the element.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that a minimal specification would be [1]: RetrievalMethod Location="http://..." Type="foo#x509-certificate" Encoding="bar#base64" / A more pedantic specification would be [2]: Type could be expanded into an element, if desired.  </s>
<s> However, I can't see how Type would be more than a URI, nor do I see the impact of Encoding on Type, as captured in the current spec: As I say, I just don't fully understand what would be a default implementation of the current element specification.  </s>
<s> Merlin [1] [2]  </s>
<s> Interoperation is between signature creation software and signature verification software.  </s>
<s> Interoperation test cases are likely to use features defined in only a part of the DTD so I don't see that differences in other parts would have any effect, even for implementations that use an explicit DTD.  </s>

<s> Similar to http://www.w3.org/Signature/2000/05/30-interop.html , the idea is to have signatures fitting verious profiles generated by the participants and verified by other participants.  </s>

<s> Assuming that this is the DigestInfo type referenced in RFC 2437 section 9.2.1 (and it looks like it should be), Steve is correct that the inner sequence only covers the OID and the NULL, but not the OCTET STRING, and so its length is indeed 9 rather than 31.  </s>
