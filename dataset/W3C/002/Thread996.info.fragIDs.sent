<s> Hi Arjan, Have at it.  </s>
<s> Tidy uses the W3C license which pretty much let's you do what you want with many of the usual stipulations.  </s>
<s> For details, see tidy.c in the current sources or We all hope you get rich grin !  </s>

<s> Hello, I am trying out tidy in a commercial application.  </s>
<s> The results look very promising!  </s>
<s> I've browsed the tidy website http://tidy.sourceforge.net),  </s>
<s> but cannot find any licensing terms.  </s>
<s> Here's my question: May we redistribute the tidy executables (for different platforms: Linux, Win32 etc) with our (commercial) application?  </s>
<s> Or do we need out customers to download the executables themselves?  </s>
<s> Redistributing would make things a whole lot easier for out customers, but I need to be sure that that is legal to do.  </s>
<s> Any feedback would be appreciated!  </s>
