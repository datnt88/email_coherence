I've just noticed that we all had an action to mail Guha with information about features used by different implementations/applications. 
Jena and SiRPAC support reification in that both treat a Statement as a sub-class of resource. 
RDFFilter, the parser integrated into Jena does not generate the reification triples for Description elements. 
Neither does SiRPAC. 
I believe Dan Brickley and Libby Miller have worked on applications which make heavy use of reification, but I'm not sure of the status of those applications.

I'm not sure of the context but SiRPAC (W3C version) has a command line option (-bag) and the online service has a checkbox that causes the parser to do this part of the M&amp;S spec: The Description element itself represents an instance of a Bag resource. 
The members of this Bag are the resources corresponding to the reification of each of the statements in the Description.

Thanks Art, my mistake.
