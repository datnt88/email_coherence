<s> Jena and SiRPAC support reification in that both treat a Statement as a sub-class of resource.  </s>
<s> RDFFilter, the parser integrated into Jena does not generate the reification triples for Description elements.  </s>
<s> Neither does SiRPAC.  </s>
<s> I believe Dan Brickley and Libby Miller have worked on applications which make heavy use of reification, but I'm not sure of the status of those applications.  </s>

<s> The members of this Bag are the resources corresponding to the reification of each of the statements in the Description.  </s>
