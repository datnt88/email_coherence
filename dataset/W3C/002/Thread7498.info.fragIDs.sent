<s> I have a few questions about the intended semantics of URIs that are external members of collections.  </s>
<s> In particular, I am curious about those URIs for which the server named in the URI is not the same as the server that stores the collection.  </s>
<s> If server S has a collection C that contains an internal member P and an external member Q, when I do a PROPFIND on C I should expect to get back a multistatus that contains a results for both P and Q, right?  </s>
<s> And this is independent of the identity of the server in the URI for Q. Does this mean I can also do a PROPFIND on server S for the URI Q? and likewise a PROPPATCH?  </s>
<s> Surely this must be so, since it would be weird to be able to retrieve the property by asking the collection (with Depth non-zero), but not directly.  </s>
<s> And if I can do a PROPFIND (of a non-live property) I ought to be able to do a PROPPATCH.  </s>
<s> And if I can do a PROPPATCH, I should be able to do a LOCK and UNLOCK, too Now in that case, does WebDAV say anything about the semantics of a GET on Q?  </s>
<s> Is it silent?  </s>
<s> May a server return 404?  </s>
<s> (not found)?  </s>
<s> May it return 302 (Moved Temporarily)?  </s>
<s> Near as I can tell the spec is silent on these matters, and I wish it said something explicitly.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if URI Q is a member of two collections on S, it must be external to at least one of them.  </s>
<s> Does the spec say anything about whether the set of properties visible on Q MAY or MUST NOT in any way on which collection it is part of?  </s>
<s> Imagine, for example that two different users, A and B, each have a collection (Ca and Cb) stored on S, and they each add Q as an external member to their collections.  </s>
<s> If A sets a property on Q, will B see it, too?  </s>
<s> This might surprise B. I hope there are well defined obvious answers to these questions, that someone will tell me what they are, and that the next version of the documentation will include them.  </s>

<s> The purpose of the external member mechanism is to provide a place to record  </s>
<s> a set of URIs that are associated with a collection, that is it.  </s>
<s> Attempts  </s>
<s> were made in the past to give them additional semantics but after months of debate all these proposals were resoundly turned down as completely unworkable.  </s>
<s> Please refer the copious, nearly endless, discussions on the topic in the mailing archive for further details.  </s>
<s> You can also refer to previous versions of the DAV spec which contained various proposals to extend the functionality of external members beyond a simple storage mechanism.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> That's fine, very sensible decision, but could you or some other author answer the questions?  </s>
<s> I simply can't tell from reading the spec what the semantics *are*.  </s>
<s> The spec should be clear on the issues, otherwise people will simply guess, and likely guess inconsistently.  </s>
<s> If possible the spec should say clearly what happens, if the matter is server-specific or undefined, it should say that too.  </s>
<s> To restate them, briefly: 1) can I do a PROPFIND on an external URI? (*) Do the results depend in any way on the collection that contains the external URI? 2) can I do a PROPPATCH?  </s>
<s> 3) Can I do a LOCK? 4) What are the semantics of GET or PUT on an external URI.  </s>
<s> * by "do a PROPFIND" I mean if I do one, will I get back some useful values, not just a 404 error.  </s>
<s> Yours in confusion Jim  </s>
<s> I think I finally understand the source of your confusion.  </s>
<s> Does the existence in the next draft of an optionally read-only required property called externalmembers answer your questions?  </s>

<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I would say so.  </s>
<s> We have found it useful in our product thinking to see there as being a distinction between intrinsic document properties (last modified, content length, content type, etc.) and what we call "item properties" which it has by virtue of its relationship to a collection (a name, a position in the ordering, a bunch of other product-specific things).  </s>
<s> When you set a document property, then surely it doesn't matter which collection it is 'in' -- and for an external URI, surely it can exist 'in' no collection at all -- and therefore, yes, one rational position to take is that it changes everywhere.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, clearly item properties are collection-specific.  </s>
<s> However, we have also found that indeed it is disquieting to people to have someone changing a document property in their collection also changing it someone else's collection.  </s>
<s> In summary: I think it is possible to argue it both ways, and the spec should allow for either.  </s>
