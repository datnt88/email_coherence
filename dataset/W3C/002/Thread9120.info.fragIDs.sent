<s> Hi, In the xmldsig-core or RFC3275, X509SerialNumber is defined as "integer" As I know, serialNumber in a certificate is a ASN1 "INTEGER", which may be a very large value, such as "123456789012345678901234567890", which can not assigned to a general "int" or "long" variable.  </s>
<s> In XML Schema specification, I do not find the evidence that a "integer" value can hold BIG INTEGER like the above example.  </s>
<s> So I think the type of X509SerialNuber may be "base64Binary".  </s>
<s> Am I right or wrong?  </s>

<s> The xsd:integer class has no range limits, and therefore matches the ASN.1 Integer /r$  </s>
<s> Hi Andrew, Cited from [1]: 3.3.13  </s>
<s> integer [Definition:] integer is .derived.  </s>
<s> from decimal by fixing the value of .fractionDigits. to be 0. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the integer numbers.  </s>
<s> The .value space.  </s>
<s> of integer is the infinite set {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}.  </s>
<s> The .base type.  </s>
<s> of integer is decimal.  </s>
<s> I conclude from this definition that the schema type integer can be used to hold integers of arbitrary length.  </s>
