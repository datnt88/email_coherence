Hi 
I visited your website and found a similar topic bu I was unable to access the answer. 
Is there an example anywhere of the original HTML file and the new XML file?? 
I have a project to complete. 
Please help 
Thank you Marica Jones (jones@netdial.co.za) 
Just take any HTML file and run tidy -asxml file.html  newfile.html 
The new file will be XHTML (which follows the rules for XML documents).

If you use Tidy to convert HTML to XHTML then all the end tags will be inserted and enpty tags like br are convered to br / which is how empty tags are represented in XML. 
The space before the slash is put there by Tidy to avoid confusing old HTML browsers. 
Tidy also gives you control over the !doctype declaration. 
I recommend you download the latest version of Tidy from the Source Forge site, see the link on the Tidy page.

To be as specific as possible, see: Output XHTML DOCTYPE handling HTML Scraping (extract body contents) How To Set Config/Options Generally One thing to be aware of when converting to XHTML is that your in-line Javascript (or VBScript or what have you) may conflict with reserved XML characters. 
Browser script functions within script /script tags are CDATA escaped so that ampersands(&amp;) and less than/greater than signs ( , ) are passed to the scripting language unaltered. 
But it is not possible to do this for in-line event handlers (e.g. onclick="if ( a  b &amp;&amp; c  d) { a = d; }; return false;"). 
You will have to modify these handlers to make a simple function call and move the actual code to a script tag.
