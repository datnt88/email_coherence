<s> Hi Yaron, The group agreed to use a specific template for use case submissions [1], that includes information needed to derive requirements and demonstrate the choreography.  </s>
<s> Everyone who submits a use case should use this template.  </s>
<s> Otherwise your editors will go mad.  </s>
<s> Hopefully, you can find time before August to fill in the blanks, so to speak.  </s>
<s> If possible, I'd like to include your use case in the next publication, for which the submission date is 07012003.  </s>
<s> The template is not too onerous to complete, in general you should able to cut &amp; paste your existing text into the template, add any additional information requested, and put an end to it.  </s>
<s> Please help your editors, and also help to improve the end product of this group's efforts, but using this template for your use case submissions.  </s>
