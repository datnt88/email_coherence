hi, just a friendly reminder that I need the use case in the proper templete bu 07/01 Abbie 
use case submission deadline reminderI apologize for my general cluelessness but am I to re-write 
some new format? 
I probably won't have time to do that until at least August which I guess means that work was largely wasted. 
Sigh... that sucks.... what is the new format anyway?

Hi Yaron, The group agreed to use a specific template for use case submissions [1], that includes information needed to derive requirements and demonstrate the choreography. 
Everyone who submits a use case should use this template. 
Otherwise your editors will go mad. 
Hopefully, you can find time before August to fill in the blanks, so to speak. 
If possible, I'd like to include your use case in the next publication, for which the submission date is 07012003. 
The template is not too onerous to complete, in general you should able to cut &amp; paste your existing text into the template, add any additional information requested, and put an end to it. 
Please help your editors, and also help to improve the end product of this group's efforts, but using this template for your use case submissions. 
Regards, D- [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-ws-chor/2003Apr/0028.html

I apologize for my general cluelessness but am I to re-write in some new format?
