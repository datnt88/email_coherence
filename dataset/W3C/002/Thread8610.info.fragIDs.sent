* ACTION: Reagle, email poll of which option people want. 
* ACTION: Reagle, get Brian/Barb to tweak text once resolved.. 
Based on the summary of options provided by Merlin [1] it is presently clear 
that 2 OR 4 (everyone seems to agree supporting both is not good) are the 
preferred methods. 
My present tally is as follows: 2) B64 (C(P(ASN1(D(data))))) (PKCS#1 wrapped digest) a. Merlin Hugues b. Mark Bartel 4) B64 (OID . 
C(P(ASN1(D(data))))) a. Philip Hallam-Baker If you have an opinion on this matter (or need to correct the above tally), 
please make it known by close of business (eastern time) Monday.

The discussion on the teleconference indicated that those on the call were somewhat more inclined to B64 (C(P(ASN1(OID, D(data))))) except that you then had the digest algorithm specified both inside the RSA encipherment and in the algorithm name outside leading to additional complexities and error cases. 
So I think the consensus is for 2 which I also favor given the current structure.

It is my view, like Phill's, that there is no need to include the digest algorithm outside the actual signature value for original RSA signatures (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, or RFC 2313 compliant). 
It is also my view, however, that RSASSA-PSS signatures MUST have the digest algorithm included independently, because the MGF functions require knowledge of which hash algorithm is in use.
