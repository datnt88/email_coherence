If one "logical" document is split up into several html pages on (say) chapter boundaries, should each page be thought of as a complete html document (in particular starting with h1 ) or as part of the logical document so starting at section level h2 or h3 depending on the section level at which the document was "chunked"? 
I've normally preferred using h1 etc. 
The chapters and appendices of the MathML2 (and 1.01 and 1.0) follow this style. 
While testing production based on the xmlspec slices.xsl 
stylesheet I note that the generated sectioning level doesn't change when slicing is turned on, so chapters use h2-h5 rather than h1-h4 as previously. 
The W3C manual of style doesn't give any guidance on this question. 
It would be useful if the core xmlspec.xsl 
stylesheet could support this style, currently I have added the following to the mathml customistaion layer, which could replace all the templates in xmlspec.xsl for xsl:template match="div2/head" etc. 
It relies on a global parameter $slice.depth 
which is set to 1 if you are chunking on div1.

And while on the subject, wouldn't it be nice if we had a recursive div element so that sections could be more easily promoted or demoted?

A decent editing tool would do such promotion and demotion for you regardless of the DTD. 
One shouldn't have to corrupt the DTD to make up for the failing of the tools.

Hmm Not sure. 
I don't really mind either the "named section" style or the "nested div" style. 
However I don't really like mixing both in the same document. 
(docbook has both styles but I usually try to use just one or the other in any given document). 
I think it would be too big a change to throw out div2 and friends, so I'm not sure I'd want to add a nestable div. 
Meanwhile another featurelet in slices-common.xsl that I'm overriding in the mathml customisation... David !-- slices-common has which repeatedly produces the string value of an entire chapter, or the entire spec for every internal reference. 
saxon produces the mathml spec in a third of the time on my machine if this is changed to In addition add the test for "this slice" so references in chapter 3 to other parts of the same file are of the form #foo rather than chapter3.html#foo 
-- select="($target/ancestor-or-self::div1 |$target/ancestor-or-self::inform-div1 |$target/ancestor-or-self::spec)[last()]"/ xsl:if test="generate-id($slice) != generate-id((ancestor-or-self::div1 |ancestor-or-self::inform-div1 |ancestor-or-self::spec)[last()])" This message has been checked for all known viruses by Star Internet delivered through the MessageLabs Virus Scanning Service.
