<s> If one "logical" document is split up into several html pages on (say) chapter boundaries, should each page be thought of as a complete html document (in particular starting with h1 ) or as part of the logical document so starting at section level h2 or h3 depending on the section level at which the document was "chunked"?  </s>
<s> I've normally preferred using h1 etc.  </s>
<s> The chapters and appendices of the MathML2 (and 1.01 and 1.0) follow this style.  </s>
<s> While testing production based on the xmlspec slices.xsl  </s>
<s> stylesheet I note that the generated sectioning level doesn't change when slicing is turned on, so chapters use h2-h5 rather than h1-h4 as previously.  </s>
<s> The W3C manual of style doesn't give any guidance on this question.  </s>
<s> It would be useful if the core xmlspec.xsl  </s>
<s> stylesheet could support this style, currently I have added the following to the mathml customistaion layer, which could replace all the templates in xmlspec.xsl for xsl:template match="div2/head" etc.  </s>
<s> It relies on a global parameter $slice.depth  </s>
<s> which is set to 1 if you are chunking on div1.  </s>

<s> And while on the subject, wouldn't it be nice if we had a recursive div element so that sections could be more easily promoted or demoted?  </s>

<s> A decent editing tool would do such promotion and demotion for you regardless of the DTD.  </s>
<s> One shouldn't have to corrupt the DTD to make up for the failing of the tools.  </s>

<s> Hmm Not sure.  </s>
<s> I don't really mind either the "named section" style or the "nested div" style.  </s>
<s> However I don't really like mixing both in the same document.  </s>
<s> (docbook has both styles but I usually try to use just one or the other in any given document).  </s>
<s> I think it would be too big a change to throw out div2 and friends, so I'm not sure I'd want to add a nestable div.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile another featurelet in slices-common.xsl that I'm overriding in the mathml customisation... David !-- slices-common has which repeatedly produces the string value of an entire chapter, or the entire spec for every internal reference.  </s>
<s> saxon produces the mathml spec in a third of the time on my machine if this is changed to In addition add the test for "this slice" so references in chapter 3 to other parts of the same file are of the form #foo rather than chapter3.html#foo  </s>
