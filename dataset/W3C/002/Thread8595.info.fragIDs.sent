Element /h3 is used to convey a u reference /u to code KeyInfo /code information that is stored at u another /u location. 
For example, u several sigantures in a document might use a key verified by /u an X.509v3 certificate chain u appearing once in the document or remotely outside the document /u ; each u signature's code KeyInfo /code /u can reference this chain using a single code RetrievalMethod /code element instead of including the entire chain with a sequence of code X509Certificate /code elements. 
/p p u code RetrievalMethod /code uses the same syntax as code Reference /code except that there is no code DigestMethod /code or code DigestValue /code sub-element and presence of the code URI /code and code Type /code attributes is mandatory. 
The referenced data is a code KeyInfo /code sub-element type. 
The code Type /code attribute, as in Section 4.3.3, is a URI consisting of "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#" suffixed with a code KeyInfo /code sub-element type, such as "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#X509Data".

Hi, 
The DTD has an 'Encoding' attribute, it should be 'Type'. 
I presume that a request for a type allocation for a raw X.509 certificate would meet with resistance?

I'm trying to do an edit now and I'm running into this problem. 
It's not satisfactory to say, "URI consisting of "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#" suffixed with a KeyInfo sub-element type." 
We actually have to create URIs for all the KeyInfo types now, and what happens if someone wants to Retrieve something that we haven't defined? 
It's well known that I don't like these Reference and RetrievalMethod types, but given that it's required, it seems bogus to limit people to only our types and I don't want to define every type out there in our spec! Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org

Thanks for pointing out the error in the DTD. 
I don't have a problem with a raw X.509 certificate type... Thanks, Donald From: merlin merlin@baltimore.ie
