<s> Element /h3 is used to convey a u reference /u to code KeyInfo /code information that is stored at u another /u location.  </s>
<s> For example, u several sigantures in a document might use a key verified by /u an X.509v3 certificate chain u appearing once in the document or remotely outside the document /u ; each u signature's code KeyInfo /code /u can reference this chain using a single code RetrievalMethod /code element instead of including the entire chain with a sequence of code X509Certificate /code elements.  </s>
<s> /p p u code RetrievalMethod /code uses the same syntax as code Reference /code except that there is no code DigestMethod /code or code DigestValue /code sub-element and presence of the code URI /code and code Type /code attributes is mandatory.  </s>
<s> The referenced data is a code KeyInfo /code sub-element type.  </s>
<s> The code Type /code attribute, as in Section 4.3.3, is a URI consisting of "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#" suffixed with a code KeyInfo /code sub-element type, such as "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#X509Data".  </s>

<s> I'm trying to do an edit now and I'm running into this problem.  </s>
<s> It's not satisfactory to say, "URI consisting of "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#" suffixed with a KeyInfo sub-element type."  </s>
<s> We actually have to create URIs for all the KeyInfo types now, and what happens if someone wants to Retrieve something that we haven't defined?  </s>
<s> It's well known that I don't like these Reference and RetrievalMethod types, but given that it's required, it seems bogus to limit people to only our types and I don't want to define every type out there in our spec! Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org  </s>
