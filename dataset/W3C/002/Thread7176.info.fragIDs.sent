<s> I am writing to suggest that the tag: and urn:tag: schemes proposed in not necessary, being already subsumed in the existing urn:newsml scheme.  </s>
<s> urn:newsml has an unfortunately over-specific name, I admit from the beginning.  </s>
<s> But it has essentially the same structure as tag: and provides the same benefits.  </s>
<s> A newsml scheme URI looks like this: urn:newsml:whatever.com:20010911:anyoldstring:1  </s>
<s> This is, semantically speaking, a tag minted by whoever held "whatever.com"  </s>
<s> on 2001-09-11, and is named "anyoldstring".  </s>
<s> The 1 part is a positive integer representing a version number: this is not optional, but can always be set to 1 for people who don't need versioning.  </s>
<s> For those who do, it is guaranteed that it is monotonically increasing with time: any newly minted URI that agrees in its first five components with an existing URI must have a higher version number.  </s>
<s> The urn:newsml scheme is described in RFC 3085.  </s>
<s> All Gaul is divided into three parts: the part John Cowan that cooks with lard and goose fat, the part www.ccil.org/~cowan that cooks with olive oil, and the part that www.reutershealth.com  </s>
<s> cooks with butter.  </s>

<s> There is a lot of overlap.  </s>
<s> This should be pointed out in the tag FAQ or the draft.  </s>
<s> The biggest practical difference is that newsml requires minters to own a domain name.  </s>
<s> This may be reasonable for publishers of news articles, but it's an unnecessary restriction in general, so the tag specification also allows owners of e-mail addresses to mint tags.  </s>
<s> Semantically of course there's a problem that RFC 3085 says urn:newsml resources are "NewsItems".  </s>
<s> The idea is to name lots of things (cars, stars, bars, guitars, ...) with tags.  </s>
<s> Most software will never understand or care that these things are not NewsItems, but ontology systems (see [1]) certainly will.  </s>
<s> 3085 also says that urn:newsml URIs map 1-1 to their resources; this is not appropriate for many tag: applications.  </s>
<s> There is no way to stop people from naming things, in general, even if they already have names.  </s>
<s> Systems with unique names for things are nice, but impossible to construct in some situations.  </s>
<s> It seems to me, without really knowing anything about NewsML, like it wants to be using tags.  </s>
<s> I imagine the developers had to make a new URN NID to go with their markup language because they didn't know about tags, or because tags hadn't made it through the IETF process yet.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested to hear from a NewsML creator on this question.  </s>

<s> I was one of the editors of the NewsML NID RFC.  </s>
<s> It was one of the first approved NIDs, and I don't remember that "urn:tag:" or similar had been mentioned at the time.  </s>
<s> News generates a lot of item IDs, so it was not inappropriate to have a NewsML NID.  </s>
<s> However, I wouldn't recommend using it for anything other than news.  </s>
<s> I don't see that it hurts if there is a more generic NID that just happens to have a similar RFC.  </s>
<s> Just don't copy the mistake in the productions in the NewsML NID RFC.  </s>
