As my initial foray into non-toy XML Schemas, I took a stab at creating an XML Schema for the XML Specification doctype. 
My goal was to write an XML Schema that was configurable in the same general way that Maler/Andaloussi-methodology DTDs are, and that would validate the same set of documents (modulo additional constraints that DTDs can't express). 
I'm sure I've overlooked things, possibly large things, but the schema at now validates the XML 2e Recommendation with XSV 1.166/1.77 of 2000/09/28 15:54:50. 
Comments most welcome. 
Next stop...DocBook :-)

Greaat ... Hat off ! 
Humm actually which one, the .html are actually DTD valid XHTML and a possible candidates for Schemas validation too ! 
I'm wondering if merging the xlink.xsd in that directory and the one in http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2000/09/NOTE-xlink-naming would provide any gain ... 
Probably one order of magnitude more complex, right ;-) ?

What would really interesting he would be to hear about your experiences in learning and using the language, and your sense of the things that did or did not serve you well in doing this schema. 
Thanks. 
BTW: I have cross-posted as you have, but wouldn't this discussion belong on schema-comments? 
schema-dev is for developers of schema processors, I think.

No, this list is also for schema writers. 
The interaction between schema writers and developers of schema processors is quite important.
