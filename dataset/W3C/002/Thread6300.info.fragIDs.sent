<s> Umit, Thanks for the proposal.  </s>
<s> A few comments;  </s>
<s> * It seems like there's a lot of SOAP/WSDL/MTOM-specific language and rationale in this draft.  </s>
<s> Although I understand this work is motivated by Web services, it's critical that any mechanism like this gets the broadest possible adoption, so that Web services stacks can leverage this information in any XML it comes across, not just those that have been born (and will die) in a controlled SOAP message exchange.  </s>
<s> * Some rationale needs to be given as to why only media types, instead of content types, are addressed.  </s>
<s> * The document refers to problems with using URIs in the content of the mediaType attribute.  </s>
<s> What are they?  </s>
<s> * The acceptableMediaTypes attribute effectively defines a protocol.  </s>
<s> This seems very application-specific, hides a lot of information in ways that isn't accessible to XML tools, and reproduces a number of problems that are already evident in HTTP content negotiation.  </s>
<s> Why is  </s>
<s> it necessary to define this mechanism at all, when it's just as viable  </s>
<s> to use Schema to constrain what values are acceptable (for example)?  </s>
<s> * Section four appears to define a new type of Information Item.  </s>
<s> Is this really necessary?  </s>
<s> Indeed, why is this section necessary at all?  </s>
<s> Cheers,  </s>

<s> Hi Mark, I am glad that finally we are moving on.  </s>
<s> ;-) Thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> That is an interesting point.  </s>
<s> The note only addresses the declaration of the expected and actual media-type in the schema and since there is no established support for media types in the schema.  </s>
<s> The motivation, however, is definitely coming from Web Services angle, wouldn't you agree?  </s>
<s> We are jointly working towards publishing this note as WSD and XMLP wgs.  </s>
<s> Hence, I see that it is only natural that we indicate why we decided to do this and use our starting points as references.  </s>
<s> If you would like to suggest additional points to be added, would you please send them.  </s>
<s> I did not want to repeat the discussions that have occured in XMLP meetings.  </s>
<s> It appears that it would be useful to repeat the discussion in the document as well.  </s>
<s> I will do that.  </s>
<s> I am not sure I understand what you are proposing as an alternate approach.  </s>
<s> We simply have two problems at hand.  </s>
<s> (1) declaring the possible range of values that binary data may have (that is known) when schema is created.  </s>
<s> (image/*)  </s>
<s> (2) declaration of the actual media type that is specified by the document.  </s>
<s> (image/jpeg) For (1), we have discussed several ways of capturing this information in the WSDL wg, namely declaring the same information via Schema  </s>
<s> annotations , Schema notations, as well as replicating the possible range of values with additional types that mimic the media type hierarchy.  </s>
<s> After discussing the possibilities at our f2f meetings, an attribute indicating the range of possible values for a media-type appeared to be the simplest way of doing so [1].  </s>
<s> Note the current proposal is equivalent to using Schema Annotations.  </s>
<s> The attribute value could be  </s>
<s> also incorporated within an appinfo element and for all technical  </s>
<s> purposes, IMO, it is equivalent to the proposal we circulated.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that we should utilize Schema Annotations instead or are you suggesting another way of accomplishing the same thing?  </s>
<s> If you are suggesting that we constrain the range of values that are possible to declare an media type, lets discuss what the acceptable set should be to avoid the content negotiation problems that you are referring to.  </s>
<s> We were aware that this is rather a liberal set.  </s>
<s> This is to accomplish (2), namely the document needs to indicate the "actual" media-type of the binary data.  </s>
<s> Again, it is by using an additional attribute that the "binary" element would carry and indicate the media-type of the element in the document.  </s>
<s> I don't think that we can get away by not doing this, namely declare only (1) the range of expected media types but not say anything about the actual (concrete) media type in the document itself.  </s>
<s> The document is always required to indicate its "concrete" media type, otherwise media-type declared in (1) such as (*/*) would allow any content to appear and would not be very useful for interpreting the media type.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I would appreciate if you could clarify why you review this section to be redundant.  </s>
<s> If it is the spec language used that may be confusing, lets discuss.  </s>
<s> Thanks. --umit [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2003Sep/0218.html  </s>

<s> I think we need to achieve a careful balance here.  </s>
<s> It would be good to make the mechanism generic enough that non-Web services related XML technologies can leverage/utilize this if they chooses to do so.  </s>
<s> I think the proposal achieves that.  </s>
<s> It would be good to call that out.  </s>
<s> But I don't think we should go too far and say that this is *the* mechanism  </s>
<s> for representing media-types for all XML technologies (not sure if that  </s>
<s> is what you meant).  </s>
<s> I was going to send an email regarding this.  </s>
<s> I don't see why this should be restricted to media types only.  </s>
<s> I think we should allow content-types.  </s>
<s> The rationale for doing so is -- media types RFCs are allowed to specify mandatory parameters.  </s>
<s> Makes sense?  </s>
<s> Based on our discussion in Cannes, I'm not opposed to the outlined approach.  </s>
<s> However, I think we (WSDL and XMLP) should raise an issue with XML Schema regarding the ability to constrain an attribute in the manner we would have liked to.  </s>

<s> Mark, Are you suggesting that we ask that XML schema support attribute substitution group?  </s>
<s> Even if there were a attribute substitution group, that would still be a problem because one of the goals was to have a "standard" attribute in a namespace that would indicate the media type of base64Binary data in a doc instance.  </s>
<s> -Anish  </s>
<s> It's probably safest to ask Gudge to characterise exactly what we need  </s>
<s> All that I'm saying is that we had what seemed to be a reasonable requirement that Schema couldn't fulfil.  </s>
<s> We should give that information to the Schema WG as input to their process.  </s>
<s> Regards,  </s>
<s> Mark Nottingham Principal Technologist Office of the CTO BEA Systems  </s>
<s> LOL. I believe Gudge was talking about using substitution groups and concluded that one could not do that with attributes.  </s>
