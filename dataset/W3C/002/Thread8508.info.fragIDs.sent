<s> As we all know, we are presently using URNs for algorithm identifiers that are non-sensical -- they do not exist; they have not been registered.  </s>
<s> Assignment of a URN is a managed process.  </s>
<s> I.e., not all strings that conform to URN syntax are necessarily valid URNs.  </s>
<s> A URN is assigned according to the rules of a particular namespace (in terms of syntax, semantics, and process).  </s>
<s> [1] ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2611.txt  </s>
<s> Of course, we've needed some space fillers in our draft until we come up with something better.  </s>
<s> To that end (something better), I've been looking at the various policies of institutions and even have a potential syntactical solution that might help our situation.  </s>
<s> In referencing W3C specifications we are ok.  </s>
<s> While verbose, the W3C uses the dated name (URL) of a specification to reference the semantics of that specification.  </s>
<s> RFC2611 [1] specifies how to register/request a URN from IANA if we need to do so (though I prefer W3C namespace in the XML context) but we can't yet refer to other IETF semantics using URNs.  </s>
<s> The IETF URN Working Group charter [2] lists an Informational RFC proposal [3] regarding the allocation of IETF URNs to RFCs, but there is still no governing policy to my knowledge.  </s>

<s> And of course, this says nothing of other institutions like RSA, ISO, etc.  </s>
<s> When I was speaking with Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly about this issue we agreed that "making up" URNs defeats the purpose of URNs: ensuring integrity, persistence, and non-collission based institutional management of that namespace.  </s>
<s> The WG needs to use registered URNs, or create our own and then define which references apply to which tokens in that name space.  </s>
<s> Dan and Tim suggested something that I think interesting if I understand it properly.  </s>
<s> We might have attributes that look like: Or, we could try something along the lines of nesting xmlns:IETF="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core/IETF" and in the spec we define what signarure-core/IETF or /NIST means via a normative reference.  </s>
<s> What would really be nice is the ability to have qualified attribute values!  </s>
<s> Like: This feature is not in the present XML Schema WD [4].  </s>
<s> However, the Schema WG Chair tells me they expect to have this in the next or following draft.  </s>

<s> I don't know how the IESG will react, but I've been told that W3C will not look kindly upon bogus URNs.  </s>

<s> The IETF process only prohibits normative references to non normative IETF RFCs.  </s>
<s> It does not prohibit reference to normative W3C standards.  </s>
<s> The URN group was denied normative reference standing for good reasons unlikely to be resolved to the satisfaction of the IESG this millenia (14 months).  </s>
<s> Names arrive at their meaning through usage.  </s>
<s> The problem with the URN working group was that they pretty much ensured that their proposal would never achieve any usage.  </s>
<s> Lack of hierarchy never did much good for gopher URLs as I recall.  </s>
<s> I remain mystified at by the advantages of making the URN syntax incompatible with the URL syntax.  </s>
<s> If names are used for a purpose then they have meaning and it is inaccurate to describe them as 'bogus'.  </s>
<s> I note that Microsoft is already coding strings such as URN:schema-microsoft-com: into IE5.0.  </s>
<s> Whatever naming scheme anyone comes up with, there will be nothing to stop someone assigning an incompatible semantics to a name.  </s>
<s> The persistence of names is not a technical issue, it is a political and governmental issue.  </s>
<s> [Chances are that somewhere in the universe another planet has chosen or will chose an 8bit character set.  </s>
<s> Given this estimate the probability that our URN encoding will turn out to be unique, I doubt that the improbability is of cryptological proportions.]  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the IESG is pretty much inviting W3C to take the URN registration policy off their hands.  </s>
<s> If the URN legacy is too wedged we could always define a new class of URI, call it a URS (Uniform Resource Semiote), provide a means for any party to issue their own URS's using the IANA issued DNS infrastructure as registration keys.  </s>
<s> Then W3C can issue the needed character strings.  </s>
<s> If W3C can't manage such a process there is a pretty good chance nobody else will either.  </s>

<s> Note, I've moved part of the thread to the XML Signature WG, one other orthogonal question:  </s>
<s> So not only is it OK to declare CanonicalizationMethod/Algorithm as a URI, it's OK for SignatureMethod/Algorithm and DigestMethod/Algorithm as well.  </s>
<s> Is it possible to have a attribute declaration be of one or more types?  </s>
<s> (In an outdated section) the spec forbids: Constraint on Schemas: Attribute Locally Unique The same full name must not appear more than once in any archetypeSpec's attribute declaration set.  </s>
<s> but is there some other way to achieve:  </s>
<s> I've thought about (and John Boyer propsed yesterday) using Internal (General) Entities to alleviate the URI glut in the W3C's "first class object" paradigm.  </s>
<s> Bray actually gives this as a possible use: In URLs; many XML documents contain lots of URLs; as we all know, URLs tend to move around and are painfully difficult to maintain.  </s>
<s> It  is really useful to use entities to help make this easier: a href='&amp;home;/bin/wr.pl' .  </s>
<s> Consequently, I could have a signature that looks like: Signature xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core" SignedInfo !ENTITY c14n "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/xml-c14n" !ENTITY dsig "http://www.w3.org/1999/dsig-core" CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="&amp;c14n;"/ SignatureMethod Algorithm="&amp;dsig;/dsaWithSHA-1"/ ObjectReference Location="http://www.ietf.org"  </s>
