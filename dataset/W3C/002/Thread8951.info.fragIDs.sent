<s> I can't find the reference, but I remember being asked about the ability for attributes from external namespaces to be included within the Signature element types for extension purposes.  </s>
<s> For example: Historically, they're hasn't been much support (or a proposal even) for this functionality.  </s>
<s> If there was, I'd have great concerns about it because of the interpretation folks would lend to such attributes (as demonstrated in the example above).  </s>
<s> I prefer people make syntactic extensions through the Object element, and semantic extensions (what it means and what you are signing) via SignatureProperties and Transforms.  </s>

<s> Dear C14N implementors, how did you all solve the 'problem', that [1] (Section 2.1 Data Model) specifies:  </s>
<s> ... input need not be validated.  </s>
<s> However, the attribute value  </s>
<s> normalization and entity reference resolution MUST be performed in accordance with the behaviors of a validating XML processor."  </s>
<s> The test cases from the Canonical XML spec do not validate (like the spec allows).  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, ID attributes have to be identified etc. Did you implemented your own DTD handler?  </s>

<s> ... input need not be validated.  </s>
<s> However, the attribute value  </s>
<s> I think the issue here is not so much whether you are using a validating XML processor, but whether or not the XML processor reads external entities.  </s>
<s> Even non-validating processors are required to normalize attributes declared in the internal DTD subset.  </s>
<s> They may, but need not, do the same for attributes declared in the external subset.  </s>
<s> XML 1.0 [1] 5.1 states: Non-validating processors are required to check only the document entity, including the entire internal DTD subset, for well-formedness /.../ they must use the information in these declarations to normalize attribute values /.../ You may find that your XML processor allows you to disable validating but still process external entities.  </s>
<s> If not, try another parser!  </s>
