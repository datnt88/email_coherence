<s> Another question, this time about unsupported datatypes.  </s>

<s> Unrecognized datatypes should be  </s>

<s> The first half of the sentence would suggest to treat a literal of unknown type as just a string.  </s>

<s> Unknown or unrecognised datatypes are treated as being the lexical form (a string) of some unknown datatype.  </s>
<s> It is obviously the case that, whatever the datatype, identical lexical forms map to the same element of the value space, and can thus be considered equal.  </s>
<s> For non-identical lexical forms, however, it *cannot* be assumed that they do not map to the same element of the value space and are thus unequal.  </s>
<s> E.g., the lexical forms "1.0" and "01.00" would map to the same value (and thus be considered equal) in some datatypes (e.g., decimal), but not in others (e.g., string).  </s>

<s> Yes, I got that.  </s>
<s> But from a practical point of view of handling values from an unsupported datatype within a reasoning tool, this sounds like I can't even implement them as strings because since two different strings would be considered unequal.  </s>
<s> So the question is, how should I implement them?  </s>
<s> Consider the following: hasAValueOf rdf:datatype="someUnsupportedType" XYZ /hasAValueOf hasAValueOf rdf:datatype="someUnsupportedType" ABC /hasAValueOf by the definition, "XYZ" and "ABC" are neither equal nor unequal.  </s>
<s> So what should be the answer to the following question?  </s>
<s> Retrieve all instances of (complementOf(exists hasAValueOf XYZ)) Because we cannot *prove* that XYZ = or != to ABC, thus The answer would be empty.  </s>
<s> Am I correct?  </s>
<s> If I am correct, then this behaviour is the same as if XYZ and ABC are classes/instances.  </s>
<s> So really we can't implement values from unsupported datatypes as strings.  </s>
<s> Correct?  </s>
