<s> Hello, I hope this question is not too basic for this discussion group.  </s>
<s> I have read the DAV spec and browsed through the mail archive of this mail list but did not find an answer to the following question: Why has the lock-token to be universaly unique?  </s>
<s> Because it is a property that can be queried by any person, beeing in the state of posessing a universaly unique token does not provide me with a special privileges per se.  </s>
<s> If I understood the spec thats why you have to authenticate yourself to make use of a lock-token.  </s>
<s> But than, why use a token at all.  </s>
<s> Woulde'nt it suffice that the server registers who has taken a lock on the locked ressource (for example with the public key of the lock-owner) and require anybody who wants to perform "critical" operations on the locked ressource to verify his/her identity.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for helping me, regards  </s>

<s> See RFC 2518, section 7.6.  </s>
<s> It describes why lock tokens are needed to prevent overwrite behavior from two or more clients that are being run by the same authenticated user.  </s>

<s> Schlee, Section 7 of RFC2518 describes the locking semantics and provides motivation for both lock tokens, and why they need to be unique.  </s>
<s> Briefly, lock tokens need to be unique so that there is never a chance of applying a lock token to the wrong resource.  </s>
<s> The reason the principal id isn't sufficient is that the same principal may have multiple concurrent processes running at the same time.  </s>
<s> Lock tokens provide a way of managing concurrent updates for the same user in these situations.  </s>
