There is an alternate way to fix this by rule without introducing any variant properties. 
no, please see argument and correct with eg:age rdfd:datatype xsd:number .

There is an alternate way to fix this by rule without introducing any variant properties. 
The problem with owl:UniqueProperty exists regardless of the proposed closure rule. 
If you have both Jenny ex:age "10" . 
and Jenny ex:age _:x . 
_:x xsd:integer "10" . 
in the same graph, you will still get the conflict with ex:age a owl:UniqueProperty . 
since "10" will denote the literal and _:x will denote the datatype value. 
This is a fundamental incompatability with the coexistence of the inline and bnode based idioms and owl:UniqueProperty, 
and may even be construed as evidence of a problem with literals always denoting themselves... Patrick

Correct. Actually, the strict RDF+OWL conclusion here would be that 10="10", which presumably would be ruled out by the datatyping constraints. 
Well, lets not overstate the case. 
Obviously it is inconsistent to say both that a property is a UniqueProperty, and also that it has several distinct values for a given subject. 
However, I don't see that as being a 'fundamental incompatibility' or evidence of any kind of 'problem' (except maybe in the mind of whoever made those assertions.) Pat
