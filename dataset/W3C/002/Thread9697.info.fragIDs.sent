<s> since "10" will denote the literal and _:x will denote the datatype value.  </s>
<s> This is a fundamental incompatability with the coexistence of the inline and bnode based idioms and owl:UniqueProperty,  </s>

<s> There is an alternate way to fix this by rule without introducing any variant properties.  </s>
<s> Correct. Actually, the strict RDF+OWL conclusion here would be that 10="10", which presumably would be ruled out by the datatyping constraints.  </s>
<s> Well, lets not overstate the case.  </s>
<s> Obviously it is inconsistent to say both that a property is a UniqueProperty, and also that it has several distinct values for a given subject.  </s>
<s> However, I don't see that as being a 'fundamental incompatibility' or evidence of any kind of 'problem' (except maybe in the mind of whoever made those assertions.) Pat  </s>
