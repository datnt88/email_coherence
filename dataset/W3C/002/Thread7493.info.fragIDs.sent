<s> I've sent separate notes on issues related to the Collections Protocol that could not be resolved at Redmond.  </s>
<s> This note lists the proposed changes to the protocol that I believe had consensus among the group that was present.  </s>
<s> Unless I hear protests from the mailing list, I propose to make these changes: 1.  </s>
<s> The method for creating new references will be renamed to MKREF.  </s>
<s> The request-URI for this method will be the URI of the new reference to be created.  </s>
<s> The Referential-Member header will therefore be removed from the protocol.  </s>
<s> MKREF will behave like PUT: if a resource already exists at the request-URI, its content and headers will be overwritten.  </s>
<s> The issue of what happens to DAV properties breaks new ground.  </s>
<s> Live properties will get the properties the server deems appropriate, and dead properties will keep  </s>
<s> their original values.  </s>
<s> The protocol specification will state that MKREF MUST have Content-Length = 0, and the server MUST ignore any content sent with the request.  </s>
<s> 2. URIs in all headers will be changed to coded URIs. 3. All dependencies on the Mandatory Extensions draft will be removed.  </s>
<s> 4. The specification will be changed to say that servers MUST not follow references into collections.  </s>
<s> 5. The DAV:reftarget property stays the same on a COPY or MOVE unless the Ref-Target header is used to change it.  </s>
<s> 6. DAV:reftarget is a read-only property.  </s>
<s> It can only be set using the Ref-Target header on a MKREF, COPY, or MOVE request.  </s>
<s> 7. The specification will not include strong references for now.  </s>
<s> The Ref-Integrity header and DAV:refintegrity property will be defined, but the only value defined for them will be "weak".  </s>
<s> This will allow extension to support strong references later.  </s>
<s> The DAV:refsource property, which gets used only for strong references, will be removed.  </s>
<s> 8.  </s>
<s> There will be no DAV:ordering property defined by the protocol specification.  </s>
<s> Methods will be used to set the position of a collection member in the collection ordering.  </s>
<s> When a new member is added to a collection using MKREF, PUT, COPY, or MOVE, its position in the ordering can be set with the Position header.  </s>
<s> At later times, its position can be modified with MOVE and the Position header (It needs to be confirmed that this makes sense.  </s>
<s> If not, a new method will be added for modifying a member's position in the ordering).  </s>
<s> 9. DAV:orderingtype, which is currently an element of the DAV:ordering property, will become an independent property that can be directly accessed and set by clients.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> The current specification contains no explicit way to request that a collection be ordered.  </s>
<s> It was agreed that an Ordered header will be defined for use with MKCOL.  </s>
<s> Its value will be the DAV:orderingtype of the ordering.  </s>
<s> There will be one value of DAV:orderingtype defined in the specification, "Arbitrary."  </s>
<s> This is the default value if the header is not present, and means that the client cannot depend on repeatability of the ordering of results from PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> That is, on compliant servers, all collections MUST have a DAV:orderingtype property, whose value may be "Arbitrary" or any client-defined ordering type.  </s>
<s> A client may change the value of DAV:orderingtype after creating the collection, but is then responsible for updating the ordering.  </s>

<s> Be careful in stating this requirement.  </s>
<s> Either the MKREF method is not allowed to have a message-body (in which case Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding MUST NOT be given) or you want to preserve that as a future option (in which case the requirement should be that any message-body MAY be ignored).  </s>
<s> There should be no restriction on the value of Content-Length.  </s>
<s> This is something I fixed in the v11-rev-03 definition of OPTIONS, since specifying a specific value for Content-Length is both inadequate and overly specific for saying use of the message-body is not defined.  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I think the intent is that MKREF cannot have a message body.  </s>
