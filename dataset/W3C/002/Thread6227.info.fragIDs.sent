Here is a proposed plan for our switch to WSDL 2.0: 1- Editors to the necessary changes within the files (s/WSDL 1.2/WSDL 2.0/) until the group decide to publish them. 
2- Once the group decided to publish, I will copy the files in the directory 2002/ws/desc/wsdl20 _in the CVS database itself_. 
Editors are guaranteed to loose their changes on the old files in the meantime. 
I will change the name of the files as well. 
Copying the files in the CVS database will preserve the log history on them. 
The latest URIs of the document will become: As soon as I'm sure that I didn't mess up with the files, I will cvs remove the files in wsdl12, except for the files that are not related with the specifications (such as wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/*). 
It would be good to put the files that are not related part of the specifications in a separate directory. 
Feel free to create a new directory under 2002/ws/desc for other documents (task force documents, ...). 
3- As soon as I am done, I will send an email.
