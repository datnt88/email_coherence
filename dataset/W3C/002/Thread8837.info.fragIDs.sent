<s> Dear All, In the new interop test set, merlin-xmldsig-twenty-three, there is one test  </s>
<s> signature that troubles me a little.  </s>
<s> The one called signature-x509-crt-crl.xml implies signature validation processing that isn't really described by the specification.  </s>
<s> It's all well and good that the X509Data element can be used to transport a CRL.  </s>
<s> However, actually using the CRL should be part of certificate path validation, rather than signature validation per se.  </s>
<s> I mean, we might as well be testing whether DSig implementations can correctly parse an AuthorityInfoAccess extension in the certificate and execute an OCSP lookup based on the contents.  </s>
<s> So, IMHO, deciding to check a certificate against a CRL is application-specific  </s>
<s> functionality that shouldn't really be introduced into interop testing for the DSig spec in general.  </s>

<s> The reason for that example (in fact, all those X.509 examples) is that I was under the impression that this working group was required to demonstrate interoperability among all of our defined syntax, which includes X509CRL.  </s>
<s> I don't think that inclusion of a CRL is particularly useful; it is just part of our syntax.  </s>
<s> RFC 2026, 4.1.2  </s>
<s> Draft Standard (presuming that is our goal) The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable implementations applies to all of the options and features of the specification.  </s>
<s> In cases in which one or more options or features have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard level only if those options or features are removed.  </s>

<s> As far as I know, when signature validation is defined as an application it normally incorporates certificate path validation, as an optional feature if not a mandatory one.  </s>
<s> Since the principal reason to include a CRL in a signed document is to allow path validation without requiring the validator to go find revocation status, it doesn't seem that great a burden to exercise it.  </s>
<s> There is no definition in the specification of the processing of the X509CRL element, although in RFC 2459 one is expected to process a CRL or equivalent for every certificate in the chain.  </s>
<s> Minimally, for any X509CRL which matches one or more of the X509Certificate's in the same SignedData structure (the match is between the certificate's issuer field and the CRL's IssuerName field if the certificate does not have a DistributionPoint with a cRLIssuer field and between the CRL's IssuerName field and the DistributionPoint's cRLIssuer field if it does), you verify the signature of the CRL and then look for an entry with the certificate's serial number in revokedCertificates.  </s>
<s> The parenthetical matching rule above is basically similar to the current PKIX draft, but I've omitted the "indirectCRL" check when the cRLIssuer field is used.  </s>
