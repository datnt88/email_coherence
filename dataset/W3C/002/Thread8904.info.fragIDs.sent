<s> Hi I have a simple question: The DTD (or Schema if you like) says that there must be one and only one SignatureValue element.  </s>
<s> Is it a problem to say that there can be one or more SignatureValue ?  </s>
<s> Would it introduce anything else than flexibility?  </s>
<s> It surely would help me a lot, and (I think) make it more applicable.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, /Jesper  </s>
<s> I really don't see why having more than one SignatureValue inside a Signature does much more than cause confusion.  </s>
<s> You generally want different KeyInfo for each Signature anyway.  </s>
<s> I think the difficulty from your previous message, appended at the end of this, is the assumption that the data being signed need to be Objects inside as Signature.  </s>
<s> There is no reason you can't make something like Refs to Stuff&amp;Nonesense Refs to Stuff&amp;Nonesense Possibly a ref to user A Siganture Refs to Stuff&amp;Nonesense Possibly a ref to user A Siganture (Since you said A signs it and then hands it to B&amp;C, B&amp;C might want to also sign A's siganture.)  </s>
<s> The above leaves out the possible KeyInfo elements which might also be signed.  </s>
<s> While it is probably not worth it for just two elements like Stuff and Nonsense, if you were signing a bunch of things, you would probably create a References to each of the things in the bunch which could also be outside of any Signature element and just have one reference inside the Signature SignedInfo's to this Manifest.  </s>
