<s> Hi all - I am honored to join the WG as an invited expert.  </s>
<s> I am a visiting researcher in the Database Group at Stanford University and a Ph.D. candidate in Leipzig, Germany.  </s>
<s> I got into a liaison with RDF in the end of 1998 when I was working on my M.S. thesis.  </s>
<s> I was building a distributed XML-based system, and I found myself missing and reinventing many features essential for my application: a uniform way of identifying objects in XML documents, linking those objects, storing the relations between them in a database, etc. Besides, I was juggling tons of navigational code needed to traverse XML trees.  </s>
<s> At that time, RDF M&amp;S 1.0 was nearing completion and seemed a panacea for my needs.  </s>
<s> Thus, it became the data model for my application, and the liaison turned into a tight bond for years to come ;) One of my first experiences with RDF was writing a concise algebraic spec for RDF (which made it into my M.S. thesis) and working on an API for RDF.  </s>
<s> Nowadays, the API is often referred to as the "Stanford RDF API", but it was actually shaped as a community process on the RDF IG list, with me as the code maintainer.  </s>
<s> Starting with the code base of Janne's SiRPAC, the model and syntax aspects were separated, and the parser itself became a replaceable module.  </s>
<s> In the past couple of years my research was focused on interoperability between databases and digital libraries.  </s>
<s> In particular, I worked on mediation between Web services and on model management, which is an approach to storing data schemas and instances as first-class objects and manipulating them using high-level operators.  </s>
<s> For my research, I used RDF extensively for prototyping.  </s>
<s> My most recent industry experience includes helping a telecom startup Last Mile Services Inc. to build and deploy an RDF-based infrastructure for automated service provisioning.  </s>
<s> The goal of my work in the RDFCore WG is to help making RDF accessible and usable for the database community, and the Web community as a whole.  </s>
<s> In the recent years, the database community has contributed significantly to the development of formal models, tools, and products based on XML and targeted at Web databases and services.  </s>
<s> However, for many unfortunate reasons, researchers and developers were reluctant to adopt RDF.  </s>
<s> One of the non-technical aspects that I would like the group to clarify is the relationship between XML and RDF, and the potential (pragmatic, non-ideological) benefits of using RDF in realistic application scenarios.  </s>
<s> Speaking of XML, I am referring to the whole suite of emerged standards including XML linking, XML schema, query languages, and database-related efforts.  </s>
<s> Back to the spec, I would like to see RDF designed in a layered fashion with a clean and stable core, equipped with a flexible, well-understood extensibility path.  </s>
<s> I am looking forward to sharing the battlefield with you folks ;)  </s>

<s> To be frank, I am not really up to fighting - there are enough dead bodies (bugs, ambiguities, useless features) that we need to bury.  </s>
