<s> I suggest splitting the template rule for match="specref" into two, a template rule with match="specref" that calls a named template with a parameter, as shown below: (in the named template, all calls on key() are replaced by use of $target, otherwise the code is unchanged): !-- output a cross-reference to the element supplied in the $target parameter -- xsl:text Bad call to template output-specref: target contains I can then override the template rule for match="specref" while being able to reuse the rest of the logic.  </s>
