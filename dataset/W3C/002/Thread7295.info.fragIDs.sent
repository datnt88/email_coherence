<s> I am interested in the group's opinion on the Notify Request header proposal in Section 6. Do you think this is a good idea, or a bad idea?  </s>
<s> Server implementors -- how difficult would such a mechanism be to implement?  </s>
<s> 6. Notify Request Header (proposal, for comment) Whenever the NotifyRequest header is included in an HTTP request, the server should send update information on the progress of a request.  </s>
<s> Notify_Request = "NotifyRequest" ":" It is common, in asynchronous environments, to provide a mechanism to describe the status of a request as it is processed.  </s>
<s> As we provide for more and more powerful methods, which have longer and longer processing times, might we not want a similar feature for HTTP?  </s>
<s> Thanks! - Jim  </s>
<s> Now that I've read the draft, I have to confess that I don't understand what you intended to do with the Notify Request Header.  </s>
<s> Is this a way of the client asking "please send me 100 Continue messages as you're progressing?"  </s>
<s> Or did you intend for some other kind of progress report to be sent back?  </s>
<s> I see no value in a 'please notify me' request header.  </s>
<s> Clients will ignore 100 Continue messages if they aren't going to process them specially.  </s>
<s> And any client that is WILLING to process 100 Continue messages would always be asking for them.  </s>
<s> In general, I suggest that you avoid adding any features whose value you're not sure of, unless it solves a well known and widespread problem.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I suspect this is hair spliting but my understanding of "100 Continue" is that it is meant to be sent while a request message is being transmitted to indicate to the client that the request is being properly received.  </s>
<s> Further, I thought that if the request has completed transmission then all "100 Continue"s should be thrown out.  </s>
<s> I thought it was introduced because of chunking.  </s>
<s> What I am suggesting is that the server will send a continuous stream of update messages, which will be formatted as responses, informing the client of a request's progress.  </s>
<s> This would be used to create progress bars and the like.  </s>
<s> If we wanted I am sure "100 Continue" could be tasked to the purpose, we just need to make sure that each response contains enough context so the client can unambigously determine which request the response is in reference to.  </s>
<s> This sort of asynchronous notification solves a problem so fundamental it has been built into just about every OS known to humanity.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> I'm not questioning the need for asynchronous progress notification.  </s>
<s> I'm questioning the need for a request header to ask for it.  </s>
<s> A simpler approach would be to say that servers should always send back progress indications for long-running requests with whatever frequency they deem reasonable to implement, and that clients should accept progress indications and ignore them if they want.  </s>
<s> If 100 Continue isn't adequate for what you want (and I suppose it isn't), propose a different response.  </s>
<s> # This sort of asynchronous notification solves a problem so fundamental # it has been built into just about every OS known to humanity.  </s>
<s> While I know of lots of progress-reporting mechanisms, I don't know any that are built into operating systems, and I thought that most distributed systems wind up inventing their own.  </s>
<s> Many networking protocols don't contain any such mechanisms even when they're needed.  </s>
<s> What is the asynchronous notification mechanism built into any of: Multics, MS DOS, Unix, Tenex, the Alto OS, MacOS, Windows?  </s>
<s> I don't remember anything like this in ONC/SunRPC, Grapevine, XNS Courier, SMTP, HTTP.  </s>
<s> FTP has a progress header, but its application is limited.  </s>
<s> Unless you're thinking of something else?  </s>
<s> Could you explain what you mean by 'built into just about every OS known to humanity'?  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> 1. The problem with automatically sending update information is that it will break many clients.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.1 clients do not handle unsolicited responses very well.  </s>
<s> HTTP 1.0 clients would probably go insane.  </s>
<s> So we need a way for a client to indicate that they can handle unsolicited responses.  </s>
<s> Hence the header.  </s>
<s> 2. As for building into OS's, Sockets come to mine.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> Oh, so it's a versioning issue, not a client capability issue.  </s>
<s> That makes sense.  </s>
<s> Status might be signalled by a 102 Processing status code, probably with an entity body which contains the actual status.  </s>
<s> This would signal the client that the server is still working on the request and not to time out.  </s>
<s> We could add a new request header which indicates a client's willingness to accept such a status code, or else just bundle it in with HTTP/1.2 GET uri HTTP/1.2 would be the signal that '102 processing' responses are acceptable.  </s>
<s> Right? Larry  </s>
<s> Is there a HTTP 1.2 group?  </s>
<s> I thought the HTTP group's charter ran out with 1.1.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> # Is there a HTTP 1.2 group?  </s>
<s> I thought the HTTP group's charter ran out # with 1.1.  </s>
<s> The HTTP group's charter runs out when the HTTP group runs out of things which it agrees are worth doing.  </s>
<s> At one point that looked like it was going to be sooner (December) but now it looks like there are more things worth doing.  </s>
<s> But don't confuse IETF groups with work items: you don't need a working group to make, or extend, an IETF standard.  </s>
<s> The requirement is that you have a process that insures adequate review, and usually that process is 'form a working group'.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> Yes, that's one of the reasons why 1xx codes were re-introduced.  </s>
<s> Unnecessary.  </s>
<s> Any HTTP/1.1 client must treat all unrecognized 1xx responses as if they were 100 responses.  </s>
<s> Any client that doesn't is not using HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> The only thing you have to remind people of is that they can't send or forward any 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.  </s>
<s> .....Roy (and any implementer that screws-up on that part of the protocol is going to get a severe thrashing from me, since it is the key to status extensibility)  </s>
<s> Sending those headers involves overhead, a lot of overhead on slower links.  </s>
<s> We should have a means of indicating if we want a particular response stream.  </s>
<s> I know, I know, its not a proper use of a header.  </s>
<s> I agree and am open to suggestions.  </s>
<s> Where is the balance to be struck?  </s>

<s> Since there's a way that servers can send these kinds of responses when they see fit, and the servers are just as qualified as the clients to know when it's a good idea and when it's a waste of bandwidth, why don't we just put in the response notification and leave the request-for-response-notification behind.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Servers have absolutely no knowledge of what a client is up to.  </s>
<s> This is especially true when that client is sitting behind a proxy.  </s>
<s> The server sees a full Internet connection but on the other side of that connection is a modem.  </s>
<s> This is not acceptable from an implementation point of view.  </s>
<s> The result will be that proxies will kill these messages and clients who do wish to pay for the information will be left in the dark.  </s>
<s> Sometimes there are no clean solutions, Yaron  </s>
