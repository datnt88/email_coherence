Here, for discussion, are 5 specific recommendations I propose that MEP TF makes back to the WG. Anyone with other suggestions, please make them so that we can discuss them on Wednesday. 
Thanks! 
Proposed Recommendations from the MEP TF to the WSD WG 
1. Patterns describe *minimal* expected behavior. 
Each pattern represents a contract that specifies *minimal* behavior that is expected between the parties. 
The clients and services may have additional behaviors that are not specified by the pattern. 
Specifically, a client or service may send other messages (to each other or other parties) that are not described by the pattern. 
However, in such case, the parties must use other means to agree on the handling of the additional messages. 
For example, a message specified in a pattern as being from service S to client A might actually be broadcast to other clients in addition to being sent to client A. However, the pattern only governs the agreement to send the message to client A. 
2. Patterns specify parties as variables. 
Every pattern involving more than one message must specify (as variables) the sender and recipient of each message. 
For example, a pattern might specify: "Some client A sends a message M1 to some service S. Subsequently service S replies by sending a message M2 to client A." This example makes clear that S sends the response to A. As a contrasting example, a pattern might specify: "Some client A sends a message M1 to some service S. Subsequently service S replies by sending a message M2 to some client B." This later example makes clear that client A and client B are not necessarily the same client. 
(However, this pattern description also does not prevent a client from assuming roles of both A and B simultaneously.) 
3. In general, the WSD (and therefore the patterns) should only contain information that is relevant to more than one party. 
(For example, information that the client and service need to agree on.) 
4. Suggested pattern recommendations (under the "pattern specifies minimal behavior" assumption above, and ignoring faults, which are treated separately) p1 family recommendation: Adopt p1a: p2 family recommendation: Adopt p2e: Maybe also adopt p2d (Response to third party): *If* there is a standard way to indicate where the response should go, then p2d could be adopted instead of p2e. 
Note that p2d involves two clients, A and B, and from each of those client's point of view, it only sends or receives a single message, which could just as well be modeled by the patterns p1a (input only) and p5a (output only). 
p3 recommendation: Adopt as p2e, as described above. 
p4 family recommendation: Adopt p4c: p5 family recommendation: Adopt p5a: p6 family recommendation: Adopt p6b: p7 family recommendation: Adopt p7b: p8 family recommendation: Drop in favor of p6b, which can be used by the service as p8d under the "pattern specifies minimal behavior" assumption, without affecting the clients. 
5. Fault rules. 
Simplify to "message triggers fault", and further specify that the fault is sent to the client whose message triggered the fault. 
For example, in a pattern such as p2d that involves two clients A and B, if client A sends an initial request message that causes fault F to be generated, then fault F is sent to client A, not client B. David Booth

I don't agree at all. 
I do not think such a suggestion should be part of the task force recommendations, partly because I do not agree, and partly because what Umit has recommended, in a similar vein, is entirely different (she has proposed "message triggers fault" but with the message always going to the designated recipient, so the fault in the example above would go to B, not A). 
These slight differences are the kind of thing that make me really want to keep the ability to define different fault generation rulesets. 
I think that when people suggest winnowing them all out, it's because one set always works for their environment ... forgetting that other environments may have different requirements (where possibly one ruleset *also* works ... but it's a different ruleset).

Okay, additional responses.

I think that these two say the same thing; I think that three is a means of defining the slogan expressed in 1. 
I'm still not certain that I *agree*, but I do think that these belong together. 
Agreement. 
I think that this is a good-enough way to state the rules of participant identity. 
I want to think about the patterns. 
I'm not sure how comfortable I am recommending removals. 
Or, conversely, how comfortable I am leaving some of the oddities in if we recommend removals of others. 
Or, also, whether we ought to recommend more-than-one pattern for particular families.
