<s> Hi Jos,  </s>
<s> SiRPAC has a known bug with absolute URI's.  </s>
<s> I documented it as DEC-06-2000-1 at: Please take a look at the associated problem report: and test case: and let me know if the problem you see is different than the defect that is documented.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Art  </s>
<s> Art, That is fantastic!  </s>
<s> I really hope you will like that Leffe triple (one of the best Belgian beers, at least in my opinion).  </s>
<s> I've downloaded the 1.17 and it did the job.  </s>

<s> (at least I saw things like foo as predicate) Anyhow, have a very nice weekend!  </s>

<s> Hi Art,  </s>
<s> not sure I saw it happen with http://www.agfa.com/w3c/rdf/brian.rdf but that is of course a testcase (and I guess Brian would agree to put it at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/) BTW, I'm preparared to do regualar 'regression' tests with cwm, Jena and SiRPAC, because I think it is good that their N-triples results converge) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
