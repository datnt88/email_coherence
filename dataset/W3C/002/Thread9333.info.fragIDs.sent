I modified the W3C's online RDF sandbox (aka online SiRPAC): so that if the user selects the "list triples in N-Triples format" checkbox, the subsequent page will contain a list of the RDF's triples in the n-triples format (instead of a table of the triples). 
I also created a new release (1.17) of SiRPAC that includes the N-Triples support as well as some bug fixes that I've commited since the 1.16 release: To get n-triples output from the command line, do something like: % java -classpath SiRPAC-1.17.jar \ org.w3c.rdf.implementation.syntax.sirpac.SiRPAC 
\ -ntriples \ I've done a little testing and it seems to work OK. 
I've done no work with quote escaping in the object.

Could it be that some uris are not 'absoluteized'? 
(at least I saw things like foo as predicate) 
Hi Jos, 
SiRPAC has a known bug with absolute URI's. 
I documented it as DEC-06-2000-1 at: Please take a look at the associated problem report: and test case: and let me know if the problem you see is different than the defect that is documented. 
Thanks, Art 
Art, That is fantastic! 
I really hope you will like that Leffe triple (one of the best Belgian beers, at least in my opinion). 
I've downloaded the 1.17 and it did the job. 
Could it be that some uris are not 'absoluteized'? 
(at least I saw things like foo as predicate) Anyhow, have a very nice weekend!

Hi Art, 
not sure I saw it happen with http://www.agfa.com/w3c/rdf/brian.rdf but that is of course a testcase (and I guess Brian would agree to put it at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/) BTW, I'm preparared to do regualar 'regression' tests with cwm, Jena and SiRPAC, because I think it is good that their N-triples results converge) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/
