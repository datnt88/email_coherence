<s> I was just having a discussion of the draft spec with some people here, and a few interesting questions came up: How do lock tokens work when there are multiple lock owners?  </s>
<s> The client that actually requested the lock gets the token back in response, but how do the other owners get access to the token?  </s>
<s> If we use SiteMaps for containment, there is a lot less shareability than we are used to in manipulating, say, file system directories.  </s>
<s> Do we really want the proliferation of mime types that is likely to result if we start registering mime types for attributes?  </s>

<s> There are two different ways a system can deal with the multi-user token problem, both are supported by the spec.  </s>
<s> Each owner can independently request a lock and receive their lock token.  </s>
<s> If the access rights check then the multiple simultenaous locks will be granted against the multiple locks.  </s>
<s> Otherwise a single principal can request a lock for multiple principals.  </s>
<s> The multiple principals will then discover the lock token value by retrieving the lock attribute for a particular document.  </s>
<s> The single principal can also transmit the lock token out of band.  </s>
<s> As for SiteMaps, we are NOT using them for containment.  </s>
<s> We are using them to present information.  </s>
<s> As attributes are fully negotiable one can request any mime type one wants to get the info including a text file.  </s>
<s> As for proliferation of MIME types.  </s>
<s> Pick your poison.  </s>
<s> We can proliferate mime types or we can create one mime type text/attribute and put all of our attributes into it.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> It's better to pick a mime type for transmission of attributes and put all of the attributes in it.  </s>
<s> For some thoughts on what that format should be, here are some references (do a search on "Uniform Resource Characteristic*" in your favorite Internet search tool).  </s>
<s> Ron Daniel's history http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URC/  </s>
<s> Note that there were plans to (re)charter a URC working gorup in IETF, but they never got off the ground.  </s>

<s> We have an easy way to deal with dragons.  </s>
<s> Our standard allows developers to ignore them.  </s>
<s> With the exception of attributes which are used to implement a number of features, the entire standard is severable.  </s>
<s> So a developer can pick and choose what features they care to support.  </s>
<s> If any of our solutions do not meet their tastes they can feel free to not use them.  </s>

<s> Danger! Here Be Dragons!  </s>
<s> I don't get it, Yaron.  </s>
<s> If all of the attributes are optional and you can make more or ignore them all and do your own, then what's standard about them?  </s>
<s> If you want an 'optional standard attribute set' then use one that someone else spent more time on than we're likely to.  </s>
<s> You seem to be saying that we can ignore other people's requirements for metadata because they're free to ignore what we do, which doesn't make sense.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I suspect the next version of the draft will clear a lot of these problems up.  </s>
<s> However, in the more general sense, your arguments to date have been "Don't to this, it won't work."  </s>
<s> So we are going to do it anyway and if you are right we can always ignore the non-functioning parts.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> We do need to be cautious about saying NO to some dragons.  </s>
<s> Letting dangerous dragons to remain unanswered guarantees missing towns people.  </s>
