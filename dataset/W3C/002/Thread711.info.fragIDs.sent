<s> The solution which Adrian provided works.  </s>
<s> If you have a similar problem, try to set character encoding as RAW as follows: Tidy tidy = new Tidy(); tidy.setCharEncoding(Configuration.RAW);//This avoids JTidy mapping values  127 to entities This solves the problem of mapping bytes whose value is larger than 127 to entities.  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for Adrian's help.  </s>
<s> Jason Have you tried using the -raw option for character sets?  </s>
<s> (I've never used JTidy, but I assume it has this).  </s>
<s> It may help, but it's probably safer to transcode your document into UTF8 / UTF16 before tidying it, and then transcode it back into your character set.  </s>
