<s> Since no one answered yet, I'll repost Joseph's question with some background.  </s>
<s> Is this example, with the declaration , valid?  </s>
<s> In FSML, we have something similar to the disclaimer called signature restrictions.  </s>
<s> For example, a signing token, possibly qualified by a signer login and password, might be constrained to sign purchase orders but not checks.  </s>
<s> What FSML does (in DSIG terms) is add a Restrictions tag to SignedInfo .  </s>
<s> When the token receives the SignedInfo element for hashing and signing, it will reject the element if the Restrictions value does not match its internal rules.  </s>
<s> Similarly, we added a Sequence tag, with an incrementing number maintained by the token, for auditing.  </s>
<s> We were hoping that DSIG would similarly allow application dependent tags in SignedInfo , what I've heard called an "open content model".  </s>

<s> Could you give an XML snippet of this, showing the issue?  </s>
<s> Assuming that the following well formed XML instance reference and signature validates, is the following example a valid Signature?  </s>
<s> (It violates the specified content model).  </s>
<s> I'm slightly confusing the syntactical violation with a clear violation of semantics ("disclaimer") just to show why this might be important, but [x01-03] could be any name space qualified and wellformed XML.  </s>

<s> Hi Ken.  </s>
<s> I would argue that your stated use is syntactily invalid with respect to the content model as given by the DTD/schema (and I'm pushing that we be cognizant of this fact) and also semantically.  </s>
<s> (This is one reason why thinking in terms of a Data Model (via RDF) can be a good thing.  </s>
<s> [1]) SignedInfo is merely a collection of References with two properties: SignatureMethod and C14NMethod.  </s>
<s> Placing other semantics in there can be dangerous.  </s>
<s> The purposes that you speak of seem much more appropriate to SignatureProperties. (Have you considered this?) Syntax and semantics are not the same thing, but they obviously are closely related and in this instance we can use constraints on the syntax to also constrain the ability to make semantic assertions within our specified structures.  </s>
<s> Of course, one could place a similar corresponding statement in a Signature Property (invalid on Tuesdays) but that CLEARLY represents that this is a TRUST decision and has nothing to do with the signature structure nor its Signature Validity.  </s>

<s> We actually are considering using SignatureProperties as we try to fit FSML into DSIG.  </s>
<s> It's quite klunky because we designed FSML assuming a smart card would be doing the signing.  </s>
<s> By moving our Restrictions and Sequence tags out of SignedInfo , we now have to: - send two elements, SignedInfo and SignatureProperties to the card - hash SignatureProperties - insert that hash into SignedInfo - hash SignedInfo - sign that hash  </s>
<s> All of this has to be done atomically inside the card, or the security is easily compromised.  </s>
<s> It's not clear whether the extra processing can be done in a cheap smart card.  </s>
<s> Is there a good reason not to permit tags other then references in SignedInfo?  </s>
<s> I can see that it's elegant the way it is, but why is opening SignedInfo dangerous.  </s>
<s> In our application, if the smart card can't do the operation atomically, we will have to trust the host application, which is certainly dangerous.  </s>

<s> Hi Ken, this is a good report on your experience.  </s>
<s> This aspect is one of the earliest design principles: 2.2.  </s>
<s> XML-signatures are generated from a hash over the canonical form of a signature manifest.  </s>
<s> (In this document we use the term manifest to mean a collection of references to the objects being signed.  </s>
<s> The specifications may use the terms manifest, package or other terms differently from this document while still meeting this requirement.)  </s>
<s> This is a result of: 0. For all Signature applications, implementing the SignedInfo processing logic is very easy, there won't be any surprises.  </s>
<s> Taking advantage of SignatureProperties is more complex, but that's commensurate with its relative position to validating a simple signature.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The early data model [1] which attempted to associate the syntax with an assertion (digraph) based data model.  </s>
<s> Consequently, someone could run a RDF parser over our syntax and pick up the relations of these things.  </s>
<s> 2. We want to provide the ability not to include it in SignedInfo (it's own Digest or C14N Methods), consequently, supporting within and without is unecessarily redundant.  </s>
<s> (Instead of supporting "inline" signature, and all the others, the WG decided to choose the single method.) 3. It's proved useful in the rat-hole prone debate of Signature semantics.  </s>
<s> If you have something to say about the signature, that is external to our defintion of what a XML Signature is, place it outside of SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> While I appreciate your implementation concerns this is a core design principle that I don't think is likely to change at this point.  </s>
