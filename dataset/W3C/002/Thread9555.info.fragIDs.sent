<s> $Date: 2002/04/11 12:35:11 $ Hmm... on the one hand, I have been looking at each draft saying "well, it doesn't have the use case examples, and that's all I care about; I'll read the next one."  </s>
<s> But then I peeked into this one... and I mostly like what I see.  </s>
<s> For my money, it's good enough for 1st WD.  </s>
<s> If they editors (Stickler/Hayes/Melnick) are happy to publish it with their names on it, I'm happy to see it go out.  </s>

<s> this sounds like a union... and I don't see that as explained in and as I still think we should have rdfd:range rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:range .  </s>
<s> I would not recommend that.  </s>
<s> That would re-introduce all the range-inheritance problems assocaited with datatyping.  </s>
<s> The basic idea of the current proposal is to keep range-assignment (ie rdfs:Range) and datatyping (rdfd:Range) quite separate, so you can have either one without the other (or both if you choose to).  </s>
<s> That is the only way I can see to allow the kind of Dublin-Core sloppiness in a rational framework.  </s>

<s> Right. Though, not meaning to shake things up... ;-) Rules 2, 3, 5a, and 5b in the above have been removed in the latest draft and a new rule added (see below).  </s>
<s> Rule 3 above follows from the rdfs:range of rdfd:datatype defined in Rule 0, and thus is unnecessary.  </s>
<s> Rules 2, 5a and 5b have been removed.  </s>
<s> Both because they are unnecessary insofar as the datatyping interpretation is concerned and also because while all three idioms may all identify the same datatyped literal pairing, they do not have identical meaning.  </s>
<s> It is similar to the well known "morning star" versus "evening star" example, where both identify the same thing but do not really have identical meaning.  </s>
<s> One idiom thus does not imply another idiom as their total meaning will not be the same.  </s>
<s> The present rules, as defined in the current revision of the WD are: ### rules for RDFD entailment @prefix log: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log# .  </s>

<s> Oh, bad reasoning.  </s>
<s> We have an extensional language here, so we shouldnt be invoking intensional examples to block valid inferences.  </s>
<s> BUt since I can no longer see rules 5a/b, I don't know what the point was here :-)  </s>
<s> Not sure that is a good idea.  </s>
<s> I had this in an earlier version and took it out, for a technical reason that I can now no longer reconstruct exactly.  </s>
<s> I know it caused trouble, though.  </s>
<s> Its not strictly valid according to the current MT, in any case (since the semantic conditions on subProperty are not iff, just if), so I'd lean to omitting it.  </s>
