<s> It was a temporary fix while I was on the road.  </s>
<s> Attached is an updated single archive that is a replacement for -fifteen (simple signatures), -sixteen (complex signature) and -seventeen (various key info types).  </s>
<s> Now using http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/04/xml-stylesheet.b64.  </s>
<s> Now using http://example.org/XXX.  </s>
<s> Was trying for a new URI, but it got inlined.  </s>
<s> Removed; that was from a hand-built template.  </s>
<s> I've also reissued the certs with a longer validity, so the cert-based examples will be more accessible.  </s>
<s> It might be best to wait for someone to validate the signatures  </s>
<s> before relying on their usefulness, although things seemed to be  </s>

<s> Merlin, Thanks a lot for updated tests suite!  </s>
<s> It is very usefull!  </s>
<s> I successfully executed almost all tests but "signature-x509-is.xml" file.  </s>
<s> For validating signature in this file, I successfully located the certificate (from lugh.crt), extracted DSA key and successfully verified digest.  </s>
<s> But the signature verification failed and I could not understand "why?".  </s>
<s> If it is possible, can you send me the SignedInfo for this file just before you are doing signature, please?  </s>
<s> I hope that this will help me debug the problem.  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance, Aleksey Sanin  </s>
<s> And I also have one suggestion about signature.xml: the certificates chain in this XML file has Merlin's root certificate.  </s>
<s> From my point of view, in order to make it "trusted" it also should be available as a separate file.  </s>
<s> So I suggest to add this certificate to files in the certs/ folder.  </s>
<s> Aleksey Sanin  </s>
<s> Please, ignore this message.  </s>
<s> It was a "Friday bug" (turns out that all this time I looked at the wrong log file :) ) Aleksey.  </s>
<s> Joseph, Please update Interop table: XML Security Library (http://www.alelsey.com/xmlsec)  </s>
<s> successfully passed all tests from new Merlin's tests suite with one small tweak (root certificate extracted from signature.xml and also loaded separatelly to mark it as "trusted" as I described in previous message Thanks, Aleksey Sanin aleksey@aleksey.com  </s>
