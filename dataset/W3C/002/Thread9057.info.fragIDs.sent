Dear Merlin, You provided few interpretability tests for XMLDSig and XMLEnc working groups and some of XMLDSig examples have references to "http://xmldsig.pothole.com/xml-stylesheet.txt" page. 
However, this page is not accessible now: 
nslookup xmldsig.pothole.com 
** server can't find xmldsig.pothole.com.: NXDOMAIN If it is possible and if you still have a copy of this page, will you send it to me, please? 
I am trying to implement XMLDSig standard and your compiling with your tests suite is a good sign that my implementation is correct. 
Thank you in advance, Aleksey Sanin 
Merlin, thank you for the new examples but I had a couple of questions. 
I'm confused as to whether your update [1] is supposed to replace merlin-fifteen and merlin-sixteen in the interop matrix? 
(I think for new 
implementors, it's easier to download a working tar ball than one with some broken versions and updates.) 
Also, Don said he'd tried to restore xmldsig.pothole but I don't think he has, and I'm still willing to provide a necessary URI. 
As an aside, unless the post office has a address namespace, it's probably best to start the URI with example.org. 
Also, I wasn't sure what you were trying to do with [2], but I don't think it worked since the attachement didn't get a new URI? 
Finally, one of your examples uses "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#Reference" and that identifier does not exist (there's no definition, if we need such an identifier we should create one instead of abusing the 09/xmldsig namespace.)

Actually, example.org is better for examples than the US Post Office (usps.gov) .

Hi Joseph, r/reagle@w3.org/2002.04.02/16:57:15 
It was a temporary fix while I was on the road. 
Attached is an updated single archive that is a replacement for -fifteen (simple signatures), -sixteen (complex signature) and -seventeen (various key info types). 
Now using http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/04/xml-stylesheet.b64. 
Now using http://example.org/XXX. 
Was trying for a new URI, but it got inlined. 
Removed; that was from a hand-built template. 
I've also reissued the certs with a longer validity, so the cert-based examples will be more accessible. 
It might be best to wait for someone to validate the signatures 
before relying on their usefulness, although things seemed to be 
working last time around.

Thanks Merlin! 
I've updated the interop report [1]. 
Those that send a report against merlin-twenty three will get a "Y2" in their column instead of "Y1" (or in addition if they already exist).

Joseph, 
I have sucessfully validated the following signatures of merlins merlin-xmldsig-twenty-three.tar.gz with IAIK's implementation, except for validating the signature value of signature.xml, 
since it IAIK's implementation does not implement RetrievalMethod. 
signature.xml signature-enveloped-dsa.xml signature-enveloping-b64-dsa.xml signature-enveloping-dsa.xml signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1-40.xml signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1.xml signature-enveloping-rsa.xml signature-external-b64-dsa.xml signature-external-dsa.xml 
So please replace a "Y2" for all rows except the last one of section 1 (RetrievalMethod) and the sixth one of section 2 (minimal c14n). 
Regards, Gregor 
signatures before 
Ok, you and Merlin have an additional Y2 entry now.

Merlin, Thanks a lot for updated tests suite! 
It is very usefull! 
I successfully executed almost all tests but "signature-x509-is.xml" file. 
For validating signature in this file, I successfully located the certificate (from lugh.crt), extracted DSA key and successfully verified digest. 
But the signature verification failed and I could not understand "why?". 
If it is possible, can you send me the SignedInfo for this file just before you are doing signature, please? 
I hope that this will help me debug the problem. 
Thank you in advance, Aleksey Sanin 
And I also have one suggestion about signature.xml: the certificates chain in this XML file has Merlin's root certificate. 
From my point of view, in order to make it "trusted" it also should be available as a separate file. 
So I suggest to add this certificate to files in the certs/ folder. 
Aleksey Sanin 
Please, ignore this message. 
It was a "Friday bug" (turns out that all this time I looked at the wrong log file :) ) Aleksey. 
Joseph, Please update Interop table: XML Security Library (http://www.alelsey.com/xmlsec) 
successfully passed all tests from new Merlin's tests suite with one small tweak (root certificate extracted from signature.xml and also loaded separatelly to mark it as "trusted" as I described in previous message Thanks, Aleksey Sanin aleksey@aleksey.com
