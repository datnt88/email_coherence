<s> My proposal before we put it on hold was in the overly long: [1] An RDF Literal is a Unicode string, optionally paired with a language tag (as defined in RFC3066).  </s>
<s> in that thread we identified equally rules as follows:  </s>
<s> suggesting that such pairs are equal if and only if the unicode strings are equal and the lang tags are either both absent, or both present and equal (as lang tags, i.e. case insensitive).  </s>
<s> This then works orthogonally with: - the graph syntax - model theory - datatyping - any treatment of Unicode string normalization Jeremy  </s>
<s> In preparation for our discussion next week, I'd like to note some of the sub-issues.  </s>
<s> - In XML, xml:lang is inherited.  </s>
<s> This means that, in XML, there is a large number of ways to achieve the same set of associations between strings and languages.  </s>
<s> This may not matter in RDF as long as there is no more than one language per string.  </s>
<s> However ... - A string may contain sub-strings in different languages.  </s>
<s> RDF doesn't, IIRC, support a semantically neutral carrier equivalent to xhtml:span .  </s>
<s> Thus there is currently no way to represent multilingual strings in "first class" RDF.  </s>
<s> One reason for not associating arcs with string language is that one could very easily break any possibility of matching multilingual strings.  </s>
<s> - RFC 3066 defines exact and approximate matching (I don't recall the actual terminology) between language tags.  </s>
<s> For instance, "en-us" precisely matches "en-us" and approximately matches "en".  </s>
<s> - I don't think the proposal:  </s>
<s> is right, as a string without a language tag would not match one with.  </s>
<s> A consequence would be that people would be discouraged from language tagging their strings, in case other people haven't tagged *their* strings.  </s>
<s> - The above seems to suggest that degrees of fuzziness are required, at user option, as with regular search engines.  </s>
<s> - All of the above is closely related to other "control" constructs needed for correctly writing text in different languages, eg BiDi controls for BiDirectional languages.  </s>
<s> Though Math(s) is a language in quite a different sense, the same problem arises.  </s>
<s> Let's say the title of a paper contains something that can't be expressed in plain text, eg an integral from value A to value B. How do I do this in RDF and how will others match on it?  </s>

<s> [snipped]  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I don't think that's necessary.  </s>
<s> How about the following rules: Literals are equal iff: 1) the strings are equal, and 2a) at least one string does not have a tag, or 2b) one tag is a prefix of the other within the meaning of RFC 3066 (i.e. "fr"/French is not a prefix of "fry"/Frisian but is a prefix of "FR-CA"/Canadian French).  </s>
<s> This treats a missing tag as synonymous with the RFC 3066 language range  </s>
<s> "*", which matches any tag.  </s>

<s> At the plenary, in discussion with Misha and Martin, it became clear that there are two equalities needed.  </s>
<s> The RDF specs need a mathematically rigorous and transitive equality.  </s>
<s> User applications probably want an equality following John's proposal.  </s>
<s> The RDF specs need to clarify that application developers are not misled that the transitive equality is normative for all uses.  </s>
<s> The RDF Core has agreed that the definition of equality is as I earlier indicated, with exact (case insensitive) matching of lang-tags.  </s>
<s> Misha suggested that we should use a note to clarify this.  </s>
<s> Thus I propose that text such as the following is included near the definition of literal equality: NOTE: This definition of equality is appropriate when constructing an RDF graph, when checking an RDF test case, and when interpreting an RDF graph according to the RDF model theory.  </s>
<s> In other contexts it is usually more appropriate to use the methods described in RFC 3066 treating a missing language tag as "*".  </s>
<s> I was wondering where this might be put.  </s>
<s> The primer?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian-- This note doesn't strike me as the kind of thing that ought to go *only* in the Primer, although it might well go there in addition to someplace else.  </s>
<s> It sounds like an important qualification for RDF developers, and I don't think it should be *necessary* for people to read the Primer to get this type of information.  </s>
