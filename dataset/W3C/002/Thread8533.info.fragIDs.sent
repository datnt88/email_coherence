<s> I was unimpressed by the reaction at the IETF meeting to the need to omit  </s>
<s> Location and Transforms from the SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> Unimpressed because the  </s>
<s> opinions seemed to be based on fear, either of complicating matters or of creating security problems.  </s>
<s> I would prefer reasons grounded in fact rather than fears.  </s>
<s> At the meeting it was insisted that this standard be applied when deciding whether to reorder the elements in our signatures, and I would like to insist that we do the same here.  </s>
<s> The points recently made by Rich Himes and Daniel LaLiberte are absolutely correct and mirror my own thoughts on these issues.  </s>
<s> To sharpen the point, let's begin with this question: Suppose we have an XML signature in which the SignedInfo contained no ObjectReference descendants?  </s>
<s> What is the value of such a signature?  </s>
<s> Nil.  </s>
<s> The signing of SignedInfo is an intermediary step that *we* have added for some reason (perhaps the most compelling being that the method is quite clean about signing multiple objects with the same signature).  </s>
<s> The fact that the Location and Transforms are signed by *our* artificial process is a usually harmless and often desirable side effect.  </s>
<s> However, THE MESSAGE THAT THE SIGNER WANTS TO BE AUTHENTICATED BY A SIGNATURE IS THAT WHICH IS INDICATED BY OBJECTREFERENCE.  </s>
<s> Our process of signature generation creates a digest not only of the message intended by the signer, but some additional information, namely SignedInfo, whose subsequent invariance may harm the signer or prevent the use of core signature behavior.  </s>
<s> Signing SignedInfo is an imprecise method of achieving our actual goal, which is to achieve security by signing the DigestMethod and DigestValue of each ObjectReference (along with other bits of info outside of ObjectReference elements).  </s>
<s> No matter how loud the opposition sounds, the fact is that we have inserted an unintended and sometimes unwanted additional assertion in the message being signed by the signer.  </s>
<s> Specifically, we assert that the referenced object can be obtained by a particular sequence of steps (given by Location and Transforms).  </s>
<s> Further, this assertion is not eliminated by simply changing the name of Location to something like Target.  </s>
<s> It was acrimoniously asserted that the Location is required because the signer may want the signature to break if the data at the given location is changed.  </s>
<s> I disagree, and it should be obvious to the reader that 'required' and 'may' do not belong together in the same sentence.  </s>
<s> However, I do agree with the spirit of the acrimony, which is that the signer will often benefit from the inclusion of this assertion in the message being authenticated.  </s>
<s> Always including the Location and Transforms in the signature is unclean and borne of imprecision, but always omitting them is also problematic.  </s>
<s> One might be inclined to say that the signature should include an ObjectReference to a Location that must be invariant after signing.  </s>
<s> However, from a security standpoint, this solution has no bottom turtle.  </s>
<s> We could take the position that all assertions must be carried by the signed message and hence this problem of associating the signed data with its location and transforms should be pushed off to the application.  </s>
<s> Although, this is a more defendable position than the one taken by those who want to always include Location and Transforms in the signature, I do not agree with this either because we would be requiring an application to put assertions about *our* markup into its markup.  </s>
<s> In the end, it is best if there is *some* way to indicate whether or not the Location and Transforms of an ObjectReference should be included in the signature over SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> Obviously, this could also be accomplished by applying Transforms to SignedInfo that would omit Location and Transforms.  </s>
<s> Some have strong feelings that this will introduce the possibility of security holes.  </s>
<s> Of course it will.  </s>
<s> We have security holes that can result from the fact that we are signing markup rather than a bitmap of what the user actually sees.  </s>
<s> We have security holes that can result from poorly constructed transforms in ObjectReferences.  </s>
<s> As I presented at the IETF meeting, it would be easy for someone to write a transform that omits the DigestMethod and DigestValue descendants of SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> The Signedinfo Transforms element could even cause its own omission from the SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> It does not matter because we ultimately create a digest using a "secure" hash algorithm, and only the digested data can be used to assess the security of the signature.  </s>
<s> The point is that this is not a security hole in our spec but rather a security problem with the software that creates an insecure signature.  </s>
<s> It is not logically different from using the results of our specs with 256-bit RSA keys.  </s>
<s> People can do it with software based on our spec, but that doesn't mean it is secure.  </s>
<s> To some extent, signing SignedInfo is like a first implicit ObjectReference, which is why it makes sense to apply Transforms to it.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, if full-blown Transforms on SignedInfo are just too much for fear of complexity or security, then how about a simple 'OmitXXX' attribute in ObjectReference to specify whether or not the Location and Transforms should be omitted?  </s>
<s> It is not as flexible for the future, but it at least solves the problems we know about now.  </s>
