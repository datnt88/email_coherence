<s> (I specify it as "raw", to prevent Tidy from mangling Latin-2 characters in the files I process.) So, if I use cmdline arguments, I can suppress the declaration when I do e.g.: tidy --output-xml yes --add-xml-decl no --tidy-mark no $1   $1.xml but it stops working if I do: tidy --output-xml yes --add-xml-decl no --char-encoding raw $1   $1.xml To make things even more interesting, let me add that if I specify char-encoding as "ascii", it works as it should...  </s>

<s> Hi Piotr,  </s>
<s> First, I would recommend that you replace the entire XML declaration with sed.  </s>
<s> Yes, we might fix the bug (not respecting --xml-decl no w/ RAW encoding), but probably not in time to meet your needs.  </s>
<s> The format is highly regular and shouldn't be a problem w/ sed or awk in a shell script.  </s>
<s> You are fighting an uphill battle using RAW in the first place.  </s>
<s> The next  </s>
<s> major item on Tidy's agenda is to support pluggable character encodings a  </s>
<s> la Expat or LibXml.  </s>
<s> That said, have a look at the recent changes to support ISO-8859-15.  </s>
<s> It might be easier all around do a patch of your own to support 8859-2 along the same lines.  </s>
<s> Just thinking out loud here.  </s>
<s> Second, about the segfault, I found and fixed one in the new diagnostics  </s>
<s> code.  </s>
<s> If you are using a Compile Farm executable, it should be there tomorrow.  </s>
<s> If you are using Windows, I thought I it up after I fixed that problem, but let me know, and I'll make sure to put up a fresh build.  </s>
<s> If the problem remains, please send a sample config and input file.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> Thanks, Charles --  </s>
<s> Given this, I will perhaps begin by transcoding all the files into Unicode, as I guess this should eliminate both problems (the need for the "encoding" attribute in the XML declaration and the use of raw encoding).  </s>
<s> And if for some reason that won't work satisfactorily, I'll go for sed, as you say.  </s>
<s> I'm afraid I'm not up to this yet :-)  </s>
<s> I've already uploaded a test case with my bug report -- will see tomorrow how the new version fares against it (I'm using Linux).  </s>
<s> Thanks again :-) Piotr  </s>
<s> SF is currently down for maintenance, so in case this is something new, I'll file this report tomorrow: "HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 released on 1st January 2003" does not accept "char-encoding: utf8" in the config file -- all it did for me was output the XML declaration.  </s>
<s> The error file says only "Info: Document content looks like HTML proprietary No warnings or errors were found."  </s>
<s> in place of the ca. 12KB of warnings it would usually output for the kind of files I process.  </s>
<s> FWIW, the file I was trying to process was converted with iconv from Latin2 to UTF-8.  </s>
<s> When I remove the char-encoding option, the file is processed normally and converted to us-ascii, with the Unicode chars quoted.  </s>
