<s> I was about to send out the datatypes message to rdf interest, but I'm concerned that we have new information that means I need to change it.  </s>
<s> Have we agreed that test A does not hold for untidy literals?  </s>
<s> Patrick has, and I think Jeremy has.  </s>
<s> If so then I need to modify (simplify) the message - tests B and C can be dropped.  </s>
<s> The reasons we might decide that test A does not hold are: o it requires a special case in the reification machinery o it requires a special case in the container machinery o it interacts badly with rdfs:subPropertyOf  </s>
<s> I need some feedback from the WG on this.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Hmmm... I could live with one special case (for reification), but I'm less comfortable with two (for containers as well).  </s>
<s> I think it would be perfectly possible to have special semantics for these cases, but it starts to feel less reasonable.  </s>

<s> look less feasible in the absence of: a someProp "lit" .  </s>
<s> b anotherProp "lit" .  </s>
<s> a someProp _:x .  </s>
<s> b anotherProp _:x .  </s>
<s> But I do think this is a matter of taste, rather than a forced outcome.  </s>
<s> As for: I'm inclined to say "relax", but I'd be too tentative to be convincing.  </s>
<s> If we have: a someProp "lit" .  </s>

<s> I think it's pretty clear that: _:a dc:title "4th July" .  </s>

<s> dc:date rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:property .  </s>
<s> _:a dc:property _:l .  </s>
<s> _:b dc:property _:l .  </s>
<s> So the problem you raise is what happens when different datatypes are applied to dc:title and dc:date?  </s>
<s> If the datatypes have no literal- value mappings in common, then I think that simply means the graph is not satisfiable.  </s>
<s> I.e. there is no (DT-)interpretation that satisfies the antecedent so the entailment is trivially valid.  </s>
<s> (Datatyping, as currently discussed, applies only to a specific property and not necessarily to its superproperties.) #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Yup, but its beginning to give me the heebee jeebees.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> The logic survives, as best I can understand it, but is this the  </s>
<s> behaviour we want to specify?  </s>
<s> Would someone ever want to build a language on top of RDFS which had some notion of a TOP property.  </s>
<s> If they did, what would the implications for datatypes be?  </s>
<s> Are we willing to accept the constraint that all subProperties of a property must have the same datatype constraint?  </s>
<s> Or is there some magic in the model theory that can allow them not to?  </s>
<s> I need to find time to sit and think about this.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> It occurred to me that our discussion of datatypes and tidiness has a clear parallel with the Java language.  </s>
<s> Java has built-in datatypes (int, double etc.), whose instances do not have object identity.  </s>
<s> For each such datatype, there exist a "wrapper" class (Integer, Double, etc.), whose instances do have object identity.  </s>
<s> It seems what we are struggling with is whether we want RDF datatypes to be "int"s or "Integer"s.  </s>
<s> In fact, the stack-in-the-ground draft attempts to allow both ints and Integers to be used in such a way that one can be magically equivalent to another.  </s>
<s> The basic question about literals - tidy or untidy - can also be restated in a simplified form: do we want literals to have identity (be Strings) or not (be some kind of immutable char arrays).  </s>
<s> In RDF, the inline idiom corresponds to using ints, whereas bNodes can be seen as instances of Integer.  </s>
<s> In Java, ints and Integers are, of course, different things.  </s>
<s> I doubt that it is beneficial do glue these different concepts together in RDF.  </s>
<s> The motivation for using ints in Java is execution efficiency.  </s>
<s> The motivation for using the inline idiom in RDF is encoding efficiency.  </s>
<s> RDF is an information exchange language.  </s>
<s> I don't think that encoding efficiency is critical for RDF.  </s>
<s> There seem to be two paths from where we stand: (1) use XSD datatypes as ints.  </s>
<s> Extend the graph model to include the primitive datatypes in the graph syntax.  </s>
<s> Introduce "wrapper" datatypes as RDFDT classes if needed.  </s>
<s> (2) use XSD datatypes directly as Integers.  </s>
<s> Forget about ints and wrapper datatypes.  </s>
<s> Alternative (1) does not work if we have untidy literals.  </s>
<s> In this case, each literal has identity, including ints.  </s>
<s> Alternative (2) works both with tidy and untidy literals.  </s>
<s> As to tidiness, I'm confident that both tidy and untidy literals can be made to work and that the problems with reification and subproperties in the untidy case can be resolved.  </s>
<s> If RDF is based on tidy literals, applications that need untidiness can utilize bNodes.  </s>
<s> If RDF is based on untidy literals, equality for literals can somehow be hooked into applications where needed.  </s>
<s> In this case, however, even simple containment tests (e.g., is [Bob age "10"] contained in the graph?) would require some kind of basic reasoning, lookups of property definitions, support of RDF Schema and RDF Datatyping etc.  </s>
<s> This may be a too long stick to swallow for a desperate Perl hacker.  </s>
<s> Still, I would agree with Pat that untidy literals could of course appear in the subject position - they became identity, why not?  </s>
<s> Brian, if you are going to rephrase your message, the distinction between ints and Integers may be a helpful intuition.  </s>
<s> Sergey  </s>
<s> Er.. wait.  </s>
<s> In this case you could rationally apply one dtype constraint to dc:title and a different one to dc:date, and don't apply any dtype constraint to dc:property, so the above example would have any particular force.  </s>
<s> The current 'stake' proposal would only require that the literal fit into both lexical spaces, and I presume that would be OK if "4th July" is a well-formed DC date format.  </s>
<s> Not really, since (never mind datatypes for now) the whole point of subPropertyOf is that the subproperty implies the superproperty, ie if A ex:foo B .  </s>
<s> ex:foo rdfs:subPropertyOf ex:baz then A ex:baz B . and then add datatyping on ex:baz, and you get the equivalent of having it for ex:foo automatically.  </s>
<s> That is, the implication that is involved here isn't really to do with datatyping but to do with subPropertyOf.  </s>
<s> HOWEVER, the point is that datatypes inherit downwards, not upwards.  </s>
<s> In the above example, if you were to datatype dc:property, then both dc:title and dc:date would inherit that datatying constraint, in effect; but you could datatype them (differently, if you like) without dc:property being affected in any way.  </s>
