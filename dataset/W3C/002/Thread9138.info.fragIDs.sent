Like Aaron, I also didn't get a chance to make a presentation at the F2F (I left an hour before the end). 
My personal (and partly Profium's) RDF/metadata issues list was the following. 
I offer it only for the record: these are not necessarily the WG's concerns. 
1. Time dependence (this is my biggest concern about RDF and the Web in general: unlike Eric, I think 404s are a pain in the neck) Semantics of separated metadata: durability of semantic annotations: life cycle issues. 
Consistency of predicate semantics (current models tend to be time-independent). 
I think `coherence' is my main worry: coherence of related document sets in time, coherence of semantics over time 
2. Uniqueness, identity and identification Reliability of reference to external resource. 
Again a time-dependence/coherence issue 3. Language (the XML:Lang issue?) Our applications seem to be rooted in locale: so no issue but... Definitions of language dependence, tests of literal equivalence across languages, etc matter for long run. 
4. Non-RDF metadata (metadata derived from non-regulated sources) How to map into well-controlled RDF (equivalence between vocabularies, ontologies, etc) 5. Software design issues `Levels?' of RDF complexity (core, advanced, etc). 
Embedding of RDF in context (XML:Base, Xlink, etc). 
Archival forms of RDF (version, level, etc). 
6. 
The Semantic Web (in general) Will it be distributed or local? 
Will it be language neutral? 
Will it be conformable (abusable, open, uniform,...)? 
How will it be affected by time?

Martyn, There's been some interesting discussion of monotonicity in rdf-logic in the past 2-3 weeks, that I think may have some bearing on this point you raise.
