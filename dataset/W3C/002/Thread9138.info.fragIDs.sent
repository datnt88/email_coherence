<s> Like Aaron, I also didn't get a chance to make a presentation at the F2F (I left an hour before the end).  </s>
<s> My personal (and partly Profium's) RDF/metadata issues list was the following.  </s>
<s> I offer it only for the record: these are not necessarily the WG's concerns.  </s>
<s> 1. Time dependence (this is my biggest concern about RDF and the Web in general: unlike Eric, I think 404s are a pain in the neck) Semantics of separated metadata: durability of semantic annotations: life cycle issues.  </s>
<s> Consistency of predicate semantics (current models tend to be time-independent).  </s>
<s> I think `coherence' is my main worry: coherence of related document sets in time, coherence of semantics over time  </s>
<s> 2. Uniqueness, identity and identification Reliability of reference to external resource.  </s>
<s> Again a time-dependence/coherence issue 3. Language (the XML:Lang issue?) Our applications seem to be rooted in locale: so no issue but... Definitions of language dependence, tests of literal equivalence across languages, etc matter for long run.  </s>
<s> 4. Non-RDF metadata (metadata derived from non-regulated sources) How to map into well-controlled RDF (equivalence between vocabularies, ontologies, etc) 5. Software design issues `Levels?' of RDF complexity (core, advanced, etc).  </s>
<s> Embedding of RDF in context (XML:Base, Xlink, etc).  </s>
<s> Archival forms of RDF (version, level, etc).  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> The Semantic Web (in general) Will it be distributed or local?  </s>
<s> Will it be language neutral?  </s>
<s> Will it be conformable (abusable, open, uniform,...)?  </s>
<s> How will it be affected by time?  </s>

<s> Martyn, There's been some interesting discussion of monotonicity in rdf-logic in the past 2-3 weeks, that I think may have some bearing on this point you raise.  </s>
