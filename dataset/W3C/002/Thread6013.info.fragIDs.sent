<s> I enclose this to the mailing list for the completeness.  </s>
<s> It is essentially the same as the previous example I sent in many months ago (ref: Cheers Steve T  </s>
<s> This example is interesting, but it seems like a lot of machinery to describe what is essentially just connecting to something like a GetStockQuote service.  </s>
<s> What if you try to do something just a little harder, such as pulling (or pushing) the results of a StockQuote service through a CurrencyConverter service?  </s>
<s> Does the amount of pi-calculus machinery then become so cumbersome, in that case, that it starts to loose its intuitive appeal?  </s>
<s> Jeff  </s>
<s> Jeff, I agree with your comments.  </s>
<s> The reason for the use case and the reason for using the pi-calculus is that it is such a simple use case with no real business interest to it.  </s>
<s> The aim was to flush out fairly basic requirements by using an example that was easy to specify in an unambiguous way (hence the use of the pi-calculus).  </s>
<s> I don't think that anyone who is familiar with the pi-calculus would suggest using it as a one-to-one mapping to a language for choreography.  </s>
<s> Rather it has interesting properties that one can exploit.  </s>
<s> In the same way lambda calculus, upon which most imperative programming languages are based, is not evident.  </s>
<s> Syntactic sugar can be used to hide the formalism and help the intuitive appear and at the same time enable us to ask questions of a language with a formal base (even if not proven) that we perhaps could or would not otherwise be able to ask.  </s>

<s> I certainly found this to be the case when attempting to formalise work on a coordination language.  </s>
<s> There were a variety of issues, but mostly because pi-calculus is designed for describing the behaviour of a concurrent program and not the cooperative behaviour of autonomous distributed participants.  </s>
<s> As noted in my first post (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/2003Jul/0065.html) the solution was to develop a formalism reflecting the higher-level semantic concepts.  </s>
<s> I did consider building that formalism on top of the pi-calculus or other process algebra, but found other limitations as well (global state assumption, interleaved concurrency model, difficult to model locality).  </s>
