I thought it was pretty clear in rfc2518 (and rfc2518 bis) that WebDAV servers and clients are HTTP/1.1 servers and clients because the introduction section of the rfc starts off, "This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol that allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations." 
However, during interoperability testing I've found several servers which return HTTP/1.0 in the Status-Line of their response message and behave as HTTP/1.0 servers (i.e., they do not handle HTTP/1.1 persistent connections correctly, there are no Content-Length headers in a response with a message-body, etc.). 
For the most part, the Mac OS X WebDAV file system client works with these servers but it works much slower because of transaction aborts and retries. 
Should WebDAV clients refuse to use HTTP/1.0 servers and should WebDAV servers refuse to work with HTTP/1.0 clients? 
If yes, should rfc2518 bis make HTTP/1.1 (or later) a MUST?

Great question. 
I also would like to know if WebDAV works over https (SSL).

WebDAV works over SSL. 
It works, by definition, over anything 
that HTTP works over.

However, not all clients try to use SSL connections even if the server 
is using it. 
For example, Mac OS X's WebDAV file system client does not 
support SSL yet.

What about following clients? 
linux On win 95 and up netscape 6.0 + IE 5.0 + AOL 7.0 + On Mac Netscape 6.0 + IE 5.0 + Apple Sahara BTW: Great response time.

These are browsers, not WebDAV clients.

I agree that WebDAV server and clients should implement HTTP/1.1. 
So, servers implementing 1.1 are rewarded with better performance/user perception. 
Good. 
I think refusing to interop with a HTTP/1.0 server is not the intention of HTTP/1.1. 
Contrary, HTTP/1.1 was carefully designed to allow interoperability. 
Even if all servers support HTTP/1.1, there are a lot of poxies wich only support HTTP/1.0. 
SAP's implementation will therefore keep support for HTTP/1.0. 
I think it does already, maybe it should say so in a stronger way. 
But I doubt that it will have the consequences for your production code that you'd like to have.
