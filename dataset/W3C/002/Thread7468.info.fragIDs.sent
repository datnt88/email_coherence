Why does creationdate (13.1) mandate use of ISO8601 format instead of RFC 
1123 which is the prefered date/time format for HTTP 1.1, as stated in RFC 
2068, section 3.3.1 
Also, can someone provide an example of an ISO 8601 format? 
The RFC 1123 
example from HTTP 1.1 is "Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT". 
My apologies, the list's spam filter inadvertently caught this message. 
- Jim The ISO format provides a locale independent date time representation. 
While ISO 8601 specifies various ways to describe dates, times and combinations thereof, the AIIM DMA effort has utilized the following: DMA utilizes a locale-independent date/time format. 
DMA clients are expected to transform DMA date/time values into locale and platform specific representations as required for user presentation. 
A DmaDateTime is a specialization of a DmaString with the following syntax 
derived from ISO 8601: YYYYMMDDThhmmss[,f]Z where: YYYY represents a four-digit year number according to the Gregorian calendar MM represents a two-digit month in the range 01-12 DD represents a two-digit day in the range 01-31 hh represents a two-digit hour in the range 00-23 mm represents a two-digit minute in the range 00-59 ss represents a two-digit second in the range 00-59 f represents decimal fractions of a second to arbitrary precision The literal "T" separates the date and time components. 
The optional literal "," (comma) separates the time and fractional seconds components. 
The literal "Z" is mandatory and indicates that the time is represented in Coordinated Universal Time (also known as UTC or GMT). 
Midnight is represented by a time (hhmmss) of 000000 and indicates the start of the specified date. 
Applications desiring to store only dates using DateTime properties should specify a time component of midnight. 
Jim, 
The rationale for using the ISO8601 date format was a strong feeling on the Design Team (Yaron was the main proponent, as I recall) that it is a superior time format. 
Unfortunately, I don't recall any further details, though perhaps Yaron can shed some light on this.

RFC 
XML uses it and it is my understanding that all future IETF standards will be moving over to it. 
I believe Alex Hopmann knows more.

An example for ISO 8601 is 1997-08-15T11:12:00-0400 More information can be found, for example, at http://www.netspot.unisa.edu.au/html/compendium/datetime.htm . 
BTW, PEP (HTTP extension draft) mentions WebDAV in Section 17.1, "Client Queries Server for DAV" in the draft-ietf-http-pep-05.txt (expired 21 Nov 97). 
However, I could not find a link in the WebDAV drafts or on the web site to PEP. 
Is PEP obsolete? 
Yours, Markus. 
[ISO 8601 date format] 
There is also an internet draft on the ISO 8601 date format called draft-newman-datetime-01.txt , to expire in January 1997. 
Yours, Markus.

No, PEP is not obsolete. 
At the Washington, DC IETF meeting, a movement was started to create a new HTTP Extensions (EXTEND) working group, whose chair is Josh Cohen, and whose document editor will be Scott Lawrence. 
This working group is charged with further development of PEP, OPTIONS, and to creation of a draft which gives do's and don'ts for extending HTTP. 
The HTTP Extensions group has a mailing list. 
To subscribe, send a mail containing the following: Subject: subscribe The group also has a web page: The WebDAV specification does not reference PEP for two reasons. 
First, so far we haven't needed the capabilities PEP offers. 
Second, PEP is currently not a stable enough document to reference from within a proposed specification. 
However, I can and will put a link from the WebDAV web site to the HTTP Extensions working group.
