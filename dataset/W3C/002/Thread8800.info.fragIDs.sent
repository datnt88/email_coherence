<s> This attribute may be omitted from at most one Reference in any particular SignedInfo, or Manifest.  </s>
<s> What is the justification for the restriction embodied in the last sentence?  </s>
<s> Once you elide a single URI attribute from a Reference, you're guaranteed to be in an application-specific domain where the verifier must have out-of-band knowledge to match up Reference and referenced content.  </s>
<s> Given that the receiving application has to know how to find one referenced object, why can't it know implicitly how to  </s>

<s> Since we're talking  </s>

<s> Unless there's a compelling reason to keep the restriction (which I can't see), I suggest we remove it and delete the last sentence of the quoted paragraph from 4.3.3.1.  </s>

<s> Donald,  </s>
<s> I cannot see your point.  </s>
<s> It is no technical problem to design the call-  </s>
<s> back in a way to deal with the situation drafted by you.  </s>
<s> For instance the library could provide the position of the particular Reference within the sequence of Reference s, or instead of providing a null URI, the library could provide a proprietary URI indicating the posi- tion within the sequence of Reference s, such as "myProt:pos1".  </s>
<s> On the other side, I see no reason to allow an empty URI in a Reference at all, since you can solve all those scenarios with proprietary URIs.  </s>
<s> But that are all minor issues.  </s>
<s> The most important point I think is that the specification reaches Recommendation status asap.  </s>
<s> If changing anything here leads to further delays, I am strongly opposed to such changes.  </s>

<s> Hi, In trying to explain the logic behind the original design decision, I left out the most important reason to leave it alone, that it is not worth making such a change at this late date.  </s>
<s> Basicly, XML is verbose, so the logic of trying to save a few characters is always open to question.  </s>
<s> The things the spec lets you leave out are at most one Reference URI and the KeyInfo element.  </s>
<s> It could have also permitted omission of CanonicalizationMethod, SignatureMethod, DigestMethod, and maybe a few other things, but did not.  </s>
<s> KeyInfo omission is, in my opinion, motivated by its possible huge size as well as other factors mentioned in the spec.  </s>
<s> (KeyInfo is also different in not being secured unless you add a Reference to it...) Omitting at most one URI was allowed, I believe, because it does not break the model that a Refence can be processed in isolation without taking into account anything else about the SignedInfo (or Manifest) in which it appears.  </s>
<s> Thus, in some way, an absent URI is just a particular kind of unique pointer to the verifying application.  </s>
<s> This model is broken if multiple URIs can be elided, resulting in added complexity.  </s>

<s> I have no idea what your image of the modularization is or what is doing this filtering, but it seems to me you'd be pretty safe using schemes that start with "x-", such as "x-1:", "x-2:", if you want or "microsoft.com:1", etc.  </s>
<s> Use of a different namesapce than the XMLDSIG one would also be a clear signal that interpretation of the whole Signature is application specific.  </s>
<s> So it's not like you can't escape to a different world if you want.  </s>
<s> There are many ways an applications could formulate URIs so that it would be trivial for a URI dereferencing module to recognize them.  </s>
<s> I've given two above.  </s>
<s> Please point out where I said anything about this was "evil".  </s>
<s> As I tried to explain below, it changes the modulariztion coupling and a minor design principle and, I believe, changes them for the worse.  </s>
<s> If multiple Reference URIs can be elided, then the Reference no longer identifies its data.  </s>
<s> Think what you will of this point I really don't see any clearer way of explaining it than I have above and below.  </s>
