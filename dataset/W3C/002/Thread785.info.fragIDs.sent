Hi there, A month ago or two I lost my copy of the latest version (August 2000). 
Since then I've tried to download a new one nearly almost everyday, but I only get the version from April 2000. 
Since I'm a member of the mailinglist I've read that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem and that the problem will be solved. 
But I feel crippled without the August-version (I'm a Tidy-addict). 
Can anyone help me by sending me a copy or do I have to wait until the new version is available?

Download the "tidy4aug00.zip" 
file listed under "Source Code". 
Despite what it says, the zip file does actually contain the 4Aug *executable*.

...in *addition* to the source code, that is.
