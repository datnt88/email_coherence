God help us, but there now seem to be two URI lists. 
This seems not only redundent but potentially destructive. 
The W3C seems exactly the right place for these discussions to be carried forward and archived. 
Could we agree to annoint that list as The Place 
(tm), or is there actually reason to divide the topic space?

Where the mailing list is run doesn't matter at all for the IESG. 
So, it is neither better, nor worse to run it at W3C. Regarding two lists, you might mix up the URN-discussions list and the URI discussion list. 
Both lists were hosted at Bunyip, but thy are still different. 
They are both belonging (or was regarding the URI mailing list) to IETF working groups.

I guess what I am suggesting is that URN-IETF and URI@w3.orf have overlapping objectives and, judging from the traffic, could be conflated. 
And yes, I agree with the other sentiments expressed... need for open discussion, etc.

We are certainly interested in discussing issues of persistence on the uri@w3.org 
list, but we don't necessarily have the same predisposition toward the "urn" issue as the people on the urn-ietf list (I'm on both lists, btw). 
I'd like to think that we will be more open minded on the uri list, although every individual has their own biases. 
In case it is not clear to folks (I know Stu knows), if W3C (including its members) decide to start a working group with some specific agenda, then that group, and its own list, will very likely have adopted some assumptions to constrain its work. 
But that should not affect the openness of the public uri list.
