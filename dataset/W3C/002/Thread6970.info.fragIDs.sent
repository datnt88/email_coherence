<s> God help us, but there now seem to be two URI lists.  </s>
<s> This seems not only redundent but potentially destructive.  </s>
<s> The W3C seems exactly the right place for these discussions to be carried forward and archived.  </s>
<s> Could we agree to annoint that list as The Place  </s>

<s> So, it is neither better, nor worse to run it at W3C. Regarding two lists, you might mix up the URN-discussions list and the URI discussion list.  </s>
<s> Both lists were hosted at Bunyip, but thy are still different.  </s>
<s> They are both belonging (or was regarding the URI mailing list) to IETF working groups.  </s>

<s> I guess what I am suggesting is that URN-IETF and URI@w3.orf have overlapping objectives and, judging from the traffic, could be conflated.  </s>
<s> And yes, I agree with the other sentiments expressed... need for open discussion, etc.  </s>

<s> I'd like to think that we will be more open minded on the uri list, although every individual has their own biases.  </s>
<s> In case it is not clear to folks (I know Stu knows), if W3C (including its members) decide to start a working group with some specific agenda, then that group, and its own list, will very likely have adopted some assumptions to constrain its work.  </s>
<s> But that should not affect the openness of the public uri list.  </s>
