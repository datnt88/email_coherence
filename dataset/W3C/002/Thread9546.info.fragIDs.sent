<s> We look for 'something1' that 'etc:supportsProofOf' 'something2' where 'something1' is intended to be some engine, but it's actually not important to know for the problem description and 'something2' is intended to be an entailment testcase thing described via 'etc:blunt', 'etc:kind' and 'etc:sharp' properties like in http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/entailment/etc001.n3 (or the .nt or the .rdf)  </s>
