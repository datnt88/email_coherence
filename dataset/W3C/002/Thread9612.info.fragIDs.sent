<s> Skippable. Things have moved on a lot in datatyping since the last version of this.  </s>
<s> We have a new initiative for moving forward which is "where the action is" on datatyping currently.  </s>
<s> However, I think it best to do another of these posts to capture the input received after V4. An updated summary of the datatyping issues, as I currently understand them.  </s>
<s> Overall Status: If all the proposed withdrawls and Sergey's union trick for B1 are accepted then the only can't live with left is Jeremy's on B8. Changes: o Propose withdraw B10 as its fixed by Pat's model theory.  </s>
<s> o Sergey withdraws B5, but DanC is not convinced.  </s>
<s> o Propose withdraw B4, all accept literals can be treated as tidy for datatyping o B1: Sergey suggests union trick o notes B10 also affects S-P and S-B.  </s>
<s> Issue B1: status: proposed resolution In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g. mary age "10" .  </s>
<s> age rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> and mary ageD _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a xsd:integer.map  </s>
<s> "10" .  </s>
<s> two properties have to be used, age and ageD , in this example.  </s>
<s> Sergey suggests that the range of age can be the UNION of  </s>
<s> xsdr:integer.map and xsdr:integer.lex and xsdr:integer.val.  </s>
<s> Patrick: are you satisfied?  </s>
<s> Can't Live With: PatrickS Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value status: agreed that S-A allows this and TDL does not.  </s>
<s> S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value: _:i xsd:double "10.1" .  </s>
<s> _:i xsd:double.de  </s>
<s> "10,1" .  </s>
<s> Issue B3: the self entailment issue status: Withdrawn in favour of B4: From: [[I accept the reasoning above; it doesn't address my objection; it' just shows that my example wasn't very good.  </s>
<s> Sergey's example makes the point better:]] B9 also added in response to Graham's request.  </s>
<s> Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code status: propose withdraw, literals are tidy This is similar to B3. I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.  </s>
<s> Under TDL, consider the graph: _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title (_, "10") .  </s>
<s> mary age (_, "10").  </s>
<s> Does not entail: _:x dc:Title _:y .  </s>
<s> _:z age _:y .  </s>
<s> Literals are no longer pairs, so this is no longer true.  </s>
<s> DanC: do you accept Can't Live With: DanC Issue B5: Storage Requirements status: DanC disputes TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.  </s>
<s> Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered datatype datatype.lex  </s>
<s> datatype.val  </s>
<s> datatype.map  </s>
<s> Sergey: Do you agree this is the case?  </s>
<s> If not, how many URI's are required to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.  </s>
<s> Issue B7: Complexity status: agreed S has several ways of expressing the same thing.  </s>
<s> An RDF processor has to be aware of them all.  </s>
<s> Supported by Jeremy's error cases message and a message from Andy Seaborne to rdf comments: Issue B8: S-B encourages logically (sic) errors in the application type processing.  </s>

<s> Given: _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title "10" .  </s>
<s> mary age "10" .  </s>

<s> = mary , and knowing that the age of mary is 10, may conclude that the title of the film is also 10. Can't Live With: Jeremy Issue B9: In TDL a document does not entail itself status: Withdrawn.  </s>
<s> Under TDL, does: foo dc:Title "W3C" .  </s>
<s> entail foo dc:Title "W3C" .  </s>
<s> yes.  </s>
<s> Issue B10: Say what you mean status: propose for withdrawl (Pat's model theory fixes) The concern here is that in TDL, a literal denotes a pair consisting of a value and a lexical representation of that value.  </s>
<s> The problem is then that the german representation of floating point number, e.g. "10,5" is different from the english representation, e.g. "10.5".  </s>
<s> Thus under TDL a german 10 and a half is a different thing from an english 10 and a half.  </s>
<s> More formally, under TDL: foo eg:size _:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:s1 rdf:value "10,5" .  </s>
<s> _:s1 rdf:type xsd:double-de .  </s>
<s> bar eg:size _:s2 .  </s>
<s> _:s2 rdf:value "10.5" .  </s>
<s> _:s2 rdf:type xsd:double .  </s>
<s> does not entail: foo eg:size _:s .  </s>
<s> bar eg:size _:s .  </s>
<s> Note that S-P and S-B have a similar problem.  </s>
<s> Pat's new model theory addresses this.  </s>
<s> In both TDL and S-P, the bNode denotes something from the value space, not a pair.  </s>
<s> Does anyone disagree.  </s>
<s> I understood that in http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/datatyping/#s-p the bNode denotes a pair of a value and its lexical representation but I clw Pat's new model theory ;-) Jos  </s>
<s> Well, actually I suggested it... ;-)  </s>
<s> but I'm very glad Sergey and I now seem to "connect" on this understanding.  </s>
<s> Maybe.  </s>
<s> If that means that a datatype URI denotes the whole datatype and nothing but the datatype so help us RDF, and the *.(map|val|lex) distinctions live only in the MT, then yes.  </s>
<s> But then, that's what I've been saying all along ;-)  </s>

<s> I'm clearly losing the plot.  </s>

<s> If that means agree, then so am I.  </s>
<s> To keep my life bearable, I need unconditional yes/no answers to such questions, please.  </s>
