<s> Pat shoeSize 10 Such that 10 is something other than a string/literal?  </s>
<s> If so,  </s>
<s> what is it?  </s>
<s> A URI? A local ID?  </s>
<s> Grounded in what base (a'la  </s>
<s> xml:base)?  </s>
<s> Well, I do.  </s>
<s> The motivating example for me was the use of range information to fix a datatype, as in aaa shoeSize 10 .  </s>
<s> shoeSize rdfs:Range xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> which seems to me to be eminently simple.  </s>
<s> Obviously, the literal should be interpreted using xsd:integer.  </s>
<s> No need to apply rules or rewrite using bnodes; you just use the literal in the triple.  </s>
<s> Ahhh, but what if we have aaa shoeSize 0x12 .  </s>
<s> shoeSize rdfs:range xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> Hmmm.... xsd:integer requires a decimal notation.  </s>
<s> It may also be that the person making the statement about shoe size is not the one asserting the range constraint.  </s>
<s> That might be a localized interpretation.  </s>
<s> So just how does a system *know* how to interpret '0x12' as an xsd:integer?  </s>
<s> ASSERTION: Typed data literals must have local type defined that is inseparable from the lexical form embodied in the literal value.  </s>
<s> Range asserted interpretation does not suffice for interpretation of the lexical form.  </s>
<s> The alternate is to impose the requirement that all lexical forms of all data types be valid lexical forms for all superordinate types of that data type.  </s>
<s> Ouch.  </s>
<s> Tough to verify... Granted, XML Schema seems to comply with such a requirement (I haven't checked rigorously though).  </s>
<s> But whether we could actualy empose such a requirement (either reasonably or practically) is questionable.  </s>
<s> ...#me ...#shoeSize _:x.  </s>
<s> _:x ...rdf-syntax-ns#type ...#integer .  </s>
<s> _:x ...#decimalRep "10".  </s>
<s> This representation presumes that the lexical form is separate from the data type, which is not the case  </s>
<s> (neither for RDF or XML, nor for a given programming  </s>
<s> language).  </s>
<s> The typing system of RDF does not apply to canonical internal representations of values in value spaces, but of lexical forms corresponding to values in value spaces.  </s>
<s> As such, the #decimalRep could be seen as superfluous, as one would expect that #integer would define the lexical space and the literal value would conform to that space.  </s>
<s> Those languages which allow for multiple notations of the same data type in lexical forms utilized mechanisms in the lexical form itself to differentiate those variant notations.  </s>
<s> The above treatment seems to me to presume that no lexical space is defined for the data type at all, therefore it must be specified separately, and that I think is incorrect.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> So, the simple types do appear to follow this.  </s>
<s> The derived types satisfy this by construction.  </s>
<s> Derivation by restriction satisfies this by construction.  </s>
<s> Derivation by list and by union satisfies this by virtue of not having a superclass (other than anySimpleType) The primitive datatypes inherit from anySimpleType, which appears by definition to be a union of all the other types, and hence Patrick's condition is satisfied.  </s>
<s> The complex types (which have XML elements - see message later this morning) seem more difficult, and I think in general Patrick's condition is false.  </s>
<s> I am new to XML schema though, having only read part 2 last week, and parts 0 and 1 last night.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> But just because XML Schema types satisfy this condition (possibly by intent, possibly by coincidence) I'm not sure we can impose such a condition on any arbitrary data types.  </s>
<s> Thus, should one wish to use hex notation for integers, and defines a subclass of xsd:integer called xxx:hex it would not have a lexical form that is valid for xsd:integer.  </s>
<s> I think we need instead to take an approach by which all typed data literals are specified locally for type and range definitions are only prescriptive for locally typed values.  </s>
<s> I never intended to include complex types insofar as the above condition was stated.  </s>
<s> Though, as complex types must at some point terminate in simple types, the condition still applies.  </s>
<s> Though it opens up the can of worms about what it means to say that some subgraph is of a given XML Schema complex type, when the purpose of that complex type is to define  </s>
<s> an XML subtree, not an RDF subgraph.  </s>
<s> I would interpret our charter to mean that we relate RDF to XML Schema *simple* data types only, as they apply to literals, and not complex data types (but I may very well be wrong there).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> The label in the triple itself is a string, of course, just like all the other labels.  </s>
<s> Urirefs are strings, too.  </s>
<s> So '10' is a string (which is also a numeral).  </s>
<s> On the other hand, 10 is a number, as in '10=6+4'.  </s>
<s> The question is whether the literal label *denotes* a string or not.  </s>
<s> I want to be able to write a numeral and have it denote a number.  </s>
<s> If we interpret the double quotes as genuine quotation then that is impossible: all such quotations denote strings.  </s>
<s> I guess its just a literal.  </s>
<s> (But maybe, for you, "literal" *means* "string" ?  </s>
<s> There seems to be one subcommunity which takes that for granted.  </s>
<s> If so, however, there seems to be little point in this entire discussion, since obviously a string doesn't have properties like being base-64.  </s>
<s> Its just a bare sequence of characters. )  </s>
<s> Well, I do.  </s>
<s> The motivating example for me was the use of range information to fix a datatype, as in aaa shoeSize 10 .  </s>
<s> shoeSize rdfs:Range xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> which seems to me to be eminently simple.  </s>
<s> Obviously, the literal should be interpreted using xsd:integer.  </s>
<s> No need to apply rules or rewrite using bnodes; you just use the literal in the triple.  </s>
<s> It doesn't, probably.  </s>
<s> Look, I'm not expecting miracles to occur.  </s>
<s> All that the MT extension can do is to make sure that datatyping information is tallied up with literal labels in a sensible way.  </s>
<s> If someone uses a literal that isn't the right type, then something  </s>
<s> ought to barf (that something would probably be outside RDF, and  </s>
<s> would know a lot about the intimate details of the datatyping scheme.)  </s>
<s> So in this case, RDF would tell the xsd: expert that '0x12' was supposed to be an integer, and that expert would tell it to go to hell.  </s>
<s> Superordinate *datatypes*, not types in general.  </s>
<s> But yes, it does seem to require that.  </s>
<s> But is that so hard to verify?  </s>
<s> I'm assuming  </s>
<s> that we will be using genuine, published datatype schemes with URIs,  </s>
<s> not just random stuff put together in a back room.  </s>
<s> But even there, as long as mydatatype:frobjet is not asserted to also be an xsd:number, or some such, then there are no superordinate datatypes to get in the way.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should ask our Chair what the intended scope of this discussion is supposed to be.  </s>
<s> By 'datatype' should we understand only XML datatypes, or *any* datatyping scheme that anyone could possibly dream up, or something in between?  </s>
<s> Are there any general assumptions that we can make about all 'reasonable' datatyping schemes?  </s>
