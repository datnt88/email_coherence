<s> I'm trying to sort out the similarities and differences between cHTML, HDML,  </s>
<s> WML, and XHTML Basic.  </s>
<s> I know that cHTML and HDML are not W3C Recommendations, but you *do* have descriptive documents on your site.  </s>
<s> Every time I want to check a point, though, I have to go through a convoluted process of finding the papers again.  </s>
<s> (Yes, I've bookmarked them,  </s>
<s> but sometimes what I remember reading is in a related page.) I expect to find links under HTML or Mobile, but no luck.  </s>
<s> Just because a paper isn't a Recommendation, doesn't mean that people don't  </s>
<s> want to access it.  </s>
<s> The whole point of the Web is to link related resources  </s>
<s> for clear and easy access.  </s>
<s> It would be great if the main categories (your left-hand list) could link to all related resources (even if they're not approved).  </s>
<s> If not that, then at least some kind of site map which lists the  </s>
<s> available papers.  </s>
<s> Considering that accessibility is a strong point with the W3C, it's very frustrating to find your site so difficult to navigate.  </s>

<s> Hi Doninique, Thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> Yes, I know I can do a search, but I can't NAVIGATE to pages I want and that frustrates me.  </s>
<s> It's one thing if the information is (more or less) obviously in a database (such as Microsoft's Knowledge Base - I wouldn't want to navigate THAT- ugh!), but it's another if the information is in (mostly) linked html documents.  </s>
<s> It breaks Web usability to have orphaned pages.  </s>
<s> (I've been writing HTML since '94, so I'm not exactly a novice at this.) Also, it makes me wonder what other related information you have that I won't find just because I don't already know you have it.  </s>
<s> The W3C is *THE* Web organization.  </s>
<s> You can't afford (in the prestige sense) to have frustrated users.  </s>
<s> In order to lead by example, your example must be nearly perfect.  </s>
<s> If users come away with the idea that your site is haphazard and unorganized, how can you expect them to respect the ideas and ideals you are working toward?  </s>
<s> I didn't mean that your left-hand navigation should include all your documents, but that all documents related to a category should be listed in the category pages.  </s>
<s> For example, the cHTML and HDML documents should be referenced from both the HTML and the Mobile category pages.  </s>
<s> Oh, sure, put them at the bottom under a heading of "Things We Don't Recommend" or some such, but at least list them in the obvious places.  </s>
<s> If not that, then add a category at the bottom, "Unadopted Proposals," maybe.  </s>
<s> Foster care for these unwanted orphans.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, these category pages are your best ally in fighting your information management problem.  </s>
<s> Make these pages into tables of contents and severely limit the introductory text.  </s>
<s> Set up a template for the structure of each category page (section headings) and you'll find yourself a long way to an organized site with complete linking.  </s>
<s> Some suggestions: "Current Standards," "Previous Standards and Drafts," "Related Information," and "Related but Not Recommended Information."  </s>
<s> It should be easy - although tedious - to discover which documents are not referenced from anywhere and figure out where to add the links.  </s>
<s> Most importantly, make them consistent!  </s>
<s> One other usability note: because most of the navigation on your home page is accomplished through plain text links in yellow boxes, I did not register the blue bar graphic as a navigation element at all.  </s>
<s> I saw it as part of the header graphic information and ignored it.  </s>
<s> (Especially as it doesn't reappear on all your other pages.) Consistency is essential in designing navigation.  </s>

<s> All our technical reports are listed on one page: I agree they should be linked from other pages as well, but you have to consider one point: to put a link in the HTML home page to a "thing we don't recommend" is giving it a much bigger impact than what we want: users will go and see it more often, and further more, search engines ala Google will give it a much bigger weight in their results.  </s>
