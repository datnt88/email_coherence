<s> Recursion would have made it possible to move, copy, etc., an entire compound document in one step -- to treat it as a single object.  </s>

<s> Short answer: recursive operation for copy, move, lock, and delete are  </s>
<s> being moved to a separate specification.  </s>
<s> At present, the DAV protocol spec.  </s>
<s> will only specify level 0 operations (or should it be level infinity  </s>
<s> operations?)  </s>
<s> This is the focus of the new specification, which will start using the recursive operation descriptions in draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-01.txt as its base, as modified by discussion at Orem.  </s>
<s> This is still TBD, but I hope this spec.  </s>
<s> will pop out the door a few months after the base specification.  </s>
<s> I still need to work out with Saveen Reddy a schedule for development of this document.  </s>
<s> Yes. This is still within our charter -- it's just a spec.  </s>
<s> packaging/timing issue.  </s>
<s> things  </s>
<s> Recursive operations will not be ignored, they will just be developed at a  </s>
<s> slower rate than the base specification.  </s>
<s> The intent of this decision is to remove a contentious item from the base specification to allow it to progress faster.  </s>
<s> What I have been hearing from vendors interested in implementing WebDAV is the need for speed so that WebDAV doesn't miss the next round of development cycles.  </s>
<s> This isn't a repeat of SEARCH, which grew so big it needs its own working group.  </s>

<s> Also Judith, the new specification actually makes it easier to deal with compound documents.  </s>
<s> One of the discoveries of the arguments over depth is that compound documents are not collections.  </s>
<s> Just because something responds to INDEX, which a compound document can, does not mean it is a collection.  </s>
<s> A collection has additional behaviors, such as supporting addref and delref, which compound documents do not necessarily have.  </s>
<s> As such if you copy the URL of a compound document, you copy the entire document.  </s>
<s> If, on the other hand, you did an INDEX and got a URL to chapter 1 of the compound document and then copied that URL, you would only copy chapter 1.  </s>
<s> You need to think it through a couple of times before the logic all makes sense but then I think you will find it is a more natural way to manipulate compound documents.  </s>
