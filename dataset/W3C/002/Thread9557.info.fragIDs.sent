I suggest we resolve the rdfs-container-membership-superProperty by defining one: 
e.g. rdfs:contains 
I suggest we then declare rdfs-constraining-containers as out of scope on the basis that it can be addressed by DAML+OIL. 
All indications are that OWL will contrinue to address this issue. 
The DAML+OIL mantra is: This is the class of resources all of whose rdfs:contains edges point to a resource of type eg:ElementsConstrainedToThisClass. 
To have a Bag, a Seq or an Alt with such a constrained declare the resource to have both type Bag and type ConstrainedContainer. Alternatively construct a new class that subclasses both this class and the desired container class. 
daml:onProperty rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#contains"/ daml:toClass rdf:resource="http://example.org/ElementsConstrainedToThisClass"/

Brilliant; thanks Jeremy then I think we can close this with a clear conscience.

I would be grateful if Mike and Jos checked my DAML+OIL first.

Looks good. 
Does this mean that rdfs:contains would be a superproperty of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc.?

We've already decided this once. 
The current editors draft of RDFS has rdfs:member, though could do with help giving it a nice precise rdfs:comment text. 
Suggestions welcomed. 
And the wooshing noise as deadlines zoom by. 
I'm back in Bristol working on two things til May: SWAD-Europe (new EU SemWeb project, beginning May 1st), and RDFS spec editing. 
I've discovered I get more RDFS work done when in Bristol, and plan to sync up with Brian f2f next week to look at the state of RDF Schema. 
My apologies to all for the sorry state of my work on this to date. 
Excuses available on request. 
A practical question re RDFS: I need to redo the figures. 
What is the state of the art in tools (ideally Linux, MacOS X also a possibility) for creating node'n'arc diagrams suitable for inclusion in specs...?

Sorry about the name confusion Dan. 
I've just sent the agenda with this on, but am of course happy to change the name. 
Oh yes, I'd love to know; can we use svg yet?

We already do: and with embedded rdf/xml too :)

The original diagrams (png, gif, svg) that are in the rdf syntax and primer documents were made via IsaViz http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz/ IsaViz - A Visual Authoring Tool for RDF Announced : 2002-03-20, W3C's Semantic Web Advanced Development initiative announces the release of IsaViz, a visual environment for browsing and authoring RDF models represented as graphs. 
Developed by Emmanuel Pietriga of W3C and Xerox Research Centre Europe, IsaViz is based on the Xerox Visual Transformation Machine, Hewlett-Packard's Jena, Graphviz from AT&amp;T Research, and Apache's Xerces.

I found this tool to be very helpful for creating such diagrams.

I don't think we chose a name before; I picked 'member' as an obviousish one. 
It reads in the (oft-ignored) prefered style of M&amp;S, ie. a member b "A has a member b". 
I don't care much. 
Help with the definition would be good though. 
Anyone want to have a crack at that? 
I'd hope so (by hyperlink if not content negotiation). 
It's the authoring tool situation that I'm mostly asking about. 
Last time around it was all done in MS Word98, but I don't currently have a windows box handy... 
Dan 
OpenOffice's Draw can export SVG. 
I've been playing a little, but haven't got it working yet. 
Brian 
Not that this is necessarily an optimal method, but since you mentioned OS-X... 
I'm creating the illustrations for the Datatyping WD with PowerPoint (MS Office for OS-X), one illustration per slide, saving the slides as JPEG, and using GraphicConverter to crop the images. 
I started to use GraphViz, but the graphs were too wide for my tastes and often not exactly as I would like them, so I took the brute force, maximal control approach and I'm quite happy with the results. 
Obviously, it's more work than just autogenerating the graphs from the RDF, and also more work to verify that the graph actually is correct per the RDF, but given the nature &amp; import of the document... 
Just FYI... Cheers, Patrick 
I think we can close this with a clear conscience. 
jeremy: 
the DAML+OIL in seems OK to me and to the point Jos
