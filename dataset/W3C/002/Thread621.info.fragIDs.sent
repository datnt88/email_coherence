<s> I downloaded TidyGUI for the first time yesterday.  </s>
<s> I am primarily interested in detecting syntactic errors, e.g., detecting omission of /TABLE .  </s>
<s> I am not interested in stylistic thingees, such as when to (ab)use P or BR .  </s>
<s> Is Tidy the wrong tool for my interests?  </s>
<s> I am puzzled by some of the spacing decisions being made by Tidy.  </s>
<s> Is there available a complete description of what Tidy does?  </s>
<s> For example, I have the following construct in a number of files (Note that the URLs below are not, as far as I know, actual URLs): P BLOCKQUOTE B Usage Note: /B If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.  </s>
<s> /BLOCKQUOTE The intent was to get an indented block as follows: Usage Note: If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.  </s>
<s> Running TidyGUI, this gets converted to: p If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.  </s>
<s> /p This breaks the run-in/dictionary style.  </s>
<s> Why was that done?  </s>
<s> According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P the only elements allowed inside a p tag are defined by %inline; %inline;, in turn, is defined at blockquote .  </s>
<s> Tidy has made a guess at what you wanted and changed your HTML to legal (or "tidied") HTML.  </s>
<s> Gary  </s>
<s> Tidy is overzealous because the current draft of HTML 4.01 that I downloaded does not preclude empty paragraphs, rather it only discourages their use.  </s>
<s> Tidy should have an option to retain empty paragraphs, since they are currently syntactically valid, and offer an option of deleting them.  </s>
<s> Presently, there is no way to retain empty paragraphs with Tidy.  </s>
<s> p b UsageNote /b : If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.  </s>
<s> /p p b UsageNote /b : If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.  </s>
<s> /p  </s>
<s> Someone could tell me how to leave the list, please ?  </s>
