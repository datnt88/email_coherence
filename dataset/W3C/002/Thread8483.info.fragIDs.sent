<s> Colleagues, I'm wrapping up my action item from last week [1] and will start the process for updating the WD and ietf-draft of the requirements document [1,2] and then asking the IESG that it publish the draft as an Information RFC.  </s>

<s> One question that came up while working on Section 4.3.1 was the comment (which was already there) about Location being implied by application context.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to have an example of this.  </s>
<s> In particular, I'm  </s>
<s> having some difficulty understanding how a signature verification algorithm will tell the difference between implied Location versus having no Location mean 'this' document.  </s>
<s> Originally, I had thought that an empty Location (or one that starts with a  </s>
<s> # fragment if we allow fragments in Location) should mean 'this' document.  </s>
<s> Another question about Location had to do with the desired ability to switch between embedded and detached signatures without breaking the signature How will this be done without breaking the signature given that the Location will change?  </s>
<s> At first I assumed that the only way to do this was with the fabled Location-by-application-context, but then the question above popped into mind.  </s>
<s> Note that Location is part of what gets signed by the signature's digest, so there aren't even transformations that can omit it.  </s>

<s> I think this is intended primarily for light weight protocol applications.  </s>
<s> Typically no Location would mean some part of the current document while just a fragment means some particular element of the current document.  </s>
<s> In other words, no Location can be an abbreviation for some XPath type filter that is fixed for that application and type of message, such as signing the entire message/document less the signature, while a fragment can only refer to one element and is all of that element, so to speak.  </s>
<s> If the Location is specified by id, you can move the stuff around anywhere in the current document and still find it.  </s>
<s> If the Location is some clever application specific scheme, foobar:great-stuff , maybe it can locate the data anywhere in that application's universe via some directory system or something, whether it is in the current document or not.  </s>

<s> Traversal of such a reference should not result in an additional retrieval action.  </s>
<s> However, if the URI reference occurs in a context that is always intended to result in a new request, as in the case of HTML's FORM element, then an empty URI reference represents the base URI of the current document and should be replaced by that URI when transformed into a request.  </s>
