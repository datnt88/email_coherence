<s> Thank you Patrick for your strawman proposal and provoking a discussion which I hope will ensure we express ourselves carefully and wisely.  </s>
<s> Your action is recorded in the draft minutes as: ACTION 2002-12-06#3 PatrickS: draft one paragraph about rdfs:isDefinedBy and other terms to draw out them for readers of the primer which looking at the transcript: was result of a comment from Frank: FrankM: isDefinedBy mentioned not described in the primer.  </s>
<s> Do people want that added?  </s>
<s> If so, let me know.  </s>
<s> With regards to isDefinedBy, I think it would be fine for the primer to say nothing about it.  </s>
<s> If the WG felt that the primer would be enhanced by a short description, I might suggest something along the lines of the following would describe the WG's decision: It is often useful to indicate in an RDF graph where the definition of a class or a property, or indeed any resource, may be found.  </s>
<s> The rdfs:isDefinedBy property may be used for this purpose.  </s>
<s> This property may be used to indicate an RDF Schema that describes the resource, however, RDF imposes no constraints on the values this property.  </s>
<s> If the resource that is the value of such a property is retrieved from the web, it may be an RDF Schema, but there is no guarantee that it will be.  </s>
<s> This text lacks the lightness of touch and ease on the readers eye that I would hope for in the primer, so does require some help from the editor, but I hope indicates the sort of thing we might usefully say in this document.  </s>

<s> Writing with the lightness of touch and ease on the readers eye for which he is so well known, the editor asks: when might the WG be expected to express its considered opinion on this subject?  </s>

<s> Interestingly, the text in the Vocabulary document would suggest that any value of rdfs:isDefinedBy is expected to be an RDF schema, since  </s>
<s> it is a subPropertyOf rdfs:seeAlso, which is described in the Vocabulary doc as "rdfs:seeAlso The property rdfs:seeAlso is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional RDF information about the subject resource."  </s>
<s> Perhaps "RDF" is there by accident?  </s>
<s> "RDF information" sure sounds like  </s>
<s> an RDF Schema to me... Patrick  </s>
<s> One of my comments on the schema draft that I have sent to Dan is that's not what I recall the WG agreeing, but I confess I haven't checked the record yet.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I suggest Frank you set your own deadline and use your judgement as editor of what is the sense of the WG, e.g. if you haven't heard by ... it will/will not go in.  </s>
