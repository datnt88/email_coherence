<s> I've read the new draft.  </s>
<s> it's great.  </s>
<s> I have sent all the minor comments (typos) to the editor.  </s>
<s> I have two that are at least somewhat substantial.  </s>
<s> property naming  </s>
<s> There is still some inconsistency in choice of property names, although much improved.  </s>
<s> Some names are formed by concatenation (e.g. lockscope) and some by hyphenation.  </s>
<s> The latter are easier to read and if you could use these uniformly it would be great.  </s>
<s> opaquelocktoken (5.4) It seems kind of weird to me that opaque lock tokens *require* the GUID mechanism.  </s>
<s> Surely it sufficies to just say that the tokens must be unique,  </s>
<s> and leave it to servers to figure out how to do this.  </s>
<s> GUIDs are certainly one way, but there are surely others.  </s>
<s> Let me put this question another way.  </s>
<s> Suppose One wanted to use a lock token that was not based on GUID.  </s>
<s> I see two ways to do it 1) Define a new URI scheme (foolocktoken) and extend Lock-Token to return and accept these kind in addition to opaquelocktoken 2) Make opaquelocktoken itself extensible by adding a scheme to the front e.g. opaquelocktoken:guid for the ones in the DAV spec.  </s>
<s> If opaquelocktoken really just means GUID, why not call it GUID and be done with it?  </s>
<s> Also, the GUID internet draft is expired.  </s>
<s> What is the status of it?  </s>

<s> opaquelocktoken - I believe section 5.3 addresses all of your concerns.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> repeat it here: A lock token is a URI that identifies a particular lock.  </s>
<s> A lock token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lock-token response header, and can also be discovered through lock discovery on a resource.  </s>
<s> Lock token URIs are required to be unique across all resources for all time.  </s>
<s> This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be submitted across resources and servers without fear of confusion.  </s>
<s> This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  </s>
<s> However resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the uniqueness requirements.  </s>
<s> However, at the author's meeting, we discussed the problem with the GUID draft having expired.  </s>
<s> Alex Hopmann will be writing up appropriate language.  </s>
<s> Basically, however, opaquelocktoken is just one scheme, as specified above, ANY scheme may be used, so long as it is unique across all resources for all time.  </s>
<s> However the IESG gets unhappy when you make a requirement like that without providing at least one mechanism that someone can use to meet the requirement, hence the introduction of opaquelocktoken.  </s>

<s> This refers to the names chosen for properties that have compound noun names.  </s>
<s> Sometimes the compound noun components are joined with hyphens, e.g. get-content-type, and other times they are joined without a hyphen, e.g. locktimeout (not lock-timeout).  </s>
<s> I claim that WebDAV would be (slightly) better if all the XML properties were named using just one of these two styles.  </s>
<s> It is a minor point affecting readability.  </s>
<s> You are completely right.  </s>
<s> I offer no excuse for overlooking it.  </s>
<s> I beg your pardon.  </s>
<s> Ahh now I understand.  </s>
<s> I will leave the decision to change the names to Jim, mostly because he currently has the golden copy of the document, =).  </s>
