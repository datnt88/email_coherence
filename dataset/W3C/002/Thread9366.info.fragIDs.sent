<s> I had a reaction against the wording ....  </s>
<s> (Sorry - this sort of mailing is tedious).  </s>
<s> Graphs for me are sets and cannot have duplicates to remove.  </s>
<s> How about: Propose the WG ACTION Pat to ensure that: the model theory uses graphs with no duplicate arcs Further the WG notes that: o an RDF/XML document may contains duplicate triples o an n-triples document may contains duplicate triples o and such triples map to a single arc in a graph.  </s>
<s> (Omitting the last point would leave Pat more wriggle room to take a multiset view of graphs if he so chooses).  </s>

<s> Well, we are the Core, guys: we can define them any way we like :-) .  </s>
<s> RDF graphs are not mathematical graphs in any case (they seem to be directed partially labelled pseudographs, as near as I can make out from the various on-line mathematical lexica, but I promise not to tell anyone about that.)

<s> As I won't be present, my comments to some issues below:  </s>
<s> OK, but I'd draw attention to the start of section 2 as addressing (and completing) the specific action.  </s>
<s> There is also much other material in this message.  </s>
<s> I like the direction here, and am happy to let the experts propose details.  </s>
<s> [See separate message]  </s>
<s> OK ( ... but on the grounds that they *will be* resolved by the new approach taken to defining the syntax?)  </s>
<s> I'm not sure exactly what the "proposal" is here.  </s>
<s> And I can't see if the Model Theory approach to data typing being worked up by Peter-FPS and Pat is really covered here.  </s>
<s> Concerning the specific suggestions: SUG1 - I have no strong view (though I'd be reluctant to require our readers to also read [UML] and [CWM]?).  </s>
<s> Being able to use XSD datatypes seems to be a given for this forum, though I'd prefer we were not limited to the primitive datatypes introduced there.  </s>
<s> (I've already bemoaned the lack of arbitrary rational numbers in XSD primitive datatypes.) SUG2 - I generally favour of this, but it seems to me that attempts to do this without some level of additional model theory support have their own difficulties (see my message: SUG3 - unless I am missing something here (which I suspect I am), I've seen plenty of use-cases where this just doesn't cut the mustard.  </s>
<s> Hence, I don't find myself agreeing with: Regarding the model theory for datatyping, I don't think that datatyping needs some special treatment if we go along with SUG2 and SUG3 .  </s>
<s> Of course, it would be fine to introduce a "shortcut" notation for datatyping in the model theory if necessary, just like ICEXT is defined as a shortcut in the MT draft.  </s>
<s> (a) I think we'll want some kind of MT support for datatyping.  </s>
<s> (b) "shortcut" sounds to me like a syntactic issue, so doesn't help us remove required MT support.  </s>
