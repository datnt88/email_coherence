Subject: forest grammar/tree regular expression for RDF Resent-Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 21:19:34 -0400 (EDT) Resent-From: www-rdf-comments@w3.org I hope the RDFCore WG will consider the forest grammar/tree regular 
expression as a specification of the formal RDF XML syntax. 
The unordered 
nature of RDF is best described as a forest grammar and this presents difficulties for traditional XML schema languages such as DTDs. 
I have specified this as a RELAXNG schema for RDF 
syntax under the issue: 
An advantage of specifying the grammar in this language is that it has a good formal semantics which is based on the formal semantics of XDuce. 
formalism in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-formal appears to be based on XDuce as well which is referenced. 
Because I realize the politics around RELAXNG, I have converted this to the language used by XDuce and by the XML Schema Formalism: 
It is really quite simple.

Very nice! 
It has a few special cases that I don't think are necessary (e.g. rdf:value is just another propertyElement/propertyAttribute, and rdf:Description is just a typedNode) but other than that, it seems to be quite a compact and precise description of the RDF syntax. 
Is there an online service ala XSV that checks documents w.r.t. this sort of schema? 
let's see if I can find one by following my nose from the namespace name... sigh... 404 at http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/0.9 
Ah.. that's even easier to read. 
Production 4 is ambiguous, no? 4.type description = rdf:Description[ idAboutAttr?, bagIdAttr?, propAttr?, 
propertyElt* typedNode rdf:Description/ matches both alternatives, no? 
As I say, I don't see any need to special-case rdf:Description in the grammar. 
And I must have been mis-reading the other syntax; I don't see the rdf:value special case here. 
Where is the definition of the literal type? 
I don't see any use of the 'any' type.

(on Jonathan Borden's RELAXNG work...) (msg trimmed to focus on rdf:Description question) 
If we take this reading of the syntax, then the presence of rdf:Description asserts an rdf:type relationship between the described resource and an rdfs:Class called rdf:Description. 
I've seen nothing in RDF elsewhere to support the claim that RDF defines such a class; M+S is pretty clear that the rdf:Description construct is pure encoding syntax. 
If we were to decide that such a (goofily named) class exists, would it be something like a subclass of rdfs:Resource? 
Your proposal seems to make the rules for our XML encoding syntax simpler at the cost of making the resulting structures more complex. 
Dan 
That's not what I meant; I don't think it's what I said, either. 
The question of what triples a document denotes once you've decided it matches the grammar is a whole other kettle of worms. 
Yes, in that part, we'd need an exception ala Don't emit a type arc if the element name is rdf:Description But that needn't gunk up the grammar. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
OK, fair enough. 
I read you as suggesting this was just another typedNode, with all the usual properties of a typed node, such as encoding claims about rdf:types... 
I read your "don't see any need to special-case rdf:Description in the grammar" as "don't see any need to special-case rdf:Description in the syntax". 
Dan 
I did suggest some time ago that rdf:Description might be regarded as equivalent to rdfs:Resource. 
I'm not sure that it really matters, though.

Dan, can you (briefly) elaborate on what you mean by 'encoding syntax' ?

I meant that it was solely concerned with RDF's angle-bracketted representation; or rather, with one of the (possibly many) XML representations of the RDF triples data structure. 
Other representations of RDF in angle brackets (eg. 
using XLink) might not have anything corresponding to rdf:Description.
