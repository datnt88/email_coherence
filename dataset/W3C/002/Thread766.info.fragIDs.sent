The Web Standards Project (WASP) ..... ..... is conducting a campaign to encourage Internet users to upgrade their Browsers to new versions which (for the most part) comply with W3C standards and recommendations. 
These Browser versions generally offer full support for HTML 4.x, XHTML 1.0, CSS (Cascading style sheets), etc. 
The WASP page ..... ..... provides gateway links to the following download pages: Microsoft IE 5.5 for Windows Microsoft IE 5.0 Macintosh Edition Netscape 6.01 Opera 5.02 Unix Konqueror 2.0/Linux Mandrake 7.2 (KDE) James Pickering Tucson, Arizona Tools and Information for web pages Authors: Brazilian Cacti in Cultivation: 
James Pickering reminds us: 
So far, so good. 
Now try either of two things. 
(i) Using an "older" browser with Javascript enabled, go to (for example) http://www.alistapart.com/ . 
You'll be brushed off and sent to with NS 3.0 last night; right now I lack the software to try it). 
(ii) Look at the associated "Developer help and tips" page, up to (their idea of) snuff, you won't have much to read; if it is, you'll see that WaSP's first recommendation is to send people packing. 
WaSP recommends the latest version of one of IE, NS, Opera, or Konqueror. 
Maybe I'm an unusual example, but I'm the one I know best, so here goes: On this machine, I prefer to use Netscape 4.x (even though I have a low opinion of it). 
Mere cussedness? 
No. I can't use Konqueror, because I'm using Windows. 
(OK, OK, I suppose I could install Dragonlinux, then KDE, then Konqueror.) 
I'm in Japan and want to be able to read Japanese; Opera is infamous for its inept handling of double-byte character systems such as Japanese. 
The last time I attempted to install MSIE (5.0, via download from MS), the process caused *severe* crashes. 
(The result three-quarters works.) As far as I know, NS is just an AOL-moronized version of Mozilla. 
The Mozilla I tried out a few months ago was rough but interesting; in the meantime, it has metamorphosized into a gargantua of code that won't get off the ground unless it has 64MB of RAM; this machine has 32MB. 
I know damn well that Netscape 4.* has an annoying "burp" when it encounters a meta tag charset specification, that its implementation of CSS1 is screwy, and that it's ignorant of CSS2. 
I don't mind being 
occasionally reminded of this. 
But that's the limit of my patience. 
If WaSP wants to encourage people to upgrade their browsers, fine. 
(Though it might do so with a graphic link weighing in at less than 20kB, pretty though that graphic is.) If on the other hand it wants to encourage 
web-writers to tell would-be visitors with old browsers to buzz off, I say to hell with WaSP.

...... and those are its good points!

Ah, still the old gadfly, Peter! 
:-) But I would like to put in a plug for an excellent (and free) People with Disabilities oriented Browser -- MultiWeb. 
I extoll its virtues and explain it further at: James Pickering Tucson, Arizona Tools and Information for web pages Authors:
