<s> The Web Standards Project (WASP) ..... ..... is conducting a campaign to encourage Internet users to upgrade their Browsers to new versions which (for the most part) comply with W3C standards and recommendations.  </s>

<s> (ii) Look at the associated "Developer help and tips" page, up to (their idea of) snuff, you won't have much to read; if it is, you'll see that WaSP's first recommendation is to send people packing.  </s>
<s> WaSP recommends the latest version of one of IE, NS, Opera, or Konqueror.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm an unusual example, but I'm the one I know best, so here goes: On this machine, I prefer to use Netscape 4.x (even though I have a low opinion of it).  </s>
<s> Mere cussedness?  </s>
<s> No. I can't use Konqueror, because I'm using Windows.  </s>
<s> (OK, OK, I suppose I could install Dragonlinux, then KDE, then Konqueror.)  </s>
<s> I'm in Japan and want to be able to read Japanese; Opera is infamous for its inept handling of double-byte character systems such as Japanese.  </s>
<s> The last time I attempted to install MSIE (5.0, via download from MS), the process caused *severe* crashes.  </s>
<s> (The result three-quarters works.) As far as I know, NS is just an AOL-moronized version of Mozilla.  </s>
<s> The Mozilla I tried out a few months ago was rough but interesting; in the meantime, it has metamorphosized into a gargantua of code that won't get off the ground unless it has 64MB of RAM; this machine has 32MB.  </s>
<s> I know damn well that Netscape 4.* has an annoying "burp" when it encounters a meta tag charset specification, that its implementation of CSS1 is screwy, and that it's ignorant of CSS2.  </s>
