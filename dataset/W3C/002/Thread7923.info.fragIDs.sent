<s> It seems that I just ran into a problem with Web Folders and wondered if  </s>
<s> anybody else has seen this.  </s>
<s> Or if my assumptions are mistaken :-) I set a property on a file like so:  </s>
<s> There is no default namespace defined.  </s>
<s> When I select "Properties" in a Web  </s>
<s> Folder, it pops up an error dialog saying "Unable to display properties."  </s>
<s> I've narrowed it down to exactly this property.  </s>
<s> Just setting this one single property on a file will do it.  </s>
<s> Has anybody else seen this?  </s>
<s> Or duplicate it?  </s>

<s> I never got them working as well... Nor visualisation of extending props, nor setting of standard props like attribs...  </s>
<s> The Webfolder does simply not show them.  </s>
<s> So if anyone has a working sample for a PROPFIND with depth 0 please send it in... But I even tried this with an IIS and the setting of props was not supported ether... Henrik  </s>
<s> If you are doing this with mod_dav, you might be hitting the bug (in mod_dav) I have reported recently: Do you have a trace to verify?  </s>
<s> Totally unrelated to that.  </s>
<s> Sheesh.  </s>

<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> I can reproduce your problem with IE6 + Sharepoint Client.  </s>
<s> It seems that the webfolder client gets the namespace Uri and fails to foresee the case that it may be null.  </s>
<s> What's interesting is that the client is asking for all properties, although it will only display a hardwired set.  </s>
