<s> This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  </s>
<s> Currently, my list of possibles includes: o isDefinedBy semantics revisited o faq-html-compliance o approve test cases: Jan - do you have some you need reviewed?  </s>
<s> o WG comments on charmod WD o daml:collection o mime-types and W3C specs o rdfms-assertion o xml:base feedback o documents schedule Brian  </s>
<s> Datatypes: stake-in-ground vs simpledatatype2 [yeah, I know, slap me...] Patrick  </s>
<s> I regret that you weren't at the after hours conversation last week.  </s>
<s> I found it helpful, and thought Aaron's e-mail summarised what I learnt:  </s>
<s> While I continue to support simpledatatype2 I believe that the group should as much as possible concentrate on getting the current datatype stuff out to the community as a WD.  </s>
<s> As such, I would support the chair in stating that your agenda request is about an issue that is currently not open.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> As do I.  </s>
<s> Aaron's comments may be true for some preceptions of DC, but other applications (actually, most of them, from what I've seen, including I think alot of common perception about DC as well) still take an untidy simpledatatypes2 view of things.  </s>
<s> In fact, I've been working for awhile on some RDF querying stuff that relies on the inline idiom being understood to "provide" a datatype value, and unfortunately since the present stake-in-ground proposal does not offer this (much to my disappointment and due to my own misunderstanding of the MT) I find myself in a position of being a co-editor of a specification that I myself will reject and not use for most of what I am using datatyped RDF for.  </s>
<s> So, clearly, I'm rather concerned.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I didn't mean to imply that getting the present WD finished and out would be held up by discussing the concerns already raised about it by you, myself, Graham, etc.  </s>
<s> I don't know whether Pat or Sergey presently has the lock, but it's not me.  </s>
<s> But I'm also eager to see it get out to the public (both because it's well overdue, and because I expect that the issues already leveled against it will find support in the general RDF community).  </s>
<s> Still, I wonder whether it still reflects the true concensus of the WG... (i.e. would the WG still vote the way it did)  </s>
<s> Hmmmm... well, I consider datatypes to still be an open issue, or at least, to be an issue that still has problem areas and not "a done deal" so to speak.  </s>
<s> But I certainly will understand if Brian deems it to be inappropriate for tomorrow's aggenda.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
