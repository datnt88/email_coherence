<s> I've been thinking along very similar lines.  </s>
<s> See which has a mix of related ideas, some good, some bad, some wrong.  </s>
<s> Let me pick up on one of them and chew on it: the idea that a literal is a self-denoting entity.  </s>
<s> This is a very appealing idea, and it works for strings, but I don't think it can be made to work (without modification) for any other kinds of literal.  </s>
<s> In particular, one of your examples is 'the number 12'.  </s>
<s> But numbers are denoted by numerals, not numbers; numerals, not numbers, are the syntactic labels that we use to label graph nodes.  </s>
<s> So I take it that the intention in treating '12' as a "literal number" is in fact that the *numeral* '12' is the literal, and that its interpretation is fixed to be the number 12 (that is, the number whose prime factors are 2,2 and 3; the square root of 144; denoted variously by the numerals '12' in decimal, '1100' in binary, and '14' in octal).  </s>
<s> But in none of these cases is the numerical literal *identical* to its interpretation.  </s>
<s> Actually, I had a stronger notion, which was that conceptually, the number (not a numeral representation) should be the "label" in a graph.  </s>
<s> Ah, that is a nice idea.  </s>
<s> It has some odd consequences, though.  </s>
<s> Graphs with number labels cannot be stored inside computers, send over packet-switched networks, printed, etc...  </s>
<s> They have to be Platonic graphs, not data structures.  </s>
<s> And why stop at numbers?  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> (Forgive an argument by analogy, but We accept concepts like "the set { 1, 2, 3 }" which is conceptually a set of numbers, not numerals) So it really _is_ the number 1 labelling a node in the graph.  </s>
<s> However, any concrete realisation of such an RDF graph must, of course, use a representation (be it numeral or otherwise); this is true whether it's an "RDF database" or an "RDF/XML serialisation".  </s>
<s> If it makes any sense, I'd like to separate the two notions.  </s>
<s> Hmm. That gives us an extra layer of representation, which I find clunky.  </s>
<s> There is the lexicalisation which encodes the graph-in-the-machine which represents the abstract graph which describes the interpretation....  </s>
<s> Talk is cheap: free, as in beer.  </s>
<s> As in Real Ale, not that Budweiser rubbish.  </s>
<s> I am proud to tell you that here in Pensacola, not half a mile from my house, is McGuires, the first micro-brewery in the US and still the maker of the best Red, Irish Pale Ale and stout you will find within 3000 miles.  </s>

<s> This sets my antenae twitching.  </s>
<s> One of the problems with the earlier M&amp;S document's formal model was that (at least in my interpretation of it) the use of platonic statements, platonic resources etc led to all sorts of horrible confusion.  </s>
<s> This is one of the reasons I felt the need for a model theory and why I preferred to have it based on n-triples - because that was clearly a concete syntax.  </s>
<s> I've bought the idea that the graph is also a concrete syntax, so using that is fine.  </s>
<s> I personally would be real nervous if we were losing the clarity of that distinction between a concrete syntax and what it means.  </s>
<s> We'll be back to graphs containing resources and questions about what exactly is a resource, which so far, we have brilliantly managed not to need to answer.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree.  </s>
<s> Maybe I should have said 'elegant idea'.  </s>

<s> Why indeed.  </s>
<s> The second half to my thinking is "what to do about it"...  </s>
<s> However, any concrete realisation of such an RDF graph must, of course, use a representation (be it numeral or otherwise); this is true whether it's an "RDF database" or an "RDF/XML serialisation".  </s>
<s> If it makes any sense, I'd like to separate the two notions.  </s>
<s> _All_ RDF implementations must represent the graph somehow, yes, and that usually means an extra layer of representation.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that this distinction needs to be made apparent in a MT though.  </s>
<s> In practice: literals are stored in a computer using some representation, together with a description of the "type" of literal so represented.  </s>
<s> So that gives us the potential problem, of course, as to determining which literal types (of a potentially open-ended collection) RDF implementations should support.  </s>
<s> I'd say that, at a bare minimum, unicode strings and langstrings ought to be understood.  </s>
<s> A nice next step might be (and I'm not suggesting we adopt this in the WG) the datatypes of XSD.  </s>
<s> Then RDF implementations could offer "best-effort" support for unrecognised literal types by recording the type indicator of the literal (as a URI?) together with its lexical representation, and offering a dumbed-down equality check.  </s>

<s> Forgive me answering this a week late (telecom italia problems last week), but this isn't as dire as you might think.  </s>
<s> The "platonic"/conceptual graphs are as distant from computer realisations as, say, the relational model is from your RDBMS of choice.  </s>
<s> You've _never_ inserted the number 12 into a relational table - except conceptually*.  </s>
