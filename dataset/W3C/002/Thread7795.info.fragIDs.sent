<s> Jim Amsden in his comments on the advanced collections spec said that he believes it is never possible to guarantee the integrity of bindings that cross servers.  </s>
<s> So requiring servers to guarantee the integrity of any binding that they allow to be created will have the result that no one will ever implement cross-server bindings.  </s>
<s> The kind of case he had in mind (I think) was one where the server where the resource resides becomes inaccessible to the server where bindings resides.  </s>
<s> So at least while the 2 servers are out of touch, the binding will be broken.  </s>
<s> We think that it is not impossible to guarantee integrity of bindings even in cases like this, if the server is willing to take enough trouble.  </s>
<s> It can  </s>
<s> store a copy of the target resource locally, and insure that no changes are  </s>
<s> allowed except when both servers are accessible.  </s>
<s> We agree that it is unlikely that cross-server bindings will be supported because of the difficulty of guaranteeing integrity, but we do want to insist the servers fail BIND requests where they can't guarantee integrity of the binding.  </s>
<s> (We are planning to remove all normative language about cross-server bindings, but just keep the generic statement that integrity of bindings has to be guaranteed.) If you don't care so much about integrity, and do want cross-server referencing, then redirect references are the better tool to use.  </s>

<s> I think until we do get that defined, server implementers are just going to have to experiment with their own ideas about dynamic (content) resources.  </s>
<s> As for COPY/MOVE'ing them.  </s>
<s> For now we'll just have to leave implementors with the guidelines that we have now.  </s>
<s> If they don't think they can support them (or anything else), then they need to reject requests that require they support them.  </s>
<s> They are going to need to make some judgement calls here.  </s>
<s> When we come back to dynamic resources, we can be more specific about what is expected.  </s>
<s> Actually, it's more than that.  </s>
<s> You're (apparently) presuming that the servers can come up with some way of making DELETE on the resource trigger a DELETE on the binding.  </s>
<s> But suppose the resource is just a file, and it gets deleted from outside the server?  </s>
<s> I am not aware of any OS where you can get notification when a file is deleted.  </s>
<s> In the single-server case, this is not a problem, because the server can check to make sure the resource still exists before doing anything to indicate that the binding exists.  </s>
<s> In the cross-server case...well, you could still do it, but it'd make things like PROPFIND expensive (if a collection contains 15 cross-server bindings, you've got to do 15 HTTP requests to make sure they're all still there).  </s>

<s> In which case (as in all other cases where it cannot guarantee BIND semantics) the server has to fail the BIND request.  </s>
