<s> I tried to write down the things I know about how to edit specs in a group.  </s>
<s> I figure that it is a bit different from most of the discussion on this list, but I don't have another idea about a good place to talk about it (suggestions welcome).  </s>
<s> It is also based on my experience, which is mostly with WAI specs, and it is very incomplete.  </s>
<s> But I would welcome comments (like "this is a useeful thing to write down", or "this is rubbish - we don't want to hear about it", or even suggestions to edit it...)

<s> The writeup seems quite specific to WAI, but I still think it's good to document such things.  </s>
<s> I agree with pretty much all of the general advice, except that on occasion I have inserted "candidate wording" into a spec (marking it as such) so that my group could see it in context.  </s>
<s> One thing we started doing in the Linking group during periods of high activity was to send out weekly drafts showing the decisions made the previous week, along with a "diff" version generated by a process that compares the old and new XML, and sets the diff attributes (which get used by the diffspec stylesheet to produce change bars).  </s>

<s> I'll add a bit more about ways of clarifying that next time I play with it, like "candidate wording" and why it is helpful to see things in context like that.  </s>
