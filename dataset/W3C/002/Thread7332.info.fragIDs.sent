<s> - Jim A Data Model and Operations for DAV Properties Version 0.1, June 16, 1997 1 Introduction 1.1 Introduction Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a resource.  </s>
<s> Properties are data about data.  </s>
<s> The term property is used within this proposal to disambiguate the concept from the overloaded terms "metadata" and "attribute".  </s>
<s> Properties are used within distributed authoring environments to provide for efficient discovery and management of resources.  </s>
<s> For example, a subject property allows for the indexing of all resources by their subject and an author property allows for the discovery of what authors have written which documents.  </s>
<s> As explored in the next section, properties have a long history, having proven themselves essential to the maintenance of large document repositories.  </s>
<s> 1.2 Existing Metadata Proposals Many current proposals contain some notion of a property.  </s>
<s> These include PICS [Miller et al., 1996], PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft [Maloney, 1996], Web Collections, XML [Bray, 1997], several proposals on representing relationships within HTML, digital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper on Web metadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].  </s>
<s> Some proposals come from a digital library perspective.  </s>
<s> These include the Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and the Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture for different metadata schemas.  </s>
<s> The literature includes many examples of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994], a bibliographic metadata format, RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995], a technical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst system, and the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata conference describe many community-specific metadata sets.  </s>
<s> Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK [Lagoze, 1996], noted that, "new metadata sets will develop as the networked infrastructure matures" and "different communities will propose, design, and be responsible for different types of metadata."  </s>
<s> These observations can be corroborated by noting that many community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and there is significant motivation for the development of new forms of metadata as many communities increasingly make their data available in digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist data location and cataloging.  </s>
<s> 1.3 Properties and HTTP Headers Properties already exist, to a certain extent, within HTTP through the use of message headers.  </s>
<s> However, in distributed authoring environments a relatively large number of properties are needed to fully describe the state of a resource and setting/returning them all through HTTP headers is inefficient.  </s>
<s> Thus a mechanism is needed which allows a principal to identify a set of properties in which the principal is interested and to then set or retrieve just those properties.  </s>
<s> 1.4 Why Another Draft?  </s>
<s> Given that this is the fourth major draft on metadata capabilities submitted to the WebDAV working group, a reasonable question to ask is, "Why another draft?"  </s>
<s> In short, the following limitations in "A Proposal for Web Metadata Operations" [WebDAV, 1997] led to the development of this new proposal: Poor Internationalization Support.  </s>
<s> While the simple name/value pairs in [WebDAV, 1997] do allow the value field to contain an arbitrary sequence of octets, there is no way to indicate their character encoding.  </s>
<s> No Typing Support.  </s>
<s> Similar to the internationalization support, there is no way to indicate the encoding of binary data in a value field in [WebDAV, 1997], for example, to indicate a sequence of octets should be viewed as an integer, or as a floating point number, Proliferation of Methods.  </s>
<s> Since [WebDAV, 1997] does not contain a naming mechanism that combines the name of the resource and the name of the property into a single name, the methods GETMETA, DELMETA, and ADDMETA are necessary to "glue" together the name of the resource and the name of the property.  </s>
<s> No Sub-Properties.  </s>
<s> In [WebDAV, 1997] there is no way to define a property which describes another property (i.e., data about properties), yet this facility is useful for refining the meaning of a property.  </s>
<s> One important use of sub-properties is to indicate their "liveness," whether the server is enforcing the syntax and semantics of the property.  </s>
<s> This draft introduces two main innovations: a tree data model for properties, and a property naming mechanism for combining the URI of a resource and the URI for a property type into a single URI which identifies an instance of that property on the resource.  </s>
<s> The tree data model provides support for sub-properties, which then afford typing support and internationalization support.  </s>
<s> The property naming mechanism allows existing HTTP/1.1 methods (GET, DELETE, PUT) to be used for operations on properties, thus reducing the number of new methods and helping to ensure the utility of methods as a mechanism for caching and security.  </s>
<s> 2 A Property Model for HTTP Resources 2.1 Overview A property consists of a name and a value.  </s>
<s> However it is often the case that a property may itself contain properties, such as a sub-property which specifies its parent property is read only.  </s>
<s> The combination of properties and sub-properties creates a tree.  </s>
<s> Resource Root Property Property Read Only (Some Value) Yes/No 2.2 Property Tree The properties defined on a resource create a tree structure, whose root node is called the root property.  </s>
<s> The property tree consists of two types of nodes, a property node and a value node.  </s>
<s> A property node may have any number of children, those children may in turn consist of any number and any combination of property and values nodes.  </s>
<s> The ordering of these children must be maintained.  </s>
<s> Value nodes do not have any children as they can not contain properties, only a value.  </s>
<s> Property nodes are named, value nodes are referred to via their parent.  </s>
<s> To conceptualize this property model, one builds the previously mentioned tree.  </s>
<s> Internal nodes are property nodes and leaf nodes are value nodes.  </s>
<s> 2.3 Multivalued Properties It is possible for the children of a property to contain several properties that have the same name.  </s>
<s> In order to prevent confusion among identically named siblings, the ordering of siblings MUST be maintained by the resource.  </s>
<s> Thus it is now possible to differentiate siblings through the use of an index.  </s>
<s> 2.4 Property Names A property name identifies both the syntax and semantics of the children of a property node.  </s>
<s> It is critical that property names do not collide, that is, two principals defining the same property name with two different meanings.  </s>
<s> The URI framework provides for a mechanism to prevent namespace collision and for varying degrees of administrative control.  </s>
<s> Rather than reinvent these desirable features, DAV properties make use of them by requiring that all DAV property names MUST be URIs.  </s>
<s> 2.5 Schemas A schema is a group of property names.  </s>
<s> A schema may also define relationships between properties.  </s>
<s> It is often useful to indicate support for a particular schema in a request or a response.  </s>
<s> Schema discovery is also useful for determining if a system supports a group of properties.  </s>
<s> A property does not necessarily contain sufficient information to identify any schemas it may be a member of.  </s>
<s> As with property names, schemas MUST use URIs as their names.  </s>
<s> 2.6 Property Morphing 2.6.1 Problem Definition Property definitions change in two ways, either a new property is added or the value is marked up with new information.  </s>
<s> An example of the first class of change will soon be upon us.  </s>
<s> The Digital Signature (DSIG) group at the W3C http://www.w3.org/Security/DSig/Overview.html is currently working on a mechanism for signing chunks of data and properties.  </s>
<s> A value that previously consisted of only a string will be turned into a property containing a signature property and the string value.  </s>
<s> What would an older client, written before DSIG, do?  </s>
<s> Where once it looked only for a string, now it finds a string and a property.  </s>
<s> An example of the second class of change, markup can turn unstructured data into structured data.  </s>
<s> For example, a string which once contained a name is instead turned into two properties, one indicating the personal name and the second indicating the family name.  </s>
<s> What would an older client, written before the marked up format, do?  </s>
<s> Where once the client looked only for a string, now it finds two properties.  </s>
<s> 2.6.2 Solution Requirements A mechanism must be provided so that a client can examine the children of a property and upon encountering unknown properties know to either ignore the unknown property or to ignore the markup and promote the property's children one level up the parse tree.  </s>
<s> 2.7 Visualizing a Property Tree Using XML While it is possible to visualize tree structures in many ways, for use by WebDAV, this specification defines a linear visualization of property trees using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) [Bray, 1997] suitable for transmission as part of an HTTP protocol stream.  </s>
<s> A sketch of an algorithm for creating an XML linearization of a property tree is given below.  </s>
<s> Begin by printing an " XML " element, if this is a standalone document.  </s>
<s> Next, perform a traversal of the property tree, collecting the set of all schemas used by all properties.  </s>
<s> Print one " XML:Namespace " ... " AS " XML  </s>
<s> entity pair for each schema in use, ensuring that unique tags are used in  </s>
<s> the " AS " XML entities.  </s>
<s> Save the mapping between schema names.  </s>
<s> Next, perform a preorder traversal of the tree.  </s>
<s> For each node, print its name as " "{unique schema tag}":"{property URI which is relative to the schema's URI}" ", then print its value, then print " / ".  </s>
<s> Note that the  </s>
<s> process is recursive for values which contain properties.  </s>
<s> Whitespace may be printed between XML entities for prettyprinting.  </s>
<s> Print a closing " / " (to close the " XML ") if the document is standalone.  </s>
<s> A detailed description of " XML:Namespace " and " AS " XML entities is given in Appendix 4. 3 Property Identifiers 3.1 Problem Definition The addition of properties to the HTTP object model result in the state of HTTP resources containing two separate areas, the body of the resource and the properties of the resource.  </s>
<s> A mechanism is needed to unambiguously refer to both.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Solution Requirement The mechanism used for referring to the resource directly must also be usable for referring to the resource's properties in such a manner that even non-DAV aware clients can retrieve DAV properties.  </s>
<s> 3.3 DAV URL Parameter To allow for the specification of property information in the context of an http scheme URL, a switch is needed.  </s>
<s> This switch indicates that the path segments following it specify a property location.  </s>
<s> To this end the "DAV" param is introduced for use with http scheme URLs.  </s>
<s> All path segments to the right of the DAV param MUST be formatted according to the XML Link standard, described in appendix 3, XML Linking.  </s>
<s> 3.4 Hierarchical Naming Properties on a resource are referred to as a hierarchy from the root property on down.  </s>
<s> Thus if a resource has an author property defined on its root property, which itself contains a family name property, then a hierarchy three levels deep is needed to refer directly to the family name property.  </s>
<s> Root Property - Author Property - Family Name Property The Root property is defined as "/".  </s>
<s> However both the author and family name properties are referred to using URIs.  </s>
<s> The XML Link standard provides a mechanism to refer to nested URIs.  </s>
<s> For example, the following properties are defined on To create a reference to the value "Mansai" one would perform the following steps.  </s>
<s> 1. Add the DAV parameter to the base URI, 2. Add "/" to refer to the root of the resource's property namespace, 3. Change the author attribute's name into parameter format by changing the "/" to "!" and encasing it in parenthesis.  </s>
<s> We must encase it in parenthesis in order to indicate that we have made the "/" to "!" translation.  </s>
<s> We make the translation in order to prevent confusion over where segments are and to make sure that relative URIs will continue to work.  </s>
<s> 4. Next we continue the path by adding the family name attribute.  </s>
<s> Because it does not include any "/" it does not require encoding.  </s>
<s> The process is now complete, the URL can be used in a GET or PATCH to retrieve or alter the value.  </s>
<s> See appendix 3 for more information.  </s>
<s> 3.5 Compatibility with legacy systems 3.5.1  </s>
<s> Problem Definition The HTTP parameter space is uncontrolled, thus someone may already be using a parameter with a value of "DAV" for some end other than the one described here.  </s>
<s> Thus a client sending a URI with a DAV param to a server may receive an unexpected or inappropriate response.  </s>
<s> 3.5.2  </s>
<s> Solution Requirement A mechanism is needed to prevent namespace collisions.  </s>
<s> 3.5.3  </s>
<s> Proposed Solution All DAV compliant servers MUST honor the DAV param type on http URLs.  </s>
<s> Thus if a client knows it is talking to a DAV server, it can safely send an http URL with the DAV param.  </s>
<s> The client may send the http URL with the DAV param extension to a server that is not know to be DAV compliant if the client uses PEP [Connolly, 1997] to prevent collisions.  </s>
<s> The proper PEP header is: DAVPEP = "PEP: {{map "DAV"}{strength must}}" Note that this header PEP header is not compliant with [Connolly, 1997] but the author has spoken with the authors of the PEP draft and they will be changing the format to make the example legal.  </s>
<s> 4 DAV Schema The DAV Schema is specified as http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/.  </s>
<s> This schema is used to indicate support for properties that can be defined on a resource and XML entities that can be returned in responses.  </s>
<s> 4.1 Properties 4.1.1  </s>
<s> Live Property Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/live  </s>
<s> Purpose: To indicate that the parent property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the resource on which it is recorded.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any property Values: None Description: This property is used exclusively in a response to indicate if the resource a property is recorded on is enforcing the syntax and semantics of the property.  </s>
<s> The absence of the Live property tells the client that the corresponding property does not have its syntax and semantics enforced by the resource on which it is recorded.  </s>
<s> 4.1.2  </s>
<s> ReadOnly Property Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/readonly  </s>
<s> Purpose: To indicate that the parent property can only be retrieved, not set through the property mechanism.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any property Values: None Description: This property is used to indicate that the parent property can only be retrieved, not set through the property mechanism.  </s>
<s> This property is not meant as an access control mechanism but rather to reflect the fact that the property is not designed to have its value set through the property mechanism.  </s>
<s> 5 Link Property 5.1 Problem Description A mechanism is needed to associate resources with other resources.  </s>
<s> These associations, also known as links, consist of three values, a type describing the nature of the association, the source of the link, and the destination of the link.  </s>
<s> In the case of annotation, the source and destination of a link may not be the resource upon which the link is recorded.  </s>
<s> 5.2 Solution Requirements The association mechanism must make use of the property mechanism in order to make the existence of the associations searchable.  </s>
<s> 5.3 Link Property Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link  </s>
<s> Purpose: To indicate the existence of a link associated with the parent property.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any property that needs to have a link associated with it.  </s>
<s> Values: Src 1*Dst Description: Link is used to provide the source and one or more destinations of the link.  </s>
<s> The parent property provides the type.  </s>
<s> Link is a multivalued property so multiple Links may be used together to indicate multiple links with the same type.  </s>
<s> 5.4 Src Property Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/src  </s>
<s> Purpose: To indicate the source of a link.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>

<s> Purpose: To indicate one or more destinations of a link Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link  </s>
<s> Values: URI 5.6 Example In this example the resource http://foo.bar/program has a source property defined on it which contains three links.  </s>
<s> Each link contains three properties, two of which, src and dst, are part of the DAV schema, defined in this document, and one which is defined by the schema which only implements the properties in the DAV spec will not know what the foocorp properties are and will ignore them, thus seeing the expected source and destination links.  </s>
<s> However an enhanced client may know about the foocorp properties and thus be able to present the user with additional information about the links.  </s>
<s> 6 Properties and Methods 6.1 DELETE The delete method, when used on a property, causes the property and its children to be removed.  </s>
<s> 6.2 GET A GET on a property returns the name of the property and its children.  </s>
<s> Accept types may be used to specify the format of the return value but all DAV compliant servers MUST at minimum support a return type of application/XML.  </s>
<s> If application/XML is used as the response format then it MUST include the http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> schema.  </s>
<s> 6.2.1 GetResult XML Entity Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/getresult  </s>
<s> Purpose: To contain the results of a GET request Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any, usually XML Values: An XML Entity Description: The GetResult XML Entity provides the context to inform the client that its contents are not just some XML entity, but an XML representation of the requested property.  </s>

<s> The message body controls the actual action taken by a PATCH.  </s>
<s> All DAV compliant servers are required to support the use of the application/XML content-type using the http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>
<s> schema in a PATCH method with a request-URI that points to a property.  </s>
<s> The changes in a http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>

<s> The Ref contains the name of the property to be created or overwritten, this URI in Ref MUST be a relative URI whose base is the request-URI.  </s>
<s> The PatchValue XML entity contains the value the new property is to have, this value can contain both property and value nodes.  </s>
<s> 6.3.4  </s>
<s> Remove XML Entity Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/remove  </s>
<s> Purpose: To remove the DAV property specified inside the Remove XML entity.  </s>

<s> Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/PropertyUpdate  </s>
<s> Values: XML:Ref Description: Remove orders that the property specified in Ref and its children removed.  </s>
<s> Ordering the removal of a property that does not exist is not an error.  </s>
<s> The URI in Ref MUST be a relative URI whose base is the request-URI.  </s>
<s> 6.3.5  </s>
<s> Insert XML Entity Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/insert  </s>

<s> 8.1 Syntax  </s>
<s> The application/XML content type contains an XML document.  </s>
<s> Its syntax is as defined below.  </s>
<s> XML = XMLStart *XMLEntity Close XMLStart = " " "XML" " " XMLEntity= Open *(XMLText | XMLEntity) Close Close = " / " | " ""/"Entity-Name Markup" " Open = " " Entity-Name Markup " " XMLText = An Octet Stream which uses XML encoding for " " and " " Entity-Name = [As-Tag ":"] Name As-Tag = 1*Alpha Name = (alpha | "_") *(alpha | digit | "." | "-" | "_" | other) Other = Other characters must be encoded Markup = SP "-" | "" 8.2 XML Entity An XML entity, as defined in the BNF, is an open tag with content followed by a close tag.  </s>
<s> In order to prevent confusion with the term entity as used in HTTP, the term XML entity will be used.  </s>
<s> The first XML entity of a XML document MUST be the XML XML entity.  </s>
<s> This XML entity tells the parser that it is dealing with an XML document.  </s>
<s> So long as this XML entity is present the parser can be sure that it can parse the document, even if XML has been extended.  </s>
<s> If XML is ever altered in a manner that is not backwards compatible with this specification then the content-type and the outer most XML entity MUST be changed.  </s>
<s> 8.3 Entity-Name All XML entity names must map to URIs.  </s>
<s> However due to historical restrictions on what characters may appear in an XML entity name, URIs cannot be expressed in an XML entity name.  </s>
<s> This issue is dealt with in more detail in section 10.  </s>
<s> Entity-Names without [AS] are relative URIs whose base is the enclosing Entity-Name.  </s>
<s> If the enclosing Entity-Name is XML then the Entity-Name MUST use an [AS].  </s>
<s> 8.4 Close The close production marks the end of a XML entity.  </s>
<s> 8.5 XML Encoding In different contexts certain characters are reserved, for example "/" can not be used in an XML entity name and " "/" " can not be used in a value.  </s>
<s> As such these values must be encoded as follows: Encoding = Decimal | Hex4 Decimal = "&amp;" Non-Zero *("0" | Non-Zero) Hex4 = "&amp;u-" 4(Hex) Non-Zero = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" Hex = "0" | Non-Zero | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" The numbers MUST map to the UTF8 character encodings.  </s>
<s> Please note that the "&amp;" character must always be encoded.  </s>
<s> 8.6 Markup Modifier The markup modifier, ("-", after the end of an XML entity) instructs the principal how to treat a XML entity with an unknown name.  </s>
<s> If the modifier is used and the XML entity is not recognized then the XML entity name MUST be stripped and the XML entity's contents promoted one level in the parse tree.  </s>
<s> If the modifier is not used and the XML entity name is unknown then the XML entity and its contents MUST be ignored.  </s>
<s> 8.7 XML Syntax Shorthand The following template is recommended for efficiently providing a description of an XML entity.  </s>
<s> Name: The name of the XML entity Purpose: A one line description of the XML entity's purpose.  </s>
<s> Schema: The schema, if any, that the XML entity belongs to Parent: XML entities that this XML entity may be a child of.  </s>
<s> Values: A description, usually a BNF, of the simple and compound values that the XML entity supports.  </s>
<s> Description: Further information.  </s>
<s> Example: An example of the XML entity's use.  </s>
<s> 9 Appendix 2 - Parameter Syntax for Content-Type Application/XML HTTP 1.1 provides for a mechanism to include a parameter with a content type.  </s>
<s> In order to prevent namespace collisions the parameters for application/XML must use the following syntax: Parameter = #( " URI " ["=" (token | Quoted-String)]) 9.1 Schema Content-Type Parameter Parameter = " http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/content-type/schema/  </s>
<s> The http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/content-type/schema/ URL is used as a parameter to an application/xml content type.  </s>
<s> The URL indicates that its value lists some subset of the schemas defined in NameSpace parameters within the enclosed document.  </s>
<s> The URI can also be used in requests to indicate schemas that should appear in the result.  </s>
<s> An example of the use of this parameter is to include it in an accept-type header on a request to indicate that the response should contain the specified namespace.  </s>
<s> Thus the client is able to inform the server of its support for a particular set of namespaces.  </s>
<s> The server is not required to return a result with the specified namespaces.  </s>
<s> 10 Appendix 3 - URI Path Encoding 10.1 Problem Definition A mechanism is needed to refer to specific DAV properties in a manner that can handle simple, composite, and multivalued DAV properties.  </s>
<s> 10.2 Solution Requirement The reference mechanism must use the standard URL syntax so it can be used with both currently existing and future URLs.  </s>
<s> For example, the syntax could be appended to an HTTP URL to specify a HTTP property on that URL. 10.3 Path Component URIPath = "/" [path-segments] Path-segments = segment *("/" segment) Segment = ("(" Abs-URI ")" | Rel-URI)[Index]*(";" param) Index = ["(" ["-"]*digit ")"] Abs-URI =  An absolute or relative URI which has been URI-Path encoded Rel-URI =  A relative URI for which URI-Encoding(Rel-URI) == Rel-URI URI-Path encoding consists of the following algorithm: 1. URL encode all "!" characters 2. Map all "/" characters to "!" characters Please note that all relative URIs are relative to the URI in the path segment preceding them.  </s>
<s> Hence the URI in the first path segment MUST be an absolute URI.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the encoding is to allow URLs to be used as segments without having to use % encoding on all the "/" which produces a URL form which is extremely difficult for humans to deal with, and which changes the semantics of the URL.  </s>
<s> 10.4 Composite DAV Properties The DAV property namespace is hierarchical, allowing DAV properties to be nested within each other.  </s>
<s> In order to refer to a particular DAV property one must list all the DAV properties from the root to the desired DAV property.  </s>
<s> For example, using XML notation for illustrative purposes, Using the path specification one would refer to the PersonalName DAV property as "/(http:!!www.aiim.org!standards!dublin!author)/Name/(http:!!www.ansi.org!standards!z39.50!PersonalName)".  </s>
<s> Name does not have to be encased in parenthesis because it meets the rel-uri rule.  </s>
<s> 10.5 Multivalued DAV Properties A DAV property may often have several siblings, for example, the resource "A" has the following DAV properties defined on it, again using XML notation for illustrative purposes, An index system is used to distinguish siblings with the same name.  </s>
<s> The index indicates the relative positions of multivalued sibling DAV properties to each other.  </s>
<s> The first sibling is at position 1 and the rest are at position N+1 where N is the position of the previous sibling.  </s>
<s> Negative position numbers may also be use such that -1 refers to the last sibling and the index is decremented for each subsequent sibling.  </s>
<s> In cases where a multivalued DAV properties exists but no index is provided, the index value will default to 1. Thus the parameters in the example would be referred to as follows: Parameter Negative Value Positive Index Index /A:b or /A:b(1) c e / /A:b/c or /A:b/c(-2) /A:b/c(1) d f / /A:b/d or /A:b/d(-2) /A:b/d(1) c g / /A:b/c(2) /A:b/c(-1) d h / /A:b/d(2) /A:b/d(-1) 11 Appendix 4 - XML URI The "XML" scheme is to be registered with IANA as a reserved namespace that will be owned by the XML group through the W3C.  </s>
<s> The new URI is defined as: XML = "XML" ":" XML-Path 12 Appendix 5 - XML Entities 12.1 Ref XML entity Name: XML:Ref Purpose: A XML entity that indicates that its contents are a URI.  </s>
<s> Schema: XML Parent: Any Value: URI 12.2 Namespace 12.2.1 Namespace XML entity Name: XML:Namespace Purpose: To inform the parser that a particular schema is in use and to provide a shorthand name for referring to XML entities related to that schema.  </s>
<s> Schema: XML Parent: Any Value: (Ref [AS]) Description: This XML entity contains two XML entities, Ref and AS.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the XML entity is to inform the parser that a schema, identified by the value of the Ref XML entity, is in use and, when appropriate, to provide a shorthand name to refer XML entities derived from that schema using the AS XML entity.  </s>
<s> The AS mechanism is needed for efficiency reasons and because a URI can not be fully specified in an XML open tag.  </s>
<s> The Namespace XML entity's scope is all siblings and their children.  </s>
<s> 12.2.2 AS XML entity Name: XML:AS Purpose: To provide a short name for the URI of the schema provided in the Ref XML entity of a namespace XML entity.  </s>
<s> Schema: XML Parent: XML:Namespace Value: 1*Alpha Description: The AS XML entity is used to provide a shorthand reference for the URI in the Ref XML entity of a Namespace XML entity.  </s>
<s> The value contained in the AS XML entity is generated at the XML producer's discretion, the only requirement is that all AS values MUST be unique within the contents of the parent of the namespace element.  </s>
<s> All XML entity open tags contain a name of the form As-Tag:Name.  </s>
<s> The As-Tag is the value defined in an AS XML entity inside of a Namespace.  </s>
<s> To resolve the As-Tag:Name into a properly formatted URI replace "As-Tag:" with the URI provided in the Ref that the AS was defined with.  </s>
<s> Also note that AS value also applies to any URIs defined in a Ref inside of Namespace.  </s>
<s> For example, So B:(B:) translates to http://blah;DAV/(http:!!blah;DAV!)/ and C:Moo translates to http://blah;DAV/(http:!!blah;DAV!)/Moo.  </s>
<s> 12.2.3 Required XML entity Name: XML:Required Purpose: To indicate that the read MUST understand the associated Namespace in order to successfully process the XML document.  </s>
<s> Schema: XML Parent: XML:Namespace Value: None 12.2.4 The XML URI and Namespace In order to prevent a logical loop the XML namespace is said to be declared, with the AS value of "XML" as a consequence of the XML enclosing property.  </s>
<s> This is interesting but needs some XML work.  </s>
<s> On quick perusal:  </s>
<s> Extensible, not Extended.  </s>
<s> You really want a Document Type Definition for what you're doing here, even though XML allows documents that don't have a DTD.  </s>
<s> In any event, XML is not a particularly good name for the root element; the XML folks are likely to preempt it.  </s>
<s> How about WEBDAVTREE, etc.  </s>
<s> Despite the fact that the MCF spec uses element type names that include colons, my testing (with James Clark's JADE 0.7) and my reading of the spec suggest that the colon is not a valid character here.  </s>
<s> However, the spec is fluid, and you should ask for advice on this score, e.g., by posting to the XML-DEV list.  </s>
<s> I am not sure that "XML entity pair" means anything.  </s>
<s> I think you mean "two start-tags".  </s>
<s> / is not in XML; you need to use a full end-tag, e.g., WEBDAVTREE.Namespace ... /WEBDAVTREE.Namespace .  </s>
<s> Again, you need the full end-tag.  </s>
<s> should be What does the "Z" mean?  </s>
<s> Namespace Ref AIIM:Dublin: / AS D / Z:Author D:PersonalName Shirley / D:FamilyName Mansai / / /  </s>
<s> I see.  </s>
<s> You are trying to write a DTD on the fly.  </s>
<s> There is no way of validating this structure, of knowing that you have constructed it correctly.  </s>
<s> Arbitrary extensibility of syntax is nice, but so is validatability.  </s>
<s> Why not construct !doctype webdavtree.mine  </s>
<s> [ ] ?  </s>
<s> Then you can parse with a validating XML parser to see that your element definition structure and document body are correctly constructed.  </s>
<s> Further, "AIIM:Dublin" can be a URL or URN.  </s>
<s> If FamilyName is in the AIIM:Dublin spec, why not just assign a normal URL (or URN) to that semantic, exactly as you do below?  </s>
<s> It would require the cooperation of the spec maintainers, but that would be a real good thing for interoperability.  </s>
<s> If you don't include a version number in that URL you *will* regret it.  </s>
<s> Very nice; this is the right approach.  </s>
<s> This info could be marked up according to an XML DTD too.  </s>
<s> You might want to synch this up with XML-link, once it's frozen.  </s>
<s> (Or again, not, depending on how it turns out.)  </s>
<s> This really ought to be an XML DTD unless there are technical reasons it can't be.  </s>
<s> XML-lang has the EBNF in it already; there's nothing to be gained by reinventing it here.  </s>
