Dear all I find a problem with Tidy. 
Each time when I use Tidy to clean up the codes of my document, save the document and open it again, I find there are lots of "?" characters. 
I have had a hard time in locating the problem, only to find that this is because Tidy converts all '&amp;nbsp;' into '?'. 
If a '&amp;nbsp' is adjacent to a tag, Tidy will also trim the tag. 
So I find lots of ?br or ?p . 
I have a lots of web-pages needing to be cleaned, and these pages were previously created by an old version of netscape composer, which added many '&amp;nbsp;' in these documents. 
However, since the above problem exists, I must clear up all the "?" after tidy cleans the codes. 
This is rather inconvienence. 
The following is my configuaration file for Tidy tidy-mark: yes markup: yes wrap: 72 tab-size: 8 indent: auto indent-spaces: 2 output-xhtml: no doctype: loose char-encoding: raw clean: no logical-emphasis: yes keep-time: yes quote-nbsp: yes I use the raw option because my documents contain Asian characters. 
I have tried to change the option for quote-nbsp to 'no' but in vain. 
I use the win32 version of Tidy which is supposed to support Asian characters (although this command line program is itself unsupported now, its version date was Sept, 2001). 
Can anyone suggest how I should go on? 
Thank you very much for any reply.

p.s. it is very hard to find a good html editor that is integrated with Tidy and support Asian characters well :-( . 
I can hardly find one running either on GNU/Linux or Windoze. 
I really hope that I can enjoy the full power of Tidy, Amaya and even the validation service of W3C (which keeps on telling me that 'your page contains bytes which I cannot interpret as big5', when this page can be rendered unproblematically in all browsers I test again, including lynx.) 
F Dear all F I find a problem with Tidy. 
Each time when I use Tidy to clean up the F codes of my document, save the document and open it again, I find there F are lots of "?" characters. 
I have had a hard time in locating the F problem, only to find that this is because Tidy converts all '&amp;nbsp;' F into '?'. 
If a '&amp;nbsp' is adjacent to a tag, Tidy will also trim the F tag. 
So I find lots of ?br or ?p . 
yes, it puts a octal 240 = 0xA0 into the file which then combines with neighboring characters to be seen as an invalid chinese character... i want to make sure tidy won't put any 0xA0...0xFF into my files on its own. 
see my message regarding "240" in the archives. 
char-encoding: raw = this is your problem. 
Raw encoding is the tidy equivalent of "garbage in, garbage out". 
When parsing, tidy converts everything (including named entities such as &amp;nbsp;) into utf-8; once the DOM is constructed and cleaned, it outputs everything in the requested encoding. 
Raw output doesn't create any entities (phrases beginning with &amp; and ending with ;); since you have requested raw, it coverts the non-breaking space (stored internally in utf8) to it's numeric value, 160. 
I don't know why you need to use raw encoding for asian character sets, but I really don't need to know because tidy has the option of specifying different input and output encodings. 
Thus, if you specify: input-encoding: raw output-encoding: utf8 your input will be read just as it is now, but the output will be valid utf-8. 
If you wanted unicode output you could use: output-encoding: iso2022 If your version of tidy was built with support for asian encodings you should also be able to use: output-encoding: shiftjis or for the chinese big 5 character set: output-encoding: big5 Other relevant output encodings include ASCII (to limit the output to 7-bit values), mac (to convert to the McIntosh Roman character set), win1252 (which uses otherwise invalid values in the 128-159 range), and latin-1 (probably the most common). 
With any of these encodings, characters which cannot be represented in the requested output character set are converted to entities. 
I hope this helps. 
Lee output-encoding: big5 does this work in the dec01 asian version? 
not for me. 
anyway, we use -raw because we must make big5 web pages... it is not unicode time yet here. 
Also, I have some web pages that are pure ascii. 
With -raw I don't have to change the tidy switches for each file depending on its coding system. 
Anyway, I still use aug00 tidy because you haven't put back the #FFFFFF color stuff.
