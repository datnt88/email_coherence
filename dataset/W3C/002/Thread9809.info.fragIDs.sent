<s> I'm agnostic about the particular representation, but I think it is important that we have a single canonical representation for literals in NTriples, and that it is extensible (should we decide we need something more in literal structures).  </s>
<s> It could be (0,"35",en) 0-"35"-en whatever But preferably not either "35"-en or xml(" b foo /b ",en)  </s>
<s> That's all, Patrick  </s>
<s> We decided we don't need something more.  </s>
<s> RDF 1.0 syntax isn't extensible; hence n-triples need not be.  </s>
<s> Please don't make n-triples out to be more than it is.  </s>
<s> I accept that as your preference.  </s>
<s> But both syntaxes are equally "canonical"; i.e. each corresponds 1-1 with what we want to say.  </s>
<s> And we have a lot invested in the "24" syntax (a hundred or so test cases).  </s>
<s> I don't see any reason to throw it away.  </s>
