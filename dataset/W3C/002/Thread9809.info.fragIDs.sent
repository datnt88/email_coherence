I'm agnostic about the particular representation, but I think it is important that we have a single canonical representation for literals in NTriples, and that it is extensible (should we decide we need something more in literal structures). 
It could be (0,"35",en) 0-"35"-en whatever But preferably not either "35"-en or xml(" b foo /b ",en) 
That's all, Patrick 
We decided we don't need something more. 
RDF 1.0 syntax isn't extensible; hence n-triples need not be. 
Please don't make n-triples out to be more than it is. 
I accept that as your preference. 
But both syntaxes are equally "canonical"; i.e. each corresponds 1-1 with what we want to say. 
And we have a lot invested in the "24" syntax (a hundred or so test cases). 
I don't see any reason to throw it away.

Strong agreement.
