<s> I would just like to comment that I remember that even with all the bells and whistles turned on, I remember that I still couldn't get tidy to turn the usual mircosoft html mess document into a html strict 4.01 with _no stylesheet_ and all the font stuff somehow rationalized into em , strong etc.  </s>
