Hi all, I am not sure about the encoding of the text content for the X509SKI element. 
Is it: - base64 encoded or plain? 
- the DER encoded value of the X509 SubjectKeyIdentifier extension or the plain value of this extension?

Hi, My interpretation is the base 64 encoded (crypto binary) plain value (i.e., without any DER octet string prefix), given our general tendency to avoid ASN.1 wrapping where possible.

Hi all, Are there any other feelings about the encoding of the X509SKI element? 
I agree with merlin that we should try to avoid the ASN.1 wrapping, as we have done with the PKCS1 signature content. 
Therefore I suggest to replace the explanatory text for the X509SKI element in section 4.4.4 (numbered list, item 3) with the following: 3. The X509SKI element, which contains the base64 encoded plain (i.e. non-DER-encoded) value of a X509 V.3 SubjectKeyIdentifier extension.

Barring other comments, I'll include this text and make the type cryptobinary.

The text is good, but X509SKI is already cryptobinary; you've just changed subject name (which is rfc 2253 string).

Oops, sorry. 
The proper text and schema should be at: Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org
