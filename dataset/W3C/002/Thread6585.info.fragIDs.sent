Hello, Please look at this: 
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Becomes a W3C Recommendation 5 September 2001 
Refactoring RDF/XML Syntax Working Draft Published 6 September 2001 SMIL Animation Becomes a W3C Recommendation 5 September 2001 
These are the news from http://www.w3.org . 
I though the news are counted from bottom to top, but now I don't know what's happening. 
Why there is Sep5 then Sep6 and then Sep5 again? 
Regards, Alexander. 
The headline in red is the top story, the most important one at the time of publication. 
After that top item, everything should be in reverse chronological order with the most recent first. 
I agree this can be confusing, and will mention it if we redesign.

Hello Susan, SL The headline in red is the top story, the most important one at the SL time of publication. 
After that top item, everything should be in SL reverse chronological order with the most recent first. 
SL I agree this can be confusing, and will mention it if we redesign. 
SL Best wishes, 
And why not preserve the hronological order, while mark the most important in red? 
For e. g., for today 'Refactoring RDF/XML Syntax Working Draft Published' will be at the top but in black and 'Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Becomes a W3C Recommendation' will be a bit lower, while marked in red (which will show its importance). 
Regards, Alexander. 
Thank you for the suggestion. 
Accessibility guidelines [1] ask that one not use color alone to distinguish items. 
As it stands, the top story is distinguished in two ways: position and color. 
Other means, like labels, 'hr' elements, font size, and so on might accomplish this. 
In any case, I think that given our current design the top story has to be first and be legible without scrolling.
