Hi, is there away to tell Jtidy NOT to convert attribute names to lower case? 
Can you PLEEEEASE respond to mahendra.singh@gs.com..as i cannot subscribe to 
this group from my work...they are filtered out. 
thanks much 
Mahendra -- Sorry I didn't reply sooner. 
Checking the documentation page (http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/), it looks like including the configuration file property uppercase-attributes: yes 
will result in outputting all of the attributes in upper case. 
To preserve the existing case, it looks like you'll have to output your 
results as XHTML or XML. 
HTH, Gary 
thankyou for the response. 
I have tried both setXmlOut and setXHTML and niether preserves the case. 
in case you are wondering...the reason i need to do this is becasue i have a dom object model that can consists of both proprietary elements as well as all of the html elements. 
basically we have created an html editor and use jTidy to clean up the html elements and make them well formed, and then simply insert this into our DOM object. 
it works great except that that jtidy converts everthing to lowercase and so their are inconsistencies all over. 
it is also a problem when trying to manipulate the DOM in code..as case matters. 
i have been using the java naming standards in naming my elements and attributes. 
Elements (analygous to Objects), start with Uppercase and every other word in the element name is an Upper case character. 
Attributes (analygous to properties or methods) start with lowercase and every other word in the attribute name is in upper case. 
thanks again..and if you can..please respond by email also...don't have access to mailing list..they are filtered out.

Hmmm. I'll have to check it out. 
The documentation indicates otherwise, I think.
