<s> Is there a suite of test cases for URis, covering basic syntax, finding relative forms, finding absolute forms, etc.?  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Good question.  </s>
<s> I keep a set of test cases in  </s>
<s> it includes the set in the appendix of Note things like... (base, '../../../g', 'http://a/g'), #@@disagree with RFC2396 (base, '../../../../g', 'http://a/g'), #@@disagree with RFC2396 I should probably check those against Roy's issues list.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Maybe a couple of others to consider?: "http://example/x/y%2Fz" "http://example/x/abc" "abc" "http://example/x/y/z" "http://example/x%2Fabc" "../../x%2Fabc" "http://example/x/y%2Fz" "http://example/x%2Fabc" "../x%2Fabc" "http://example/x%2Fy/z" "http://example/x%2Fy/abc" "abc"  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> OK, I added these, after a tweak... TimBL prefers root-relative paths, i.e. "/x%2Fabc" to "../../x%2Fabc" Both are correct relative paths from here to there, but our code currently does "/x%2Fabc".  </s>
<s> I don't really like it; it doesn't support moving filesets around as well as it could.  </s>
<s> But I haven't convinced timbl, nor have I completely debugged an algorithm for returning "../../x%2Fabc".  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I've got both in my test suite for now.  </s>
<s> I'll sort out which to keep later.  </s>
<s> How does this square with these cases?: ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/ex/x/r', '../r'), ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/r', '/r'), # I prefer this.  </s>
<s> - tbl If using a root-relative path, wouldn't the first be: ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/ex/x/r', '/ex/x/r'), ?  </s>
<s> (Maybe that's what the "I prefer" case aims to show?) #g Graham Klyne  </s>
