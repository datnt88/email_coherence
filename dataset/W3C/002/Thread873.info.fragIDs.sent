Hi Is there a way to suppress the extra Carriage return after and end tag? 
I.e.. Instead of To pretty-print This would make my XML files more readable I find. 
Thanks for a great tool though!

Hi everyone, Alex I downloaded the latest tidy.exe for Windows and it was doing just that, removing all CR after end tags... so you may want to try it... But i was wondering how to turn that back on? 
I don't mind the extra space when editing large xhtml files... 
Any ideas?

There are three settings for --indent: yes, no and auto. 
For yes and no, Tidy does not print any empty lines. 
For auto, it still prints an empty line between many block elements, but not as many as it used to. 
We complaints no matter what we do ... grin . 
-i is equivalent to --ident yes See http://tidy.sf.net/docs/quickref.html#indent 
take it easy, Charlie 
Hey Charles, I'm sure you hear allot of complaining, always remember, this program kicks some serious ass and I use it everyday. 
It's fantastic... 
I think I'm the only developer who doesn't like indenting.. G 
So: indent:auto indent-spaces:0 indent-attributes:no Works well, no indenting and still have the empty lines, perfect... 
One question tho, when new version of tidy are built, is there ever an announcement that new entries in the config file are needed? 
Such as indent-attributes, hadn't seen that one before... Jason E.J. Manaigre International Institute for Sustainable Development

Hi Jason, 
Kind of you to say. 
Of course, complainers play a vital role. 
How else would anything happen in software? 
I think there are many like yourself, so this is helpful. 
Btw, indent-attributes is off by default. 
I am getting the message from various folks that the Tidy development team needs to do a better job of communicating with the user community. 
A change log would be a good start. 
Does anyone know of a script to build such a thing from CVS logs? 
We could also use some release engineering assistance. 
take it easy, Charlie
