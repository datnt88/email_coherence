<s> Hi Is there a way to suppress the extra Carriage return after and end tag?  </s>
<s> I.e.. Instead of To pretty-print This would make my XML files more readable I find.  </s>

<s> Hi everyone, Alex I downloaded the latest tidy.exe for Windows and it was doing just that, removing all CR after end tags... so you may want to try it... But i was wondering how to turn that back on?  </s>
<s> I don't mind the extra space when editing large xhtml files...  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>

<s> There are three settings for --indent: yes, no and auto.  </s>
<s> For yes and no, Tidy does not print any empty lines.  </s>
<s> For auto, it still prints an empty line between many block elements, but not as many as it used to.  </s>
<s> We complaints no matter what we do ... grin .  </s>
<s> -i is equivalent to --ident yes See http://tidy.sf.net/docs/quickref.html#indent  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> Hey Charles, I'm sure you hear allot of complaining, always remember, this program kicks some serious ass and I use it everyday.  </s>
<s> It's fantastic...  </s>
<s> I think I'm the only developer who doesn't like indenting.. G  </s>
<s> So: indent:auto indent-spaces:0 indent-attributes:no Works well, no indenting and still have the empty lines, perfect...  </s>
<s> One question tho, when new version of tidy are built, is there ever an announcement that new entries in the config file are needed?  </s>
<s> Such as indent-attributes, hadn't seen that one before... Jason E.J. Manaigre International Institute for Sustainable Development  </s>

<s> Hi Jason,  </s>
<s> Kind of you to say.  </s>
<s> Of course, complainers play a vital role.  </s>
<s> How else would anything happen in software?  </s>
<s> I think there are many like yourself, so this is helpful.  </s>
<s> Btw, indent-attributes is off by default.  </s>
<s> I am getting the message from various folks that the Tidy development team needs to do a better job of communicating with the user community.  </s>
<s> A change log would be a good start.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a script to build such a thing from CVS logs?  </s>
<s> We could also use some release engineering assistance.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
