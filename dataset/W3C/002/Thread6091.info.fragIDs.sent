Just one stupid question: Suppose I have exposed my applicaton as a web service. 
Of course, I am interested in using it by clients to have some profits, etc., Do I have to implement choreography interfaces or should someone else do so? 
Suppose that the interfaces were chanaged or new one were published. 
Do I have to care about it and implement the new ones? 
Best regards, Stanislaw 
I think it should be possible for someone else to implement the client-side choreography interfaces. 
It should also be possible to some one else to implement the provider-side interfaces and readily interoperate with the clients. 
IMO, these possibilities mainly define what interoperability means for our working group. 
I have put together a picture to show the high level steps an application provider would take to define and publish the application choreography to its clients. 
See attached. 
The step 2 in the picture (binding processes) should allow binding the choreography interfaces to existing applications or developing new applications from scratch, on both provider and client side. 
Obviously the ideas in the picture are based upon my understanding of the problem we are trying to solve and I could be wrong. 
Any criticism/feedback is welcome.

This looks very promising. 
If I understood this and the picture correctly, it is possible that the implementation of client-side and provider-side choreography interfaces may serve as a middleware between client and provider. 
Provider registers its application as a service to the middleware, actually, to the component that implements the provider-side choreography interface. 
In this case the component may serve for other applications providing service of the same type. 
This may be of particular interest because of failure of a single application. 
Client sends requests (tasks) to the middleware, actually, to the component implementing client-side choreography interface. 
It is clear that this component may serve for other clients as well. 
It looks nice at least IMO. 
However, IMHO there is a problem with interoperability if there is no uniform way (language) to express service types and clients' requests. 
I could be wrong. 
Any criticism is welcome.
