<s> Just one stupid question: Suppose I have exposed my applicaton as a web service.  </s>
<s> Of course, I am interested in using it by clients to have some profits, etc., Do I have to implement choreography interfaces or should someone else do so?  </s>

<s> I think it should be possible for someone else to implement the client-side choreography interfaces.  </s>
<s> It should also be possible to some one else to implement the provider-side interfaces and readily interoperate with the clients.  </s>
<s> IMO, these possibilities mainly define what interoperability means for our working group.  </s>
<s> I have put together a picture to show the high level steps an application provider would take to define and publish the application choreography to its clients.  </s>
<s> See attached.  </s>
<s> The step 2 in the picture (binding processes) should allow binding the choreography interfaces to existing applications or developing new applications from scratch, on both provider and client side.  </s>
<s> Obviously the ideas in the picture are based upon my understanding of the problem we are trying to solve and I could be wrong.  </s>

<s> This looks very promising.  </s>
<s> If I understood this and the picture correctly, it is possible that the implementation of client-side and provider-side choreography interfaces may serve as a middleware between client and provider.  </s>
<s> Provider registers its application as a service to the middleware, actually, to the component that implements the provider-side choreography interface.  </s>
<s> In this case the component may serve for other applications providing service of the same type.  </s>
<s> This may be of particular interest because of failure of a single application.  </s>
<s> Client sends requests (tasks) to the middleware, actually, to the component implementing client-side choreography interface.  </s>
<s> It is clear that this component may serve for other clients as well.  </s>
<s> It looks nice at least IMO.  </s>
<s> However, IMHO there is a problem with interoperability if there is no uniform way (language) to express service types and clients' requests.  </s>
