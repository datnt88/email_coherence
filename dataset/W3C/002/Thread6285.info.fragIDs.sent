<s> Folks, As per my action from June 16th call: Attributes Requirements to Support OGSI Service Data The perspective of this list of requirements can be described as an answer to the following question, "What must facilities Attributes support in order to support (directly or indirectly) the abstract functions of OGSI Service Data?" Handy if the access mechanisms can be reused in other than direct access context, e.g. notification.  </s>
<s> Do we need predefined attributes?  </s>
<s> Probably yes.  </s>
<s> Do we need query across multiple attributes in one service?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Ability to restrict access on a per attribute basis.  </s>
<s> Do we need the ability to restrict read vs. write access (by user)?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Do we need the ability to restrict read vs. write access (structural)?  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Need some predefined attributes Ability to know (partial?) list of attributes at design time - yes Ability to know type of attributes ahead of time - yes (but may be out of bands (xsi types).  </s>
<s> Input/output messages that manipulate attributes can be validated against WSDL Support for static attributes - yes Opaque or abstract type xsi type.  </s>
<s> - yes but I don't fully understand the differences here.. Attributes can be inherited through WSDL 1.2 inheritance - yes Support metadata on attributes (creation date, type, description...) - yes we need the mechanism.  </s>
<s> Allow bulk retrieval of several attributes in one operation - yes.  </s>
<s> Attributes can be of any schema type (simple or complex) - yes  </s>

<s> Folks, Sorry, this was OBVIOUSLY in draft form.  </s>
<s> I was working on it when some fool (me) pressed the "send all pending" button.  </s>
<s> There will be a better version later.  </s>

<s> Folks, As per my action from June 16th call.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the premature posting earlier this week.  </s>
<s> I hope this mail makes more sense.  </s>
<s> BTW: I won't be on the call Monday (flying to GGF).  </s>
<s> Attributes Requirements to Support OGSI Service Data The perspective of this list of requirements can be described as an answer to the following question, "What facilities must Attributes have in order to support (directly or indirectly) the abstract functions of OGSI Service Data?" Highly Desirable: Whatever the state access mechanisms are, it would be useful if they can be reused in other contexts, e.g. notification.  </s>
<s> The OGSI Service Data model is reused for the notification framework.  </s>
<s> We can think of "subscribe to SDE foo" as a push form of "find SDE foo", i.e. a pull model.  </s>
<s> Required: We need predefined attributes.  </s>
<s> We need to be able to declare certain attributes that can be relied on in any GS portType.  </s>
<s> There need not be any defined attributes in the WSDL spec.  </s>
<s> The "ServiceDataNames" SDE contains a list of all available SDEs.  </s>
<s> One could argue that this needed to be provided as part of the WSL level attribute model.  </s>
<s> I don't believe this is necessary.  </s>
<s> As long as we can declare ServiceDataNames in the WSDL and allow it to be extendable, we can do what we need to do.  </s>
<s> Required: We need to query across multiple attributes in one service.  </s>
<s> The OGSI findByServiceDataNames query type to findServiceData gets multiple values.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that this MUST be expressed in the WSDL (i.e. as operations in WSDL).  </s>
<s> Our GridService portType can define this.  </s>
<s> The concern here is one we have been discussing: "is the notion of access to declared state domain specific or more general."  </s>
<s> I believe that is is quite general, but GridServices can manage with an application domain specifi solution, i.e. in the GS portType.  </s>
<s> Required: Ability to restrict access on a per attribute basis.  </s>
<s> However, as in the discussions on the call, OGSI puts this outside our scope at this stage.  </s>
<s> It may mean that in time, we need to annotate SD with access information (depending on how security is implemented).  </s>
<s> The issue of visibility of this information is also an issue.  </s>
<s> Some services may not want the client to know that they cannot access the information or even tat it exists.  </s>
<s> Required: We need the ability to restrict read vs. write access by the client over the service interface.  </s>
<s> SD uses the modifiable attribute for this.  </s>
<s> Required: We need the ability to restrict read vs. write access based on the structure of the value.  </s>
<s> In particular, we define four models: static - WSDL defined and unchanging; constant - instance defined and unchanging; extendable - can be added to only; and mutable - all changes are possible.  </s>
<s> Examples on request.  </s>
<s> Required: We need the ability to know a (partial) list of attributes at design time.  </s>
<s> This is needed for the boot strapping process as well as defining the architecture - "All Grid Services have these attributes."  </s>
<s> Required: We ability to know type (some) of attributes ahead of time.  </s>
<s> However, the dynamic nature of the grid envisions cases where a service might have service data types that a client has never seen before.  </s>
<s> Tools to interpret these dynamically are planned, but also service data forwarding agents migh not need to understand the SD in order to perform their functions.  </s>
<s> Highly desirable: The service data model makes a distinction between a SDE that is absent from one that is present but has the value nil.  </s>
<s> We have this distinction at present, but there was much debate in this area and other approaches to meeting the requirements might also be possible, e.g. clever use on minOccurs.  </s>
<s> Required: Input/output messages that manipulate attributes need to be validated against WSDL.  </s>
<s> This is required, but can be defined in the OGSI portTypes.  </s>
<s> Highly desirable: If it turns out that W3C defines a standard mechanism the access attributes, we would like to use these directly.  </s>
<s> In this case, we would want flexible read and write access.  </s>
<s> For example, implicit get/set operations based on attribute name would not be sufficient.  </s>
<s> We need multiple attribute access and cross attribute query processing.  </s>
<s> We assume at the present that the query format is domain specific.  </s>
<s> Required: Some attributes may occur multiple times.  </s>
<s> E.g. the serviceDataName SDE is a single service data name attribute that can occur multiple times rather than a single multi-valued attribute.  </s>
<s> Required: There is a need for handling opaque or abstract types.  </s>
<s> the ExtensibilityType is a place to put data value that carry their type with them (xsi:type or the like - but I don't fully understand this).  </s>
<s> By the way, this is an area that has caused me some headaches on the implementation side.  </s>
<s> Required: Attributes can be inherited through WSDL 1.2 inheritance.  </s>
<s> Types and values appearing in a parent portType will appear in the child.  </s>
<s> At present static values are accumulated though the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> There are some other issues that we resolved in this area in what might be called arbitrary ways, such as conflicts between inheriting values and complying with max/minOccurs.  </s>
<s> I believe we could adapt to changes in this space as long as they are addressed clearly.  </s>
<s> Required: Support metadata on attributes (creation date, type, description...).  </s>
<s> OGSI has quite a rich framework that might be considered application domain specific.  </s>
<s> That these attributes are listed as required by all attributes or if the attributes are extensible really does not matter.  </s>
<s> [There is a bit here that confuses me - attributes on attributes?  </s>
<s> Is this really possible?]  </s>
<s> Required: Attributes need to be of any schema type (simple or complex).  </s>
<s> Some of our structures are quite complex.  </s>
<s> There are two meta comments I would like to make: 1) A summary requirement is: we need to ensure that our GridService portType can be built on top of the new WS state model.  </s>
<s> This minimal set of requirements is probably quite small.  </s>
<s> We have the GridService portType on which to put most of our mechanisms.  </s>
<s> 2) We believe that the content and facilities represented by the full GridSrvice portType (and the rest of OGSI) are quite valuable and we would like to see them receive wider exposure.  </s>
<s> The extent to which this task force can promote these ideas within W3C may be somewhat limited.  </s>
<s> We realise this and will not push you to overextend your remit.  </s>
