Hi, I have been looking at jTidy for the last couple of days and notice there is a serious lack of activity there by anyone associated with the project (sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy). 
Does anyone here happen to know if jTidy is still being worked on? 
If so do you know if they are working on a port from tidyLib or from classic tidy? 
The java version of the library would be great to have as it seems the jTidy library currently doesn't do a great job. 
Any information any of you have on the status of the jTidy project would be helpful. 
I have already looked at their forums and there are no answers to questions similar to this one there. 
The jTidy webpage suggests using this mailing list for further info. 
Thanks 
I imagine the answer to all of these questions is - "nobody knows" or 
"nothing is happening with jtidy" but I figured i shoud at least ask. 
Thanks in advance, Bill 
That's at least my answer; I suggest to contact the project developers for more information. 
I missed the original post but atleast one person is working with jtidy. 
I ported it to j# in .net 
(which was suprisingly easy - very few changes) so that I could use tidy on ISPs that didn't allow registration of DLLs (which is how TidyCOM is implemented) - it's also a cleaner implementaion in .NET 
architecture. 
It hasn't been extensively tested yet so I didn't bring it up... but if you want the J# .NET project I could send it your way.
