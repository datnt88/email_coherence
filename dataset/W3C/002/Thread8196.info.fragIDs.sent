<s> I've been looking into the problem of locating WebDAV servers on an intranet.  </s>
<s> Companies that have WebDAV servers on their net may not wish to have users manually configure various clients with the names of all those servers.  </s>
<s> In researching this problem, I've found only one standards-based approach, and that's SLP.  </s>
<s> Who would be interested in defining a WebDAV extension so that Service Location Protocol (SLP) clients can distinguish WebDAV servers from plain Web servers?  </s>
<s> Any feedback on how this should work?  </s>
<s> Or are there other options I'm ignorant of?  </s>
<s> The SLP specification: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2608.txt  </s>
<s> SLP home page, links to open source project: http://www.srvloc.org/  </s>
<s> SLP and the Macintosh: http://www.opendoor.com/shareway/SLP.html  </s>
<s> Some background... SLP models SLP works in one of two models.  </s>
<s> In the direct client-to-server model, the client multicasts requests for a particular kind of service to the local network.  </s>
<s> Services of that type respond directly (unicast) to the client.  </s>
<s> I see problems with this model because it would require a WebDAV server to receive multicast.  </s>
<s> The second SLP model involves a directory agent to register services: +-------+ -Unicast SrvRqst- +-----------+ -Unicast SrvReg- +--------+  </s>
<s> User | | Directory | |Service | Agent | | Agent | | Agent |  </s>
<s> +-------+ -Unicast SrvRply- +-----------+ -Unicast SrvAck- +--------+ This model seems easier for WebDAV servers to implement (they just have to send their registration and accept the response).  </s>
<s> Service URLs Services advertise themselves using service names or schemes.  </s>
<s> As HTTP servers, WebDAV servers would probably therefore advertise themselves with the 'http' service type.  </s>
<s> E.g. service:http://myserver.com A client request for "service:http" would match against all HTTP and WebDAV servers advertising themselves in this way.  </s>
<s> For all matches, a list of attributes for the service can be returned to the client.  </s>
<s> I suspect the attribute list is the right place to advertise WebDAV support.  </s>
<s> This optimizes in a few directions: - to find all HTTP servers, whether WebDAV or not, the client only needs to send one service match request.  </s>
<s> - to find all WebDAV servers, the client only needs to send one request, and has to filter out the non-WebDAV responses.  </s>
<s> - It is not necessary for the client to send OPTIONS to all HTTP servers to discover WebDAV support.  </s>
<s> However, to discover additional WebDAV functionality that may be required unless we add additional detail.  </s>
<s> - HTTP/WebDAV servers only need to advertise themselves once, as a http service with WebDAV support attributes.  </s>
<s> This approach follows the approach for printers, which you can follow through examples in the RFC.  </s>

<s> Great find, Lisa.  </s>
<s> This is an issue we've been starting to focus on at Adobe, as well.  </s>
<s> I would be willing to collaborate on defining a WebDAV extension for SLP Service Agents (and interested clients).  </s>

<s> Hi all, I have been off doing other things for a while, just trying to catch up with a big backlog of WebDAV mail.  </s>
<s> In ignorance of SLP, is UDDI an option?  </s>
<s> I am not a UDDI expert, but my understanding is that it allows businesses to publicise services (including the protocol).  </s>
<s> For example, GILS is trying to use it to publicize the location of GILS (which uses the Z39.50 protocol) servers.  </s>
<s> It seems to have a bit of momentum in the commercial world with its relationship to SOAP.  </s>
