<s> Apart from fixing things like missing references, unclear explanations, typos, etc., there are some fairly big changes I propose to make in the next version of the MT. I'd like to get this out as quickly as I can so that people don't start making commitments based on the things that are going to change.  </s>
<s> This is a summary of those changes, to help the WG follow what is going on.  </s>
<s> Most of these have arisen from discussions with Peter Patel-Schneider, who deserves a lot of credit (or blame, if you prefer :-).  </s>
<s> I've taken the liberty of CCing this message to Peter.  </s>
<s> (Peter, please reply to me rather than the entire WG, thanks.) 1. Definition of RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> The current text refers to 'a partially labelled graph', which is potentially misleading, since in many mathematical contexts a 'graph' is defined in such a way that there can be at most one edge between any pair of nodes.  </s>
<s> Peter has suggested a very strict mathematical style be adopted, but I propose to clarify the English wording in the main text, and include a painstakingly precise 'mathematical' version in the appendix.  </s>
<s> 2. Dividing the vocabularies between RDF and RDFS .  </s>
<s> (Big one, this.  </s>
<s> It kind of grew as I was typing it.) Currently, RDF interpretations are defined on an arbitrary vocabulary; but Peter has pointed out that the M&amp;S requires that any RDF model include rdf:type as an rdf: Property, so this should be included in the RDF (not the RDFS) model theory.  </s>
<s> Thus, V is required to contain at least 'rdf:type', and the semantic equations include the requirement that I(rdf:type) is in IP. On thinking about this, I am inclined to go further, in fact, and require that *all* the rdf:-prefixed vocabulary is included in the vocabulary of any rdf interpretation, ie all of  </s>
<s> rdf:type rdf:Property, rdf:domain and rdf:range, together with the semantic restrictions on them, in effect pulling back some of the rdfs semantics back into rdf.  </s>
<s> In general, every interpretation is allowed to assign special meanings to some namespace, and so entailment is always with respect to that reserved  </s>
<s> namespace.  </s>
<s> (eg rdf:, rdfs:, daml:, etc.) The relation called 'rdf entailment' in the current MT will be re-christened 'basic entailment', and it corresponds to an empty namespace.  </s>
<s> What this suggests is doing the MT exposition in three 'stages' instead of two.  </s>
<s> Right now we have a kind of pure-rdf-logic notion of entailment, then all the special vocabulary is added in one lump in section 4. I propose that we leave the pure-rdf-logic part as it is - this is the semantics of the empty namespace, common to them all - then add the purely RDF vocabulary and analyse what happens when it is added (not much, see below); then add the rest of the RDFS vocabulary, and analyse what happens then.  </s>
<s> This would mean that rdf-entailment (as it will be called, ie entailment with respect to the rdf: namespace) will become a bit more like rdfs entailment is now; but only a bit like it.  </s>
<s> (Jos, sorry to make your life more complicated, but I think it will actually work out better for the entailment examples, in the end. )  </s>
<s> The following are true in any rdf interpretation of the rdf vocabulary (three typings and two domainings:) rdf:domain rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:range rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:type rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:domain rdf:domain rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:range: rdf:domain rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> We can't say anything about the ranges of rdf:domain and rdf:range, or about the domain or range of rdf:type, or the type of rdf:Property, since we don't (yet) have the notion of a class; they are just resources at this stage, and we don't have any way to even say that.  </s>
<s> The closure rules would be 1b ,5 and 6 from the current rdfs table xxx aaa yyy .  </s>
<s> --- aaa rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> xxx aaa yyy .  </s>
<s> &amp; aaa rdf:domain zzz .  </s>
<s> --- xxx rdf:type zzz .  </s>
<s> xxx aaa uuu .  </s>
<s> &amp; aaa rdf:range zzz .  </s>
<s> --- uuu rdf:type zzz .  </s>
<s> Until we get into RDFS, there are no other semantic constraints on IEXT(I(rdf:type)) and so assertions made with rdf:type will have no other special entailments.  </s>
<s> What these rules will do is quite simple.  </s>
<s> They take every occurrence of a property in any triple and 'decorate' it with the observation that it is an rdf:Property, and if anything is said about its domain and range, then they will say the appropriate thing about the subject and object, all using rdf:type; but that is all.  </s>
<s> They will increase the size of a graph with N triples by at most (N + 5) triples, all but two of the form foo rdf:type baz .  </s>
<s> This makes the contrast with RDFS more vivid, I think, and illustrates more forcibly the extra power that one gets from the notion of subclass.  </s>
<s> (Also, by the way, I think that the 'constant' triples for the rdfs closure, ie the ones that must be in any closure, can now be got by applying the rdf closure rules to the rdfs reserved vocabulary, which is very cute.)  </s>
<s> Similarly, the vocabulary of any RDFS interpretation will be required explicitly to contain all of rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:Class, rdfs:Resource and rdfs:Literal, and they will be considered to be 'rdfs-reserved' URIs.  </s>
<s> This is not made explicit currently.  </s>
<s> Overall, this will have more effect on the appearance and presentation of the MT document than on the actual content, in fact; but I think it is important, as it will make the relationship between RDF and RDFS both clearer and more, as it were, intimate.  </s>
<s> It also gives the IP part of the rdf interpretations something to do in RDF.  </s>
<s> This idea of having a reserved namespace which has a fixed semantics, and entailment in general being relative to such a reserved vocabulary, is a generally useful idea in any case, and it would be good to introduce it into the MT document explicitly.  </s>
<s> It gives a quite vivid picture of 'basic' rdf inference and semantics as a kind of base or core on which everything else is built, as well, which is very SW-PC, right?  </s>
<s> The contents will read something like this: 0. as now, 1. as now, with slight terminology change from 'rdf interpretation' to simply 'interpretation', emphasizing these are interpretations of the rdf graph syntax but make no assumptions about vocabulary.. 2. as now 3. as now, with similar terminological care.  </s>
<s> (Distinguish 'simple entailment' from 'rdf entailment' and 'rdfs entailment') 4. Interpretations of RDF vocabulary (introduces notion of 'reserved' vocabulary, ie with special meaning assigned by the semantics, rdf: prefix, and simple semantic conditions.) (It might be fun to take the example in figure 1 and show how it gets expanded...I'll see if that is feasible.) 5. RDF entailment (like current section 5, but relates rdf entailment to simple entailment using rules as above, with numerical analysis sketched out.) 6. Interpretations of RDFS vocabulary (extends 4. to full rdfs, with extra semantic equations, introduces ICEXT.) (May add some extra commentary on how this can all be said in terms of rdf:type, but only by using implication, which motivates the rules coming up:) 7. RDFS entailment (like current section 6, but obviously corrected.  </s>
<s> text will point out how the new rules interact with the limited rdf rules in section 5 and extend their power, with some simple examples.) 8. Containers (very brief, as now; but stated in terms of another vocabulary extension; the point here being that all the needed semantic restrictions can be stated axiomatically in RDFS.) 3. Change to rdfs:Literal The current MT has the semantic rule: ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV I propose to weaken this to ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) is a subset of LV Contrary to appearances, this brings this condition more into line with the corresponding condition for rdfs:Resource: ICEXT(I(rdfs:Resource)) = IR since IR is only required to be *a* set of resources (not the set of *all* resources.)  </s>
<s> The technical motivation for this arises from Peter's observation that the truth-condition for rdf:type entails that IR must contain every member of the class extension of every named rdfs class, so the mere presence of rdfs:Literal in the vocabulary as an RDFS class requires that every member of ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) is in IR; so if applied with the current MT condition on rdf:Literal, it has the unfortunate consequences that all literal values must be in the IR universe of every interpretation (so all literal values must be resources), and that all rdfs closures would be infinite.  </s>
<s> This change has rdfs:Literal being treated in a special way; but in fact this makes sense, since the set LV of literal values has a special status in that it is defined 'outside' of the interpretation, so it seems unreasonable to require all interpretations to contain all of it.  </s>
<s> It retains the agnosticism about the relationship between IR and LV that the model theory was intended to have.  </s>
<s> 4. rdfs closure rules As previously noted, several important cases involving domain and range were omitted from the list of 'required' triples in rdfs.  </s>
<s> (Some of these are now in rdf).  </s>
<s> When added, these make some of the table entries redundant.  </s>
<s> I will have a detailed correction/revision to this whole thing ready by Monday, I hope.  </s>
<s> However, the general approach of defining rdfs entailment in terms of simple entailment on closures seems to be sound.  </s>

<s> Does this mean you are proposing to move domain and range from rdfs: to rdf: namespace?  </s>
