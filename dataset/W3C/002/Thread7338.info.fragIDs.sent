<s> What can you tell me about existing products that support LINK/UNLINK?  </s>
<s> I'd like to have a URI such that a GET on that URI would return a multipart/related mesage containing those documents LINKed to a given base document.  </s>
<s> I also want to be able to dynamically change this list by issuing  </s>
<s> LINK and UNLINK commands to the same URI.  </s>
<s> Basically, when I got interested in WEBDAV I saw this as a key ingredient in a patient record system.  </s>
<s> Now, much to my (pleasant) surprise, one of my coworkers just returned from an HL7 conference and independently expressed an interest in the same functionality.  </s>
<s> They even planned to discuss web maps at the conference but ran out of time (or so I am told)!  </s>

<s> Do you mean you'd like to know what other resources (documents) on the Web contain LINKs with a destination equal to the specified URI?  </s>
<s> If so, what do you suggest as the scope of the search?  </s>
<s> Just the same server?  </s>
<s> A specified list of servers?  </s>
<s> All servers on the Web?  </s>
<s> If you mean that you'd like to retrieve the LINKs *stored with* the specified URI (and therefore whose destinations are other resources) this is much better defined, and within the scope of WEBDAV.  </s>
<s> I'd resist the temptation to turn WEBDAV into a general distributed database protocol :-)  </s>

<s> This is fine.  </s>
<s> I had in mind a request that would return the object itself if it was on the same server, and a URI otherwise.  </s>
<s> Returning just the URI in all cases may be a better design.  </s>
<s> I'll have to think about it.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> I didn't express myself very well.  </s>
