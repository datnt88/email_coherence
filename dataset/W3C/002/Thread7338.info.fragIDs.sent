What can you tell me about existing products that support LINK/UNLINK? 
I'd like to have a URI such that a GET on that URI would return a multipart/related mesage containing those documents LINKed to a given base document. 
I also want to be able to dynamically change this list by issuing 
LINK and UNLINK commands to the same URI. 
Basically, when I got interested in WEBDAV I saw this as a key ingredient in a patient record system. 
Now, much to my (pleasant) surprise, one of my coworkers just returned from an HL7 conference and independently expressed an interest in the same functionality. 
They even planned to discuss web maps at the conference but ran out of time (or so I am told)!

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come to come up with a better one. 
Do you mean you'd like to know what other resources (documents) on the Web contain LINKs with a destination equal to the specified URI? 
If so, what do you suggest as the scope of the search? 
Just the same server? 
A specified list of servers? 
All servers on the Web? 
If you mean that you'd like to retrieve the LINKs *stored with* the specified URI (and therefore whose destinations are other resources) this is much better defined, and within the scope of WEBDAV. 
I'd resist the temptation to turn WEBDAV into a general distributed database protocol :-)

This is fine. 
I had in mind a request that would return the object itself if it was on the same server, and a URI otherwise. 
Returning just the URI in all cases may be a better design. 
I'll have to think about it. 
Good point. 
I didn't express myself very well.
