<s> Just to clarify, by "XSLT libraries" I really meant XSLT processing software not a directory of XSLT stylesheets.  </s>
<s> I guess there is double entendre in my wording that needs to be removed.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, it may also very well be that an application wants to specify the transformation XSLT as one of the Object s being signed.  </s>
<s> I don't think the current syntax supports that construct yet.  </s>
<s> In fact, this may be an issue with a number of the Transformation sub-elements.  </s>
<s> Regarding dynamic access to libraries (whether they be software or data), we have to allow for clients operating in offline mode.  </s>
<s> So as much as I like XSLT, I think we have to keep the phrase about XSLT processing resources not being readily available.  </s>

<s> You need nothing more than a URI and HTTP to have dynamic access to an XSLT instance.  </s>
<s> Whether signature applications will want to be reliant to on-line access is up to them.  </s>
