<s> This is the last important comment that I have on rfc2396bis-04, the rest are just typos,... Section 3.2.2, in particular the paragraph starting with "This specification does not mandate a particular registered name lookup technology...", is highly unclear.  </s>
<s> In particular, it's not clear to me what restrictions schemes can make (or not) in this respect.  </s>
<s> In my view, the current reality (and what the document should clearly say) is as follows: - Some schemes (e.g. file:) leave the choice of name lookup/ resolution completely to the OS.  </s>
<s> They are mostly designed for local access.  </s>
<s> - Other schemes clearly define what naming system is used.  </s>
<s> Examples are http:, ftp:,...  </s>
<s> They usually use DNS, but some schemes may use another system.  </s>
<s> How the host names actually get resolved/looked up may be somewhat different on different systems, but modulo caching,... the result should be the same.  </s>
<s> If you think that this is different, please explain why.  </s>
<s> If you think that my description above is going in the right direction, please make this much clearer in the draft.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Similar to the issue of "octets = ASCII conversion", I do not see any change in the spec nor any answer to (cited below).  </s>
<s> I do not think that host should be case-insensitive in the generic syntax, because this would unduely restrict the use of URIs with potential future systems.  </s>
<s> I know that others have made the same comment in private, so I really wonder why it hasn't been addressed.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure this issue can be addressed on the RFC editor level, but it definitely should be addressed.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> What systems would that be?  </s>
<s> I don't know of any system for which host is case-sensitive, and I do know that making it explicitly case-insensitive within the generic syntax allows systems the ability to reduce the number of arbitrary aliases due to legacy name resolvers and sloppy rewrites.  </s>
<s> Because the comment did not reflect existing practice.  </s>
