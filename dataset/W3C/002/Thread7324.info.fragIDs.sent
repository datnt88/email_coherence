<s> While it is not mandatory for a server to support an audit log, it is very common.  </s>
<s> Most document access clients provide a "Show History" feature.  </s>
<s> Therefore I need a standard way to ask for audit log entries pertaining to a particular document, user or date-time range.  </s>
<s> I didn't see audit log access anywhere in the WebDAV requirements.  </s>
<s> I would consider this a requirement for a useful WebDAV server.  </s>

<s> For versioned resources, there is a requirement (5.9.2.7) which states that the version topology for a version graph must be retrievable.  </s>
<s> This gives you predecessor and successor relationships for each member of a version graph.  </s>
<s> What type of information is typically included in an audit log?  </s>
<s> What are the use scenarios for this information?  </s>
<s> Why do you feel there needs to be an interoperability specification for this information?  </s>

<s> System administrators can often submit queries against an audit log, like "What resources has user X accessed in the past month?"  </s>
<s> "Who has modified the metadata of resource R in the past month?"  </s>
<s> "How many users have accessed resource R in the past month?"  </s>
<s> This kind of information can be useful for billing, depending on what service is being provided.  </s>
<s> It seems to be more in the area of site administration than authoring, though.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether it's really in the scope of WEBDAV.  </s>
