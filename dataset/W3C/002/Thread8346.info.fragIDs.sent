Hi, 
Maybe it would be more appropriate to reuse the response codes as defined for MOVE in RFC 2518: 201: newly created 204: replaced existing resource etc. 
I agree. 
MOVE should be identical to BIND/DELETE, and therefore consistency with MOVE response codes seems to make sense. 
Proposal: Add the sentence: "In case of success, the server SHOULD return 201 (Created) when a new binding was created and 204 (No Content) when an existing binding was replaced".

If we handled it the way proposed below, the old clients will just ignore the new element, and the user will incorrectly conclude that the 
collection 
had no child by that name. 
With the original proposal, users of old clients will be told that there is a child, and will get the error message that they've already seen that child, so it is being left out of the report. 
I think the later is preferable. 
I agree that introducing a new error marshalling concept just for an edge case here (Depth: infinity and bind loop) is unnecessary, in particular if it may confuse old clients. 
Therefore the issue should be closed.

Hi, one other thing we'll need to change at some point are the host names that are used in the examples (RFC2606 lists reserved domain names that can be used). 
Julian 
I also agree. 
I'll make this change and mark the issue as closed, unless someone objects. 
Cheers, Geoff Hi,

Done. Cheers, Geoff Hi, one other thing we'll need to change at some point are the host names that are used in the examples (RFC2606 lists reserved domain names that can be used).
