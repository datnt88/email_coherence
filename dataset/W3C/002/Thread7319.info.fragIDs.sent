<s> I've volunteered and Jim has accepted me as document editor for the access control issue.  </s>
<s> I am currently working on a "Requirements" draft which will serve as the direction for a later Draft Specification for access control.  </s>
<s> It is possible that access control will grow too big for this WG; it may grow into either a subgroup of WEBDAV or even a WG of its own.  </s>
<s> This will be determined later.  </s>
<s> Right now, I am soliciting initial input on some major questions we need to answer before we can even begin drafting the Requirements specification.  </s>
<s> I would like to propose some initial questions.  </s>
<s> I'll compile responses together, and then that can serve as a basis for discussing the pros/cons of different things that could show up in the Requirements draft.  </s>
<s> If you have other issues that you think should be discussed, please send them to me.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Should an access control specification attempt to encompass any of the following: a) Potential extensions to HTTP; b) A server-based API approach; c) A file-oriented specification (e.g., an Access Control List specification for the Web).  </s>
<s> We need to determine if the scope of the Requirements will be to include one or more of the above items, and the pros/cons of different ways of solving the issue through the different overall approaches.  </s>
<s> 2. If an API based approach is used, what is the best design philosophy to utilize?  </s>
<s> An ODBC-like approach consisting of modular API design which separates implementation from interface has already been discussed in this group.  </s>
<s> Are there other ideas?  </s>
<s> 3. Should the Specification attempt to include any of the following: a) A _required_ set of access control token-naming-conventions b) A _suggested_ set of access control token-naming-conventions If either of the above, what should the scope of tokens include?  </s>
<s> What are the kinds of access we need to think about? 4. Should the access control specification reflect a particular file-system convention, e.g., the UNIX-based filesystem, or should the specification include any sort of policy and/or protocol that abstracts filesystem from access control data?  </s>
<s> If it uses an "abstracted" filesystem, is it safe to assume  </s>
<s> that URL-based conventions are the best way to specify control over a file?  </s>
<s> How does existing work in the areas of filesystems (e.g., Andrew, etc.) reflect on these concepts?  </s>
<s> 5. Should the specification include any notions around "groups" or should this be implementation dependent?  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> How should the access control specification deal with the identity of a user, i.e., what authentication standard/proposal will the implementation explicitly support, if any?  </s>
<s> If an API-based specification is pursued, should the API explicitly support an interface to a specific authentication interface or should it be fairly abstract?  </s>
<s> 7. Should there be any embedded/defined support for the object model in the access control system, e.g., inheritance of access tokens.  </s>
<s> 8. Should the scope of the access control specification include: a) Checking to see if a user has a certain permission; b) Assigning permissions to a user; c) Revoking permissions; d) Relating permissions to objects on the Web; e) Any other management-related functions?  </s>
<s> 9. What are the ideas around non-file-access type permissions?  </s>
<s> (For example, permissions that define what a user is allowed to do inside an application).  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Should the draft specification intend to ultimately include a reference implementation?  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> What other questions are there?  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Jon Radoff NovaLink  </s>
<s> I'd like to thank Jon for taking the lead for coordinating work on access control within WebDAV, and for starting a dialog on this topic.  </s>
<s> I would agree that 3 and 4 are out of scope.  </s>
<s> Defining #1 is also out of scope, because there are many others working on that components.  </s>
<s> Our role here should be to determine which #1 we are going to support.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the Access Control document will be concerned principally with #2.  </s>
<s> I agree with both the slicing of the topic into the above four areas and the assertion by Jon that we are primarily concerned with how to support various authentication schemes (#1), and how to specify Web access control (#2), but not #3 and #4.  </s>
<s> I'd like to throw out for discussion a "minimalist" view of access control.  </s>
<s> My hypothesis is the only access control necessary in the client-server WebDAV protocol is a method which temporarily changes the access rights of a resource such that only (write) lock holders may read the resource, and another message which reverts the access rights back to their original form once editing is complete (or perhaps this happens automatically once all locks are released).  </s>
<s> This limited access control provides document privacy during editing, so authors are assured that others will not be reading their preliminary work.  </s>
<s> If more sophisticated access control is needed, this can be accomplished by using server-specific forms to modify the access rights according to the server's specific access control scheme.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that interoperability is needed for more complicated access control.  </s>
<s> Advantages: it's very simple, most likely would be consistent with any future access control standard, and seems to handle the most compelling case for why there needs to be *interoperable* client-server access control.  </s>
<s> There are many reasons for why it is desirable to have Web access control capability, but it is a different argument to say that Web access control must be achievable via some interoperability scheme, be it a protocol or an API.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see some scenarios for why we need a full-featured access control specification for WebDAV.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I think this is a good approach that should certainly be included.  </s>
<s> This brings up the topic of whether the specification needs to understand the concept of "ownership" of a particular object.  </s>
<s> Yes, there is "ownership" in the sense of the operating system ownership of objects, but this ownership is rarely consistent with the identities of the actual users editing the files.  </s>
<s> In fact, it is also pretty rare the .htaccess-type  </s>
<s> security models have a logical mapping to individuals involved in content creation.  </s>
<s> Is it necessary to provide users with the ability to change ownership of objects?  </s>
<s> In this sense, the "WebDAV" ownership of an object would be distinct from the "operating system" ownership of the object.  </s>
<s> The Web server/WEBDAV implementation would be responsible for maintaining whatever lists are necessary for providing the object-to-user ownership mapping.  </s>
<s> Another idea: an approach that could eliminate the need for an "ownership" concept might be the ability to assign and revoke access "tokens" to individual objects.  </s>
<s> For example, each object could have a "Modify Token" which can be set to a particular value.  </s>
<s> The WEBDAV-server implementation would check to make sure the authenticated user "owns" that particular token before letting them perform the related action.  </s>
