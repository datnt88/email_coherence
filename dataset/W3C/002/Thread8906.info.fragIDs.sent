Joseph, 
I am a bit concerned with the use of the term "signer authentication" in the dsig recommendation. 
These two sentences from the dsig (coupled with the definition of "signer authentication" from the glossary) seem to contradict each other: "... XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type.." "The XML Signature is a method of associating a key with referenced data (octets); it does not normatively 
specify how keys are associated with persons or institutions..." The first sentences says that we support signer authentication and the second sentences says that we don't. 
I think it is clear that there is no way to validate the verification-key-to-person relationship (XML dsig can't do path validation by itself) using only XML dsig, so I am really wondering about the definition of "signer authentication services." 
Is it necessary to say that XML dsig supports signer authentication services? 
Is this refering to the inclusion of verification material in the signature itself (such as KeyInfo )? 
Thanks, Blake Dournaee 
Perhaps the terminology may be somewhat misleading... 
Any digital signature cannot offer signer authentication by itself. 
Signature can be replayed, be it an XML one or a different format. 
While under a PKI one can trace the liability of the signers' identity to a higher level (or a different person), one may even trust them, however it does not assure the other party sent you the message in response to you. 
For that you need to have nonces in your employ. 
Authentication of signer here may mean two things: 1. authentication of a conversation party 2. authentication of origin The second can be achieved through signatures (e.g. XML sigs). 
Are we certain the users will only understand it in this sense and not the first one?

An admittedly labored, but intended, reading of this is to note the "and/or" in the first clause. 
So XML Signature can contribute to signer authentication decision but is not necessarily sufficient. 
I've tweaked the definitions to make this clearer, and added links to those definitions in the first clause: [Resulting document: $Revision: 1.66 $ on $Date: 2001/06/05 18:41:28 $ by $Author: reagle Authentication Code (Protected Checksum) A value generated from the application of a shared key to a message via a cryptographic algorithm such that it has the properties of [349]message authentication (and [350]integrity) but not [351]signer authentication. 
Equivalent to protected checksum, "A checksum that is computed for a data object by means that protect against active attacks that would attempt to change the checksum to make it match changes made to the data object." 
[[352]SEC] Authentication, Message The property, given an [353]authentication code/[354]protected checksum, that tampering with both the data and checksum, so as to introduce changes while seemingly preserving [355]integrity, are still detected. 
"A signature should identify what is signed, making it impracticable to falsify or alter either the signed matter or the signature without detection." 
[[356]Digital Signature Guidelines, [357]ABA]. 
Authentication, Signer The property that the identity of the signer is as claimed. 
"A signature should indicate who signed a document, message or record, and should be difficult for another person to produce without authorization." 
[[358]Digital Signature Guidelines, [359]ABA] Note, signer authentication is an application decision (e.g., does the signing key actually correspond to a specific identity) that is supported by, but out of scope, of this specification. 
Checksum "A value that (a) is computed by a function that is dependent on the contents of a data object and (b) is stored or transmitted together with the object, for the purpose of detecting changes in the data." 
[[360]SEC] Integrity "The property that data has not been changed, destroyed, or lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner." 
[[367]SEC] A simple [368]checksum can provide integrity from incidental changes in the data; [369]message authentication is similar but also protects against an active attack to alter the data whereby a change in the checksum is introduced so as to match the change in the data.
