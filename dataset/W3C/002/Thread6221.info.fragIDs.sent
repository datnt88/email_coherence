Is the Semantic Web a MetaWeb? 
(or I'm I just confused) (If you are not into fuzzy discussions, please ignore this posting, and I apologize in advance. 
Sorry for the cross posting, don't know if this is the appropriate mailing list.but 
let's give it a try ;-)) 
I have seen a lot of prospect explanations on what the Semantic Web actually is, but none of them does answer the question in a way that I'm looking for. 
Of course, it is not an easy question to answer. 
But, as I'm only into theoretical datology, I'm looking for a simple answer to a difficult question that's right up my alley. 
I'm looking for an answer that is similar (in certain ways) to the answer of what the Web is. 
I answer the question of what the Web is with the answer: the URI-space. 
(Not if my dad ask, but in my head) The answer to the SW question I'm looking for is not to make it easier for a layperson to grasp the Semantic Web, it only to satisfy my own thoughts. 
(Throughout, metadata is considered to be machine usable in the way the SW community so often speaks about.) 
Now to the "meta" part. 
If we attach metadata to a resource, it becomes in some sense easier for a machine to locate and use that resource (e.g. if the resource only contains natural language scribbling). 
Now, IMHO, the Semantic Web is a Web of metadata (+logic) that is intended to make it easier for machines (and us indirectly - but first and foremost) to locate and use resources on the Web. 
Thus, would it be wrong to call the Semantic Web a metaweb? 
The SW would then be a machine useable web (filled with machine understandable metadata pointing at web resources) about the web. 
Of course, the metaweb is also a web (just like metadata could be data), and they exist in the same space - though at different levels of abstractions. 
A bit simplified: humans use the web and machines use the metaweb (SW) to help humans use the web better. 
Thus, the Semantic Web is: a machine understandable metaweb. 
(the SW is only useful if layered on top of the web.) 
Just as metadata is attached to resources, the metaweb is attached to the web. 
Note, there is a few loopholes that I'm not getting into right now (to not take to much of your time), perhaps these will come up if this is further discussed. 
All this sounds a bit odd perhaps, but it makes it clear the machines will never understand resources written in natural languages, only the metadata attached to it. 
Thanks for your time! 
Happily accepts any comments!

Benny, 
Semantic Web certainly includes meta web. 
However, I believe it is more than the meta data in an important way: 
The "meata data" needs to be associated with an ontology. 
In another word, the meaning and the interpretation of the meta data depends on the context (i.e., the associated ontology) rather than being universal.

Yen, 
Perhaps I was a bit too fuzzy, but I did not mean that it should only be "un-grounded" metadata. 
I hope that the image [1] could make my fuzzy ideas clearer, even if the image is a bit chaotic ;-) [1] http://www.araby-dalbo.com/users/1131/21207/200104/metaweb.jpg 
Thanks for your feedback!

I disagree. 
It need not have an ontology, but merely a URI -- a space in the Web. 
Thus, meaning is universal.

If meaning is universal, you have to be able to define it in an unique machine-parsable way, e.g. translate it one-to-one into an URI. 
Then, however, you jump into an discussion that is, in the best case, only a linguistic discours, but I believe there is an entire contextual network or even many layers of contextual networks below it. 
Words are full of ambiguity, as human thinking is (especially the abstract ones - "music" or "time" or "love" means to everybody exactly what his/her culture, sex, education, individuality etc. make it to be), and you have to cope with this somewhere between the humans and the machine. 
Defining dozens of meanings for thousands of words and criteria to distinguish between them along with keeping up-to-date with language evolution obviously can't work. 
Are semantic nets a good tool for modelling cultural context? 
Hope someone will be able to give me a hint, too, as this mailing list seems to be more appropriate to the topic.

Subject: Cultural background subtleties vs. a language discussion? 
While reading the English-Italian discussion of Eric and Marco, I had the impression that it is the top of a very, very huge iceberg. 
Just a few examples: a.. Indeed, most of the content in a book can be translated more or less correctly. 
However, this holds true to a much greater extent for a technical manual than for a Shakespeare or Petrarca sonet. 
b.. 
Or a simpler point: How do you translate into Italian "It rains cats and dogs"? 
In my mother tongue, Bulgarian, the idiom says "it rains as if pooring out of a tin" which has quite nothing in common, lexically or gramatically, with the English one. 
I favour the opinion that in languages, there is a large portion of some sort of "non-verbal communication" basing on common cultural patterns. 
I had an experience of this phenomenon myself when participating in an international essay contest limited to the UNO languages + German. 
From their interviews I had the impression the German jury that reviewed my essay was unconsciously looking for their own cultural patterns and, therefore, unconsciously rejected most of the pieces that did not fit into them - except of the most picturesque ones. 
Further, being not so familiar with French culture, I had myself great difficulties in comprehending the ideas in the French essays I come to read afterwards. 
I think successful i18n should address this kind of issues, too, beside technical matters. 
Maybe in terms of finding out and cultivating transcultural communication styles and habits? 
My questions: a.. Does anybody know about research done on cultural patterns, or context, and what is the correct term for it? 
b.. What kind of approaches have been tried out - I know of culturology, linguistics, AI, cognitive science; but with so complex a topic, there certainly must be much more. 
c.. Does it relate to the concept of cultural networks, if someone can define this one? 
d.. 
Any experience as to which nations have more rigid cultural frameworks imposed on their thinking patterns, maybe depending on the size of the nationality? 
Does this relate to the wilingness/ability to learn foreign languages? 
e.. If this is the wrong mailing list, please give me some hints where to go Thank you for helping, Kremena 
The Semantic Web is built on the idea that there is not an inherent set of meaning to the Universe, as some of the Knowledge Representation people would tell you, but that machine should be able to come to conclusions according to the scope of the information that they are fed. 
What the Semantic Web tries to achieve, by using a set of decentralized identifiers (URIs), is to increase that scope, and therefore the usefulness of any applications built on top of it. 
The Semantic Web can be used to translate between cultural idioms if you record that information someplace in a repurposable form. 
At the 
moment, you will have a lot of work to do because there aren't enough persistent ontologies around for you to construct meaningful patterns that people can investigate and use, but groups such as HumanMarkup (http://www.humanmarkup.org/) are apparently chartered to fill in the gaps. 
This could be modelled in Notation3 (a form of RDF) as:- [ xml:lang "en"; :language :Bulgarian; :phrase "it rains as if pouring out of a tin" ] :idiomaticallyRelatedTo [ xml:lang "en"; :language :English; :phrase "it's raining cats and dogs" ] . 
Now all we need is for people to build some automatic idiom translators!

Simile/metaphor/sarcasm/humor/irony/+ are basic problems for machines because they are deliberately inflicted with the "disability" of "semantic/pragmatic" or taking things literally. 
*How* it's "raining" (whether "cats &amp; dogs" or "a cow pissing on a flat rock") is an example of the poor computer girding its defenses for animal attacks when flooding is the potential problem. 
Love.
