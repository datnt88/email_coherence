<s> I'm sorry to intrude into the issue-resolving process with a hammer rather than tweezers.  </s>
<s> Although we are bound to backward compatibility in many respects, I think we still have a chance to nail down some shaky pieces of the frame.  </s>
<s> Putting off the metaphors, I'd like to suggest several incremental layers for the RDF model spec, and a way of building advanced languages on top of those.  </s>
<s> The idea is to keep each layer thin, and to provide model-theoretic semantics a la layer.  </s>
<s> Application developers may choose to support a certain subset of layers.  </s>
<s> Tentatively, I could imagine the following layering: - Layer 1: Abstract syntax based on resources and triples only (no literals, no predefined vocabulary, no reification).  </s>
<s> Namespaces are part of the formal model (missing in current spec).  </s>
<s> Interpretation (semantics) is specified using a model-theoretic approach.  </s>
<s> - Layer 2: Literals are declared as a specific kind of resources belonging to a certain namespace (e.g. http://www.w3.org/.../Literal).  </s>
<s> Literals may be used as subjects (this is an extension).  </s>
<s> - Layer 3: Reification added to abstract syntax (e.g. as a symbol for a partial function).  </s>
<s> Interpretation of the reification function maps DxDxD to D (D is domain of discourse).  </s>
<s> The corresponding vocabulary elements  </s>
<s> (subject, predicate, object) may be defined here (rdf:type still missing).  </s>
<s> Reified statements are first-class objects in the model, i.e. applications may implement them as Java classes, database tuples with IDs etc. Statements are directly mapped to individuals in the domain of  </s>
<s> discourse, no resources/URI that identify them are required per se (identifiers for statements can be introduced later on if needed).  </s>
<s> - Layer 4: rdf:type is introduced as a basic typing mechanism (broader than class instantiation).  </s>
<s> - Layer 5: defines e.g. containers (for backward compatibility only.  </s>
<s> I think containers are a topic of its own, and belongs to the issues like representing order, aggregation etc.) - (more model features...)  </s>
<s> This proposal might seem radical, but I think most of the suggestions are incremental.  </s>
<s> The features listed above (namespaces, literals, reification etc.) are intended to be backward compatible and may be introduced in a different order.  </s>
<s> The semantics of a language "built on top of RDF" (like DAML/OIL) can be defined by restricting interpretation functions used in the existing layers or by defining new ones.  </s>
<s> Specifying "new" semantics in this way may result in a larger or smaller  </s>
<s> number of valid interpretations.  </s>
<s> The set of statements that are subject of semantic interpretation can be selected in an unspecified, application-specific way.  </s>
<s> Since semantics proved to be a highly controversial issue, I would suggest to strictly split each layer into abstract syntax (+ examples) / formal semantics part.  </s>
<s> The developers who care about running apps more than about formal semantics may ignore the parts they don't want to deal with.  </s>

<s> I'm trying to understand what you mean and I'm struggling with that last sentence.  </s>
<s> No matter how many times I read it, I'm not understanding it.  </s>
<s> It's in particular that set of statements subject semantic interpretation unspecified selection So what does that last sentence actually mean?  </s>

<s> Let me give an example.  </s>
<s> We expect to find RDF statements on many webpages and in many online data sources.  </s>
<s> Specific applications typically consider only a subset of all available data (e.g. certain domain, certain set of trusted servers, certain vocabularies, etc.) I was trying to convey the idea that meaningful semantics exists only for such limited datasets, whose boundaries are determined in a particular application context.  </s>
<s> It probably would be inappropriate to refer to the set of all webpages on public servers when say defining the semantics of rdf:type.  </s>
<s> Sergey  </s>
<s> Thats a function of the machinery used for the definition.  </s>
<s> If you want to use standard model theory, I don't see why you could use all the rdf on all the servers in the world.  </s>

<s> Namespaces are part of the formal model (missing in current spec).  </s>
<s> How do you suggest we do this and why?  </s>
<s> Do you have something against data: (which seems to be the popular candidate)?  </s>

<s> While I agree with your overall theme here, it seems to go beyond the remit of RDFcore, as it requires a basic change to the language.  </s>
<s> However, what you say about semantics isnt exactly right.  </s>
<s> After all, one *can* give a model theory for FOL, which is about as global in scope as one could imagine (way larger than the mere Web, for example.) Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
<s> For some reason, several people seem to be unhappy about the above side remark of mine.  </s>
<s> If it does not make sense, well scrap it.  </s>
<s> If you mean Stefan, we do have lots of opinionated discussions on many RDF-related issues.  </s>
<s> However, I'm glad that we look consistent from the outside ;)  </s>
<s> I'm happy to hear that layering is not a hopeless venue.  </s>
<s> I'd very much appreciate your help along those lines, since several of the RDFCore members including myself are far from being experts in formal logic.  </s>
<s> I apologize in advance for many things that I will be arguing for that may not make sense.  </s>
<s> In particular, I hope you could find time to summarize the approaches to reification extensively discussed on rdf-logic (Brian called for a summary on that issue a couple of days ago).  </s>
<s> That would be a great help, especially for the F2F.  </s>
