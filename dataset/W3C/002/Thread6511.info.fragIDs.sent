<s> Out of curiosity, how exactly is the XHTML validator getting past the homepage for W3C?  </s>
<s> The basic spec for XHTML should not allow it to validate the page for a number of reasons: Markup tags are in upper and lower case (consistancy).  </s>
<s> Attributes are not quoted (lots of them).  </s>
<s> Terminated elements are not adheared to (li tags).  </s>
<s> Non-Terminated empty tags are present (img, br and hr).  </s>
<s> Since I'm currently working on a lot of XML/XHTML and trying to get it all nailed down, I just thought it curious that the W3C's page doesn't conform and displays the "validated" tag at the bottom of the page.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> Just think'n it's a little odd, Aaron W. Silver awsilver@renderology.com www.renderology.com  </s>
<s> Could you elaborate a little and give us example of these bugs?  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, the homepage doesn't have such issues.  </s>
<s> Could you attach the html file you get at www.w3.org?  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your help!  </s>

<s> FYI: Here what the problem was: when you save a HTML document with IE 5.5, IE modifies it and makes it invalid.  </s>
<s> That's where the confusion came from.  </s>
