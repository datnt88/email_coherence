<s> YAWN, hire a Prolog programmar.  </s>
<s> e.g. suppose we have a predicate triple(Subject,Property,Object).  </s>
<s> defining our RDF database implement a predicate rdf_n(Property,N) that succeeds whenever N is a positive integer and Property is "rdf:_" N appropriately expressed.  </s>
<s> Then a bag for example would be: rdfBag(URI,Contents) :- bagof( Object, [N,Property]^ ( triple(URI,Property,Object), rdf_n(Property,N) ), Contents ).  </s>
<s> For a sequence rdfSeq(URI,Contents) :- bagof( N*Object, [Property]^ ( triple(URI,Property,Object), rdf_n(Property,N) ), UnsortedContents ), sort(UnsortedContents, SortedContents ), % line below will work but is not efficient.  </s>

<s> I raised this issue, and I didn't say anything about prolog when I raised it.  </s>

<s> the code below works; if it works, it relies on prolog's closed-world reasoning, which I find unacceptable.  </s>
<s> The issue is: how do I conclude that something is *not* in a sequence?  </s>
<s> e.g. how do I write an empty sequence?  </s>
<s> what does it look like in n-triples?  </s>
<s> I could write but that will end up in n-triples as _:something rdf:type rdf:Seq.  </s>
<s> but it won't say that _:something has no members.  </s>
<s> Without the ability to tell where the end of a sequence is, they're of little use in the applications I build.  </s>
<s> I tend to use DAML+OIL's first/rest, including a special parseType="ont:collection".  </s>
<s> what does that code do when there are rdf_n doesn't succeed at all?  </s>
<s> Does it conclude by NAF that Contents is empty?  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I was sort of hacking this up with RDF and prolog, and I discovered that I couldn't inductively define sort() over RDF sequences because there's no empty list in RDF.  </s>
<s> There's no end marker.  </s>
<s> I agree I did a lousy job of characterizing this accurately.  </s>
