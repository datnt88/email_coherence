<s> In case anyone was wondering, the reason that the inference aaa bbb "foo"^^ddd .  </s>
<s> -- aaa bbb _:xxx .  </s>
<s> _:xxx rdf:type ddd .  </s>
<s> didnt get put into RDFS (but was left until the datatypes were introduced) is because, contrary to what I first thought, this inference DOES depend on access to datatype information, in order to check that 'foo' is a legal lexical form according to the datatype ddd.  </s>
<s> So even though it doesnt depend on the particular value, it does need external datatype information to be valid.  </s>
<s> Just a quick explanation.  </s>
<s> Also, after Jos' question I guess I ought to either remove that comment or else put in a bit more explanation.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
