In case anyone was wondering, the reason that the inference aaa bbb "foo"^^ddd . 
-- aaa bbb _:xxx . 
_:xxx rdf:type ddd . 
didnt get put into RDFS (but was left until the datatypes were introduced) is because, contrary to what I first thought, this inference DOES depend on access to datatype information, in order to check that 'foo' is a legal lexical form according to the datatype ddd. 
So even though it doesnt depend on the particular value, it does need external datatype information to be valid. 
Just a quick explanation. 
Also, after Jos' question I guess I ought to either remove that comment or else put in a bit more explanation. 
Sigh.

Maybe, but that's wordsmithing and not needed for this round.

Hmmm... when I stumbled across that niggle, I wondered if you might not introduce some "bottom" concept into the domain of interpretation, so even invalid lexical forms have a denotation.

Nah, that doesn't work, Ive been there. 
In order to avoid warping the entire logic it has to be on the side rather than on the bottom, as it were. 
But I think I will indeed do that as it avoids some problems that Peter is worried about, and its simpler in any case.

I don't think that the entailment requires knowledge of the datatype. 
It is just relating synonymous forms of expression, not adding any knowledge. 
If the typed 
literal is invalid, then the bnode triple will be invalid, but one does not need to ensure validity to equate the two forms of expression.

Yes, but its the datatype that tells you which are synonymous with which, right? 
But in any case, my understanding right now is that rdf:type isn't going to be used in this way at all in the current version, so these inferences are never valid under any circumstances.
