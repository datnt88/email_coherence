For the RDF Community to answer... Question 1: 
Given the RDF graph: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#" Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning expressed in the above graph? 
1. Jenny's age and the Film's title are the same thing which is represented lexically by the string "10". 
2. Jenny's age and the Film's title are both the string "10". 
3. Jenny's age and the Film's title are (potentially) different things which are represented lexically by the same string. 
4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters. 
Question 2: Given the RDF graph: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs ="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" xmlns ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#" Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning expressed in the above graph? 
1. Jenny's age and Bob's age are the same thing, which is represented lexically by the string "10". 
2. Jenny's age and Bob's age are both the string "10". 
3. Jenny's age is the string "10" and Bob's age is something which is represented lexically by the string "10". 
4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters. 
I object to asking a question about a formalism in (exclusively) intuitive terms. 
I propose making it a test case instead or in addition, ala... # how does existing RDF software handle this datatypes test? 
Dan Connolly (Wed, Jan 30 2002) and regarding the 2nd question, since you made up the name uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#integer, please also make up an arbitrary name for the relationship betwen #age and #integer; i.e. don't use rdfs:range. 
Or: ask the question twice: once with rdfs:range, and once with rdfd:dcv as in

I forwarded this message from Patrick without reviewing it, as the network access at the face to face prevented Patrick accessing his own mail server. 
I have received an offlist message suggesting that the language it contained was inappropriate for this WG. 
I concur and appologise. 
I am embarrassed to have this message, sent from my mail account, in the archive.
