<s> Title: WebDAV Access Control Protocol Author(s): G. Clemm, A. Hopkins, E. Sedlar, J. Whitehead Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-acl-07.txt Pages: 59 Date: 12-Nov-01 This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and message bodies that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol.  </s>
<s> This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HTTP method invocations) by a given principal.  </s>

<s> Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages.  </s>

<s> Hi. (1) RFC2518 (WebDAV) is based on XML + namespaces and has chosen to use the namespace name "DAV:" to identify it's elements.  </s>
<s> Note that "DAV:" *is* a properly registered URI scheme (see [1]) (2) The XML namespaces recommendation says that an XML namespace is identified by a URI reference as defined in RFC2396.  </s>
<s> (3) RFC2396 gives the following grammar for absolute URIs:  </s>
<s> absoluteURI = scheme ":" ( hier_part | opaque_part ) opaque_part = uric_no_slash *uric "DAV:" doesn't seem to be a valid "opaque_part", because "opaque_part" MUST start with "uric_no_slash", thus it may not be empty.  </s>
<s> (4) I became aware of this mismatch when trying to develop a RELAG NG schema for WebDAV.  </s>
<s> James Clark's JING validator rejects the namespace name "DAV:" as invalid URI.  </s>
<s> So this has become a real-world problem (maybe it was "just" academic before).  </s>
<s> I think this means that either RFC2396 or RFC2518 need to be fixed.  </s>
<s> Feedback appreciated.  </s>

<s> * WebDAV marshals "dav:" URIs that are the name of XML elements as a {namespace} + {opaque_part} pair.  </s>
<s> So, for example, "dav:creationdate" is D:creationdate xmlns:D="dav:" .  </s>
<s> The XML Namespaces Recommendation provides a facility to name an element by a URI/local-name pair.  </s>
<s> It does not provide a facility to name an element by a URI.  </s>
<s> The element has a name that is a pair consisting of the (non-)URI "dav:" and the local name creationdate.  </s>
<s> Nowhere does the XML Namespaces Recommendation say that you will get anything interesting or useful by concatenating the URI and the local name.  </s>
<s> The fact that "dav:creationdate" is a fine URI is completely irrelevant from the perspective of the XML Namespaces Rec to the issue of whether "dav:" is a legal namespace identifier.  </s>
<s> I don't think the issue is anything to do with whether URIs are hierarchical.  </s>
<s> From reading your message, the requirements appear to be as follows: - DAV wants to identify elements by a URI not a URI/local name pair - DAV wants the generated URI for an element D:creationdate/ to be dav:creationdate - DAV to generate the URI that identifies an element from the namespace identifier and local name You might think that these requirements imply that the namespace identifier for DAV must be "dav:", but in fact they don't, because there is no requirement that the method that you use to generate the URI that identifies an element is to concatenate the namespace identifier and the local name or the element.  </s>
<s> You can solve the problem simply by choosing some other method of generating the URI, which allows the namespace identifier to be a legal URI, as required by the XML Namespaces Rec. James  </s>
