<s> Hi all, I would like to congradulate the WebDAV working group on the much improved WebDAV specification.  </s>
<s> It is cleaner and more organized than previous versions.  </s>
<s> With that, there are a few errors that I noticed in some of the status codes where the codes conflict with existing HTTP 1.1 status codes.  </s>
<s> WebDAV status codeHTTP status code 207 Multi-Status207 Partial update OK 418 Unprocessable Entity418 Reauthentication Required 419 Insufficient Space on419 Proxy Reauthentication Required Resource  </s>
<s> Also, in Section 8.2.4, one of the status codes returned is "405 Conflict" although status code 405 is supposed to mean "Method Not Allowed".  </s>
<s> It should be changed to "409 Conflict" or "405 Method Not Allowed".  </s>
<s> \\Marc Eaddy  </s>
<s> Mark, Thank you for reading the specification, and for pointing out this status code conflict.  </s>
<s> We based the status codes on the rev-00 version of the HTTP spec., and submitted our -05 specification before the rev-01 HTTP version was submitted.  </s>
<s> But, since obviously the HTTP working group has first dibs on the status code name space, we'll definitely have to change the status codes in the -06 revision of the WebDAV specification.  </s>
<s> Also, I noticed that the PEP draft, which is being recommended for experimental, uses the 420 and 421 status codes, so we'll rewrite the draft around these as well.  </s>
<s> Conflict"  </s>
<s> Yeah, this is a bug -- it should be 409 Conflict.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I think Jim already responded to this, but either way, thanks for pointing this out.  </s>
<s> They will, of course, be fixed in the next release.  </s>
