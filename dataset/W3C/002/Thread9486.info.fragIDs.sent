<s> o The WG notes that the RDF/XML syntax as currently defined is unable to represent an arbritary RDF graph.  </s>
<s> In particular, the RDF/XML syntax cannot fully represent a bNode which is the object of more than one statement.  </s>
<s> o The WG believes that extending the RDF/XML syntax so that it can respresent all RDF graphs is beyond the scope of its current charter and resolves to postpone consideration of this issue.  </s>
<s> o The WG actions the editor of the RDF Syntax WD to include in that document a clear statement of the RDF graph structures that RDF/XML is unable to represent.  </s>
<s> See: 13: Issue: rdfms-assertion Propose: The WG resolves that o the RDF model theory defines the semantics of RDF o it is beyond the scope of this WG to decide on how the laws of different countries should apply to statements made in RDF.  </s>
<s> o this issue be closed.  </s>
<s> See: 14: Issue rdfms-boolean-valued-properties Propose: o The WG notes that rdf:type can be used in place of the rdf:is suggested in this issue.  </s>
<s> Thus, to say that a resource is a chocolateLover, the class ChocolateLover can be defined, and the resource declared to be a member of that class using rdf:type.  </s>
<s> rdf:isNot can be represented by declaring the resource to be a member of the class of NotAChocolateLover, again using rdf:type.  </s>

<s> See: 16: Issue rdfms-aboutEach Propose o the WG resolves to remove rdf:aboutEach from the language on the grounds - it is not used - it is not widely implemented - it has confusing interactions with bagID as recorded in - it prohibits the development of streaming RDF/XML parsers - it requires schema processing in the parser - this is the wrong layer in which to implemenent such functionality o Action DaveB remove from the grammar in the RDF/XML document o Action Brian update the issues list, especially Attention Developers 17: Datatypes Take a straw poll of the WG's views on the various datatype proposals and discuss how to proceed See: 18: Semantics of Reification - what progress This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant  </s>
<s> fine up to here; these names are purely syntactic, and I'm happy to have their syntax limited this way...  </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to go there.  </s>
<s> The nice thing about container decisions to date is that rdf:Bag etc. are *not* special syntax; they're just logical constants.  </s>
<s> I can live with it, though.  </s>
<s> yes, please.  </s>
<s> rdf:li is syntax as well.  </s>
<s> Again, please: no. rdf:_nnn is a logical constant, not special syntax.  </s>

<s> Hands up all who aren't here!)... Yes, the maillist is becoming a huge time-consuming effort.  </s>
<s> Brian once advised that those of us with limited time for W3C duties should be selective but the recent flood has been such a monolithic lump, two or three threads but almost all on one extended (and vital) subject, that, frankly, it takes as long to be selective as not.  </s>
<s> Besides, I haven't wanted to miss any of it!  </s>
<s> This sub-group's capacity for never-ending argument and counter-argument has amused, impressed and dismayed me in turns.  </s>
<s> I just don't know how to handle it, personally - as a WG member.  </s>
<s> How can one contribute without adding more centrifugal forces?  </s>
<s> To agree with one viewpoint is to invite a counter-example from the other camp - and always a very valid one.  </s>
<s> I don't sense any gravitational centre upon which these orbiting bodies will eventually converge, one I can add my mass to.  </s>
<s> Many's the time I thought about chipping in (like `Who says shoe sizes are integers anyway?') but have thought better of it - it'd only cause trouble.  </s>
<s> Speaking pragmatically (as an RDF-based-software programmer), I cannot (yet) see a way to justifying expressing a preference and if I did, I can't see it helping to contain the argument.  </s>
<s> (Though Pat's brain dump got very close to clarifying it for me - until it got pulled apart...) Help me out, chaps.  </s>
<s> I honestly think it's been damned impressive but not efficient for this WG member.  </s>

<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Thanks for the improvement.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to accept DanC's suggestion that we should not syntactically restrict the use of rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt and rdf:Seq.  </s>
<s> I also noticed that I'd left out rdf:RDF, rdf:li and rdf:aboutEach from the list of reserved names.  </s>
<s> Did I miss any more; DaveB you have a list somewhere.  </s>
<s> I wonder if we can simplify it all to: o Resolves that the use of qnames rdf:RDF, rdf:ID, rdf:about, rdf:resource, rdf:bagID, rdf:parseType, rdf:aboutEach and rdf:li except as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error.  </s>
<s> We also have the case of names not in the name space.  </s>
<s> Should the parser barf if it meets a property or a typed node like rdf:foo?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Any reasonable parser will barf.  </s>
<s> It is unlikely that the user intended to write what they did write.  </s>
<s> If the WG decide that this is not permitted then the barf will be an error, otherwise the barf will be a warning.  </s>
