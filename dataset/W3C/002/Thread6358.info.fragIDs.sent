<s> Why does the W3C Hompage not use Portable Network Graphics, or Scalable Vector Graphics?  </s>
<s> Using its own image recommendations should be equally-important as its mark-up recommendations (such as XHTML).  </s>

<s> Hi Matthew, We do have PNG graphics available for the icons.  </s>
<s> The format you get depends on what our server and your client agree on  </s>
<s> (we make both PNG and GIF available, and probably will  </s>
<s> add SVG as the number of SVG clients grows).  </s>
<s> In fact, I believe our server is configured to suggest PNG first, then GIF. - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> As far as images are concerned, our server serves the formats with the following qualities: - image/svg (0.85) - image/jpeg (0.8) - image/png (0.7) - image/gif (0.5) - image/tiff (0.001) The W3C logo is therefore served preferably as PNG if the client requests it.  </s>
<s> I agree that we should provide an SVG version too.  </s>
