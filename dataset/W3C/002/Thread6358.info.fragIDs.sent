Why does the W3C Hompage not use Portable Network Graphics, or Scalable Vector Graphics? 
Using its own image recommendations should be equally-important as its mark-up recommendations (such as XHTML).

Hi Matthew, We do have PNG graphics available for the icons. 
The format you get depends on what our server and your client agree on 
(we make both PNG and GIF available, and probably will 
add SVG as the number of SVG clients grows). 
In fact, I believe our server is configured to suggest PNG first, then GIF. - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 
As far as images are concerned, our server serves the formats with the following qualities: - image/svg (0.85) - image/jpeg (0.8) - image/png (0.7) - image/gif (0.5) - image/tiff (0.001) The W3C logo is therefore served preferably as PNG if the client requests it. 
I agree that we should provide an SVG version too.
