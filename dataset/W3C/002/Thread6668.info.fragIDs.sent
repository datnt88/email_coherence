Dear, I am developing my thesis based on documents publication with access control. 
Could you indicate or send me informations of what technology is used by W3C, please (DB, ACL, XACL,....) ?

Hi Carla, I'm including Eric Prud'hommeaux on this reply since I believe he is the person who has been largely responsible 
for our access control system. 
Eric, do you have any references on how our ACLs work?

sure, but they're meager: I just went through and added some pointers to other docs at the bottom. 
The system is designed to be general to any organization -- the scripts and apache modules have no innate knowledge of the W3C structure. 
I'd be interested to see it used elsewhere and see what needs to be adjusted to do so. 
Have fun and let me know if you need anything.
