<s> I recently upgrade my installation to the latest version of Tidy (I use the Cygwin platform for which Tidy compiles OOTB).  </s>
<s> I've found that: (1) The blank lines that used to be inserted to make the markup more readable before hN tags, p , tr etc aren't any more.  </s>
<s> (2) td &amp;nbsp; /td is converted to td /td Is there a configuration option that affects the insertion of blank lines for the former?  </s>
<s> The latter I consider to be a bug.  </s>
<s> It certainly causes me pain because I can't then feed it into htmldoc (http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/ - I had to use a td font color="white" - /font /td , not pretty at all).  </s>
<s> Tidy has served me well for years until these recent changes.  </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to point out exactly where the changes came in, but there doesn't seem to be a change log maintained.  </s>

<s> Hi Phil,  </s>
<s> On #1, that was a consensus decision.  </s>
<s> We all like some whitespace for readability, but that was wide agreement that enough is enough.  </s>
<s> You can't please everyone, no matter how hard you try.  </s>
<s> But #2 comes as a surprise.  </s>
<s> Empty table cells usually look weird - with or  </s>
<s> without styles.  </s>
<s> Can you log a bug?  </s>
<s> Go to http://tidy.sf.net/ and follow the link to the bug tracker.  </s>
<s> thanks, Charlie  </s>
<s> Can't argue with that logic.  </s>
<s> Ideally I'd like it as a config option, since when I'm creating a web site I want minimalist and when I'm writing a document I like whitespace - but then there's the danger of too many options.  </s>
<s> Is there a change log somewhere that I've missed?  </s>
<s> At least then awkward folk like me could decide whether or not they want to upgrade based on the features/fixes.  </s>
<s> or  </s>
<s> Done, testcase included.  </s>
<s> I wasn't sure whether it was a parser issue or a pretty printer one - I couldn't spot anything obvious in pprint.c,  </s>
<s> but then again I didn't have very long to spend on it.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Phil  </s>
<s> No, but there should be.  </s>
<s> We are pretty good about commenting our CVS checkins, so it should be possible to generate one from CVS logs.  </s>
<s> No one has gotten that creative yet, however.  </s>
<s> Does anyone one have a shell/perl script to do this they would like to share?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> The category isn't too important.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
