The quota draft was very briefly discussed in the WG meeting in Atlanta. 
The first open issue were how to define "quota" so that it could be flexible enough for many different implementations yet still simple enough for clients to easily use. 
The attendees favoured some kind of 
language like "quota is the maximum storage available to the current 
user in the current collection". 
This gives the quota enough context that both user-based quota systems and collection-based quota systems can represent quota with a single number. 
The second open issue was whether to rename the property names from "*-bytes" to "*-octets". 
The consensus of the attendees was not to bother. 
(I still don't have complete notes from the meeting but did scribble down this and some other notes myself).

If attendees did not bother, but IETF does, it seems it would best to change term term to "octets". 
I still think "octets" is more accurate and that is a good reason to use "octets" instead of "bytes".

I agree, but at the very least a footnote should define bytes as 8-bit bytes... 
It seems trivial, but I'd wager that at least one implementation will be saved a lot of headache by this simple definition.

I'd be very surprised if anyone has shipped an implementation using the "*-bytes" property names yet (I know Apple hasn't because we're waiting for a consensus on the issues), so this is probably the best time to make a name change.
