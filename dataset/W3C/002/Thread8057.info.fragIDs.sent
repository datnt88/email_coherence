<s> Ladies and Gentleman, At the WebDAV interop fest, we saw that some servers weren't doing the right thing when clients send them owner tags on a LOCK request.  </s>
<s> When doing a LOCK a client can put in XML in the owner tag, and this XML often times has namespaces prefixes in it.  </s>
<s> So we have something like... LOCK When the server returns this owner tag on a lockdiscovery, it has to also return the definition of the MyNS namespace in the owner tags or clients will choke on not recognizing MyNS prefix.  </s>
<s> Having to keep track of prefix mappings when parsing the LOCK body is an added piece of complexity that servers don't really need.  </s>
<s> It would be better if we could require (or more likely strongly encourage) clients to make any XML inside the owner tag work standalone, i.e. forcing them to define any namespaces they use there.  </s>
<s> They would send something like this on a LOCK.  </s>
<s> This way the server could just keep a copy of the data between the owner tags without any extra processing.  </s>
<s> Steps to increase interop: 1. Server implementers should be aware of this and code accordingly.  </s>
<s> A number of servers at the WebDAV interop fest only copied the data between owner tags, not doing the extra name space processing.  </s>
<s> 2. We should say something to the effect that clients SHOULD send self-contained XML data with all the namespaces prefixes they used defined between the owner tags to workaround servers that don't handle this correctly.  </s>
<s> 3. We should practice what we preach in the spec.  </s>
<s> For instance in RFC 2518 example 8.10.8,  </s>
<s> we have D:href inside an owner tag that could cause certain servers to have the problem described here.  </s>
<s> 4. We should keep general scenario in mind when writing specs in the future that involve one party saving XML with namespace tags in it from another party, possibly saying that the client MUST send self-contained XML.  </s>
<s> Alas, since RFC 2518 is a done-deal there's not much we can do on #3. Issues #1 and #2 are mostly education issues for WebDAV client and server implementers.  </s>
<s> The main reason I'm writing this is for #4, so that we can be aware of this scenario in the future.  </s>
<s> Thank you, John Spaith Software Design Engineer Windows CE Microsoft  </s>
<s> 1) References to RFC2616 References have been updated to point to RFC2616 rather than RFC2068, but it seems that all (most?) section numbers still need to be updated.  </s>
<s> 2) Section 4.4 Replace "MUST not" by "MUST NOT" 3) Section 4.6 I think this section needs to be deleted (it refers to the source link stuff) 4) Section 6.3, p1 Replace "A lock token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lockdiscovery property in the response body, and can also be found through lock discovery on a resource."  </s>
<s> by "A lock token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lock-token header of the response, and can also be found through lock discovery on a resource" 5) Section 6.3, p3 Replace "However resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the uniqueness requirements."  </s>

<s> All DAV compliant clients and resources MUST use XML parsers that are compliant with [REC-XML].  </s>
<s> All XML used in either requests or responses MUST be, at minimum, well formed.  </s>

<s> I don't understand this requirement.  </s>
<s> If a body isn't defined, it should be ignored, right?  </s>
<s> 8) Section 8.1, p3 (required headers) "Note that HTTP 1.1 requires the Date header in all responses."  </s>
<s> - not true - clockless origin servers are treated as a special case "WebDAV servers MUST support ETags correctly and MUST return the ETag header in all GET and PUT responses.  </s>
<s> " - strong disagreement (see separate thread on the mailing list) 9) Section 8.2 "URLs for collections appearing in the results MUST end in a '/' character." - I don't think we have consensus on this.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, this section seems to attempt to define a subset of relative URI resolution -- I think this is a VERY bad idea.  </s>
<s> Clients should properly resolve URIs against the request URI -- if we must, we can simplify this requirement by restricting the set of allowed relative URIs to those starting with an absolute path.  </s>

<s> Also: the example for propfind/allprop is missing.  </s>
<s> 11) Section 8.3 "All DAV compliant resources MUST support the PROPPATCH method and MUST process instructions that are specified using the propertyupdate, set, and remove XML elements of the DAV schema" - What is the "DAV schema"???  </s>
<s> Also, replace "Instruction processing MUST occur in the order instructions are received (i.e., from top to bottom)" by "Instruction processing MUST occur in document order" (standard XML processing term) 12) Section 8.7 Replace "If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status), and the errored resourceAs URL MUST appear with the specific error."  </s>

<s> 15) Section 8.11, Locking unmapped URLs "A server MUST respond successfully to a GET request to an empty resource, either by using a 204 No Content response, or by using 200 OK with a Content-Length header indicating zero length and an server-determined Content-Type."  </s>
<s> Do not mention the content type at all.  </s>
<s> No content type is fine as well.  </s>
<s> 16) Section 8.11.2 Replace "Lock-Token: ( opaquelocktoken:e71d4fae-5dec-22d6-fea5-00a0c91e6be4 )" by "Lock-Token: opaquelocktoken:e71d4fae-5dec-22d6-fea5-00a0c91e6be4 " 17) Section 8.12 Replace "A successful response to an UNLOCK method does not mean that the resource is unlocked."  </s>
<s> by "A successful response to an UNLOCK method does not mean that there are no locks left on the resource."  </s>

<s> 30) Section 14.7 "A change in a property SHOULD NOT cause the last-modified date to change, because clients MAY rely on the last-modified date to know when to overwrite the existing body."  </s>
<s> I think this is a new requirement that hasn't been discussed.  </s>
<s> BTW: it's inconsistent with the attempt to make ETags a MUST -- if you have Etags, you don't have to rely on the last modified date anyway.  </s>
<s> 31) Section 18.6, Reduction of Security due to Source Link can be removed 32) Section 19, IANA consideration (old text) "URIs are used for both names, for several reasons.  </s>
<s> Assignment of a URI does not require a request to a central naming authority, and hence allow WebDAV property names and XML elements to be quickly defined by any WebDAV user or application.  </s>
<s> URIs also provide a unique address space, ensuring that the distributed users of WebDAV will not have collisions among the property names and XML elements they create" This is wrong.  </s>
<s> Properties are NOT identified by URIs.  </s>

<s> See http://www.webdav.org/wg/rfcdev/issues.htm  </s>
<s> I believe that in general we need to distinguish what the spec should say to allow for client/server interop, and what a "interop guide" should say about interoperating with poorly implemented clients or servers.  </s>
<s> For this particular thread, a client should be able to send legal XML, especially since the client will often be using a generic XML parsing/unparsing package that doesn't have provisions for "replicating" namespace declarations within certain nodes.  </s>
<s> So I agree with suggestion 1 (i.e. servers should handle this case correctly), and disagree with suggestions 2, 3, and 4. To emphasize, I'm happy to have an "interop guide" document that tells a client about this particular server bug, and how to workaround it, but I would object to placing this language/advice in the protocol.  </s>
<s> A client should not be forced to work around server bugs (although it of course is free to do so), and the spec should not be made more complex or harder to implement just to provide interoperability with buggy servers.  </s>
