I have just submitted draft 04, which can also be obtained via the issues list at Please note that all issues have been fixed or closed. 
If you'd like to raise a new issue or reopen an old one, please do so within the next two weeks. 
If no significant changes are required, it will be sent to IESG for last call.

I have just submitted draft 05, which can also be obtained via the issues list at It is time to stick a fork in this revision. 
Unless a significant flaw is encountered, I have no intentions of submitting another draft prior to IESG review -- editorial issues, if any, can be handled by the RFC editor or dealt with the next time we need to revise. 
We need to spend the next two weeks gathering test cases and implementation reports, prior to submission to the IESG. 
Larry, do we have a suitable template for describing implementations?

I have begun updating the test cases and adding reports to If you have a URI syntax implementation (client, server, whatever), please test it for consistency with the given test cases (and any other tests that you wish to come up with based on draft 05) and send the results to this list.

I have created a testing page at http://www.w3.org/2004/04/uri-rel-test.html to make (manual) testing of the implementations in various browsers easy. 
I have used this page to test Amaya (my version, compiled from CVS 
checkout on 2004-01-04). 
I don't know whether (or to what extent) processing is done by Amaya or by libwww. 
Here are the results: All tests are passed, except the following: # rel correct Amaya 6 //g http://g http://g/ (additional slash) 7 ?y 
http://a/b/c/d;p?y 
http://a/b/c/?y (d;p removed) 9 #s http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s 
{testpage URI}#s 15 http://a/b/c/d;p?q 
not testable (cursor cannot be placed in empty field) 43 g. 
http://a/b/c/g. 
http://a/b/c/g (dot removed) 51 ./../g http://a/b/g http://a/b/c/g (/c not removed) 55 g;x=1/./y 
http://a/b/c/g;x=1/y http://a/b/c/g;x=1/./y (precedence of ; over /) 56 g;x=1/../y http://a/b/c/y http://a/b/c/g;x=1/../y (precedence of ; over /) For test 71, Amaya uses strict parsing. 
Hope this helps. 
Regards, Martin. 
Is there some reason you didn't use the test page I provided? 
Or is the link to it simply too obscure? 
Note that this is just the relative resolution tests, so far. 
Thanks for the reports.
