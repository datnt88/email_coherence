<s> Participants: David, Amy, Jonathan, Philippe, Sanjiva (late) Regrets: Umit Missing: Gudge Agenda: - MEPs vs IOPs document - Use cases that accentuate the trade-offs between using MEPs versus IOPs - How MEPs would be indicated in bindings - Amy's suggested use cases Topic: MEPs vs IOPs document David: one of my intent was to use this as a basis for the work in the TF. Jonathan: would then be involved in the report?  </s>
<s> David: yes.  </s>
<s> other comments about it?  </s>
<s> showed the correspondence between IOPs and MEPs.  </s>
<s> try to isolate the difference implications of IOPs vs MEPs.  </s>
<s> Jonathan: ok, so the document differentiate clearly IOPs and MEPs. the question is whether or not the difference needs to be exposed at the abstract level in WSDL. is this addressed in this document?  </s>
<s> David: no but it enumerates the pros and cons.  </s>
<s> in order to highlight those, I have the use cases section.  </s>
<s> we have a couple of use cases for the moment.  </s>
<s> didn't do the pros and cons yet.  </s>
<s> Amy: what happening is the question of how much semantic constraint is in WSDL.  </s>
<s> interactions with protocol capabilities.  </s>
<s> one thing would be to consider proposing to create an interface based on IOPs, then take some protocols to express those.  </s>
<s> ACTION: Amy to generate an example of an interface defined in terms of an abstract IOP, with two different protocols binding that as *different* MEPs.  </s>
<s> Jonathan: is it possible to define one WSDL with IOPs/MEPs and bind that to a request-response case and something which is not req-resp.  </s>
<s> David: other use cases might demonstrate that it is useful to model MEPs at the abstract level.  </s>
<s> other missing thing: some clear understanding of if the information is not available at the interface level, how would it be at the binding level?  </s>
<s> Amy: what we did in Scottsdale was to provide a set of definitions, which was used to draw the original WSDL draft.  </s>
<s> sequence, directionality, cardinality and fault.  </s>
<s> but nothing else.  </s>
<s> nothing about the interesting MEP http://www.w3.org/2003/03/An_interesting_MEP.html  </s>
<s> Amy: it would be useful to figure out what else do we need (requirements, clauses) to allow to say: this is a MEP and IOP.  </s>
<s> "what makes a MEP?" David: there is an arch definition and a soap definition.  </s>
<s> Amy: there is also the question of direct specification of faults in the patterns.  </s>
<s> [Sanjiva joins] Amy: any message may trigger a fault or a fault may be substitute at any message in the pattern after the first one.  </s>
<s> Philippe: if you have (out)+, you can't expect a fault in the middle.  </s>
<s> Amy: disagree.  </s>
<s> you can have a service that send a fault in the middle.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: comment on the MEP part someone from IBM looked at it and had no clue what is was talking about.  </s>
<s> pictures would be helpful.  </s>
<s> David: in other words, he is expecting MEP and what is currently described are IOPs.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: the cardinality question came up.  </s>
<s> Jonathan: the current MEP part represents the statu quo. the output of this TF will probably influence it.  </s>
<s> Philippe: In my mind, WSDL described an interaction between a client and a service.  </s>
<s> If try to represent IOPs it may be more than just another client the service is interacting with.  </s>
<s> What use would it be for a client to know that the service is interacting with another client?  </s>
<s> Amy: It's important for Pub-Sub.  </s>
<s> It's important to know that others may be subscribing to it.  </s>
<s> It's important to each client to know that there are other clients in competition.  </s>
<s> Philippe: It would be relevant at the abstract level to know, but at the binding level it doesn't change anything.  </s>
<s> Amy: Generally in terms of Pub-Sub, the client simply subscribes.  </s>
<s> There is a subscriber, and 0 or more publishers.  </s>
<s> David: the point of view is really a separate issue.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: but it affects the language.  </s>
<s> what I need in WSDL is what the client needs to know.  </s>
<s> pick up the WSDL and use the service.  </s>
<s> you can document a contract between 2 parties using BEPL... David: [clarifying] looking at the purpose of the WSDL is to ensure that the parties that will interact are in agreement on how they interact.  </s>
<s> the point of view is not important, at the abstract part.  </s>
<s> Amy: you're leaving power dynamic.  </s>
<s> it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract.  </s>
<s> it is a contract between a service and its correspondents.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: WSDL may not care if more than 2 parties are involved.  </s>
<s> David: do we have agreement that WSDL represents the contract between interacting parties?  </s>
<s> Philippe: 2 parties... Amy: disagree.  </s>
<s> but we have one service.  </s>
<s> David: no, in UC1, BigCo wants to interact with its suppliers.  </s>
<s> the WSDL is given to the suppliers.  </s>
<s> the suppliers implement the service: abstract part of the WSDLs are the same.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: there is no single contract between the 2. David: 2 completed WSDL in this case.  </s>
<s> for the complete WSDL, there is one service.  </s>
<s> the abstract part can be implemented by more than one service.  </s>
<s> Philippe: do you envision bigCo asking for the suppliers to use broadcast-type IOPs?  </s>
<s> David: it doesn't preclude to do so.  </s>
<s> Amy: it's a contract in a sense of a software license.  </s>
<s> problems with the term "contract".  </s>
<s> it's a set of requirements.  </s>
<s> David: so, should we use "requirements"?  </s>
<s> "take-it-or-leave-it" contract?  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: WSDL describes what the service can do from its point of view.  </s>
<s> Amy: disagreement is that the contract is between 2. WSDL describes one server and any number of correspondents.  </s>
<s> we have a fair amount of agreement that we have a contract offered by the service, without negotiations.  </s>
<s> describe the contract between the service and each of its correspondents.  </s>
<s> David: at the interface level, it may well applied to multiple services.  </s>
<s> Philippe: when we model the web, we don't "care" that we can reproduce 10 millions of time the interaction between the client and the service.  </s>
<s> Amy: [...] David: at the abstract level, we can either model using IOPs or using MEPs.  </s>
<s> there is more information using MEPs.  </s>
<s> I'll add a section for recommendations at the end following Amy's suggestion.  </s>
<s> Amy: seems that Sanjiva would like to make something out of our recommendations: make it stronger, or replace it.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: I'd like to understand why we don't document MEPs instead of IOPs in the MEPs part.  </s>
<s> David: at the f2f, it became clear that the group had misunderstanding on the Scottsdale consensus.  </s>
<s> and the group said that there is an important need for at least a req-resp MEP.  </s>
<s> Amy: I would argue that there was no enough understanding of the restricted definition for patterns.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: to document your MEP, I can document that using a choreography language.  </s>
<s> we should not go there.  </s>
<s> Amy: so we should restrict at IOP? Sanjiva: no 2 parties only.  </s>
<s> David: so it's MEP?  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: the first picture (in David's mesage) identifies the parties, that should be leave to choreography.  </s>
<s> David: would like Sanjiva to come up with a use case regarding the advantages of IOPs and disadvantages MEPs.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: I believe that documenting the MEP would be more functional that documenting the IOP.  </s>
<s> However, I don't believe that's in scope for WS-Desc.  </s>
<s> (where "that" refers to MEP) Amy: if I understand Sanjiva: there is a point in the MEP at which it becomes choreography, rather than WSDL.  </s>
<s> Sanjiva: fundamental misunderstanding of terminology here :( Amy: agree.  </s>
<s> David: anybody can make suggestion of things that are misunderstood to the list.  </s>
<s> Next teleconference: This Wednesday.  </s>
