<s> [ Moved over from xml-encryption@w3.org (Donald, your other post is there too) ] I agree with dropping it.  </s>
<s> If mgmtdata is to be used in a proprietary way, then better that people must define their own proprietary element to do the job.  </s>
<s> Merlin r/dee3@torque.pothole.com/2001.05.30/12:42:12  </s>
<s> The MgmtData element has no defined internal structure and is just described as providing in-band key distribution related information such as encrypted key or key agreement information.  </s>
<s> This is clearly not interoperable without further definition.  </s>
<s> In the XML Encryption WG, EncryptedKey and AgreementMethod elements are being defined which offer interoperabile ways to do these things.  </s>
<s> Given this, is there any reason to keep MgmtData in the standard?  </s>
<s> If there is someone using it, it could be moved to the additional URIs draft.  </s>
<s> In any case, I believe its use should be deprecated and use of the potentially interoperable methods being defined in the XML Encryption WG encouraged.  </s>

<s> Joseph and I have talked abou this and we want to minimize changes in the namespace at this point.  </s>
<s> So our conclusion is to retain MgmtData and its syntax but to change the explanatory text for it to something like "Use of this elemet is NOT RECOMMENDED.  </s>
<s> It provides a syntactic hook where in-band key distribution or agreement data can be placed.  </s>
<s> However, superior interoperable child elements of KeyInfo for the transmission of encrypted keys and for key agreement are being specified by the W3C XML Encryption Working Group and they should be used instead of MgmtData."  </s>
<s> Thanks, Donald PS: It also appears that PGPData and SPKIData can be treated as syntactic hooks and retained without the demonstration of specific interoperability.  </s>
