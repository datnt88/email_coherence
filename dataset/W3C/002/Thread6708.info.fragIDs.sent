<s> The cause is the shorthand div element around line 104.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem to have a use since there's no "hpmt" class in the stylesheet.  </s>
<s> It should be removed or replaced by a its longhand version: div class="hpmt" /div Best regards, Patrick Benny w3@chipple.org  </s>
<s> Bjoern and Patrick, An empty testing div was added on Wednesday that stymied at least IE Windows/Mac, Opera and Safari.  </s>
<s> It was changed to div class="hpmt" /div for now.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your screen shot and diagnosis.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/  </s>
