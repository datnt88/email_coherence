<s> Anders said ... IMHO the leveling approach is often appeling but when used in the context of agreeements, real life more complex than that.  </s>
<s> I like to think in terms of topology or formation.  </s>
<s> I also like to separate agreements from specifications.  </s>
<s> DB I agree that life *can* be more complex than that.  </s>
<s> However the problem with complexity is that it makes successful interoperability to achieve.  </s>
<s> I therefore think it should be a goal to have a limited number of options that a "leveled" approach would facilitate.  </s>

<s> * A specification is a collection specification components that one or more authors have created (possibly with copyright) The authors sign the specification with an "Authenticity of Origin" signature.  </s>
<s> Which means the authors does not obligate themself to use the spec and is not responsible for usage by others.  </s>
<s> DB I like this idea, but the specification is not the implementation.  </s>
<s> Do you also need a signature or certification that some software follows the specification.  </s>
<s> However doing this might result in some liability issues perhaps.  </s>
<s> /DB  </s>
<s> * An Agreement contains agreement components and is signed by parties that obligate themself to the semantics specified by the agreement components.  </s>
<s> DB I agree, but the fewer the agreement components the better for ease of implementation and interoperability.  </s>
<s> This probably means that each agreement has to be larger in scope.  </s>
<s> /DB  </s>
<s> I believe that desctinctions like these are important otherwise we never know what the signature means.  </s>
<s> Reuse almost always involve specifications, even on an industry level.  </s>
<s> So the an agreement topology is the art of relating agreements, specification and parts thereof, ie. references, appendix, include, govern, govern with superiority etc.  </s>
<s> Here I also see benefits from using the notion of Specifciations as containers of components which may or may not be related.  </s>
<s> WSDL is component, Chorograpghy is a components, W3C XML Schema is a component.  </s>
<s> A Choreography is bound (static, dynamically) to a syntax specific InformationSpecification such as XML Schema.  </s>
<s> DB As well as an agreement specifying the specifications that are being followed, should it also specify the bits of the specification that are NOT being followed.  </s>
<s> So really the aggreement is a combination of aggregation and restriction.  </s>
<s> I think that restriction is sometimes really necessary, as WS-I has demonstrated, in order to get interoperability.  </s>
<s> You might also find that two specifications actually conflict in some way and therefore you need to say which of the two you are actually following.  </s>

<s> Anders Having taken a quick look at the document you attached, it seems to me that really it describes a legal framework that identifies how businesses would interact.  </s>
<s> It does not necessarily specify the detail of how they would interact.  </s>
<s> Yes, the "top" are general provisions which sometime may be difficult or impossible to correctly represent in electronic form other than as text.  </s>
<s> The UBAC work were doing covers simple textual agrement to complext eContracts.  </s>
<s> This with an approach that we start simple with textual clauses and work our way toward semantically rich,executable and computer interpretable agreement components.  </s>
<s> I am also wondering what your thoughts are about separating agreements into three levels: 1. Technology agreements that cover messaging, technical protocols, security, etc  </s>
<s> Seems resonable , these are often call technical addendums.  </s>
<s> 2. Process and data agreements that cover the choreography and data to be used, and  </s>
<s> Seems resonable.  </s>
<s> 3. Business agreements that specify how individual parties will interact.  </s>
<s> Seems resonable of you by interact include that parties are obligated to ..., have the right to...., is prohibited from....  </s>
<s> I think that technology agreements could be developed that could be used by multiple industries, and process and data agreements could be developed for individual industries and that the Business agreements could link the two together for use in a particular instance.  </s>

<s> Selecting/prioritizes a number of AgreementTypes is certainly important.  </s>

<s> A loosely coupled certification process is probably better.  </s>
<s> Yes, Creating AgreementComponents in resonable sized chunks is very important.  </s>

<s> In UBAC we have also on the agenda to discuss constraints to be used when constructing an agreement.  </s>
