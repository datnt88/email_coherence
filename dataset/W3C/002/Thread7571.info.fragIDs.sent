<s> Jeff, Regarding support from Major Vendors, so far I haven't seen any formal Product announcements, however if you check the authors of the documents, and the folks participating on the mailing list (check the archive at quite widespread involvement.  </s>

<s> 4.0 Resource Kit included an prototype implementation based on an earlier version of the spec.  </s>
<s> Regarding your second question, I think you will find that HTTP/1.1 servers typically have good support for the basic HTTP 1.1 methods.  </s>
<s> I hope we will see excelent support for the DAV methods too.  </s>
<s> And finally, regarding your third question, I feel that tunneling WebDAV on top of HTTP is unnecessary as well as counter productive.  </s>
<s> From one point of view, WebDAV isn't really a new protocol, and is rather a set of HTTP extensions.  </s>
<s> HTTP has an excelent framework for extensions, and there is no reason why the "basic infrastructure" needs to change to support the new  </s>

<s> As a matter of fact I have tested implementing simple DAV support via CGIs, and ISAPIs on several servers (IIS 4.0, Apache, etc).  </s>
