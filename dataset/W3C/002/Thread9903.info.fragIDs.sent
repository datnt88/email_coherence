<s> I don't know if this is going to be helpful, but I thought it worth the attempt to pull together the datatyping discussion.  </s>
<s> I've been through todays mail traffic and pulled the issues as I've recognised them.  </s>
<s> In general I've ignored retoric, exposition of beliefs as to how it *should* be done and tried to focus on issues that I can, in some sense make concrete.  </s>
<s> I've also tried to be even handed.  </s>
<s> The result is no doubt imperfect; so help me get it right, next time round.  </s>
<s> Issue B1:  </s>
<s> In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g.  </s>
<s> mary age "10" .  </s>
<s> age rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> and mary ageD _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a xsd:integer.map  </s>
<s> "10" .  </s>
<s> two properties have to be used, age and ageD , in this example.  </s>
<s> I believe there is a agreement that this is a difference between the two proposals.  </s>
<s> Indeed, it may be said that the main aim of TDL is to avoid requiring different properties for these different idioms.  </s>
<s> Does anyone in the WG consider this feature of S, on its own, to be a "can't live with" issue with S?  </s>
<s> Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value: _:i xsd:double "10.1" .  </s>
<s> _:i xsd:double.de  </s>
<s> "10,1" .  </s>
<s> I believe there is agreement that S-A allows this.  </s>
<s> Does anyone in the WG consider this, on its own, to be a "can't live with" issue with S?  </s>
<s> Issue B3: the "duh" issue DanC is concerened that with TDL: mary haircolor "red" .  </s>
<s> and a rule: ?x  </s>
<s> haircolor "red" = ?x  </s>
<s> rdf:type redhead .  </s>
<s> one cannot conclude mary rdf:type rdfhead .  </s>
<s> since one conclude that both "red"'s denote the same thing.  </s>
<s> Jeremy has responded:  </s>
<s> From: mary haircolor "red" .  </s>
<s> haircolor rdfs:range xsd:string .  </s>
<s> and the same rule one can draw the required inference.  </s>
<s> DanC: Does that solve the problem?  </s>
<s> Do you withdraw that objection?  </s>
<s> Jeremy/Patrick: Do you accept that without the range constraint, DanC is  </s>
<s> correct?  </s>
<s> Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code This is similar to B2. I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.  </s>
<s> Consider the graph: _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title "10" .  </s>
<s> mary age "10" .  </s>
<s> Given a query: (?x dc:Title ?y)  </s>
<s> &amp; (?z age ?y)  </s>
<s> existing applications will return: ?x  </s>
<s> = _:f, ?y  </s>
<s> = "10", ?z  </s>
<s> = mary Under TDL, they would return null.  </s>
<s> Sergey: Does this version of the issue illustrate your point?  </s>
<s> Jeremy/Patrick: Do you accept this analysis; would the query return null  </s>
<s> under TDL?  </s>
<s> Issue B5: Storage Requirements TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.  </s>
<s> Jeremy/Patrick: do you accept this statement?  </s>
<s> Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered datatype datatype.lex  </s>
<s> datatype.val  </s>
<s> datatype.map  </s>
<s> Sergey: Do you agree this is the case?  </s>
<s> If not, how many URI's are  </s>
<s> required to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.  </s>
<s> I think the killer issue for TDL is self-entailment (Dan's "duh" test).  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> have been following with interest to see if Jeremy can come up with a  </s>
<s> workable MT for this: his comments about treating literals like existentials sounded as if it had promise.  </s>
<s> But, lacking a plausible MT proposal by next telecon I do wonder if we don't need to just go with S, because I've not seen any convincing fundamental problem with it...  </s>
<s> I agree with the assessment.  </s>
<s> It's not ideal, but so far seems to be standing up better than the alternatives.  </s>
<s> I'd say that is a strong plus.  </s>
<s> I am persuaded by Dan's argument, especially about self entailment.  </s>
<s> I think the above is a consequence of that simple requirement.  </s>
<s> I don't see this (query case) as a decider, either way.  </s>
<s> I suspect it only breaks existing code for poorly conceived queries (find me a value that is both a title and an age).  </s>
<s> No comment.  </s>
<s> Nit: I'd say that 3 rather than 4 URIs are required: datatype.lex  </s>
<s> datatype.val  </s>
<s> datatype.map  </s>
<s> It would be nice if they weren't, but I don't see this as a big problem.  </s>

<s> This message addresses the main criticisms of TDL.  </s>
<s> I will follow up with more detail concerning query, Brian's B3 &amp; B4.  </s>
<s> The proponents of S furnish us with an implementation of S, and a model theory for S (which includes, naturally self-entailment).  </s>
<s> I now can create an implementation of TDL in the following fashion.  </s>
<s> As I read in any RDF graph I apply the following syntactic transformation.  </s>
<s> Match: ?x  </s>
<s> ?y  </s>
<s> ?z where ?y  </s>
<s> != rdf:value and ?z a literal node replace with ?x ?y  </s>
<s> NewNode NewNode rdf:value ?z where NewNode is a newly minted bNode.  </s>
<s> For example: a foo "ss" . is transformed to a foo _:b.  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:value "ss".  </s>
<s> We then use the S implementation and S model theory (idiom S-P is the only idiom used).  </s>
<s> Hence: If S is implementable then so is TDL  </s>
<s> The maximum overhead required for TDL is the same as that for S idiom A  </s>
<s> and/or S idiom P. All problems to do with entailment, query, implication, etc. are clarified and addressed with this process (as long as they are clear and addressed with S).  </s>
<s> From an implementators point of view, it is clearly easier to implement the  </s>
<s> syntactic transformation and S-P, than to implement S-A, S-B and S-P.  </s>
<s> Graham, does this adequately address your concern about self-entailment?  </s>
<s> [Small technical detail: S-P uses a closed world assumption on data types, whereas TDL uses an open  </s>
<s> world assumption.  </s>
<s> The two can be made equivalent by using S-P with at least  </s>
<s> two incompatible types in its closed world both having domain being the complete set of unicode strings.  </s>
<s> Two such types are: xsd:string = {  x, x  | for any unicode string x } appendA = {  x, x."A"  | for any unicode string, .  </s>
<s> being string concatenation } Jeremy  </s>
<s> Jeremy, as far as I can tell, you are proposing:  </s>
<s> (a) start with datatyping scheme S, complete with its model theory (significantly, a literal denotes exactly the corresponding string).  </s>
<s> (b) avoid subgraphs of the form a foo "ss" .  </s>
<s> by preprocessing them into a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:value "ss" .  </s>
<s> I think this does address the self-entailment problem.  </s>
<s> But I think that adding the requirement for graph transformation will be a different kind of show stopper, in that lots of deployed software will see a foo "ss" .  </s>
<s> and generate a graph containing exactly one arc.  </s>
<s> I'm puzzled by this:  </s>
<s> I don't think an RDF implementation has to do anything special to process S-A, S-B and S-P that isn't standard RDF handling.  </s>
<s> Without any extension to core RDF, I could define a vocabulary+interpretation that models these idioms, giving them their intended interpretation, so what's special here for the RDF processor?  </s>

<s> Jeremy, feel free to correct me if you disagree ;-)  </s>
<s> I see the recent refinement of TDL as an attempt to provide tidy literals to those who want them without loosing the untidyness that is inherent in the context dependent interpretation of literals.  </s>
<s> It was an attempt at a fusion of TDL and S-P, in the interest of finding a common ground and reaching a mutually acceptable solution.  </s>
<s> As Jeremy has said to me so elegantly, "there's untidyness in there somewhere", and I agree.  </s>
<s> You're either going to have untidy literal nodes or untidy bnodes with literals hanging off them.  </s>
<s> There's no way around that.  </s>
<s> If it turns out that the "manditory bnode" idiom is going to be highly backwards incompatable (and I'm not saying it is), cest la vie, then we are stuck with untidy literal nodes, and back to the previous TDL model.  </s>
<s> The only show stopper that has been claimed for TDL is that it doesn't have tidy literals -- based on the view  </s>
<s> that e.g. "1984" always means the same thing.  </s>
<s> I hope that  </s>
<s> it has become clear that this view is not valid in an environment of global interchange between disparate sources of knowledge.  </s>
<s> So it should be concluded that there are no show stoppers for TDL.  </s>
<s> You may not love TDL for stylistic or other esthetic reasons, but I feel that all supposed "fatal" flaws with TDL have been addressed.  </s>
<s> I don't feel the same is true for S, as my comments to Brian's summary outline.  </s>
<s> Let me state for the record that I am not religiously tied to TDL.  </s>
<s> If S can be refined so that what I see as unacceptable shortcomings are eradicated, then great.  </s>
<s> It's not a matter of ego or advocacy -- but about having a solution that will address all of the desiderada in as general, efficient, and compatable a way possible.  </s>
<s> So, that said, I still await someone to address the issues of compatability of local and global idioms and idiom specific vocabularies.  </s>

<s> I find this completely non sequitur.  </s>
<s> If any show stopper can be removed by introduction of a different show stopper, that doesn't mean there are no show stoppers.  </s>
<s> I am still open to a TDL proposal that actually works.  </s>
<s> From a stylistic viewpoint, I can agree that it is neater.  </s>
<s> Yes, I tend to agree, too.  </s>
<s> In a sense, I think that what S does is push the resolution of that untidiness out into the application (where implicit as well as explicit typing information can be brought to bear).  </s>
<s> If the untidiness cannot be resolved adequately within the interpretation of RDF then that seems a reasonable, even inevitable, route to resolution of the problem.  </s>
