<s> E-mail actually has some advantages over HTTP in some circumstances: 1) Email penetrates firewalls, virtually everywhere, allowing kinds and types of collaboration that would be difficult without it.  </s>
<s> 2) Email is a "batch mode" type of interaction much better suited to laptops and situations without permanent IP connectivity.  </s>
<s> It is also better suited to certain types of automated updates done by tools, which then don't rely on the server being up to do (certain parts of) their work.  </s>
<s> The interesting question is not whether there are advantages, but how big they are, and how difficult it is to support both types of interactions.  </s>
<s> It is also possible that the e-mail interface could be defined in terms of an email= HTTP gateway scenario, such that mail messages could then become HTTP operations.  </s>
<s> Such a transformation could be defined in terms of a MIME type, and be an From:"Alan Robertson" alanr@bell-labs.com  </s>

<s> For many 'remote operations' it makes sense to have an 'operation' media type which is POSTed to the resource that performs that operation, whether the operation is located by "http" or "mailto".  </s>
<s> However, this issue was debated at great length in early WEBDAV history, and there was no interest in taking it on.  </s>

<s> If you want to encapsulate HTTP POSTs in an email message, send a message with message/http content-type.  </s>

<s> I suppose we need to know).  </s>
<s> It seems that way to me too.  </s>
<s> We should not gratuitously preclude email access (I suspect we will be able to use it eventually at TCE), but I don't think we need to devote a lot of attention to it right now (except enough so that we don't preclude email access).  </s>
