<s> Has independent interoperability been demonstrated with RFC2518 shared locks?  </s>
<s> If you believe it has been, what are the clients and servers with which it was demonstrated?  </s>

<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> Our server passes the tests in the Litmus test (as does moddav, I think),  </s>
<s> but I'm not aware of any client actually requesting shared locks...  </s>

<s> Regarding the interoperabiltiy of shared locks: I've done a few tests and found the following problems with IIS 5.0 (posted here so that it's gets archived and assigned a URL :-): 1) When reporting shared locks, IIS inserts one DAV:lockdiscovery element for *each* shared lock into the DAV:prop element.  </s>
<s> This is plain wrong, because each DAV: property can only have a single value (maybe the spec should clarify this in an example?). 2) When UNLOCKing shared locks, it seems that IIS sometimes removes the wrong lock (you have lock tokens "a", "b" and "c", remove "a", and upon a new PROPFIND, "a" and "b" are reported).  </s>
<s> Shared locks in moddav seem to work as expected (as far as my own tests are concerned).  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> Frank, have you tested interoperability of shared locks with the Xythos Sharemation server?  </s>
<s> What servers have you been able to create shared locks on?  </s>
<s> We'd only need one more interoperable client to be able to keep shared locks as we go forward.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> Lisa -  </s>
<s> as far as I know, GoLive wasn't even able to connect to the Xythos server during the last interoperability test (Oct 2001).  </s>
<s> But I know, we're able to set shared locks on IIS and Apache (mod_dav).  </s>
<s> Is there any solution/workflow implemented upon shared locks?  </s>
<s> Currently we're using the exclusive locking scheme only, even within our new workgroup system in GoLive 6.  </s>
<s> So, our Adobe Web Workgroup Server doesn't support shared locks either.  </s>
<s> Best, Frank  </s>
