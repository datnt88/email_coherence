I was on the hook to review section 2.3 (Meaning). 
Basically, this section reflects (accurately!) the fact that it was written by different people at different times. 
I don't think some of the points are going to come across very well, but I don't see the need to delay publication of the WD (assuming the WG agrees to do that) on this account. 
I DO think that a rewrite is needed before last call, however (I'm sorry I didn't have time to provide some suggestions here; maybe later). 
I think sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 are fairly clear, although the use of "assertion" in 2.3.2 needs some clarification. 
In particular, the last sentence of paragraph 1 of 2.3.2 says "which distinguish assertions from other uses (e.g. citations, denals [sic] or illustrations)." 
And the last sentence says: "A media type, application/rdf+xml is being registered for indicating the use of RDF/XML as an assertional representation in this way". 
2.3.1 says that each triple makes a distinct assertion (unqualified, i.e., all triples are assertions), while 2.3.2 apparently uses "assertion" to mean a real, honest-to-goodness, assertion, as distinct from, say, an illustration. 
So in 2.3.2, some triples are apparently *not* "assertions". 
An 
illustration in 2.3.2 is something like an "assertion" (according to 2.3.1 usage) in a particular context where it should be interpreted differently. 
I think this is going to confuse people. 
The text in section 2.3.3 
I think is too involved to get its points across compared to the preceding sections, and mixes those points up too much. 
There seem to be two points covered (the section title only covers one of them): (a) that what is asserted by an RDF graph consists not only of the triples that are explicitly there, but also the triples that can be logically inferred from the graph (i.e., there is a formal logical inference process that can be applied, which determines additional *formal* meaning, and this is independent of any social meaning that may be assigned to either the original graph, or the inferred graph) (b) that there is a social meaning that can/will be associated with the graph, and with the inferences. 
[Note that the notion of "inference" is introduced here without explanation.] 
2.3.4 seems to make a mixture of points that seem to be at least touched on in the earlier sections, and probably could be merged with them. 
In general, it's not always clear what we intend the readers to take away with them after having read this. 
It seems to me a way forward to clear this up would be to simply list what points we want to get across in simple, individual sentences, and then write some text to cover them.

Re: ACTION 2002-08-23#7, FrankM: Propose alternative text for the concepts and abstract model document to rectify concerns with conflicting use of "assertion". 
To state the problem: The last sentence but one of Section 2.3.1 says "The RDF model theory treats RDF as a simple assertional language, in which each triple makes a distinct assertion...". 
The last sentence of the first para of Section 2.3.2 says "A combination of social (e.g. legal) and technical machinery (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) provide the contexts that fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary of some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other uses (e.g. citations, denals or illustrations)." 
It seems to me someone might read the first bit as saying "all triples are assertions" and the second bit as saying "some triples are not assertions" (e.g., "denals" [sic]), and then wonder what's going on. 
The main problem is that the first bit (taken from the model theory) is taken out of context, since there are a number of caveats elsewhere in the model theory, e.g., "This only applies to uses of RDF that are intended to be the assertion of simple propositional content." 
Here's my suggestion: basically, add some stuff to the beginning of the first paragraph so it reads something like: 2.3.2 Social meaning While the formal semantics of an RDF statement (triple) is that of a distinct assertion, individual RDF statements may have a social meaning that is partly determined by the circumstances in which they are used. 
For example, in English, a statement "I don't believe that 'George is a clown' is true" contains the statement "George is a clown" and, considering only that statement, "George is a clown" is a distinct assertion. 
However, considering the whole sentence, this wouldn't be considered an "assertion" (in the socially-understood sense of that word) that "George is a clown". 
Similarly, a collection of RDF statements could be specified in a circumstance in which the social meaning was that they were not "assertions", but rather falsehoods (e.g., a collection of RDF statements describing a web page entitled "famous Internet myths"). 
At the same time, however, it is important to understand that RDF/XML documents, i.e. encodings of RDF graphs, *can* be used to make representations of claims or assertions about the 'real' world. 
RDF graphs may be asserted to be true, and such an assertion should be understood to carry the same social import and responsibilities as an assertion in any other format (including an assertion in a natural language document such as a contract). 
A combination of social (e.g. legal) and technical machinery (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) provide the contexts that fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary of some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other uses (e.g. citations, denials or illustrations). 
On looking again, I also have a problem with the second paragraph, i.e., the one that says: "For example, a media type, application/rdf+xml [RDF-MIME-TYPE ] is being registered for indicating the use of RDF/XML that might be published with the intent of being such an assertional representation (as distinguished from other XML or text that may just happen to look like RDF assertions)." 
The way this whole paragraph follows the first one, it suggests that the media type will distinguish between uses of RDF that are intended to be assertions, and uses of RDF that have other meanings "(e.g., citations, denials, or illustrations)". 
Then the parenthetical remark at the end comes along: "(as distinguished from other XML or text that may just happen to look like RDF assertions)", which suggests that this is a purely technical issue, to disambiguate RDF from text that might "happen to look like RDF assertions". 
I'm not sure this is the same thing. 
What I suspect this is saying is that someone might publish RDF statements in RDF/XML with the intention that these be interpreted as *other* than assertions (e.g., denials), and that some other media type will be used to indicate that; the media type application/rdf+xml is reserved for RDF/XML that is not only RDF/XML, but is intended to represent "real assertions". 
I suppose you can use the media type that way if you want to, but I would argue that characterizing RDF/XML published with the deliberate intent of representing a bunch of denials as "other XML or text that just happens to look like RDF assertions" is highly misleading. 
If what I suspect you to mean is what you *really* mean, it would be clearer to state explicitly that the media type is to distinguish RDF intended to be interpreted as assertions in the social sense from RDF intended to be interpreted in some other way. 
(I know there was some discussion at the telecon about the media type business, but I missed whether it covered this particular issue or not).
