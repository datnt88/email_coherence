<s> With ARP I found three more tests that fit into our current framework useful.  </s>
<s> These are attached.  </s>
<s> Two empty-property-element ones have a property element with just a processing instruction and just a comment in.  </s>
<s> An id-and-about one showing to give an rdf:about complementing the rdf:ID in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf (assuming rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt is updated to be correct).  </s>
<s> I could add them to our test repository for consideration if people want.  </s>

<s> test017.nt in I have added: test3.rdf  </s>
<s> test3.nt in about/ I have modifed the Manifest.rdf  </s>
<s> file in both of these directories (was that the right thing to do).  </s>
<s> They include the new tests.  </s>
<s> I also added a test:issue and a test:description to the PENDING test2.rdf in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about.  </s>
<s> I also modified test2.rdf and test2.nt in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about to conform with the WG decisions on non-Ascii characters in URIs.  </s>
<s> I have modified the file Overview.html in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about since I have just noticed that it does not give access to the new tests when navigating by directory.  </s>
<s> I also deleted the heading "Resolution" in this file, since it is misleading; the actual resolution appears to be: "The new syntax WD resolves this issue."  </s>
