<s> I suggest the following as an improved but by no means final Security Considerations section of the Signature Syntax and Processing document.  </s>
<s> Security Considerations The XML digital signature standard provides a very flexible mechanism.  </s>
<s> In designing a system to make use of it, due consideration should be given to the threat model being defended against and to the factors covered in the subsections below.  </s>
<s> Only What is Signed is Secure The flexible Transformations mechanism, including canonicalization and explicit  </s>
<s> filtering and extraction, permit securing only a subset of data in an object.  </s>
<s> This is good for many applications where a limited portion of an object must  </s>
<s> change after the signature or different signatures secure different parts or the  </s>
<s> application modifies aspects of the object that are not significant and can be  </s>
<s> omitted from signature coverage or the like.  </s>
<s> Keep in mind that whenever this  </s>
<s> is done, those aspects that are not signed can be arbitrarily modified and the  </s>
<s> signature will still validate.  </s>
<s> Only What is "Seen" Should be Signed If signing is intended to convey the judgment or consent of an automated mechanism or person concerning some information, then it is normally necessary  </s>
<s> to secure as exactly as possible the information that was presented to that  </s>
<s> mechanism or person.  </s>
<s> Note that this can be accomplished by literally signing  </s>
<s> what was presented, for example the screen images shown a user.  </s>
<s> However, this  </s>
<s> may result in data which it is difficult for subsequent software to manipulate.  </s>
<s> It can be effective instead to secure the full data along with whatever filters,  </s>
<s> style sheets, or the like were used to control the part of the information that  </s>
<s> was presented.  </s>
<s> Check the Security Model This standard specifies public key signatures and secret key keyed hash authentication codes.  </s>
<s> These have substantially different security models.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it permits user specified additions which may have other models.  </s>
<s> With public key signatures, any number of parties can hold the public key and verify signatures while only the parties with the secret key can create signatures.  </s>
<s> The number of holders of the secret key should be minimized and preferably be one.  </s>
<s> Confidence by verifiers in the public key they are using and its binding to the entity or capabilities represented by the corresponding secret key is an important issue, usually addressed by certificate or on line authority systems.  </s>
<s> Keyed hash authentication codes, based on secret keys, are typically much more efficient in terms of the computational effort required but have the characteristic that all verifiers need to have possession of the same key as the signer.  </s>
<s> Thus any verifier can forge signatures.  </s>
<s> This standard permits user provided signature algorithms and keying information designators.  </s>
<s> Such user provided algorithms may have further different security models.  </s>
<s> For example, methods involving biometrics usually depend on a "key" which is a physical characteristic of the user and thus can not be changed the way public or secret keys can be and may have other security model differences.  </s>
<s> Algorithms, Key Lengths, Etc.  </s>
<s> The strength of a particular signature depends on all links in the security chain.  </s>
<s> This includes the signature and digest algorithms used, the strength of the key generation [RFC 1750] and the size of the key, the security of key and certificate authentication and distribution mechanisms, protection of all cryptographic processing from hostile observation and tampering, etc.  </s>
<s> The security of an overall system would also depend on the security and integrity of its operating procedures, its personnel, and on the administrative enforcement of those procedures.  </s>
<s> The factors listed in this paragraph, while critical to the overall security of a system, are mostly beyond the scope of this document.  </s>

<s> Users should not be tricked into signing a native content that is transformed into something that the user would not have signed otherwise.  </s>
<s> This recommendation applied to transformations specified in the signature block, as well as transformations found within the document itself.  </s>
<s> @@@ The first sentence wrongly implies that it is the transform output that is being digitally signed when it is the original data and the transforms together that are being signed.  </s>
<s> This is a confusion between digital signing mechanism and some conception of human consent.  </s>
<s> @@@ The whole thing is way too document and human being oriented to my mind.  </s>
<s> What does "understand" mean?  </s>
<s> How can you ever tell if a person "understands" something without telepathy?  </s>
<s> The sentence "Users should not be tricked into signing a native content that is transformed into something that the user would not have signed otherwise."  </s>
<s> seems very confusing to me, contradicts the wrong first sentence by talking about signing "native" (i.e. original???) content.  </s>
<s> @@@ The user only ever signs the output of the transformations, that's all they see.  </s>
<s> So I don't understand this stuff about them signing the result of transformations into something they "would not have signed".  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it's really not about tricking the user, it's about implemention bugs or implementation maliciousness.  </s>
<s> The user only ever signs what they see, it is up to faithful software to record that fact.  </s>
<s> The admonition is against improperly designed or unfaithful software that incorrectly records the users signature.  </s>
<s> Little of this applies to protocol signatures as it is so obvious that the integrity of the whole parsing, transformation, programatic decision making, signing, etc., behaviour of the software as a whole is what is at issue.  </s>
<s> As for the final sentence, I think it is confusing in this document to call things like internally referenced style sheets in a document "transformations".  </s>
<s> We should reserve that word in this document for our Transformations element.  </s>
<s> And I think it is mystifying not to give any example of something in a document, like a style sheet, which effects what the user sees.  </s>
<s> Some people might see the kind of thing you are talking about right away and others might not have a clue what you mean by transformations in a document.  </s>
<s> @@@ My wording is not all that great, but I think it is better.  </s>
<s> I cover such cases as a signature added whose sole purpose is to time stamp.  </s>
<s> In such a signature, it is utterly immaterial what, if any, part of the data was understood.  </s>
<s> We are not yet at the stage of defining semantic tags where you can tell such things, but I assume we or someone else in the future will.  </s>
<s> But the wording you propose only makes sense if you assume certain siganture semantics.  </s>
