<s> Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates" as XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next version of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more general solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would like to use.  </s>

<s> See talog You can probably download the dtd file and map the FPI to this local file.  </s>
<s> If you're doing the validation in your own code, you can write an entity resolver that returns the DTD when it sees the public ID of "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" Hope this helps, Charles Reitzel Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates" as XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next version of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more general solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would like to use.  </s>
