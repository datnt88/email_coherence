Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates" as XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next version of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more general solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would like to use. 
I understand that Tidy is not a generic XML validator. 
Does anyone have pointers to good resources for validating an XML file for which I have a DTD? 
I recently took a look at James Clark's SP ... heavily technical, but I can use it. 
Or at least I could, if I could comprehend what's happening with the XHTML 1.1 DTDs ... Are these posted online as .dtd 
files? 
How do I reference them in a DOCTYPE line? 
I tried saving the "xhtml11.dtd" 
section of the spec as a local text file for validating against, but it contains all kinds of references to other online files, which don't seem to quite work the way I want them to ... What to do?

Hi Zac, 
I think you're on the right track w/ sp. 
Any validating XML parser should do the trick. 
You may, however, need to do a bit of work to get the parser 
to locate the DTD file based on the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) for XHTML 
1.1. 
The XHTML 1.1 spec includes an SGML CATALOG for this purpose. 
As an SGML parse, I'll bet a nickel that sp supports catalogs. 
See talog You can probably download the dtd file and map the FPI to this local file. 
If you're doing the validation in your own code, you can write an entity resolver that returns the DTD when it sees the public ID of "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" Hope this helps, Charles Reitzel Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates" as XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next version of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more general solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would like to use.

You'd win that bet. 
The problem is locating the *actual* DTD files themselves, outside of an appendix to the spec (W3C recommendation). 
I did eventually get SP (nsgmls) working by using the xhtml11.dtd 
URL listed in an example from Section 2 of the XHTML 1.1 recommendation. 
I just found it odd that there were no links to the actual .dtd 
URLs anywhere in the spec ... the catalog references a file "xhtml11-flat.dtd" ... I couldn't find that one except by guessing what the location must be. 
I'm only 90% sure that I'm linking to the right URL. 
Now that I have the link, though, SP is very useful for validating my code. 
I'm surprised that I haven't seen it integrated into editors, like Tidy is. 
I'm thinking that it might be nice to have it linked into Tidy! 
But I suppose you can run SP on Tidy's output with some pretty basic redirection.

Retraction: Expat doesn't validate (I knew that). 
I use XML::Checker from Perl on a regular bases, which is layered over Expat. 
Xerces/C++ and GNOME libxml are validating libs.
