Hello fellow DAV people... webdav.org is intended to be a central resource for the DAV community. 
It contains my DAV FAQ, a list of relevant specifications, some papers about DAV, useful links, and a list of DAV projects. 
For people who wish to be an editor/maintainer for a section of the site, I am quite willing to provide DAV access (of course! 
:-). 
Jim Whitehead will be managing the Working Group area on webdav.org, using Joe Orton's sitecopy tool. 
webdav.org is also available for hosting projects (web pages and a distribution point) and mailing lists with an associated web archive. 
Please contact me if you would like to host your DAV-related project and/or mailing list at webdav.org. 
Lastly, if you simply have suggestions for some content, then please feel free to email me. 
I hope everyone will find webdav.org 
useful! 
Cheers, -g

Thank you Greg for taking the lead in producing the webdav.org 
site! 
I think it's a great step forward in bridging the gap between the community of protocol developers within the IETF working group, and the rapidly emerging development and user communities. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to call for volunteers to help Greg, both to help out with the webdav.org 
site, and also to assist in the development of mod_dav, the Apache WebDAV module. 
In my view, having both healthy open source and commercial development communities is crucial to the adoption of WebDAV by a broad audience. 
So, * if you're a programmer, and could spare some time to work on or test mod_dav functionality * if you're a Web site designer, and want to work on webdav.org 
* if you're a programmer in languages such as Java, C, C++, Python, Tcl and others, and you'd like to develop an API for WebDAV for that language * you have a great idea for a WebDAV application, and want to work with others to make it a reality * if there's an existing project (like Joe Orton's sitecopy, or UCI's WebDAV Explorer) that you'd like to help work on then... 
I heartily encourage you to get in contact with Greg Stein greg@lyra.org 
, or myself ejw@ics.uci.edu , so we can put you in contact with others who are interested in the same thing, and so we can get your interest or project up on webdav.org. 
Many hands *do* make light work, and right now as interest in WebDAV is ramping up, your individual contributions can make a big difference.

Great news! 
We are currently working on DAV support for Zope, our open source web object publishing environment. 
I hope to have a prototype that includes at least basic class 1 support ready soon so that we can get into interoperability testing. 
Synergy with Apache is important to us as many Zope users run one or more Zope installations in the url namespaces of their existing Apache servers, so we'll definitely be putting some time into testing peaceful co-existence with mod_dav. 
Let me know if there are particular things we can do to help the mod_dav effort on this front. 
Once I have the prototype ready, we'd be happy to put an installation on webdav.org for folks to beat on and test against. 
I'll also work on getting a overview of Zope WebDAV support up on the www.zope.org 
site that can be listed in webdav.org's 
projects area.
