TO:w3c-dist-auth@w3.org Does anyone know if it's possible to configure the Ms office 2000 applications and ms webfolders to use webdav properties instead of just embed them in the document ?

I do not believe this is possible -- Office 2000 properties appear to be exclusively embedded within the document. 
An intelligent server that has knowledge of the Office data formats might be able to extract the properties and expose them via DAV, but I know of no server (including MS's) that does this. - Jim 
I suppose Office 2000 uses OLE Persistent Property Sets for storing the properties within the document.

Such a server would be interesting for documents created using many other Windows based applications as well. 
OLE defines a standard seialized data format for property sets called "Structured Storage Serialized Property Set Format". 
A Windows NT based server could use StgOpenStorageEx and get the IPropertySetStorage/IPropertyStorage interfaces to access the properties. 
Any other server could directly access the properties using the published format.
