<s> Hi folks, A happy new year to all and welcome back.  </s>
<s> I hope you are doing better at swapping RDF context back in than I've been managing.  </s>
<s> This is the usual call for agenda items for this Friday's telecon.  </s>
<s> Please may I have suggestions by noon UK time, Thursday.  </s>
<s> I see we have some syntax issues to discuss.  </s>
<s> Graham, as I recall raised a question about the structure of the document set and there is still the question of datatypes.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I have another meeting scheduled for Friday... I hope I shall be available for the RDF teleconference, but in case I'm not please accept my apologies.  </s>

<s> There has been a call by Graham to finalize the Datatyping primer generally as-is with only the S idioms defined.  </s>
<s> I am calling for the inverse, for S to be removed from the primer and the P and D (DAML) idioms defined as the recommended/official idioms for global and local typing of literals.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need to have a brief discussion about this?  </s>
<s> (I do hope that Graham is able to make the concall...)  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> For the record, I didn't so much issue a "call" as "asked the question":  </s>
<s> For the rest of the group, my question is this: do we just tidy up the "S" proposal and go with it, or do we need to discuss the alternatives?  </s>
<s> I think proposal "S" works pretty well.  </s>
<s> (If the latter, we would need descriptions of the alternatives to match Sergey's section 4, in particular showing how they work with the model theory.)  </s>
<s> I don't object to discussion...  </s>
<s> So do I ;-) If I don't, I think I've said most of what I have to say in my response to you; in summary, by my understanding: - S does (or can) match current RDF usage and idiom, and - S does not require any difficult changes to the model theory #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
