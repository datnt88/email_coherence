Hi folks, A happy new year to all and welcome back. 
I hope you are doing better at swapping RDF context back in than I've been managing. 
This is the usual call for agenda items for this Friday's telecon. 
Please may I have suggestions by noon UK time, Thursday. 
I see we have some syntax issues to discuss. 
Graham, as I recall raised a question about the structure of the document set and there is still the question of datatypes.

I have another meeting scheduled for Friday... I hope I shall be available for the RDF teleconference, but in case I'm not please accept my apologies.

There has been a call by Graham to finalize the Datatyping primer generally as-is with only the S idioms defined. 
I am calling for the inverse, for S to be removed from the primer and the P and D (DAML) idioms defined as the recommended/official idioms for global and local typing of literals. 
Perhaps we need to have a brief discussion about this? 
(I do hope that Graham is able to make the concall...) 
Cheers, Patrick 
For the record, I didn't so much issue a "call" as "asked the question": 
For the rest of the group, my question is this: do we just tidy up the "S" proposal and go with it, or do we need to discuss the alternatives? 
I think proposal "S" works pretty well. 
(If the latter, we would need descriptions of the alternatives to match Sergey's section 4, in particular showing how they work with the model theory.) 
I don't object to discussion... 
So do I ;-) If I don't, I think I've said most of what I have to say in my response to you; in summary, by my understanding: - S does (or can) match current RDF usage and idiom, and - S does not require any difficult changes to the model theory #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com
