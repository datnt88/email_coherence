<s> The definition for Enveloping Signature seems too constraining.  </s>
<s> Current definition: The signature is over content found within the signature itself via an IDREF to an Object element.  </s>
<s> The Signature provides the root XML document element.  </s>
<s> It does not seem necessary to say that the content must be found with an IDREF.  </s>
<s> The Object element containing the content may be identified by a transform.  </s>
<s> Also, the enveloping signature need not provide the document root, though clearly that is the principal reason for the enveloping signature.Proposed  </s>
<s> definition: SIGNATURE, ENVELOPING: The signature is over content found within the signature itself in an Object element.  </s>
<s> The Object is typically identified by  </s>
<s> IDREF (though a transform could be used), and the enveloping Signature element is typically used to provide the root document element.  </s>
<s> The definition of detached signature also seems too constraining.  </s>
<s> Current definition: The signature is over external content identified via a URI.  </s>
<s> Cosequently, the signature is "detached" from the content it signs.  </s>
<s> The content external to the signature may be within the same document and hence identified either by IDREF or by a transform.  </s>
<s> A detached signature is very much like an enveloped signature (in construction) except that an enveloped signature includes the signature element as content.  </s>

<s> Consequently, the signature is "detached" from the content it signs.  </s>

<s> Ok, when I wrote these I was thinking if you used a URI to some other resource, it was obviously a detached signature, if it was in the same document it was either enveloped or enveloping: You are speaking of the case of Even though they are in the same document, I think I agree that the best match (instead of creating a new name for it) would be to call it a detached signature -- even though they appear in the same document.  </s>

<s> It should also be noted that, according to the current spec [1], a signature can be enveloping, enveloped and detached all at the same time.  </s>
<s> SignedInfo can have multiple References, some of which refer to enveloping Object elements in the Signature, some of which refer to elements outside of the signature and possible in other documents (detached), and some of which refer to an ancestor element of the signature (enveloped signature (signature is enveloped by content it signs)).  </s>

<s> The problem as I can see it is that we distinguish between signature types (enveloping, enveloped, detached), but a signature can be of more than one type at the same time.  </s>
<s> As an alternative approach, consider to label the types which a data entity to be signed could have, in relation to its signature:  </s>
<s> o A data entity can be EXTERNAL or INTERNAL in relation to the document holding the signature element o An INTERNAL data entity can be INSIDE or OUTSIDE in relation to the the signature element The advantage of this kind of labelling is that the attribute combinations o EXTERNAL, o INTERNAL-INSIDE and o INTERNAL-OUTSIDE are "exclusive-or", in contrast to (enveloping, enveloped, detached).  </s>

<s> Gregor, thanks for the comment.  </s>
<s> I sort of tried this approach when I realized the qualifier was sometimes referring to the signature, and sometimes to the data.  </s>
<s> However, it ended up leading to rather awkward grammatical constructs in the sentences of the spec.  </s>
