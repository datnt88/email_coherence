hello everyone, in my desperation, i did the following: I downloaded the html file and TidyGUI. 
I used TidyGUI to convert the html file to xml. 
the file could be converted with warnings. 
However, it could not be viewed as an XML file in explorer unless i delete the following heading from the document since TidyGUI could do it without the fatal error I mentioned, i am thinking that there must be a way to do it in jtidy. 
could someone give me a clear direction? 
i am using jtidy_r7_dev. 
thank you. 
best rgds ray 
Use "doctype: omit" in your options. 
See this page for a ref. on Tidy options: HTH, ..matthew

That's a DTD for HTML 4.0 Transition, and HTML 4.0 uses SGML, not XML. 
That's like trying to use a C header with a Fortran compiler. 
Use the DTD for XHTML 1.0, or possibly XHTML 1.1. 
Go to http://www.w3c.org/ and follow the HTML link on the left to find out about XHTML.
