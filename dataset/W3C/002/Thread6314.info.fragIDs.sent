Hi! 
The new design looks nice. 
But I'm surprised that XHTML Transitional is being used. 
I would have supposed that W3C would go for XHTML Strict. 
The design uses a layout table. 
I thought that was considered bad style. 
Is this really tabular data? 
If the window is made less wide than the logo plus the menu column, the menu disappears from view. 
That could have been prevented by placing the logo by itself at the top. 
Actually this kind of "problem" is seen a lot these days on many pages. 
One single image limits the possibilities of resizing the window. 
In your case it's not nearly as bad as in some other cases...

Hi Bertilo, 
We tried very hard to use CSS floats instead of a table, but the behavior across browsers was inconsistent and in some cases made the content inaccessible. 
Had the results been different across browsers but acceptable, we probably would have gone with floats. 
You are right, the data isn't tabular and we're using a table for layout. 
However, we made sure that the results made sense when "linearized" (e.g., when used with Lynx). 
We tried that design as well, then changed it to the current form in order to save a little space.

Hi 
This is possible to get working without causing problems -- my home page, IE5 and a single column for people using older browsers. 
This has all been done using CSS and it's XHTML strict and it's been tested using Lynx etc The CSS I used is all linked to as text files from here: 
It is also possible to get this layout working for Netscape 4 and IE4 but I decided not to bother as I would have had to go for XHTML transitional due to the hacks needed... However I guess you want non-CSS browsers to get the column layout... so no option but to use tables (yuck!).

Yes, but that involves browser sniffing (if I'm not mistaken). 
I didn't mention that one design constraint was "no browser sniffing".

Hi 
There is no browser sniffing on my site in terms of CSS :-) All browsers get the default style sheet (or another if they selected a different one using cookies) and then browsers that 
support @import (IE 4/5 and NN6) get an additional style sheet which sents some sizes using em's (this is to prevent IE3 doing daft things) and finally there is a third style sheet only used 
on the front page and this does the columns and it's called using @import as well so Netscape 4 won't get it. 
The only browser sniffing I have set up is a special message that Lynx users get! 
BTW this list archive is rather cool with all the Reply-to links set up to work really well :-)

Can you explain what that means: "or another if they have selected a different one using cookies"? 
This is absolutely browser sniffing: you are giving some clients content that others do not get (based on their known support for @import). 
Our style sheet has been designed to work across 
a number of browsers, but once we've decided that (and it's an all-too-small subset of the CSS specification) everyone gets the same style sheet. 
Well, the "trick" is nice to know, in any case. 
I'll tell our systems guys who do a great job. 
Thanks!

Hi Ian 
I'm using this perl script: http://www.vex.net/~gonzo/scripts/ to serve the CSS. 
I understood sniffing to mean detecting a user agent and then serving up different content to different ones... If using stuff that one knows is supported in one browser and not in others then just using CSS is sniffing as Netscape 3 doesn't support CSS... 
That means that you have use the first version of IE3 which supported CSS as your base-line -- yuck!! 
This might be worth looking at: I don't know what IE3 would make of it but it's a column layout that works in NN4 and IE4.
