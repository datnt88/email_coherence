<s> An updated summary of the datatyping issues, as I currently understand them.  </s>
<s> Issue B1: In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g. mary age "10" .  </s>
<s> age rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> and mary ageD _:a .  </s>
<s> _:a xsd:integer.map  </s>
<s> "10" .  </s>
<s> two properties have to be used, age and ageD , in this example.  </s>
<s> I believe there is a agreement that this is a difference between the two proposals.  </s>
<s> Indeed, it may be said that the main aim of TDL is to avoid requiring different properties for these different idioms.  </s>
<s> Can't Live With: PatrickS  </s>
<s> Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value: _:i xsd:double "10.1" .  </s>
<s> _:i xsd:double.de  </s>
<s> "10,1" .  </s>
<s> I believe there is agreement that S-A allows this.  </s>
<s> No-one has said this is a can't live with, so I'm proposing to drop this.  </s>
<s> Going ...  </s>
<s> Issue B3: the self entailment issue Withdrawn in favour of B4:  </s>
<s> From: [[I accept the reasoning above; it doesn't address my objection; it' just shows that my example wasn't very good.  </s>
<s> Sergey's example makes the point better:]]  </s>
<s> Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code This is similar to B3. I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.  </s>
<s> Under TDL, consider the graph: _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title (_, "10") .  </s>
<s> mary age (_, "10").  </s>
<s> Does this entail: _:x dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> _:z age ?y .  </s>
<s> I believe there is agreement that it does not under the current TDL model  </s>
<s> theory.  </s>
<s> It does entail: _:x dc:Title (_, ?y) .  </s>
<s> _:z age (_, ?y) .  </s>
<s> Can't Live With: DanC  </s>
<s> Jeremy: Updated model theory?  </s>
<s> Issue B5: Storage Requirements TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.  </s>
<s> This is disputed.  </s>
<s> Sergey: Do you accept that TDL's storage requirements aren't significantly worse than S's (e.g. given TDL can be transformed to S-P), and can therefore be dropped.  </s>
<s> Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered datatype datatype.lex  </s>
<s> datatype.val  </s>
<s> datatype.map  </s>
<s> Sergey: Do you agree this is the case?  </s>
<s> If not, how many URI's are required to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.  </s>
<s> Issue B7: Complexity S has too many ways of expressing the same thing.  </s>
<s> An RDF processor has to  </s>
<s> be aware of them all.  </s>
<s> Supported by Jeremy's error cases message  </s>
<s> and a message from Andy Seaborne to rdf comments: Issue B8: S-B encourages logically (sic) errors in the application type processing.  </s>
<s> Given: _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title "10" .  </s>
<s> mary age "10" .  </s>
<s> an application 'knows' that the range of age is an integer so it 'knows' that mary has age 10.  </s>
<s> Under S-B, running a query: ?x  </s>
<s> dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> ?z age ?y .  </s>
<s> will return ?x  </s>
<s> = _:f and ?z  </s>
<s> = mary , and knowing that the age of mary is 10, may conclude that the title of the film is also 10. Can't Live With: Jeremy  </s>
<s> I'm uncomfortable about withdrawing this.  </s>
<s> Dan used a different example for  </s>
<s> self-entailment prior to the one he withdrew: Does: http://www.w3.org/ dc:title "W3C".  </s>
<s> entail: http://www.w3.org/ dc:title "W3C".  </s>
<s> Intuitively, I think it is important that this is a valid entailment, and this hasn't been established yet for TDL.  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
<s> I think it would be useful for the group to make explicit what the ramifications of this are -- which should make it clear (I hope) why I cannot live with it.  </s>
<s> In order to use both S-A and S-B in the same knowledge base, or syndicate knowledge using either idiom into a merged knowledge base, we would have to have *two* variants of every metadata vocabulary: DC, PRISM, ONIX, MARC, vCard, etc. I.e. dcA:title and dcB:title and then relate the two together so that queries asking for dc:title would obtain knowledge expressed in either idiom.  </s>
<s> Ouch.  </s>
<s> Yuck.  </s>
<s> Blech.  </s>
<s> Insert your favorite expletive here _____ ;-) I just can't see the RDF community at large buying into such a scenario.  </s>
<s> And it is imperative that we support both global and local typing for literals, so the alternative -- choose only S-A or S-B is equally unacceptable.  </s>
<s> No. This is not correct.  </s>
<s> We just don't seem to be connecting  </s>
<s> on this one Brian.  </s>
<s> It is an issue of whether the query is based  </s>
<s> on string equality or value equality -- whether datatyping is taken into consideration.  </s>
<s> If we treat the parenthesized versions as TDL pairings (which I think is your intent) and use that as an indication of whether the query is string or value based then I think the results should become clear.  </s>
<s> Let me try to expand it to all significant cases: Case 1: (value comparison, no datatyping specified)  </s>
<s> _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title (_, "10") .  </s>
<s> mary age (_, "10").  </s>
<s> DOES entail _:x dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> _:z age ?y .  </s>
<s> (though probably should flag some warnings since  </s>
<s> the query is expecting datatypes as that is the  </s>
<s> basis for value comparison) Case 2: (string comparison, datatyping ignored) _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title "10" .  </s>
<s> mary age "10".  </s>
<s> DOES entail _:x dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> _:z age ?y .  </s>
<s> Case 3: (value comparison, datatyping defined) _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title (xsd:string, "10") .  </s>
<s> mary age (xsd:integer, "10").  </s>
<s> does NOT entail _:x dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> _:z age ?y .  </s>
<s> Case 4: (value comparison, datatyping partially defined) _:f rdf:type film .  </s>
<s> _:f dc:Title (_, "10") .  </s>
<s> mary age (xsd:integer, "10").  </s>
<s> does NOT entail _:x dc:Title ?y .  </s>
<s> _:z age ?y .  </s>
<s> (and as with case 1 should probably flag a warning due to the unspecified typing) Is that clearer now?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>

<s> I've just chatted to Jeremy, who tells me you and he have also talked this  </s>

<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Graham:  </s>
<s> Graham, I think the earlier B3 was only the redhead example, not the a document entails itself example.  </s>
<s> I would certainly support the addition of a new open issue with TDL in the "can't live with" class.  </s>
<s> Something like:  </s>
<s> Issue B?: TDL self-entailment In TDL a document does not entail itself.  </s>
<s> Cannot live with: Graham, Jeremy, DanC  </s>
<s> Without extra work on the TDL MT, this is a "cannot live with" against TDL.  </s>
<s> I was intending to work from the exisitential quantification of literals along the lines you sent me, but frankly if Pat can be persuaded to start  </s>
<s> with a clean sheet (or the P++ model theory) and come up with a better TDL  </s>
<s> model theory meeting his objections then we will all be happier (me especially).  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I responded to DanC on RDF-interest, RDF-logic I started from Dan's most recent version of the problem and concluded: "TDL is backwards compatible and S isn't."  </s>
<s> More to the point, on bended knee "Can't we just drop this one -- please, pretty, pretty please with a cherry on top?" we have done it to death.  </s>
