Hope this hasn't been asked/answered already, but... Let's say I want to delete an object, but I also want/need to create a new one to replace the deleted one. 
Due to some constraints in the system the delete and the create must be done within the same transaction - is there anyway to do this with the current level of support in WebDAV? 
It would seem like the need for a multi-part request should be fairly common.

Why not just lock the resource and overwrite it contents?

Because the old and the new resources are different resources. 
If, at some 
point in the future, someone asked for the 'old' resource by UUID I don't want 
it to be found.

I'm unclear on this scenario. 
Where did they get that UUID, and why would the old resource still be stored under it (or anywhere) after being overwritten? 
Are the old &amp; new at two separate http: URLs?
