<s> We've been using "dublin core" as an example of a kind of metadata.  </s>
<s> "Representing the Dublin Core within X.500, LDAP and CLDAP" not only is a useful document that shows how Dublin Core might be used  </s>
<s> for "document-like objects" which are closely aligned with things that might be authored distributedly, it's also a good source of references for other external representations.  </s>
<s> I think it would make a good addition to the WEBDAV home page.  </s>

<s> Good pointer, Larry.  </s>
<s> There is also a proposal in the works to extend PICS values (dropping the values are rational number restriction) specifically to be able to use PICS as a transfer syntax for Dublin Core -- and other -- metadata.  </s>

<s> Everyone should also be aware that the group that developed the Dublin Core has extended the model to include some transport concepts.  </s>
<s> The best discussion of this proposal can be found in the Dlib article that discusses the entire approach: The basic summary is that there should be things called containers that hold metadata of different types.  </s>
<s> Then there is some type of relationship entity that shows the relationships between different containers.  </s>
<s> One of the approaches uses MIME's multipart/related.  </s>
<s> In addition to the X.500/LDAP/CLDAP approach there is also the application/directory MIME type that the directory services folks are working on.  </s>
<s> For very flat and what I consider low overhead metadata this approach gives you the ability to handle community specific metadata to some degree as well as encodings and character sets.  </s>
<s> The application/directory stuff is described in: With all of this in mind I'm becoming increasingly worried that with so many parallel metadata transport/encoding methods that we may be fracturing a part of the infrastructure that desperately needs some commonality.  </s>
<s> While it is increasingly obvious that there is no concensus for an end-all-be-all metadata format there does seem to be concensus that they should be transported as MIME objects and that we should standardize on a few formats and schema (classes?)  </s>
<s> As far as WebDAV is concerned we should take a look at each of these current metadata proposals with an eye for how WebDAV can act as the primary seed for filling in each of these containers.  </s>
<s> Since WebDAV is currently the part of the infrastructure that is closest to the author then we should make the metadata formats as flexible as possible.  </s>
