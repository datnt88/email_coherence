<s> Khurram You obviously have a strong grasp of english, yet choose to use abbreviations which obscure the meaning of your message and make reading it difficult.  </s>
<s> Although punctuation may be too much to ask, consider full words.  </s>
<s> Then, it won't cause actual pain to try to read your message and you might get a response.  </s>
<s> d'u 0 what i mean?  </s>
<s> And hey... how about examples?  </s>
<s> Leave some samples of what you're trying to convert, what it looks like, what it *should* look like, and we can see where the tool is lacking.  </s>

<s> OK.  </s>
<s> What do you mean?  </s>
<s> Do you mean generic XML, or XHTML?  </s>
<s> Your "XML" looks suspiciously like HTML or XHTML.  </s>
<s> ... I'll take a guess -- your resultant filename is something like "myfile.xml", and there is no DOCTYPE declaration?  </s>
<s> If that's the case, what do you expect?  </s>
<s> Generic XML only knows about four "built-in" entities: , , , and &amp;amp;.  </s>
<s> Now you're throwing it one it's never heard of: &amp;nbsp;!  </s>
<s> You haven't been clear about what you're trying to do.  </s>
<s> *Why* have you given your file a .xml  </s>
<s> extension (if that's the case!)?  </s>
<s> What are you trying to do with it?  </s>
<s> If you really want it to be .xml, then make sure it references a DTD where nbsp is declared (like, say, one of the XHTML DTDs.  </s>
