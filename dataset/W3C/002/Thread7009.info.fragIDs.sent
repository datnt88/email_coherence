<s> Hi Patrick, I assume you knew you were stiring up a hornets nest, right?  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> I'm quite aware that the issues that are addressed in my IDs are areas of strong debate, yes.  </s>
<s> Being one of the people in the URI-IG that discussed the classical vs contemporay view (and an adherent of the contemporary view) I have to say that this way lies madness.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you missed the part that said that it is compatible with either the classical or contemporary view?  </s>
<s> Let me stress it again, draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00 is compatible with either the classical or contemporary view.  </s>
<s> If you read it without this understanding, I would encourage you to read it again.  </s>
<s> Most of the people on the URI-IG were involved in the original discussions about URIs when we had such animals as URA, URMs, URCs, URAv2, etc.  </s>
<s> The thing that has become clear is that a given URI's characteristics have more to do with how it is used than what its scheme says.  </s>
<s> Use and abuse are two different things.  </s>
<s> I assert that any use of a URI  </s>
<s> scheme contrary to the specified intended use is contrary to the very  </s>
<s> purpose of standards, and while research and advancement often need to bend the rules and try unconventional things, eventually, advancements  </s>
<s> and improvements need to be addressed in a standardized manner such that industry can build upon that knowledge in a consistent and reliable manner.  </s>
<s> For example, Dan uses the http scheme for pretty much everything.  </s>
<s> For him the http scheme makes a pretty valid urn-like thing.  </s>
<s> Others don't use it that way so it doesn't have those semantics for them and thus isn't one.  </s>
<s> IMO, a URI scheme defines, in addition to the syntax, a common semantics  </s>
<s> and basis for interpretation of instances of that scheme so that an application has at least half a clue what to do with such instances.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, let's all just use uuid: URIs and define the semantics in RDF.  </s>
<s> The one thing I do have a problem with is the inclusion of 'hrn:' along side 'urn:'.  </s>
<s> IMHO, since your 'hrn' proposal includes a domain-name it cannot be a URN because it is not persistent.  </s>
<s> The UUID version might but the domain-name based one isn't....  </s>
<s> You missed the essential point about my extended taxonomy and the definition of a URN -- that while a URN may embody within its representation the identity of the minting agent, it does not embody the identity of the resolution agent.  </s>
<s> URLs do both -- and in fact, the minting and resolution agents are the same.  </s>
<s> I suggest you re-read draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00, particularly section 3. An 'hrn:' may include the web authority of the minting agent, and that is persistent, as that will never change.  </s>
<s> Unlike a URL, however, that is *not* the resolution authority -- which like all URNs -- remains undefined in the URI itself.  </s>
<s> The 'hrn:' scheme provides a consistent, open, non-centralized URN scheme that does not need a dedicated centralized authority  </s>
<s> for granting namespaces, but uses web authority as that namespace and thus is far better suited for the Web, not having the bottleneck of namespace registration preventing global and mass minting of URNs.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the 'hrn:' URN scheme is a hierarchical URI scheme, which  </s>
<s> is highly desireable for many applications.  </s>
<s> By those two criteria, I consider the 'hrn:' URN scheme to be superior to the 'urn:' URN scheme -- though both are fully valid URN schemes in that neither refer to any resolution agency explicitly in their representation and are hence persistent in that regard.  </s>
<s> Beyond that the analysis is good from that point of view.  </s>
<s> The problem is getting agreement on it...  </s>
<s> Absolutely. Agreement about URI classes (or lack thereof) and URI semantics will be a long road, I think.  </s>
<s> But even though I'm coming late to this party, I think I've brought along some rather good music, and maybe we can all get into the same groove ;-)  </s>
<s> As mentioned above, I think that this statement is erroneous: "This URI scheme is also a type of URN, as defined by RFC 2396, but is not a namespace of the 'urn:' URI scheme [5], because the 'urn:' scheme does not provide for hierarchical characteristics which are central to the semantics of this URI scheme.  </s>
<s> " The fact that there is a domain-name in there means that it violates the persistence requirement in RFC 2396.  </s>
<s> But this persistence requirement has the rather narrow view that a web authority (domain name) only indicates a resolution agency, and that the URL-centric perspective perhaps precludes the broader role of a domain name representing only the minting agency, which even if that domain ceases to exist, remains historically valid and thus persistent -- within the scope of URN schemes which only attribute significance with regards to minting and not to resolution.  </s>
<s> This is an interesting one but I think you should pick another scheme name.  </s>
<s> The one you picked will end up causing you to much argument over the name and none over the merits of the idea.  </s>
<s> The one question I have is: is reification so globally well understood that it means the same thing to everyone?  </s>
<s> I've been out of the RDF discussions but I seem to remember this being an issue at one point....  </s>
<s> This URI scheme is specifically intended for use within RDF applications.  </s>
<s> And as for the name, it seems quite consistent with the URN/urn: convention ;-) After all, not all URNs are urn:'s.  </s>
<s> Likewise, not all URIs are uri:'s.  </s>
<s> But all urn:'s are URNs and all uri:'s are URIs.  </s>
<s> What is the merit of this over the 'data:' scheme?  </s>
<s> Specific, constrained semantics.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the 'data:' URI scheme requires that all datatypes be registered/defined as MIME types, which is an unnecessary overhead IMO for the kinds of datatypes in question.  </s>
<s> The 'tdl:' approach is that each datatype is denoted by a URI, and the pairing of datatype URI and lexical form uniquely identifies a member of the value space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> This is based on one proposal under consideration by the RDF Core Working Group for datatyping of literals in RDF.  </s>
<s> C.f. http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/TDL.html  </s>
<s> While the 'data:' URI scheme *could* be made to work for this application, it would be cumbersome.  </s>
<s> I can't figure out what this scheme has that doesn't already exist in current schemes.  </s>
<s> It seems that this one definitely falls into the "a URI's semantics have more to do with how you use it than what the scheme has in it"....  </s>
<s> Again, perhaps its significance is not seen because the distinction between URI classes as defined in draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00 section 3 is not fully understood.  </s>
<s> The key point is that a 'voc:' URI does not resolve to "something else".  </s>
<s> It is a URP.  </s>
<s> Yes, you could define a similar URI using 'http:' but it would never be clear whether it should or should not resolve to anything, and if so, to what.  </s>
<s> This is the basis for the classical view that I openly admit to subscribing to.  </s>
<s> The URI scheme lets an application know what it should or should do with a given URI.  </s>
<s> Using 'http:' URLs for everything just leaves the application guessing.  </s>
<s> The syntactic similarities between 'voc:' and 'http:' are due to both of them being hierarchical URI schemes and utilizing web authorities -- but their semantics are *very* different.  </s>
<s> Hmm.... I don't think a URI scheme can disclaim the URI Reference so the hash mark statement is false.  </s>
<s> Under the currently defined URI Class taxonomy, consisting only of URLs and URNs, no -- but under my extended URI taxonomy, with URPs, it can.  </s>
<s> And actually, since the definition of a URI Reference is based on the *returned* media type from dereferencing a URI, and if a given URI scheme is never intended to be dereferenced, then it is IMO valid and reasonable to state that in such cases a URI Reference is simply undefined (cannot exist, or is vacuous).  </s>
<s> This URI scheme has nothing to do with RDF/XML serialization.  </s>
<s> The utility of this URI scheme is to achieve intersection of knowledge in a 'tidy' RDF graph.  </s>
<s> "Constellations" of property/value pairs do not constitute equality in the eyes of RDF insofar as graph merging is concerned.  </s>
<s> A URI representation results in there being one and only one node in an RDF graph for each qualified name and allows one to make statements about that qualified name resource which are global to the knowledge base.  </s>
<s> I thought we'd fixed that whole XML namespace thing?  </s>
<s> 1. XML Namespaces still remain problemmatic in several areas, but that is a totally disjunct discussion that I won't introduce here to this forum, especially since it is not relevant to the 'xmlns:' URI scheme itself.  </s>
<s> 2. The 'xmlns:' URI Scheme does not replace XML NS declarations in XML instances.  </s>
<s> As with 'qname:' it provides a consistent representation for NS declarations in an RDF knowledge base (or anywhere else such a representation is useful).  </s>
<s> What's the difference between this and an 'http:' scheme?  </s>
<s> 1. It's a URV 2. It can be temporally qualified.  </s>
<s> 3. Its semantics are explicitly constrained to the representation of authoritative agents.  </s>
<s> Sorry if it sounds like I was picking it apart.  </s>
<s> No need for apologies, I wan't folks to pick them apart.  </s>
<s> That's how (a) they get better, and (b) how we achieve agreement.  </s>
<s> As I said, I know I'm coming late into these discussions (or have missed them entirely ;-) but I sincerely feel that the contemporary view is missing something very important and essential -- perhaps not so essential for the Web, but definitly essential for the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> Regards,  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> What is the merit of this over the 'data:' scheme?  </s>
<s> It's actually interesting (IMO) to note that a 'data:' URI is in fact a URV (and hence URP) as it is never dereferenced, but provides a complete, self-contained representation of a resource.  </s>
<s> It is a WYSIWIG URI.  </s>
<s> Thus the URV classification of 'data:' is far more accurate regarding its semantics and application than the current URL classification.  </s>
<s> Cheers,  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> ... The thing that has become clear is that a given URI's characteristics have more to do with how it is used than what its scheme says.  </s>
<s> I hardly consider that something that is "clear" or true.  </s>
<s> Take the simple example of the identity of a thing versus the identity of the representation of a thing, where that thing itself is not a digital resource, e.g. a car.  </s>
<s> The "use 'http:' URLs for everything' approach suggests that a given URL can be used both to denote the thing  </s>
<s> (the car) as well as be dereferenced to retrieve a representation of that thing (e.g. a photo, or technical specs, etc.)  </s>
<s> Yet, a SW application which is trying to "understand" a given statement such as cannot tell whether Fred is the creator of the car itself or of the digital resource retrievable from the URL.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if the URL is intended only to be a URT -- i.e. to be a non-dereferencible identifier of a non-digital resource (just the car), an application has no way of  </s>
<s> knowing if a 404 error is a true error (i.e. it *should* resolve to "something") or just a side effect of the use of a URL as a URT.  </s>
<s> This degree of chaos in the interpretation of URIs is IMO completely unacceptable and will greatly hinder the advancement and deployment of useful SW applications.  </s>
<s> Far better would be and an application knows, based on the defined semantics of 'http:' URLs that it should get "something" when it dereferences the URL and knows, based on the defined semantics of 'voc:' URTs that it should not dereference one but use it simply as a global identifier.  </s>
<s> Cheers,  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Patrick,  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> That's not true.  </s>
<s> We've had this discussion before, and I've pointed out that your assertion above is about the *resource*, i.e. the car.  </s>
<s> If a particular representation of the car was created by somebody else,  </s>
<s> then that should be reflected in a different URI, and the relationship  </s>
<s> between http://foo.com/freds_car/ and this other URI should be authoritatively established with HTTP's Content-Location header.  </s>
<s> e.g.  </s>
<s> GET http://foo.com/freds_car/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: foo.com Accept: image/gif response headers; HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: image/jpg Content-Location: http://foo.com/freds_car/image?format=jpg Then you could make assertions about that particular representation;  </s>

<s> I think you've done a great service to the SW in defining these new URI schema.  </s>
<s> They clearly define our names such that finally our RDF applications will know of what we speak:)  </s>
<s> Do you know of any nasty side effects of starting to use them immediately - i.e. will they break any known RDF parsers ?  </s>
<s> Seth Russell language: Semenglish URI seeAlso "http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00.html" , "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2002Jan/0127.html" .  </s>
<s> Blush... ;-)  </s>
<s> I don't know of any URI schemes that will break any RDF parser, since URIs are expected to be fully opaque in the RDF graph.  </s>
<s> As to RDF applications that attempt to grok URIs for various purposes, I can't say.  </s>
<s> If they are "stupid" and presume that every URI is an 'http:' URI and barf when they fail to resolve, then of course, any of the URP schemes will choke such apps.  </s>
<s> But I think folks should be able to start using them immediately with few, if any, concerns of that sort.  </s>
<s> We are... ;-) Cheers,  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> I agree that if separate URIs are used to denote the non-digital resource and digital representations/expressions of that resource that what you say is true (though the argument that I was contesting about "multipurposed" URIs seems to be a common one).  </s>
<s> However, using a URL to denote a non-digital resource is IMO just  </s>
<s> plain bad practice.  </s>
<s> The point of the 'http:' URI scheme (and forgive me for telling all you other folks what that is, even those of  </s>
<s> you involved in writing the RFCs ;-) is to provide a URI that is meaningful to HTTP resolution, and HTTP resolution is intended to provide access to digital resources.  </s>
<s> The problem is that folks needing to talk about non-digital resources have been so 'http:' URL saturated that they started using them out of habit, or (fairly enough) not having much else to use, and then IMO folks started trying to re-define what URLs are for in order to justify this (mis)use.  </s>
<s> The distinction between URIs denoting accessible digital resources and URIs denoting either abstract concepts or non-digital resources is IMO crucial for the future of the SW. Again, it may not be crucial for the Web, but it is for the SW.  </s>
<s> A content header is not a digital-resource, it is part of the interchange protocol which describes to the recieving application what the content is -- how can you describe empty content?  </s>
<s> And this approach presumes that all that can be known about such a resource can be expressed in the content header.  </s>
<s> And it requires the explicit definition of "non-dereferencable" status for *every* such URI rather than globally for all instances of  </s>
<s> a particular URI scheme, or ideally for a URI class such as URP.  </s>
<s> Far better to be able to know that one has a URP and thereby know that the URI is non-dereferencable than have to define for *every* URP in existence an explicit header response.  </s>
<s> Yikes!  </s>
<s> What a massive overhead!  </s>
<s> This content header approach feels to me like a hack.  </s>
<s> Sorry.  </s>

<s> down your argument.  </s>
<s> 8-)  </s>
<s> It's an assertion, like any other on the Semantic Web, except in RFC 822 format rather than RDF.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, my general attitude towards your drafts are that it's a good idea to be able to know things about resources and the relationships between them.  </s>
<s> You appear to want to put at least some of this  </s>
<s> information into the URI scheme (e.g. HRNs, where the existence of one  </s>
<s> resource implies the existence of other resources), whereas I would prefer that *all* of these relationships were made explicit with the mechanisms provided by the Semantic Web, and that the identifiers themselves remain entirely opaque.  </s>
<s> MB Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.  </s>
<s> mbaker@planetfred.com  </s>
<s> Well, we could do that by simply using only UUIDs.  </s>
<s> But as I pointed out, having to define all of the common, shared semantics explicitly for every single identifier is IMO the way of madness.  </s>
<s> The whole point IMO of URI schemes is to be able to capture the common semantics and intended application of sets of  </s>
<s> identifiers in a consistent and efficient manner.  </s>
<s> Capturing common semantics in a formal taxonomy of URI schemes  </s>
<s> allows for all SW applications/layers to benefit, not just HTTP or applications built on HTTP protocols, but any SW application, standard, or methodology that is URI aware.  </s>
<s> HTTP is not the foundation/heart/soul of the SW. URIs are.  </s>
<s> The maximal point of intersection between SW applications  </s>
<s> should be URIs and the common semantics defined for URI  </s>
<s> schemes and the URI classes to which those schemes belong, and the taxonomy of schemes and classes should, IMO, be formal -- i.e. the classical view.  </s>
<s> Regards, Patrick  </s>
<s> That's true, but it doesn't mean that the only way to communicate that  </s>
<s> sort of information is with a new URI scheme.  </s>
<s> The most general model would be to assume an opaque URI scheme, and then build up from there,  </s>
<s> no?  </s>
<s> What should one do when they need to make these same kinds of assertions  </s>
<s> about an existing URI scheme that doesn't already support them (perhaps  </s>
<s> because it's opaque)?  </s>
<s> For example, what if the owner of example.org  </s>

<s> implies the existence of  </s>
<s> MB Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.  </s>
<s> mbaker@planetfred.com  </s>
<s> But it does.  </s>
<s> Although it is rather implicit IMO in the definition of hierarchical URIs, the individual path components are distinct and hence can be referenced individually.  </s>
<s> Note that that does *not* mean that subpaths correlate to URIs, and this is the case also with 'hrn:' and 'voc:', only that one can deduce that such subpaths might be valid URIs and in the case of 'hrn:' and 'voc:' *if* they correlate to resources, there is a defined superordinate/subordinate relation.  </s>
<s> Obviously, though, it is difficult to rebake a cake, and if you put the wrong ingredients into it... cest la vie... ;-)  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> They can be referenced, but so can any local path.  </s>
<s> That's not the same as asserting that they actually identify a resource.  </s>
<s> Hierarchical naming does not in general imply the existence of resources elsewhere in that same hierarchy.  </s>
<s> If you think you've found some text to the contrary, I'd appreciate a pointer though, as I've been looking into the opacity qualities of RFC 2396 recently.  </s>
<s> The point here being that this assertion should be able to be made about any URI, not just ones using a particular URI scheme.  </s>
<s> So the most  </s>
<s> general model for this would be entirely opaque URIs, and explicit assertions made about them.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't follow.  </s>
<s> That sounds like it would be funny, if I understood the context.  </s>
<s> 8-)  </s>
<s> MB Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.  </s>
<s> mbaker@planetfred.com  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> And never stated that such was the case.  </s>
<s> Meaning exactly your argument above, that just because a hierarchical URI can be parsed into discrete subpaths doesn't mean that any of the subpaths denote a resource -- but if they do, there is additional semantics that can be inferred for an 'hrn:' and 'voc:' subpath that cannot be inferred for an 'http:' subpath (or any other hierarchical  </s>
<s> scheme I am aware of).  </s>
<s> Thus, there is functionality defined for 'hrn:'s and 'voc:'s that is not present in 'http:'s, all else being equal (which it isn't ;-)  </s>
<s> Meaning that if needed semantics are not defined for a given URI scheme from the get go, you can't (at least not easily) go back and add it.  </s>
<s> That's why alot of thought went into the  </s>
<s> recipes for 'hrn:' and 'voc:' ;-) (though they may still end up tasting bad to some folks ;-) Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> I believe that this is one of the things that the Semantic Web should be used for.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, where do you draw the line about which  </s>
<s> semantics go where (the URI scheme, or the SW)?  </s>
<s> MB  </s>
<s> Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.  </s>
<s> mbaker@planetfred.com  </s>
<s> I agree that the SW and RDF will play a major role in describing URI schemes and specific URI-denoted resources, but that is neither here nor there, IMO, with regards to what semantics are defined  </s>
<s> for all instances (URIs) of a given URI scheme, or for all instances  </s>
<s> (URI Schemes) of a given URI Class versus the semantics or other knowledge defined for a specific URI -- or rather the resource denoted by that URI.  </s>
<s> It's an issue of scalability.  </s>
<s> To say that URI Schemes are to be as semantically anemic as possible and just make statements about the particular URIs is going to introduce an untenable and unnecessary overhead on the SW.  </s>

<s> Those who feel that 'http:' URIs are URLs and should be expected to resolve to "something" and not be used to denote abstract or non-digital resources seem to have no problem whatsoever with the distinction between URL, URN, etc.  </s>
<s> Finally, it may be that all this has been hashed out in considerable detail in the past (perhaps there are some position summaries in the W3C or IETF archives?) but the fact that class identifiers such as URL, URN, etc. "won't die" suggests that the contemporary view does not reflect the needs of the web community at large.  </s>
<s> The thought has frequently crossed my mind that, while the Web may get along with the contemporary view, the  </s>
<s> Semantic Web will not (or not as well).  </s>
<s> Ultimately, the needs of applications will decide the classicial vs. contemporary issue (and I don't consider it closed) and there are now emerging applications that will benefit from a formal, explicit classification of URI schemes.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> But not all URNs are 'urn:'s.  </s>
<s> 'hrn:'s are also URNs.  </s>
<s> We tried that route and after almost 10 years never got any agreement on it.  </s>
<s> Both sides had perfectly valid points so we wasted _years_ of time on arguments that in the end wouldn't have changed much anyway...  </s>
<s> But your trying to assert the opposite.  </s>
<s> That there is no such thing as a URN other than a 'urn:'.  </s>
<s> The characteristics of a URN scheme are clear enough.  </s>
<s> If a URI scheme has those characteristics then it is fair to call it a URN.  </s>
<s> Honestly, I find the contemporary view very "backwards" in terms of "contemporary" object oriented engineering which attempts to capture and reuse generalities wherever possible.  </s>
<s> Having no formal taxonomy of URI schemes imposes extra burden on applications which must interpret URIs.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> A "clarification" from the W3C does not constitute the dissolution of the relevant RFC's IMO, and unless you can justify that the use of a formal taxonomy has a negative impact to *applications* I see no valid reason for precluding its use.  </s>
<s> Well, I don't intend to win my point by argument (alone).  </s>
<s> My present work in the are of metadata driven systems and semantic web applications (which make use of URPs, URTs, URVs, and of course, URNs and URLs) should sufficiently demonstrate the need and validity of a formal URI class taxonomy.  </s>
<s> All in good time...  </s>
<s> ... If you created a URL object using "hrn:"  </s>
<s> And I disagree.  </s>
<s> A 'URN' is just one URI scheme and trying to get everyone to agree that there's more to it than that just wont' fly.  </s>
<s> I tried arguing that for a long time and in the end I realized it just wasn't worth the effort.  </s>
<s> Sorry, but I don't get that from *any* of the official publications of either the W3C or IETF (and I've been reading carefully).  </s>
<s> Perhaps you or a group of folks in some discussion list say so, but from what I can tell, URN and 'urn:' are not considered the same thing.  </s>
<s> It is true that the recent W3C clarification appears to assert that there is one and only one URN scheme, 'urn:', and from that, one may consider the two synonymous -- but only if one agrees with such an assertion (I certainly don't, and it appears that alot of other folks also don't).  </s>
<s> I'm not using any new terms.  </s>
<s> I'm using the terms as they have been defined.  </s>
<s> I *am* of course, using them as defined by the classical view, and even to a certain extent compatable with my understanding of the contemporary view.  </s>
<s> It seems that there is a third view -- the "absolutist view" ;-) which does not recognize the terms URN or URL at all.  </s>
<s> It may need to try harder ;-)  </s>
<s> IMO, and with all due respect to all of the participants of those long and painful debates that I seem to have missed, the contemporary view has emerged simply because (a) even though URNs were defined, there was no standard resolution solution and those that needed them were a very small minority of web users and (b) 'http:' URLs were highly visible and taken by the majority of web users to be synonymous with URIs and when folks needed URIs for non-digital or abstract resources, they used 'http:' URIs and the (bad) practice became so prolific, that folks threw up their hands and said "since 'http:' URIs are no longer consistently URLs, let's forget about the distinction -- missing the whole point that (1) the distinction is valuable and valid, and (2) bad practice, however prolific, should not be a basis for architectural design.  </s>
<s> Yes, I admit, "them's fightin words" and apologies in advance for all  </s>
<s> insult and injury that may result from them, but I think there is much more than a grain of truth there... and there's more...  </s>
<s> When XML Namespaces came along, folks understandably but inadvisably began using 'http:' URIs for namespaces -- with the interpretation and expectation (not specified in the XML NS spec) that the namespace URI resolve to "something" giving us hacks like RDDL which (albeit a useful solution for general cataloging of model related information) misses the whole point that a namespace does not equate to either a vocabulary or a single schema but is nothing but punctuation; and further served to encourage the mis-interpretation of namespace URIs.  </s>
<s> Had there been valid URT schemes in place when XML NS came, and had they been used in the XML NS examples, we would have avoided *alot* of confusion and the differences between namespace, vocabulary, content model, and schema would be clearer and more widely understood.  </s>
<s> Now, all of that mess was still something the Web could live with, but...  </s>
<s> The SW, however, changes things quite a bit.  </s>
<s> Now there is a significant need for globally unique identifiers denoting abstract concepts and the difference between a 'thing' and some representation of that 'thing' that is web accessible becomes acute.  </s>
<s> And of course, we've needed URT schemes all along for our DTDs, XML Schemas, RDF Schemas, etc.  </s>
<s> And applications neeed to know if an identifier denotes a web resource or some other, non-accessible (non-digital or abstract) resource, and that requires knowledge about the URI schemes.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, online publishing and media distribution is beginning to come of age, and the need for URNs is growing with it.  </s>
<s> Surely folks at the IETF have noted a increase in the demand for registered 'urn:' namespaces?  </s>
<s> Hence the recent streamlining?  </s>
<s> Thus there is growing need for applications to be able to organize and interpret URIs according to scheme specific semantics, and there are numerous schemes with major, functional intersections of semantics which would beg for a taxonomy of schemes, thus the classical view is becoming a necessity.  </s>
<s> (and just so folks know where I'm coming from, in addition to being active in the RDF and SW communities, and a member of the W3C RDF Core WG, I am also a member of both the Metadata and Identifiers working groups of the Open eBook Forum, the leading standard for ePublications, and also am the chief architect of Nokia's documentation and digital resource management solutions, managing several million pages of complex technical, procedural, and user documentation, so my views are based on long, hard experience, and are not just so much arm waving and armchair philosophising) All in all, I think that the contemporary view does not serve the needs of the emerging semantic web and that if 'http:' (mis)use is set aside, out of the picture, it becomes very hard to justify the disposal of the URL, URN, etc. distinctions, and the extended classes URP, URT, and URV reflect distinctions needed by the SW and KM communities for some time.  </s>
<s> Oh, and by the way... ;-) ;-) ;-)  </s>
<s> And where precisely is "here"?  </s>
<s> Planet Earth?  </s>
<s> IETF?  </s>
<s> W3C?  </s>
<s> The URN list?  </s>
<s> The URI list?  </s>
<s> What's interesting is that, while I've always understood the W3C clarification as being a clarification of the *views* -- a tour of the classical and contemporary views and what each one asserts or presumes -- the folks who were involved in writing it seem to think that it rather is a mandate for adoption of the contemporary view.  </s>
<s> I.e. that the interpretation and understanding of the document requires alot of reading between the lines or familiarity with the discussions of the past.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, I consider the choice of terms "contemporary" and "classical" as politically biased, such that if one does not subscribe to the "contemporary" view, one is behind the times and not "with it".  </s>
<s> It says nothing specific to application designers about what the two views mean -- apart from a single mention of the word "formal", which implies that per the contemporary view, URI classes have no formal definition that an application could make use of.  </s>
<s> If not for implementors, then who is the document intended for?  </s>
<s> And, contrary to what you assert above, it does not IMO say that it is either unproductive nor unadvisable or incorrect to speak in terms of URI classes or to assign classifications to URI schems.  </s>
<s> As far as "clarifications" go, it's not very clear.  </s>
<s> The best thing you can and will get is to simply say that there are URIs and that each scheme has its own semantics and anything beyond that is application specific.  </s>
<s> IMNSHO, I think you'll have a better chance putting these semantics into RDF than you ever will getting them as standard parts of the URI definitions....  </s>
<s> And why the heck not?  </s>
<s> If ever there was something in need of standardized definition, it is URI classification.  </s>
<s> As I've said before, URIs are the heart and soul of both the Web and the Semantic Web, so while it is clearly a challenge, we do need to agree about them.  </s>
<s> And my extended taxonomy is based on foundational RFCs which, as far as I am aware, are still valid and authoritative (to the extent that any RFC is authoritative).  </s>
<s> Again, if the IETF or W3C wishes to "kill" URI classes once and for all, then rewrite the RFCs or publish new ones that supercede and deprecate the current ones.  </s>
<s> "Clarifications" that have multiple interpretations just won't do.  </s>
<s> As for me, whether or not it remains a standard, I will continue to hold the classicial view and utilize formal definitions of URI classes, and avoid misusing 'http:' URLs as URNs or URTs.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, there seems to be an awful lot of that sort of thing going on throughout the Internet, as hordes of ignorant newbies flood onto it, commercial interests feel they can make more profit pandering to them than educating them, and the great demand for professional developers and hence the flood of people into that field who weren't necessarily in the traditional "computer geek" mindset ensures that even the "pros" in the Internet community are, on the average, less technically knowledgeable than they were a few years ago.  </s>
<s> The inevitable result is a huge and continuing pressure to dumb everything down to a level the current-day users, developers, bosses, and marketing types can understand, and their eyes tend to glaze over when presented with the sorts of elaborate logical structures that we "techno-geeks" love so much.  </s>
<s> It's happened with domain names: the public gained an oversimplified "understanding" that they all end in .com,  </s>
<s> so even noncommercial and governmental sites often feel compelled to use that ending, and everybody seems to think that separate domain names are needed for every silly marketing gimmick because the masses are presumably too dumb to remember anything with hierarchical subdomain levels in it.  </s>
<s> It's happened with HTML: the web designer community never seemed to be able to understand the concept of a logically structured markup language, when what they wanted was a desktop publishing language to create documents that were as static as if they were on paper, hence the "tag soup" in most Web pages.  </s>
<s> If they observe that UL makes the browser indent, and LI plunks down a bullet, well, then, that's what those tags mean, and who cares whether you actually nest them correctly if the browser "works" with them even if you do it wrong?  </s>
<s> My co-workers still tend to look at me like I'm from Mars whenever I try to explain any of this stuff; they regard it as kind of a personal idiosyncracy that I use CITE elements for citing book and magazine titles on Web pages instead of I (which "means the same thing", because it looks the same in popular browsers; so why learn some other geeky tag?), or because I have retrograde notions not shared by the marketing department to the effect that they maybe should consider using logical subdomains for sites that are logically subordinate to others instead of registering yet another silly- marketing-gimmick domain name.  </s>
<s> My personal websites are full of rants on this sort of thing.  </s>
<s> I guess new URI schemes are yet another battleground for this sort of fight...  </s>
<s> I wonder if "our side" can finally manage to win one?  </s>
<s> I guess it depends on whether the developers of the next generation of software decide to make some use of this stuff, versus sticking to the simpleminded concept that URIs begin with "http://", while patting themselves on the back about how sophisticated they are because they know that "URI" is the current correct name for them instead of "URL" and that "www.somesillyname.com" is not a complete, correct URI without the "http://" part.  </s>
