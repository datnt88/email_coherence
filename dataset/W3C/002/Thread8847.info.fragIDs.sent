Hi all, I have a question regarding the Type attribute in the dsig:Reference element: If this attribute is used, does it relate to (a) the result of resolving the URI given in the Reference's URI attribute 
(b) the result of processing all the Reference's transforms, i. e. the input for digest calculation? 
The only hint I can find in the spec is the following sentence from 
the last but one paragraph of section 4.3.3.1: 
"The optional Type attribute contains information about the type of object being signed." 
The phrase "type of object being signed" seems to indicate that (b) 
is the right interpretation (which is also my personal favorite ;-) 
A similar clarification could make sense for section 4.4.3 (RetrievalMethod). 
What do you think? 
In any case, I suggest a clarification in the errata document. 
Regards, Gregor 
I agree. 
If others find this confusing I could add the following erratum: E05 2002-05-08 (Clarification) The Type attribute described within 4.3.3.1 
The URI Attribute and 4.4.3 
The RetrievalMethod Element "contains information about the type of object being signed." 
The data object is that resulting from the Referencing Processing Model including any specified transforms. 
Using the Type to describe the object that is identified via the ferenceReference URI prior to its input to transforms is incorrect. 
*Note: I will be attending the W3C AC and WWW2002 meetings from May 5-10, and taking holiday from 13-16. 
I will not be as responsive during the former period, and off-line during the latter. 
I will fully respond to any email as soon as possible after my return. 
Joseph, 
Yes, I would appreciate adding the erratum. 
Thanks, Gregor

Yes, it's probably worth including the erratum.

Ok, now present with some tweaks:
