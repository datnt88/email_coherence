<s> Hi all, I have a question regarding the Type attribute in the dsig:Reference element: If this attribute is used, does it relate to (a) the result of resolving the URI given in the Reference's URI attribute  </s>
<s> (b) the result of processing all the Reference's transforms, i. e. the input for digest calculation?  </s>
<s> The only hint I can find in the spec is the following sentence from  </s>
<s> the last but one paragraph of section 4.3.3.1:  </s>
<s> "The optional Type attribute contains information about the type of object being signed."  </s>
<s> The phrase "type of object being signed" seems to indicate that (b)  </s>
<s> is the right interpretation (which is also my personal favorite ;-)  </s>
<s> A similar clarification could make sense for section 4.4.3 (RetrievalMethod).  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> In any case, I suggest a clarification in the errata document.  </s>
<s> Regards, Gregor  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> If others find this confusing I could add the following erratum: E05 2002-05-08 (Clarification) The Type attribute described within 4.3.3.1  </s>
<s> The URI Attribute and 4.4.3  </s>
<s> The RetrievalMethod Element "contains information about the type of object being signed."  </s>
<s> The data object is that resulting from the Referencing Processing Model including any specified transforms.  </s>
<s> Using the Type to describe the object that is identified via the ferenceReference URI prior to its input to transforms is incorrect.  </s>
<s> *Note: I will be attending the W3C AC and WWW2002 meetings from May 5-10, and taking holiday from 13-16.  </s>
<s> I will not be as responsive during the former period, and off-line during the latter.  </s>
<s> I will fully respond to any email as soon as possible after my return.  </s>

<s> Yes, I would appreciate adding the erratum.  </s>
