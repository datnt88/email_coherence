<s> Guys, sorry Im only now getting up to speed on this stuff, and if any of these questions/issues have been already covered in the email record then just say so and I'll get to them eventually.  </s>
<s> Q=question C=comment  </s>
<s> Q1. Definition of TDL refers to a 'pairing'.  </s>
<s> Does that mean some kind of syntactic combination operation, or is this just a mathematical definition of some abstract entity?  </s>
<s> And what exactly is a 'datatype identity'?  </s>
<s> Q2. In the figure immediately below, what is meant by 'internal value' and 'application value space'?  </s>
<s> C[3. Style comment.  </s>
<s> I suggest it would be better to not modify the definition of RDF interpretation, but to introduce a new notion of 'datatyped interpretation' or whatever.  </s>
<s> That would enable us to keep all the different notions of entailment straight.  </s>
<s> ]  </s>
<s> Q4. Terminology section refers to 'before' and 'after' datatyping.  </s>
<s> I have trouble understanding what this means.  </s>
<s> Do you have in mind that there is some kind of process which 'datatypes' an RDF graph?  </s>
<s> If so, what is the difference between the graph before and the graph after that operation?  </s>
<s> Or does this mean something else altogether?  </s>
<s> C5. The literal-value pairs are welldefined but seem odd, since they pair a unicode string with a semantic value, ie a denotation.  </s>
<s> Is that really what you mean?  </s>
<s> If so, then a set of these things would be a  </s>
<s> datatype mapping, right?  </s>
<s> C6. "....A datatype class corresponds to its map, ie a set of pairs..." Well, OK, but this seems a very odd decision.  </s>
<s> First, the natural RDF object corresponding to a set of pairs is a property (extension), not a class.  </s>
<s> Second, while a property can of course have a class extension as well as its property extension, there isnt any implied connection between them in RDF, so if you treat a set of pairs as a class then that amounts to saying that the fact that it is a class of *pairs* is irrelevant to its behavior as a class.  </s>
<s> Third, there is in fact no way to specify in RDF that any particular class is a class of pairs; whereas if you had characterized this as a property, then the RDF semantic conditions imply that it has a property extension (if it is ever used in a triple).  </s>
<s> Q/C7. Interpretation.  </s>
<s> "...the type information is checked by requiring this pair to be a member of each class associated with this node.  </s>
<s> " What does 'associated with this node' mean??  </s>
<s> I think what you mean is 'each class which the denotation of the node is required to be a member of', right?  </s>
<s> (That is what a range constrai...sorry, assertion of a triple using rdfs:Range, would imply, for example.)  </s>
<s> If so, that is what the RDF MT says already.  </s>
<s> But notice that according to your convention about datatype classes, that says that the node labelled with the unicode string denotes a pair, not the value inside the pair.  </s>
<s> Is that really what you want it to say?  </s>
<s> That would mean that the for example the 'same' date written using different date formats are different dates, and so on.  </s>
<s> In fact, as far as identity is concerned, it means that any two values from any two distinct datatyping schemes are never the same value.  </s>
<s> Q8. That same paragraph refers to 'untyped Unicode nodes'.  </s>
<s> Does that imply that there are two kinds of Unicode node?  </s>
<s> If so, how are they distinguished in the syntax?  </s>
<s> Q9. In section 3.1 example 1, the figure has this new kind of (green hexagonal) node in it.  </s>
<s> What is this thing, exactly?  </s>
<s> (Is it an  </s>
<s> extension to the RDF graph syntax?  </s>
<s> Or some kind of external addition to the graph??  </s>
<s> Or what?  </s>
<s> If it is just an annotation, then this is one of the old proposals (called DC in but it reinterprets the xsd: classes in an odd way that makes the assertions wrong, for some reason best known to you guys :-)  </s>
<s> Q/C10. Model Theoretic Interpretation of local idiom.  </s>
<s> "...Hence x is the integer 30." OK, but what this graph asserts is that the age of Bob is the pair "30",30 , right?  </s>
<s> Not that the age of Bob is 30.  </s>
<s> (If that is wrong, how do the interpretation rules for the Bob ex:age ... triple manage to extract the second item in the denoted pair?)  </s>
<s> Also, if what you say about rdf:value is correct, then since the unicode node has to have the same denotation as the blank node, and since that denotation has to be in the class xsd:integer, it has to be a pair; so the unicode node itself has to denote a pair.  </s>
<s> And the first item of that pair is the unicode string itself, right?  </s>
<s> C.11 Relevant to the above: look, you don't need to have *pairs* in the class.  </s>
<s> They are just getting in the way.  </s>
<s> If the xsd:integer class were the value space of the datatype (and if rdf:value were identity) then this idiom would work just fine, and Bob's age would be 30.  </s>
<s> You do need some semantic constraint to interpret the unicode strings properly, but then you need that anyway.  </s>
<s> The pairs don't seem to help any.  </s>
<s> Q12. In section 3.2, global idiom: "Per the following, the lexical form "30" is required to be a member of the lexical space of the datatype xsd:integer".  </s>
<s> HOW?  </s>
<s> I really don't see how this works.  </s>
<s> Since xsd:integer denotes a set of pairs, the range of ex:age must be a set of pairs, so whatever the unicode node denotes must be a pair.  </s>
<s> But you have it marked as 'representing a value'; and you also say that the lexical form is thereby required to be a member of a lexical space.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, this is saying the following.  </s>
<s> The unicode string denotes a pair a,x consisting of a unicode string and a datatype value (eg "13", 13 , which is a member of the extension of the xsd:integer datatype mapping), and it thereby 'represents' a value, and also simultaneously is 'required' to be a member of a lexical space.  </s>
<s> BUt it can't be all three of "13", 13 and "13",13 at the same time, right?  </s>
<s> (Also, re. 'required': what if the unicode string is NOT a member of the lexical space of the asserted datatype?  </s>
<s> Is that just an inconsistency?)  </s>
<s> C13. (Following on from C11).  </s>
<s> It seems clear from the diagram that what this RDF is supposed to mean is that the range of ex:age is integers (according to xsd:integer, ie the value space), and that the age of Bob is 30.  </s>
<s> What's wrong with just declaring that that is indeed what it does mean?  </s>
<s> See The problem with the old P(++) proposals was the nasty flaw detected by Patrick , which is that a super-datatype-class of a datatype class might have a different lexical-to-value mapping.  </s>
<s> But your 'pairs' proposal has exactly the same problem.  </s>
<s> In fact it is worse, since if the lexical-to-value mapping is different, then the datatypes are not even subclasses of one another, with your convention; so there isn't even any way to *say* that one datatype is 'sub' another.  </s>
<s> (Of course, just refusing to say that, say, xxsd:octal is a subclass of xxsd:number, or whatever the example is that screws up datatype inheritance, was always an option in the old P(++)-style proposal as well.  </s>
<s> )  </s>
<s> C14. The paragraph "Whether the rdfs:range statement....property in question."  </s>
<s> isn't going to work in ANY model theory, unless we effectively redefine RDF syntax to provide some way to distinguish local from global.  </s>
<s> The MT has to be defined on triples, not on triples in some kind of undefined 'context'.  </s>
<s> (How far out do we have to look in the graph, or on the web, to see if there is a 'more local' assertion?)  </s>
<s> C15. The list of Satisfactions looks good, but omits the one rather central one which I guess people didnt think to write out explicitly: that the idiom used actually means what it ought to mean.  </s>
<s> C16. Neat hack for almost handling union datatypes, ie ignore the part that gives all the trouble.  </s>
<s> If I can use that same hack, I can do them too :-)  </s>

<s> Thanks Pat for the detailed analysis.  </s>
<s> This message expands significantly on what in the TDL document I glossed over as "technical reasons".  </s>
<s> Short version: I am not surprised that you were not happy with the TDL model theory.  </s>
<s> The basic choice to use pairs rather than just (typed) values in the model theory was due to limits of my technical competence.  </s>
<s> I tried and failed to come up with an account that uses values.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, no one actually advocates using pairs.  </s>
<s> If you can come up with an account that addresses your Q/Cs about pairs, using my hack (C16) for union datatypes, and otherwise resurrect the P++ model theory (I think), then please do.  </s>
<s> I will be relieved.  </s>
<s> I provide some motivation for literal-value pairs in my response to your Q8 &amp; Q9 below.  </s>
<s> This is of the sort "I didn't want to use pairs, but I had to in order to My response to C15, in a separate e-mail, gives some idea of why I don't see the use of literal-value pairs as disastrous, but merely an inconvenient technicality.  </s>
<s> Aside: If I have understood your comments correctly you have not identified any new fundamental mistakes with my MT (like the self-entailment bug).  </s>
<s> As such I achieved my objective: giving an existence proof for there being at least one formal framework for Patrick's pairing, PD framework.  </s>
<s> I see your comments as listing other desirable characteristics that I failed to achieve.  </s>
<s> Detailed response:  </s>
<s> For Patrick, as I understand it, the key idea is that datatyping is about pairs.  </s>
<s> Each pair being a string from the input document and the type with which to interpret the string.  </s>
<s> I find this pairing a little simplistic, in that in the syntactic idiom of range constraints for example, many types can be applied.  </s>
<s> Thus if we wanted  </s>
<s> to treat the pairing of a string and its type formally, we would have to introduce a new anonymous type being the intersection of all the given types.  </s>
<s> I considered this and rejected it.  </s>
<s> I also considered and rejected suggesting to Patrick that the emphasis on string-type pairs should be dropped.  </s>
<s> As a first approximation to what is  </s>
<s> going on, I believe the string-type pairing idea helpful, particularly to the reader who does not wish to understand all the details.  </s>
<s> I also believe that the string-type pair is a very plausible implementation technique.  </s>
<s> I think the document suffers stylistically because my key input was also a pairing, but a different one!  </s>
<s> (The literal-value pair).  </s>
<s> I will leave this one to Patrick.  </s>
<s> Although see my (separately posted) response to C15, which I think touches on similar issues.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> If we conclude that the doc is worth a major revision I will put this on the to-do list.  </s>
<s> Yes the terminology is poor.  </s>
<s> Try: For clarity, we use disjoint terminology for literals in the graph syntax, and their interpretations and meanings both in the model theory's universe.  </s>
<s> [ bullet pointed defns] The literal-value pairs occur in the model theory's universe.  </s>
<s> The intent is that RDF applications may manipulate either or both of the Unicode string or the typed value.  </s>
<s> This is all true.  </s>
<s> At no point does TDL use a datatype as a property as in S-A.  </s>
<s> Therefore it would be odd to include such properties in the model.  </s>
<s> I am wondering if you wrote your comments as you were going through or on a second reading.  </s>
<s> It feels to me as if in this para above you haven't really appreciated how I am trying to consistently follow what I agree was an odd decision (C5).  </s>
<s> Your later comments seem to have accepted this more.  </s>
<s> Yes, yes, yes.  </s>
<s> This was intended to be consistent with your MT document in its usage of rdfs:Range.  </s>
<s> And yes, your date example illustrates a limitation of TDL (not shared by S-A).  </s>
<s> No. There are only the same old (untidy) literals that we have always had.  </s>
<s> The untyped ones are just those that are not subject to any type constraints.  </s>
<s> So a straight triple with no constraints like: _:a foo "fred".  </s>
<s> The "fred" is an "untyped Unicode node" of this paragraph.  </s>
<s> Once we apply an rdfs:range constraint to foo , then "fred" is no longer untyped.  </s>
<s> Similarly the two triples: _:a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> _:b rdf:value "bar" .  </s>
<s> leave "bar" as untyped, but an rdf:type triple on _:b, along with the semantics of rdf:value can apply a type to "bar".  </s>
<s> I think this is an appropriate place to expand on the "technical reasons".  </s>
<s> The TDL MT is intended to systematically follow an open world assumption on both triples and types.  </s>
<s> So when seeing either the single "fred" triple or the two "bar" triple, without any other information, we want to have some set of interpretations.  </s>
<s> When we also have a range constraint available, and we "know" the datatype of the range constraint or we have a triple like _:b rdf:type xsd:string .  </s>
<s> (applying to the "bar" example).  </s>
<s> we wish to have a subset of interpretations.  </s>
<s> Hence, as I saw it, the set of possible typed values corresponding to an 'untyped Unicode node' (e.g. "fred" in the single triple example) is unbounded.  </s>
<s> As intellgible type information is added we monotonically reduce the set of possible typed values.  </s>
<s> The cardinality of the set of possibilities is unbounded in the untyped case and 1 or 0 in the typed case (excepting union datatypes).  </s>
<s> The literal-value pair was motivated partly because I wasn't prepared to stomach a wholly unrestricted interpretation of 'untyped Unicode nodes'.  </s>
<s> Thus the first component is always uniquely resticted and the second component is restricted or not depending on type information.  </s>
<s> It is just an annotation and is not in the syntax.  </s>
<s> This idiom is the DC idiom.  </s>
<s> I understand the "makes the assertions wrong" part of the question as: "But why on earth are you interpreting the bnode as a pair rather than simply the typed value?"  </s>
<s> So answering my (possibly incorrect) rephrasing of your question.  </s>
<s> 1] I wanted a monotonic semantics.  </s>
<s> What does aaa eg:prop _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:value "10" .  </s>
<s> mean without an rdf:type?  </s>
<s> What does it mean with both an eg:decimalInteger and an eg:octalInteger type (assuming we have both available).  </s>
<s> aaa eg:prop _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:value "10" .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:type eg:decimalInteger .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:type eg:octalInteger .  </s>
<s> 2] (variant of [1]) I wouldn't want to rule out multiple types, because sometimes it works.  </s>
<s> 3] Even in the daml idiom aaa eg:prop _:x .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:value "10" .  </s>
<s> _:x rdf:type xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> How are we to know that the rdf:value needs to use the xsd:integer mapping function, and not the eg:octal mapping function.  </s>
<s> Both would associate an integer to _:x, so either would satisfy _:x rdf:type xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> if we understand that as merely operating in the value space.  </s>
<s> 4] Both issues [1], [2], [3] can be replicated for examples based around aaa eg:prop "10" .  </s>
<s> and using range constraints on eg:prop.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important when we consider [2].  </s>
<s> If we have a data document, a schema document, and a second alternative schema document all independently authored, all three documents may be usable together (consistent) despite a lack of direct collaboration.  </s>
<s> The ability to ignore minor unimportant variations in range constraints seems desirable.  </s>
<s> (And the ability to distinguish between important and unimportant variations in range constraints).  </s>
<s> I believe that the model theory I produced is monotonic and does cover the whole range of synatctic possibilities, not just the recommended idiom.  </s>
<s> I have not understood how Peter's work or your (unfinished) P++ work address [1], [2], [3], [4] above.  </s>
<s> Yes,you have understood.  </s>
<s> I always use the literal-value pair, everywhere.  </s>
<s> There are no bare values in the model, there are no bare literals in the model.  </s>
<s> The phrase quoted "Hence ..." was intended less formally, and perhaps better have mentioned something about an RDF application treating x as the value 30.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I agree the pairs are inconvenient.  </s>
<s> In your view, how do we *not* get Bob's age to be 24 with an octal reading of the string "30"?  </s>
<s> On the graph there is the literal label "13".  </s>
<s> In the model theoretic interpretation there is the pair "13",13 .  </s>
<s> The application may well decide to only use the second component (13) of the pair from the model theoretic interpretation.  </s>
<s> In this sense it is all three at the same time.  </s>
<s> Now, I will try an explain HOW the constraint of the string to the lexical space happens.  </s>
<s> This supplements the subsection entitled "Model Theoretic Interpretation of Global Idiom".  </s>
<s> The text '"30" is required to be a member of the lexical space' was informal, intended for RDF/XML document authors.  </s>
<s> Clarifying what the 'requirement' is may be as follows: "When using this idiom you are required to use a string that is in the lexical space of the datatype, [ or else your document will be RDFS inconsistent ]" I take you to be interested in the last bit about RDFS inconsistency.  </s>
<s> I will use an example, in which instead of "30" we will have "foo" as the literal label.  </s>
<s> The interpretation of "foo" is required to be a pair  "foo", x  for some x.  </s>
<s> Using the schema closure rules from RDF model theory we effectively have a triple of the form: "foo" rdf:type xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> (the literal node "foo" is intended as the very same literal node that is the object of the ex:age triple.  </s>
<s> The schema rules as I understand them are all actually constraints concerning IEXT, but I find them much more difficult to state) This datatype class membership, as always in the TDL MT, is understood as being about the pair being in the map.  </s>
<s> There are no pairs  "foo", x  in the map of the datatype xsd:integer, and hence whatever x we choose the interpretation did not statisfy the schema constraints.  </s>
<s> Thus: For RDF (without schema), the two triples are consistent, with interpretations of the "foo" node being  "foo", x  for arbitrary x Whereas for RDFS, the schema processing makes the two triples inconsistent.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the lexical space of xsd:integer is defined as the domain of the map.  </s>
<s> The example above shows, at least when we have RDF schema processing, the two triples are inconsistent unless the label of the literal node is in the domain of the map of the datatype.  </s>
<s> Hence the label is constrained to be in the lexical space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Ummm, no.  </s>
<s> I did look carefully at your referenced message, it's still in my browser cache!  </s>
<s> As indicated under Q9 I saw no way of keeping a model that interprets the strings solely in the value space while addressing the inconsistent lexical= value mappings problem.  </s>
<s> I don't think the inconsistent mappings problem is restricted to subclasses, it occurs whenever two datatypes have overlapping value spaces.  </s>
<s> I believe my solution is consistent with XML Schema Datatypes class hierarchy which I understand as being essentially the subset hierarchy on the mappings.  </s>
<s> i.e. if A is an xsd subtype of B then A.map is subset of B.map If I have misunderstood that aspect of XML Schema Datatypes TDL model theory will at least need a revision.  </s>
<s> This paragraph is again intended for RDF/XML document &amp; RDF schema authors.  </s>
<s> If a schema author uses a range constraint there has been a long standing discussion as to whether this is "a constraint" that documents must satisfy or a means for generating implicit triples.  </s>
<s> Of course, this long standing discussion is groundless.  </s>
<s> However, there is a community that expects clarity on this issue.  </s>
<s> For you, Pat, I will deconstruct the informal text, in model theoretic terms.  </s>
<s> However, I do not think it appropriate that our documents should be targetted at model theoreticians alone.  </s>
<s> The TDL document has clearly identified sections with model theory, the other sections are, and are intended as less formal.  </s>
<s> I have proof-read them to check that there is (IMO) a consistent reading with the model theory.  </s>
<s> "Whether the rdfs:range statement constitutes a constraint on the allowed datatypes depends on whether there exists any local (explicit) type assignment."  </s>
<s> Model theoretically when both global range constraints and local type triples are present in a graph both apply.  </s>
<s> "If there is no local typing for the literal value whatsoever, then rdfs:range can only serve as a global (implicit) type assignment."  </s>
<s> If there is no local typing, only global typing applies, and a contradition based on two types clashing is not possible.  </s>
<s> (This doesn't exclude a contradiction because the unicode string is not in the lexical space of the type).  </s>
<s> "However, if the literal has one or more types defined locally, and any locally specified datatype is not compatible with all datatypes globally implied by rdfs:range for the property, one can treat such a case as a contradition to a constraint on the expected or required datatype(s) for the property in question."  </s>
<s> When both local and global types are given, a possible contradition is that the intersection of the mappings of all applicable types is empty, (or does not include the unicode string in its domain).  </s>
<s> Consider when: - all the triples apart from the local type triple are consistent - all the triples including the local type triple are inconsistent.  </s>
<s> This constrains the local type in the sense that a different choice of local type by the RDF/XML document author would result in a consistent document.  </s>
<s> I understand this being a plea to use values rather than literal-value pairs in the model.  </s>
<s> See separate response.  </s>
<s> Please do.  </s>
<s> Notice this is part of the systematic monotonicity of TDL model theory.  </s>
<s> See ya Jeremy  </s>
<s> I only offer a few comments here that hopefully will be useful.  </s>
<s> If not, ignore them.  </s>
<s> They are simply intended to clarify the intent of the non-MT portions of the TDL proposal, per Pat's questions.  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> If mulitple TDL pairings can be inferred from mutiple range constraints, then you have multiple possible interpretations.  </s>
<s> And if a given literal is a member of multiple TDL pairings, then it is expected that multiple types can be applied to it.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is simple, but I don't think it is simplistic ;-)  </s>
<s> Of course, that would be hard to do, since that *is* the TDL model ;-)  </s>
<s> Any application that wishes to compare two actual values must provide a canonical, internalized representation for them.  </s>
<s> That representation is not necessarily a lexical representation (and for numerical types rarely is).  </s>
<s> Each application needing to compare two values expressed in an RDF graph must execute the mapping from the lexical form in the RDF graph to that internalized value, which is a proxy for the single unique member of the value space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> See the definition in section 2.1 for "typed data literal" (TDL).  </s>
<s> As the label in the hexagon indicates, it shows the TDL pairing of lexical form and datatype identity (literal and URIref).  </s>
<s> It is pointing to the pair of labels, not nodes, which denotes a single value in the value space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> It is this pairing that allows an application to map the lexical form into an internalized representation for the value.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
<s> Pat:  </s>
<s> I understand this as meaning that when people write "10" and say that it is an integer they mean it to be an integer.  </s>
<s> Not a string, not a pair, but an integer.  </s>
<s> A partial response is simply to say well, nobody got there.  </s>
<s> S-A does achieve that in the model theory, but S-B leaves it as a string, S-P and TDL both use a pair.  </s>
<s> If anyone can propose a model theory for either TDL or S that consistently gets us to values that would almost certainly be an excellent proposal.  </s>
<s> I now give a very long digression before responding to the comment.  </s>
<s> Please note: - I am trying very hard to be balanced in this message.  </s>
<s> - I have deleted some "knocking S" copy.  </s>
<s> - I even say "S-A is the best" below.  </s>
<s> DIGRESSION - DATATYPING, THEORY &amp; APPLICATION I'll give a more accurate rendition of my current understanding, which is inspired by both Brian's "the line" and Graham's clarification about the lexical string/value distinction: Jeremy:  </s>
<s> TDL allows clarity about this distinction, and allows query researchers to explore both possibilities.  </s>
<s> Graham: So does S. In the case of S, the method used (value or literal) is explicit in the vocabulary used.  </s>
<s> (For me this is an observation, not a show-stopper either way.) We seem to be doing RDF with model theory and some programming above model theory.  </s>
<s> I will call this enterprise "applied model theory".  </s>
<s> I am assuming that the datatyping discussion is about how RDF/XML document authors and RDF applications communicate and process typed values, and what responsibilities lie where, and how clarity is maintained in such communication and processing.  </s>
<s> In the old M&amp;S, there was only a data model and no model theory in the logic sense, and no datatypes.  </s>
<s> So reasoning about entailment, satisfiability, and typed values etc. and all responsibility for consistency etc. lies in the application code: M&amp;S: |X|Application Code: |9| Consistency, datatyping etc. |8| |7| |6| |5| |4| |3| |2|============================ |1| Theory: Data model Some of the datatyping and consistency may be being done by a generic RDF platform, but that is not part of the standard, and is still conceptually (at least from the standards viewpoint) application code.  </s>
<s> [The numbers down the left of my pictures is just to allow you to print them off and line them up.  </s>

<s> For example unconstrained type conversion may lead to consistency problems as in Issue B8 S-B is the most conservative datatyping idiom, in that the model theory still operates entirely at the lexical representation level.  </s>
<s> Only a very small extra amount of work is done by the lower layer, that of checking that type conversion is possible.  </s>
<s> (But the type conversion is not actually done).  </s>

<s> S-P and TDL are equivalent and in both the lower layer does the conversion but only partially in that it does not take responsibility for when to detach the value from the lexical form.  </s>

<s> S-A: |X|Application Code: |9| |8| ============================ |7| |6| Dropping of lexical string |5| Datatype conversion |4| Entailment |3| Consistency |2| Data Model |1| Theory With this view the choices facing us vis-a-vis datatyping are:  </s>
<s> - choose only S-A and deprecate all other idioms.  </s>
<s> This is the theoretically most appealling route in my view.  </s>
<s> - choose the mixed approach S = S-A + S-B + S-P This allows document authors to choose which set of responsibilites they want to take; and how much support they expect from the model theory.  </s>
<s> Applications either have to restrict themselves to some sub-idiom or be able to cope with the mix.  </s>
<s> - choose one of { nothing, S-P/TDL, S-B } + Doing nothing is known to work - i.e. we know the downsides of not having any datatyping support and it isn't appalling.  </s>
<s> + S-B (only) is a low risk approach to putting a bit of datatyping in.  </s>
<s> + TDL offers more datatyping support than S-B.  </s>
<s> Applications still need to determine whether to look at typed values or the literal strings.  </s>
<s> END DIGRESSION  </s>
<s> So, in TDL and S-P, the model theory ends at a literal-value pair, which isn't 'what it ought to mean'.  </s>
<s> That's not saying that that's where the application ends, thats where the application starts.  </s>
<s> It is an improvement on the current position of the application starting with a string before getting to 'what it ought to mean'.  </s>
<s> It isn't as good as S-A.  </s>
<s> But then S-A, by itself, doesn't meet some of the (non model theoretic) desiderata.  </s>
<s> Jeremy PS: Pat:  </s>
<s> Your questions were refreshingly different from the rather tired discussion that the rest of us have been having.  </s>
<s> Excellent summary, Jeremy.  </s>
<s> Theoretically, perhaps, but not practically.  </s>
<s> This is not acceptable, unfortunately, as that does not provide us with any means for global typing and precludes the use of schema implied typing.  </s>
<s> It also prevents any means of asserting system typing on locally typed knowledge, which needs both local and global types asserted.  </s>
