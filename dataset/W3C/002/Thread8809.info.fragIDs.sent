<s> Dear DDJ Editors, As a co-author of the XML Signature specification, which is currently a W3C proposed recommendation, I was surprised by some of the content of Mr. Davis' article on defective sign and encrypt.  </s>
<s> Overall, I enjoyed the article, and I agree with his premise that care must be taken in the  </s>
<s> sign-and-encrypt scenario to avoid the surreptitious forwarding problem.  </s>
<s> However, I think the article is incorrect in its heavy-handed indictment of the XML Signature specification.  </s>
<s> I found several remarks in the article (e.g. "...they underestimated the subtlety of adding cryptography...") to be representative of a position of condescension that is undefensible, in part due to the contradiction that arises when the article asserts that the problem is not in fact with signatures per se, but rather "it is the presence of the encrypting envelope that" causes the problem (p. 30).  </s>
<s> Moreover, on a technical level, I disagree with Mr. Davis' assertion that it is difficult to codify a standard solution to this problem, and the article would have been improved had he taken more time to consider what can be done with XML Signature.  </s>
<s> To wit, the XML signature namespace includes an Object tag that allows the consumer of XML Signature technology to add whatever additional information is cogent to the context.  </s>
<s> The Object tag is a well-known part of the specification that appears in its earliest examples.  </s>
<s> It is a simple matter to require (or at least recommend) that signatures created in a sign and encrypt scenario be created with an Object element that contains a Recipient element which, in turn, can contain an encoding of the intended recipient's public key certificate (thus taking the solution suggested by Mr. Davis in Example 2a).  </s>
<s> Had Mr. Davis ever raised this issue with the XML Signature working group (which he has not done at the time of this writing), I for one would have provided the simple solution above, and I may have even added it to the Signature Scenarios document (http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/PROP-xmldsig-faq-20000218/Overview.h tml).  </s>
<s> To his credit, I notice that Mr. Davis has raised this issue with the XML encryption group, where the issue properly resides.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I do not agree with the group's current decision not to address Mr. Davis' point, but I am not in the XML encryption working group and am writing mainly to set the record straight about XML Signature.  </s>
<s> The XML Signature specification is a mature work nearing completion and easily capable of providing a solution (given above) for the surreptious forwarding problem discussed in Mr. Davis' article.  </s>

<s> Dear John,  </s>
<s> please note also the effort of ETSI to provide a XML Format for advanced features like time-stamps and certificates.  </s>
<s> This effort want's to provide a XML Format for Electronic Signatures as defined by the EU Signature Directive.  </s>
<s> I have to ask back, where the full Draft is available on the Web...  </s>
<s> But as Gregor Karlinger is one of the co-authors, perhaps he can give us more information.  </s>
