Hi! 
When trying out my DAV server I noticed that Microsofts Web Folders had problems when I sent "HTTP/1.1 200 Ok" as status line in a PROFIND response, e.g. But when I use upper case characters everything works nicely, e.g. Can anyone confirm this? 
This is bad behaviour by Web Folders is it not?

Hi Martin, 
Well, I can't confirm the behavior, but if this is indeed what is going on, then it's non-compliant behavior. 
The status XML element is defined as "status-line", which is defined in HTTP/1.1, and status-line will accept any text except for CR and LF. 
So lower case should have been fine. 
In fact, anything there should have been fine -- the "OK" isn't meaningful to the protocol.

I'm only here for about five more hours before leaving for the weekend (and still getting out from a couple days of email while I was gone :-( ), so I haven't done testing on the above problem. 
But I can echo what Jim says: it shouldn't be looking at that text. 
In fact, mod_dav regularly issues status line like this: (Apache doesn't provide a way to get standard text for error codes) I haven't heard or seen any problem related to this.

Martin is right. 
I tried with "OK" and "Ok" in the propstat status element. 
When the status was then webfolders was 'OK', however, when the status was then webfolders was not 'Ok' (sic), and the results were displayed as nameless icons (in the details view). 
When the first line (of the response) status message is changed, the webfolders continue to work ok.

tim Martin is right. 
I tried with "OK" and "Ok" in the propstat tim status element. 
I believe (but haven't confirmed) this whole "text stuff" problem is fixed if the client is Windows2000. 
Might also be fixed if the client machine runs Office2000 with the ill-fated SR1 installed. 
I don't know if there is (yet) a fix if you aren't in one of those buckets (if, for example, you get your Web Folders by virtue of using a recent MSIE).
