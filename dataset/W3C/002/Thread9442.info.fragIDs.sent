Congratulations for Jema! 
Brian, is there somewhere a Jema web page? 
I've put DanC's rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf testcase at 
and FrankM's rdfs-no-cycles-in-subPropertyOf at I changed some URI's in them and I think they are OK. 
BTW, Brian, a possible agenda point for next meeting is also 
there

Hi Jos, 
Not yet. 
I'm trying to kill to birds with one stone. 
I'm want to get some practical experience of using rdf. 
And I want some tools to help with the more mundane tasks of being chair. 
Writing up is not high on my list. 
Noted. Brian 
Thanks Jos. 
Could I ask you and Art, as you are reviewing the subPropertyOf ones, also to look at the subClassOf ones too so we can formally approve them at tomorrows telecon. 
And of course anyone else who is minded to. 
Brian
