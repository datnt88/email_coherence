<s> As canonicalizing the SignedInfo element or serializing the result of enveloped-siganture transform and URI="#ID", I guess an element is serialized with xml: prefixed attributes in its ancestors because these cases are *subsets* of a document.  </s>
<s> But I don't know whether comment nodes are serialized or not because these subsets are not defined as XPath expressions.  </s>

<s> XPath expression for the enveloped-signature transform is defined in the specificatoin.  </s>

<s> Hi Kent, Both the old enveloped sig transform (had it worked) and the one under the newly proposed transform processing model would have resulted in omitted comments.  </s>
<s> Although the enveloped signature transform does not explicitly exclude the comments, the Reference URI="" under the old system would have canonicalized the current document to form the octet stream input for the enveloped signature.  </s>
<s> C14N omits comments by default.  </s>
<s> Under the new system, it is explicitly stated that URI="" results in a full node-set that omits comments.  </s>
<s> Joseph: This is exactly why the spec needed to be more specific about comments versus no comments.  </s>
<s> One byte of comment where it doesn't belong and BOOM, failed reference validation.  </s>
<s> I would therefore ask you to please be generous in the number of changes I made that you decide to keep and/or not substantially alter.  </s>
