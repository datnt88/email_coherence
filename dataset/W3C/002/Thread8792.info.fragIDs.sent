Hi all, just one idea that I had during having a look at the ETSI documents about 
qualifying signatures[1]. 
Would it make sense to add a critical attribute to the ds:Object that indicates that it includes some properties that have to be understood by the verification application? 
I think about a mechanism 
like the X.509v3 extensions which have a critical flag, which means that _if_ it's set the application must understand the extension... 
In [1], the ETSI defines a way to include additional information about a signature inside it... Regards, Christian PS: This would include a tweak to the signature verification processing model and a schema change. 
The schema change could be easy if we default this to critical='false'. 
But the processing model would have to say something like: "If a ds:Reference references an ds:Object of the signature with critial='true' and the application does not know how to handle the statements inside ds:Object, the verification MUST fail...." [1] Standard ETSI TS 101 203 - XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES) 
No. XML Signature defines what must be understood by XML Signature applications. 
Trust semantics, particularly criticality have been out of scope from the start. 
Hi Joseph, 
OK, makes sense. 
Thanks, Christian
