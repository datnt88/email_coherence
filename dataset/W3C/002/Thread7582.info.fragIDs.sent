<s> A recent proposal is to leave the DELETE method applied to advanced collection members to be as vaguely specified as it currently is in the HTTP-1.1 and WebDAV specs, and to define an UNBIND method for advanced collections with the proposed advanced collection "delete" semantics.  </s>
<s> In last weeks conference call, I agreed to that proposal, but reserved the option to object to it, if I could think of why it made me uncomfortable.  </s>
<s> Well, I'll now exercise that option (:-).  </s>
<s> This proposal has the downside that instead of just issuing a DELETE request, an advanced-collection aware client must first issue an UNBIND request, and if that fails because the resource is not a member of an advanced collection, it then issues a DELETE request.  </s>
<s> But I don't see any upside ... a server that supports advanced collections must support UNBIND semantics, so how does it provide any benefit to say that an UNBIND request MUST have unbind semantics, while a DELETE request MAY have unbind semantics?  </s>
<s> Perhaps I'm just missing what the upside is?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>

<s> Mmm, even with DESTROY, the client can't really be certain what's going to happen in the long term.  </s>
<s> Suppose the server crashes hard and gets restored from last night's backups?  </s>
<s> (OK, so that's an extreme case, but still.) And, as I said before, what if you have interrelated resources, and the only way to DESTROY one is to DESTROY them all?  </s>
<s> The client needs a way to know.  </s>
<s> (One option: DESTROY requires a Targets: header, or perhaps a body, which contains a list of URIs; this list of URIs must be exactly the same set as the URIs which will be DESTROYed; if not, DESTROY will fail and report the correct list.  </s>
<s> Then the client has the chance to check to make sure that the user really does want to DESTROY all of them before resubmitting the request.  </s>
<s> Of course, if the list changes quickly, this will get annoying; but it's safe, anyway.)  </s>
<s> I suspect that we're covering the same ground that HTTP/1.1 did when they not-quite-defined DELETE.  </s>
<s> Larry, are you listening to this thread?  </s>
<s> Can you  </s>

<s> As discussed in the teleconference, the proposal was: UNBIND: MUST remove binding, MUST NOT destroy any state on the server DELETE: MUST remove binding, MAY destroy state on the server DESTROY: MUST remove binding, MUST destroy state Yes, I remember the proposal.  </s>
<s> It was the updside that I couldn't reconstruct.  </s>
<s> So, the upside was that DELETE would "do the right thing" for downlevel HTTP and DAV clients (like Office 2000), That's what I don't get.  </s>
<s> How can "MAY destroy state" be any more desireable for a client (or serve to increase interoperability) than "MUST NOT destroy state".  </s>
<s> Requiring that DELETE on an advanced collection member be UNBIND still gives downlevel HTTP and DAV clients no more or less than they could expect from a conforming server.  </s>
<s> but that clients which understand the advanced collections specification could do more precise operations by selecting either UNBIND or DESTROY, where they'll know exactly what the server will do.  </s>
<s> They can get the same precision with less effort if we define DELETE to be UNBIND.  </s>
<s> I still don't see any benefit to either an up or down level client or server that results from introducing a separate UNBIND operation.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Perhaps, although looking through the HTTP-WG mailing list archives, I couldn't find much in the way of discussion on DELETE.  </s>
<s> There was one discussion on whether it should be in or out of the protocol, but no real discussion on its semantics.  </s>
<s> I'm getting the sense that the semantics of DELETE were never discussed in depth on the HTTP-WG list (which doesn't mean they weren't discussed off-list).  </s>
