<s> I believe not.  </s>
<s> As an example, if versioned resource A has three revisions, each revision has its own unique URL.  </s>
<s> At least one, yes.  </s>

<s> The "MOVE" should fail (otherwise you've rewritten history in some bizarre fashion).  </s>
<s> Note that a "MOVE" of a *reference* to a revision (which is what appears in a "workspace") just moves that reference from one collection to another, and has no effect on the underlying revision or its versioned resource.  </s>
<s> The COPY just acts like a normal COPY of one (non-versioned) resource to another.  </s>
<s> If so, does that create a new versioned resource?  </s>
<s> No. And if the operation was a MOVE, is that revision no longer a revision in the source revision set?  </s>
<s> If we make MOVE fail, we don't have to answer this question.  </s>
<s> Note that a DELETE on a revision is allowed (although the underlying CM engine must be allowed to refuse to carry out the DELETE, if it doesn't believe in changing history).  </s>
<s> Also, my understanding is that each versioned resource will have a unique URL as well as each revision of that versioned resource having its own URL.  </s>
<s> Is that everyone's understanding?  </s>

<s> Addressing this problem is one of the reasons I support Jim's original proposal of a "VPortal" to reference revisions, although I renamed it a "Workspace", and generalized it to handle versioned collections (see my earlier "Versioned Collections" message).  </s>
<s> In particular, in this proposal, a MOVE or COPY applied to the URL of a versioned resource results in a move or copy of the entire versioned resource.  </s>
<s> The underlying CM engine must be allowed to cause a MOVE to fail, if it does not support the movement of versioned resources.  </s>
<s> Similarly, both a COPY and a MOVE of a versioned might fail if the destination "repository" of the method is incompatible with the "source" repository that contains the versioned resource.  </s>

<s> No we haven't specified the exact behavior (but we need to).  </s>
<s> My assumption has always been that a move would fail and a copy would succeed.  </s>
<s> I think you can do this either using the revision-specific URL or by specifying a Revision-Id header.  </s>
<s> I think that in some cases a new versioned resource might be created.  </s>
<s> For example, copying from one workspace configuration to another might create a new versioned resource.  </s>
<s> I think of the workspace configurations as distinct from one another.  </s>
