<s> Hello, I've noticed that the recent C version of tidy (HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 released on 1st January 2003) as well as HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 released on 1st November 2002 produces output quite different from that of HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (release date: 1st October 2002; built on Oct 8 2002, at 23:33:07) when using "-i -wrap 78" options.  </s>
<s> For example, h3 element is now split into three lines, except of been placed on one.  </s>
<s> This is quite troublesome, because I'm using tidy to make sure that changes to html documentation result in minimal textual difference.  </s>
<s> If several persons you different versions of tidy, or tidy behaviour changes, the difference between document version is rather large.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to get older behaviour back with command line switches.  </s>
<s> More general question: is there a place where changes in formatting behaviour are documented, so that I can learn proper combination of switches myself.  </s>
<s> TIA, Volodya  </s>
<s> Hi Vladimir,  </s>
<s> Yes, the behavior of the -i command line option was changed to match its historical behavior, namely --indent yes.  </s>
<s> For details, see http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=2512745.  </s>
<s> To get the prior output, use this: --indent auto See http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#indent  </s>
<s> Note, --indent yes (and, therefore, -i) is deprecated because the liberties it takes with whitespace are known to cause layout problems in browsers.  </s>
<s> hth, Charlie  </s>
<s> Hi Charles,  </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply!  </s>
<s> Yes, this improves things, but not completely fixes them.  </s>
<s> For example, there's no newline after /pre element.  </s>
<s> So the question remains: is it always possible to get behaviour of the previous tidy version by tweaking options and where do I learn what options must be tweaked.  </s>
<s> I would like to always use up-to-date tidy version to catch problems, but OTOH, if each version changes formatting, it's not that usable to minimizing differences between versions of HTML document stored in CVS, which is the primary use for me.  </s>
<s> - Volodya  </s>
<s> No, there is no 4th indenting option.  </s>
<s> In fact, the new "auto" mode fixes a number of problems with the previous version.  </s>
<s> Not problems with compliance, but things that could make visual changes in browsers.  </s>
<s> Also, we received a steady stream of complaints about too many blank lines.  </s>
<s> An excellent idea which, unfortunately, will not work this time.  </s>
<s> You could continue to use Tidy, but will incur a one-time monster diff.  </s>
<s> Just thinking out loud here but, for this use, I'd suggest --indent no.  </s>
<s> You could use --indent auto before you work on it and --indent no before you check it in.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
