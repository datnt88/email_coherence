<s> I have been reading through the W3C mail archives and I must say that all this horizontal scrolling is annoying.  </s>
<s> Do you think that using the PRE element for messages is a good idea?  </s>
<s> Obviously, many mail clients do not wrap the text.  </s>

<s> It's much more annoying for people to have their  </s>

<s> The problem doesn't come from the pre, but from broken mail clients that allow to have lines bigger than 78 characters.  </s>

<s> Can you elaborate on that a little?  </s>
<s> So we can know what we (and our mail clients) are doing wrong and can avoid the problem in the future?  </s>
<s> I noticed the problem happens on messages from me when I use Outlook  </s>
<s> 2002, but not Outlook 2000 or Mac Mail.  </s>
<s> Looking at the messages, Outlook 2002 and 2000 both claim to be doing quoted-printable, and both are wrapping lines at 78 characters or less, but 2002 messages have an "=" at the end of each paragraph while 2000 (and other clients I've observed) use "=" or "=20" for soft breaks within a paragraph.  </s>
<s> So an Outlook 2000 paragraph looks like (hoping the "=" doesn't get lost): 1 .................78 This is a wrapped = paragraph sent = from Outlook 2000.  </s>
<s> (Don't remember if there is a final "=" or not.) An Outlook 2002 paragraph looks like: 1 .................78 This is a wrapped paragraph sent from Outlook 2002.=  </s>
<s> My raw message viewer doesn't let me distinguish line endings, so I'm not sure about CRLF vs CR vs LF. Oddly, if a sysadmin looks at my message at the SMTP gateway, the 2002 message looks like the 2000 message (it has "=" at the end of each line), so I'm still investigating.  </s>
<s> Thanks for any information.  </s>

<s> Just to add some information (and test my theory by posting to the list), I have noticed that the problematic messages (no soft breaks) from Outlook 2002 seem to only occur when the encoding is us-ascii.  </s>
<s> If I force the encoding to something else like utf-8 or iso-8859-1 by either including a non-ascii character or telling Outlook to not auto-select the encoding, then it seems to wrap correctly with soft breaks.  </s>

<s> Looks like forcing iso-8859-1 didn't help for the wrapping on the list archive.  </s>
<s> Trying the same message with utf8 (again from outlook 2002).  </s>

<s> The last message still went out with iso-8859-1, perhaps because I created it by forwarding an iso-8859-1 message.  </s>
