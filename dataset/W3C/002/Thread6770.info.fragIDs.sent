I register a _very_ minor quibble with the way the altlocs list is rendered. 
I find "a, b, and c" very odd, particularly when the list members are short, as in "XML, Schema, and DTD". 
I much prefer "a, b and c", i.e. "XML, Schema and DTD". 
Alternatively, give me a template rule and I'll override both the rule and the elt decl and make altlocs be mixed content and then I can suit myself!

I tend to use the Oxford comma myself: too much risk of ambiguity otherwise in lists such as "Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Waterstones". 
To me, "XML, Schema and DTD" reads like a list of two things not of three. 
But then I tend to follow Fowler in such matters.

Ditto. Oxford rules chez moi.

Like Tim and Michael, I prefer the Oxford style, but never let it be said I tried to coerce you :-) 
Here's a stylesheet layer on top of 1.3 that does it the way you want. 
In 1.4, I'll have things refactored so you can override just the altlocs template. 
I don't know what I was thinking (yes, I do, I was thinking "how fast can I make this work" so that the Namespaces WD can get past pubrules).

Thanks for your gracious response. 
I had already done something similar.
