<s> Dear spec-prod subscribers, I'm quite new to this list; maybe my questions were answered earlier and I missed it (i took a short look at the archives...)  </s>
<s> I'm working on a project with the German W3C Office in order to translate all of the W3C Recommendations to German.  </s>
<s> Additionaly to the translation we want the translators to add annotations to make the specs more understandable (sorry ;-), maybe to add some specific German information.  </s>
<s> For example: if XML supports Unicode, what does it mean for German umlauts?  </s>
<s> Questions like that shall be answered in the non normative annotations.  </s>
<s> We want to write all translations in XML according to the spec DTD (I already translated two RECs using my own DTD).  </s>
<s> Currently I begin to use spec DTD 2.1 (downloaded from My questions are - is this the latest version of spec DTD? - if not, where can I find the latest version?  </s>
<s> - yes, i can make my own version of spec DTD that would include an element named non-normative-annotation for example.  </s>
<s> but would it be possible to include such an element in the official spec DTD? if yes, I would like to participate in the discussion of the needs for an extension to the spec DTD.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for an answer!  </s>

<s> Hello Stefan,  </s>
<s> This would, of course, be a *great* XLink application: Write the annotations separately, then make extended links that emanate from the specification and generate clickable text and pop-ups.  </s>
<s> Tim Bray did this in a fairly simple fashion for his Annotated XML Specification; I doubt his code has been maintained, but it might be a useful place to start if you're interested, and I think it's available (or at least a description of the process is) at XML.com.  </s>
<s> But since you're "touching" the source files anyway, it's not so bad to introduce new text directly into them.  </s>
<s> Yes, V2.1 is currently the latest.  </s>
<s> You can always get the latest version from http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.dtd.  </s>
<s> An interesting idea.  </s>
<s> What do people think about building a "layered annotation" facility right into the DTD?  </s>
<s> Personally, as an XML Linking co-chair and XLink editor, I'd rather see an extended-link application.  </s>
<s> :-) For the moment, if you want to use the DTD without modification, you could perhaps use the note element with a role attribute of "non-normative-annotation", and then make your stylesheet behave differently for those notes.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion!  </s>

<s> Hello Eve and Stefan, We have an on-going annotation experiment with Amaya that may answer your needs.  </s>
<s> It allows you to annotate any document (we're using XLink and XPointer to specify the endpoints of the annotation), store the annotations in a generic RDF database, and then merge them into the document again.  </s>
<s> You can declare one or more databases or also use local annotations, without the overhead of the database.We  </s>

<s> We expect to ship a first version of the system in the October release of Amaya.  </s>

<s> Cheers, -Jose  </s>
