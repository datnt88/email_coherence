Dear spec-prod subscribers, I'm quite new to this list; maybe my questions were answered earlier and I missed it (i took a short look at the archives...) 
I'm working on a project with the German W3C Office in order to translate all of the W3C Recommendations to German. 
Additionaly to the translation we want the translators to add annotations to make the specs more understandable (sorry ;-), maybe to add some specific German information. 
For example: if XML supports Unicode, what does it mean for German umlauts? 
Questions like that shall be answered in the non normative annotations. 
We want to write all translations in XML according to the spec DTD (I already translated two RECs using my own DTD). 
Currently I begin to use spec DTD 2.1 (downloaded from My questions are - is this the latest version of spec DTD? - if not, where can I find the latest version? 
- yes, i can make my own version of spec DTD that would include an element named non-normative-annotation for example. 
but would it be possible to include such an element in the official spec DTD? if yes, I would like to participate in the discussion of the needs for an extension to the spec DTD. 
Thanks in advance for an answer! 
Greetings from Germany Stefan. 
PS: if you're interested: a web page for my translation project can be found at http://mintert.com/w3c/trans/de/.

Hello Stefan, 
This would, of course, be a *great* XLink application: Write the annotations separately, then make extended links that emanate from the specification and generate clickable text and pop-ups. 
Tim Bray did this in a fairly simple fashion for his Annotated XML Specification; I doubt his code has been maintained, but it might be a useful place to start if you're interested, and I think it's available (or at least a description of the process is) at XML.com. 
But since you're "touching" the source files anyway, it's not so bad to introduce new text directly into them. 
Yes, V2.1 is currently the latest. 
You can always get the latest version from http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.dtd. 
An interesting idea. 
What do people think about building a "layered annotation" facility right into the DTD? 
Personally, as an XML Linking co-chair and XLink editor, I'd rather see an extended-link application. 
:-) For the moment, if you want to use the DTD without modification, you could perhaps use the note element with a role attribute of "non-normative-annotation", and then make your stylesheet behave differently for those notes. 
Thanks for the suggestion!

Hello Eve and Stefan, We have an on-going annotation experiment with Amaya that may answer your needs. 
It allows you to annotate any document (we're using XLink and XPointer to specify the endpoints of the annotation), store the annotations in a generic RDF database, and then merge them into the document again. 
You can declare one or more databases or also use local annotations, without the overhead of the database.We 
demoed the system at the Semantic Web track of WWW9's developper's day. 
We expect to ship a first version of the system in the October release of Amaya. 
The server code will also be available. 
Cheers, -Jose
