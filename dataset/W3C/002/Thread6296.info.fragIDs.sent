<s> All: I do not agree with the direction we are taking with attributes in WSDL 2.0  </s>
<s> working group.  </s>
<s> My reasons include: a) Forcing the designer to use Get/Set operation pairs to denote attributes  </s>
<s> results in a model of very fine grained access.  </s>
<s> b) The approach is quite complicated, this reduces the functionality/capability of tools to support this approach ubiquitously.  </s>
<s> c) The approach does not allow/support addition of policy/meta-data specifically associated with the attributes.  </s>
<s> Therefore I request that the WSDL WG reconsider its position on attributes and terminate this line of activity.  </s>
<s> The concept of attributes in Web services should be done in another venue that would allow a simpler and more complete treatment of this concept.  </s>

<s> But I completely agree with your conclusion.  </s>
<s> I think that the service state and management space is a very interesting one, and there are some simple and powerful things that can be done there, things which seem like perfect candidates for WSDL extensions.  </s>

<s> Hi David,  </s>
<s> made  </s>
<s> You know only too well that for the last few months Jim Webber and I have been arguing against the perceived requirement that SDEs are necessary in the Grid community, even more so about the view that they must be introduced in WSDL in one form or the other (e.g., as attributes).  </s>
<s> Service Data Declarations appear to be powerful only because of the OGSI view of the world, where each resource is exposed as a Grid Service Instance and where consumers are allowed to create or request the destruction of a Grid Service Instance.  </s>
<s> My limited understanding of WSA tells me that seeing each resource as a Grid Service Instance, which is defined as a potentially transient, stateful Web Service with lifetime management related characteristics, is not consistent with the Service-Oriented model but, rather, with an object-oriented model similar to CORBA and DCOM.  </s>
<s> If the Grid community wishes to define separate specifications that add additional characteristics like Service Data Elements, factories of resources (it's my understanding that we are moving away from the term Grid Service Instance in favour for "Resource"), they are free to do so.  </s>
<s> However, I am worried that such an approach will further distance the Grid from the world of Web Services without actually that being necessary.  </s>
<s> Best regards, .savas.  </s>
