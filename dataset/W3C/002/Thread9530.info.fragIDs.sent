<s> Of the issue resolutions currently in the draft 1.67 I am only uneasy with: rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr Action: The grammar has[will be] been modified to forbid the use of an rdf:ID attribute when a rdf:resource attribute is also given.  </s>
<s> This removes an ambiguity of which statement is reified but is relatively harmless since the statement can be precisely reified  </s>
<s> using the non-empty version of the property element with an rdf:Description block  </s>
<s> I prefer to go other way, to allow an rdf:ID on any propertyElt production and to uniformly understand it as reifying the triple created by that propertyElt.  </s>
<s> (Personally I don't see the ambiguity referred to in your text).  </s>
<s> Is the intent of your text to delete para 232, i.e. we forbid reading the rdf:ID on some propertyElt's as something other than a reification?  </s>
<s> Should your text (the intent) read: when a rdf:resource attribute is also *possible*.  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I have had a look over revision 1.67 and wanted to make a few points about the syntactic rules.  </s>
<s> Left-to-right priority A | B | ...  </s>
<s> In the one case where I think you're relying on this, it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> I suggest dropping it; such procedural readings are usually asking for trouble.  </s>
<s> I'll give an example of how it doesn't work and then give two different solutions (that do?  </s>
<s> ;) ).  </s>
<s> e.g. (without namespaces) The propertyElt ' rdf:value rdf:parseType="Resource" String /rdf:value ' does match parseTypeOtherPropertyElt and does not match parseTypeResourcePropertyElt.  </s>
<s> It makes no difference that parseTypeResourcePropertyElt comes first, it doesn't match.  </s>
<s> Solution 1 (my preference) Drop parseTypeOther altogether.  </s>
<s> It won't make any difference in practice to what implementations do.  </s>
<s> It is not the job of a spec to specify how implementations should handle bad input unless it specifically gives future compatibility.  </s>
<s> I do not believe that specifying rdf:parseType="foo bar" gives that.  </s>
<s> Solution 2 (probably also helpful anyway) Text like: "The productions propertyAttr and parseOther which match attributes  </s>
<s> with arbitrary values (CDATA) do not match any attribute which is more specifically matched by any other production in the grammar."  </s>
<s> I note that without this text the perverted could have a reading of emptyNode matching rdf:Description rdf:ID="foo" rdf:about="#bar" rdf:aboutEach="#fooBar" / where we have one specific attribute (I don't know which one) and two propertyAttr's.  </s>
<s> That is deliberately misreading the spec.  </s>
<s> and I don't think it's important.  </s>
<s> Merging of empty property elt productions It is unclear which way we're going with triple production.  </s>
<s> If we leave it completely out of a schema which specifies legal RDF/XML then the three productions emptyPropertyElt, emptyParseTypeLiteralPropertyElt and emptyParseTypeResourcePropertyElt can be merged into: start_element([namespace_name]=any, [local_name]=any, [attribtues]=set(idAttr?,parseLiteral?,parseResource?) end_element()  </s>
<s> parseType=Resource of course does produce rather different triples ...  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Jeremy Carroll said:  </s>
<s> Which I wrote just so people could argue / support.  </s>
<s> Plus I own this issue and want to close it.  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> There has patently been plenty of implementer and WG confusion given previous long threads discussing this artifact, lack of coherent implementation and use, so I was proposing a clarification by removing it, since it can be done another way.  </s>
<s> In addition, it is consistent with the recent rdf:ID="attr" abbreviates rdf:about="#attr" near-decision; since this rdf:ID doesn't do that, it is an alternative for rdf:resource The existing grammar says very complex things near "r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new resource.  </s>
<s> If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new resource."  </s>
<s> so the following example is illegal in RDF/XML M&amp;S 1.0 rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:ex="http://example.org/schema#" since rdf:ID and rdf:resource are alternatives.  </s>
<s> I am not doing any deletion on old text, but constructing a new one.  </s>
<s> However, I was proposing not allowing rdf:ID in the new grammar in this place, to ease the confusion and consistent with the rdf:ID/rdf:about choice.  </s>
<s> The rdf:ID above is on a property that introduces 2 statements (in my example; can be more with extra property attributes) so can't reify both.  </s>
<s> It could reify one, but this abbreviated form still seems rather odd.  </s>
<s> I'd rather you proposed this as change rather than ask me to justify why you want it!  </s>
<s> Replacing your proposed change Action: The grammar has[will be] been modified to forbid the use of an rdf:ID attribute when a rdf:resource attribute is also possible.  </s>
<s> This removes an ambiguity of which statement is reified but is relatively harmless since the statement can be precisely reified using the non-empty version of the property element with an rdf:Description block Hmm, I don't like that at all actually.  </s>
<s> Maybe: Action: The grammar has[will be] been modified to forbid the use of an rdf:ID attribute on an empty property element.  </s>
<s> This is consistent with using rdf:ID="attr" as an abbreviation for rdf:about="#attr" and removes the suggestion that it reifys a statement, which it never did in the original grammar form.  </s>

<s> I said I hadn't started hacking that section so, I'm answering quickly  </s>
<s> In short: I'm deleting this.  </s>
<s> It was a last minute pre-WD change that I did and regretted, confirmed with subsequent emails on www-rdf-comments.  </s>
<s> Yeah; the words here should be more of a hint - qnames thing that came up recently, might appear.  </s>
<s> Yeah, maybe I'll merge that in.  </s>
<s> There are plenty of silly things that could be done, I'm not sure whether to ban rdf:Description as a property etc. or just not provide a meaning for them.  </s>
<s> Going for latter at present.  </s>
<s> I was going to remove the empty* terms into the, for example, parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt and then have words saying if [children] is empty then A else B.  </s>
<s> Yeah, really a very different thing Thanks Dave  </s>
<s> Very nice Dave!  </s>
<s> I just have a few comments from version 1.69.  </s>
<s> WRT the issues in Appendix A, some issues that have not had a WG decision have an Action that implies (to me) a WG decision has been made (e.g. rdfms-replace-value).  </s>
<s> I realize you consider this your "strawman" but all WG memebers should realize that the doc implies more decisions have been made than really have.  </s>
<s> Instead of Action, perhaps it would be useful to use Status and then to assign a status value such as: Decided - Change, Decided - No Change, Undecided (instead of '?').  </s>
<s> In the case where a decision was made, supporting text would be added.  </s>
<s> As I've stated before I like the apparent simplicity and clarity of the RelaxNG non-XML schema.  </s>
<s> I do wonder, however, how we verify this schema or any other schemas that may be added to Appendix D (the document says XML Schema and Schematron are TODOs).  </s>
<s> It seems like the schemas in Appendix D should explicitly state whether or  </s>
<s> not they are normative.  </s>
<s> Also, do we really need to provide more than one schema; what about just pointing to the work of James and Rick instead of including their work in the document?  </s>
<s> Since a lot of the text in section 6 of the M&amp;S specifies triple creations, it seems like extreme care will be needed to assure all of the relevant text in that section is transfered to the new doc.  </s>
<s> Also, what do you expect to document wrt triple generation versus what do you expect to get from the Snail work?  </s>
<s> I prefer a pointer.  </s>
<s> I think it's great work, but when I looked at it, I found at least one bug in the relax-ng thingy; I haven't even found time to report it.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to have it copied into our WD only if, say, three members of this WG are willing to vouch for it; i.e. to say "yes, I've looked at it and it agrees with the rest of the spec".  </s>
<s> I could live with copying it into the WD only with a strong disclaimer ala "this may have bugs.  </s>
<s> We're pretty sure it does have bugs.  </s>
<s> But it's nifty, so we're including it here so folks can help us work out the bugs."  </s>
<s> Of course, that's pretty close to a commitment to address any comments made on this relax-NG schema.  </s>
<s> Dave, are you prepared to address such comments?  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly said:  </s>
<s> Two votes for a pointer - I'm changing it and adding links to the schematron one too, adding non normative words.  </s>
<s> I can't vouch for it at this time.  </s>
<s> No. I also have to ask James' permission to include it.  </s>
<s> Change made to as of CVS version 1.72 or later Dave  </s>
<s> Art Barstow said:  </s>
<s> It would need more than that.  </s>
<s> There are issues with WG decisions to change, not change, issues not considered.  </s>
<s> WG decisions have words.  </s>
<s> The action is the action that was beholden on this document in order to address the issue.  </s>
<s> I think all the WG decisions are recorded as such.  </s>
<s> The WG may decide that the actions I give are suitable to address the issue in which case a "On date, the WG decided URI-of-action addressed the issue" text could be added.  </s>
<s> [RelaxNG inclusion gone, see other reply]  </s>
<s> I'm going to try careful prose and n-triples, see how it goes.  </s>
<s> I suggested to Jeremy to maybe include the snail rules work (non-XSLT part) in a separate section and ask for implementor feedback.  </s>
<s> My worry is slight disconnect between stream of sax events and the actual ntriples out, using Jeremys approach.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, gives very precise, complete, coherent answers which my prose may not, which was the main problem we were addressing with a new syntax formalism.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Dave, As you requested yesterday I have had a look at some of the issues remaining unresolved in revision 1.88.  </s>
<s> I've had a go at three of them, and attach my proposals.  </s>
<s> The issues I address are: #rdfms-abouteach #rdfms-reification-required #rdfms-nested-bagIDs I continue to duck xml:base.  </s>
<s> Personally I would allow it everywhere!  </s>
<s> But I believe that is out of kilter with WG consensus.  </s>
<s> I certainly feel that we cannot prohibit it outside RDF content: for example, on an xhtml document with embedded metadata.  </s>
<s> In such a case, we should honour it.  </s>
<s> Also xml:base is legal within an embedded XML Literal.  </s>
<s> Given this, it seems natural to allow it on the rdf:RDF element.  </s>
<s> Requiring conformant implementations to handle all of that we might as well go the whole hog and be completely permissive.  </s>
<s> This would make up for deficiencies in the syntax of not having uri-reference versions of reification and rdf:bagID by wait for it ... rdf:Description rdf:bagID="BagID" xml:base="http://example.org/bagID/URI#" OK, OK, I know that I'll lose this one.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Hi Dave  </s>
<s> With the danger of rushing in before you've reached anything like a stable point ...  </s>
<s> I have had a look at version 1.88 and I am decidedly nervous about the direction you're going with the triple production stuff.  </s>
<s> I fear you're heading for a rerun of M&amp;S section 6 with: + too many words + that are self-contradictory and + too unclear I am also less than taken with the view that the text describing the production should be associated with a particular processing model.  </s>
<s> For instance in the subsection "Production node" you say The following processing is performed before handling any propertyEltList children and in this order.  </s>
<s> That is presumably intended in an abstract processing model.  </s>
<s> It is in my view, perfectly legal to process the property attribtues after the property elements, and the resulting n-triple file is an acceptable rendition of the RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> I would go further and say that the property attributes and property elements can be processed in any order with the single exception that rdf:li is converted into rdf:_NNN in document order.  </s>
<s> I also dislike the "in this order" part since many of the steps you then list are, in fact, interchangeable.  </s>
<s> I fear we have a stylistic clash brewing.  </s>
<s> I feel that it is better if a specification does not over-specify by indicating superfluous things; whereas you appear to want a specification that would have helped you write the particular implementation of RDF/XML that you have in mind.  </s>
<s> I do not feel that it is the job of a specification to assist a parser writer.  </s>
<s> The job of a specification is to specify what needs specifying (and no more or less).  </s>
<s> If at any point there is a conflict between the task of assisting the reader in their task (e.g. writing a parser), and the principle aim of specifying I am clear that the reader should be left to seek assistance elsewhere.  </s>
<s> The reader should expect clarity from a spec, if they want a howto then they may need a different document.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Jeremy Carroll said:  </s>
<s> Yes, very much so.  </s>
<s> I asked you to produce an order.  </s>
<s> While waiting I typed ol and li for things I thought of.  </s>
<s> My feeling is we ought to list ordering dependencies for our target audience who are parser writers, and produce something that is directed from the syntax = triples as quickly as possible.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Sorry Dave:  </s>
<s> I attach some text ... It's really intended as an overview of what processing is needed to unpack the full RDF/XML syntax.  </s>
<s> As such I try to give some explanation of what each step is, and their interdependencies.  </s>
<s> I have underlined bits that directly relate to the order of processing.  </s>
<s> I note that my rule 17 is stricter than this text, I think that it is a bug with my rules.  </s>
<s> Also my rules aren't quite as liberal with bagID numbering as the attached text.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I strongly agree with this.  </s>
<s> Specs should inform, but not constrain any more than absolutely required.  </s>
<s> If there is a neat way to help a newbie get a parser (or whatever ) written, then put that in a primer or expert-guide document, but not in the spec itself.  </s>

<s> I agree as well, but with the caveat that those other documents need to be written too!  </s>
<s> They don't necessarily have to be products of the WG  </s>
<s> (although they can be), but if the folks that know the specs best (which we hope at least *include* those that write them!) also know things about pitfalls (in either meaning or implementation) that readers/users of the specs are likely to fall into (typically because the writers have fallen into them themselves), or have other useful guidance that could be provided, ideally that *should* be provided (in clearly separate material).  </s>
