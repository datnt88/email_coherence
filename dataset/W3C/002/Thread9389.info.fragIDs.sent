I am pleased to announce that the WD has been published: Refactoring RDF/XML Syntax, W3C Working Draft, 06 September 2001 
Dave 
Good stuff, that, Dave. 
I'm particularly happy with the long list of references; I think it shows that we've been paying attention to what's going on in the field of specifying XML-based syntaxes, and I hope it serves as an invitation for folks working on all that stuff to collaborate.

I forgot to say - thanks to Art (and his helpers) for helping me with getting this through the W3C publishing process. 
I think this was done rather quick considering we were both new at this. 
Dave 
A really nice job. 
Congratulations to all.

WooHoo! :) Brian 
Yeah -- excellent work everyone, 'specially Dave :) This is a big step forward towards 'industrial strength RDF', and something everyone in the RDF developer community has been looking forward to for years. 
Dave, could you send a note to www-rdf-interest announcing this?
