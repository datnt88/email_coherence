For those of us who will be at WWW2002, do we want to arrange some particular time to get together (dinner, beer, whatever)?

I'll be there and would love to meet up with people. 
Maybe we can start "Get'cher royalty-free, hot-off-the-presses RDF Core specifications! 
Latest news on datatyping!" [Did somebody say knife-fights?]

I'll pack my full body armor and big stick ;-) Patrick

I'll be there too (so will others who haven't declared yet) Maybe meet the evening of the 7th (tutorial/workshop day)? 
There is usually a noticeboard for such messages. 
See ya Dave
