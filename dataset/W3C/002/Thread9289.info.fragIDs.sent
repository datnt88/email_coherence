<s> Hi Dave,  </s>

<s> String Escaping it's fixed now at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/#27.015  </s>
<s> I have no knowledge about CVS, but we wondered to use if that's OK with you  </s>
<s> Thanks for the test case!  </s>

<s> That's was the idea; I also got caught by the optional space allowed before the final '.'  </s>
<s> It is OK to link there for now; I just pointed that out so when I made changes, you could get the latest copy.  </s>
<s> By the way I heartly recommend CVS - check it out at http://cvshome.org/  </s>
