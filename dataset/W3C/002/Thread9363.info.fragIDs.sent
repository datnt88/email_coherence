Hey, the following thought occurred to me. 
Is it legal to use a 
uriref in an RDF triple, where the uriref is the URL of the document in which the triple appears? 
In other words, can a piece of RDF refer to itself? 
If so, what could it possibly mean? 
In case anyone is wondering, the issue arises when one starts playing with Jos deRoo's entailment examples, which have triples which talk about RDF documents.

Isn't this where we have to be extra careful about use/mention distinctions? 
(Echos of Larry's draft: does it mean the document, the content of the document or something described by the document?)

I just tried such a case ==== etc001.n3 
[] etc:supportsProofOf [ etc:blunt test001.nt , test002.nt , test003.nt , etc001.n3 ; # self-reference etc:kind rdf-rules.n3 
, 
rdfs-rules.n3 ; etc:sharp test004.nt 
] . 
and that works fine and could actually (maybe) be useful in case etc001 contains additional facts to support the entailment test case (which is not the case here) no? 
it seems to be very similar to the thing/ectension distinction isn't it? 
Jos 
OK, how about this: ====etc002.n3 
[]etc:supportsProofOf [etc:blunt etc002.n3 ; etc:kind rdf-rules.n3 
; etc:sharp etc002.n3 
] . 
? 
My guess is it ought to either immediately succeed, or else recurse forever, depending on which way your code has its main loop nested :-)

Does DAML do this? 
Hmmm, yes it does. 
In: I find: 
daml:versionInfo $Id: daml+oil-ex.daml,v 
1.9 2001/05/03 16:38:38 mdean Exp $ /daml:versionInfo An example ontology, with data types taken from XML Schema The 'rdf:about=""' refers to current document. 
Is that what you meant Pat? 
Brian 
Yup - we are headed into "what exactly is a resource" territory here. 
Lets do datatypes first. 
Brian 
it recurses, but not forever... i.e. 
I guess till after some resources are exhausted (so it comes back after 8 seconds on my PC here and without proof) I will think about an Euler path for that Jos 
Right, exactly.

Yes, though I wasn't thinking of that kind of 'labelling' use, which of course is ubiquitous. 
To see what I was thinking about, see the messages to Jos. Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu
