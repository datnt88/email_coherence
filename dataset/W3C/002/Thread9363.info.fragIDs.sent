<s> Hey, the following thought occurred to me.  </s>
<s> Is it legal to use a  </s>
<s> uriref in an RDF triple, where the uriref is the URL of the document in which the triple appears?  </s>
<s> In other words, can a piece of RDF refer to itself?  </s>
<s> If so, what could it possibly mean?  </s>
<s> In case anyone is wondering, the issue arises when one starts playing with Jos deRoo's entailment examples, which have triples which talk about RDF documents.  </s>

<s> Isn't this where we have to be extra careful about use/mention distinctions?  </s>
