<s> To whom this may concern,  </s>
<s> I have downloaded TIDYGUI.exe file(1.1.5 4th August 2000 version), and run it.  </s>
<s> First I browse to the source html file, then leave the configuration button alone, click the 'Tidy!' button, the screen shows how many warnings/errors were found, but when I click the 'show output' button, it pop up a blank Tidy Output screen, is this the way it should be ?  </s>
<s> Or I need to specify somewhere the output file location?  </s>
<s> If there is nothing shows on the Tidy Output screen, why and how can I use  </s>
<s> the 'Save as' button to save whatever the output  </s>

<s> Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.  </s>

<s> I don't know anything about "TIDYGUI.exe"  </s>
<s> but if Tidy encounters errors in the document it won't pretty print the document.  </s>
<s> Maybe you try a more simple example document.  </s>
<s> Hello list,  </s>
<s> I downloaded the Tidy.exe utility to test what Tidy does or doesn't.  </s>
<s> I tried the following: tidy -asxml foo.html foo.out.html  </s>
<s> in the command windows tidy seems to parse the foo.html document and does show an xhtml valid version of it, the thing is, it doesn't update the foo.out.html file with the tidied version.  </s>
<s> The same happens if I use  </s>
<s> tidy -asxml foo.html -o foo.out.html or tidy -asxml foo.html -out foo.out.html  </s>
<s> The same happens when I use a config file instead of the -asxml directive, the foo.out.html is not updated.  </s>
<s> tidy -config optionfile.txt  </s>
<s> foo.html -o foo.out.html  </s>
<s> What's wrong?  </s>

<s> This is supposed to tidy both, foo.html and foo.out.html.  </s>
<s> Use -m if you want to have foo.html modified.  </s>
<s> This is supposed to tidy foo.html, -out and foo.out.html.  </s>
<s> Use tidy -asxml -out foo.out.html foo.html  </s>
<s> tidy foo.html, -o and foo.out.html.  </s>
