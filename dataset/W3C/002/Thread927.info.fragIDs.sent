To whom this may concern, 
I have downloaded TIDYGUI.exe file(1.1.5 4th August 2000 version), and run it. 
First I browse to the source html file, then leave the configuration button alone, click the 'Tidy!' button, the screen shows how many warnings/errors were found, but when I click the 'show output' button, it pop up a blank Tidy Output screen, is this the way it should be ? 
Or I need to specify somewhere the output file location? 
If there is nothing shows on the Tidy Output screen, why and how can I use 
the 'Save as' button to save whatever the output 
document? 
Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you. 
Please reply to both of my e-mail address: 1) thewangs@comcast.net 2) swang@carebridge.com

I don't know anything about "TIDYGUI.exe" 
but if Tidy encounters errors in the document it won't pretty print the document. 
Maybe you try a more simple example document. 
Hello list, 
I downloaded the Tidy.exe utility to test what Tidy does or doesn't. 
I tried the following: tidy -asxml foo.html foo.out.html 
in the command windows tidy seems to parse the foo.html document and does show an xhtml valid version of it, the thing is, it doesn't update the foo.out.html file with the tidied version. 
The same happens if I use 
tidy -asxml foo.html -o foo.out.html or tidy -asxml foo.html -out foo.out.html 
The same happens when I use a config file instead of the -asxml directive, the foo.out.html is not updated. 
tidy -config optionfile.txt 
foo.html -o foo.out.html 
What's wrong?

This is supposed to tidy both, foo.html and foo.out.html. 
Use -m if you want to have foo.html modified. 
This is supposed to tidy foo.html, -out and foo.out.html. 
Use tidy -asxml -out foo.out.html foo.html 
tidy foo.html, -o and foo.out.html. 
The order of the arguments. 
thanks again.

Okay, thank you! so in the case I use the configuration file, the line would look 
like 
Yes.

Hello again, I just tried to use tidy.exe with a config file and the results are not as 
expected. the line I used is as suggested: tidy -config optionfile.txt 
-o foo.out.html foo.html the option file looks like this: add-xml-decl=yes 
bare=yes clean=yes drop-font-tags=yes drop-propietary-attributes=yes indent=auto indent-spaces=2 wrap=72 markup=yes output-xml=yes input-xml=no show-warnings=yes numeric-entities=yes quote-marks=yes quote-nbsp=yes quote-ampersand=no break-before-br=no uppercase-tags=no uppercase-attributes=no smart-indent=no output-xhtml=yes char-encoding=latin1 join-styles=yes word-2000=yes the output file looks like this: meta content= "HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st February 2003), see www.w3.org" td img src= "file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/lizet/My%20Documents/My%20Pictures/dust%20storms% 20of%202001.jpg" 
width="350" height="350" /td as you see the img tag is not closed properly and it gets closed when I run tidy with the -asxml option instead of using a configuration file. 
Is the -asxml directive the equivalent to output-xml=yes in the option file? 
If not, what am I setting wrong in the option file?

Apparently, = is not supported to separate names from values, use ':' instead. 
Thanks again, it worked fine.
