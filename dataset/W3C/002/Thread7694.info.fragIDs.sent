<s> A server is always free to return extra properties since clients are always able to tell if a response contains the properties they are interested in.  </s>
<s> A client that fails in this scenario would be properly viewed as broken as, even if the standard prohibited returning extra properties, a real world client MUST be flexible enough to handle a broken server that did the wrong thing in this case.  </s>

<s> I realize that a server returning extra properties could be considered a D.O.S. attack but since the server is the "service" and since the client can kill the TCP connection, I find this argument to be a bit strained.  </s>
