Hello, 
I wondered why there is a label used to identify the form controls such as the search field which does not provide any actual labelling, just an accesskey which could be attached directly to the form control in question?

Thanks for the idea, Charles. 
The labels were added in revision 4.716 when the tables were removed in favor of CSS. 
It's been a while but think I copied them from WDG. Did I get them wrong?

At Sidar we believe that the requirement to have default place holder text in search fields no longer holds, and causes some usability problems for people with motor disabilities. 
Although we have not been able to get a response from the WCAG group as to whether or not they believe that checkpoint 10.3 - Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas [1] - applies we would therefore suggest the following: label for="inputField" Search W3C input type="...." etc="etc" / /label (We would also recommend not putting the search into the taborder with a tabindex different to the one it would naturally get - i.e. in order to change its tab ordering, move it on the page). 
I'm interested in your view on this approach.

All of this seems reasonable. 
I have made these changes. 
Would you please check to see that they are correct? 
This mailing list is not the venue for making changes to WCAG, though. 
I suggest that you contact WAI again about the search field text. 
Thanks for writing, Charles, Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/ 
Hi Susan, yes, what you have now is what we would generally recommend at Fundaci?n Sidar. 
I realise that neither of us are able to unilaterally make pronouncements on behalf of WCAG, but was interested in your experience with a site that gets a lot of hits (and presumably lots of feedback). 
cheers Chaals
