Here's part of a coworker's response to my ftf trip report: 
I'm sure this is a picky point, but it took me a long time to figure out that "c14n" was "canonicalization". 
Ok, convenient short-hand for informal communication. 
But, it's actually in a tag in the spec, c14nalg . 
Yikes! Yet, we have transformations instead of t12ns , and the fairly ubiquitous term "signature" which could be replaced with "s7e". 
The people who thought this up could probably also save a lot of space/typing my storing only two digits for year values. 
While I don't feel that strongly on the issue, XML is supposed to be readable. 
I don't think the twelve bytes saved per signature are significant enough to warrant the abbreviation. 
But then, my favorite applications aren't particularly sensitive to size.

c14n is quite common in the Web community and spreads like a virus once 
people first see it. 
comes from i18n (internationalization), can be generalized for A(X-3)ion words.

That's what I had responded to my coworker (I have been involved in i18n in the past). 
However, it "feels inappropriate" to me to use the abbreviation in the standard, but as I said I don't feel strongly about it. 
My thinking is that "c14n" is pretty opaque for somebody who isn't familiar with that 
method of abbreviation, and since there isn't a need to abbreviate we should 
spell it out. 
I wouldn't argue anything that you've said.

I agree with Mark. 
There nothing wrong with xNNy type stuff in our informal discussions or early drafts but I don't think they shouldappear in any final documents.
