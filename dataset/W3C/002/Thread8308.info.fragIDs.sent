<s> Hi, I've been thinking about the best way to get the BIND spec out without neglecting the fact that the interaction between locks and multiple bindings could use a clarification :-) Several approaches come to mind...: 1) Add a section to the BIND spec.  </s>
<s> From a procedural point of view that would be easiest, but it would IMHO be short-sighted.  </s>
<s> The aforementioned  </s>
<s> clarification should be independant of the BIND spec, and in particular needs to be compatible to whatever RFC2518bis will say when it's finished.  </s>
<s> 2) Come up with a separate spec that updates RFC2518 and just summarizes all that we changed or intend to change regarding locking (like  </s>
<s> deprecation of lock-null resources, fixes to LOCK and lock refresh, If header syntax, and lockdiscovery extensions).  </s>
<s> That would still be a "draft standard" as RFC2518, but it would make things easier for RFC2518bis as well, because all these changes would be written down in a  </s>
<s> spec that came out prior to the revision, so wouldn't be "new" anymore.  </s>
<s> It would also encourage implementors to actually *implement* these changes and extensions *before* RFC2518bis comes out.  </s>
<s> 3) A drastic approach would be to de-couple locking entirely from RFC2518 ("updating" RFC2518 again).  </s>
<s> That would look similar to how RFC3253 is organized (locking would become an optional module, and  </s>
<s> everything that needs to be said about locking would reside in that separate document).  </s>
<s> Of course that approach would have a significant impact on RFC2518bis, because optimally, it wouldn't say anything about locking anymore either.  </s>
<s> From a purely technical point of view, choice 3) has a lot of appeal.  </s>
<s> Separating the specs should make both more accessible, the base spec would be MUCH simpler, and both specs would be easier to update.  </s>
<s> Also, getting people to implement basic WebDAV minus locking may be a lot easier if it's decoupled.  </s>
<s> Of course, that's also the option that would cause the biggest amount of editorial work... On the other hand, I'd understand if people think that we shouldn't mess  </s>
<s> around too much with both RFC2518 and RFC2518bis.  </s>
<s> In that case, I see option 2) as a workable alternative.  </s>
<s> Of course, that approach only makes sense if we can make that activity an official WebDAV working group work item.  </s>

<s> It probably is worth making a pass through 2518bis to make sure that all the language that deals with internal members is compatible with bind semantics, but I didn't find any problems of that sort last time I read through 2518bis (but I wasn't specifically looking for that, so I could have missed something).  </s>

<s> Servers that support RFC2518 can always claim support for RFC2518 without changes but most servers support locking anyway and wouldn't find this difficult.  </s>
