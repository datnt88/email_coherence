<s> Well, looking for "webdav" I discovered some more, such as: l/search-adv.htm&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;p=1&amp;p=1&amp;S1=webdav&amp;OS=webdav&amp;RS=webdav:  </s>
<s> "A method is described of converting a file system path corresponding to a resource to a uniform resource locator (URL) corresponding to the resource.  </s>
<s> After receiving the file system path, the following information is obtained related to the resource located in the inputted file system path: the protocol prefix, domain name, the port number if different than default, and the URL fixed subdirectory structure if any.  </s>
<s> This information may be obtained, for example, by reference to a URL provided to a conversion module.  </s>
<s> The URL is then manufactured by first assigning the protocol prefix as the left-most characters of the URL.  </s>
<s> Then, the domain name, a colon ":" and port number if different than default, any subdirectory structure, and a latter portion of the file system path are added to the protocol prefix.  </s>
<s> Finally, any back slashes ".backslash." are converted to forward slashes "/" to complete the conversion to the URL."  </s>
<s> I guess any Web server running on a Windows system violates this one.  </s>
<s> The search also turns up patent claims about ACLs, DASL (SQL) and storing properties in property files.  </s>
<s> Needless to say, all filed by Microsoft in 1999.  </s>
<s> Is this the reason why Microsoft went away from standards work back then?  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> I assume there is prior art to these?  </s>
<s> It's a shame that it got through the patent review process.  </s>
<s> (Not a suprise, however.)  </s>
<s> IANAL.  </s>
<s> Many of the claims in the Microsoft patents are very specific to HTTP, specific methods, and use of XML.  </s>
<s> There is clear prior art for ACL (easy to find drafts in Google that predate the application).  </s>
<s> DASL is a bit tricky -- the first draft did go our before the application, but only by a week.  </s>
<s> Still, we can point to email messages that clearly indicate that people on the patent application were working on the DASL specification.  </s>
<s> I'm also not sure whether revealing the idea of SQL wrapped in XML over HTTP at the public, open DASL working meetings also constitutes disclosure of the invention.  </s>

<s> The reason companies like Microsoft patent this kind of crap is as a defensive measure--I don't think Microsoft typically uses these patents offensively.  </s>
<s> This is the same with IBM and Oracle as well.  </s>
<s> Lots of random crap gets patented, so if IBM (who started the patents war and has more software patents on stupid stuff than any other company) were to come after Microsoft, for example, Microsoft would come back with probably 20,000 patents that IBM has infringed and drown the problem in litigation (and vice versa).  </s>
<s> The value of that Microsoft patent is that demonstrating prior art on that one patent would probably be half a million in litigation costs to invalidate it.  </s>
<s> These obvious patents are like nukes--the big players are afraid of the consequences of launching them, and they don't use them.  </s>
<s> The only people who use this stuff are the little players who have not much in the way of actual software product revenue, with no target for the big players to retaliate against--kind of like terrorists with nukes.  </s>
<s> That's why all of the trouble is caused by random little startups with no products suing everyone for patents on the likes of downloading music over the Internet.  </s>
<s> I'd bet that you could get Microsoft to make the patent available at no cost to implementors of WebDAV if the issue were raised.  </s>
<s> If we actually wanted to use the Translate header, for example, it would clearly be in MSFT's interest to make the patent available freely.  </s>
<s> --Eric  </s>
<s> There used to be a grace period of 1 year after public disclosure for filing.  </s>
<s> Don't know if it is still true, though I don't think the patent procedures have been changed in that area unless it is part of international normalization.  </s>
<s> The big deal is going to be with regard to the IETF rules.  </s>
<s> I don't know when they were updated to require mandatory licensing of anything disclosed or proposed for an IETF standard.  </s>

<s> In this case, I still think we can demonstrate public disclosure.  </s>
<s> The minutes from the August 25, 1998 DASL BOF at the Chicago IETF clearly show a protocol that wraps SQL in XML and uses the SEARCH verb.  </s>
<s> (see the slides) As well, there are minutes from the previous LA IETF that also show this protocol, and these are from a year before filing.  </s>
<s> Additionally, it seems like the VESA case applies here, since DASL was led, and pushed by Microsoft at the time, and the IETF had/has clear IP disclosure rules.  </s>
<s> Again, IANAL.  </s>
