<s> One of the issues Lisa brought up below was not covered in subsequent discussions.  </s>
<s> That issue was what to do about the source property.  </s>
<s> In fhe following recent post It was indicated that at the IETF meeting there was a proposal to drop the source property.  </s>
<s> Julian added that we can pick it up in the next version of WebDAV.  </s>
<s> I'd like to mark it resolved that we will remove the source property.  </s>
<s> I would leave it up to our memories to bring the topic up again in the next version of WebDAV if we value it.  </s>
<s> The thinking is...  </s>
<s> The source property is good.  </s>
<s> But it's under specified and needs work, no interoperability has been determined, and no one has been yelling for it.  </s>
<s> If we remove it from the spec now, the few implementations that support it can remove that support and thus provide us a clean slate to work from when we take another stab at the source property.  </s>
<s> Please speak up if you disagree with this or would like to add to what I've  </s>

<s> To bring our "agenda" up-to-date, here's what I think the largest and hardest issues are for RFC2518 bis: - Whether/how to change the If header rules and syntax - Whether/how to change the source property definition Although the If header has been shown to be interoperable in its simplest form with locktokens, it hasn't been shown to be interoperable in its more advanced forms or with ETags.  </s>
<s> The source property has not had any demonstrated interoperability to my knowledge.  </s>
<s> I'd like to encourage anybody with ideas on what to do with either of these two features to make concrete proposals to the list.  </s>
<s> If your proposal is "leave things the way they are", I'd like to see some discussion on how to meet the requirements for going to proposed standard (how to demonstrate interoperability, and how much interoperability is enough).  </s>
<s> Another ACL draft is expected before the Yokohama cut-off, therefore ACLs will probably also be discussed in Yokohama.  </s>
<s> I'll be asking for a meeting slot.  </s>

<s> If the source property is removed, then how will the server respond to a client that attempts to use DAV on a resource that is not DAV authorable but is derived from other sources?  </s>
<s> What is the interoperability mechanism?  </s>
<s> I would prefer a source Link solution, myself, since that can be supplied in a normal HTTP error response.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, WebDAV needs to solve this issue before progressing on the standards track.  </s>
<s> It cannot simply remove it without abandoning the  </s>
<s> pretense that it handles Web authoring.  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Authoring access to an unprocessed source representation of a resource has been a WebDAV goal from the very beginning (see Section 5.5 of RFC 2291).  </s>
<s> Removing RFC 2518's mechanism for accomplishing this doesn't help reach the goal -- it's just a punt.  </s>
<s> In what way(s) is this mechanism underspecified?  </s>
<s> From my perspective, it provides sufficient information for an authoring client to discover a URL where authoring can take place.  </s>
<s> I assert that, given a few weeks of coding, we could easily demonstrate at least two clients and two servers interoperating on this feature as currently specified.  </s>
<s> There are no obvious technical impediments to doing so.  </s>

<s> The main issues are that  </s>
<s> - the text and examples in the RFC just do not make sense to me (see [1])  </s>
<s> - the source property doesn't offer enough information to display information about the *types* of link relations [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001OctDec/0119.html  </s>
<s> Do you have specific servers and clients in mind?  </s>
<s> If you drop the XLink stuff I support the "source-set" property described in that message as a replacement for the source property; I implemented it a while ago for mod_dav and cadaver and it very works nicely.  </s>
<s> (I started off implementing {DAV:}source but it suffers greatly because of the two issues given above) An alternative would be to retain the "source" property but drop the redundant "src" element and replace it with a "description" element giving a human-readable description of the link as the cdata content.  </s>

<s> Joe,  </s>
<s> I'm happy to have a different format (I've got enough flak promoting XLink-compatible syntax :-).  </s>
<s> My requirements are - must support multiple links - there must be a machine-readable description for the link type - the should be a human-readable description for the link type  </s>
<s> Please post what you're using right now -- we'll probably able to extend if  </s>
<s> necessary.  </s>
<s> Julian  </s>
<s> I just dropped the xlink: from the href attribute, and got rid of the xlink:role attribute entirely, giving e.g.: which should satisfy your first and third requirements; I'm not sure about "machine-readable" link descriptions being mandatory.  </s>
<s> My client doesn't need to understand anything about the link, I just want it to be able to display a menu of "URI: description" choices when there is  1 source available, so that the user can decide.  </s>
<s> (Similarly, the minimum amount of server configuration I'd like to require is saying e.g. "/dav/render.xsl is a source of /dav/*.xml")  </s>
<s> Regards, joe  </s>
<s> Joe, - the point of a machine-readable link type is that a client may be able to offer a better user interface if it knows what kind of link this is.  </s>
<s> For instance, there might be a special "role" for the XSLT file used for creating an HTML presentation of an XML file, and certainly it would be good for client to be able to detect whether one of the sources plays this role.  </s>
<s> No, we don't have to define roles, but it certainly makes sense to have an optional place where they *may* be reported.  </s>
<s> XLink reports them using URIs, and I think so should we. - you have removed the XLink compatible syntax without, but have stayed with the href attribute.  </s>
<s> This makes your format both incompatible with XLink and the standard DAV:href format (which can be used by RFC3253's expand-property REPORT).  </s>
<s> Why did you do this?  </s>
<s> It doesn't make your format simple to process -- it just saves a few characters in the XML representation.  </s>
<s> I think HREFs should either be reported consistent with other WebDAV standards (DAV:href, supported by the expand-property REPORT), or compatible with XLink (which I would personally prefer).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, we can't have both at the same time... Julian  </s>
