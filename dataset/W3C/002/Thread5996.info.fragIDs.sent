<s> I have some confusion as described below ... "Private process" is providing an internal implementation view of a party in a long running business interaction when the party is implementing its behavior using orchestration engine.  </s>
<s> "Private process" is about specifying the activities he takes in responding to an event (which can be receive a particular message or send a particular message).  </s>
<s> The process variables, routing decisions... etc, describe the detail implementation logic is clearly specified.  </s>
<s> The modeling language (e.g. BPEL, BPML) is semantically equivalent to a flow chart.  </s>
<s> "Public process" is providing an external view of a party in a long running business interaction regardless of whether that party is implementing his behavior using an orchestration engine.  </s>
<s> Public process is about specifying all possible states of that party.  </s>
<s> And then for each state, what events are legitimate (event can be receive a particular message or send a particular message) ?  </s>
<s> And after that, what is all the "possible" next states ?  </s>
<s> The major difference is "public process" is NOT to describe which route to take under what conditions.  </s>
<s> Instead, it describe what are the possibilities.  </s>
<s> It seems to me a "state transition diagram" is a natural fit to describe the "public process".  </s>
<s> Therefore, I have a question if the "public process" should be based on a completely different model (a "state transition diagram") than the "private process" (a "flow chart diagram").  </s>
<s> Correct me if I misunderstand, it seems HP's WS-Conversation-Language is taking this approach.  </s>
<s> But I also hear that "public process" can be described as a subset of a "private process".  </s>
<s> If you take out the "process variable", "assign statements", and the "conditions" in the switch blocks and loops ... etc from the "private process", then you will have the "public process".  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> other words, public process can be just use the same model of "private process".  </s>
<s> It seems WSCI and BPEL-private process is taking this approach.  </s>
<s> I also heard that the "flow-chart" is equivalent to "state diagram".  </s>
<s> They are just a dual-representation to each other.  </s>
<s> Any comments and thoughts ... ?  </s>

<s> In other words, if the buyer and supplier agree that an order is  $500 as can be calculated from the message (if the schema was known) the buyer can reject the message and the supplier will accept a reject message.  </s>
<s> But if the supplier has determined that the buyer does not have sufficient credit to purchase the product, the supplier proceed to accept the order since the buyer may have a different opinion on the matter ("what do you mean rejected?  </s>
<s> you know I'm good for it!  </s>
<s> I might not have money right now, but I promise to pay you back!").  </s>
<s> I think Jean-Jaques' point actually makes more sense than this: On one hand, there may be pre-negociated conditions to any business transaction that you'd like to be able to model (such as your ceiling for purchase orders).  </s>
<s> I believe this is the stuff that Jean-Jacques was describing with respect to ebBPSS.  </s>
<s> This doesn't make sense in the perspective of a language like BPML, because BPML is focused on the description of process implementation, and doesn't include any kind of formal notion of collaborating trading partners.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, any party in a business transaction could unilaterally reject a message for reasons it may or may not chose to make public.  </s>
<s> As someone else already mentioned, forcing me to expose my credit rating criteria just so our mutual choreography feels more "complete" (for some value of that word) doesn't make a ton of sense.  </s>
<s> I'd rather just say "I might reject you with the following reason", and leave my implementation logic opaque.  </s>
<s> In the case of ebBPSS, I would agree to always return an "order response document", but sometimes the response might be "no".  </s>
<s> I look at it as a question of where we want to "spend" the formalism of our definition.  </s>
<s> Maybe it makes sense to pack error detection logic for all parties into the definition of a choreography (i.e. "after receiving PurchaseOrder, Seller will map out Buyer's DUNS number and invoke web service ValidateCredit, which will in turn contact CreditAgency ...").  </s>
<s> But then we're talking about a language for specifying both (a) how Buyer and Seller communicate and (b) what Seller does with Buyers' communcation.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that a little more parsimony is in order.  </s>

<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> This discussion is actually in the scope of WSCI.  </s>
<s> I definitely agree.  </s>
<s> But I think there are two use cases here.  </s>
<s> In one use case you would return a response, always the same message type but with different values (yes/no).  </s>
<s> The decision is definitely opaque, since the choreography doesn not ask you to describe how the value has been determined.  </s>
<s> You arrive at a value, put it in a message, send that message back.  </s>
<s> In other words: sufficient that you can put some value in the message without describing how you arrived at that value.  </s>
<s> In the other use case you would decide to either return message 'no' or message 'yes', which I believe is the use case JJ is talking about.  </s>
<s> In this case you would want to say two things: 1.  </s>
<s> I either send you message 'no' or message 'yes', but don't expect both 2. I inform you that I will decide whether to send 'no' or send 'yes' but not inform you how I reach that decision What you need is a construct to do 1, which we already have.  </s>
<s> The question for 2 is, do you name the decision?  </s>
<s> One can argue that there is no obvious need to name a decision.  </s>
<s> Another could argue that by naming the decision it could be interpreted as actually telling you what the decision is, which makes the choreography expose too much implementation details.  </s>
<s> The point I am making is that naming the decision does not necessarily expose any implementation value.  </s>
<s> If I call my decision X, can you say how I reach it?  </s>
<s> On the other hand, naming the decision allows me to say things about it that are specific to my implementation.  </s>
<s> For example, there could be 10,000 suppliers out there that reach a decision whether or not to approve a purchase order.  </s>
<s> All participate in the same choreography and any implementation works.  </s>
<s> Some of these suppliers inform you that in their decision X they will take credit information (and any other information they deem suitable) to reach a decision.  </s>
<s> Some suppliers inform you that in their decision X they do not take credit information into consideration.  </s>
<s> None of that information is contained in the choregraphy.  </s>
<s> There is one choreography used by all 10,000 suppliers.  </s>
<s> In other words, you can talk to any of these suppliers using the same choreography.  </s>
<s> But you can favor those that do not look at credit information.  </s>
<s> When you apply for a credit all credit cards have the same sequence of operations (receive application, review application, make decision, if positive open account, send credit card).  </s>
<s> One choreography.  </s>
<s> But some credit card companies would like you to know that their decision differs from the other.  </s>
<s> If you have very little credit you probably would not send an application to a credit company that informs you their decision is based on very rigid rules, but instead send the application to the credit company that advertises "no credit, no problem".  </s>
<s> The APR will be nasty and the balance low, but at least you'll get a credit card!  </s>
<s> So there's some value in both having an opaque decision there (which we all agree about) and being able to reference it from outside the choreography (which I'm not sure we all agree on that).  </s>
<s> Simply being able to name a condition gives you both.  </s>
<s> I definitely agree!  </s>
<s> I would not propose that the choreography language go that far, and besides it would not allow a range of implementation to exist since it will force them all to do the exact same thing.  </s>
<s> But I think there's some misunderstanding there.  </s>
<s> My proposal is not to describe in the choreography how you arrive at a value, only to give it a name.  </s>
<s> If you then decide to reference that name and provide additional information to some interested parties in a manner that does not change the choreography but gives them more visibility into it, that could only be helpful.  </s>
<s> But in no way would that change the choreography, or force you to have different choreography because different implementations arrive at the named values in different ways!  </s>
<s> Is naming values something reasonable that we believe fits in the scope of a choreography language?  </s>
