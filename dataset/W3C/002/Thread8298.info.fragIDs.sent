Hi, first of all I want to thank Julian for his great work on the webdav protocols. 
His page is *the* resource regarding WebDAV for many developers working on the apache Slide project. 
Now I want to decrease my popularity and ask for forgiveness in advance by making the following proposal: 
I'd like to add transaction support to the locking spec as described in I know that this is thew wrong place for long term transactions as 
everyone would prefer a method called TRANSACTION or something similar, but as IIS and Exchange are using the LOCK method to implement transactions, I'd like to see it in the locking spec. 
Maybe it would be an idea to have some basic locking features (current locking spec) and advanced locking (transactions)? 
My personal goal is to achieve full Exchange/IIS compatibility 
regarding WebDAV in the distant future with the Slide project. 
We are currently working on a full JCA implementation working with Slide and hopefully with IIS/Exchange. 
As this is open source, everyone could use this Connector lateron, if transactions are support in the "locking" way. 
We have already implemented full exchange compliant notifications, but this is a different story... Regards, Daniel 
Daniel points out one of the important reasons for not putting transaction support in the locking spec, i.e., transactions are semantically very different from locks. 
The fact that IIS/Exchange chose to syntactically overload the LOCK method with transaction support does not provide a compelling reason to bundle them into a single spec (even if we do eventually decide to standardize on that syntactic overload). 
Another reason for not putting transaction support into the locking spec is that the maturity of those two proposals is very different: the locking spec is clarifying/updating existing standard behavior, while transactions would introduce new WebDAV semantics/behavior. 
The way IIS/Exchange defines/supports transactions will certainly be an important factor in any WebDAV transaction support, but will not be an overriding factor. 
So I encourage you to try to organize a design team for standardizing WebDAV transaction support, but I'm against extending the domain of the locking spec to include transaction support.

Another model for transactions would be something like the COMPOUND method in NFSv4. 
I thought MSFT also implemented batching versions of some other WebDAV methods, and that could address both requirements in a way that has already been approved by the IETF. 
I reading about the support for transactions at the URL included above, I also saw that MS has introduced 'WebDAV notifications' as well. 
The new methods they have developed to support this are SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and POLL, and describe each as being a 'WebDAV method'. 
Note further that MS has also defined batch versions of COPY, MOVE, DELETE, PROPFIND and PROPPATCH: BCOPY, BMOVE, BDELETE, BPROPFIND and BPROPPATCH. 
I'm of the opinion that these methods aren't and should not be described as 'WebDAV methods', for the obvious reason that they have not been developed by the IETF WebDAV working group. 
Unfortunately, I'm not sure what can be done about it either.
