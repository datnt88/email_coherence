The Call for Implementaion Period for Canonical XML closed on November 24th. 
An InformationalRFC as well as a new Candidate Rec (for consideration for Proposed Rec) is being prepared. 
Changes made include those resulting from comments [1,2,3], no change was made with respect to [4]. 
However, in order to successfully advance it to Proposed Rec, it'd be good 
in we could fill in some of the gaps in the interop-report [5]. 
(Petteri and 
Merlin, can you report on the list the status of your implementations with respect to these questions about the parsers treatment of encoding and 
relative URIs?)

Hi, It is probably valid to fill in Y1 down the table for Baltimore. 
We are somewhat processor agnostic, however the conformance tests that we provide do verify all listed requirements of the processor in use.

Ok, now reflected in:
