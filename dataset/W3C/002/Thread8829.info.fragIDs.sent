<s> Cool! I relally like this idea and I am "stealing" it: I hope this will help to improve interoperability accross different implementations.  </s>
<s> A simple Perl script or plain telnet session to port 80 could be used to submit a signed XML Document to the server for verification.  </s>
<s> The verifier pre-loads HMAC key "secret" and Merlin's root CA used in the Merlin's interop test suites.  </s>
