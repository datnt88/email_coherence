<s> At the f2f one of the postponed issues that I wished to advocate reopening was: In particular, given the amount of change we have made I think a small change to rectify the bnode serialization problem should be considered.  </s>
<s> However we were out of time, and so I have decided to raise this by e-mail.  </s>
<s> This is primarily motivated for me by Jena development.  </s>
<s> Within Jena we have repeated user requirement to enable round-tripping.  </s>
<s> e.g. one of our summer students yesterday said words like: "we use N-triple as our transport becuase bNodes are important."  </s>
<s> Since we are not proposing N-triple as a standard, we do have some obligation to make RDF/XML useable.  </s>
<s> I propose that we should modify the RDF/XML syntax to permit bNode labels "_:foo" wherever we currently permit URI refs.  </s>
<s> This still leaves non-standard property names as non-serializable, but that is much less of a problem in practice.  </s>

<s> More detail: Modify: 5.23 Production URI-reference  </s>
<s> An attribute ?string-value? interpreted as a URI reference defined in Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [URIS] BNF production URI-reference.  </s>
<s> uses of URI-reference should have the name changed to resource-reference and then Production resource-reference URI-reference|bNode-reference Production URI-reference  </s>
<s> as before Production bNode-reference An attribute ?string-value? matching "_: NCName ". (where NCName is the production from XML Namespaces).  </s>
<s> The string value gives a bNode identifier with file scope as for NTriple.  </s>
<s> by using two productions (the current URI reference  </s>
<s> If we go this route, I propose we use UUIDs to ensure against accidental collisions between systems or sessions.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> No! That would make people think they're just some kind of globally unique URI thing.  </s>
<s> The more inter-file collision between these, the better, I think.  </s>

<s> I don't believe we have made any changes in advance of implementation experience.  </s>
<s> And I hope we don't.  </s>
<s> I'm against re-opening this issue, as I haven't seen any working code and tests, let alone any that represent designs I like.  </s>

<s> Would that be extendable to allow nodeIDs on literal nodes, also, to handle untidy literals?  </s>

<s> Seems so to me.  </s>
<s> One could simply view untidy literal nodes as analogous to bnodes with literal labels.  </s>
<s> Each denotes a (potentially) different resource and the literal label provides a contextual name for that resource, but since the literal label does not have globally constent meaning (as does a URIref) the denotation is underspecified without that context.  </s>
<s> As with a bnode, you know it denotes "something", but you don't necessarily know exactly what that is, insofar as some global name (URIref) is concerned.  </s>
<s> So, _:foo is a bnode and _:bar"1234" is a literal node.  </s>
<s> Both are "untidy" and the nodeID simply disappears in the graph representation, leaving only the literal string in the case of the literal node.  </s>
<s> _:foo - "", _:bar"1234" - "1234".  </s>
<s> Eh? Patrick  </s>
