<s> rfc2518 8.3.1 talks about MKCOL and says... MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> If the resource identified by the Request-URI is non-null then the MKCOL MUST fail.  </s>
<s> During MKCOL processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI a member of its parent collection, unless the Request-URI is "/".  </s>
<s> If no such ancestor exists, the method MUST fail.  </s>
<s> When the MKCOL operation creates a new collection resource,  </s>
<s> all ancestors MUST already exist, or the method MUST fail with a 409 (Conflict) status code.  </s>
<s> For example, if a request to create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/ exists, the request must fail.  </s>
<s> That last sentence (For example...) strikes me as wrong.  </s>
<s> It seems to suggest that if one of these existed, then you might not need to fail the request.  </s>
<s> Buf if the existance of one of these allows the request to be accepted, then why doesn't the existance of /a/ or / do the same.  </s>
<s> And if it does, doesn't that make the original statement wrong since if /a/ existed, then apparently /a/b/ and /a/b/c/ wouldn't need to exist.  </s>
<s> Anyway, something needs to change here.  </s>
<s> I don't know the intent well enough to know what that something is.  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> The sentence is correct, but confusing.  </s>
<s> (I think I had to go back over it the first time I read it, too.) I agree that's that what it seems to suggest, but it doesn't actually mean that.  </s>
<s> It's just giving one scenario where the request must fail; it doesn't say anything about when it should succeed.  </s>
<s> It might be best to simplify the example, changing "and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/ exists" to "and /a/b/c/ does not exist".  </s>

<s> -- John Kirch |  </s>
<s> The wording was bad.  </s>
<s> It should have said "For example, if a request to create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and either /a/b/ or /a/b/c/ doesn't exist, the request must fail."  </s>
<s> Jim, have we added this to the draft issues list?  </s>
