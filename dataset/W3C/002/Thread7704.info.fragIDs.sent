rfc2518 8.3.1 talks about MKCOL and says... MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by the Request-URI. 
If the resource identified by the Request-URI is non-null then the MKCOL MUST fail. 
During MKCOL processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI a member of its parent collection, unless the Request-URI is "/". 
If no such ancestor exists, the method MUST fail. 
When the MKCOL operation creates a new collection resource, 
all ancestors MUST already exist, or the method MUST fail with a 409 (Conflict) status code. 
For example, if a request to create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/ exists, the request must fail. 
That last sentence (For example...) strikes me as wrong. 
It seems to suggest that if one of these existed, then you might not need to fail the request. 
Buf if the existance of one of these allows the request to be accepted, then why doesn't the existance of /a/ or / do the same. 
And if it does, doesn't that make the original statement wrong since if /a/ existed, then apparently /a/b/ and /a/b/c/ wouldn't need to exist. 
Anyway, something needs to change here. 
I don't know the intent well enough to know what that something is.

The sentence is correct, but confusing. 
(I think I had to go back over it the first time I read it, too.) I agree that's that what it seems to suggest, but it doesn't actually mean that. 
It's just giving one scenario where the request must fail; it doesn't say anything about when it should succeed. 
It might be best to simplify the example, changing "and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/ exists" to "and /a/b/c/ does not exist".

The wording was bad. 
It should have said "For example, if a request to create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and either /a/b/ or /a/b/c/ doesn't exist, the request must fail." 
Jim, have we added this to the draft issues list?
