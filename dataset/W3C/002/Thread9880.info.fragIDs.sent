<s> Some small changes this time: - noted item 7 seems to duplicate 5/6 (not 4/5) - added a little more explanatory text in the section on idioms - presented all idioms using triples  </s>
<s> - re-labelled the idioms A, B, C and D to reduce confusion about their being specific to proposals (but still acknowledging their origin in proposals).  </s>

<s> My apologies if I appeared a bit difficult on this point.  </s>
<s> My concern is simply that we need to distill the desiderda down into trully fundamental expectations/requirements for the solution, with as little (ideally no) forshadowing of any particular proposal or approach -- otherwise we get into a tail wagging the dog situation -- and it seemed to me that the idioms described (all of them) need some degree of contextual understanding that is beyond the scope of this document to provide.  </s>
<s> I am satisfied, however, if the idioms simply reflect current usage, with the relevant pointers (DAML+OIL, CC/PP, whatever), such that if anyone is not clear on the meaning of the idioms,  </s>
<s> they can refer to those references -- not to any of the proposals.  </s>
<s> And in case I failed to say it earlier, thanks Graham for  </s>

<s> Use of XML-schema datatypes", you talk about derived types.  </s>
<s> I think derived types are out of scope.  </s>
<s> In order to specify how a type is restricted, special vocabulary would be required, and this is explicitly off our charter...  </s>
<s> I also think that (1) somehow goes together with (9).  </s>
<s> In your examples, Idiom B seems notationally equivalent to Idiom C. Of course, the difference is in what exB:date and exC:date represent.  </s>
<s> BTW, I added the third idiom as Idiom P to the datatyping document (Idiom D in yours).  </s>
<s> I don't mind renaming it to something else...  </s>

<s> Er... I think the intent was to be able to *use* them, not to specify them.  </s>
<s> Personally, I'd prefer to start with the primitive types and then move on to derived types, but other views were expressed.  </s>
<s> I think that if we remember these are desiderata, not requirements, it's OK.  </s>
<s> These are points for consideration/evaluation of proposals, not must-haves.  </s>
<s> Yes... (9) addresses an aspect of backward compatibility.  </s>
<s> My intituion for now is to keep them as separate items, so that we're reminded to look for other compatibility issues.  </s>
<s> Yes...  </s>
<s> I'm feeling inclined to remove the example and just keep the placeholder with a reference to B.  </s>
<s> That might be confusing .. my idiom 'C' used to be called 'P'.  </s>
