In addition to tidy not reporting some errors [1], I've noted that when tidy changes a file it doesn't touch the time stamp (win2k). 
This means that I 
don't know about the fix, and cvs won't see a change and consequently won't publish the fix.

See the "keep-time" option at: Using, e.g.: tidy -m --keep-time no test.html 
...works as expected under Win2K SP1 using the 4th August 2000 version. 
-- Dave 
See the following option as described on the Tidy page: keep-time: bool 
If set to yes, Tidy won't alter the last modified time for files it writes back to. 
The default is yes. 
This allows you to tidy files without effecting which ones will be uploaded to the Web server when using a tool such as 'SiteCopy'. 
Note that this feature may not work on some platforms. 
I have been able to get this to work, however, I can not get -q or --quiet yes to work (it always gives the W3C ad?). 
Also not that on [1] in the examples the booleans are 'true' but in the text they are 'yes'. 
(Kind of confusing).
