<s> My friend Michael Mealling [mailto:michael@neonym.net] asserts:  </s>
<s> If you have two URIs then you, by definition, have two distinctly  </s>
<s> different Resources.  </s>
<s> The following three URIs are well formed and distinct, but resolve to precisely the same resource: It can be argued that the first and second actually point to a resolution table, which in turn supports redirection of the link to the actual resource (the third), though this seems to me a distinction without a difference, and unhelpful.  </s>
<s> The distinction between the first and the second resides at the DNS level (two domains pointed at the same machine... not all that uncommon).  </s>
<s> Clearly these two are different URLs that resolve to the same resource.  </s>

<s> I asked myself the same thing.....  </s>
<s> If you have two URIs then you, by definition, have two distinctly  </s>
<s> The definition of 'same' that you are using is perfectly reasonable to you but might be completely unreasonable to someone else.  </s>
<s> I personally don't agree with it since I have no real garuantee that oclc.org will remain under OCLC's control since domain-names are re-assignable.  </s>
<s> We spent a large amount of time way back when realizing that 'sameness' with respect to URIs has many 'flavors', only one being universal for all cases in which a URI can be used.  </s>

<s> Weibel,Stu scripsit:  </s>
<s> So you say.  </s>
<s> But how do we know that, absent a clear-cut operational definition of "resource"?  </s>
<s> A resource cannot be identified with the MIME entity body that is returned when you GET it: the resources may be different even though the entity bodies are bit-for-bit identical and have the same media type; contrariwise, a single resource may return different entity bodies on different retrievals.  </s>
<s> So the most you can say is that two URIs always return the same entity bodies (or none at all), which cannot be established empirically because it has to span the entire past and future history of those URIs.  </s>

<s> Quite.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be more precise to say that all three of the above URIs 1. have equivalent denotations (refer to the same resource) 2. resolve to the same set of representations of that resource 3. (potentially) have distinct intensions I see the intersection of the traditional (RESTful) Web and the Semantic Web as being the shared denotations of URIs.  </s>
<s> Both the Web and Semantic Web share the same set of identifiers and a given URI denotes the same resource for both a web agent and a SW agent.  </s>
<s> The Web is concerned with representations of those resources retrievable via their URIs.  </s>
<s> Navigating the Web constitutes traversing from representation to representation via URIs referring to related resources.  </s>
<s> The Semantic Web is concerned with knowledge about resources retrievable in some fashion (e.g. URIQA) via their URIs.  </s>
<s> Navigating the Semantic Web constitutes traversing from description to description via URIs referring to related resources.  </s>
<s> Different URIs may denote the same resource, even if different representations or descriptions are available via those URIs.  </s>
<s> The particular URI chosen often (and usually unknowingly) reflects a distinct intension from other URIs that might denote the same resource, for which we need languages such as RDF and OWL to model effectively.  </s>
<s> While my assertion that http: and https: variants (typically) have identical denotations might be questionable (at least insofar as the letter of the specs), it is certainly the case that the assertion that two different URIs always denote two different resources is not only false, but would render both the Web and Semantic Web unworkably constrained and more seriously, semantically disjoint.  </s>
