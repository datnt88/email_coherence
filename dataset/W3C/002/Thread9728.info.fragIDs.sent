<s> Hello Aaron, dear RDF Core WG, On ietf-types@iana.org and some related list, we were just looking at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/#sec-MediaType which containes some instances of text like this: Same as ... of application/xml as specified in RFC 3023[XML-MT] or the most recent specification that supercedes it.  </s>
<s> There seemed to be general agreement that a moving target is not a good idea.  </s>
<s> Josef Reagle told us that he got that text from: I wanted to tell you that you may want to fix this.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> # Optional parameters: charset # Same as charset parameter of application/xml as # specified in RFC 3023 [XML-MT] or the most recent # specification that supersedes it.  </s>
<s> I admit I was a little confused on this one, and misread what it said.  </s>
<s> However, I don't understand "or the most recent specification that supersedes it", though, since a specification may supercede RFC 3023 but not be appropriate for a reference to a particular section.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to eliminate that text as I oppose those sort of references in general.  </s>
<s> In this case, I was merely following what I could see the rdf folks doing for a similar type of registration:  </s>
<s> I was working on advice from Graham Klyne: If the IETF community is in agreement it should go, then I'll remove it.  </s>

<s> Yes, I can see that moving targets aren't always helpful.  </s>
<s> Question: if the MIME application/xml type specification is updated, and the IANA MIME registry is updated accordingly, which specification is expected to apply?  </s>
<s> Another approach is to not cite the document, but to cite the IANA registry (hence cite the document by indirection)?  </s>
<s> (Which is another way of citing a moving target.)  </s>
<s> I don't know what's best practice here, but having reviewed the specific text again I think that in this case, on balance, it's cleaner to drop the "or the most recent specification ..." words.  </s>
