<s> Hello, as I mentioned earlier (sept) on this list, I'm working with the German W3C office to translate all W3C RECs into the German language.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile we have many translators and I started to change the spec-DTD to fit our needs.  </s>
<s> My goal is to change as little as possible.  </s>
<s> The reason why I'm changing the DTD at all is, that we want to include non-normative annotations.  </s>
<s> Some of you (Eve and Jose) gave me two advices:  </s>
<s> 1) Separate annotations from specs and use XLink to link both together  </s>
<s> 2) Use the 'note' element with an 'role' attribute value of (for example) 'translators-note' My own preference would be choice (1); I would really like to do this.  </s>
<s> Currently I think we can't do this because: a) we want to get results as soon as possible b) we need good tool support for this; there are good DTD-aware editors (unfortunately, although I'd liked it, this is not a research or development project)  </s>
<s> c) we want to import the result in a DTD programm (probably FrameMaker), that only knows about DTDs  </s>
<s> Of course I could write an application, which merges the spec and the annotation together and writes a single XML instance for import in FM.  </s>
<s> But I don't have the time now; maybe in the future.  </s>
<s> I hope that I can later split the specs and annotations that will be written, in order to make a XLink application out of what we're producing now.  </s>
<s> Ok, choice number (2) looks very good to me.  </s>
<s> The first little problem is, that authors would have to write the correct attribute value in the role attribute.  </s>
<s> But I guess, that shouldn't be a serious problem.  </s>
<s> For a while I thought about not changing the DTD, but there's one point that still is a problem: I need a second header element for metadata about a translation.  </s>
<s> In the current version of spec-DTD there's no element to place this kind of information in.  </s>
<s> I decided to change the DTD and to include an element called transheader.  </s>
<s> Since I already changed the DTD I added a second new element called transnote, to get around the minor problem mentioned before.  </s>
<s> Of course I don't need all child elements of 'header' in the new 'transheader'.  </s>
<s> I append my very first version of the trans-spec-DTD below.  </s>
<s> Any answer, comment or improvement is appreciated!  </s>
<s> At the moment I don't like that neither an instance of spec-DTD is an instance of trans-spec nor vice versa.  </s>
<s> I'd like to reach compatibility of some kind.  </s>
<s> The next step will be to change the XSLT-Stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Some of the string constants, such as 'Table of Contents', have to be changed.  </s>
<s> Is there a place in spec-DTD where to note the language in which the text is written?  </s>
<s> I don't think that 'langusage' is the right place, is it?  </s>
<s> What about an attribute to the spec-Element called 'xml:lang'.  </s>
<s> Of course I could add such an element to 'transheader'.  </s>
<s> But in my opinion, transheader xml:lang="de" would mean that the contents of the transheader element is written in German.  </s>
<s> There's nothing said about the contents of the spec element.  </s>
<s> Ok, that are my thoughts for now.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help!  </s>

<s> Hello Stefan,  </s>
<s> For future reference, note that support is being built into Amaya that allows for the creation of third-party annotations using RDF and XPointer.  </s>
<s> The only catch is that you don't have a choice of browsers when creating or viewing the annotations!  </s>
<s> Your customization layer looks fine.  </s>
<s> Compatibility will be a problem until translation markup facilities can be added to XMLspec, of course.  </s>
<s> I'm collecting enhancement requests for V3.0, so your new elements may get added.  </s>
<s> Actually, the language element inside langusage is indeed meant to indicate the language in which the document is written.  </s>
<s> I think this came originally from the TEI DTD.  </s>
<s> These elements have been in the DTD longer than the xml:lang attribute has existed!  </s>
<s> What do people think -- should I add xml:lang to the common attributes, or just to the top-level element, or what?  </s>
<s> Note that the scrap element has a lang attribute that references the ID on a language element from the header.  </s>
<s> (Hmm... While xml:lang is supposed to be able to identify "any natural or formal language", its values are constrained to come from RFC 1766, which is meant for natural languages only.) Should I keep this setup, or dump it?  </s>
<s> If I dump it, what should I do on scrap ?  </s>
<s> My preferences: If I'm going for maximum cleanliness, I would want to remove the langusage structure entirely, put xml:lang in the common attributes, interpret xml:lang at the top level as the language for the entire document unless overridden lower down, and keep scrap lang= but turn it into a CDATA attribute that just contains a formal language name.  </s>
<s> This is backwards incompatible, but could probably be handled in an XSLT conversion script in a reasonable manner.  </s>
<s> (I doubt a lot of people even use langusage or scrap lang= today.) Eve Eve Maler +1 781 442 3190 Sun Microsystems XML Technology Center eve.maler @ east.sun.com  </s>
<s> I hope/expect we can address that presently... the communication between Amaya and the annotation DB is just HTTP, and any browser could support it.  </s>
<s> In particular, I hope we can hook into the "what's related" feature of Netscape (and the analog in IE) to at least list/find annotations, and probably to add them too.  </s>
<s> See also: http://crit.org/  </s>
<s> for a "live within the constraints of current browsers" approach.  </s>
<s> I hope/expect we can share annotation databases between the Amaya-based client and a crit.org-like client.  </s>
