<s> Only Umit and I showed up at today's MEP teleconference.  </s>
<s> Amy and Philippe gave regrets; others were AWOL.  </s>
<s> Umit and I discussed the clarified assumptions in At this point we really need Gudge on the call to ferret out the remaining disagreements/misunderstandings, as others seem to be pretty much in agreement.  </s>
<s> David Booth W3C Fellow / Hewlett-Packard  </s>
<s> It seems obvious, to me at least, that there is quite a gulf between my position and the position other people are taking.  </s>
<s> I think that operations in WSDL should be abstract, defining ONLY the sequence, direction and cardinality of messages.  </s>
<s> All other details that are needed to 'make stuff actually work', like # of channels, sync vs async, timing, are defined at the binding level ( possibly with multiple levels of binding, if we end up supporting multi-level bindings ).  </s>
<s> The thing I find quite bizarre with the current MEP/IOP document is that given the WSDL below, both port types are exactly the same by the time you get to the binding level, but they are not compatible.  </s>
<s> I think this is very bad, because mep2b is essentially a subset of iop2, so it seems very strange that they are modelled as being completely separate.  </s>
