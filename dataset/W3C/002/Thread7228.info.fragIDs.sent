<s> 1.UNCHECKOUT 1.1Problem Definition The term uncheckout actually means two things.  </s>
<s> One definition is that an uncheckout is the removal of a checkout.  </s>
<s> The second definition involves transactioning.  </s>
<s> In this case an  </s>
<s> uncheckout results in all changes the user has made to the resource  </s>
<s> since they checked the resource out, being rolled back.  </s>
<s> 1.2Proposal With my proposed removal of the CHECKOUT method and its replacement with the LOCK method, the first definition is satisfied with the UNLOCK method.  </s>
<s> The second definition requires a transactioning system and as such I believe it is beyond the scope of the DAV draft.  </s>
<s> Those who remember my original position paper on atomic methods will see a contradiction in my view.  </s>
<s> Indeed, my current view does contradict my original statements.  </s>
<s> After having spent the last few days thinking about versioning I have come to the conclusion that the rollback UNCHECKOUT requires a transactioning system and that introducing such a system is completely out of scope for DAV.  </s>
<s> In addition I do not believe that rollback UNCHECKOUT is necessary for a basic interoperable system.  </s>
<s> 2.DAV.VersionSpace  </s>
<s> Link 2.1Problem Definition  </s>
<s> It is highly probable that a single HTTP server will actually be a front  </s>
<s> door to a number of other servers, some will support versioning, some  </s>
<s> will not.  </s>
<s> Some servers will be able to support versioning of a resource  </s>
<s> anywhere in their name space and some will only be able to support  </s>
<s> versioning in specific parts of their name spaces.  </s>
<s> A mechanism is needed  </s>
<s> to determine if a server supports versioning at all and if it does, where.  </s>
<s> 2.2Proposal I propose introducing the DAV.VersionSpace link.  </s>
<s> A DAV versioning compliant system must have this link available from *.  </s>
<s> This link will default to returning a web collection containing a description that indicates which name spaces support versioning and if versioning is automatic or must be requested within those namespaces.  </s>
<s> 3.History 3.1Problem Definition One of the most powerful features of a versioned system is the ability to view the entire history of a versioned resource.  </s>
<s> This information can be built manually by the client by following all the versioning links but this is extremely inefficient.  </s>
<s> Most servers already maintain the history list, as such it would be good for clients to be able to get this list in one request.  </s>
<s> 3.2Proposal I propose that a STRUCTURE method executed on a tree handle return a history.  </s>
<s> This does not remove the need for the DAV.Versioning.History  </s>
<s> link.  </s>
<s> This link is needed to find the tree handle and for proper operation of distributed systems which have no tree handle.  </s>
<s> Your proposal is no different, in terms of race conditions, from mine.  </s>
<s> Between the time you receive the response and the time you send out a request based on that response, the state of the server may have changed.  </s>
<s> In either case, the system deals with recovery.  </s>
<s> The content-nature header provides for requesting exactly what you want and the server is required to refuse the PUT if it can't match the content-nature header.  </s>
<s> So if the situation has changed, the PUT will fail.  </s>
<s> As for your accusation that my proposals do not seem thought out, I personally find facts more compelling then assertions.  </s>
<s> In regards to my "rapid fire approach", there is an author's meeting next week and I wanted to give the author's a chance to see my proposals before I bring them up at the meeting.  </s>
<s> However, rather than just sending the posts to them privately, I decided to share them with the list.  </s>
<s> You  </s>
<s> can not have it both ways Larry.  </s>
<s> Either you have openness with me  </s>
<s> sending the proposals out to the list, or you don't.  </s>
<s> I will eventually be making all the proposals available in a single file, once I have finished them.  </s>
<s> Until then, anyone wanting to refer to them can check the archives of this list.  </s>
<s> All in all your post was offensive and unproductive.  </s>
<s> I hope you will refrain in the future from such postings as it makes it extremely difficult to work with you.  </s>
<s> Your attitude is consistently confrontational rather than cooperative.  </s>
<s> If you have a problem with the content or speed of my postings there are ways to bring the issues forth without being insulting.  </s>

<s> Yaron, I'm just asking for a little consideration and context.  </s>
<s> You were sending a lot of proposals to the mailing list.  </s>
<s> The issues of timing and interaction, robustness and transactions were not addressed or referenced in any of them.  </s>
<s> The problem statements made allusions to previous proposals without giving reference to them, and did not, in the "Problem Statement" section, identify what Distributed Authoring and Versioning problem they solved.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to accept that these are just advanced notice of what you and others will be discussing at a private meeting next week, but it's useful to say that they'll need serious review against robustness criteria, and that the proposals, as written, don't indicate that the review had been done.  </s>
<s> It's OK that they're preliminary drafts.  </s>
<s> I hope it's OK that there's not really a lot of time to review them in depth, and that the analysis of the robustness of the proposals that I gave was pretty hurried.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry that my attempt at humor ("Problem Description" / "Proposal") was taken as insulting.  </s>
<s> I just wanted to say "ouch", what you were doing hurt.  </s>
<s> Regards, Larry  </s>
<s> Your absolutely correct that these are preliminary proposals, that is why I title them as "proposals" and not "text for the standard".  </s>
<s> They are not meant to be bullet proof.  </s>
<s> The proposals have all been generated from a list of open problems I compiled based on comments from the last meeting and Jim's published list.  </s>
<s> I am not trying to provide the final copy of a standard.  </s>
<s> I am trying to show a direction and to see if there is buy off.  </s>
<s> For example, after Jim's letter, I see that people have problems with the STRUCTURE method.  </s>
<s> So I need to flesh that out more in preparation for the author's meeting.  </s>
<s> However, in general, people seem perfectly happy with the new syntax for LINK and LOCK.  </s>
<s> Now I know where to spend more of my time.  </s>
<s> This sort of "gut level" feedback is really useful.  </s>
<s> It helps to create a better spec.  </s>
<s> As for your humor, actually I found that part funny.  </s>
<s> The part I found insulting was your statement, in reference to my proposals, that "It's like they've not really been thought through.".  </s>
<s> I have been working 7 days a week, 14 hours a day, for three weeks in order to make all this content available.  </s>
<s> I will leave it to your imagination as to what it feels like to then have the HTTP-WG Chair come along and label the whole thing as not having been thought out.  </s>
<s> "If you prick me, do I not bleed?  </s>
<s> If you insult my proposals, am I not hurt?" =) Yaron PS If, indeed, they have not been well thought out, then we probably have bigger problems.  </s>
<s> However, as yet, no one has managed to punch any solid holes in them.  </s>
<s> Rather most people, having just first seen these totally new proposals are not fully comfortable with them.  </s>
<s> This is to be expected.  </s>
<s> I have spent weeks wrapping my mind around these ideas.  </s>
<s> It would be unreasonable to expect people, seeing them for the first time and in an abridged form, to instantly accept them.  </s>
<s> It would be like trying to understand Shakespeare from the cliff notes.  </s>
<s> You get a superficial understanding but the richness of the details is missing.  </s>
