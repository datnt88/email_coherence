Dave B's just pointed this out to me (I lost the coin toss so I get to write this :-/ ) In brief: - does anyone out there actually _use_ the last clause of production [6.12] in the grammar? 
Sometimes I wish this feature of RDF would just go away, but Dave always insists on bringing it up. 
;-) My thoughts: test1: OK, if we have to. 
Does anyone feel that this feature is important? 
test2: No, I believe this is inconsistent with our new interpretation of propElt / . 
It should be considered an error, in the same way error1 is. 
test3: Same as test2. 
error1: OK. [ Aaron Swartz | me@aaronsw.com

It would be helpful if you could explain why. 
The grammar production ' ' propName idRefAttr? 
bagIdAttr? 
propAttr* '/ ' allows it and Specifically; each propertyElt start tag containing attribute specifications other than ID, resource, bagID, xml:lang, or any attribute starting with the characters xmlns results in the creation of the triples {p,r1,r2}, ... specifies the interpretation. 
Brian 
The important part comes afterwards: r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new resource. 
If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new resource. 
Since the context of the test cases is the decision that an empty element no longer creates a new resource, I do not feel that RDF should create any 
properties to hang off of that no-longer-existent resource. 
To do so would only make things more confusing.

Can you point me to where that 'context' is discussed/documented. 
I seem to have forgotten. 
Brian 
I apologize in advance if I am mistaken, but I believe we were discussing the test cases in: which states it is about "More on empty property elements" so I assumed it was an addition to the test cases and proposed resolution documented in: which is Jan's message about empty property elements.

Quite so. 
And where is the decision you refer to in: 
discussed and/or documented? 
Brian 
It's documented in the test-cases, specifically test2. 
I didn't mean to 
imply that the working group itself had made these decisions, but that it was these decisions that I thought were under consideration in this discussion.

test2 of Jan's first set of tests states that in a particular case, the object of the statement is a literal, not a resource. 
test2 of Jan's second set of tests is a different case, falls under the rules he refered to in his message and I quoted earlier. 
Those rules require the object of the statement to a resource. 
Not to create a resource in this case would be a change to the spec. 
test2 of Jan's first message says nothing about the interpretation of test2 from his second set of tests. 
They are different cases. 
Would you agree? 
Brian 
Yes, you are correct. 
However, I mentally lumped the issues together, even though they are discussed separately in the spec. 
I withdraw my comments.
