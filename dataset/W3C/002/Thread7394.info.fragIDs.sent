Section 24.4 defines namespaces according to a very old draft of XML namespaces. 
In particular, it still uses a PI for the namespace specification. 
Is there a plan to update that section with respect to the current namespace specification? 
(at demand conformance to this outdated spec (the first paragraph of 24.4.1 requires this conformance). 
Also, the spec does not explicitly discuss the fact that "DAV:" is a valid URI that has been reserved for DAV. 
It implies it when it discusses each element, but it would seem appropriate that if DAV is going to treat the (short) string "DAV:" as a URI, then it should call that out explicitly.

You are correct -- Section 24.4 is currently out of date w.r.t. the current XML Namespaces proposal. 
However, the current XML Namespace proposal is only a W3C Working Draft, and is not yet completely stable. 
While I don't expect there to be massive changes to the XML Namespaces spec. 
between now and its final approval, there will be some changes, and hence I am loathe to update the DAV draft until XML Namespaces are finalized. 
But, it is my recommendation that the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol be updated to reflect the new XML Namespaces draft once it is approved, or near approval. 
Once it is at Proposed Recommendation status, I'll feel comfortable moving forward. 
But, I'm also unwilling to have approval of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol be held up by the XML Namespaces work. 
This raises some issues on how exactly the revision of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring specification will occur. 
There are many possible cases here -- I prefer to wait until the XML Namespaces draft proceeds to Proposed Recommendation before committing to any particular course of action. 
If I were implementing the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol, ideally I would make sure I could understand both types of XML Namespace. 
Section 17, "IANA Considerations" clearly states that we are defining a new URI scheme, and that it has been reserved for use by WebDAV.

I would submit that a massive change has occurred (moving from a PI-based namespace definition to an attribute-based system). 
This kind of disparity can't really be a Good Thing(tm). 
Nevertheless, I do understand the feeling of not wanting to change something that will simply change again. 
However, moving it from about 20% to 90% of "correct" (before final approval of DAV) seems better, if this is a possible option. 
Cool... 
I'm glad that an update will occur at some point. 
I'll just hold out hope/argument for sooner rather than later :-) 
I can understand this. 
Doesn't a revision require a completely new RFC? 
Also, during this revision process, wouldn't the whole thing bog down because people would say, "hey... it's being revised. 
Let's get our pet features in on this round!" ? 
Would it be very disruptive to the current approval process to cut/paste a new section in? 
Or is it a matter of somebody needing to spend time (which is usually non-existent :-) to re-author that section? 
[ I'm not very clueful about the mechanics of the process here and what disruption might occur ] 
"icky" is a good word here. 
:-) 
Ah. I had missed that (sorry). 
Thanks for the pointer.

There are also additional important changes, such as the addition of facilities for defaulting and scoping namespace declarations. 
These might prove themselves quite useful in WebDAV... Dan Daniel.Brickley@bristol.ac.uk Institute for Learning and Research Technology http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/
