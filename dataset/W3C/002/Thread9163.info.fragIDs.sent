<s> I'm adding container support to an RDF parser tonight... it sure is nice to have a pile of test cases to work with.  </s>
<s> But this one looks totally bogus.  </s>
<s> Did we really endorse this one?  </s>
<s> If so, would somebody show me the record?  </s>
<s> why aren't e1 and e4 treated the same way?  </s>
<s> Also... this test involves reification; did we consciously decide how reification works here?  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> test005 sure looks squirrelly too... rdf:li gets special treatment when it's a typednode?  </s>
<s> Ugh... that was evidently on purpose... rdf:li elements will be translated to rdf:_nnn elements when they are found matching either a propertyElt (production 6.12) or a a typedNode (production 6.13).  </s>
<s> I guess my implementation will raise a "not supported" exception in that case; I don't see sufficient value to implement this.  </s>

<s> containers test0004 involves the fourth expansion of the property element production rule 6.12.  </s>
<s> By the decision to drop all the special container rules, this expnasion then  </s>
<s> applies to rdf:li.  </s>
<s> By paragraph 232 (which is so horrible its number!) this  </s>
<s> fourth expansion is different from the others, in that it does not reify, but the ID is the ID of the resource.  </s>
<s> in my opinion para 232 is an error, and is addressed in the unresolved issue  </s>
<s> FFFFFF  </s>
<s> I did some archaelogy on this one, and as far as I could tell, this paragraph dates from the early days before the first working group resolves  </s>
<s> issues 4, 7 ,11 and they still had a certain amount of confusion about referring to a resource and referring to the description of the resource.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> think it is a hard call whether to delete paragraph 232 or preserve it for the sake of backwards compatibility.  </s>
<s> test0005 is also difficult for some parser writers (e.g. me).  </s>
<s> It is fine if  </s>
<s> you really are using an XSLT transform to process rdf:li, but if you're not  </s>
<s> you need some fairly horrid special code for processing a corner case that nobody in their right mind would rely on.  </s>
<s> ARP does it, but I personally am very sympathetic to a not supported exception.  </s>
