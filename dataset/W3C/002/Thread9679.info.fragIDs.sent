Bad girl. 
I'll spank her. 
As I recall, we discussed ensuring the WG could approve comments and get them back in time. 
I have recorded these action as: review charmod in time to get WG comments to charmod by 31st May Brian 
2002-04-19#1: frankm sync up with eric concerning primer 2002-04-19#2: danb review primer, specifically schema stuff 2002-04-19#3: martyn review current primer 
Just for the record: I sent Frank my comments on sections 1-3. 
Still favourable... DanBri, I'll skip section 4 (Schema) in favour of spending my limited time on section 5 etc if you want to concentrate on that.

Well, Ive READ it. 
It looks fine to me (most impressive). 
However I also do not think that my opinion is worth much. 
So: no problems, but no expectation that someone else will find none.

Sorry Pat you jumped too soon. 
The version to review isn't published yet. 
I'll do a more detailed analysis and try and point to changes from the current draft. 
My comments on the current draft would be something like: - string stuff has been helpful - RDF Core is instance of application of [S] part of charmod that may help in move from CR to PR - IRI stuff unhelpful, because of lack of consensus around IRI draft - Exit criteria for CR need to include sufficiently numerous normalizing transcoders. 
(More so than usual given the wide applicability of the requirement). 
I will write something fuller when I have seen the last call WD. Jeremy
