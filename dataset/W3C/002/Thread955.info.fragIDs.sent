Hi, after following a bunch of links, I was able to download the October 2003 version of Tidy HTML. 
Now what?! I tried to open it to check my HTML in my Documents, but no program that I choose will open it. 
I have Windows ME on a Dell laptop computer. 
Thanks for any help!

What is the name of this file and where did you get it from? 
In a message dated 10/16/2003 7:04:39 AM Eastern Daylight Time, I don't remember the name of the file, and I got it from the sourceforge web site. 
I remember now that it said it was a "source code," so maybe what I downloaded wasn't Tidy HTML, but I remember that was part of the name. 
This is so confusing that I think that I'll deal with it all another time. 
I was even 
getting errors for the sitemeter on my site, which I want to keep. 
So I doubt I'll be able to have an HTML 4.01 Transitional web site. 
I also wanted to keep the sitemeter "hidden," so I used a lot of .br 
tags to put it way down at the bottom. 
But thanks for asking.

In which case you need to compile it in order to produce the executable version. 
If you aren't into compiling software, then you should instead download the ready-made executable from tidy.int64.org 
(a pointer to this is on the Sourceforge page: the first thing listed under "Other builds" near the bottom of the page). 
You want the one called "tidy- exe.zip" and you'll need an unzip utility to extract the files.
