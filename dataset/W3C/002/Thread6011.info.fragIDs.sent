<s> Privacy *is* going to be addressed by the WSA.  </s>
<s> It is not currently had a huge amount of progress since this was posted at the beginning the May.  </s>

<s> Frank, In looking at this privacy draft, I have a few comments and/or questions: * Does this not define a potential dependency for choreography - for privacy and identity (such as federated network identity, and work in other sections like Liberty)?  </s>
<s> * If so, is it within our scope to expand on this and/or provide input to WSA? * This may also involve quality of service.  </s>
<s> Has this been considered?  </s>
<s> * Other mechanisms exist beside WS-Policy such as WS-PolicyLanguage which is already within a standards body (OASIS, XACML I believe).  </s>
<s> Perhaps as we continue these discussions, we can early on identify what is within our scope or findings we need to pass to other groups/entities.  </s>

<s> My initial take was that it was out of scope.  </s>
<s> Maintainence of privacy policies and preferences is especially important when interacting with a service or a choreography that forwards requests to other services, which may not be visible (a facade or composition pattern).  </s>
<s> There are proposals that address this.  </s>
<s> For example, the combination of SAML + XACML can convey security and access information across multiple web service interactions.  </s>
<s> IBM &amp; Microsoft have also outlined a proposed WS-Privacy spec, which I don't think has been published yet.  </s>
<s> IMO the mechanisms for this are below the choreography level but we may want to include a note indicating that such technologies exist, or are emerging, and that there are cases where they are needed to meet privacy requirements.  </s>
<s> I think the previous discussion of privacy in the list has more to do with hiding information about interactions themselves (not necessarily the data content of interactions), which is a different set of issues.  </s>
<s> --Jon  </s>
<s> A couple of points here.  </s>
<s> 1) Yes, Privacy use cases and requirements have been addressed as part of WSA Requirements.  </s>
<s> If there are special privacy requirements that need to be addressed for choreographed message exchanges then we should coordinate that with WSA.  </s>
<s> Francis discussion w.r.t. privacy context is interesting and extends the privacy discussions currently captured in WSA. 2) Federated identity management certainly intersects with Liberty as well other WS Security specifications.  </s>
<s> E.g., OASIS WSS, recently made public WS-Federation spec from Microsoft and IBM. 3) Eventually, I see that WS-I will have to take up the work to develop interoperability profiles for securing choreographed message exchanges although in the short-run the expectation is that they will produce some basic security profiles for transport and message level security using SSL/TLS and OASIS WSS.  </s>
