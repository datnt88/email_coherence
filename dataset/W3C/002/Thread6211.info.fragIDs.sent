Sandra, Here are some of the updates for the IBM 1.1 test contributions. 
Can you update these in CVS and I'll work on the remaining issues. 
Appologies for the problems. 
The tests were written a while back, things changed, comments were not updated properly, etc. Anyways here are some comments. 
(1) ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml 
The UTF-8 code for LSEP (2028) in this file seems to be wrong. 
I believe it should be e2 80 a8, the file has e0 9f ac which is a non-shortest UTF-8 sequence for something else. 
[GM] Agree, a typo, the byte sequence corresponds to the character #x7EC and 
should be changed to e2 80 a8, but its still a valid document. 
(2)ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v04.xml &amp; (3)ibm-valid-P03-ibm03v08.xml [GM] Tests that were originally added for clarifications (are NEL &amp; LESP in S) and are no longer valid. 
Updated tests are attached above. 
(4) ibm-valid-P04-ibm04v01.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v01.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v02.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v03.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v05.xml 
These contain names that use colons in ways not allowed by namespaces, so they need NAMESPACE="no" in the config file. 
(5) ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v05.xml [GM] Agree, the config file will have to be modified as suggested. 
We treat these as namespaces="no" in our suite though. 
(6) ibm-valid-P03-ibm03v*.xml 
[GM] Agree. 
(7) ibm-valid-P46-ibm46i01.xml, ibm-valid-P46-ibm46i02.xml [GM] Similar to (2) (3), agree the comment now needs to be changed. 
(8) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n09.xml [GM]Agree, updated test attached. 
(9) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n0??.xml [GM] Agree, the file names mentioned above need to be fixed in the configuration file. 
(10) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n10.xml This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x100". 
But 100 is not a control character, and in fact the file contains a non-shortest UTF-8 sequence. 
[GM] Attached a modified test case, the comment in the config file will have to be updated. 
(11) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n13.xml This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x0D" which would be legal, but in fact contains control-A. 
(Mabe all the tests corresponding to legal control characters have been messed up?) [GM] Attached a modified test case, the comment in the config file will have to be updated. 
(12) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n38.xml This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x86" but in fact contains 82. 
Probably this is because it's between 84 and a real 86, and 85 is NEL. [GM] This test contains a embeded control characters x82, x83 and x84. 
The comment in the configuration file needs to be updated. 
(13) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n58.xml This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x99" but in fact contains a non-shortest UTF-8 sequence. 
[GM] Attached updated test (15) ibm-not-wf-P04-ibm04n2[1-4].xml ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an2[1-4].xml 
These are supposed to have bogus surrogates, but instead have question marks. 
[GM] Agree, the characters somehow got messed up. 
I have attached fixed tests. 
(16) ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an0[1-3].xml, ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an1[1-2].xml 
These don't have the characters they are claimed to, probably a UTF-8 screwup. 
[GM] Agree, Incorrect comments, they should have been ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an0[1-3].xml - #xB8, #0xA1 and #0xAF ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an1[1-2].xml - #0x203D and #0x2041 (17) ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an17.xml, ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an18.xml Test for 2edc and 2fed which are in fact legal. 
[GM] Agree, Incorrect comments, they should have been #x2BDC and #x2A30 (18) ibm-not-wf-P05-ibm05n02.xml Purports to test for illegal name char 300, but actually has 3000 which is also illegal. 
[GM] Agree, test case with illegal name char x300 attached. 
(19) ibm-not-wf-P77-ibm77n13.xml This doesn't test what it claims to; it is not-wf because the document entity is 1.0 and an external entity is 1.1. 
[GM] Agree, the comment needs to be corrected. 
That's all for now. 
Thanks, 
Glenn 
It's not the shortest sequence for 7EC, so it's a UTF-8 error and therefore not well-formed. 
-- Richard 
Ok!! I will work on these ones. 
I Will let you know if I have questions.

What is the final agreement on this one?

I am no expert on Unicode, but have sometimes the need to understand it. 
According to table 3.1B of Unicode 3.2, the sequence e0 9f ac is not a valid UTF-8 sequence. 
That much I understand. 
At this point I was assuming 
that this table allows one to check valid/shortest sequences. 
Now, this confuses me. 
The UTF-8 table allows this sequence, but it cannot map to 7EC, but must map to somewhere in the range 1000 to CFFF. 
So, is it now a sequence for 7EC, and if yes, where am I wrong? 
Karl 
I think we're agreed to change it to e2 80 a8, the only question is whether the old, mistaken value is legal or not, and we don't have to decide that. 
-- Richard 
Right. 
But if you don't check that it's legal, and follow the natural algorithm for decoding it, you will get 7EC. 
Some implementations just apply the algorithm blindly without checking. 
There were two mistakes: the code point used was 2028 decimal (= 7EC hex) instead of 2028 hex. 
And 2028 decimal was encoded as a 3-byte sequence instead of a 2-byte sequence. 
-- Richard 
Thanks, that clears it up for me.

Sandra, The updated configuration files are attached. 
Looks like they were being updated in CVS after we started pulling all this together, but attaching them anyways for completeness. 
(14) Tests invalid NameStartChars x2b00 and 2bff (16) Updated comment in the test case. 
(17) Tests invalid NameChars xFDD0 and xFDEF Regards, 
Glenn 
I have completed all the updates. 
CVS is ready to be checked. 
Glenn I still 
need an update for ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml Sandra

Glenn I still need an update for ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml 
Sorry, I had it in an earlier note that I missed sending along to you. 
Attached is test ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml -Glenn 
Thank you!! but notice the name of the test, ibm02v01 --- the one you sent me is the correct test but incorrect name (ibm02v011) I will save it under the right test name.
