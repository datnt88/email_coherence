<s> Hi, A great many thanks for making tidy ;-)  </s>
<s> My little question is why it (seemingly) is not possible to capture the output of tidy in a pager program.  </s>
<s> If I do tidy -e foo.html | most it is as if the output stream is terminated just before the pager program is launched leaving it with an emty buffer?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Morten "Counting in octal is just like counting in decimal - if you don't use your thumbs." (Tom Lehrer)  </s>
<s> Don't the errors come out on stderr?  </s>
<s> So, tidy -e foo.html |&amp; most to get everything paged.  </s>
<s> This limitation is documented in the "Overview.html"  </s>
<s> document (that used to be the home page for the original Tidy project) provided with older versions of Tidy (and is still available from the main Tidy web page) : Tidy writes errors to stderr, and won't be paused by the more command.  </s>
<s> A work around is to redirect stderr to stdout as follows.  </s>
<s> This works on Unix and Windows NT, but not on other platforms.  </s>
<s> My thanks to Markus Wolf for this tip!  </s>
<s> tidy file.html 2 &amp;1 | more Hope this helps.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> Hi, Thanks to those who replied.  </s>
<s> To those of you using Lynx I now have this little tip on validating pages "on the fly" I'd like to share.  </s>
<s> If you place these lines in your lynx.cfg EXTERNAL:http:lynx -source %s | tidy -e 2 &amp;1 | most:TRUE EXTERNAL:file:lynx -source %s | tidy -e 2 &amp;1 | most:TRUE you can then validate the current page by pressing "," or validate a page pointed to by a link by pressing "." This requires Lynx to be compiled with the ./configure  </s>
<s> option --enable-externs.  </s>
<s> I think that's the default on most precompiled packages.  </s>
<s> "most" is my pager program of preference.  </s>
<s> Change it to more/less or whatever suits you.  </s>
<s> I have the line below in lynx.cfg to feed the validation output to my mail program with the purpose of documenting html problems to the webmaster of the site in cases where the problems are so grave that they impede navigation.  </s>
<s> EXTERNAL:http:lynx -source %s | tidy -e  /tmp/tidy.tmp  </s>
<s> ; mutt -s "HTML problems at you site" -i /tmp/tidy.tmp  </s>
<s> Even if it only helps writing webmasters once in a blue moon one should still do it, I think ;) Regards, Morten PS: I am not on the list so please cc me if you have any comments.  </s>
