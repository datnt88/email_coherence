<s> Hi Joseph, Regarding the here() function, the XPointer WG some time ago agreed to having essentially the same definition as ours, and their last call working draft reflects this decision.  </s>
<s> So, I'd say it is safe to take out the 'Note' in our document, though hopefully this feature will not change after last call-- as was the case with entity markers in InfoSet.  </s>

<s> We didn't have any feedback on either, so I expect we should leave them as is.  </s>

<s> Hi Donald, What guidelines are used to measure significance?  </s>
<s> Current interop examples exercise KeyValue and X509Data, but none of the other key info types.  </s>
<s> Is that important?  </s>
<s> It seems  </s>
<s> that RetrievalMethod is possibly the most complex of them; does it rise above insignificance?  </s>
<s> On the m5l C14N front, the algorithm seems relatively unpopular with current implementers.  </s>
<s> I know that we will not be implementing it in the near future, so will not be able to participate in any necessary interop.  </s>
