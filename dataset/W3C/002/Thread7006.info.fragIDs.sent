Hi, I have a question regarding the examples in Appendix C.2 of RFC2396. 
It says: 
Similarly, parsers must avoid treating "." and ".." as special when they are not complete components of a relative path. 
/./g = http://a/./g 
My question regards this first example. 
My implementation is resolving this 
relative URI (with http://a/b/c/d;p?q as the base URI) as http://a/g. 
Every 
other example in Appendix C is passing for me. 
I must have a bug but I'm confused as to why the dot in the above example isn't "complete component of a relative path" that should get stripped. 
Can anybody enlighten me? 
Thanks, Jason. 
/./g isn't a relative path--it starts with /.

Thanks. 
I missed the text in Step 5 of Section 5.2 that says 
5) If the path component begins with a slash character ("/"), then the reference is an absolute-path and we skip to step 7. 
I was trying to normalize the path regardless of whether the original URI reference was relative or not. 
Thanks, Jason.
