<s> Hi, I have a question regarding the examples in Appendix C.2 of RFC2396.  </s>
<s> It says:  </s>
<s> Similarly, parsers must avoid treating "." and ".." as special when they are not complete components of a relative path.  </s>
<s> /./g = http://a/./g  </s>
<s> My question regards this first example.  </s>
<s> My implementation is resolving this  </s>
<s> relative URI (with http://a/b/c/d;p?q as the base URI) as http://a/g.  </s>
<s> Every  </s>
<s> other example in Appendix C is passing for me.  </s>
<s> I must have a bug but I'm confused as to why the dot in the above example isn't "complete component of a relative path" that should get stripped.  </s>
<s> Can anybody enlighten me?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason.  </s>
<s> /./g isn't a relative path--it starts with /.  </s>
<s> paul  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I missed the text in Step 5 of Section 5.2 that says  </s>
<s> 5) If the path component begins with a slash character ("/"), then the reference is an absolute-path and we skip to step 7.  </s>
<s> I was trying to normalize the path regardless of whether the original URI reference was relative or not.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason.  </s>
