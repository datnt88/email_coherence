Dear W3C, I was wondering if you were aware fo the emerging standard scheme for accesskeys? 
It has been suggested by the UK government, and in the absence of any alternative scheme, this has rapidly become a worldwide standard, adopted by council, military, healthcare and academic.sites 
in the UK, as well as government sites in Australia, educational sites in the USA and Africa, and more recently, commercial sites in Canada and on mainland Europe. 
Aside from the clear advantage of inter-site consistency (meaning that people are more likely to know and use the keys because they don't need to relearn a new set for every site), this standard is also for the most part numerical, and so is not affected by alphabetical browser menu conflicts, as well as being compatible with WebTV and mobile phones. 
So to conclude, have the W3C considered implementing these "standard" accesskeys into their website? 
Thanks for your time, Regards, Richard 
Hello, Richard, 
Though I am not completely sure, I believe that the W3C list best suited to this question is the WAI User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group list mailto:w3c-wai-ua@w3.org . 
The list archive has some fairly recent discussion of access keys. 
This is the group's home page:

Dear Susan 
Thanks for your very informative email. 
yes, the discussion does seem quite interesting, with some sort of international consensus being formed. 
However, with regards to the W3's own website, although it has 
introduced some accesskeys (and these are very useful), I have 
noticed that there are one or two that conflict with some common 
browser's keyboard shortcuts: B is used in both Opera and Mozilla for Bookmarks E is used universally for Edit T is used in both IE and Mozilla for Tools I was just wondering if the W3 had considered expanding on their 
use of shortcuts even more (soas to set an example to others), and 
maybe also adopting this numerical scheme? 
Thanks for your time. 
Regards, Richard 
Hello, Richard, 
Thank you for pointing this out. 
I am not aware of a pattern of use on the W3C site and am copying wai-site-comments@w3.org with this mail. 
The Web Accessibility Initiative really are the experts and might know more. 
I suggest that you contact them.

Dear Richard, We are currently redesigning the WAI Web site (a sub-site of the W3C site, w3.org) and we welcome your suggestions. 
(More information about the WAI Web site redesign will be posted to The best place to send feedback relating to the WAI Web site is: wai-site-comments@w3.org 
We are interested to know which accesskeys you use the most, and on which pages.

Dear Shawn, Thanks for yoru email. 
Thanks... On most sites that have them, Alt+1 for home is definately by far the most useful, as it saves having to highlight the URL field and delete the part after the slash. 
Sites that offer shopping or interactive media obviously have different requirements from your own, but the main sections (News/FAQ/Map/Contact/etc) would all do well to have their own accellerator. 
On page-specific forms and links, I suppose it all depends on the specific content. 
Regards, Richard
