<s> td form /td before.... and I'm running into it on a site I need to clean up.  </s>
<s> What I want to do is basically delete the td and /td as it makes no sense.  </s>
<s> How do I do that in tidy?  </s>

<s> PS Before visiting htmlhelp.com,  </s>
<s> I first tried to get the answer from the source (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#edef-TD).  </s>
<s> However, (and maybe it's just me), I just couldn't understand their notation regarding which tags are legal within other tags.  </s>
<s> Could someone explain that, if it's not too complicated?  </s>

<s> It's only valid if the matching /form appears before the /td That is, you can have td ... form ... /form ... /td or ... /td ... /form which is commonly found as a way to get forms to "look right".  </s>
<s> This last, I assume, is what the original requester is trying to clean up.  </s>
<s> It's actually worse than that.  </s>
<s> FORM tags dont even belong (though are tolerated) within a TR block.  </s>
<s> You should actually define it outside the TABLE , except there is vertical whitespace inserted if your /FORM is not inside the table.  </s>
<s> So the common workaround is which is bad form, but it works "ok".  </s>
<s> The snippet of SGML at the URL cited indicates that TD elements can contain zero or more (denoted by the asterisk "occurrence indicator") flow entities.  </s>
<s> A flow entity is defined (click on the link to obtain the definition) as either a block or an inline entity.  </s>
<s> A block entity consists of a number of alternate items, one of which is the form element.  </s>
<s> So a form element may be contained within a TD element.  </s>

<s> TH and TD elements "-" must have a start-tag TD "O" do not need to have an end-tag /TD (but may if you want) "(%flow;)*" have as contents zero or more of the things listed under %flow; Something is allowed in "%flow;" iff it is allowed in "%block;" or ("|") "%inline;" !ENTITY % block "P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | CENTER | NOSCRIPT | NOFRAMES | BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | ISINDEX | HR | TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS" Block elements can be P or ... or ADDRESS.  </s>
<s> One of the options is FORM.  </s>
<s> So a TD may indeed contain a FORM.  </s>
<s> However, while and td form /form are legal, is not, because tells us that a FORM "- -" must have an end-tag as well as a start-tag.  </s>
