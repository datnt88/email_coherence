Hi, 
4.4.4 
The X509Data Element: The commented distinguished names in the example are backwards; in text form they should go from CN to C, as the non-commented distinguished name does. 
Also the intermediate cert says "... issuer ,C=..." which might be better expressed as "...; br issuer C=..." or somesuch.

Now reads: !-- Intermediate cert subject CN=arbolCA,OU=FVTO=IBM,C=US issuer,CN=tootiseCA,OU=FVT,O=Bridgepoint,C=US -- Joseph Reagle Jr. W3C Policy Analyst mailto:reagle@w3.org

The order you give is the correct LDAP order. 
The order currently in the document matches the actual DN in ASN.1 and also the OSF syntax. 
Since we're using LDAP delimiters, we should probably use LDAP order.
