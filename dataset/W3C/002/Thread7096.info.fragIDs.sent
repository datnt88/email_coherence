<s> Topic: About encoding reserved characters in the query part of an URL.  </s>
<s> Hi, I'm dealing with a bug report of BBedit - Barebones Software, which is an HTML editor.  </s>
<s> [1]  </s>
<s> The question is that BBedit has a mechanism to automatically translate the URIs in a document when it's inside an href.  </s>
<s> + For example when you have typed BBedit will convert it to + But if you have typed a  </s>
<s> href="http://www.example.org/foo?http://www.example.net/path/index.html"  </s>
<s> A  </s>
<s> request /a BBedit is complaining with the message: Value of attribute "href" for element " a " is invalid; URL path needs encoding ("/foo?http:  </s>
<s> %2F%2Fwww.example.net%2Fpath%2Findex.html").  </s>
<s> The RFC 2396 [2] says: 3.4.  </s>
<s> Query Component  </s>
<s> The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by the resource.  </s>
<s> query = *uric Within a query component, the characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "&amp;", "=", "+", ",", and "$" are reserved.  </s>

<s> A request /a a href="http://www.example.org/foo?toto=3&amp;tata=4"  </s>
<s> A request /a  </s>
<s> I don't see any difference between the two.  </s>
<s> Is the second meant to have an &amp;amp;?  </s>
<s> of an URL?  </s>
<s> Well the RFC says: If the data for a URI component would conflict with the reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before forming the URI.  </s>
<s> I think that basically, if the URL works works with the server, then you're OK.  </s>

<s> BBedit corrects the HTML representation of the URI, but does not translate the URI itself.  </s>
<s> I tend to disagree, see section 2.2 of RFC 2396: If the data for a URI component would conflict with the reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before forming the URI.  </s>
<s> Let's take some example URIs: [1] http://www.example.org/?foo=bar&amp;baz=&amp;  </s>
<s> [2] http://www.example.org/?foo=bar&amp;baz=%26  </s>
<s> [3] http://www.example.org/?foo=bar;baz=&amp;  </s>
<s> [4] http://www.example.org/?foo=bar;baz=%26  </s>
<s> The query consists of key/value pairs.  </s>
<s> [1] foo = bar | baz =  |  = [2] foo = bar | baz = &amp; | [3] foo = bar | baz = &amp; | [4] foo = bar | baz = &amp; | In [1] the ampersand seperates pairs, it has three pairs.  </s>
<s> In [2] there are only two pairs, the ampersand is now recognized as data, not as separator, in [3] and [4] the semicolon seperates pairs, it does not matter whether the ampersand is escaped or not.  </s>
<s> Your example is a syntactically valid URI, since it matches the production rules of RFC 2396 (and RFC 2616 defining the http: URI scheme).  </s>
<s> The RFC 2396 point is, since [fo] is not in the set of unsafe and reserved characters, but is not equivalent to since '?' is in one of the mentioned sets.  </s>
<s> The matter is IMO ambiguity, using clearly indicates [:/] are data and have no special meaning, while does not, maybe ':' is a separator here or something.  </s>
<s> The latter needs additional interpretation not outlined in RFC 2396 in order to claim equivalence to the former, however, syntactically valid are both URIs.  </s>
