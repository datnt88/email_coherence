<s> Hello, I had a question/comment about Section 3.2.1, Reference Validation.  </s>
<s> The steps listed are to be performed for each Reference element.  </s>
<s> Step 1 says we should canonicalize SignedInfo first.  </s>
<s> Yet, if we do this for every Reference element we are running the canonicalization algorithm N-1 extra times where N is  </s>
<s> the number of Reference elements in SignedInfo .  </s>
<s> Shouldn't one run of C14N be enough to canonicalize the signed info?  </s>
<s> Why do it every time?  </s>
<s> Are we  </s>
<s> expecting the structure of Reference to change as we are validating the signature?  </s>

<s> I think running the canonicalization just once is fine.  </s>
<s> Generally here as in other partrs of the standard, you can use any technique that produces in the same result.  </s>
<s> It should probably be documented as being canonicalized once.  </s>

<s> Yes, that is the intent.  </s>
<s> I've tweaked [1] to express this intent better.  </s>
