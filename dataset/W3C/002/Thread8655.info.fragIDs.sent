<s> Hi all, We must be getting close to completion because it only took an hour to tweak the document this time, including the changes suggested today by Petteri Stenius and TAMURA Kent as well as prior feedback from Jonathan Marsh about removing the serialization as an addition to the function library.  </s>
<s> TAMURA-san: You posted a question about order of namespace nodes.  </s>
<s> The paragraph about serializing the namespace and attribute axes states that the  </s>
<s> primary key for lex order of nodes on these axes is the namespace URI, so I  </s>
<s> don't know what the problem is.  </s>
<s> Do you see a problem with using namespace URI (e.g. are you thinking we need to always add the default definition for  </s>
<s> xmlns to the initial evaluation context)?  </s>
<s> All: Is it an urgent issue that the parsing requirements still specify the need for retaining the namespace prefix from the input document?  </s>
<s> We can actually change the serialization process so that this is not required, but I'd rather not do that if there is wide availability of parsers that retain the original QName of elements, etc. Editors: Please consider this new draft of the XPath transform specification for the candidate recommendation.  </s>
<s> The changes are based on last-call feedback from the WG. Thanks, John Boyer Software Development Manager PureEdge Solutions, Inc. (formerly UWI.Com) Creating Binding E-Commerce jboyer@PureEdge.com  </s>

<s> Hi TAMURA-san,  </s>
<s> In section 5.4 of the XPath spec, the namespace URI for all namespace nodes is declared to be NULL, so the comparison as defined always works (the primary key is always the same).  </s>
<s> Another way to put this is that I intend option A below.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen option B used elsewhere, and I don't think there would be any benefit in deriving one here.  </s>
