<s> All, I've found a little time this week to get moving on RDFS again.  </s>
<s> Not a huge amount of progress to show, but a URL for the current (evolving) copy of the document.  </s>
<s> This document is an internal Working Draft of the World Wide Web Consortium RDF Core Working group.  </s>
<s> This text is undergoing active editorial work and is subject to change; the draft you are looking at is an evolving snapshot for the RDFCore WG to consider.  </s>
<s> TODO items are marked @@TODO; these all need to be addressed before wider circulation.  </s>
<s> Specifically, this text does not yet reflect all of the decisions made during the RDF Core meeting of Aug 1st-2nd.  </s>
<s> The previous internal WD version is now frozen at: document in its first "RDF Core" incarnation.  </s>
<s> The new URL given above will be where the doc will evolve until we have something that starts to look like a release candidate.  </s>
<s> Changes: - have been pretty minimal...  </s>
<s> - Shortened!  </s>
<s> The old, outdated, scope section has been cut; the text may be useful for the forthcoming Primer, and new scoping text, for example anticipating future Web Ontology language work, may need adding.  </s>
<s> - editorial task list added to Status section (diffs / CVS logs available on request, as the changes are folded in) - the XHTML tidied, indented properly (using tidy -m -asxml -indent) - I've begun to extract the RDF examples, for validation and, perhaps, to include in the test suite - the "subProperties inherit conjunctively" decision has been reflected in the text - outdated portions (eg.  </s>
<s> old forward-refs to the XML datatypes work) have been flagged with @@TODO in the text My current attention is on a rewrite / reorganisation of section 3.0 to reflect the new semantics for domain and range, and to improve general readability.  </s>
<s> The text is currently IMHO a mess, and needs a makeover.  </s>
<s> Currently I'm working on folding in the main new change to the spec: the newly meaningful domain/range constraints.  </s>
<s> I don't like the current example (Van/Car/etc) as a way of introducing and explaining domain and range; it doesn't really help.  </s>
<s> So I am thinking an example closer to the domain/range diagram from the old MCF spec, see http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-MCF-XML-970624/#sec2.  </s>
<s> will make for a more readable and understandable spec.  </s>
<s> I'm working on a new version of the domain/range part of the spec with this in mind, will have something out over the weekend for your consideration.  </s>
<s> A related question: the figures in the spec all need updating.  </s>
<s> To date we have been using MS Word Draw, and this is starting to prove a nuisance (not least since I don't run MS Office).  </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend candidate diagram-editing tools that might be useful for our specs?  </s>
<s> Linux, or Windows, either would do.  </s>

<s> Dan  </s>
<s> I reworked appendix A, attached, if this is any help.  </s>
<s> (Just reflects me getting annoyed with the bugs in which happens to be a URL in an ARP test case).  </s>
<s> Changes from appendix a are: 1: delete 2nd para which refers to cycles 2: globally replace " ID" by " rdf:ID"  </s>
<s> about" by " rdf:about" resource" by " rdf:resource"  </s>
<s> 3: add the xml decl with the encoding.  </s>
<s> 4: changed one of the french terms which by poor french suggested was wrong (isDefinedBy estD?finiPar - jjc or esD?finiPar - old) the old appendix A seemed to suggest (without any encoding statement).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately is not legal XML.  </s>
<s> The (omitted) XML declaration says it is in UTF-8, but the French escape sequences are not legal UTF-8.  </s>

<s> I guess I should also point I did some of this: RDFS in RDF/XML (updated) and N-Triples for the schema and examples.  </s>
<s> The N-Triples were generated by my Raptor N-Triples parser, haven't been hand-checked yet.  </s>
<s> CVS: http://cvs.ilrt.org/cvsweb/redland/rdfcore/schema/  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> The rdf-schema.rdfs file needs the XML decl, with As it stands, the file is not XML! (Because it uses the default UTF-8 encoding and sousPropri&amp;#233;t&amp;#233;De is ill-formed UTF-8 - it is iso-8859-1).  </s>

<s> Jeremy Carroll said:  </s>
<s> I did check all the examples with XML parsers (libxml and expat) and my RDF/XML parser (raptor) and they all worked fine but you are correct.  </s>
<s> I guess they must do something clever with checking the encoding.  </s>
<s> Fixed: Dave  </s>
<s> I don't really understand how this sort of RDFS spec fits into our present work.  </s>
<s> Isn't it completely subsumed by sections 4 and 5 of the model theory spec and the primer-to-be?  </s>
<s> Hmm... I guess neither of those is home to rdfs:label nor rdfs:comment.  </s>
<s> nor rdfs:seeAlso rdfs:isDefinedBy (how is it that those are "core properties"?) If we're going to stick to the idea of an editorial revision of RDF 1.0, the RDFS sections of the MT can't go in there.  </s>
<s> But maybe it's not worth doing separate RDF 1.0-second-edition and RDFS-to-REC processes; maybe it's easiest to just do one big set of specs.  </s>
<s> Anyway... I don't think the RDFS spec should maintain its present form.  </s>
<s> I suggest it should be about 3 pages: just give each of the terms in the vocabulary and the rules (ala the MT spec) that define them.  </s>
<s> Leave all the examples and fluffy prose to the primer(s).  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> I don't have a strong opinion about whether the RDFS spec should maintain its present form or not, but I don't think I agree with the idea that the spec should be nothing more than 3 or so pages of terms and rules, with all the explanatory material pushed off into the primer.  </s>
<s> I expect a primer on a language to be be a source of explanatory material on that language, but not to be the *only* source of explanatory material (and I would expect a primer to go about its job of explaining things differently than a specification would in any case).  </s>
<s> There is room for argument about examples being part of a language specification or not (I tend to favor them), but I expect the spec by itself to be a reasonable description of the language for those who are intended to be its likely users.  </s>
<s> If the prose is too "fluffy", let's unfluff it, not eliminate it entirely.  </s>
