<s> Brian dropped by and asked me what the key differences between S and TDL were.  </s>
<s> Here is a list: ** A single triple: bob age "30" .  </s>
<s> In S "30" is a string, in TDL it is untyped.  </s>
<s> ** Range constraints for this triple.  </s>
<s> In S-B the range constraint is something like: age rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> whereas in TDL (using the .map  </s>
<s> prefix that is not part of TDL) we would have: age rdfs:range xsd:integer.map .  </s>
<s> ** The role of the map, the lexical space, the value space.  </s>
<s> S makes strong distinctions between these.  </s>
<s> TDL always uses the map as representing the datatype (and then does not use the .map  </s>
<s> extenstion).  </s>
<s> ** syntactic stylistic The local idiom D and the local idiom S-A are different syntaxes, roughly meaning the same thing.  </s>
<s> D has better compatibility with DAML.  </s>
<s> ** interaction of multiple different lexicalizations with possibly multiply different types.  </s>
<s> S-A is strong S-B is weak TDL is in between.  </s>
<s> (An example is when we have two integer dataypes one with binary lexicalization and one with decimal lexicalization).  </s>
<s> S-B allows "100" with both types as legal (despite two different values to the application) S-A allows "100" as legal and the syntax forces disambiguation of one type or the other, S-A also allows compatible lexicalizations [eg:binary "100" ] [ eg:deciaml "4" ] on the same node.  </s>
<s> TDL detects a type conflict and rejects a document trying to give "100" both types.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> As I said in my discussion of how perl programmers might do datatyping in RDF, it's not necessarily the case that in S, "30" is a string; we could call them "scalars" if you don't like using "30" to represent an integer.  </s>
<s> What's necessarily the case is that in S, "30" denotes the same thing in all interpretaions, but in TDL it doesn't.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> In TDL (though not perhaps the current TDL MT, which should be revised) a literal is a literal is a literal.  </s>
<s> In the graph, it simply is a string that, IFF paired with a datatype, may be interpreted as a lexical form (a member of the lexical space of that datatype).  </s>
<s> This is just as with S. However, I do disagree with the statement that "30" always denotes the same thing in all interpretations -- as its interpretation is context specific, either per a given predicate or explicitly defined typing (local or global).  </s>
<s> In my latest illustration, showing that the TDL model (though not the TDL MT) is agnostic about, and hence compatable with tidy literals, the literal "30" has two interpretations.  </s>
<s> The literal itself is not always the same thing.  </s>
<s> A lexical form is always the same thing, per the definition of datatypes, lexical spaces, and mappings from lexcal spaces to value spaces -- but it is the interpretation of a literal that gives us the lexical form.  </s>
<s> The literal itself may be interpreted as many lexical forms, depending on the context form which a TDL is derived.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> But how do you know?  </s>
<s> If you don't define the datatype,  </s>
<s> or if your knowledge migrates out of the circle of your control?  </s>
<s> What if I need "30" to mean something else?  </s>
<s> What if it is  </s>
<s> supposed to be a monthDay?  </s>
<s> How about a human age in years?  </s>
<s> What if it is a magnitude of kilograms?  </s>
<s> And how could one assign some other interpretation either in S or TDL if "30" always denotes the same thing?  </s>
<s> I think that your argument has nothing to do with any limitation of TDL.  </s>
<s> I think you will encounter the same problems with S as well if you leave datatyping knowledge implicit in your application and yet expect your data values to be portable to other application spaces with the same interpretation.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> I don't know how to have a conversation like this.  </s>
<s> I'm using the word "interpretation" in the technical sense of our model theory working draft.  </s>
<s> I can't make sense of "its interpretation is context specific".  </s>
<s> You seem to have switched to some informal use of the word "interpretation".  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Because the specification says so.  </s>
<s> I don't know how to make sense of that.  </s>
<s> I doubt you really need "30" to mean something else.  </s>
<s> Zillions of perl and tcl programmers, for example, do just fine with just one kind of literal.  </s>
<s> I expect you just need to talk about something closely related to "30", such as the integer whose decimal (or octal or ...) numeral is "30".  </s>
<s> You can do that with S.  </s>
<s> All handled by S, to my satisfaction.  </s>
<s> I have working  </s>
<s> calendar applications, stuff that does mathmatical  </s>
<s> calculations, etc., all using S (S-B, in particular).  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/2000/01/sw/ .  </s>
<s> One doesn't.  </s>
<s> If one wants to refer to something other than the two character string '3' followed by '0', one uses a different expression than "30".  </s>
<s> After several months of implementation experience with S, I have not run into any problems with S.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> It's called the global semantic web, where RDF encoded knowledge is interchanged around the world between disparate applications.  </s>
<s> But, again, perl and tcl have *BUILT IN DATATYPES*.  </s>
<s> Sorry for shouting, but I keep having to repeat that point.  </s>
<s> RDF has *NO* built in datatypes -- therefore, all typing must have some explicit definition, either locally or globally, if we are to consistently interpret the literals to the values they are intended to denote.  </s>
<s> You seem to presume that your own, personal applications will provide the datatyping knowledge for interpretation, and that in such a context, you have no need of local or global datatyping mechanisms in RDF -- fine, that is true so long as you stay in your own little isolated bubble.  </s>
<s> If you expect to interchange knowledge freely around the world, then you'd better figure out how to express your datatyping knowledge (and expectations) in a portable way.  </s>
<s> The S approach seems contrary to the very purpose of having standardized datatypes -- so that applications know what to expect.  </s>
<s> S allows folks to change the rules on the fly, and that won't facilitate global interoperability.  </s>
<s> Fair enough, but there are other people who also need to be satisfied here, no?  </s>
<s> I'd love to take a look, but perhaps you could narrow the reference a bit, eh?  </s>
<s> And *how* dear sir will an application know what that *other* expression is supposed to mean.  </s>
<s> You seem to have a view that RDF is like a programming language with a well defined, native, built in set of datatypes with disjunct lexical spaces where there is a an implicit datatype membership determinable for every lexical form encountered.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure you are evaluating these datatyping proposals with the same scope of expectation that others (myself included) are.  </s>
<s> Good for you.  </s>
<s> How much of your data is globally exchanged with other applications?  </s>
<s> And do those applications share your implicit expectations regarding datatyping of literals?  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> I still don't see how this relates to the design choices at hand in any technical sense.  </s>
<s> Tcl has one datatype: strings.  </s>
<s> Perl has one (relevant) datatype: scalars.  </s>
<s> I suggest that RDF can do likewise.  </s>
<s> (see S, idiom B, for details).  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem to matter how many times each of us repeats his position; it's pretty clearly not going to convince the other.  </s>
<s> I think I have said what I have to say.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> The TCL/PL approach strikes me as having no datatyping in RDF -- but leaving all datatype interpretation to the application level.  </s>
<s> Fine.  </s>
<s> That's certainly an option.  </s>
<s> To leave RDF as it is, with no datatyping -- beyond saying that literals are Unicode strings -- and let applications and other standards address it; but I fear that that will have a significant impact on the utility of RDF for broad global interchange of knowledge.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
