<s> There are 2 reasons.  </s>
<s> First, it's essential that people be able to figure out whether they are reading the right spec.  </s>
<s> Redirect references and bindings are in the same space, but clearly bindings will be right for some applications and redirect references for others.  </s>
<s> There needs to be enough information for implementers to understand the basic differences and realize that there may be a spec that fits their needs better than this one.  </s>
<s> Second, it's often easier to communicate a concept by explaining what it is not than by explaining what it is.  </s>
<s> We have to do both, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> There have been continuing requests for binding-like behavior and for direct-reference-like behavior in redirect references.  </s>
<s> We can stop those requests and make it clearer what functionality we are trying to define here  </s>
