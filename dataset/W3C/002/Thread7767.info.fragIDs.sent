Thanks Greg... just two remarks.. 1. this list didn't have http://216.102.212.251/~webdav included which is working cool for me. 
2. Why I am getting these emails twice? 
Earlier I though I got this twice since its replied to two email list...but this time you just replied to w3c-dist-auth@w3.org and I got it twice..is everyone receiving twice? 
thanks, som.

I've CC'd Michael Best to add this reference. 
He maintains that page. 
[ Michael: it might be nice to also include information about which server is at those addresses.] 
I replied to you and CC'd the list. 
Presuming you're subscribed to the list, then you'll get two copies of the email.
