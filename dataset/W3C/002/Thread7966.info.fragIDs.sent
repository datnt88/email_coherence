<s> An issue regarding a LOCK response code in RFC2518.  </s>
<s> A quick search in the archives didn't show anything about this.  </s>
<s> In section 8.10.4, it states "If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, a 409 (Conflict) status code MUST be returned with a response entity body containing a multi-status XML element...". 1) The 409 status code is not listed in section 8.10.7 (LOCK status codes).  </s>
<s> 2) The example in section 8.10.10  </s>
<s> (Multi-resource LOCK request which fails) returns a 207 (Multi-status) response code, not a 409.  </s>
<s> The 207 response is normal for WebDAV methods that need to provide information about multiple-resources.  </s>
<s> I'm inclined to think the 207 is the correct response in such a failure case, which at first implies the 409 is wrong.  </s>
<s> However, I think the only case where a 409 is applicable is if one it trying to "create" a Lock Null Resource (LNR) (i.e. the null-resource does not exist) and where the ancestors of the LNR do not exist.  </s>
<s> I think this would be consistent with other methods as well (e.g. PUT, COPY, MOVE).  </s>
<s> Comments/clarification/etc please.  </s>

<s> Reposting as I've had no response to this.  </s>
<s> Am I correct in my assumption i.e. does the spec need updating?  </s>

<s> My vote would be that a 409 is the correct status code, and that 8.10.7 should be updated to reflect this.  </s>
<s> There will be other reasons why you would get a 409 (perhaps access control limitations), so this is just one of the reasons why you'd get a 409.  </s>
<s> I'd only return 207 when a Depth operation effectively caused the method to be applied independently to all the members of the collection, and this is not the case for a LOCK request, where a single lock-token is allocated (whose scope is the whole collection).  </s>

<s> This is DEEP_LOCK_ERROR_STATUS in the issues list: Original note at: For reference: mod_dav returns a 207.  </s>
<s> Assuming the other resources are locked, those response elements indicate 423 (Locked), and the Request-URI has a 424 (Failed Dependency) attached to it.  </s>
