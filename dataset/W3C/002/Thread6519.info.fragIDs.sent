To whom it may concern, 
Two of the anchors on your front page have rel="/Coopyright", which I presume should be rel="Copyright". 
Yours, Chris Hoess 
"/Coopyright" does not appear in the document source for http://www.w3.org/. 
Could you please give the URI where you see this?

This has been fixed. 
Sorry I misunderstood the first time! 
Many thanks for the report.
