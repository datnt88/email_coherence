<s> 1) In the MKRESOURCE response status codes, 423 Locked and 507 Insufficient storage are included; this seems unnecessary.  </s>
<s> 2518 specifies what these mean.  </s>
<s> You can't include the full set of valid status codes in responses to MKRESOURCE, else you'd have to include all the normal HTTP codes too, so why not just stick to new or changed codes?  </s>
<s> 2) MKRESOURCE responses "SHOULD NOT be cached" implies there are odd cases when it's okay to cache them, is this right?  </s>

<s> I kind of like having "typical response" listed in there.  </s>
<s> It makes it a bit easier to review expected responses given a certain set of conditions.  </s>
<s> No biggy if they stay or go, but figured that I'd throw in an opinion :-) Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> If anyone finds the inclusion of 423 and 507 helpful, I'd just as leave keep them.  </s>
<s> Greg has indicated that he does think it's useful to mention existing response codes that might be expected and the circumstances that might cause them to be returned.  </s>
<s> I know there was no discussion of this issue among the authors of the Redirect References spec.  </s>
<s> The definition of MKRESOURCE also appears in the DeltaV spec, for which it was originally drafted.  </s>
<s> Geoff, was there any discussion of SHOULD NOT vs. MUST NOT in the DeltaV working group?  </s>
<s> Unless there was some good reason for making the weaker statement, we should probably change it to MUST NOT in both specs.  </s>
<s> There has been no discussion of this issue in the versioning design team.  </s>
<s> I personally see no problem with the change from "SHOULD NOT" to "MUST NOT".  </s>
<s> I believe the wording was originally from Jim Whitehead.  </s>
<s> Jim?  </s>
