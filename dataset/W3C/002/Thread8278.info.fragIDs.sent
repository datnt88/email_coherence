<s> We've addressed all issues brought up, right?  </s>
<s> Count me as +1.  </s>
<s> We did.  </s>
<s> Basically the issues raised here fell into three categories...: 1) Specific problems in the spec (those have been resolved in draft 05 that we'd like to last-call).  </s>
<s> 2) General problems with the reference model introduced by the spec: the BIND spec specifies a very specific model; and this is the model it was supposed to specify.  </s>
<s> There are other possible models that behave slighty differently.  </s>
<s> One of them is the redirect reference model (separate spec), another is the "direct reference model" (that was mentioned in earlier versions of the REDIRECT spec, but as far as I can tell, nobody was interested to work on).  </s>
<s> There hasn't been any new discussion on this topic since Geoff's and my answers, so I'll assume it's resolved.  </s>
<s> 3) Issues with the organization and writing style of the spec.  </s>
<s> BIND adopts the same editorial style as RFC3253; and as there has been only one WG member finding problems with that, it seems that there's no change necessary.  </s>
<s> If more people feel differently about that, please speak up.  </s>
<s> That being said, the draft really should be last-called -- it has been in this close-to-be-last-called state for quite some time now.  </s>

<s> Let me phrase this differently: Will two parties which only read the text in the spec be able to write code independent of each other which interoperate?  </s>
<s> Is your view the answer to that question is 'Yes'?  </s>
<s> Patrik  </s>
<s> I think the answer is "yes", if the reader indeed boths reads and understands the normative references as well.  </s>
<s> Note that being more verbose has drawbacks, such as (1) reduced maintainability (if the same thing is described in different places) and (2) simply the size of the spec (I do remember the complaints about the length of the ACL spec; and BIND really really should be a simple spec).  </s>
<s> Also note that "interoperate" doesn't mean the same thing to everybody.  </s>
<s> In a perfect world, every implementation will behave exactly the same (generally only the case for systems that have a single-source implementation such as Perl).  </s>
<s> The BIND spec however simply can't invent new rules that are incompatible with it's base specs (HTTP, WebDAV...).  </s>
<s> So if things are already implementation-dependent for plain HTTP/WebDAV servers, things won't be different with BIND.  </s>
<s> That doesn't mean that software isn't interoperable; it just means that the spec in some cases simply has to allow different behaviours.  </s>
<s> Remember that BIND doesn't introduce a new concept or model, the concepz of multiple URIs mapped to the same resource is already present in HTTP, WebDAV and DeltaV (RFC3233); all the spec adds is...: - discoverability (is this the same resource as...? what bindings does this resource have...) - explitic authorability (make a new binding exactly here...) - specific new namespace operations where the HTTP/WebDAV-inherited methods (DELETE, MOVE) not always do the "right" thing for a BIND-aware system; and where the BIND spec couldn't change existing definitions (such as is a server allowed to do a "best-effort" MOVE?).  </s>
<s> So there are scenarios where server implementations *will* vary, but this is because HTTP and WebDAV servers *do* vary, not because the authors couldn't do better.  </s>
<s> For example: we've been asked to normatively specify the behaviour of HTTP ETags when bindings change.  </s>
<s> We simply can't, as there's an inherent conflict between the use case ETags were designed for (disambiguating represensations for the same URI), and the later addition of namespace operations in WebDAV.  </s>
<s> A server that doesn't have globally or at least server-wide unique ETags simply will have to do a fixup of ETags after namespace operations to prevent ETag collisions.  </s>
<s> There's nothing the BIND spec can do about that (however, the base spec RFC2518bis *should* recommend practices for selecting ETags that avoid this kind of post-namespace-op fixup).  </s>

<s> The bind spec is in an excellent shape to make interoperability between two parties more than likely.  </s>
<s> And if people want to shoot themselves into the foot, there's nothing a spec can do to prevent that.  </s>

<s> In my view, yes, two parties which only read the text in the spec (and the normative document it extends, i.e. RFC2518), will be able to write code independent of each other that interoperates.  </s>
<s> Since only one expert group member has had concerns in that regard, I think it is appropriate to last call the document, to determine whether a significant number of other readers share that concern.  </s>
