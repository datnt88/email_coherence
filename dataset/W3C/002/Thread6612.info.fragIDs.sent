I have adapted W3C Home page to XHTML Basic 1.0. 
It was far from difficult (*), 
and I also improved a little the CSS style to bottom aligning the three columns 
(an issue which has received some complains in this mailing list). 
:-) Please, take a look at http://www.it.uc3m.es/vlc/World.html and you will see the result (W3C Home page from 2002/12/06). 
I have also changed the logo to properly point to the XHTML Basic logo. 
You can validate it as XHTML Basic at Best regards. 
(*) Changes needed to improve W3C Home Page from XHTML Strict to XHTML Basic can be seen at . 
It was not difficult indeed. 
Only some minor changes at the page and at the CSS files. 
Very easy! 
With XHTML Basic, accessibility is much better improved.

Since bottom aligning does not properly work on Explorer (it works nice on Netscape, Mozilla and Opera), I have added an alternate stylesheet so the page can be seen with the proper stylesheet for every browser (so that the user can choose it, something present in some browsers like Mozilla). 
1.- Initial: 3 columns, without bottom aligning, as initially published by W3C 2.- Bottom aligining: 3 columns, with bottom aligning, not working on Explorer nor Konqueror (a problem from their CSS compliance), but working on others (Mozilla, Netscape and Opera). 
In any case, the page at http://www.it.uc3m.es/vlc/World.html is XHTML Basic 1.0. 
Minor changes to move from XHTML Strict to XHTML Basic don't really affect the layout, since the W3C Home layout relies on CSS. 
Bottom aligning is a matter of my change to the stylesheet, not of XHTML Basic. 
Best regards.

This looks great. 
I think we could consider XHTML Basic for a next step. 
Thank you for the suggestion and for your hard work.
