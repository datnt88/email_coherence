A DMS must have a lock that is persistent over time. 
The concept of a non-persistent lock is only valid during an on-line editing session (as opposed to a checked-out document). 
If we do specify lock time-out as a property of locking we must also define what the behavior of the lock will be if the document repository does not support a lock time-out feature.

Steve: While some DMS systems out there are designed around file locking, it is possible to have a fully functional remote DMS that does not use remote file locking. 
The Sun Teamware product is one such DMS. 
While Teamware is layered on top of SCCS (which has local file locking), the distributed authoring component of Teamware does not use remote file locks. 
Thus, the statement that "A DMS must have a lock that is persitent over time." should probably be restated to say "Some DMS's need persistent locks." 
Given the difficulty of managing remote locks, it may be appropriate to investigate a dist. 
authoring architecture that avoids the remote locking issue entirely.

File locking assumes that the DMS is using the file system as the underlying document storage system. 
Upscale DMSs will use some kind of database facility that will provide lock services is a different way, not via a file locking mechanism. 
The DMS sported by GroupWise 5 does not use any native file system but does provide for a persistent lock (plus much, much more). 
Anyway, I don't dispute that my statement could be better stated that "Some . 
. 
." but I don't agree with your suggestion not to privide for remote locking. 
If the DMS (or better stated, the document repository) supports a lock then it will provide the appropriate functionality, if not then an error message will be returned.
