<s> .. WHAT  is this Google promotion doing on the W3C front page?  </s>
<s> Google is a private, for-profit organization.  </s>
<s> I certainly would not expect to see the W3C providing promotions for private companies.  </s>
<s> My company has paid $5,000 for membership in the W3C.  </s>
<s> Can we have a promotion on your front page?  </s>
<s> Be assured that I will raise this issue as rapidly as possible to the highest possible level in the organization.  </s>

<s> Paul, Our search engine has been down for some time, and we have received a number of complaints that finding information on the public Web site and mailing lists is difficult as a result.  </s>
<s> We are currently investigating a solution that is more effective than our previous search facility.  </s>
<s> The Team decided that, until we have a long-term solution in place, it is so important that people be able to search the public Web site and mailing list archives, that we are willing to live for a short time with the Google logo on the home page (see part 3.3 of their terms and conditions [1]).  </s>
<s> This situation is temporary.  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Ian [1] http://www.google.com/services/terms_free.html  </s>

<s> Hello, Paul.  </s>
<s> Your message to site-comments received a quick response from Ian Jacobs, but there is more information that may be useful.  </s>
<s> The W3C Team has been in the process of evaluating the Google search service, and considering terms for use of their search technology for both the W3C Public and Member site.  </s>
<s> Google is the provider of the service, and carries terms and conditions for its use.  </s>
<s> In this case, W3C is using the Google product.  </s>
<s> There is nothing inconsistent or new with the use of the logo for a product we use.  </s>
<s> You should be aware that when we used Altavista as our search engine, we also were obliged to carry the logo for both Altavista and Compaq (who donated the server) on the search pages and the results.  </s>
<s> Altavista, the spinoff company, was not a Member either.  </s>
<s> As Head of Communications for W3C, I had already spoken with our director about the use of the Google Logo on our site.  </s>
<s> Given the Google current T&amp;Cs, and that Google gives us an effective, operable search facility, he approved the use.  </s>
<s> Should you have further questions, please feel free to write to me directly.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Janet  </s>
