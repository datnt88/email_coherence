<s> Guys, is there an up-to-date summary of the complete RDF and RDFS vocabulary anywhere, taking into account all the changes we have decided on?  </s>
<s> I'd like to get the MT document towards the stage where it at least mentions everything, if only to say that it isn't giving it any particular meaning.  </s>
<s> In a similar vein, I presume that the new daml-style rdf:Collections should be put into the MT document as well.  </s>
<s> Any objections?  </s>

<s> (rdf:Collections isn't a new term however) The new rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil vocabulary will be added to the syntax doc, in the section/URI above.  </s>
<s> The detail of how they *work* will be elsewhere in a section yet to be written.  </s>
