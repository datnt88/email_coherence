<s> A few comments: 1.  </s>
<s> In section 1, it says "RDF is based on a graph syntax, which is typically serialized using XML.".  </s>
<s> I think it would be good to make clear here that the RDF graph syntax is not equivalent to the XML infoset, and that the XML serialization really constitutes a "recipe" for constructing the conceptual graph.  </s>
<s> Alot of folks seem to get confused when the RDF graph doesn't mirror the RDF/XML or visa versa, so making this clear up front may be helpful.  </s>
<s> 2. In section 2, it says "RDF builds on XML".  </s>
<s> I don't think this is accurate.  </s>
<s> RDF uses XML to serialize its graph structures, but is not an extension of XML, but only includes an application of XML. 3. In 2.2, a stated design goal is "Use XML schema datatypes".  </s>
<s> I think it would be better to say "Support the use of XML Schema datatypes".  </s>
<s> Otherwise, it may be taken to imply that XML Schema datatypes are integrated with or into RDF directly, which they are not (and IMO should not be).  </s>
<s> Ahh, yes, I see that this is clearer in the discussion of this bullet item, but still, perhaps the bullet item could be clearer.  </s>
<s> 4. In 2.4.3, perhaps "are not covered by this recommendation."  </s>
<s> could be expressed more strongly as "are not licensed by this recommendation for interchange of RDF graphs".  </s>
