<s> I did not get to make a presentation on MusicBrainz at the F2F, however I did feel it was important that I share with you the top issues that Rob Kaye, the head of the MusicBrainz project, had while working with RDF: - Make RDF specs easier to understand The spec focuses too much on the serialization.  </s>
<s> The BNF directly in the spec is useful, but really misleading.  </s>
<s> The focus of the spec ought to be more on the graph that is created, rather than the serialization of that graph.  </s>
<s> - Provide more guidelines for creating vocabularies o What should be specified as part of a vocabulary?  </s>
<s> o Provide a sample vocabulary!  </s>
<s> o Should/must a vocabulary have an RDF Schema?  </s>
<s> - Provide a syntax that isn't as verbose o It should also be more intuitive.  </s>
<s> I think Sergey Melnik's approach seems reasonable: (http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/syntax.html)  </s>
<s> - Do you have any tips on how to write a vocabulary spec for inclusion into IETF spec?  </s>
<s> Drew Streib @ freedb wants to use MM for CD lookups and he wants to push this through the IETF.  </s>
<s> Has this been done before for an RDF vocab?  </s>

<s> Hi Aaron, Thanks for this.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry you couldn't stay for the full time.  </s>
<s> The short presentations did get squeezed into the last 45 mins or so of the meeting.  </s>
<s> It does occur to me that it might be a good idea to tidy up the list from the flip charts and any other contributions such as this folks would like to make into a consolidated list.  </s>
<s> To do that would require two actions: o folks who have knowledge of direct user experience with RDF, to summarize the top issues users had to the list - as Aaron has just done for MusicBrainz  </s>
<s> o someone to volunteer to make the summary Brian  </s>
<s> Here's one I did: (This draft is currently expired, but still online (as of today).  </s>
<s> I do intend to refresh it and complete the spec when some other work comes to fruition -- real soon, I hope.) You may note that, in this case, I've focused on presenting the XML and brining in the RDF as an "afterthought".  </s>
<s> It was very easy to sell this approach to one of our developers for inclusion into a product.  </s>
<s> There is one problem with this that I think will be difficult to resolve to the complete satisfaction of all: addresses are URIs, but presented as RDF literals.  </s>
<s> It is my belief that, at this time, it would be very difficult to sell the idea of using rdf:resource= in this context.  </s>
<s> (I would hope that, in due course, we could use an RDF schema with an xsdt:anyURI data type on the literal value and some inference rules to knit the graph together, but that would be outside standard RDF.) #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group The information contained in this message is confidential and is intended for the addressee(s) only.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure if this counts as "user" experience, but these are the RDF-related issues I would have raised in presenting our experimental workw ith RDF, which we hope will lead to applications in trust modelling... Issues in use of RDF Encoding of facts and rules * Facts subj pred arg2 .  </s>
<s> subj rdf:type monad .  </s>
<s> subj pred (arg2 arg3 ...) .  </s>
<s> It's easier to start with facts expressed using n-place predicates --s-expressions--; we've thought about coding these in RDF's triple-basedn otation.  </s>
<s> Some current thoughts are at: * Rules Need a ?handle? to the fact -- a URI: Reification can do this ?  </s>
<s> [ a rdf:Statement ; rdf:subject subj ; rdf:predicate pred ; rdf:object ( arg2 arg3 ... ) ] Similar, but not reification: ?  </s>
<s> [ a Fact ; functor pred ; args ( subj arg2 arg3 ... ) ] From discussions held since these notes were made, I think we may do better to avoid reification for this purpose, if only to avoid confusion over the intent.  </s>
<s> * Variables Resource ?stands  </s>
<s> for?  </s>
<s> a variable: [ a Variable ; rdfs:label ??x? ] I think this parallels the "prince" node resolution we discussed: the "variable name" is used for certain kinds of presentation, but has no inherent significance (noting that rdfs:label is described as being for presentation purposes rather than identification).  </s>
<s> Further work ?  </s>
<s> Capturing provenance: contexts?  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> e.g. StatedBy( http:/foo.bar.com/doc, { s1(a,b,...) s2(c,d,...) ... } ) I don't think any of these issues bear directly on what we are contemplating at the present, but suggest future issues for RDF-based applications and generic tools.  </s>
