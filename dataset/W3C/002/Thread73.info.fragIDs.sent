<s> Dear Dave, dear Matej and others, thank you very much for your quick response to my mail from 9 june concerning the strong tag in the page title and what tidy does with it and my problems with the -config option of tidy.  </s>
<s> I'm running tidy with the HTML_TIDY environment variable now and everything works fine.  </s>
<s> Thanks Matej!  </s>
<s> Matej notified me that the example files I attached with my last mail were the same.  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> Here I have attached a second try, tidybug2.zip,  </s>
<s> containing pretidy.html posttidy.html  </s>
<s> tidyerrors tidy.ini  </s>
<s> This time pretidy.html and posttidy.html  </s>
<s> should look different.  </s>

<s> I am still unsure of how to proceed.  </s>
<s> I can improve the error message when the parser finds other tags within title, but the problem may be caused by forgetting the end tags rather than thinking that emphasis is allowed within title.  </s>
<s> Its not obvious how to repair this.  </s>

<s> Well, now the files are clear, I see what you mean.  </s>
<s> However, the main question remains (as Dave already put it) -- what is tidy supposed to do?  </s>
<s> Maybe, the best thing would be to get rid off strong element only.  </s>
<s> I am not sure.  </s>
<s> What do you think, Dave?  </s>
