<s> I wouldn't want to see n-triples in the general examples.  </s>
<s> In the MT section(s) they are more concise than XML, but I've been thinking that, if n-triples are not normative, then we shouldn't have them in any normative sections.  </s>
<s> Thus, we should use only RDF/XML and graphic representations in the normative sections of all specifications.  </s>

<s> If it is, excluding N-triples creates a bit of a problem doesn't it?  </s>
<s> Second, isn't what's normative in RDF the graph in the mathematical sense?  </s>
<s> Both N-triples and the drawings are legitimate representations of (mathematical) graphs aren't they?  </s>
<s> Finally, it seems to me the WG has been fairly consistent in acting as if using N-triples actually clarified things.  </s>
<s> If that's true, they ought to be great in examples!  </s>
