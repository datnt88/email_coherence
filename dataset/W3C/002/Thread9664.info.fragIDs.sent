11: How to represent triples in documents. 
Propose that triples should be represented using correct n-triples. 
See: 
12: Datatyping WD Is this document ready for first publication? 
Are the editors agreed? 
See: 13: Issue: rdfs-online-char-encoding Propose: o action Eric to update the schema file with the appropriate character encoding declaration o close this issue See: 14: Issue: rdfs-container-membership-superProperty Propose: o the WG resolves to define rdfs:contains, a common superproperty of the containermembership properties. 
o actions Danbri to add this definition to RDF schema. 
See: 15: Issue: rdfs-constraining-containers Is it possible to constrain the members of a container to be of a given type? 
Propose: o the WG resolves that expressing such a constraint is beyond the scope of RDFS. 
Such functionality belongs with more powerful ontology languages such as daml+oil and owl. 
o The WG notes that DAML+OIL can express this constraint as described in: o The WG closes this issue See: 16: Issue: rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property Summary: Can an instance of the Property class have a subClassOf property? 
What does this mean? 
Propose the WG resolves: o an instance of the Property class may have an rdfs:subClassOf property o the meaning of such a property is defined by the model theory o this issue be closed See: 17: daml:collection See:

19: Suggest after hours discussion of dark triples This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant 
I wouldn't want to see n-triples in the general examples. 
In the MT section(s) they are more concise than XML, but I've been thinking that, if n-triples are not normative, then we shouldn't have them in any normative sections. 
Thus, we should use only RDF/XML and graphic representations in the normative sections of all specifications.

If we get to 
the following message was my last attempt at proposing a resolution: (the examples screwed up and can be found in: i.e. od-uri.htm 
There was some discussion with I18N folks in that thread, which I read as consent to the proposal. 
Jeremy 
I'd like something clarified about this. 
First, isn't Test Cases normative? 
If it is, excluding N-triples creates a bit of a problem doesn't it? 
Second, isn't what's normative in RDF the graph in the mathematical sense? 
Both N-triples and the drawings are legitimate representations of (mathematical) graphs aren't they? 
Finally, it seems to me the WG has been fairly consistent in acting as if using N-triples actually clarified things. 
If that's true, they ought to be great in examples!

What we've actually used is N-triples + (informal) namespaces. 
I think an introduction to such an informal notation in the primer, in which we identify all the namespaces used anywhere in any of the documents would be OK. ANd then all the documents that want to use the notation. 
MT is special because it needs mathematical variables but that's cool, I think the current text is aimed at a mathematical audience (e.g. starting from section 0) and is clear for such an audience. 
e.g. 
In the RDF recommendations examples are often written down in an informal triples notation. 
This is related to the N-triples notation used in the test cases but uses abbreviated namespaces, as in XML qnames, rather than full URIrefs. 
For example, the n-triple: http:the-rdfs-url#Property . is informally written as: eg:foo rdf:type rdfs:Property . 
Other namespace abbreviations used in the examples are: 
rdfd dc and similarly in the MT Pat could extend this informal notation with variables. 
Informal != unclear.

no, that's ambiguous as to whether eg:foo is a qname or a URIref. 
If you want to use qnames, drop the  s: eg:foo rdf:type rdfs:Property.
