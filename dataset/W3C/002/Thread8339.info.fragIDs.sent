<s> In the past, when we defined new status codes I looked at the latest HTTP specification, and then all HTTP-related RFCs (of any status, be they Informational, Experimental, Proposed, Draft, etc.) and drafts likely to become RFCs (such as drafts of the Draft standard HTTP as it was being defined), composing the union of all status codes.  </s>

<s> (sorry for my previous empty mail)  </s>
<s> I absolutely agree that 207 is lame -- for a successful response, 200 should have been just fine.  </s>
<s> However, this doesn't seem to be a real issue, as long as we use 207 only as a status for successfull requests, such as a typical PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> The suggestion not to specify any new error code is interesting, and we should really discuss how far we can go this path.  </s>
<s> Proposal: define that servers may send a DAV:multistatus or a DAV:error (RFC3253) body with any 4xx and 5xx response.  </s>
<s> Use DAV:multistatus for failures that affected resources other than the one identified by the request URI, and DAV:error (optionally) otherwise.  </s>
<s> Clients would then initiate the DAV:multistatus / DAV:error evalutations independantly of the response code (do we need a new content type?  </s>
<s> I don't think so).  </s>
<s> Let's try some examples: 1) A collection delete fails because the server couldn't delete one of it's children (privileges missing): HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden (note that we wouldn't include a response for the parent collection(s) as per result minimization rules) 2) A collection delete fails because the server couldn't delete one of it's children (I/O error because some other process on the server has the actual file in the filesystem opened): HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error 3) PROPPATCH on a protected property HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden This really seems to work quite well.  </s>
<s> So can anybody think of a reason why we would need a new return code?  </s>
