Don't worry -- there are a number of DMA folks on this distribution list, and we are also looking at how your work compares to and might interact with ours. 
Some of your recent discussions are amusing, since we've been through those issues.

Amusing? 
If you have already been down this path then why don't you share your experience with us? 
There are no points for being the stoic silent one.

When I was associated with DMA (Novell's Representative) I remember us working on a lot of infrastructure. 
What the Distributed Authoring folks are doing is developing protocols to make collaborative documents a reality. 
Surely DMA and the work of the wg will cross. 
I would hope that DMA would participate rather than be "amused" by the efforts of the working group. 
As well, there are two DMA members sitting on the working group, Xerox and Novell. 
I can speak for Novell in saying that we hope to see the efforts of the working group make our DMS more globally available via standard IETF approved protocols.

Last time I checked, there were employees of the following DMA member companies on the distribution of this list (in no particular order): Xerox PARC, Xerox XSoft, Filenet, Alpharel, Saros, Documentum, Novell. 
I'd like to echo Steve's hope that the wisdom acquired through DMA efforts to date would make it's way into the distributed authoring and versioning specification. 
I have always received valuable insight into the distributed authoring and versioning issue space from my past interactions with DMA members, and I have no doubt this will continue in the future. 
I have also been very glad for the participation of those members of this working group who have a document management background, as I feel they have made significant contributions towards all products of this working group to date. 
I also appreciate it when people indicate an issue is a "rathole," since this is not always evident at the time. 
As a general rule, I would like this group to benefit from existing work, reinventing as little as possible.
