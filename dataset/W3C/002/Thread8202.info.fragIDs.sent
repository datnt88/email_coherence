The W3C has decided to treat link roles as URIs. 
If we decide to define a different mechanism, we will sooner or later have to define a mapping of XLink role URIs to our role schema (because other systems with which a WebDAv server connect may have decided to use standard Xlink roles). 
I assume Geoff or others will respond to this and hopefully also to my questions. 

Furthermore this brings *us* into the business of defining roles (I think the spec should only define a mechanism to marshall them, that's it). 
By *US* I take it you mean the WebDAV community. 
Is it your view that some non-WebDAV entity will end up defining XLink roles that are also pertainent to WebDAV? 
Not exactly the WebDAV community in total, but the subset of it actively working on fixing RFC2518. 
Regarding role URIs: yes, I'd expect this: see, for instance: BTW: just because a role is identified by a URI, it doesn't need to be 
opaque. 
For instance, the role URI may identify a HTTP-GETtable resource in a specific format. 
There's a reason why the ACL spec identifies principals by URI instead of marshalling all principal information in each PROPFIND, right?

I'm happy to have one of the role elements be an href, and have this href be the XLink role URI, e.g.: P.S. I know that isn't what Julian was suggesting, but I believe it answers his concerns while still letting 
the WebDAV role be an extensible element. 
Cheers, Geoff I don't think this a good idea.

Julian -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Jason Crawford I've made a proposal in the following post... 
There have been several suggestions. 
I'd like to focus on one of them. 
The suggestion is the suggestion to make the role be a tag rather than an attribute. 
The justification was that this could allow for structured roles. 
That actually sounds good to me in principle, but I'd like to make sure we're actually likely to capitalize on it. 
Could someone suggest some roles that they'd like to see. 
Also if you can think of any *structured* roles, please put them on the table so that we can at least see how that might work. 
Thanks, J. 
Reducing the scope of the purpose of the source property is good in theory. 
However, this does not resolve the issue, because it only discusses *theoretical* interoperability. 
To proceed to Draft Standard, we need *actual interoperability*. 
Are there two servers and two clients out there who have implemented the source property already? 
If so, we need to test them at the interop in September or online. 
Are there two servers and two clients who would implement and use the source property in a form close to its current definition, but have not done so yet? 
If so, what's blocking you from actually implementing it? 
Is it that it is missing roles, or is something else required? 
We can't have our cake and eat it too. 
We have to do the work of implementing and testing interoperability if we want to keep source and move to Draft Standard. 
Lisa Okay... Julian, Geoff and Roy makes 3:0. 
Unless I hear some dissenting opinions, it looks like we should make it clear in the spec that the dav:source property is only serving a specific purpose (2, 3, and possibly 4) and use beyond that is not interoperable. 
Wow... we might actually resolve this issue this time. 
:-) J. 
Okay guys, We've gotten stuck again on this topic. 
We last left the discussion back near July 1 where I asked us to try to resolve the issue of whether we use the XLink approach to roles or if we use dav:href tags. 
Julian has advocated XLink... Geoff has advocated dav:href But no one responded to them and the discussion died. 
Lisa asks and requests that we demonstrate interoperability at the upcoming iterop. 
If we don't, the source property will need to be removed so that webdav can continue down the standards track. 
If you feel it's important to retain the source property in the next draft of WebDAV you should speak up now. 
Who plans to implement dav:source in their offerings? 
Jason. 
Hi, let's start at the end: the issue seems to be that none of the servers is actually planning to add DAV:source support. 
So the answer to Lisa would be: we can't come up with a solution in time for the next draft, so the feature should be dropped (well, or the schedule changed). 
Funny enough, the question of to XLink or not is now a TAG issue, and I'm very interested to see what the outcome will be... :-) Julian
