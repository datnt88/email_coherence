Dear Sir; 
We are looking for the newest version of tidy from dated 2000/08/16. 
We have an issue with this release : We cannot have two different version of xalan loaded into different classloader in our 
applications. 
Moreover, we cannot recompile the tidy with the new version of xalan because the tidy was based on the old org.w3c.dom package. 
I just wondering whether you have new version available or you may have better solutions. 
I appreciate your time.

So you are looking for a new version of *J*Tidy? 
Yes. We are looking for the new Tidy compatible with the current xalan. 
I am so surprised to see the source code date was back to two years.

Last time I heard from JTidy developers they were waiting for the C version of Tidy to make a release to backport it later. 
Tidy-C however has not been updated for almost 3 years now, at least we did not make a stable release, experimental sources and binaries are available from tidy.sf.net. 
Note that some people worked on JNI interface for Tidy, try searching the archives.
