<s> I guess so  </s>
<s> I'd like to see some proof of that.  </s>
<s> xsi:type is defined by XML Schema.  </s>
<s> If RDF is going to use it for non XML Schema datatypes, then is it not the case that RDF is extending the semantics and usage of xsi:type beyond that defined by XML Schema?!  </s>
<s> I've got major alarm bells going off in my head about this one -- not to mention a very bad taste in my mouth.  </s>
<s> XML Schema is not the only schema formalism for XML, and even though both XML Schema and RDF are both "children" of the W3C, I don't see that they need to be so tightly integrated in this fashion.  </s>
<s> 3. Will this work with arbitrarily/user defined primitive types?  </s>
<s> I guess so  </s>
<s> Again, does that not mean that RDF is extending the semantics and usage of xsi:type beyond that defined by XML Schema?  </s>
<s> 4. How does this relate to defining datatype ranges of properties?  </s>
<s> well I guess global range constraints could be used to detect inconsistencies, no?  </s>
<s> So, is it the case that IF :s :p DDD "LLL" .  </s>
<s> THEN DDD "LLL" rdf:type DDD .  </s>
<s> That's not adding *anything* new to the functionality already provided by the stake-in-the-ground idiom for local datatyping.  </s>
<s> The WG agreed that the stake-in-the-ground would *not* be changed unless there was strong technical motivation.  </s>
<s> Where is it?! How does the datatype property idiom fail?! Something doesn't smell quite right here...  </s>
<s> (too much guesses I guess)  </s>
<s> This is what really bothers me.  </s>
<s> We have spent many months coming to consensus on key aspects of datatyping, and IMO there remained only one single issue left to decide, whether literals had tidy or untidy syntax/semantics -- and now it seems like we're back at square one and anything goes.  </s>
<s> Was there *any* dissent in the WG about the local idiom and its semantics?  </s>
<s> I don't recall any.  </s>
<s> What's the deal?! Patrick  </s>

<s> Just for the reference, the "range" of xsi:type is QName, so I guess it  </s>

<s> 2. Will this work with non-XML Schema datatypes?  </s>
<s> Well, the XML Schema spec explicitly mentions that xsi:type is used to specify a Simple Type (?2.2.1.2) or Complex Type (?2.2.1.3) so it is IMO reasonable for any application that sees xsi:type to presume that the datatype in question conforms to XML Schema.  </s>
<s> So, even if the "range" of xsi:type is a QName, that QName is expected to denote an XML Schema type.  </s>
<s> No?  </s>

<s> 2. Will this work with non-XML Schema datatypes?  </s>
<s> This is not my reading.  </s>
<s> The first sentence of the paragraph refers to a usual case when the type is determined by the type associated with the XML element in the schema (i.e., no xsi:type is used).  </s>
<s> However, when xsi:type is there, its value is a QName, nothing said about it referring to an XSD type definition or anything else.  </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong... Sergey  </s>
