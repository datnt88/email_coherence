I'm not your QA. Immediately remove this address fro your database.

There's is no need to be agressive ! 
What I'm trying to explain you is in the W3C FAQ : that you have read, as any sysadmin or user complaining about spam coming from W3C has, haven't you ? 
You even didn't quote the message we were supposed to be responsible for. 
I will be happy to help you if you did me the common courtesy of sending the message and the headers.
