Hi all, what's a relativ namespace URI? 
Absolute: "http://www.w3.org/Signature/" Relative: "../blah" Relative: "blah" 
But what's with things like "http://www.w3.org/../blah"

The path part is absolute if it starts with a "/". 
In your last example "/../blah" is an absolute path because it assumes a root starting place while "../blah" is relative to wherever you happen to 
Thanks, Christian 
The path part is absolute if it starts with a "/". 
In your last example "/../blah" is an absolute path because it assumes a root starting place while "../blah" is relative to wherever you happen to be. 
Any complete "//" type URI, that is, one with "scheme://" in it, has to be absolute because the path part starts with a "/" and the root is defined by the stuff before that "/". 
So in your last example, "http://www.w3.org" defines a root (probably as part of the configuration of that http server) and "/../blah" navigates from that root. 
It is absolute because it is indpendent of the context ("web page") where this URL occurs.
