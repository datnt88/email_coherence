Frank, your prose in section 4.1 of the primer mentions rdf:li as a convenience element generic XML version of container membership properties. 
My recollection is that we had decided to deprecate or even forbid rdf:li in this way, however (??) on the grounds that there was in general no way to assign numerical properties to the instances of rdf:li. 
We ought to get this straight one way or the other. 
If we still have 
rdf:li, can anyone tell me how to map RDF/XML into a graph? 
Another matter, if we keep rdf:li, then your reference to 'list element' is potentially confusing given the use of 'list structure' in the next section to refer to something completely different.

Well, rdf:li is described in Section 2.15 of the current Syntax WD without any hint of deprecation or forbidding that I can see. 
Good point. 
Assuming rdf:li is still legit, I'll fix this.

I think you are a bit confused Pat. 
rdf:li is a syntax name; it has 
never been an RDF property, class or whatever. 
We have thus never deprecated or forbidden it. 
Just to be clear; RDF as we have revised has changed two names in the RDF namespace rdf:aboutEach rdf:aboutEachPrefix - syntax only devices, now removed (we've added some of course) The definitive words for rdf: things: 5.1 The RDF Namespace 
including: [[Syntax names - not concepts RDF Description ID about bagID parseType resource li nodeID datatype

Yes, I was. 
I have to say, this idea of a 'syntax name' that isn't actually a name *is* very confusing, particularly when it sure LOOKS like a name. 
Im still puzzled about how it's supposed to actually work. 
Seems to me that the actual graph formed from some RDF/XML which uses rdf:li can vary from moment to moment at the whim of the parser, since it depends on some ordering that isnt specified in the syntax. 
Well, its ours, right? 
I mean, its in our namespace? 
It starts with 'rdf:', after all. 
OK, thanks. 
Now Im puzzled about something else. 
I've been using rdf:Datatype as a class name. 
Is that a mistake?? 
Pat PS. BTW, you say there that 'any other names are not defined and SHOULD generate a warning when encountered' which seems a bit strong. 
That means for example that any OWL vocabulary is going to generate an RDF warning. 
In fact, any RDFS vocabulary is going to generate an RDF warning.

An (XML) namespace we've been using as a set of names. 
Some of these names are not used in triples, just for rdf/xml; I've tried several ways to say that, and syntax name is about as snappy as I've got. 
The rdf:li syntax in rdf/xml does emit a different property as it is used in the document, but the exact rdf:_n property emitted is well defined and the same for each mapping of rdf/xml to triples. 
So, you 
don't need to worry about it :) 
Yes, we have control over that. 
Note the case &amp; namespace difference rdfs:Datatype rdf:type rdfs:Class See RDF Vocab rdf:datatype - just a bit of rdf/xml syntax used to give the URI for Typed Literals See RDF/XML Syntax 2.9 Typed Literals - rdf:datatype 
I said "... not defined" in the context of the RDF namespace. 
That is so that if someone uses a name we don't list, such as rdf:foo, it gives a warning. 
Other vocab will be in a different namespace (RDFS, OWL, ...) Dave

No. That's correct. 
Note the case distinction. 
rdf:datatype is purely a syntactic term in the RDF/XML serialization. 
rdfs:Datatype is a class in the RDFS vocabulary, the set of datatypes. 
The relationship is very similar to that between rdf:resource and rdfs:Resource. 
Patrick 
That's right. 
Pat: are you satisfied? 
Brian 
Yes. Default: if I don't compain, Im satisfied.
