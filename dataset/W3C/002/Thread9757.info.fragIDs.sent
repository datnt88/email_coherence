<s> Frank, your prose in section 4.1 of the primer mentions rdf:li as a convenience element generic XML version of container membership properties.  </s>
<s> My recollection is that we had decided to deprecate or even forbid rdf:li in this way, however (??) on the grounds that there was in general no way to assign numerical properties to the instances of rdf:li.  </s>
<s> We ought to get this straight one way or the other.  </s>
<s> If we still have  </s>
<s> rdf:li, can anyone tell me how to map RDF/XML into a graph?  </s>
<s> Another matter, if we keep rdf:li, then your reference to 'list element' is potentially confusing given the use of 'list structure' in the next section to refer to something completely different.  </s>

<s> Well, rdf:li is described in Section 2.15 of the current Syntax WD without any hint of deprecation or forbidding that I can see.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>

<s> I have to say, this idea of a 'syntax name' that isn't actually a name *is* very confusing, particularly when it sure LOOKS like a name.  </s>
<s> Im still puzzled about how it's supposed to actually work.  </s>
<s> Seems to me that the actual graph formed from some RDF/XML which uses rdf:li can vary from moment to moment at the whim of the parser, since it depends on some ordering that isnt specified in the syntax.  </s>
<s> Well, its ours, right?  </s>
<s> I mean, its in our namespace?  </s>
<s> It starts with 'rdf:', after all.  </s>
<s> OK, thanks.  </s>
<s> Now Im puzzled about something else.  </s>
<s> I've been using rdf:Datatype as a class name.  </s>
<s> Is that a mistake??  </s>
<s> Pat PS. BTW, you say there that 'any other names are not defined and SHOULD generate a warning when encountered' which seems a bit strong.  </s>
<s> That means for example that any OWL vocabulary is going to generate an RDF warning.  </s>
<s> In fact, any RDFS vocabulary is going to generate an RDF warning.  </s>
