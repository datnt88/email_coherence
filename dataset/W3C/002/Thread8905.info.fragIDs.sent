I'm struggling to wrap my mind around both the XML-Signature CR and the canonicalization REC, so please bear with me if this is a dumb question. 
Background item 1: Sections 2.1 and 6.5.1 give examples of the CanonicalizationMethod element like the following: CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/ 
Background item 2: Section 1.1 of the Canonical XML Version 1.0 Recommendation states, "Empty elements are converted to start-end tag pairs," and the processing model for element nodes described in section 2.3 ensures that this is the case. 
Query: Are the XML-Signature examples correct? 
It seems to me that they should read: CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315" /Canonicalizati onMethod and that other empty elements (SignatureMethod, Transform, DigestMethod) in the example in section 2.1 should likewise be represented as start-end tag pairs. 
If this is not the case, what have I missed?

Background item 1 refers to the XML-Signature CR. Sorry for the ambiguity. 
Examples in the dsig spec are not canonicalized. 
I added a sentence to [s03], "Note that this example, and all examples in this specification, are not in canonical form."

That makes sense for all examples except the two I cited. 
Since those are examples of specifying a CanonicalizationMethod, shouldn't they be represented using that method? 
It seems confusing to give examples that are invalid. 
If I understand the spec correctly, you couldn't actually validate the example in 2.1, which is represented as a (presumably correct) detached signature of the content of the XHTML 1.0 recommendation.

There is no need for the SignedInfo to be in canonical form if the SignatureValue was calculated using the canonical form and is verified using the canonical form. 
That this was done for generation and is to be done for verification is whatthe content of CanonicalizationMethod means.

Of course. 
Thanks for clarifying.
