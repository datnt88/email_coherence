<s> Recently, there've been a wave of criticism of the S proposal on the list.  </s>
<s> I'd like to address a central concern here.  </s>
<s> It seems that S is disliked by some because it seems to suggest a certain "idiom", or "data coding style", which deviates from many existing use cases.  </s>
<s> I've pointed out many times that this idiom is not the only way of using S, but this issue keeps being catcalled over and over again,  </s>
<s> sometimes using very unconstructive arguments.  </s>
<s> To remind, the essence of the S proposal is to denote datatype mappings using RDF properties.  </s>
<s> I believe this is easy enough to understand.  </s>
<s> Doing so enables two things: 1) referring to value space and lexical space of a datatype mapping explicitly 2) referring to individual elements of value spaces explicitly This is pretty much it.  </s>
<s> The document I've been working on illustrates one possible idiom of how elements of *value spaces* can be used and referred to by applications.  </s>
<s> Let me call it "Idiom A": Idiom A Range of a property like dc:date is defined as the *value space* of a datatype: dc:date --rdfs:range-- [] --rdfs:domain-- xsd:duration Therefore, to refer to individual elements of the value space we write: X --dc:date- [] --xsd:duration-- "2001-12-04"  </s>
<s> Idiom B Another way of using datatype mappings is to define the range of a property as the *lexical space* of a datatype: dc:date --rdfs:range-- [] --rdfs:range-- xsd:duration  </s>
<s> Therefore, we write: X --dc:date- "2001-12-04" In this case, the property values of dc:date are lexical tokens that belong to the lexical space of xsd:duration.  </s>
<s> However, since there is exactly one duration value that corresponds to each lexical token, applications may exploit this fact to determine what durations are meant.  </s>
<s> Epilogue Proposal S *does not* state that A, B or some other idiom is the best, normative way of modeling typed values (although the document I've been working on focuses on A so far).  </s>
<s> Most of the time, whether we use A or B is plain irrelevant given a scope of a specific application, as long as the one or the other idiom is used consistently.  </s>
<s> Complications arise when we start integrating different applications, or when more sophisticated datatype modeling is required (like union of types in XSD).  </s>
<s> My belief is that for such involved scenarios the Idiom A is superior.  </s>
<s> As part of that wave, I would like to acknowledge that idiom B is an interesting way forward that I had not appreciated before; sorry for not having read all the messages adequately.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> "the range of a property" is an ill-formed definite description; a property can have lots different classes as ranges.  </s>
<s> Not to mention that a bnode can't be the object of two different statements in RDF/xml.  </s>
<s> We can use this idiom if, as Graham suggested[1], we pick names for "the lexical space of the xsd:duration datatype"; say, rdfd:durationLexicalSpace. Of course, once we pick it, we would say xsd:duration rdfs:range rdfd:durationLexicalSpace.  </s>
<s> I think Idiom B is much akin to PL[2].  </s>
<s> I like the idea that - we give names to all three (lexical, value, mapping) parts of each of the primitive datatypes  </s>
<s> - we explain how to use them (PL/S-B, S-A) - we let users choose  </s>
