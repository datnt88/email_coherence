<s> Yes: it seems simple to me.  </s>
<s> Have a Location which the core can use to fetch the document for verification; but don't include the Location in SignedInfo, otherwise moving the document breaks the signature (at least, as far as the core is concerned).  </s>

<s> Isn't it as simple as that?  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph, It's not confusing us at all.  </s>
<s> We accept your definition as far as it goes; it just doesn't go very far.  </s>
<s> The problem is that we are not just trying to write a spec but rather trying to figure out how to build the thing.  </s>
<s> When you say that "there is a set of XML documents that... yield DigestContent", what does that mean.  </s>
<s> *Something* has to yield DigestContent does it not?  </s>
<s> If we don't say how specifically the DigestContent will be 'yielded' then it is meaningless to then say that we digest it and compare the result to the one in DigestValue.  </s>
<s> So, how specifically do you propose that we obtain the DigestContent?  </s>
<s> It is either defined by core behavior or it is defined by the application.  </s>
<s> By saying "there is a set S of XML documents that, when transformed, yields DigestContent" but nothing more, are you making the a priori assumption that it is the application's problem to find a member M of the set S? Once we have M, is it core behavior or application-specific behavior to apply the transforms to M, yielding M'?  </s>
<s> Once we have M', is it core behavior or application behavior to apply the DigestMethod to M' yielding DigestValue (or in verification, something that can be compared with DigestValue)?  </s>
<s> I'm sure the answer to the last question is core.  </s>
<s> I am not sure whether we intend for core to do the tranforms.  </s>
<s> The majority of the debate, though, is about whether core does Location resolution.  </s>
