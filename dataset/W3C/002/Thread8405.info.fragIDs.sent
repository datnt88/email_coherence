<s> I'm writing to ask about the "source" property which supposedly can be used to identify the URIs of multiple source documents.  </s>
<s> I've read a lot of the discussion in the list archive but I was still left slightly confused as to the status of this property.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I appear to be bringing up an old controversy and rehashing it ... I've only recently joined the list so I can find out about it.  </s>
<s> From what I read, the "source" property was a great idea but no-one ever implemented it, supposedly because it was too complicated and/or there was no perceived need.  </s>
<s> Eventually it was formally deprecated.  </s>
<s> Is this correct?  </s>
<s> I've also read of the "translate" header, which I gather is a Microsoft-specific extension?  </s>
<s> I also gather that this only supports a one-to-one mapping between a document and its source, i.e. a document has one and only one source?  </s>
<s> My case is that I have a server which generates pages from multiple sources and keeps track of those sources in such a way that it could fairly easily support dav:source.  </s>
<s> I'd like editors to be able to edit the page and select which of the source documents to edit.  </s>
<s> But are there existing clients that will actually do that?  </s>
<s> Or are there other web-dav mechanisms that might support my use-case?  </s>
<s> Currently I'm working on a system where, by adding a parameter to the URI of a page, the editor can access a page containing links to the source documents.  </s>
<s> Then they can select the source that interests them.  </s>
<s> I've also considered implementing this feature as an Annotea service, but I'd prefer to use just webdav if I thought there'd be client-side implementations that would use it.  </s>

<s> I'd characterize the reasons a little differently: 1) The feature was underspecified, there was never enough information in the spec to be able to fully implement or interoperate 2) Implementation interest was low -- we asked around to see who had implemented this feature and got no positive responses at all.  </s>
<s> The deprecation isn't final yet, but we are proposing to deprecate it.  </s>
<s> Yes  </s>
<s> Not that I know of.  </s>
<s> You'd be the first to implement a protocol feature to expose multiple mappings so nobody to interoperate with and no tools to support your feature.  </s>
<s> If there is sufficient interest from implementors to make forward progress on this, I'd recommend a separate draft rather than resurrect the unimplemented, underspecified, and untested feature in RFC2518.  </s>

<s> My perspective is a bit different.  </s>
<s> The DAV:source property was designed for exactly the situation that Conal describes.  </s>
<s> He'd like a generic application to pop up the list of URL's and say "these are the sources".  </s>
<s> There are no significant testing issues ... the format of the DAV:source property is well defined, and all a client is expected to do is to expose the specified list of URL's.  </s>
<s> So in Conal's case, I'd just expose this feature using the DAV:source property, and you are no worse off that if you just defined your own custom property, and that if enough folks do so, the property will become "undeprecated".  </s>
<s> Note: I am not arguing against deprecating the DAV:source feature ... I don't think the topic is significant enough to merit being re-opened ...  </s>
<s> I'm just saying that if you are an implementor and encounter a valid use for the DAV:source property, you should go ahead and use it instead of inventing your own custom property, even if it is deprecated in 2518bis.  </s>

<s> RFC2518 specifies a format that indeed doesn't make any sense (can you explain what the DAV:src sub-element is for?).  </s>
<s> So *if* this feature is to remain in RFC2518, at least the format needs to be fixed (possibly in a way backwards compatible to RFC2518).  </s>

<s> I don't think the format needs to be changed, but it certainly would need to be more clearly described.  </s>

<s> It does seem reasonable to use the source property today insofar as it can be used for simple cases.  </s>
<s> It's a good bet that when eventually enough implementors need the feature and work on the specification, they can likely reuse the same property name.  </s>
<s> However, the format within the property name could be significantly expanded.  </s>
<s> Here are some of my reasons already posted for believing the property is underspecified: Other minor and major reasons why the source property is underspecified: - Unlike other places where URLs appear in property values, URLs in the source property value are not shown in href tags.  </s>
<s> Was this intentional?  </s>
<s> - What do multiple 'link' elements mean semantically?  </s>
<s> - Can the URL in 'dst', in a given source property value, be the same URL that the source property appears on?  </s>
<s> Can it be different?  </s>
<s> - Is this property scalable?  </s>
<s> Sharemation's WebUI runs on hundreds of java files, with hundreds of java class files, a couple dozen java libraries, hundreds of text files including resource files, and dozens of images.  </s>
<s> Would the 'source' property for the URL /xythoswfs/webui on www.sharemation.com  </s>
<s> really contain over a thousand links plus information on how they tied together?  </s>
<s> Since some of these files can be changed without a recompile, would this property have to be dynamically calculated?  </s>
<s> By what process?  </s>
<s> To really handle this kind of situation, which isn't all that uncommon, the source property would have to point to some other authority or way to browse source files.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the source property could point to some directory hierarchy where the source files are all stored &amp; there would be more information within the properties of resources in that hierarchy.  </s>

<s> intentional?  </s>
<s> I assume so, but I doubt there was a good reason for it.  </s>
<s> The link elements have no semantics beyond stating that the specified DAV:dst resources are inputs to a process that creates the DAV:src resources.  </s>
<s> Extensions could provide more specific semantics, but this general property would be enough to allow human users to do interesting things with the information.  </s>
<s> Yes. What is not forbidden is allowed.  </s>
<s> One could certainly introduce scalability extensions, but there are many processes that only take a few resources as input and those would not require these scalability extensions.  </s>
