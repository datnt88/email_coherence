I've just seen the details for the new release of the W3C server - 
Jigsaw and spotted the details of the XML format and the administration 
protocol (http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/Doc/Programmer/JigXML.html). 
Is it 
just me or is this not in DAV format? 
Does this seem a bit strange? 
I'm generally just a snooper in the mailing list, but this confused me.

Its not the DAV format, but DAV could store the whole frame as a Jigsaw property. 
Wouldn't work that well for DASL though.

Jigsaw is not using DAV but a format that is more suited to a fast serialization/deserialization scheme. 
The fact that the admin protocol is using the same language is just legacy from the previous version and actually we are thinking about using it for the admin protocols. 
The 2.1 
track is meant to change with the possibility to do incompatible changes 
like upgrading the admin protocol ;) /\ - Yves Lafon - World Wide Web Consortium - /\ / \ Architecture Domain - Jigsaw Activity Leader / \ / \ http://www.w3.org/People/Lafon - ylafon@w3.org 
Ahh, I see. 
I assumed there was some reason for it, and performance is a good enough one! 
My first thoughts were that it seemed odd that you were implementing something similar, and maybe duplicating effort.
