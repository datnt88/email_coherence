All: 
Given the request for review and given that choreographies may be subject to something similar for location it is a good idea if we start the process of review and requirements gathering for this piece of work and then get back to them in a timely fashion.

I would invite a wider community to review our attempts.

mm1: Steve, these requirements should be generic as Reg/Rep also handles web services and had a Semantic Content Management subgroup. 
Suggest we distribute to both groups. 
Kathryn Breininger is the OASIS co-chair (kathryn.r.breininger@boeing.com) and Farrukh Najmi, the technical lead (farrukh.najmi@sun.com). 
Thanks.

Hi All, If location is going to be addressed within W3C choreography and OASIS UDDI, I believe that it would be wise to consult and liaise with both the OGC, Open GIS Consortium, whose Executive Director, Carl Reed, I am copying and the OASIS Emergency Management GIS Subcommittee, of which he is also the chair. 
I wholeheartedly recommend including ebXML Reg/Rep in exploring an inclusive harmonization of semantics wrt Web Services. 
As co-chair of the OASIS HumanMarkup TC, and a member of EM GIS SC, and WSRP TC respectively, I try to keep current with these work areas. 
I have also looked at the Requirement document and this looks a bit more complicated than necessary, especially for a requirements document. 
Also, I'm not sure a new rdf:Bag for extended metadata is required. 
If we are at the requirements gathering phase, then I would ask the inference engine makers what they need, unless that is what you all have already done. 
Of course, I also thought you were the inference engine makers, and the document appears to bely that assumption. 
Ciao, Rex
