<s> Hi Merlin, I have a problem to verify your signature.xml from  </s>
<s> merlin-iaikTests-two.tar.gz which was for testing exclusive c14n: The first Reference (digest input in c14n-0.xml)  </s>
<s> seems to be wrong.  </s>
<s> The others can be verified.  </s>
<s> It looks like this (indentation added by me): - c14n-0.xml ----------------------- Parent xml:foo="bar" xml:fool="barbar" xml:lang="en" xml:space="default" GrandChild xml:foo="barbarossa" xml:fool="barbar" xml:lang="ge" xml:space="preserve" /GrandChild This reference was simply the XPath transform (and implicit inclusive c14n omitting comments).  </s>
<s> What I see is that both the Parent and the GrandChild have a xml:fool="barbar" attribute while the GrandChild shouldn't.  </s>
<s> Regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Hi Christian, This is a feature of the c14n spec; see the second paragraph of 2.4: The processing of an element node E MUST be modified slightly when an XPath node-set is given as input and the element's parent is omitted from the node-set.  </s>
<s> The method for processing the attribute axis of an  </s>
<s> element E in the node-set is enhanced.  </s>
<s> All element nodes along E's ancestor axis are examined for nearest occurrences of attributes in the xml namespace, such as xml:lang and xml:space (whether or not they are in the node-set).  </s>
<s> From this list of attributes, remove any that are in E's attribute axis (whether or not they are in the node-set).  </s>
<s> Then, lexicographically merge this attribute list with the nodes of E's attribute axis that are in the node-set.  </s>
<s> The result of visiting the attribute axis is computed by processing the attribute nodes in this merged attribute list.  </s>
<s> This probably isn't aesthetically ideal; however, it doesn't cause any problems.  </s>

<s> Hi Christian,  </s>

<s> Hi Merlin, No, that can't be.  </s>
<s> That's strange.  </s>
<s> For instance, the exclusive c14n spec  </s>
<s> [1] tells me that subset c14n by selecting elem2 in this document n0:local xmlns:n0="foo:bar" xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org"  </s>
<s> n1:elem2 xmlns:n1="http://example.net" xml:lang="en" results in this: n1:elem2 xmlns:n0="foo:bar" xmlns:n1="http://example.net" xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org" xml:lang="en" Given the interpretation below, the xml:lang="en" would have to be also in the n3:stuff element.  </s>
<s> And it isn't.  </s>
<s> So I would (again) say that the first reference of merlin-iaikTests-two.tar.gz is wrong.  </s>

<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xml-exc-c14n --On Donnerstag, 23.  </s>
<s> Mai 2002 15:23 +0100 merlin merlin@baltimore.ie  </s>
<s> Right, I think this is the same bug (the spec is clear, just counter-intuitive so implemented incorrectly) I had to correct last month.  </s>
<s> [1] However, I also discovered a bug from Gregor's example 1 [a].  </s>
<s> Presently, c14n.py does the following: 1. takes any xml_attrs (e.g., xml:lang) from previous recursions not rendered and adds them to local xml_attrs.  </s>
<s> 2. if the element we are processing is in the subset, it renders the accumulated xml_attrs as part of that element and and resets xml_attrs=[] 3. it recurses.  </s>
<s> This has the effect of rendering all XML attributes that are "in affect" since the last ancestor was rendered.  </s>
<s> Sounds sensible, but it's not correct according to the the spec [b].  </s>
<s> To fix this, I think we'd have to test whether the immediate parent was in the nodeset and keep a dictionary (instead of a list) of *all* ancestors' xml:foo attributes (not just since the nearest rendered one), with the *nearest* value.  </s>
<s> (Moving from a list to a dictionary is akin to what I did for the namespace bug.) This bug exists in c14n, not exc-c14n.  </s>
<s> Hi Christian,  </s>
<s> I can't speak authoratitively to the specific test and example in Merlin's set, but on the c14n and exc-c14n front I can run the examples... xmlsec-python test_c14n.py  </s>
<s> -e -x "(//.  </s>
<s> | //@* | //namespace::*)[ancestor-or-self::n1:elem2]" -n "n1 http://example.net"  </s>
<s> -i foo.xml Normal c14n is: /xmlsec-python test_c14n.py  </s>
<s> -x "(//.  </s>
<s> | //@* | //namespace::*)[ancestor-or-self::n1:elem2]" -n "n1 http://example.net"  </s>
<s> -i foo.xml n1:elem2 xmlns:n0="foo:bar" xmlns:n1="http://example.net" xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org" xml:lang="en" xml:lang does not appear in n3 in either case.  </s>
<s> In the exc-c14n: you don't bother with any xml:foo attribute that aren't utilized in that immediate element in the source instance; in c14n you only look for ancestor xml:foo attributes if the immediate element's parent element is omitted from the selection.  </s>
<s> Have you tried interoping with Gregor's examples yet?  </s>
<s> He included a good test of this stuff.  </s>
<s> Hi Merlin, hi Joseph,  </s>
<s> I guess, NOW I got it.  </s>
<s> First of all, I can verify Merlin's signature now.  </s>
<s> Just to check that I understood it right: If I c14nize a document subset, I do only have to make this weird xml:* copying magic if the current element is an "orphan" node (to use this exclc14n lingo term), i.e. if the parent of the element is not in the document subset.  </s>
<s> If the parent of the current element IS in the document subset, I do NOT do the copying of all xml:* attrs, right?  </s>
<s> Joseph, please do not include the geuerp-iaikTests-one.zip from my former mail, it's wrong.  </s>
<s> I don't post a geuerp-iaikTests-two.zip because it does the same things which are in Merlins example.  </s>
<s> Christian --On Donnerstag, 23.  </s>
<s> Mai 2002 14:24 +0100 merlin merlin@baltimore.ie  </s>
<s> Yes, *and* when you do copy all the xml:* from the ancestors because of a missing parent element you go *all* the way up to the root, not just up to the next ancestor element in the subset.  </s>
<s> Counter-intuitive but the spec is clear once you get over your intuitions -- I had the same problem!  </s>
<s> [1] [1] http://mail.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/2002-April/007665.html  </s>
<s> First, here is my example on c14n and exclC14n.  </s>
<s> Maybe others can validate?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> (secret key for hmac is six octets of "secret").  </s>
<s> This weird behaviour of c14n of document subsets leads to a very strange result.  </s>
<s> Till today, my understanding of c14n was that given some input 'X', the c14n algorithm can be applied multiple times without changing the result.  </s>
<s> But now, I see that 1.) Given a document subset 'X' with a form that the above rule comes to play.  </s>
<s> 2.) Then we see that c14n(X) != c14n(c14n(x)) I included a sample for this (the last three references) in the interop.  </s>
<s> Regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Hi Christian, There are at least two problems I see with your c14n: Your c14n is: 1) Your XPath does not include any nodes from the namespace axis, so xmlns:ds="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" should not be emitted.  </s>
<s> You probably want an XPath of this form (I haven't thought much about it): count(ancestor-or-self::included) count(ancestor-or-self::notIncluded[1]/ancestor::included) This will include xml:lang="de" which you may or may not want; tweak as necessary.  </s>
<s> If you want a detailed discussion of the disconnect between the XPath info set concept of the namespace axis and DOM, look back at some of the threads from one or two years ago.  </s>
<s> I know I contributed my confusion to some of them.  </s>
<s> 2) xml:lang="de" is not defined in the ancestor axis of the first included element, and is not included in the node set, so should not be emitted.  </s>
<s> While I'm not convinced that there is a requirement that c14n(X) == c14n(c14n(X)) - c14n produces the canonical form of a node set, and the output of c14n is not the same node set as the input, so there is not a claim that the outputs should necessarily be the same - I think in fact that property may hold true.  </s>
<s> Can you send a clearer counterexample in-line, even just in pseudo XML?  </s>

<s> The only thing I've seen was something like this: Would it be possible that you create some obfuscated nodesets in a  </s>
<s> signature to have a good test vector?  </s>
<s> I mean canonicalizing a node set which omits xmlns:*, xmlns and xml:* attributes in both element which are part of the node set and elements which are not included in the node set.  </s>
<s> That would be VERY nice.  </s>
<s> In all other test vectors I use for unit testing and interop, I don't have such esoteric node sets.  </s>
<s> It's not that important, just an idea.  </s>
<s> If you take this fragment and you take all nodes but the notIncluded element into the node set: Then Canonical XML produces the following octet stream: If you canonicalize this octet stream again, you get  </s>
<s> That was what I wanted to express with "c14n(node set X) != c14n(c14n(node set X))" But I see that this is not only the case for the xml:* attributes but also leading and trailing whitespace which is outside the "new" document element after c14n.  </s>
<s> Hi Christian, r/geuer-pollmann@nue.et-inf.uni-siegen.de/2002.05.24/21:47:22  </s>
<s> That's probably one of the discussions..  </s>
<s> Sure, I'll try sending along something.  </s>
<s> That's not correct; repeated xml:* attributes are not suppressed, they are emitted at every element that defines them.  </s>
<s> Whitespace is probably the best example; other examples that (now) come to mind would be canonicalizing multiple disjoint elements, node sets that omit parts of the namespace axis, etc. Merlin  </s>
<s> Hi Merlin,  </s>
<s> Cool, thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> Sorry, even for (inclusive) c14n?  </s>
<s> I mean, the first c14n step takes a node set input and therefore must emit the xml:* attributes each time it the parent is not in the node set.  </s>
<s> But if the resulting octet stream from the 1st c14n is c14nized again, it is parsed into a node set, and this time, all nodes are in the document subset, so as far as I understood the processing, the 2nd xml:* attributes are omitted.  </s>
<s> Kind regards, Christian  </s>
