There's a whole bunch of things like "identification of choreography 
instance" that can usefully be defined just once and then used by everybody. 
I'd include in this the following additional information that needs to go in 
a (SOAP) message (there are probably more): 
1. Message Id - a unique id for a message 
2. RefToMessage Id - a way of identifying an earlier message to which this 
message relates - useful for identifying messages in error 
3. Conversation Id - which is really a choreography instance id as it 
identifies a set of related messages 
4. Creation Time - the time a message was initially created 
5. Expiry Time - the time after which the recipient of a SOAP message should 
no longer process it. 
These aren't new as ebXML Messaging identified them all several years ago - but only in a way that could be used with ebXML. 
I *totally* agree that these are not exclusively needed for Choreography and 
therefore we could perhaps ignore the problem, but nobody seems to be 
solving the problem either which means there is a severe risk that definitions for these things will be reinvented multiple times which does not make sense and could actually cause problems. 
For example what do you do if you have two different "creation times" for a message. 
How do you decide which to use? 
I've actually got a couple of specs that define the above as SOAP headers. 
Is anyone interested in taking them further ... to OASIS perhaps ... on a 
royalty free basis of course? 
David These are not new objectives. 
IMO the only issue is, some of the facilities you were talking about (e.g. identification of choreography instance) are not a standard part of WSDL nor of common message formats. 
So there's potentially a problem there. 
One possibility (I think this 
was suggested) is that we decide these are abstract properties and we basically defer the problem of realizing them at a concrete message level, which I could support. 
If you want to go in a different direction than this, then I need convincing.

I think we are actually agreed on two objectives: 1. 
The need to create choreography definitions that are indpendent of the message format, and 2. To define how choreography definitions are bound to Web Services and WSDL in particular. 
I don't think these objectives are mutually exclusive and we should be able to do both. 
Does anyone disagree?

+1 to defining how WS-Choreography binds to Web services. 
The Charter specifically says: "The language(s) should build upon 
the foundation of the WSDL 1.2". 
WSDL 1.2 defines interfaces and end points. 
If we don't at least 
define some precise mapping between WS-Choreography and WSDL interfaces, then I don't see in which  way we are building "upon the foundation of WSDL 1.2". 
[FAC] I believe we can do that without sacrificing broader applicability of the choreography. 
I'm more concerned that we not link the choreography to the message formats. 
If your concern is about about linking the choreography to the message formats on the wire, I would like to point out, as I have done before, that a portType/interface message structure does not imply any commitment to a format on the wire. 
It's only when the portType/interface is bound to a particular service that the wire format is defined.

You left out addressing (to/from/reply to/fault to). 
Yes, IMO these are 
fundamental facilities. 
They are really below choreography in the 
overall WS stack, although choreography is a user of them. 
Ideally you need them closely integrated with WSDL, because there are WSDL 
constructs such as MEPs that cannot be reasonably implemented without 
them (see related thread in WSA). 
But as to how best to make this happen, I am not sure.

Message Ids, and time information, although very useful may not be easy to 
define in an absolute manner. 
A requirement to have globally unique MsgIds 
is too restrictive to be acceptable, as some devices won't be able to 
generate them (and it puts restriction on choreographies using such Ids). 
I would be interested to see them, why not involve XMLP as well? 
Thanks,

Perhaps this is something that should be done by XMLP - I don't have a 
problem with that. 
However I think that the implementation of a solution 
that is using the choreography definition specification that this group will 
produce NEEDS information in the SOAP header such as Conversation Id, 
Message Id, etc. This, in turn, makes our spec dependent on the existence of such specs that we can reference in our own work. 
So I think this IS an issue for us which means that perhaps we should make 
it a formal liaison point/request with XMLP. 
Does this make sense?

This is of course assuming a certain solution. 
We should discus whether we would like a specific solution (e.g. message 
ids) or a generic correlation 
mechanism e.g like that found in BPEL, where any parts of a message header 
or body can be defined as the 
correlation "keys" for a particular choreography instance. 
Lets discuss the 
relative merits and requirements and then we can work out the appropriate actions and group(s) to talk to.

However, please leave the discussion of your corporate paper submittal to XMLP.
