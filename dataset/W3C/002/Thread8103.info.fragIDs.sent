<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I'm in the process of finishing my edits on the ordered collections draft  </s>
<s> ([1]).  </s>
<s> The main changes are clarifications, rewriting of marshalling sections DeltaV-style, and a new section on the relation between ordered collections and version-controlled collections.  </s>
<s> Feedback appreciated.  </s>
<s> BTW: is anybody except ourselves currently implementing this protocol extension?  </s>
