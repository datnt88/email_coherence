Guys, I started drafting a new version of the MT to reflect our staked-down decision that literals always denote themselves. 
This simplifies (and clarifies) the graph syntax and the basic MT, but it could be done in several different ways, so I wonder if anyone has any strong views on any of the following question: should we allow literals to entail bnodes ? 
At present, a graph entails its existential generalization which is gotten by 'erasing' urirefs into bnodes, eg ex:Jenny ex:age what:ever . 
|= ex:Jenny ex:age _:x . 
Do we want this to be true for literals as well? 
Eg should this be a valid inference? 
ex:Judy ex:age "10" . 
|= ex:Judy ex:age _:x . 
It seems to me that we should do this, since there is no doubt that literals do denote something - themselves, in fact - in any interpretation. 
This means that the following inference would be valid, for example: 
ex:Jenny ex:age "10" . 
|= ex:Jenny ex:age _:y . 
which might seem a bit worrying if there was an rdfs:drange assertion around, eg ex:age rdfs:drange xsd:number 
which imposes the 'lexical' datatype in the first case, but looks like it might impose the 'value' in the second case; but in fact it is OK, since that conclusion would only trigger the value datatyping constraint if the bnode were also the subject of rdfs:dlex; and that in turn would require the original graph to have had something like this in it: ex:Jenny ex:age "10" . 
"10" rdfs:dlex "12" . 
which is so crazy that no-one should be surprised if it has crazy 
entailments, right? 
Anyway, if y'all agree that we should accept this inference, then I think the simplest way to re-do the MT is to simply say up-front that *all* RDF interpretations must include *all* literals in their universe. 
Then we can just say that for literals E, I(E) = E, and not 
talk about things like LV and XL at all. 
Does anyone have any philosophical objections to this? 
It would allow quite a few of the lemmas to be stated with fewer qualifications, and the proofs to be simplified.

yes. 
It is in our "swap" software. 
I can make test cases if anybody likes. 
right. 
yup; that seems straightforward.

as is in our stuff i.e. ( http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/p13.nt ) log:entails http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/p14.nt . 
indeed, assuming that rdfs:drange only imposes datatype checking on literals 
I fully agree 
no objection, just praise

Absolute agreement. 
I sent something like this to the list ages ago: see which demonstrates how you can do tidy literals and support XSD datatypes - (and you'd probably implement it using something akin to jena's pair mechanism).

Good to be thinking about this and collecting data. 
A couple of suggestions: o don't do too much work on it till we datatypes fully nailed; some issues did surface at the f2f. 
I'm afraid they are not done yet :( o great to ask such clear questions, but best to wait for a collective group decision before implementing them Brian

Yes, I don't see the need to protect people from themselves here. 
MT simplicity is a good thing.
