<s> engine.  </s>
<s> Such an assertion does not constitute a definition of a datatype.  </s>
<s> There is no way to define a datatype in RDFS.  </s>
<s> Datatypes are defined externally to RDFS. 2. In order to be useful, some information about a datatype needs to be provided to a datatype-savvy RDF engine.  </s>
<s> The information is of various kinds, and some datatypes may provide only part of the information.  </s>
<s> Insofar as information about the datatype is unavailable, a datatype-savvy RDF engine will be able to draw only the same conclusions as a non-datatype-savvy RDF engine.  </s>
<s> Or, if you like, stated semantically, datatype entailment is defined relative to the information provided by the datatype information source.  </s>
<s> If you get more information, you can make more inferences; if you get none, then the datatype adds nothing and you are just doing RDFS.  </s>
<s> That way, RDFS entailment is like datatype entailment with an empty-information datatype.  </s>
<s> 3a. The minimal kind of information is a specification of which literals are syntactically correct, ie in the lexical space of the datatype, and which are not.  </s>
<s> This information being unobtainable for a resource which is asserted to be in the class rdfs:Datatype may be considered an error condition.  </s>
<s> 3b.  </s>
<s> The second kind of information is a specification of which literals map to the same value in the datatype.  </s>
<s> This information can be conceptualized as a set of equations between typed literals with the same type: "aaa"^^ddd = "bbb"^^ddd .  </s>
<s> but it may also be provided, for example, by giving a mapping from lexical forms to canonical lexical forms.  </s>
<s> 3c. The third kind of information is like 3b, but specifies identities between forms under different datatypes:  </s>
<s> "aaa"^^ddd = "bbb"^^eee .  </s>
<s> This may be provided, for example, by giving schematic mappings between canonical lexical forms of the different datatypes under various boundary conditions.  </s>
<s> 3d. The fourth kind of information is subset relationships between value spaces of different datatypes.  </s>

<s> To me it suggests that a value space is optional and that a datatype can define only a lexical space and a canonical lexical space; and that is not correct.  </s>
<s> It may be the case that "9" and "10" are canonical lexical forms for xsd:integer, but these canonical forms are not members of the value space, and e.g. ordered comparision of lexical forms is not the same as ordered comparision of values -- i.e. 9  10 but "10"  "9".  </s>
<s> We do not define nor care about canonical lexical forms in RDF datatyping.  </s>
<s> Again, we need to speak in terms of values, not canonical lexical forms.  </s>
