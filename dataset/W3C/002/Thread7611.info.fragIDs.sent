We are working on a WebDAV server implementation, and have been testing it using MS WebFolders and cadaver, but I haven't seen either of these use 'PROPPATCH' for anything interesting. 
Does anyone know of a client that makes use of PROPPATCH? 
We are doing a project on WebDAV client program. 
We are using HTTPClient lib, use ExtensionMethod method, pass "PROPFIND" as param. 
We have a project home page at: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~posties1

The tdav.py client uses PROPPATCH, but only for testing servers. 
By the way when you get your server up, let me know, and I will test it for compliance.
