As mentioned in a previous post, now is the time to start resolving issues 
on the RFC 2518 issues list. 
As fate would have it, the first issue on the list is one that has been contentious in the past. 
Can we come to consensus on it now? 
Issue: PROP_ATTR Description: What is a WebDAV server required to do with XML attributes other than 
xml:lang submitted with a PROPPATCH? 
This affects how well WebDAV will be 
able to support RDF, since RDF uses attributes extensively. 
Greg Stein originally raised this issue: 
See also: 
Jim: Thanks for getting the issues list started. 
I believe that WebDAV must permit properties to have attributes. 
As you've pointed out, RDF and PRISM do use them extensively. 
A server can reformat 
the attributes in a subsequent PROPFIND request. 
Attrbiutes should be persistent. 
Thanks, Mark 
I agree. 
There is no reason not to persist attributes. 
I agree here. 
Maybe the way property values are round-tripped needs to be defined in terms of the XML infoset [1] or the Canonical XML rec [2]. 
If a server supports "arbitrary" content of properties (like child elements with attribute, mixed content and so on), it will have to store the content in some XML friendly format anyway. 
Instead of storing the "value" of the property (all contained elements?), it can instead store the element (with all it's attributes and childs), thus preserving all attribute information.

The question isn't about attributes in general, it is about *which* attributes. 
Consider the following: thevalue I believe everybody would agree that attr2 gets stored. 
The real question is about attr1. 
I see that attribute as part of the element that *names* a property, but it isn't part of the property *value*. 
IMO, PROP_ATTR is about defining the boundary between property naming, and a property's value.

I agree with Greg et all that "attr2" needs to be stored. 
I believe that allowing "attr1" could lead to some interop problems, or we need to spec this out a little better: Is that legal? 
Does the attribute make the property unique? 
Does simply 
the value of an attribute make it unique? 
Or do we (like xmllang) simply store one set of attributes for a property? 
Also how does one use Dasl with attributes on properties? 
I would like to see attributes on the property name not be supported.

No, it doesn't. 
If the language in section 4.5 ( http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.4.5 ) isn't clear enough on that, it should be enhanced. 
Who does? 
RFC2518 says that xml:lang must be preserved, but it doesn't say that there may be multiple copies of the property with different language values ( http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#ELEMENT_set ). 
I might agree, but not for the reasons given here.
