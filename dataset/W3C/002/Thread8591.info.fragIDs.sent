<s> The code Type /code attribute, as in Section 4.3.3, is a URI consisting of "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#" suffixed with a code KeyInfo /code sub-element type, such as "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#X509Data".  </s>

<s> How can the verifier locate the keying info referred to by the RetrievalMethod, if the URI attribute is missing?  </s>
<s> The syntax allows such a case, since the attribute is declared optional.  </s>

<s> Hummm, perhaps I copied Reference a bit too blindly...  </s>
<s> You could have a case where the location of the keying material was implied by the application, but in that case, there is really no reason to bother with a RetrievalMethod element at all...  </s>
<s> We can talk about this on today's teleconference.  </s>
