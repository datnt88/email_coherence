<s> Dear Folks,  </s>
<s> A user reported to me that Tidy was incorrectly reporting a missing table summary for HTML 3.2 documents.  </s>
<s> I did some investigation, and reproduced the problem with both the 04 Aug 00 Mac OS and Windows versions of Tidy.  </s>
<s> Sample HTML :  </s>
<s> Missing table summary only applies to HTML 4.x Running this through Tidy gives : Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing console input (stdin) line 7 column 1 - Warning: table lacks "summary" attribute stdin: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN" stdin: Document content looks like HTML 3.2 1 warnings/errors were found!  </s>
<s> I looked at the Tidy code, and saw the following pieces : attrs.c  </s>
<s> : {"summary", VERS_HTML40, TEXT}, /* TABLE */ /* suppress warning for missing summary for HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2 */ if (!HasSummary &amp;&amp; lexer- doctype != VERS_HTML20 &amp;&amp; lexer- doctype != VERS_HTML32) lexer- badAccess |= MISSING_SUMMARY; ReportAttrError(lexer, node, "summary", MISSING_ATTRIBUTE); lexer.c  </s>
<s> : {"HTML 3.2", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32}, /* compute length of identifier e.g. "HTML 2.0" */ for (j = i + 14; j  doctype- end &amp;&amp; lexer- lexbuf[j] != '/'; ++j); len = j - i - 14; s = W3C_Version[0].name;  </s>
<s> if (len == wstrlen(s) &amp;&amp; wstrncmp(p, s, len) == 0) return W3C_Version[0].code;  </s>
<s> /* make a note of the version named by the doctype */ lexer- doctype = FindGivenVersion(lexer, lexer- token); Basically what happens is that FindGivenVersion() in lexer.c  </s>
<s> sets lexer- doctype to VERS_UNKNOWN, rather than VERS_HTML32, because the wstrncmp() fails to match "HTML 3.2 Final" to "HTML 3.2".  </s>
<s> But ironically ApparentVersion() in lexer.c  </s>
<s> figures out (from lexer- versions) that it is dealing with HTML 3.2 code.  </s>
<s> According to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32 , the doctype for HTML 3.2 should be specified as shown in the sample.  </s>
<s> If I however change the sample HTML doctype to be : this causes the incorrect table summary problem to go away.  </s>
<s> I see a couple of choices to fix this (and other potential HTML 3.2 problems) : 1) Change the string constant in lexer.c  </s>
<s> from : {"HTML 3.2", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32}, to : {"HTML 3.2 Final", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32}, 2) Change FindGivenVersion() in lexer.c  </s>
<s> from : s = W3C_Version[0].name;  </s>
<s> if (len == wstrlen(s) &amp;&amp; wstrncmp(p, s, len) == 0) return W3C_Version[0].code; to something like : s = W3C_Version[0].name;  </s>
<s> if (wstrncmp(p, s, wstrlen(s)) == 0) return W3C_Version[0].code;  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I'm using JTidy as a parser, and I have a problem with the following code: Tidy generates : Is it a bug or is it a consequence of bad HTML writting ??  </s>
<s> I have search in the list something like this problem and I found "Bug: Nested anchor elements allowed" but the patch is in C, what about the Java code, especially the DescendantOf function ?  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>
<s> Denis Queffeulou  </s>
<s> It's a consequence of bad HTML writing: a elements can only have inline contents, but h3 is block-level.  </s>
<s> When Tidy gets to the h3 start tag, it assumes missing /a and /p end tags to get back to block level, then deletes the empty elements formed.  </s>
<s> After the heading it ignores the extra /a .  </s>
<s> It could also be considered a bug, as it should be obvious to Tidy that you meant:  </s>
<s> That isn't related to this.  </s>
<s> hope this helps, Daniel Biddle deltab@osian.net  </s>
