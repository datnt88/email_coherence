<s> Some issues that arose: - I conveyed the group's desire to receive sponsorship from both the W3C and the IETF.  </s>

<s> The benefit from W3C sponsorship would be to receive greater review and exposure in the Web community.  </s>
<s> Documents would be initially prepared according to IETF guidelines, then mirrored to the W3C.  </s>
<s> There was some concern that being a W3C working group would mean that working group documents could be kept hidden, which is contrary to the spirit and rules of the IETF.  </s>
<s> I reaffirmed our position that the WEBDAV working group is open, producing open intermediate and final documents, and that this would not change under W3C sponsorship.  </s>
<s> I'm somewhat surprised by this idea.  </s>
<s> Firstly, is it really the group's desire  </s>
<s> to be sponsored by W3C?  </s>
<s> I've seen no opinions expressed either way.  </s>
<s> Secondly,  </s>
<s> is the Web not part of the Internet?  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that W3C members do not take IETF standards to be definitive?  </s>
<s> I'd also suggest that since W3C operates in a way which is contrary to the IETF's practices, that it is not necessarily in the IETF's best interests to endorse W3C in this way.  </s>

<s> At the IETF meeting, on Tuesday, December 10, 1996, I had the opportunity to have lunch with the IETF Application Area Directors, Harald Alvestrand, and Keith Moore.  </s>
<s> Also in attendance at this lunch were Larry Masinter, and Del Jensen.  </s>
<s> When we weren't fighting the noise from planes (from the nearby San Jose airport), trains (we were eating at a cafe right next to the San Jose Light Rail tracks), and automobiles (the cafe was also right on the street), we discussed whether the IETF should have a working group considering Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning issues.  </s>
<s> The impression I received was that our draft charter was well received, and managed to avoid several common draft charter pitfalls.  </s>
<s> Both Keith and Harald liked the idea of working on distributed authoring and versioning technology.  </s>
<s> Some issues that arose:  </s>

<s> I reaffirmed our position that the WEBDAV working group is open, producing open intermediate and final documents, and that this would not change under W3C sponsorship.  </s>
<s> - There was some concern over having me listed as an author on the DAV protocol specification, due to my need to claim academic credit for the activity.  </s>
<s> Since I would not be the editor of the document, I received the impression that this might be workable (but that Keith and Harald would need to look into this).  </s>
<s> At the lunch we discussed a roadmap for what comes next: - At the WEBDAV BOF, a vote would be taken to determine whether the participants of the BOF felt the IETF should pursue work in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning.  </s>
<s> - If the vote was positive, then Harald and Keith would review the draft charter, and return their comments to me.  </s>
<s> - After iterating the charter until it is satisfactory with Harald and Keith, it will be submitted to the IESG for final approval.  </s>

<s> The opinion of the group, as expressed at the Palo Alto meeting, was that we should pursue joint sponsorship by the IETF and the W3C.  </s>
<s> This was written in the minutes from the Palo Alto meeting (Day 2, 2nd paragraph).  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I can't find these minutes, but my records are far from perfect.  </s>
<s> Was this meeting a W3C meeting, by any chance?  </s>
<s> I notice that the recent meeting seems only to have been asked about IETF sponsorship.  </s>
<s> No. If you received this impression, then it is due to a deficiency in my communication to the mailing list.  </s>
<s> How did you receive this impression?  </s>
<s> I don't know.  </s>
<s> I suppose its because W3C doesn't tell me what its up to, which makes me sceptical about its dedication to open standards, combined with my surprise that joint sponsorship was contemplated.  </s>
<s> I view sponsorship of the DAV activity as endorsement of the goal of developing a standard way to perform remote authoring and versioning of Web content, rather than any statement about the IETF endorsing the W3C, or vice-versa.  </s>
<s> That may be the way you view it, and very possibly the way I view it, too.  </s>
<s> But is it the way the world views it?  </s>
<s> Furthermore, I am not convinced that W3C adds any value to the IETF process.  </s>
