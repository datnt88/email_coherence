Hi Joseph, just wanted to let you know that "Apache" now successfully verifies - Y1 - Y2 - Y3 - Y4 (new) Kind regards, Christian 
Joseph, 
one thing. 
When I wrote all this c14n code, my limited brain had a hard work. 
In order to allow other people to have a little easier job, I've included a ZIP with html files for the interop page. 
The HTML files are similar to the c14n-x.txt 
files from the test vectors (Y1..Y4), but they highlight the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n. 
There exist four different styles to indicate how a given node is treated. 
(1) A node which is in the node set is labeled using the INCLUDED style. 
(2) A node which is NOT in the node set is labeled EXCLUDED style. 
(3) A namespace which is in the node set AND in the 
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the 
INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style. 
(4) A namespace which is in NOT the node set AND in the InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style. 
If you could add it to the interop page? 
Christian (Sorry for this big attachment) 
Thanks Christian, now linked from the page. 
One question though: "highlight 
the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n." 
You examples are of the output though, right -- not the input? 
The actual 
document says "Output" and the explaination says, "nodeset of the given Reference before it is canonicalized" but you have a computed SignatureValue? 
So I'm not sure what exact stage the output represents. 
Imagine you have this: In that case, document and someData are highlighted in white as they are included in the node set while ds:Signature and the descendants are grey (as they are not in the node set). 
The HTML displays the full document (including comments and all that stuff), but only the result of subsequent node set operations (before the set is converted to octets) is highlighted.
