<s> Hi Joseph, just wanted to let you know that "Apache" now successfully verifies - Y1 - Y2 - Y3 - Y4 (new) Kind regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Joseph,  </s>
<s> one thing.  </s>
<s> When I wrote all this c14n code, my limited brain had a hard work.  </s>
<s> In order to allow other people to have a little easier job, I've included a ZIP with html files for the interop page.  </s>
<s> The HTML files are similar to the c14n-x.txt  </s>
<s> files from the test vectors (Y1..Y4), but they highlight the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n.  </s>
<s> There exist four different styles to indicate how a given node is treated.  </s>
<s> (1) A node which is in the node set is labeled using the INCLUDED style.  </s>
<s> (2) A node which is NOT in the node set is labeled EXCLUDED style.  </s>
<s> (3) A namespace which is in the node set AND in the  </s>
<s> InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the  </s>
<s> INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style.  </s>
<s> (4) A namespace which is in NOT the node set AND in the InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style.  </s>
<s> If you could add it to the interop page?  </s>
<s> Christian (Sorry for this big attachment)  </s>
<s> Thanks Christian, now linked from the page.  </s>
<s> One question though: "highlight  </s>
<s> the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n."  </s>
<s> You examples are of the output though, right -- not the input?  </s>
<s> The actual  </s>
<s> document says "Output" and the explaination says, "nodeset of the given Reference before it is canonicalized" but you have a computed SignatureValue?  </s>
<s> So I'm not sure what exact stage the output represents.  </s>
<s> Imagine you have this: In that case, document and someData are highlighted in white as they are included in the node set while ds:Signature and the descendants are grey (as they are not in the node set).  </s>
<s> The HTML displays the full document (including comments and all that stuff), but only the result of subsequent node set operations (before the set is converted to octets) is highlighted.  </s>
<s> Christian  </s>
