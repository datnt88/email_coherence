In the versioning protocol, it is very important to give a client the ability to update an existing resource via a COPY. 
Unfortunately, 2518 currently says that a COPY with Overwrite:T MUST delete the destination resource first, which means you are not updating the resource, but rather are creating a new resource. 
For versioning, this means that a COPY whose Destination is a version-controlled resource creates a new non-version-controlled resource at the Destination, rather than adding a new version to the version history of the version-controlled resource. 
This "delete" behavior has similar bad interactions with access control, since someone that is allowed to update a resource, but not allowed to delete that resource, would not be allowed to execute the COPY. 
In earlier versions of the versioning protocol, a new value, "update" was proposed for the Overwrite header (in addition to "T" and "F"), to support this update behavior of COPY. 
Alternatively, one could introduce an "Update" header. 
A third alternative was suggested at the recent IETF meeting by Roy Fielding, namely, that the "update" behavior was actually the behavior intended for COPY with Overwrite:T, so the 
right thing to do is to make this clarification in the versioning protocol, rather than introducing a new "update" value for Overwrite or a new Update header. 
The consensus of the attendees of the WebDAV working group meeting was to follow Roy's suggestion, and use this third alternative, so this is what now appears in the latest versioning draft (10.11). 
Does anyone object to this third alternative? 
In particular, note that this does result in different behavior when a collection is being copied. 
In particular, the "delete" semantics removes members that are currently in the destination but do not have corresponding members in the source, while the "update" semantics does not remove any members, but only updates existing members and adds new members. 
Note: Please comment on this soon, since the current plan is to submit the versioning protocol to the IESG in January.

Should this be in the versioning protocol, or in an update to 2518?

(Or is it intended that the versioning RFC update 2518?) This is something that is needed by the versioning protocol, but which is of sufficient generality as to be a reasonable candidate for inclusion in an update to 2518. 
So it MUST appear in the versioning protocol (since we don't want to delay the versioning protocol until an update to 2518 is completed), and they SHOULD appear in the update to 2518.

I've always viewed it this way, and consider the whole "DELETE first" thing to be awfully pedantic. 
Not me. 
Not at all. 
If I want directory DA to overwrite directory DB, then the result should look like directory DA. 
That means deleting the stuff that wasn't in DA. 
And to throw back some of your semantics :-) ... DA is a set of bindings. 
That set overwrites the set in DB. Bang! 
There goes the spurious stuff that was in DB. Theoretically, you don't even have to copy resources... just adjust the bindings to the resources. 
:-) [ yes, I tend to avoid the whole "directories are sets of bindings" view because it is a rather awkward viewpoint sometimes. 
but it is oh-so-fun to throw that back at people when they suggest a semantic that is non-intuitive :-) ] Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/

That would be fine with me. 
I'll make that change if nobody objects (it has the *major* benefit that it then is virtually identical to what 2518 says today, except you don't delete unless you have to). 
And to throw back some of your semantics :-) ... Oh, please don't toss me into that briar patch Brer Fox! (:-) DA is a set of bindings.
