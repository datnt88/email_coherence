<s> On such issues I find Dave Beckett's reference[1] a helpful resource, especially the "Has defined meaning as an Element" and "Has defined meaning as ab Attribute" sections.  </s>
<s> I'm tempted to declare everything that falls out of context illegal, if only so that we have extreme clarity on what an RDF document is.  </s>
<s> While this is an extra burden on implementers, I think it is a worthwhile one.  </s>
<s> The alternative seems to be confusion and problems with interoperability.  </s>

<s> Illegal.  </s>
<s> rdf:Description rdf:Description foo /rdf:Description /rdf:Description  </s>
<s> Illegal.  </s>
<s> rdf:Description rdf:Bag foobar /rdf:Bag /rdf:Description  </s>
<s> Well-formed document, but may not meet higher-level constraints.  </s>
<s> _:anon rdf:Bag "foobar" .  </s>
<s> rdf:Description rdf:aboutEachPrefix="foo"/ foo:bar foobar /foo:bar /rdf:Description  </s>
<s> As far as I know, use of aboutEachPrefix is illegal.  </s>
<s> Well-formed document, but may not meet higher-level constraints.  </s>
<s> _:anon rdf:type rdf:_1 .  </s>
<s> _:anon foo:bar "foobar" .  </s>
<s> If my resolutions seem weird, it is because I see a difference between strictly syntactical items in the RDF namespace, and those which appear in the model.  </s>
<s> (Syntactical items are illegal when found out of place, model items are not.)  </s>
<s> I wish these two groups were separated better (i.e. model ones in the schema namespace) but I don't think it would be a good idea to modify namespaces now.  </s>
<s> However, I do ask that in drafts we put together, the difference between these two groups is clear.  </s>

<s> [... (Brian's full message below)] I think we should be wary about going down the road of specifying an interpretation for non-valid RDF syntax.  </s>
<s> Thus, I think the main issue here is to decide whether or not they are reasonably treated as valid RDF.  </s>
<s> I have a concern about rdf:Description used as a property: it's not clear to me that the URI corresponding to rdf:Description should be interpreted as a class, so it's appearance in would be a syntactic way of saying "there is a resource of unknown type...".  </s>
<s> Consider: and When RDF schema is taken into account, I think these both say the same thing, and in particular that the resource "http://example.org/res" has an rdf:type of rdfs:Resource.  </s>
<s> (I thought the "equivalence" of rdf:Description and rdfs:Resource had been noted as an issue, but I don't see it.  </s>
<s> See also: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Jan/0009.html)  </s>
<s> In the case of rdf:Bag, I don't know if we need to forbid anyone treating it as a property, though it doesn't seem to be an immediately helpful idea.  </s>
