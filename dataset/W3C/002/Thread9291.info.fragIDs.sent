Jeremy Carroll in has raised some test cases we ought to clarify: 
Also, he is questioning our resolution of: 
These are basically about what to do with names that are 'recognised' as being part of the RDF namespace but appear out of context. 
I'll add this as a new issue to the list. 
We probably ought to try to 
give it some attention as it has been raised on rdf-interest.

On such issues I find Dave Beckett's reference[1] a helpful resource, especially the "Has defined meaning as an Element" and "Has defined meaning as ab Attribute" sections. 
I'm tempted to declare everything that falls out of context illegal, if only so that we have extreme clarity on what an RDF document is. 
While this is an extra burden on implementers, I think it is a worthwhile one. 
The alternative seems to be confusion and problems with interoperability.

Oh, and to get my positions on these issues on the record: 
rdf:Description rdf:Description="foo"/ 
Illegal. 
rdf:Description rdf:Description foo /rdf:Description /rdf:Description 
Illegal. 
rdf:Description rdf:Bag foobar /rdf:Bag /rdf:Description 
Well-formed document, but may not meet higher-level constraints. 
_:anon rdf:Bag "foobar" . 
rdf:Description rdf:aboutEachPrefix="foo"/ foo:bar foobar /foo:bar /rdf:Description 
As far as I know, use of aboutEachPrefix is illegal. 
Well-formed document, but may not meet higher-level constraints. 
_:anon rdf:type rdf:_1 . 
_:anon foo:bar "foobar" . 
If my resolutions seem weird, it is because I see a difference between strictly syntactical items in the RDF namespace, and those which appear in the model. 
(Syntactical items are illegal when found out of place, model items are not.) 
I wish these two groups were separated better (i.e. model ones in the schema namespace) but I don't think it would be a good idea to modify namespaces now. 
However, I do ask that in drafts we put together, the difference between these two groups is clear.

[... (Brian's full message below)] I think we should be wary about going down the road of specifying an interpretation for non-valid RDF syntax. 
Thus, I think the main issue here is to decide whether or not they are reasonably treated as valid RDF. 
I have a concern about rdf:Description used as a property: it's not clear to me that the URI corresponding to rdf:Description should be interpreted as a class, so it's appearance in would be a syntactic way of saying "there is a resource of unknown type...". 
Consider: and When RDF schema is taken into account, I think these both say the same thing, and in particular that the resource "http://example.org/res" has an rdf:type of rdfs:Resource. 
(I thought the "equivalence" of rdf:Description and rdfs:Resource had been noted as an issue, but I don't see it. 
See also: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Jan/0009.html) 
In the case of rdf:Bag, I don't know if we need to forbid anyone treating it as a property, though it doesn't seem to be an immediately helpful idea.
