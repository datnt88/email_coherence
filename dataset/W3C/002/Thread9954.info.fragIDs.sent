A preliminary agenda for the f2f is now on the web page.

Brian, 
Would you (or anyone else) be able to provide the precise GPS coordinates for HP Labs for those of us driving there? 
Thanks, 
Patrick 
In Hawaii, I asked Jeremy to locate HP Labs on a fairly detailed Garmin European MetroGuide map downloadable into my eTrex Vista GPS. 
The results were N51.50399 W2.54990 I'll take my own reading when I get there :-). 
Mike 
Great. Thanks. 
Patrick 
It'll be interesting to know how successful you are in finding HP from GPS coordinates - you should be warned that Bristol roads don't always work like that.

Oh yeah. 
Well, at least it keeps me from driving 20 miles in the wrong direction. 
I might not know how best to get to point X, but at least I'll know where it is. 
If I don't show up around 10:30 on the 17th, I've probably fallen victim to the Bristol roads ;-) 
Ouch! Cutting, but then as they say, "the truth hurts" Patrick
