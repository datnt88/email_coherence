Hello, 
I have been using the tidy tool for about two months now, and I have stumbled across a behavior that I do not understand. 
In the case of the following markup: Some Text /i /p /td tidy generates this: Please note the "_c1" which has been appended to the existing class name "centBoldWhite". 
This refers to a new style definition which tidy creates as follows: p.c1 {font-style: italic} 
It appears to me that tidy is trying to append the contents of the new class "c1" onto the existing class "centBoldWhite". 
While this seems like a very useful thing to be able to do, neither IE nor Netscape wil actually render the new "centBoldWhite_c1" construct. 
Is this an error, or is the "_" really supposed to join classes? 
If an error, how does one assign multiple classes to an element? 
If it is supposed to work, can you suggest an explanation for why it doesn't work for me? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Regards, Glen Browning. 
Hi Glen, 
The underscore in class="centBoldWhite_c1" is not meant to join two classes ('centBoldWhite' and 'c1'); it is a new class. 
Can you check that there are 
no other elements with class="c1" in the Tidy output? 
It's these elements 
that are affected by the new style definition generated by Tidy. 
I would also like to mention that it is better to avoid underscores in ID and CLASS values, even though they are permitted: see Eric Meyer's note on Netscape Devedge: http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2001/css-underscores/.

It is certainly better to avoid underscores in ID-type attributes, as they are, according to SGML standards, NAME tokens. 
A NAME attribute has the following characteristics : Case-insensitive Max length : NAMELEN (see in the SGML declaration) First character: A..Z Subsequent characters: A..Z, 0..9, period, hyphen So, underscores are *not*allowed* in ID attributes. 
class being usually a CDATA, there are no syntactical constraints, be a bit discipline canb't be a trouble.

That's a bug, it's fixed in CVS since mid April I think. 
I suggest you upgrade your Tidy binaries. 
Why do you think so? 
Hi Bjoern, Let me reformulate what I meant. 
When Tidy turns this: Some Text /i /p /td into this: and adds p.c1 {font-style: italic} then the style rules p.c1 {...} p.centBoldWhite {...} p.c1.centBoldWhite {...} don't apply to p class="centBoldWhite_c1" ... (You would need p.centBoldWhite_c1 {...}.) But each of the three rules would apply to Best regards, Christophe
