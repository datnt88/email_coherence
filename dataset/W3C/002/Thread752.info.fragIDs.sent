I've got a HTML that contains a body tag very long: When I apply tidy to this, the tag is deleted. 
Why? 
I'm using the following options: -asxml -wrap 0 -m filename.htm

I cannot reproduce this problem on tidy4aug00 (linux, default settings). 
The body tag is left untouched (except that the attribute names are converted to lowercase). 
However, I suggest that (instead of using Macromedia Dreamweaver's built-in junk) you write a little external JavaScript ( SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript" TYPE="text/javascript" SRC="preload.js" ). 
No matter what problem your version of Tidy has with this piece of HTML, this would be the cleaner solution anyway.
