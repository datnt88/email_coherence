<s> One problem with the current idea of relative references: the notes say, "If reftarget is relative, the client has the burden of figuring out the value of the absolute URL.".  </s>
<s> This sounds fine--clients already have code for relative URLs--but it won't work, because a 302's Location: header is required to provide an absolute URI (see RFC-2068, section 14.30).  </s>

<s> I'd say that the Right Thing to do for expanding relative references is to base them off of the Request-URI of the request you're currently processing.  </s>
<s> This shouldn't be too hard: for the spec, point to RFC-1808 (with a note that the "base document" is the reference itself); for the implementation, lift some code from lynx or Mozilla or something.  </s>
