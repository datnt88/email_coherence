Is anyone aware of a utility to remove the content from a web page. 
We are converting a large amount of content from an existing web site to a CM system. 
In the past my company has always done this manually by copying the site content from a rendered page and copying to a txt editor like Notepad (thereby stripping all the HTML) and then copying into the CM editor. 
We have the ability to load the information into the app if the content is loaded as text. 
Is anyone aware of a tool that can spider through a site and create multipletext files.... 
I highly recomend a tool called "Search and Rreplace" by Funduc software. 
You could easily write a script that would grab all the text between " " and " ". you could further customize it to suit your needs. 
I have successfully used to to strip out all the Word XP proprietary tags and such, while leaving the text formatting like bold and italics. 
here is a link to the company's site: peace, dude

If you install Lynx, you can easily run the page through Lynx and let it output a nicely formatted text file - but without support for tables. 
My favorite text editor NoteTab also has a good 'convert to text' function, and can be scripted to run through a complete directory of HTML files on your hard disk. 
Tidy however can not do this, so it is rather off-topic for this list.
