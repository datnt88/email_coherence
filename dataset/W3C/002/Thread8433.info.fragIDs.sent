We have intellectual property rights which may be related to the signing of 
HTML and XML documents. 
These are embodied in two patent applications filed 
in the current year and possibly other future patents. 
It is our intention to license any aspects of these patents relevant to the 
work of the digital signature group to W3C members and members of the XML digital signature group under fair, nominal and non-discriminatory terms. 
We will disclose the filed patents after we have finished amending the claims. 
We expect that any future patents derived from technology developed or 
currently planned will either not affect the XML signature group effort, or 
have only a complimentary effect.

Hi Scott, You may want to review your patent applications against what is currently being done in XFDL. 
UWI would also be happy to have a look at them. 
We 
have been selling systems that digitally sign XML documents since at least 
January 1998, and we have dated technical specifications dated back to 4Q97 
and perhaps even 3Q97 (I'd have to check our archives). 
Hence if such a 
patent were awarded, then UWI would most likely be in a position to dispute 
the patent using UFDL and XFDL as "Prior Art". 
Perhaps you could be more specific about what is claimed... John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company [mailto:w3c-ietf-xmldsig-request@w3.org]On

Virtually all of the timestamping patents are key here as well - and will 
likely blow some of the document signing patents that have been recently applied for, cleanly out of the water.

Here is the result of a small side conversation. 
I don't think this will ever really be an issue but I thought the best possible was to error on the side of caution. 
I agree with Joseph's suggestion that addition questions might be best directed to me off the email list and only brought back into the general discussion if something comes up which turns out to be relevant to the working group.
