<s> Hi Scott, You may want to review your patent applications against what is currently being done in XFDL.  </s>
<s> UWI would also be happy to have a look at them.  </s>
<s> We  </s>
<s> have been selling systems that digitally sign XML documents since at least  </s>
<s> January 1998, and we have dated technical specifications dated back to 4Q97  </s>
<s> and perhaps even 3Q97 (I'd have to check our archives).  </s>
<s> Hence if such a  </s>
<s> patent were awarded, then UWI would most likely be in a position to dispute  </s>
<s> the patent using UFDL and XFDL as "Prior Art".  </s>
