<s> To see how the datatyping proposal works for Dublin Core, I decided to convert the examples in the "Encoding Schemes" section of the Dublin Core in RDF Draft[1] to the new datatyping proposal.  </s>

<s> This appears to be consistent with DC practice.  </s>
<s> Should the property dct:mesh actually be dct:MESH?  </s>
<s> since that is the URI (qname) of the datatype in question?  </s>
<s> As an aside... (really ;-) Per http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-val-00.txt  </s>
<s> I would say rdfs:label "Formate Dehydrogenase" .  </s>
<s> This way, you only have to define the label once, rather than for every single occurrence of the datatype value.  </s>
<s> Of course, this also encourages one to just say _:page dc:subject val:(http://purl.org/dc/terms/MESH)D08.586.682.075.400 .  </s>
<s> but we won't go there ;-)  </s>
<s> At first glance, it looks OK.  </s>
<s> This presumes that the value space of dct:DCSV is a subset of the value space of dct:Point (though there need not be any intersection of their lexical spaces).  </s>
<s> It's nice to see the datatyping proposal resulting in some compression of the DC idioms ;-) Patrick  </s>
<s> I think this is a good format to use for the Use Cases sections, to simply reference one or more specifications for the application in question and take a set of examples directly from those specifications and show how they would be reexpressed using the datatyping idioms.  </s>
<s> Each Use Case section then serves as a very concrete point of intersection between the RDF Datatyping WD and the particular application specifications.  </s>
<s> Don't worry about doing any pretty formatting, etc. Something along the lines of what Aaron provided should be sufficient (i.e. N3 is OK).  </s>
<s> I'll put it into the same form as the examples in the core of the WD. Cheers, Patrick  </s>
