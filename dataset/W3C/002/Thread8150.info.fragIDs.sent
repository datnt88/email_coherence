<s> All, Dan and Lisa have suggested that we need to more clearly define either the use of the lockowner field or that we need a way to identify the owner of the lock.  </s>

<s> (Especially because the spec provides no way to reliably determine who owns a lock.)  </s>
<s> This is a good point -- and this is already a failing of WebDAV, with or without UNLOCK_BY_NON_LOCK_OWNER.  </s>
<s> Clients that crash or miss the  </s>

<s> from the server need to make sure that the lock is theirs before grabbing the lock token using PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> Can lockowner be used for this purpose?  </s>
<s> This should be a separate RFC2518 issue.  </s>
<s> How about "HOW_TO_IDENTIFY_LOCK_OWNER".  </s>
<s> Just as a point of information, I'd like to point out we have an issue on the issues list that is somewhat related: DEFINE_PRINCIPAL.  </s>
<s> In that issue Mark D Anderson says: The term "principal" is never defined in the WebDAV specification, or the HTTP or Digest specifications.  </s>
<s> It should be defined.  </s>
<s> Lisa and Dan, Could you define the requirement before we start the discussion?  </s>
<s> For example, is it for the server or the client that we need to make the clarification below?  </s>
<s> (I'll reference your clarfication from the issues list.)  </s>

<s> From: Clemm, Geoff In general, the user will not map 1-1 with a "principal", but rather a user will "match" one or more principals.  </s>
<s> Therefore I do not see that it is feasible or desireable to try to identify a particular principal for the current user.  </s>
<s> I do not fully understand.  </s>
<s> There is always a principal for a request (and be it {DAV:}anonymous), so it would be easy for a server to keep this information with an active lock.  </s>
<s> No, there are credentials for a request, but those credentials can match a variety of principals in a variety of different principal spaces relevant to the ACL on a resource.  </s>
<s> When there is a ACL privilege {DAV:}can-unlock and this is granted to a particular principal on the locked resource, the usualy ACL matching of principals would apply.  </s>
<s> It is not matching of principals that takes place, but rather the  </s>
<s> matching of the client credentials against the principals identified in the ACE of an ACL.  </s>
<s> So, I do not see the problem with reporting a locking-principal as part of an active lock.  </s>
<s> What am I missing?  </s>
<s> Servers without ACL?  </s>
<s> I think the only thing being missed is that a client has credentials, and that these credentials match a variety of principals, as opposed to identifying the client as *being* a particular principal.  </s>

<s> ...scanning acl spec...done.  </s>
<s> I see what you mean.  </s>
<s> There could be an ACL server which just has "group" principals and no principals with one-one relation to users (well it could even skip user credentials and just have credentials matching groups).  </s>
<s> As for identifying the owner of a lock this means one of the following: a) the server has a "primary" principal and could report it as lock owner.  </s>
<s> It may nevertheless choose not to do so, due to confidentiality reasons.  </s>
<s> b) the server has no such thing and thus cannot report who owns a lock.  </s>
<s> It only can tell if your credentials are sufficient to lock/unlock a resource.  </s>
<s> That leaves possible lock-owner information up to the client.  </s>
<s> Either it provides something meaningful to others (e.g. mailto:) or it is silent.  </s>
<s> Would that be a feasible way forward?  </s>

<s> That would still require that we define a format for this information (and we would have to deice whether to put it into the lockowner or into a new element).  </s>
