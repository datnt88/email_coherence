<s> Hi all, I am new to the list, so apoligies if this has been dealt with before.  </s>
<s> I did search the archives but couldn't find anything.  </s>
<s> I have a situation where double spaces in a URL are being converted to a single space.  </s>
<s> If I have fix-uri on, then it gets converted to a single %20.  </s>
<s> No other options appear to make any difference at all.  </s>
<s> I am using TidyATL 1.0.0.1 and can reproduce this using TidyUI.  </s>
<s> Example: Becomes either Or In both cases the link is now broken.  </s>
<s> It appears to have exactly the same issue with a tags.  </s>
<s> Any advice appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks Ben  </s>
<s> The link was broken already, since spaces aren't allowed in URIs.  </s>
<s> Fix the spaces (replace with %20) with something else before running Tidy.  </s>
<s> Yes, but shouldn't the two spaces be replaced with two %20 rather than one?  </s>
<s> Thanks Ben  </s>
<s> Hi Ben, I think you will find it difficult to maintain double spaces anywhere with Tidy as the parser condenses whitespace up front.  </s>
<s> No matter, Fred is right.  </s>
<s> Just use %20 for each space within a URL.  </s>
<s> IE has always done this for you automatically.  </s>
<s> It is only recently that Netscape and Opera started escaping URLs before a GET.  </s>
<s> Not sure about Konqueror.  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> `--literal-attributes yes` will preserve your spaces.  </s>
