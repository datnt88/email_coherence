<s> This is a followup clarification regarding the issue #13 assigned to me this Friday (what an inspiring number play) and christened "datatypes".  </s>
<s> At the same time, after giving some context information, I'm throwing the ball into the game by putting forth some (hopefully, provocative) suggestions.  </s>
<s> It seems to be generally acknowledged that the following 4 issues are closely related and, thus, may need to be resolved simultaneously: 1. Are literals resources?  </s>
<s> Tracked as: #rdfms-literals-as-resources Dependent issue: #rdfms-literalsubjects, would be resolved immediately if literals are resources  </s>
<s> 2. Are resource URIs opaque or composed of namespace + local name?  </s>
<s> Tracked as: #rdfms-uri-substructure Intro: 3. Are literals opaque or composed of unicode string + language ID/URI?  </s>
<s> Tracked as: #rdfms-xmllang Related: #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure Summary: (suggests literals are composite values) 4. How to use datatypes in RDF?  </s>
<s> Tracked as: #rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes Possible foundation: http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/  </s>
<s> Let me start the discussion backwards.  </s>
<s> What are the requirements for using datatypes?  </s>
<s> Here is a quote from - provide for primitive data typing, including byte, date, integer, sequence, SQL and Java primitive datatypes, etc.; - define a type system that is adequate for import/export from database systems (e.g., relational, object, OLAP); - distinguish requirements relating to lexical data representation vs. those governing an underlying information set; - allow creation of user-defined datatypes, such as datatypes that are derived from existing datatypes and which may constrain certain of its properties (e.g., range, precision, length, format).  </s>
<s> In other words, to use datatypes effectively, we must at least be able to: a) identify a resource (or literal) as a typed one b) refer to a datatype as a resource (this allows defining datatypes, determining their equivalence etc.) Here is a tentative suggestion of how datatypes may be introduced into RDF.  </s>
<s> This is also an attempt of a simultaneous attack on issues 1-4 above.  </s>
<s> Previously, I proposed several ways of treating literals as resources.  </s>
<s> For a change, here is an alternative view: s1) A resource is a pair of (URI, local name) (URIs may contain "#" etc.; this satisfies the M&amp;S requirement that given a property, one can retrieve the schema describing this property) s2) A literal is a pair resource, unicode string .  </s>
<s> The first component of a literal denotes its (data)type.  </s>
<s> That's it for now.  </s>
<s> Here is an example of how (s1),(s2) address (a),(b): Notice that the datatypes themselves are resources.  </s>
<s> For instance, a resource for "integer" defined in XML schema is (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes, integer).  </s>
<s> Literals are tagged using resources.  </s>
<s> For instance, value "5" is tagged as "integer" using (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes, integer), "5" .  </s>
<s> The definition of the datatype of the above primitive value "5" can be retrieved from http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes (according to M&amp;S requirement).  </s>
<s> These are the (possible) consequences: c1) Resources and literals are disjoint  </s>
<s> c2) Language tagging in literals is done using the typing mechanism, e.g. c3) #rdfms-literalsubjects is still open.  </s>
<s> c4) s1,s2 say nothing about the type system or creation of user-defined types.  </s>
<s> XML schema introduces a very elaborate one (maybe ugly, but comprehensive), which may or may not be worth mirroring in RDF.  </s>
<s> Rotten tomatoes are welcome.  </s>

<s> Here is an additional pointer dealing with 2001-09-28#13: (by DanC) Sergey  </s>
<s> Oh? I don't agree with that.  </s>
<s> We can say that literals are resources (indeed, I think it's pretty clear we have to) but we don't have to give them URIs, or a place in the RDF abstract  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> In the same vein:  </s>
<s> I don't think this is a consequence.  </s>
<s> Literals are not URIs, but they can be resources, and literal values can definitely be resources.  </s>
