<s> I'm torn ... On one hand a RM protocol is a "choreography" ... But on the other hand sensible people will not want to consider RM messages when describing their application-level choreography.  </s>

<s> It is not a simple issue.  </s>
<s> However, wrt RM, I think it is useful to focus on its WSDL definition.  </s>
<s> At an abstract level, what you are modeling there is QOS.  </s>
<s> How this is realized in terms of message flow is dependent on the binding.  </s>
<s> MEPs are a little different IMO because their whole purpose is to model message flow, although in a simpler form than choreography would.  </s>

<s> Another possiblity is to treat it as "out of bounds".  </s>
<s> Consider a port that is used to send/receive acknowledgments for the purpose of an RM protocol.  </s>
<s> Should such a port (or at least operation) be defined for each and every WSDL interface that supports some RM protocol?  </s>
<s> Or can that port be used "out of bounds" with respect to the actual service when the protocol selection/QoS dictates doing so?  </s>
<s> In the later case, the port is not defined as part of the service but indicated in the 'ackownledgment required' field of the sent message.  </s>
<s> The same could also apply to the combination of choreography and RM.  </s>
<s> A high-level choreography definition could be written ignoring details related to RM by talking about specific interfaces.  </s>
<s> Where RM is used, the actual transport would involve additional interfaces/ports, which could well be defined by a different choreography.  </s>
<s> But being "out of bounds" the RM choreography is not directly used to compose the high-level choreography, but rather is used when the QoS dictates using it.  </s>
