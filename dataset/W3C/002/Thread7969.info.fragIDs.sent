There is a short list partway down the page on date, but it is the only one that I know of at the moment.

I maintain an up-to-date list of WebDAV clients and servers on the WebDAV Working Group home page: The list is about halfway down the page. 
Since I'm also a maintainer of the WebDAV.org site, I'll accept some demerits for not mirroring my changes there, too.
