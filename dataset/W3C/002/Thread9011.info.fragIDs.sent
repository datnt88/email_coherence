<s> My apologies for missing the Apr 27 meeting.  </s>
<s> I scanned the IRC log and I have a question about what the WG decided wrt the rdf-ns-prefix-confusion issue: [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion  </s>
<s> My input for the this issue was given in: [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Apr/0047.html  </s>
<s> and it contains: 1.  </s>
<s> The grammar in section 6. of the M&amp;S spec: should be changed so that all of the RDF attributes (e.g. about, resource, etc.) are qualified with a RDF namespace.  </s>
<s> In the meeting log: [3] http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2001-04-27.html it says: RESOLVED: strongly recommend namespace qualified attributes, allow but strongly deprecate unqualified attributes  </s>
<s> Does this mean that instead of changing the grammar as recommended in 1. in [2], that some text like that which is found in the IRC log (RESOLVED: strongly ...) will be added to the spec?  </s>
<s> Also, wrt process, will the IRC logs serve as the WG's minutes?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Art  </s>
<s> I cannot speak for the rest of the group, but it was my understanding that the grammar would be corrected but a portion would be added to the spec noting the issue, the fact that it is currently in use, and that it is strongly deprecated and not likely to be included future versions.  </s>

<s> ongly deprecate unqualified attributes  </s>
<s> I'll try to make a more formal list of what I see as the results of the consensus at the first meeting on this issue.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The grammar will be corrected to require namespace-qualified attributes for RDF concepts [leaving aside for now how the grammar will be expressed].  </s>
<s> Namespace prefixes MUST be used on RDF attributes.  </s>
<s> 2. Existing parsers MUST accept the about, id etc. attributes in unqualified form on input but MUST NOT emit them on output.  </s>
<s> 3. The unprefixed attributes are deprecated and MAY be forbidden in future versions of the syntax.  </s>
<s> Replying to the W3C team comments in [[1.  </s>
<s> The grammar in section 6. of the M&amp;S spec: should be changed so that all of the RDF attributes (e.g. about, resource, etc.) are qualified with a RDF namespace.  </s>
<s> This was agreed and I think covered in items 1-3 above [[2.  </s>
<s> Text along the lines of the following should be added to the M&amp;S spec: All elements and attributes in RDF must be namespace qualified I felt the consensus was that the elements part of the above text was not quite right (since elements can have default namespaces).  </s>
<s> The grammar does need correcting here to reflect that so another item: 4. The grammar must be corrected to allow non-namespace qualified RDF elements when a default XML namespace is defined (xmlns="...").  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Looking over this again, I think this should be changed to: Parsers MAY accept the about, id, etc. attributes in  </s>
<s> unqualified form on input but MUST NOT emit them on output.  </s>
<s> Why would we want to make an additional rules for "existing parsers"?  </s>
<s> Also, do we define how parsers should interpret unqualified attributes?  </s>
<s> If so, how should one process this testcase (as raised by Jason Diamond on rdf-interest): [ Aaron Swartz | me@aaronsw.com  </s>
<s> | http://www.aaronsw.com  </s>
<s> ]  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz said:  </s>
<s> OK, 'existing' was too much.  </s>
<s> But the MUST should stay.  </s>
<s> The core of existing syntax MUST continue to be accepted and thus this wording, which is a conformance declaration of RDF/XML syntax processors (and hence new to RDF) should apply to ensure the existing syntax remains.  </s>
<s> The wording "parsers MUST accept the about, id, etc. attributes in unqualified form" applies thus this (continues to be) a legal typedNode production.  </s>
<s> Existing parsers that don't accept that are broken, IMHO since not only does the RDF M&amp;S document contains examples of both, but the existing grammar uses the about attribute without a prefix.  </s>
<s> So taking Jason's example in and fleshing it out - see first attachement [cloaked as text/html to get it stored in mail archive] In future we will add words that require that all processors of the above MUST return two statements (s,p,o form): (http://foo, rdf:type, http://example.org/Class)  </s>
<s> (http://foo, http://example.org/property,  </s>
<s> "bar") and is equivalent to the rdf:about form as given in the second attachment.  </s>
<s> On output, conformant processors MUST emit RDF/XML like the second attachment.  </s>
<s> Please ignore issues of serialising ordering, namespace prefixes that haven't been considered yet.  </s>
<s> Is this clearer?  </s>
<s> (Note: online SiRPAC gets this wrong with first example and needs rdf:about form of second example.  </s>
<s> I haven't tested other parsers) Dave  </s>
