<s> XML 1.0 allows also comments and processing instructions to be child nodes of the root.  </s>
<s> Why are these nodes eliminated?  </s>
<s> They aren't eliminated.  </s>
<s> The text, PI and comment node children of the root are processed in accordance with the rules for that node type.  </s>
<s> Each has a document order, so it will be processed as a function of processing the node-set.  </s>
<s> * In section 4, in the specification for namespace and attribute node text generation, I found the following sentence: "[...] and all whitespace characters (#x9, #xA, #xD, and #x20) with character references, except for #x20 characters with no preceding #x20."  </s>
<s> I am sorry I do not understand the last part of this sentence.  </s>
<s> Could you please give an example?  </s>
<s> Though the sentence technically works, I now realize that it attempts to fix a problem that doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> The sentence fragment can therefore be replaced by: "[...] and the whitespace characters #x9, #xA, and #xD with character references."  </s>
<s> The problem was simply that I wanted to retain any extra spaces that managed to get included by character reference in the normalized value of non-CDATA attributes.  </s>
<s> I had thought that whitespace characters included by character reference were not normalized out, but it is now clear to me that this is true of most whitespace characters but not of actual space characters.  </s>
<s> In other words, sequences of #x9, #xA and #xD characters may appear but not #x20 characters.  </s>
<s> Therefore, in non-CDATA attributes, every #x20 character has no preceding #x20 and so would be encoded as a #x20 character not as the &amp;#x20; character reference.  </s>
<s> This is why the short description works.  </s>

<s> This draft is not acceptable at all.  </s>
<s> Existing XML processors does not inform whitespaces outside the root element to applications, and SAX parsers can not inform comments.  </s>
<s> To modify XML processors for this specification is impractical.  </s>
<s> I know the XPath processes comments and whitespaces outside the root element.  </s>
<s> It is better approach to write a note what is interoperable XPath expressions for XML Signature Transform than to modify existing XML processors.  </s>
