<s> Peter, after my mini-epiphany during the telecon yesterday, I had an even better one :-).  </s>
<s> I think that there is a very tiny, if unconventional, change to the RDF MT which will allow it to accommodate smoothly to your (or anyone else's) proposed treatment of literals: simply say (with some explanatory prose :-) that the XL mapping is a fixed mapping from literal TOKENS to literal values.  </s>
<s> That is, it allows one occurrence of whatever 05 /whatever to denote an integer and another one to denote a string, just as long as they each denote the same thing in every interpretation.  </s>
<s> This allows both the case where every literal is simply a string which denotes itself, and it also allows the extreme other case where an elaborate external datatyping process assigns special values in all sorts of ways.  </s>
<s> However, it does insist that each literal label token has a fixed interpretation; it doesn't tolerate ambiguity of any *particular* literal label.  </s>
<s> I don't want to allow that kind of ambiguity.  </s>
<s> This will leave entirely mysterious how anyone or anything could determine what the actual denotation of any particular literal token actually is, of course.  </s>
<s> That is assumed to be done somehow, but is outside the scope of the MT itself.  </s>
<s> With this change in wording, the actual equations can remain as they are.  </s>
<s> Would that be sufficient flexibility for you, along with allowing IR to consist of both resources and literal values, so that rdfs:Literal doesn't force literal values to be resources?  </s>
<s> Pat PS I'm cross-posting this to both groups in case anyone can see a fatal objection.  </s>

<s> Can I try to clarify what I think you're saying... Different occurrences of a literal within a graph may map to different values, but that these mappings are fixed, and may not change when a different interpretation is used for the graph.  </s>

<s> [a Shoe] decimalSize [ a type:Integer ; rdf:value "10" ] ; sizeLabel [ a type:String ; rdf:value "10" ] .  </s>
<s> The intent here is that the first occurrence is mapped to an integer, and the second to a string.  </s>
<s> BUT, doesn't this depend in some way on the interpretation of type:Integer and type:String?  </s>

<s> Right, that is what I had in mind.  </s>
<s> However, Peter wants a slightly different notion, in which the interpretation *does* determine (or at any rate *can* determine) the literal mappings.  </s>
<s> This seems to amount to treating literals rather like bNodes with a kind of potential datatype constraint on them (that can be inferred from rdfs:range assertions in the graph, in Peter's scheme: see ).  </s>
<s> I have to say, I don't like this myself.  </s>
<s> But maybe I will have to just shut up and go along with the crowd.  </s>
<s> Maybe. Actually I'm not sure how to parse that example.  </s>
<s> Is that two triples or four triples?  </s>
