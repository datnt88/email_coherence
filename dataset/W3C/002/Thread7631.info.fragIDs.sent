<s> Did section 8.10.6 of 2518 meant to say that an exclusive lock will fail if there already is a lock *of that locktype* on that resource, or if there is *any* exclusive lock there?  </s>
<s> I can see arguments for both directions, and implementors probably haven't thought that much about it since everybody is just doing write locks, but I assume the authors had one or the other in mind?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> The intent was for the exclusivity to apply per locktype.  </s>
<s> So, for example, an exclusive read lock would not affect taking out an exclusive write lock.  </s>
<s> However, it is possible to imagine lock types that would have semantics that are not orthogonal to existing locks.  </s>
<s> For example, while read and write are pretty orthogonal, and hence exclusive read and exclusive write locks can co-exist happily on the same resource, a hypothetical "read/write" lock type would interfere with both a write lock and a (equally hypothetical) read lock, and in this case I would expect a request for an exclusive read/write lock to fail if there is either a shared read lock, or a shared write lock, or an exclusive read lock, or an exclusive write lock on the resource.  </s>
<s> So, the best answer is, when defining a new lock type the interactions of the new lock type with all existing lock types needs to be taken into consideration when creating the lock compatibility table.  </s>

<s> What Jim says is all reasonable, but cannot currently be inferred from the working in 2518.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest this be added to the issues list.  </s>
<s> In particular, I think it is reasonable for 2518 to say that an exclusive lock for a given locktype MUST not coexist with another lock of that same locktype.  </s>
<s> This gives a reasonable minimal semantics to "exclusive", while letting additional locktype specific semantics to be defined.  </s>
