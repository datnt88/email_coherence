<s> Hello Norman,  </s>
<s> I remember once asking if there was a normative definition of normative.  </s>
<s> (This certainly came up in questions of dependencies between specifications.) Regardless, never saw anything in writing and a convention for the W3C has yet to appear [1] though some WGs use the distinction.  </s>
<s> However, I've found the context of the reference to be more useful than this distinction in a bibliography and most of our references are normative (in that the import meaning/protocol/procedure necessary for xmldsig conformance).  </s>
<s> Quickly eyeballing them I'd say everything is normative except for: Informative: read for interesting context/background [ABA,RDF,SOAP,XHTML1.0,XLink,XML-Japanese] Important: I expect you should read if you're going to be capable of implementing the spec but no meaning is imported.  </s>

<s> My own feeling is that a reference should be normative if and only if the specification making the reference includes a definition from the referenced specification.  </s>
<s> So, if you say, "whitespace (as defined by production 3 of the XML Rec) ..." you're making a normative reference to the XML Rec.  </s>
<s> If you say, "constructed from the object model of the document, for example the DOM Level 1 object model or the XPath data model, ..." then you're not making a normative reference.  </s>
<s> However, I have to admit that my own interest in this case was for reasons having nothing to do with technically understanding the spec, so it's not something I feel very strongly about.  </s>
<s> But I do think specs editors should make the distinction clear.  </s>

<s> I suspect that the phrases normative and non-normative references are coming from the formal standards body arena of ISO, IEC, ITU and so on.  </s>
<s> In that environment a normative reference is used in order to incorporate the effect if another standard into the one in hand.  </s>
<s> The effect is broader than just incorporating a definition or two - you can do that by taking a definition and referring to its source.  </s>
<s> For a formal standard there is a conformance requirement, and the normative reference binds the conformance as well as the text.  </s>
<s> Non-normative references tend to be those which are therefore not formally bound to the standard but are useful references.  </s>
<s> They tend to be used where it is not reasonable to try and bind the reference text to the standard - it may not be a formal standard for instance and therefore no-one can guarantee it is being maintained or that it has been checked or has general consensus for acceptance and use and so on.  </s>
<s> Since there are many standards fora, the terms may have different meanings in different locales.  </s>
<s> Kind regards Steve Mathews  </s>
