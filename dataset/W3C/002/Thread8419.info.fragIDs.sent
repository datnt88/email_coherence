<s> From reading the RFC2518, it's not clear to me that if I'm using a delete method to remove a non-collection resource, is it possible that server still returns a multitasks response?  </s>

<s> Stanley, I think it is *unlikely* that you'll get a 207 on a non-collection.  </s>
<s> However, I wouldn't rely on that, and no, there's no way to enforce a specific server behaviour.  </s>
