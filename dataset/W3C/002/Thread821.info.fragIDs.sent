<s> Hi Guys, I emailed the following to the author of the TidyCom, found at: But thought someone here may know about this.  </s>
<s> Thanks, ..matthew Hi Andr?,  </s>
<s> I'm not sure but I may have found a possible bug in TidyCom.  </s>
<s> I'm accessing the dll from a C# program and everything seems to be working fine except Options.Doctype.  </s>
<s> It doesn't seem to make any difference if I load a tidy config file with the line "doctype: omit" in it or set that option manually in the program, the original line -in this case the one below- is always left in.  </s>
<s> I need to get rid of this line to make the tidied output xml compliant html.  </s>
<s> I've also tried setting the doctype option to a custom string, but this doesn't work either although the Options.Doctype property correctly displays the custom string if I write it to the screen before calling: "TidyToFile(inFilename, outFilename);".  </s>
<s> Please let me know if there is a work around this, especially if there's  </s>
<s> a way to stop tidycom from putting !DOCTYPE 's in the output even if in the input.  </s>
<s> Thank you for making TidyCom open source and available free; it is appreciated.  </s>
<s> Many thanks and regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> I don't know what version of the base Tidy source code, TidyCom is using, but there were a number of bugs in the base Tidy source code related to DOCTYPEs, including issues with "doctype: omit", that we believe have now been fixed.  </s>
<s> You may have to wait for Andr? to update TidyCom to use the latest base Tidy source code (if it is just a matter of updating a Tidy executable that TidyCom uses, that is even easier - I don't know enough about TidyCom to help further).  </s>
<s> I don't know of any workarounds.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> It does help -- thanks Terry.  </s>
<s> For my purposes I need only the html 'body' so I thought using the show-body-only option would be an effective workaround; since doctypes are positioned even before the html tag I would get rid of them.  </s>
<s> However show-body-only being set to true also does not seem to work in TidyCom, perhaps I am not using TidyCom properly or have there also been problems with that in earlier versions of the base Tidy source code?  </s>
<s> --I am pretty sure my code is correct because the other options I am using,  </s>
<s> such as outputting in xml, indenting and wrapping, all seem to work well.  </s>
<s> I have written some code to provide me with 'just the body' today so I don't need to use TidyCom to do this or to get rid of the doctype tag anymore.  </s>
<s> Still I'd be interested to know what the current and past status of these options are within Tidy and TidyCom.  </s>
<s> No word from Andr? yet, I guess he's busy (fair play TidyCom is free  </s>
<s> after all) or maybe taking a holiday in the alps, although I hear France is a little short of snow this year.  </s>
<s> I'm CCing this to him anyway.  </s>
<s> Thanks and regards,  </s>
<s> ..matthew  </s>
<s> That is indeed the case.  </s>
<s> TidyCOM is based IIRC on the Aug. 4, 2000 code.  </s>
<s> Show-body-only was added after that.  </s>
<s> Too bad -- I hope Andr?  </s>
<s> (or someone!) does an equivalent DLL component based on the new (and very promising) development going on.  </s>
<s> Any word from him?  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> No, afraid not.  </s>
<s> There is a message on the TidyCom web site saying he's no longer able to maintain TidyCom and asking if anyone would like to  </s>
<s> continue his work.  </s>
<s> --I wish I had the time!  </s>
<s> I have written a method to provide me with just the body of some html.  </s>
<s> It's in C# and you're welcome to a copy, but if you're capable of using TidyCom then I am sure you are capable of writing this small bit of code too.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you hear of anyone taking over TidyCom please.  </s>
<s> Andr? -- Many thanks for TidyCom, it's really useful to me.  </s>
<s> Regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> Bummer.  </s>
<s> But thanks for the heads up.  </s>
<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> Actually, I wasn't wanting that option in particular, but many of the other, newer options.  </s>
<s> Thank you, though!  </s>
<s> I echo that thanks -- many times over!  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Such as: "doctype: omit"  </s>
<s> What other options do not work?  </s>
<s> Regards, ..matthew  </s>
<s> No, that was in the August 4, 2000 release too (and, I think, even earlier ones).  </s>
<s> Compare the list of config-file and command-line options at to /Jelks  </s>
