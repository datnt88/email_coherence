Hi Guys, I emailed the following to the author of the TidyCom, found at: But thought someone here may know about this. 
Thanks, ..matthew Hi Andr?, 
I'm not sure but I may have found a possible bug in TidyCom. 
I'm accessing the dll from a C# program and everything seems to be working fine except Options.Doctype. 
It doesn't seem to make any difference if I load a tidy config file with the line "doctype: omit" in it or set that option manually in the program, the original line -in this case the one below- is always left in. 
I need to get rid of this line to make the tidied output xml compliant html. 
I've also tried setting the doctype option to a custom string, but this doesn't work either although the Options.Doctype property correctly displays the custom string if I write it to the screen before calling: "TidyToFile(inFilename, outFilename);". 
Please let me know if there is a work around this, especially if there's 
a way to stop tidycom from putting !DOCTYPE 's in the output even if in the input. 
Thank you for making TidyCom open source and available free; it is appreciated. 
Many thanks and regards, ..matthew 
I don't know what version of the base Tidy source code, TidyCom is using, but there were a number of bugs in the base Tidy source code related to DOCTYPEs, including issues with "doctype: omit", that we believe have now been fixed. 
You may have to wait for Andr? to update TidyCom to use the latest base Tidy source code (if it is just a matter of updating a Tidy executable that TidyCom uses, that is even easier - I don't know enough about TidyCom to help further). 
I don't know of any workarounds. 
Hope this helps. 
Regards, Terry 
It does help -- thanks Terry. 
For my purposes I need only the html 'body' so I thought using the show-body-only option would be an effective workaround; since doctypes are positioned even before the html tag I would get rid of them. 
However show-body-only being set to true also does not seem to work in TidyCom, perhaps I am not using TidyCom properly or have there also been problems with that in earlier versions of the base Tidy source code? 
--I am pretty sure my code is correct because the other options I am using, 
such as outputting in xml, indenting and wrapping, all seem to work well. 
I have written some code to provide me with 'just the body' today so I don't need to use TidyCom to do this or to get rid of the doctype tag anymore. 
Still I'd be interested to know what the current and past status of these options are within Tidy and TidyCom. 
No word from Andr? yet, I guess he's busy (fair play TidyCom is free 
after all) or maybe taking a holiday in the alps, although I hear France is a little short of snow this year. 
I'm CCing this to him anyway. 
Thanks and regards, 
..matthew 
That is indeed the case. 
TidyCOM is based IIRC on the Aug. 4, 2000 code. 
Show-body-only was added after that. 
Too bad -- I hope Andr? 
(or someone!) does an equivalent DLL component based on the new (and very promising) development going on. 
Any word from him? 
/Jelks 
No, afraid not. 
There is a message on the TidyCom web site saying he's no longer able to maintain TidyCom and asking if anyone would like to 
continue his work. 
--I wish I had the time! 
I have written a method to provide me with just the body of some html. 
It's in C# and you're welcome to a copy, but if you're capable of using TidyCom then I am sure you are capable of writing this small bit of code too. 
Let me know if you hear of anyone taking over TidyCom please. 
Andr? -- Many thanks for TidyCom, it's really useful to me. 
Regards, ..matthew 
Bummer. 
But thanks for the heads up. 
Me too. 
Actually, I wasn't wanting that option in particular, but many of the other, newer options. 
Thank you, though! 
I echo that thanks -- many times over! 
/Jelks 
Such as: "doctype: omit" 
What other options do not work? 
Regards, ..matthew 
No, that was in the August 4, 2000 release too (and, I think, even earlier ones). 
Compare the list of config-file and command-line options at to /Jelks
