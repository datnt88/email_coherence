Hello Spec-prod, The QA Activity has started a while ago a Wiki [1] as a community place to share thoughts, techniques and ideas on how to improve the QA practices in W3C ; a fair number of the topics addressed in this Wiki concern the problems that may arise when writing a specification ; in particular: * Usage of RFC Keywords http://esw.w3.org/topic/RfcKeywords * defining a language through semantics or operations (http://esw.w3.org/topic/MeaningVsBehavior) * defining errors handling in a spec * possible issues when defining a language both in a formal language and in English prose http://esw.w3.org/topic/FormalLanguageVsProse 
Since this forum is the main way of communication with and between W3C Editors, the QA Activity would be very interested to get feedback and/or direct participation on these pages from the participants of this mailing list. 
I'm also interested in knowing if W3C Editors would be interested in a more formal community to exchange tips and ideas using this same mailing list, or if they would rather keep it in this low-traffic state. 
Thanks, Dom 1. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-qa/2004Mar/0039.html

There are two mailing lists that might be relevant here, w3c-editors 
(member-only) and www-publications (public). 
Both are unfortunately 
neither really documented nor used... 
Hm... the archive of that list has only one message in it, in March 2001. 
Probably a naming mistake or something. 
That one's new to me, but sure enough... "Its purpose is to provide an archived public mailing list for comments on W3C's publication guidelines and style guides." -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-publications/2001Aug/0001.html 
The only traffic in the archive seems to be spam. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May?
