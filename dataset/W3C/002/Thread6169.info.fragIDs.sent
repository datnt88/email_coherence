<s> Here is a proposal for the features and properties associated with the http binding and soap http binding, based on discussion with Arthur.  </s>
<s> abstract level: The goal of defining them at the abstract level as well would be to provide a hint to the implementation.  </s>
<s> Their use is not required.  </s>
<s> Mapping XML Schema complexType into an HTTP GET won't be done.  </s>
<s> Of course, you can serialize the Infoset in the URI but who would like to use those uris?  </s>
<s> Based on the abstract feature, one can determine if a result is cachable for example, even if an HTTP POST is used underneath.  </s>
<s> feature name http://www.example.org/CRUD  </s>
<s> property name: http://www.example.org/method  </s>
<s> value space: create | retrieve | update | delete  </s>
<s> HTTP binding: feature property name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/web-method/method  </s>
<s> value space: PUT | GET | POST | DELETE SOAP HTTP binding: feature property  </s>
<s> name: http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap/features/web-method/Method value space: PUT | GET | POST | DELETE Do we need to invent a new feature for the HTTP binding?  </s>
<s> Well, not really, but it would be good if people don't associate systematically the SOAP Web Method Feature with SOAP itself.  </s>
<s> It's more a feature that needs to be attached to HTTP imho but the URI used does not reflect that.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> What about adding the following feature, to cover setting HTTP header fields, which we've postponed[1] until features were available?  </s>
<s> HTTP binding: feature property name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/header-field/name  </s>
<s> type: xsd:string property name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/header-field/value  </s>
<s> type: xsd:string  </s>
<s> We could also generalize this features for any protocol, not just HTTP, i.e. define it at the abstract level.  </s>
<s> Jean-Jacques. [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2002Sep/0050.html  </s>
<s> How useful would it be?  </s>
<s> The accept, accept-ranges, content-type, authorization, cache-control, connection and content-length are already fixed by other means.  </s>
<s> accept-language has nothing to do in the WSDL.  </s>
<s> Do you have an example of an header that needs to be fixed and should not be represented in a more abstract way?  </s>
<s> How do you set two headers with the approach?  </s>
<s> imho, we should focus on the needs themselves, not the way they are represented in the protocol.  </s>
<s> Authorization is a good example of such case.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> The WG wanted a way to set the value of certain HTTP header fields (Jacek in particular, I think).  </s>
<s> An earlier, non feature based proposal was postponed until work on features resumed.  </s>
<s> So, yes, some have found this feature (sic) useful.  </s>
<s> JJ.  </s>
