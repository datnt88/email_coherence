Now this messy topic is on the table, I have a proposal: DEFINE URI-view to be an absolute URI with an optional fragment identifier, and use this term in relevant RDF documents. 
Thus, augmenting the syntax productions from RFC2396, we have: 
URI-view = absoluteURI [ '#' fragment ] 
RATIONALE (for "URI-view") 1. URI-view is short, hence easy to write. 
2. URI-view is easy to speak. 
3. The term URI-view is not currently used for any conflicting purpose (to my knowledge). 
4. In http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Model.html and identifier as identifying a "view" or "part" within a document.

I didn't realize we'd get around to this issue so soon, but to warn the Working Group, I believe that these "URI-views", or whatever we wish to call them, should be removed from the RDF spec. 
It seems odd to claim we're the "Resource Description Framework" when many of the identifiers we use have no binding to Resources! 
RDF needs to respect the layers it's building on top of, and the 
URI spec is one of those. 
More information on the issue is at: Which perhaps should be linked to rdfms-fragments on the Issues List.

Aaron, I have much sympathy with the concerns you raise. 
But... 
:We :between ( [a :Rock] [ a :Place ; :feel :Hard ] ) . 
"We're between a rock and a hard place." 
... much as we might wish to fix this problem, I think that it's beyond our charter to do so, for reasons of backwards compatibility.

:We :between ( [a :Rock] [ a :Place ; :feel :Hard ] ) . 
"We're between a rock and a hard place." 
I disagree with that statement -- our charter is to fix problems with the spec! 
Obviously we must attempt to do it in a backwards compatible way, but this is no excuse to ignore the issue. 
There are a number of solutions to this issue, and only one of them is making documents with WebRefs/URI-views illegal.

"We're between a rock and a hard place." 
Well, I apologize if I misunderstood you, but that seemed to be what you were suggesting. 
I find it difficult to see how we can resolve this without (a) disallowing "URI-view"s in RDF, or (b) undertaking a possibly rat-holing task of redefining the nature of URIs and URI-references when used with RDF, which I think may be stretching the charter. 
However, I do think it is an important issue and I am open to other ideas.

Well, not resolving the issue would place us squarely in the territory of (b), I would think. 
Other options I can see: - Make some noise about deprecating URI-views in RDF and politely ask people to stop using them - (ugly kludge) Map URI-views into some other form of URI, such as: = kludge/?uri=http://www.example.org/foo&amp;view=bar
