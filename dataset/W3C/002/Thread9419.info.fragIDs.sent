<s> Now this messy topic is on the table, I have a proposal: DEFINE URI-view to be an absolute URI with an optional fragment identifier, and use this term in relevant RDF documents.  </s>
<s> Thus, augmenting the syntax productions from RFC2396, we have:  </s>
<s> URI-view = absoluteURI [ '#' fragment ]  </s>
<s> RATIONALE (for "URI-view") 1. URI-view is short, hence easy to write.  </s>
<s> 2. URI-view is easy to speak.  </s>
<s> 3. The term URI-view is not currently used for any conflicting purpose (to my knowledge).  </s>
<s> 4. In http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Model.html and identifier as identifying a "view" or "part" within a document.  </s>

<s> I didn't realize we'd get around to this issue so soon, but to warn the Working Group, I believe that these "URI-views", or whatever we wish to call them, should be removed from the RDF spec.  </s>
<s> It seems odd to claim we're the "Resource Description Framework" when many of the identifiers we use have no binding to Resources!  </s>
<s> RDF needs to respect the layers it's building on top of, and the  </s>
<s> URI spec is one of those.  </s>

<s> I disagree with that statement -- our charter is to fix problems with the spec!  </s>
<s> Obviously we must attempt to do it in a backwards compatible way, but this is no excuse to ignore the issue.  </s>
<s> There are a number of solutions to this issue, and only one of them is making documents with WebRefs/URI-views illegal.  </s>

<s> Well, I apologize if I misunderstood you, but that seemed to be what you were suggesting.  </s>
<s> I find it difficult to see how we can resolve this without (a) disallowing "URI-view"s in RDF, or (b) undertaking a possibly rat-holing task of redefining the nature of URIs and URI-references when used with RDF, which I think may be stretching the charter.  </s>
<s> However, I do think it is an important issue and I am open to other ideas.  </s>
<s> #g  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne (GK@ACM.ORG)  </s>
<s> Well, not resolving the issue would place us squarely in the territory of (b), I would think.  </s>
<s> Other options I can see: - Make some noise about deprecating URI-views in RDF and politely ask people to stop using them - (ugly kludge) Map URI-views into some other form of URI, such as: = kludge/?uri=http://www.example.org/foo&amp;view=bar  </s>
