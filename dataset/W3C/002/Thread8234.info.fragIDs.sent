The WebDAV Working Group hereby requests consideration of the WebDAV Ordered Collections protocol as a Proposed Standard. 
The specification for this protocol can be found in draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-08 : xt Abstract: This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol to support server-side ordering of collection members. 
Of particular interest are orderings that are not based on property values, and so cannot be achieved using a search protocol's ordering option and cannot be maintained automatically by the server. 
Protocol elements are defined to let clients specify the position in the ordering of each collection member, as well as the semantics governing the ordering. 
It is my judgement that this specification represents the rough consensus of the WebDAV Working Group, having passed through a 4 week long working group last call for comments period, receiving only minimal comments (resolved in the current -08 specification). 
The specification resolves known engineering tradeoffs, and to the best of my knowledge, represents a solid basis for the construction of interoperable implementations. 
- Jim Whitehead Co-Chair, WebDAV Working Group 
Jim, Thanks for your message. 
I have updated the draft's status in the tracker to reflect the request for publication. 
If there are issues to resolve prior to last call, I will contact you and the working group; if not, the next step will be a two week IETF last call for proposed standard. 
regards, Ted Hardie 
Hi. Ted Hardie has raised the following issue with the current draft of the ordering protocol... 
In section 6.1 we say: "Note to implementors: this specification does not mandate a specific implementation of MOVE operations within the same parent collection. 
Therefore, servers may either implement this as a simple rename operation (preserving the collection member's position), or as a sequence of "remove" and "add" (causing the semantics of "adding a new member" to apply). 
Future revisions of this specification may specify this behaviour more precisely based on future implementation experience." 
The issue here is that *if* we don't want to mandate a specific server behaviour, we should at least give client developers some guidance about how to achieve what they want (in this case a simple "rename" within the same parent collection where the ordering -- if present -- is preserved). 
The pseudo-code for this would be: 1) PROPFIND/Depth 1 on parent collection, getting DAV:ordering-type 2) if DAV:ordering-type not present or == "dav:unordered", just proceed as before 3) determine position of member to be renamed (such as "first" or "after x") 4) add Position header to MOVE request, specifying the previous position This should work with both kinds of servers (the one implementing this as UNBIND/BIND will obey the Position header, the other one will simply ignore it and thereby preserve the ordering). 
Is everybody OK with this example being added to the draft?
