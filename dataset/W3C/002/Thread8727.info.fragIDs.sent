<s> This might be somewhat forward-looking but given that the KeyInfo element will likely be re-used for the future XML Encryption spec, would it not make sense to give it its own namespace?  </s>
<s> We could for example, use these three namespaces: "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/signature#" for the Signature-specific elements "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/encryption#" for the Encryption-specific elements  </s>
<s> "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/keyinfo#" for the the KeyInfo element  </s>

<s> I'm not sure what this buys us (besides more namespaces).  </s>
<s> The dsig namespace  </s>

<s> In my opinion, this buys a clearly structured repository of references to cryptographic algorithms and structures.  </s>
<s> It simplifies re-use of definitions,  </s>
<s> since you know where to look if you want to include a reference to an algorithm  </s>
<s> in your self-defined XML document.  </s>
<s> Speaking of re-use, has there been any discussion in the past about including  </s>
<s> some sort of reference to well-known OIDs for cryptographic algorithms?  </s>

<s> Yes, it somehow does not feel right to avoid ASN.1 on the one side and introduce OID's.  </s>
<s> What might make sense however would be to compose some informational document containing an equivalence table between the well known OID's and the URI's.  </s>

<s> Actually, your example is fine.  </s>
<s> Adding a new namespace for general crypto references is not so much a matter of simplifying a concrete specification, but can help (in my view) to make the design of additional Schemata using crypto easier, as there is a canonical place to look for previous definitions of crypto primitives.  </s>
<s> It could help to avoid multiple definitions of the same algorithms in several places, as happened with OIDs.  </s>
<s> As I have not been involved in the XML Signature definition process up to now, I am not sure if, how and when this can be realized, but I like the idea of crypto namespaces along the lines sketched by Ed Simon, where the definions might even contain informational mappings to OIDs.  </s>
