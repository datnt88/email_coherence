In the telecon today I said that I had objections to postponing the following two issues: 
This is not because I agree with the proposed resolution, it is instead because I feel these two issues are the only way the WG will address some major problems with RDF 1.0, that I feel it needs to. 
Implementers, most notably Uche Ogbuji, have expressed concern over the poorly defined rdf:value property. 
It has caused problems with the publication of the Dublin Core in RDF draft, 
as DC isn't entirely sure of rdf:value's meaning. 
This is an 
issue the WG must clarify, somehow or another. 
I'm not insisting that we rename rdf:value or get rid of it, but ignoring it is not an option, and seems a violation of (at least the spirit of) our charter (if we're chartered to fix RDF's bugs, this is a big bug we need to fix). 
On qname-uri-mapping, I strongly disagree with Borden's proposal, and don't believe there is a need for it. 
However, I _do_ feel there is a need for the Working Group to at least _explain_ why it has chosen to break compatibility with the URI spec and instead use some new thing some have termed URIviews. 
If you feel that new issues should be opened for the problems that I've raised, so we can postpone the old ones, then fine. 
But I don't think the WG should be let off the hook.

Ah, I'm pleased to hear that, in fact, in a schadenfreude-ish kind of way, as it seems rather zany from the MT point of view as well, and in fact unnecessary if one does datatyping right. 
Maybe it is simply broken.

I agree with Pat's comment that rdf:value will probably be taken care of in datatyping (it may disapper, although I think it still may be useful - use cases and possible interpretation are in my recent "suggestions for datatyping" posting). 
As to qname-uri-mapping, I believe it could be merged with uri-substructure.
