<s> up to the standard that defines those live properties.  </s>
<s> So we should probably try to define the versioning behavior for 2518  </s>
<s> properties in 2518bis.  </s>
<s> In general, the simplest default versioning behavior for a  </s>
<s> property such as DAV:displayname is to treat it the same as a dead  </s>
<s> property,  </s>
<s> i.e. it is an immutable copy of the value of that property on the VCR at  </s>

<s> One of the considerations for RFC2518bis is whether each feature specified meets the interoperability bar for IETF draft standard publication.  </s>
