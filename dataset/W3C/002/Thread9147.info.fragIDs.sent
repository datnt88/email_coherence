Discuss the strawman document structure: (15 mins) Goal - identify issues and concerns. 
So far we have: o we need to get started and see the material before getting into lengthy theoretical discussions o how much 'explanatory' material should the spec have o which are we revising/clarifying and which are new work products o timescales/resources o don't make folks read two documents o do we need an executive overview o where do n-triples fit in the spec o moving containers/reification may cause problems with review process (what problems?) Propose we take a shot at a first draft of a core model spec based on the current M&amp;S document merged with the appropriate sections of the model theory. 
Model Theory (10 mins) Goal - discuss initial responses - identify how to move forward Issue #rdfms-glossary Martyn (10 mins) Goal - decide what we are doing about the glossary and assign actions. 
Issue #rdfs-transitive-subProperty (10 mins) Review Jan's message Propose that the ancestor/parent example clarifies why sub-properties of transitive properties need not be transitive. 
Propose that someone be actioned to close this issue using that example as an explanation. 
Issue #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure (10 mins) goal - identify an owner for this issue Next telecon - 10am Boston time, 24th August 2001. 
AOB (5 mins) CLOSE 
Please, no! 
As a reviewer, I'll find it very hard not to glaze over the old text while looking at a merge with the model theory. 
Let's release the model theory as a working draft on its own, with something in the Status about how were considering merging it with the RDF 1.0 spec or whatever. 
We're well overdue to publish *something* (W3C process calls for a publication at least every 3 months; this WG was chartered 30 March and we haven't published yet. 
The Director should be knocking on our door any day now wondering what's up). 
I'm frankly not in the mood to take on the huge task of rewriting (or even reviewing a rewrite) of the RDF 1.0 spec any time soon. 
We're obliged to produce errata. 
We're doing that (sorta; we need to move the relevant stuff from the issues list to the official errata page at some point... soon, please?) 
Errata aren't very exciting/useful to developers, but test cases are. 
I think the way to best share the work we've with the developer community is to make noise around a release of the test cases we've assembled so far. 
Art, Brian, would you be interested to write a 1 or 2 page covering document for the test cases, discussing their relationship to the errata and issues list, to be released as a WD? Anybody? 
And let's release the model theory to make the logic geeks happy; it does address many of the more thorny issues on our issues list. 
And let's release the work we've done on the XML serializtion of RDF as its own WD. (where is that thing? 
I don't see it linked form http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ ... ah... there it is... RDF/XML Syntax Grammar Experiments Dave Beckett (Fri, Jul 20 2001) Let's do that much this month. 
Three WDs by the end of Aug would feel good to me. 
After that (unless somebody produces something sooner), let's do something for the end users: a tutorial, a collection of success-stories/case-studies, something. 
Or maybe organize an RDF users workshop or something. 
Then let's revisit the RDF 1.0 spec; by then, we should be able to cut 60% of the prose: the introductory/motivational stuff, etc. 
Or maybe it gets completely superceded by the model theory and the RDF-in-XML grammar thing. 
(ok, well, we'll have to figure out where reification and collections go. 
My vote is: a separate spec for each.) 
I haven't given much thought to where RDF schema fits in this schedule. 
Salt to taste. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Yes, I'll create a 1-2 page WD for the test cases. 
Art 
This isnt QUITE completed yet, as noted. 
I should squeak in if I get time tonight to work on it. 
Also email feedback already suggests some desireable changes which I will do before *next* week's telecon 
If online means public, I would suggest NOT doing this as the MT has now changed. 
If people think its useful, I could re-do the slides to 
reflect the new model theory. 
Let me know if this is worth doing (it wouldnt take long) 
Done. 
I did that during the F2F . 
There is a note on this topic in the new model theory draft, but I could rewrite it as a separate (short) document. 
I raised this on the DAML telecon on Tuesday but there wasnt time to get proper feedback. 
I should have much more detailed feedback by next week. 
One quick comment: some DAML folk feel that making cycles illegal would be OK only if there was some way to say that two classes were equal. 
Yes, we need to do that. 
Sergey, wanna have lunch some time soon?

It's important that we archive the materials that were presented at the meeting as they were presented at the meeting. 
You're welcome to do that in addition, but not instead. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
It's part of the meeting record: we need to capture a copy of the MT as presented on day 1. 
This will be useful for future historians, biographers etc... 
The .html version I generated during the meeting was at a duff resolution, I'll do another that's legible during my flight back to bristol. 
BTW if my trip home is as delayed as it was last time, I risk missing the meeting. 
If all goes according to schedule I should be back in bristol just in time for the call. 
Dan 
OK, I stand corrected. 
Pat (650)859 6569 w (650)494 3973 h (until September) phayes@ai.uwf.edu 
Pat, that would be just great... 
I seem to have missed the fact that you've been in the Bay Area all this time. 
And damn, I'm leaving for Europe (till mid September) the day after tomorrow. 
Apart of reification, I'd love to go through different application scenarios (like those in the beginning of http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/sergey.txt), and examine the impact of your formalization on application behavior using your help. 
You might have analyzed it already to a certain degree in your document, but I won't be able to look at it closely until September ;( Please let me know until what date you are going to be in the area... Sergey
