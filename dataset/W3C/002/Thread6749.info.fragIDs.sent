<s> I don't believe that in that case it needs to be marked up further.  </s>
<s> with a title, although I would include the abbr element itself: p Internet Engineering Task Force ( abbr IETF /abbr )...  </s>

<s> an acronym is bronounced as a word, where as and abbreviation is pronounced as an initialism or the full term is pronounced: Which would make the following things abbr: IBM, IETF, W3C, etc, XML and the following acronyms (some of these are now more generally thought of as real words): NATO, laser, QANTAS, ANZUS, WCAG (pronounced normally as a word).  </s>
<s> But this comes from Spanish linguists - the support for a difference in english is less clear (maybe becuase there is an official version of Spanish, but none of english), and in the specification of HTML it is non-existent.  </s>

<s> Where is the benefit to include the title attribute?  </s>
<s> Supposing linear reception of a resource, the reader is already aware of what XML stands for, repeating it each time increases document size and may confuse readers if you style abbr[title] differently (to provide a hint, that there is additional information available).  </s>

<s> In this case, we do we use abbreviated forms at all?  </s>
<s> I do agree that marking up abbreviations and acronyms is a good thing, but adding a title attribute may be counterproductive, for example, how does p ... acronym title='Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft' Hapag /acronym -Lloyd abbr class='Initialism' title='Aktiengesellschaft' xml:lang='de' AG /abbr ... /p help general or challanged users, unless they are interested in this company's history and background?  </s>

<s> Well, su[pposing non-linear presentation, or about 80 acronyms more than the seven plus or minus two that I can learn in reading a spec, there is value in being able to query an element for its title.  </s>
<s> And not only for voice readers, who can set the acronym to get pronounced according to what it is, but also to me as a visual suer with a smart browser - the abbr and acronyms can be distinguished, and a mouseover puts the title attribute in the status bar.  </s>
<s> It is possible to go too far.  </s>
<s> marking up radar as an acronym would be a bit odd in today's world, but in W3C specs I regularly find a collection of odd acronyms and abbreviations that I don't recognise, or that I think are something different.  </s>
<s> And for people with (at least some kinds of) dyslexia, keeping track of acronyms can be especially difficult, and being able to have them spoken or presented in full is a big help.  </s>
