<s> Yaron (or anyone), I think I am coufused but... Do we need two PUTs to create a new non-HTML resource: one for attributes headers of the resource and the other for the content of the resource?  </s>
<s> Or the WEBDAV draft excludes non-HTML resources (although it does not explcitly say so)?  </s>
<s> To handle non-HTML resources properly, I think it would be better to transmit meta-information (including attributes) as HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> Because you can create a resource with one PUT.  </s>
<s> The draft says in 2.2.1, "attributes headers may grow to very large sizes and may contain octet data", but I don't understand why we shoudn't send very large headers or if octet data are really needed?  </s>
<s> Also sending HTTP headers in the body of the entities is obviously misuse by definition.  </s>
<s> I think clearly defined methods, such as a method for set attribute values, are better thatn the misuse of (or confusing usage of) existing methods... Also the draft proposes significant additions to URI.  </s>
<s> I think URI should be opaque as discussed in the early time in this maling list (remember the "URL;ver=" discussion?). Actually the draft confuses me - I don't quite understand whether it describes about HTTP headers or HTML head parts.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Kenji  </s>
<s> 1. You need a PUT for every resource you create, HTML or not.  </s>
<s> Attributes are resources, so every attribute you create will require a PUT.  </s>
<s> HTTP Attributes have nothing what so ever to do with HTML. 2. It is not acceptable to have to download every single attribute every time I do a GET.  </s>
<s> The overhead is huge.  </s>
<s> As for abusing the term header, fine, call them attributes.  </s>
<s> Drop the word header.  </s>
<s> An attribute is nothing more than a typed link.  </s>
<s> The semantics of this link is that when a resource with attribute linked resources is manipulated the associated resources are also effected.  </s>
<s> As for manipulating the name space, this is a trade off.  </s>
<s> Performing two gets every time I want to get an attribute, once to get the URI of the attribute and again to retrieve the attribute, is not acceptable.  </s>
<s> Its too big a performance hit.  </s>
<s> Thus we must have a means to refer to an attribute without two lookups.  </s>
<s> The URL kludge is a legitimate way to do that.  </s>
<s> Though I suspect we will change the semantics to use ?  </s>
<s> rather than the " "..." " syntax.  </s>
<s> 3. There are no references in the document to HTML.  </s>
<s> HTML has nothing to do with the document.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> If we have a simple external format for metadata, we can send a document and its metadata together using multipart/related.  </s>
<s> I think we should consider what it takes to make WEBDAV work over email, e.g., where you MAIL an update to the web server as an attachment.  </s>
<s> If we're careful about data formats, this should work as well as using HTTP.  </s>
<s> (This is an argument for tipping the balance toward 'new mime types' rather than 'new method names' since mail really only has POST).  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> I like this idea.  </s>
<s> In fact, I've been experimenting with the idea of using multipart/related in another context to transfer database records.  </s>
<s> My only question is whether the experimental status of the RFC will pose a problem for us.  </s>
<s> If so, what do we need to do?  </s>
<s> Probably not much.  </s>
<s> After all, both SMTP mail and HTTP use the same messaging model(modulo details like Content-Transfer-Encoding, but that shouldn't affect us.)  </s>
<s> Or, as I suggested elsewhere, we could introduce a single media type and use parameters.  </s>
<s> It just seems like we're asking for trouble by introeducing a separate media type for each action we wish to support.  </s>
<s> Even with methods, we could include the method in the RFC-822 header, perhaps as X-WEBDAV-Method: or some such thing.  </s>

<s> The MHTML group has pushed multipart/related into standards track, since they needed it for mailing around HTML documents with the included GIFs and JPEGs.  </s>
<s> There are new versions in the internet drafts directories: From: The IESG iesg-secretary@ietf.org Subject: Last Call: MIME E-mail Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML) to Proposed Standard Reply-to: iesg@ietf.org  </s>
<s> Date: Tue, 5 Nov 1996 07:07:12 PST The IESG has received a request from the MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents Working Group to consider the following three documents for the status of Proposed Standard: 1.

<s> I like this idea too.  </s>
<s> BTW, it seems to me that there is a general consensus on treating attributes (or metadata) as usual resources.  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>
<s> But I have questions about this... 1.  </s>
<s> How to define metadata of metadata?  </s>
<s> For example, if you lock the metadata independently, you have to keep track of lock status of metadata.  </s>
<s> This is an infinite chain.... 2. How to maintain the consistency between contents and their metadata?  </s>
<s> If we handle independently these two, we always have this problem.  </s>
<s> Anyway you need to lock both to modify metadata if you would like to ensure the consistency.  </s>
<s> 3. When is it useful to manipulate the metadata independently from contents?  </s>
<s> At last, metadata are metadata of something.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Kenji  </s>
