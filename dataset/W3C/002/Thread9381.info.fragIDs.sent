<s> (Not strictly a WG topic for now, but I wanted to test my understanding...) In the 28-Aug MT draft, section 4, the reification conditions are described as (V union VxVxV) is a subset of IR x,y is in IEXT(I(rdf:subject)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x= a b c and y=a x,y is in IEXT(I(rdf:predicate)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x= a b c and y=b x,y is in IEXT(I(rdf:object)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x= a b c and y=c  </s>
<s> x is in ICEXT(I(rdf:Statement)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x= a b c  </s>
<s> This seems to say that *every* 3-tuple in VxVxV is of type  </s>
<s> rdf:Statement.  </s>
<s> This appears to preclude the use of the 3-tuple for any other purpose.  </s>
<s> Is this right?  </s>

<s> In VxVxV, yes.  </s>
<s> Not every triple in IRxIRxIR is, of course.  </s>

<s> Er.... .not  </s>

<s> It's probably a red herring.  </s>
<s> But I was wondering what would happen if one wanted, in future, to allow 3-tuples of resources in the domain of interpretation for some purpose other than representing a statement.  </s>
<s> I find it difficult to imagine a useful node that wouldn't be some part of some statement, hence be a member of V.  </s>

<s> I have no trouble at all, eg how about a triple of real numbers, or of pieces of coal, or of plays by Shakespeare, or whatever.  </s>
<s> (They may not be nodes, but they are triples.)  </s>
<s> The things in IR are the entities being denoted, remember, not their URIs.  </s>
<s> Putting V and VxVxV in the domain just says that some of the expressions are counted as things that can be talked about by other expressions, but there are still a hell of a lot of other things that can be talked about and are not expressions, so are not of type rdf:Statement.  </s>
<s> There can be triples in IR already.  </s>
<s> The proposed V-semantics for reification is just a way to be explicit about some of the triples being syntactic in nature, ie in the class rdf:Statement.  </s>

<s> Ah, got it, thanks.  </s>
<s> On first reading, I didn't fully catch the lexical nature of nodes in V. (It was all there, I just didn't read carefully enough.) #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
