This is an excellent draft in general. 
I do have a slight concern with calling an Informational document a 
list of requirements, since the IESG used to frown on such things. 
Jim should probably ask the A.D.'s about whether it should be 
changed to Recommendations. 
The document should at least highlight at the beginning that these are functional requirements for a future protocol, rather than compliance requirements for Internet applications. 
Specific comments: 
5.2.2. 
Rationale One type of link between resources is the hypertext link, which is browsable using a hypertext style point-and-click user interface. 
Links, whether they are browsable hypertext links, or simply a means of capturing a connection between resources, have many purposes. 
Links 
should be "relationship" 
5.3.1.1. 
Independence of locks. 
It must be possible to lock a resource without re-reading the resource, and without committing to editing the 
should be "performing an additional retrieval of" 
5.5.1. 
Functional Requirement The source of any given resource must be retrievable. 
should be "The source of any given resource must be retrievable by 
any principle with authorization to edit the resource." 
5.7.1.2. 
Rationale There are many reasons why a resource might need to be duplicated, such as changing ownership, preparing for major modifications, or making a backup. 
Due to network costs associated with loading and saving a resource, it is far preferable to have a server perform a resource copy than a client. 
If a copied resource records which resource it is a copy of, then it would be possible for a cache to avoid loading the copied resource if it already locally stores the original. 
The entire last sentence needs to be deleted. 
In HTTP, a cache cannot know the authentication requirements that may underly the location of 
the copy destination, and therefore the cache cannot use the new resource 
until a later request verifies that the new location is cachable, which is equivalent to reloading the resource. 
That's it, ....Roy 
Thanks to all who have provided comments on the current requirements draft. 
I will incorporate your suggestions and publish a new draft within the next 
few days.

I agree with Roy and Larry on the issue of "requirements" vs "goals." 
We will probably help reduce our own blood pressure if we change the "requirements" to "goals."

I have made all the changes suggested during the last call period, with the 
exception of changing the name of the document from requirements to recommendations. 
To address Roy's concern that someone could misconstrue the document as a set of compliance requirements on all Internet applications, I would like to do two things: 1. Change the title to "Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web" 2. Change the abstract to say "This document presents a list of features in the form of requirements for a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning protocol which, if implemented, would improve the efficiency of common remote editing operations, etc., etc." Yaron's concern about using the term "requirements" is a different one from Roy's, I think. 
It is more that we don't want to get ourselves into the bind of committing to doing things that turn out to be impossible, because of schedule, resources, or the pure practicalities of implementation. 
I would like to address it by changing the Introduction: 3. Add a disclaimer to the Introduction to make it clear that it may not be possible to satisfy all of these requirements. 
So the last paragraph of the introduction would read: "This document reflects the consensus of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning working group (WebDAV) as to the functionality that should be standardized to support distributed authoring and versioning on the Web. 
As with any set of requirements, practical considerations may make it impossible to satisfy them all. 
It is the intention of the WebDAV working group to come as close as possible to satisfying them in the specifications that make up the WebDAV protocol."

Obviously I will need to read the new version of the document but otherwise, I agree.

Thank you Judith for creating (hopefully) the last draft of this document. 
Once this document has been placed in the Internet-Drafts directory, I will announce the availability of the draft to this working group, and begin a 3 working day last review period. 
At the end of this last review period, unless I have seen vehement objections appear on the list, I will make a call for working group consensus on this document.
