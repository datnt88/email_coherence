<s> This is an excellent draft in general.  </s>
<s> I do have a slight concern with calling an Informational document a  </s>
<s> list of requirements, since the IESG used to frown on such things.  </s>
<s> Jim should probably ask the A.D.'s about whether it should be  </s>

<s> The document should at least highlight at the beginning that these are functional requirements for a future protocol, rather than compliance requirements for Internet applications.  </s>

<s> 5.7.1.2.  </s>
<s> Rationale There are many reasons why a resource might need to be duplicated, such as changing ownership, preparing for major modifications, or making a backup.  </s>
<s> Due to network costs associated with loading and saving a resource, it is far preferable to have a server perform a resource copy than a client.  </s>
<s> If a copied resource records which resource it is a copy of, then it would be possible for a cache to avoid loading the copied resource if it already locally stores the original.  </s>
<s> The entire last sentence needs to be deleted.  </s>
<s> In HTTP, a cache cannot know the authentication requirements that may underly the location of  </s>
<s> the copy destination, and therefore the cache cannot use the new resource  </s>
<s> until a later request verifies that the new location is cachable, which is equivalent to reloading the resource.  </s>

<s> To address Roy's concern that someone could misconstrue the document as a set of compliance requirements on all Internet applications, I would like to do two things: 1. Change the title to "Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web" 2. Change the abstract to say "This document presents a list of features in the form of requirements for a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning protocol which, if implemented, would improve the efficiency of common remote editing operations, etc., etc." Yaron's concern about using the term "requirements" is a different one from Roy's, I think.  </s>
<s> It is more that we don't want to get ourselves into the bind of committing to doing things that turn out to be impossible, because of schedule, resources, or the pure practicalities of implementation.  </s>
<s> I would like to address it by changing the Introduction: 3. Add a disclaimer to the Introduction to make it clear that it may not be possible to satisfy all of these requirements.  </s>
<s> So the last paragraph of the introduction would read: "This document reflects the consensus of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning working group (WebDAV) as to the functionality that should be standardized to support distributed authoring and versioning on the Web.  </s>
<s> As with any set of requirements, practical considerations may make it impossible to satisfy them all.  </s>
<s> It is the intention of the WebDAV working group to come as close as possible to satisfying them in the specifications that make up the WebDAV protocol."  </s>
