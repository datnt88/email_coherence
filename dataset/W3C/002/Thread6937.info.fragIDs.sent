I have a couple of questions about URIs that may have already been discussed or even answered. 
If so, please point me at the archive; but if not, they ought to be. 
The first is about URIs as names. 
Given the contemporary unified understanding of URI's, I gather that it is appropriate to generally consider any URI to be a name, by which I mean an expression which is understood to refer to something; or, as logicians say, to denote it. 
Exactly what a name refers to, and how one can determine what it refers to, are complex questions that might require complex answers, but I want to focus on just one issue that seems to be special to URIs and not arise in other naming schemes (so acutely, in any case.) Although the term 'URL' is now deprecated, the fact remains that the vast majority of URIs in actual use start with http: , https:, or ftp:, and are used primarily as a kind of global file-address. 
That is, they are used by communication protocols to identify a global address on a computer network where some data can be accessed. 
This is the basic traffic of the Web. 
Now, my question is: is there supposed to be any particular relationship between the referent of such a URI, considered as a name, and the file that it locates in the global file network? 
For example, should we say that a URI beginning with http: must *denote* or *refer to* the file itself, or to the web-page image on a screen produced when that file is accessed by a browser (ie the hypertext, rather than the markup that 'describes' it), or perhaps to some other thing that is itself named (in some sense) by that hypertext? 
Or is there some other kind of relationship that should be assumed between the referent and the file? 
(What?) Or can the referent of such a URI be assigned freely, with no reference to the file that it 'points to' in its role as a locator? 
My second question concerns some rather opaque wording in RFC 2396, section 1.1, under 'resource', which reads: The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time. 
Thus, a resource can remain constant even when its content---the entities to which it currently corresponds---changes over time, provided that the conceptual mapping is not changed in the process. 
This seems to imply a three-way distinction with two mappings, rather than the simple two-way name/entity distinction suggested by the term 'resource identifier'. 
A URI identifies (denotes?) a resource, which in turn has some *content* (the entities to which it currently corresponds): URI ----(identifies)---- resource-----(corresponds to)----- entity Apparently the identification mapping is fixed, but the correspondence mapping can change with time. 
Is this a fair understanding of this text? 
If so, the entire notion of a URI simply 
denoting or naming something seems to need re-thinking. 
I request clarification of what this is supposed to mean, with particular reference to the intended distinction between 'resource' and 'entity', and between 'identifies' and 'corresponds to'.

Yes. 
Why? The three way relationship is hardly new or novel: object identifiers / objects / object state scheme variable identifiers / variables / values 
In the HTTP spec 'entity' is used specifically to denote 
a sequence of bytes (with a bit of metadata, like its MIME type). 
Think of 'value' if you like. 
For a longer explanation, see the first part of... 
Unfortunately, the latter parts sorta ramble on... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Not in the context of machine states and programming languages, no. 
In a general-purpose ontological model for all of human knowledge, it does require a little more thought. 
Since (I have been told) a resource can be anything, I am not sure what kind of general notions of 'state' or 'corresponds' can be used in such a very general setting. 
I meant in general. 
This passage is about resources in general, not just http. 
Thanks for the feedback.

Now, my question is: is there supposed to be any particular relationship between the referent of such a URI, considered as a name, and the file that it locates in the global file network? 
This is under heavy debate. 
It is often regarded that the utopian vision of URIs is that they are simply identifiers for resources, and that the resolution characteristics of the URI are something that the user decides. 
TimBL has stated that an HTTP URI is not some magic instruction to open up a TCP connection on port 80 to some server and use the HTTP protocol to retrieve a file, but is instead a generic identifier of which any resolution method can be applied [in the XML 2000 talk]. 
Contrariwise, he states that HTTP URIs necessarily identify generic documents [1]. 
Seems like a contradiction, but really IMO it's just two sides of the same coin, as I shall explain in a minute. 
Roy Fielding has often argued that HTTP URIs identify a range of resources much wider than generic document and data types, and indeed HTTP request codes and work conducted on HTTP-similar protocols such as HTTPS suggest that HTTP URIs do not necessarily identify documents or files. 
The whole field in this regard is subjective. 
It is clear that practically, people expect certain URIs to have a particular context-of-use, that is, in Webpages, as something that can be simply entered into a browser. 
The ambiguity over what a URI identifies comes from the fact that the mapping from the identifier to the resource is decided only by the context of its use. 
Some examples, moving from large scale to small scale [non exhaustive]:- * References the HTTP server of the example.org 
domain * References the concept that is denoted by the network entity (go to example.org for some great widgets!) * References the network entity (as Fred wrote on example.org, 
"widgets are cool") The fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter too much what context an identifier is used for, so long as people understand that identifiers used in different contexts have different levels of persistence (on the above, you'd expect it to always reference the example.org 
HTTP server, nearly always reference the concept that example.org, and perhaps change often enough that citing material from it is a temporary thing). 
When the context of use of an identifier is clear, then they can often be used more effectively and persistently, and that's the thinking behind URNs.
