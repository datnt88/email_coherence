<s> There are some serious bugs in the RDFS closure table in section 6 of the MT WP. See a recent message from Peter Patel-Schneider and my reply, on rdf-logic I will try to get the bugs out and produce a revision as soon as possible (couple of days).  </s>
<s> Along the way I will also fix all the  </s>
<s> little typos and add a wee bit of explanatory prose here and there to prevent the misinterpretations that seem to have been produced.  </s>
<s> One matter that I would like some feedback on is, what to do about rdf:type rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> Since it is syntactically illegal in RDF to write xxx rdf:type rdfs:Literal .  </s>
<s> when xxx is a literal, and since this is false in RDFS if xxx does not denote a literal value, there would seem to be little utility in  </s>
<s> having rdfs:Literal in the language at all, since it is impossible to say anything true about it other than things like rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class .  </s>
<s> which have it in subject position.  </s>
<s> So I decided to simply ignore it.  </s>
<s> However, I didn't actually say that it was being ignored, so Peter was right to slap my wrist about this.  </s>
<s> I am inclined to simply avoid this issue right now by explicitly stating in section 6 that the RDFS analysis simply excludes all mention of rdfs:Literal, with a brief explanation of why and suggestion that this will be revisited in future work.  </s>
<s> If nobody objects strongly to this way of getting out of this problem, I will  </s>
<s> circulate a draft wording soon.  </s>

<s> Well, I'm late with the RDFS tidyup draft for the WG, so as pennance I'll try to do better to sync it with the MT doc, now that there is a MT W3C Tech Report it can cite.  </s>
<s> Nice work BTW, regardless of bugs.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Some random thoughts... (a) it seems that if literals are not to be treated as resources, then rdfs:Literal has no place in the language.  </s>
<s> But the concept that would be represented by ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) still has a place in the model theory - you call it LV, right?  </s>
<s> (b) suppose we were to introduce a new property, say rdf:hasInstance, used to define in ICEXT in a similar way as rdf:type but swapping the positions; i.e. ICEXT(x) = {y | x,y is in IEXT(I(rdf:hasInstance)) } might we not legally say: rdfs:Literal rdf:hasInstance xxx .  </s>
<s> ?? Further, if x and y are both resources we can define an equivalence between x,y is in IEXT(I(rdf:hasInstance)) == y,x is in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) It seems to me that the property rdf:hasInstance is much better matched to the RDF language (that rdf:type), because its rdfs:domain is an rdfs:Class, which is an rdfs:Resource, which is always syntactically valid as the subject of an RDF statement.  </s>
<s> (I'm hesitant to suggest we actually do this, just trying to point out that there might be a reasonable way of using rdfs:Literal in the language.)  </s>
<s> I've no objection.  </s>
<s> Thinking about this has suggested to me that literals should ultimately be resources, and (something whose interpretation is in LV) should be allowed in the subject position of an RDF statement.  </s>
<s> It seems a few "gotchas" in the MT were caused by irregularity at this point.  </s>
<s> But for the time being, I see the goal is to nail our colours firmly to the fence and remain agnostic on this point.  </s>

<s> Hi Graham, thanks for the feedback.  </s>
<s> I concur on all points.  </s>
<s> A quick remark on rdf:Instance; while one could introduce it, there would of course be no way to make sure that it was the inverse of rdf:type on literals....  </s>
<s> Also, I think its not quite right to say that rdfs:Literal has *no* role, since we can legally assert that some URI has a literal value, and that might, I guess, be a useful piece of information.  </s>
<s> But its a pretty small role, for sure.  </s>
