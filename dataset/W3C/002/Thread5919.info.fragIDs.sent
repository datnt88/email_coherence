<s> Here's a case in point.  </s>
<s> On-line banking.  </s>
<s> All messages digitially signed, sent over RM, for all message formats ever used.  </s>
<s> Mandated by banks,  </s>
<s> FDIC, the Global Domination ATM Network, or whoever.  </s>
<s> Doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> There is no complexity in reach agreement it's a done deal.  </s>
<s> DB It's only a done deal because: a) there are dominant networks like Visa and Mastercard that can make it work, and b) they have been working on it for decades.  </s>
<s> The issue is that for Web Services, right now, there is no  </s>
<s> "done deal" and it will be some time before it gets there.  </s>
<s> This means, that we should start thiking about what it takes to help the "deal get done faster".  </s>
<s> /DB The bank also have policies that apply to specific accounts which may be  </s>
<s> FDIC, bank-specific, IRS, BBB whatever.  </s>
<s> I don't care how expensive it is to define these rules because the rules would be defined regardless of which technology we use.  </s>
<s> In fact, they are already defined.  </s>
<s> And I don't care how expensive it is to reach agreement with a million customers because the bank simply publishes it's rules - take it or leave it - and does not try to reach agreement.  </s>
<s> And I don't care if UDDI is trusted or not, because the bank already has mechanisms to make it available securely from a trusted source.  </s>
<s> But, I know that some rules are different from bank to bank (e.g. the cost of a returned check) and some rules are different from account to account within the same bank (e.g. the cost of an overdraft withdrawl).  </s>
<s> And given that the rules are already there, I can select which account to use when/where, if I only know which rules apply to which operation I am about to perform.  </s>
<s> DB People can always make the decision on which service (e.g. a bank account) to use because they can read.  </s>
<s> Computers find it much harder as they don't understand the semantics.  </s>
<s> /DB  </s>
<s> So yes, there is complexity in the world and we haven't solved it.  </s>
<s> And it applies in a lot of cases that like it or not will not be able to use the capbilities we are discussing right now because they already have too many problems reaching agreement.  </s>
<s> And any solution to that problem is outside of this working group.  </s>
<s> But there are too many use cases where it's simply not-a-problem.  </s>
<s> It's not a problem to reach agreement, and it's not a problem to have an unreadable 32-page booklet listing all these rules and policies.  </s>
<s> So now the question is - since as you said the technology is already there - can we capitalize on that?  </s>
<s> If my bank already has a 32-page booklet with rules and regulations, can I just expose some of them as part of it's Web service definition?  </s>
<s> DB You could expose it as part of your WSDL definition.  </s>
<s> However before it could be used, someone else would have to write software that could interpret the semantics of the definition so that it could make an appropriate decision.  </s>
<s> Although this is possible, I don't see it happening unless and until there is some standardization of the semantics around how you describe the rules and regulations as the cost of developing the software for all the different ways of describing the semantics would be prohibitive.  </s>

<s> But if the policy cannot reference the choreography then it becomes a  </s>
<s> useless policy.  </s>
<s> In case of doubt, I am not saying that the choreography should reference the policy, but that the policy should reference the choreography.  </s>
<s> This type of issue the tip of a HUGE iceberg, specifically how do you combine things together.  </s>
<s> Now this is not, IMO, part of the discussion for this group, but to get flexibility in automated systems that is comparable to that which humans can provide, there is a lot of work to be done.  </s>
<s> To illustrate lets take a few examples of the combinations that you might need to consider in order to make a decision on what to do ... 1. Choreographies are only allowed if the messages are digitally signed.  </s>
<s> 2. Business Partners require that messages are digitally signed.  </s>
<s> 3. A partner requires that the messages sent to some, but not all, of the services they offer are digitally signed.  </s>
<s> 4. Repeat the above with some combination of reliable messaging protocol (you can chose your flavor) 5. Repeat the above with different message formats depending on the location in which they are being used, for example you need VAT in europe and sales tax in the US. ... and I haven't even started to consider some of the policy decisions you mentioned earlier such as whether or not international orders are accepted.  </s>
<s> If you think about the number of possible combinations or matches you would have to make in order to realize interoperability is effectively infinite.  </s>
<s> This means that: 1.  </s>
<s> You can't test them all - there are too many 2. The SME's won't implement them all - they can't afford to.  </s>
<s> The only way out of this is to define profiles of sets of accepted standards and policies that apply - unfortunately no one is working on this ... yet.  </s>
<s> David  </s>
<s> Anders Having taken a quick look at the document you attached, it seems to me that really it describes a legal framework that identifies how businesses would interact.  </s>
<s> It does not necessarily specify the detail of how they would interact.  </s>
<s> I am also wondering what your thoughts are about separating agreements into three levels: 1. Technology agreements that cover messaging, technical protocols, security, etc  </s>
<s> 2. Process and data agreements that cover the choreography and data to be used, and  </s>
<s> 3. Business agreements that specify how individual parties will interact.  </s>
<s> I think that technology agreements could be developed that could be used by multiple industries, and process and data agreements could be developed for individual industries and that the Business agreements could link the two together for use in a particular instance.  </s>
<s> Thoughts? David determinism of a Chor description language Dear All, I have been following all the very interesting discussions and work going on in this group for sometime and if time permitted I would have joined.  </s>
<s> The reason I jump in here is that Im leading a effort within UN/CEFACT to look a agreements and contracts in a project called Unified Business Agreements and Contracts , UBAC for short.  </s>
<s> In UBAC we approach electronic collaborations from an agreement point of view, i.e. how do we make global business level agreements electronically interpretable and integrated with varous mechanisms for business collaborations / choreographies ?  </s>
<s> When reading Davids email I realized that we are touching the same problematic areas and It may be if interest to you to know that we exists and were working on the border of profiling business realtionships.  </s>
<s> I have attached a contribution from EDIFICE / RosettaNet / ESIA/EECA that shows a way to legally organize business relations.  </s>
<s> The UBAC project is also going to work with business level artifacts such as commitments, fulfillments of for example payment, delivery.  </s>

<s> DB I think it more likely that the policies will most often apply to services rather than choreographies.  </s>
<s> For example the "no international orders" policy could apply to *all* orders.  </s>
<s> The actual choreography used to place the order is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> /DB  </s>
<s> That's precisely my point.  </s>
<s> I want to find specific services based on the policy.  </s>
<s> For example, if the policy says "no international order" and some service says "I use this policy" and "My country !=  </s>
<s> US", then I would not bother using that service.  </s>
<s> DB Yes there is.  </s>
<s> But it is only really relevant to your internal business process (or orchestration) rather than to the choreography because ultimately only the sender of the order and nobody but the sender of the order can decide whether or not to send the order - it's a private process.  </s>
<s> /DB  </s>
<s> There are a lot of other scenarios like that.  </s>
<s> I don't care how they came to be, I know that they exist, and like Visa and Mastercard are very commonly used.  </s>
<s> So let's support them.  </s>
<s> I agree that we should also help the "deal get done faster".  </s>
<s> But where the agreement problem doesn't exist, why not leverage that?  </s>
<s> Probably not, but my computer can still make selections without having to understand semantics.  </s>
<s> The proposal I made was to name things, so you only need to recognize the names, and that a computer can easily do.  </s>
<s> Not contradicting anything I'm saying.  </s>
<s> I could also make it a property in a UDDI entry and do a search based on that property.  </s>
<s> If only I could have something I could reference ;-) arkin  </s>
<s> The WSD group just started discussing how to integrate RDF into WSDL, and ontologies support should follow.  </s>
<s> So there is already some standardization work happening in this area.  </s>
<s> Of course, only time will tell how effective these semantics technologies are.  </s>

<s> David, see comment inline.  </s>
<s> Yes, the "top" are general provisions which sometime may be difficult or impossible to correctly represent in electronic form other than as text.  </s>
<s> The UBAC work were doing covers simple textual agrement to complext eContracts.  </s>
<s> This with an approach that we start simple with textual clauses and work our way toward semantically rich,executable and computer interpretable agreement components.  </s>
<s> Seems resonable , these are often call technical addendums.  </s>
<s> Seems resonable.  </s>
<s> Seems resonable of you by interact include that parties are obligated to ..., have the right to...., is prohibited from....  </s>
<s> IMHO the leveling approach is often appeling but when used in the context of agreeements, real life more complex than that.  </s>
<s> I like to think in terms of topology or formation.  </s>
<s> I also like to separate agreements from specifications.  </s>
<s> * A specification is a collection specification components that one or more authors have created (possibly with copyright) The authors sign the specification with an "Authenticity of Origin" signature.  </s>
<s> Which means the authors does not obligate themself to use the spec and is not responsible for usage by others.  </s>
<s> * An Agreement contains agreement components and is signed by parties that obligate themself to the semantics specified by the agreement components.  </s>
<s> I believe that desctinctions like these are important othewise we never know what the signature means.  </s>
<s> Reuse almost always involve specifications, even on an industry level.  </s>
<s> So the an agreement topology is the art of relating agreements, specification and parts thereof, ie. references, appendix, include, govern, govern with superiority etc.  </s>
<s> Here I also see benefits from using the notion of Specifciations as containers of components which may or may not be related.  </s>
<s> WSDL is component, Chorograpghy is a components, W3C XML Schema is a component.  </s>
<s> A Choreography is bound (static, dynamically) to a syntax specific InformationSpecification such as XML Schema.  </s>
<s> In terms of who developes what, I think its a political process and all we can do is to facilitate a number of relevant possibilities.  </s>
<s> /anders  </s>
<s> The WSD group just started working on WSDL connections to RDF/OWL.  </s>
<s> During the WSA/WSD combined F2F day last May a presentation (see [1]) was given on OWL and how it could be used in combination with WSDL (by the way, I am a member of WSA, not of WSD, so WSD members on this list can probably give better accounts of WSD group's specific plans in this area).  </s>
<s> At the end of the OWL presentation a few people observed that, given the complexity of OWL and Semantic Web-related technologies, it's probably easier for somebody working on SW to become familiar with WSDL and provide help to the WSD group than the other way around.  </s>
<s> So hopefully something in that area will soon get started.  </s>
<s> The latest WSD thread on the subject can be found at [2].  </s>

<s> Working out how RDF and WSDL work together sounds useful.  </s>
<s> Is this work focusing on the semantics of operations?  </s>
<s> There is also a separate requirement to specify the semantics of XML schema through annotation.  </s>
