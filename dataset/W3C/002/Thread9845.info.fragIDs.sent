<s> 2. Introduction RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  </s>
<s> RDF provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data exchange and follows the W3C design principles of interoperability, evolution, and decentralization.  </s>
<s> While the RDF data model [2] can be serialized in many ways, the W3C has defined the RDF/XML syntax [1] to allow RDF to be serialized in an XML format.  </s>
<s> The application/rdf+xml media type allows RDF consumers to identify RDF/XML documents so that they can be processed properly.  </s>
<s> 3. application/rdf+xml Registration This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [6] MIME media type name: application MIME subtype name: rdf+xml Required parameters: none Optional parameters: charset Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 [4].  </s>
<s> Encoding considerations: Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 [4].  </s>
<s> Security considerations: Security considerations include many of those described in section 10 of RFC 3023 [4] and more, due to the semantic nature of RDF.  </s>
<s> RDF documents may make assertions about anything and it is expected that future work with Digital Signature and "Web Swartz Expires September 24, 2002 [Page 3] Internet-Draft application/rdf+xml March 2002 of Trust" will make it more clear how to build secure RDF systems.  </s>
<s> Interoperability considerations: It is recommended that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] as opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax specification [3].  </s>
<s> Published specification: see RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] and RDF Model Theory [2] (working drafts as of 2002-03) and the older RDF Model and Syntax [3] Applications which use this media type: RDF is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported by a range of Web user agents and authoring tools.  </s>
<s> Additional information: Magic number(s): none Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence "http:// www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify the RDF namespace.  </s>
<s> This will usually be towards the top of the document.  </s>
<s> File extension(s): .rdf  </s>
<s> Macintosh File Type Code(s): "TEXT" For further information: Dan Brickley danbri@w3.org  </s>
<s> RDF Interest Group www-rdf-interest@w3.org  </s>
<s> More information may be found on the RDF website: http:// www.w3.org/RDF/ Intended usage: COMMON Author/Change controller: The RDF specification is a work product of the World Wide Web Consortium.  </s>
<s> The W3C and the W3C RDF Core Working Group have change control over the specification.  </s>
<s> Swartz Expires September 24, 2002 [Page 4] Internet-Draft application/rdf+xml March 2002 4. Fragment Identifiers Section 4.1 of the URI specification [5] notes that the semantics of a fragment identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of the data resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type of the retrieval result.  </s>
<s> However, in RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment identifier does not bear any particular relationship to the thing identified by the URI alone.  </s>
<s> This differs from some readings of the URI specification [5], so attention is recommended when creating new RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.  </s>
<s> The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments  </s>
<s> in an RDF document.  </s>
<s> 5. Historical Considerations This media type was reserved in RFC 3023 [4], saying: RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents  </s>
<s> whose content describes metadata, as defined by [RDF].  </s>
<s> As a format based on XML, RDF documents SHOULD use the '+xml' suffix convention in their MIME content-type identifier.  </s>
<s> However, no content type has yet been registered for RDF and so this media type should not be used until such registration has been completed.  </s>
<s> 6. IANA Considerations This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type, according to the registration template in section 2. 7.

<s> Aaron, thanks for pushing this forward.  </s>
<s> The security considerations section looks a bit risky and imprecise; a flag red enough to attract attention, but having no answers.  </s>
<s> [[The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments in an RDF document.]]  </s>
<s> Is that true?  </s>
<s> Hmmm, we said rdf:ID="foo" was equivalent to rdf:about="#foo".  </s>
<s> Does rdf:ID actually define a fragment in the document?  </s>
<s> Did we mean that to happen with rdf:about too?  </s>
<s> I'd like to see two things:  </s>
<s> o an overview of the ietf process, preferably from someone who has done this before.  </s>
<s> Are we cooked to start this?  </s>
<s> o Your current draft copied to an archive and review by at least two  </s>
<s> members of the WG.  </s>
<s> If we can get volunteers asap, I can put it on the agenda for approval this Friday.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I can put it on the agenda for approval this Friday.  </s>
<s> I meant at our next telecon, which is not this week.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Have a wording suggestion?  </s>
<s> That seemed to be the intention of the older spec, and is certainly what our fragments argument is based on.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Graham can provide this, I've not published an RFC with it before.  </s>
<s> Vaguely it goes something like this: 1. Publish an Internet-Draft 2. If comments, fix them and go back to step 1 3. Get approval from the IESG/Regional Coordinator 4. Have the RFC Editor publish it.  </s>
<s> That was the intent in including it in my last message.  </s>
<s> and review by at least two members of the WG.  </s>
<s> An older draft has been reviewed by Graham and DaveB, this one incorporates the fixes they suggested.  </s>

<s> A last call for a first draft ;-) Aaron, this looks good and I see no reason not to publish it.  </s>
<s> I do have a comment below for consideration, maybe in a later round.  </s>
<s> Brian, in private exchanges I recommended that this be released fairly soon to give the IETF community time to review it and get used to the idea that it's coming.  </s>
<s> Releasing an Internet Draft is a very informal affair -- possibly even less so than releasing a W3C working draft -- so there's no sense of commitment implied.  </s>
<s> As long as nobody's going to be embarassed by the content I see no reason not to publish.  </s>
<s> When it has been published, I would be happy to ask Ned Freed (IETF area director and a leading author of the MIME specs) for advice on how to make sure the (IETF-tree) MIME registration can be approved as soon as possible after our documents are published as recommendations.  </s>
<s> When I reviewed this bit earlier, I didn't stand back far enough.  </s>
<s> What is needed to specify here, I think, is the meaning of a fragment identifier when applied to an RDF document URI, as opposed to one _used_ in an RDF document.  </s>
<s> Maybe something like this?: A fragment identifier applied to an RDF document refers to the RDF resource defined within the document using an rdf:ID attribute whose value is the fragment identifier, or equivalently identified using an rdf:about attribute with the document URI and fragment identifier.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... that's not quite right either: that's what _RDF_ means, but what should a general web rendering engine (not RDF) -- e.g. an ordinary web browser -- do with an identifier http://example.org/somedoc.rdf#fragid  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> Would it be all the statements about the resource thus identified?  </s>
<s> A concatenation of the description elements thus identified, contained in an enclosing rdf:RDF element?  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> In the absence of specific objections, I thought they were rather well drafted by Aaron.  </s>
<s> IETF security considerations aren't always required to solve the security concerns, but make a reasonable attempt at indicating what concerns there may be.  </s>
<s> The IETF process is relatively fluid.  </s>
<s> RFC 2026 is the definitive process document.  </s>
<s> For a MIME type registration, which in this case may be something less than a standards-track RFC, the process is set out in RFC 2048.  </s>
<s> Note that this prtoposed MIME type is in the "IETF tree", which raises the bar compared with some other options, but not too greatly.  </s>
<s> There are two main points to be satisfied: (1) ample opportunity for IETF community review with no killer objections being surfaced, (2) to pass IESG review with no major objections.  </s>
<s> I see nothing in this draft that would cause serious objections to be raised.  </s>
<s> Some IETF people might ask "why, what's the point?"  </s>
<s> but that, IMO, isn't sufficient to block approval.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons I recommend early I-D publication is so we can get maximum opportunity to respond to any objections that may be raised.  </s>
<s> I have reviewed it and think it's fine for initial I-D publication.  </s>
<s> (I have made some comments which I think can be accounted for in further rounds.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> That's pretty much it.  </s>
<s> From step 3, you're somewhat in the hands of the IESG and there is probably a last call of some kind involved.  </s>
<s> Theoretically, it's possible to have an informational RFC published without IESG approval, but since we're after registration in the MIME type "IETF tree" then I don't think that's an option here.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
