<s> I would like to propose the following changes to the Advanced Collections Requirements.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The requirements will use the following terminology and definitions instead of the current indirect / direct references terminology: Client-Side Reference: A reference that must be resolved by the client.  </s>
<s> Any method applied to a Client-Side Reference affects the reference only, not its target.  </s>
<s> To affect the target of a Client-Side reference, the client must resolve the reference and operate directly on its target.  </s>
<s> Server-Side Reference: A reference whose existence is, in general, hidden from the client.  </s>
<s> For the most part, methods applied to a Server-Side Reference affect its target, not the reference itself.  </s>
<s> The server resolves the reference and applies the method to its target.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Roy Fielding has been requesting for some time that we change the terminology.  </s>
<s> This is in part an attempt to satisfy his request.  </s>
<s> In addition, the current requirements document defines a Server-Side Reference as one for which all operations are passed through to its target.  </s>
<s> It is clear from the discussion at IETF 42 that this definition is too strong.  </s>
<s> It was proposed there that DELETE, COPY, and MOVE are not passed through to the target.  </s>
<s> I would like *not* to make a commitment in the requirements about exactly which operations get passed through and which do not, but still express the general intent of Server-Side References.  </s>
<s> For most operations, they give a client the impression that it is operating directly on the target, hiding the existence of the reference from the client.  </s>
<s> 2. The requirements will give the following rationale for supporting both sorts of reference.  </s>
<s> Client-Side References provide the basic benefits desired from referencing: They allow multiple collections, on the same or different servers, to share a single resource, in such a way that any change to the resource will automatically be reflected in the collections that contain it by reference.  </s>
<s> They provide this benefit at very low cost to the server, and with no security implications.  </s>
<s> Server-Side References hide the existence of the reference from the client, thus simplifying for the client operations through the reference, and making them more efficient.  </s>
<s> Fewer round trips are required to accomplish the same task than with Client-Side References.  </s>
<s> Servers already support server-side references, generally through configuration files; exposing this capability through the protocol seems desirable.  </s>

<s> We are still wrestling with the terminology for this distinction.  </s>
<s> I've had objections in private correspondence to Client-Side / Server-Side, because they seem to imply something about the location of the requester that irrelevant to the distinction we are trying to make.  </s>
<s> Here are a couple of other possible pairs of terms:  </s>
<s> Transparent Reference (one that the user agent can see) / Opaque Reference (one that is hidden from the user agent) Visible Reference / Hidden Reference Manual Reference (one that the user agent has to dereference) / Automatic Reference (one that is dereferenced automatically with no action by the user agent needed)  </s>
<s> Or stick with Indirect Reference / Direct Reference  </s>
<s> Any preferences among these, or other suggestions?  </s>

<s> 8*222-5169  </s>
<s> I disagree on this point, actually; in the HTTP conversation, the entity issuing the request is the client by definition, regardless of where that entity is running.  </s>
<s> I still prefer these two, myself; I'd go along with Client-Side/Server-Side, but the others seem too contrived.  </s>

<s> My problem with Indirect Reference / Direct Reference is that an indirect reference in the general terms of computer assembly languages means exactly what WebDAV-AC is calling a Direct Reference, thus reversing the definition of (what used to be) a commonly understood term.  </s>
<s> My preference would be to use terms that correspond to the nature of the resource being defined.  </s>
<s> Oddly enough, the best fit would be redirect reference / indirect reference but I wouldn't be surprised at the confusion that would result from swapping the association of indirect reference.  </s>
<s> That is why I suggested reference / alias since that at least uses two commonly understood names consistently.  </s>
<s> I am not concerned with the precise fit with Apache's config language, since we have many different configuration directives that allow the definition of the conceptual equivalent of aliases.  </s>
<s> Client-Side / Server-Side is a bit confusing since it has more to do with the effect of accessing the resource than the resource itself, though I do prefer it over the current definitions.  </s>
<s> All of these are moving in the wrong direction in terms of understanding the specification.  </s>
<s> I would prefer Reference / Alias over anything that overemphasized information hiding.  </s>
<s> BTW, thanks for organizing the discussion -- it really helps to clarify the issues.  </s>
