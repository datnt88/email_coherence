Hi, I am new to using jTidy. 
I need to clean up a local HTML file saving the result as an XML one. 
Here is my code snippet, I don't see what I am doing wrong. 
Do they have JTidy tutorials? 
Could you help me out with this one? 
THanks //------------- CODE --------------- import org.w3c.tidy.Tidy; import java.io.*; class JTidy00{ private boolean xmlOut = true; public JTidy00(){} public void HTML2XML(String errOutFileName, String azIFlNm, String outFileName){ BufferedInputStream BIS = null; FileOutputStream FOS = null; Tidy tidy = new Tidy(); tidy.setXmlOut(xmlOut); try{ tidy.setErrout(new 
PrintWriter(new FileWriter(errOutFileName), true)); BIS = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(azIFlNm)); FOS = new FileOutputStream(outFileName); // tidy.parse(BIS, 
FOS); tidy.?(BIS, FOS); } catch (IOException IOXcptn) { IOXcptn.printStackTrace(); } finally{ try{ if(BIS != null)BIS.close(); 
if(FOS != null)FOS.close(); 
} catch (IOException IOXcptn){ IOXcptn.printStackTrace(); } public class TestJTidy00{ public static void main( String[] args ){ String errOutFileName, azIFlNm, outFileName; errOutFileName="PrntOut.txt"; azIFlNm = "htmlfile.html"; 
outFileName = "xmlfile.xml"; 
JTidy00 JT = new JTidy00(); JT.HTML2XML(errOutFileName, azIFlNm, outFileName); Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
This looks okay to me at first glance (at least with the tidy.parse() 
call in). 
What makes you think you're doing something wrong?

Well, it did not work. 
The error file is populated with errors but the XML File is not produced.

You'll need to attach the input HTML file and the error file so that we can see what's going on. 
Otherwise, things are just too vague.
