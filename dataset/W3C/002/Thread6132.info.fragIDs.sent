<s> Dear Steve, Nick and all others, Yes, this requirement is (in my opinion) a higher level re-statement of my four requirements, with the proviso that the mechanism used is not always a compensation one and we should not be specifying the mechanism anyway.  </s>
<s> So:  </s>
<s> 1) I would like to see the word 'compensation' replaced with 'outcome' (most general but applicable term that I can currently think of, stepping down a fraction of a level my next choice would be ' confirmation or cancellation') so the requirement would read: 12. Assert when Web Service participants are capable of managing their collaborations in a transactional way, to precisely define the transaction boundaries and the common observable outcome behaviour.  </s>
<s> Coordinate the outcome of the long-lived collaborations, which include multiple, often recursive collaboration units, each with its own business rules and goals  </s>
<s> 2) I see the way I formulated the requirements as expanding on this one in a helpful way to guide those developing the language constructs from the requirements (top down view) and consistent with the currently available mechanisms / protocols we know will need to underlie the language constructs (bottom up view).  </s>

<s> Dear Tony, a comment from the sidebar.  </s>
<s> The comment,recommendation you make is a very relevant one.  </s>
<s> Its is better to use a generic term in this case than a specific one.  </s>
<s> It is possible though to reintroduce compensation by adding a classification schema for outcomes or an outcome ontology.  </s>
<s> There one can add "valuation" (within specific context) of outcomes or the different business path taken.  </s>
<s> Are they positive (happy path,success), negative (compensation, cancelation) or neutral (choice) or ... Some of the ourcomes are legally relevant and some are not and the use of terms must reflect this relevance (somewhere).  </s>
<s> Cancellation of a document exchange may not be same as cancelling an offer.  </s>
