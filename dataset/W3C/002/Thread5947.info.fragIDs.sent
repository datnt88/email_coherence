Cheers Steve T Steve et. al: for those of us who cannot get to the calls (and, probably for those who can as well) it is really helpful to have URIs included in the minutes for actions like this week's: *All: Review requirements document and provide feedback to editors. 
*All: Everyone should read the CSF(critical success factors) part of the WSA spec to understand what it is about. 
Can someone let us know where the latest versions of req documents and a pointer to which version of the WSA document to use? 
I checked the WG home page (public and member) to see if there were pointers, but didn't find them thanks JH

Hi Folks, The most recent version of the WSA requirements doc is always available on the TR page: the reference Monica found below. 
I'm going to update the document soon, but the changes are trivial.
