when you look at a table you see from the browser so why when you write it, it goes has it has a road accident or something, I thought I would spell table in the subject line the HTML way By the way HTML tidy misses the correct order, and would give a ok not only for the correct way but also the logical way From ricE Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.

The specification says 
TFOOT must appear before TBODY within a TABLE definition so that user agents can render the foot before receiving all of the (potentially numerous) rows of data.

OK, but given that the TFOOT will only be displayed UNDER the TBODY, why on earth should the browser want to render it BEFORE the rows of data - numerous or otherwise?

This was fixed recently in the SourceForge version. 
Can you post a same file for a test? 
Other XHTML-related fixes: 1) Tidy will now emit the DOCTYPE statement after the XML declaration (not before), 2) Tidy now respects the --doctype omit config item for -asxhtml. 
To get these fixes, you'll need to pull the code from CVS. 
You can get the details at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy.

The browser may render tables on multiple pages, in which case displaying the TFOOT on each page, and before all table rows have been received, makes sense.
