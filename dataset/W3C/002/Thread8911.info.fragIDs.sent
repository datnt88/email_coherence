<s> Hi, Attached are two hunks of HTML.  </s>
<s> One is a replacement for Section 4.3.1:  </s>
<s> The CanonicalizationMethod Element.  </s>
<s> It adjusts it for the removal of MinimalCanonicalization from the document and has an added security warning about allowing arbitrary CanonicalizationMethod functions.  </s>
<s> The second is a replacement for Section 7.3: Namespace Context and Portable Signatures.  </s>
<s> While I have more or less followed the trend of recent discussion in editing these sections, the more I think about it the more it seems to me that, unless it mandates the implementation of a canonicalization that substantially divorces the canonicalizaed XML from its context, XMLDSIG fails to provide interoperable signatures for protocol applications.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Donald  </s>
<s> What is the proposal?  </s>
<s> That we delay the advancement of the xmldsig spec for the advancement of a "repulsive canonicalization"?  </s>
<s> Getting the interop would probably be relatively easy if there's interest -- while Merlin identified the issue I'm not sure how he or other implementors feel, and some kibitzers such as myself feel that enveloping/detachment is up to the enveloping specification!  </s>
<s> Process wise it would probably take longer, an Informational RFC on the IETF side and a REC on the W3C, just to advance the main spec still.  </s>
<s> In either case, when I'm not sure it's necessary to be REQUIRED and I'd like the spec to advance this month, I'm not keen to see this delay.  </s>
<s> How do other people feel?  </s>
<s> 2. ... While this is simple, it is not, in general, interoperable.  </s>
<s> I don't agree.  </s>
<s> For example, if you have two implementation of an envelope application, if that application specified how to detach the payload they will interoperate perfectly, right?  </s>
<s> 3. The SignedInfo element presents a special problem which distinguishes it from general XML data.  </s>
<s> Due to the sensitivity of SignedInfo, Transform operations over it are not provided, only CanonicalizationMethod, and great care must be taken to only use safe caonicalizations of SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure this is necessary.  </s>
<s> This spec is supposed to be relatively mature and we decided not to do transforms (and this isn't an application has an option for) so I don't see a requirement to introduce that issue.  </s>
<s> 1. This text was "adjusted" for removal of minimal but still needs to speak of what to do for character based canonicalization methods.  </s>
<s> Even though we don't specify one, they can be used and in either case we have to say how the SignedInfo element is presented to that algorithm as characters or nodes.  </s>
<s> 2. On the cautionary NOTE, I think this text is valuable and reminds me of the text found in the processing rules which explains why you should canonicalize your references before validating them as the canonicalization method could've changed them.  </s>
<s> So I made some links between this text.  </s>
<s> 3. (Editorial: Not sure adding "Although technically outside" to the (previously) last paragraph adds anything but verbosity.  </s>
<s> We can lowercase the RECOMMEND if you want.)  </s>

<s> I think there might be some disagreement about what interoperable is meaning here... I agree with Donald that there is a serious issue with composition here, but if you view interoperability narrowly, in that a signature in document X can be verified by several independent implementations, then the problem is not one of interoperability.  </s>
<s> I personally think that it would be highly desirable to be able to define a document format that encapsulates another document format, ie. given a (non-negotiable) document format for app Y that looks like I can define my own schema for app Z that contains such a document as a subelement as in  </s>
<s> and have any signatures in A still be verifiable without having to isolate the A element.  </s>
<s> I would personally call this an interoperability issue, but strictly speaking it is a composition issue, and I'm not sure this type of composition is mandated by the requirements [1] (see #3).  </s>
<s> I'm thinking that A is something like SVG, something generic that many applications might wish to encapsulate.  </s>

<s> Mark, I agree that it would be a useful thing to have.  </s>
<s> However, I think the composing XML applications are going to have to address this issue regardless, and if we do address it as REQUIRED as Don suggested, we're going to have to change the namespace for xlmdsig and take extra time to the Repulsive Canonical XML to REC.  </s>
<s> I'm happy for it to be specified externally, and even reach REC orthogonally (not speaking of Standard since we didn't do that with Canonical XML) but the mandatoriness will be expensive for &amp;dsig; in terms of time and its affect on implementations.  </s>
<s> The question is, do people think it's justified?  </s>

<s> Date: Tue, 12 Jun 2001 15:57:25 -0400  </s>
<s> My words above were not a proposal but an opinion.  </s>
<s> However, to provide a specific proposal, I have produced some HTML which I will post separately.  </s>
<s> I don't see why what could be considered just an important tweak to canonicalization can't just be added to the signature spec as a response to Last Call comments.  </s>
<s> I continue to be very leary of thinking that one can just say "cut out the XML to be canonicalized" to avoid context dependency.  </s>
<s> XML isn't a piece of paper you can apply scissors to.  </s>
<s> Inside an application, XML is a logical structure.  </s>
<s> It may be there is a DOM operation which does this but that means we are saying that to get interoperable signatures for protocol cases, people have to implement the DOM data mode.  </s>
<s> If people happen to have an XPath data model (seemingly reasonable given the references to XPath in XMLDSIG), then the work needed to divorce a node from its context is essentially the same as the additional work needed for produce a context repeling canonicalizaiton.  </s>
<s> And I'm worried that DOM will change towards XPath and someone will find, at some future time, when they rebuild with the latest DOM, signatures work locally and they interoperate fine with themselves and they work fine for documents but when they start trying to interoperate with protocols with other implementations, suddenly some fraction of signatures mysteriously break.  </s>
<s> From my personal point of view, there are approximately three paths: 1. limit the scope of the document so that it does not claim to provide interoperable signatures for applications where context can vary (which is typical of protocol applications) 2. change something so that it does provide such interoperability 3. decide by working group consensus that it's just fine as is and push it through without either of the above...  </s>
<s> 2. ... While this is simple, it is not, in general, interoperable.  </s>
<s> Yes, but the interoperability of specific applications that profile signature does not imply interoperabiilty of signatures.  </s>
<s> Interoperability can mean different things.  </s>
<s> But in the IETF in terms of protocols, it means that you specify the data bits sent between the applications and what those bits mean at each end and it all works.  </s>
<s> If additional out of band agreements are necessary, then those aspects which need such agreements are not interoperable.  </s>
<s> This isn't necessarily bad.  </s>
<s> For example, KeyName isn't interoperable.  </s>
<s> But a signature standard where signature validation isn't interoperable doesn't strike me as very useful.  </s>
<s> There isn't much difference in principle between saying that entities that want to successfully exchange signatures need to agree out of band which signed items are divorced from their context and which aren't (resulting in 2**n possibilities if n things are signed by the Signature) and saying that the entities need to agree out of band on all aspects of canonicalization or agree out of band on all aspects of signature vertification and generation.  </s>
<s> 3. The SignedInfo element presents a special problem which distinguishes it from general XML data.  </s>
<s> Due to the sensitivity of SignedInfo, Transform operations over it are not provided, only CanonicalizationMethod, and great care must be taken to only use safe caonicalizations of SignedInfo.  </s>
<s> If you just want to trim down the verbiage, that's fine.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the above should have been as follows, especially with the addition of material in the CanonicalizationMethod section about why you should only use safe canonicalizations of SignedInfo: "3. Transform operations are not provided for SignedInfo so protection of it from context must be indicated by a CannonicalizationMethod algorithm.  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> Well, there may be character based canonicalizations and its reasonable to say that they take a UTF-8 octet string as input.  </s>
<s> [It continues to be my belief that "character based canonicalization" of SignedInfo is fundamentally wrong and that such applications are not XML applications.  </s>
<s> No particular character string is ever XML within an application, althogh it can be an external representation of XML.  </s>
<s> The XML standard makes it clear that XML within an application is a logical structure which includes inherently unordered sets and the like.  </s>
<s> Applications which do not implement the XML 1.0 standard but instead read in and manipulate SignedInfo as a character string are not, for this facet of their behavior, XML applications.]  </s>
<s> OK, sounds like a good idea.  </s>
<s> I don't really care...  </s>
<s> I suppose it should be lower case.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Donald  </s>
<s> I'm not understanding.  </s>
<s> You can't tweak the meaning of one specification from another.  </s>
<s> We can't say [1] "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315" now means something different.  </s>
<s> [1] means what it means, how would people looking at that spec know that other specs somehow changed it's meaning?  </s>
<s> We can create a new URI and spec such as [2] "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20010723", but if it's a mandatory requirement, we'll have to let it precede xmldsig, and that'll hold us up.  </s>
<s> We can create a new URI under the xmldsig namespace such as xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#excC14N" .  </s>
<s> It's kind of editorially awkward to profile Canonical XML in this way, but it makes sense at least.  </s>
<s> My original concern is that this would necessiate a new namespace.  </s>
<s> But since this addition doesn't break any existing instances or processes, I think we can deal with it just by recycling at Candidate REC, ensuring interop and continuing to use the same namespace.  </s>
<s> This still isn't an option an application has, it's saying, "If we had transforms over SignedInfo, then you could use Transforms.  </s>
<s> But we didn't, so you could use a different canonicalization."  </s>
<s> The latter statement is what is stated by option 2.  </s>
<s> Ok, so I'll leave that bullet in.  </s>
<s> But the text has stated, "should be provided with the octets that represent the well-formed SignedInfo element, from the first character" which doesn't requries those characters to be in UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Are you adovcating we should move it to the octets represented by the UTF-8 encoding of those characters even if the XML document is encoded differently?  </s>
<s> [I also continue to not like character base c14n, but we still need to be clear.]  </s>
