<s> One of the things that 2518 didn't try to do, because it had to finish in finite time, was to specify exactly how a lock owner is shown.  </s>
<s> One of the problems was there was no way to identify users.  </s>
<s> Now that Access control exists, there is a way to identify users, and the problem can be solved much more nicely.  </s>
<s> I suggest we add an element "principal-URL" to the lock properties.  </s>
<s> The element is defined in the Access control specification, but it would appear inside the "lockinfo" element as part of the "lockdiscovery" property.  </s>
<s> This wouldn't interfere with the "owner" element, which already is used by some clients.  </s>
<s> My approach would be to add this to access control, since that will probably get this useful element standardized sooner.  </s>
<s> "A server MUST include the principal-URL element inside the lockinfo element of a lockdiscovery property value, if the LOCK request that created the lock successfully authenticated as a known principal."  </s>

<s> Agreed. Are there any security concerns here?  </s>
<s> The DAV:owner live property is a MUST property as well, so this doesn't seem to be an issue.  </s>

<s> Interoperability problems with some clients may arise when adding an DAV:principal-URL element to the DAV:lockdiscovery property.  </s>
<s> In the case of Microsoft Office2000 (e.g. Word), I noticed that it depends on the *order* of the child elements inside the DAV:activelock element.  </s>
<s> If the DAV:principal-URL element doesn't come *last*, as in the attached sample PROPFIND response, Word doesn't seem to send correctly the Lock-Token: header.  </s>
<s> This occurs,for example, when creating a new resource: the PUT request following the LOCK request (which initially created a lock-null resource) sends Lock-Token:  .  </s>
