<s> I haven't said anything about this because I've been relecutant to criticize a proposal on aesthetic grounds.  </s>
<s> but the idea of using separate media types for each action really bothers me.  </s>
<s> Why don't we introduce a single media type application/webdav and then use a parameter for the specific action, as in application/webdav;action=delete Gregory Woodhouse gjw@wnetc.com home page: http://www.wnetc.com/home.html  </s>

<s> This has been suggested by a number of people and I am starting to like it.  </s>
<s> The only real argument against it is that it makes it more difficult to parse requests.  </s>
<s> If a request is a copy I want to send it to program A but if it is a delete I want to send it to program B. However as I expect we will agree on a compromise to introduce new method names but allow for the use of post and depend on the application/webdav mime type, I think we can make everyone equally unhappy.  </s>
<s> Which, of course, is the definition of compromise.  </s>

<s> As I understand the MIME types specification, this usage doesn't really fit.  </s>
<s> Isn't there some other approach to adding the verbs?  </s>
<s> For example, if I understand the PEP document, we should add a Protocol and use header info.  </s>

<s> It provides for querying for support, and leaves content type alone.  </s>
<s> You would still want to have a way to directly address a version using a URL.  </s>

<s> MIME parameters are normally descriptive of the nature of the content, and don't really express operations.  </s>
<s> What I was thinking of for having actions be expressed as POST was really that the POST-ed data might be multipart/action-request part 1: type = action-description part 2: related data part 3: related data and that you could be backward compatible by supporting forms that used multipart/form-data.  </s>

<s> I wasn't altogether comfortable with application/webdav for the same reasons you state but couldn't think of anything better at the time.  </s>
