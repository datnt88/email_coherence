<s> Most of the specs in which this happens (e.g., XLink, XPointer) are written in XML using the xmlspec DTD and then transformed into HTML using an XSL stylesheet.  </s>
<s> I imagine the extraneous  </s>
<s> markup is being added by the stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the stylesheet could be modified to avoid this sometimes, but given that the authoritative version is the XML and the HTML is generated, I'm a little uncertain what harm is done by the extra markup.  </s>
<s> I'm also aware of some HTML editors that tend to write such extraneous markup for tables which is another reason why I'm wondering.  </s>
<s> and whether we can use divs rather than tables for examples in XML specs.  </s>
<s> Good question.  </s>

<s> Removing the optional elements thead and tbody and the default  </s>
<s> values rowspan="1" colspan="1" would save 9k [1] of file size in the three parts of XML Schema taken together.  </s>

<s> I'd rather leave these in, seems to be cleaner markup than just relying on th to distinguish the head.  </s>
<s> I just looked into this for MathML which uses a slightly modified xml-spec DTD and stylesheets which have diverged but have their origins in Eduardo Gutentag's and James Clark's original xml-spec stylesheets.  </s>
<s> The DTD has rowspan NMTOKEN "1"  </s>
<s> so that after DTD processing every th has a rowspan attribute.  </s>
<s> The stylesheet copies most attributes from the source to the output (as the xmlspec table model is largely similar to HTMLs) The stylesheet could special case this for example.  </s>
<s> (Maybe I'll do that anyway) but an alternative would be for the DTD to declare it as #IMPLIED rather than giving a default.  </s>
