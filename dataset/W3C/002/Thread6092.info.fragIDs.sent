<s> Did you ever get a reply to the letter Martin?  </s>
<s> Dear Diane and John, Congratulations on the formation of the WS BPEL TC in OASIS.  </s>
<s> As co-chairs of the W3C Web Services Choreography working group we understand the efforts that will be involved, and wish you the best of luck.  </s>
<s> We firmly believe that the orchestration/choreography is a big space.  </s>
<s> Furthermore we believe that there is room for non-overlapping specs in this area, that can lead to a family of complimentary languages.  </s>
<s> This will benefit the community and more importantly customers.  </s>
<s> It is our intention to liaise closely with groups in this space in a manner that is constructive and non-intrusive, in order to ensure we can provide maximum benefit to the community and customers.  </s>
<s> With the formation of your group, the WS BPEL TC, and the focus of your groups work we would very much like to pursue a liaison with you.  </s>
<s> In addition the two groups will no doubt have common requirements on other groups such as, for example, the need for end-point references in WSDL 1.2.  </s>
<s> We feel it makes sense to explore theserequirements together and submit them to the appropriate group as one voice, albeit from two groups.  </s>
<s> To further explore possible liaisons and to ensure that we understand how we can be of mutual benefit we cordially invite you to our next face to face meeting on 18-20 June in Chicago.  </s>
<s> We would like you to meet the group, of which we share a considerable overlap in membership, and talk about ways in which we can work together for mutual benefit.  </s>
<s> For the purpose of clarity, we are not requiring you to join the working group to pursue this, merely to attend the face to face meeting as invited guests.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if you are interested and we can forward on registration and logistics information when they become available.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Martin Chapman (Oracle) &amp; Steve Ross-Talbot (Enigmatec) Co-chairs W3C Choreography Working Group  </s>

<s> it's in the W3C member-confidential archive, sorry if that doesn't help you.  </s>
<s> FWIW, I note that this invitation went to the Chairs, as individuals.  </s>
<s> jeff  </s>
<s> Indeed it was sent to the individuals but in their capacity as newly appointed co-chairs.  </s>
<s> I suspect this is why they responded in the way that they did, namely to ceck with the TC members that it is okay for them to attend.  </s>
<s> We tried to make the invitation as open as possible simply because we seek to encourage cooperation in an open manner rather than have any pre-conceived ideas about how it might work.  </s>
<s> We have yet to hear from them because the conference call is not until the 16th and the f2f (theirs) in late May.  </s>
<s> So we shall just have to wait.  </s>
<s> But I am full of hope that common sense will prevail and we shall all (W3C and Oasis) get the result that is required.  </s>
<s> It won't be for lack of openess and for lack trying.  </s>
