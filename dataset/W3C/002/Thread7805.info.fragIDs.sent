<s> In my view, the big benefit from holding it face to face comes from getting a critical mass of WebDAV developers together in the same room, so they could meet each other, exchange tips and ideas, and in general build a stronger community.  </s>
<s> Side benefits come from being able to quickly iterate through a test-fix-test cycle.  </s>
<s> If the event is a success, it could be possible to send out a press release, something along the lines of "Successful DAV interoperability demonstrated".  </s>
<s> But, like the support organization, many of the hurdles to holding such an event are organizational.  </s>
<s> Since this event needs to be vendor-neutral, it typically should be held somewhere that isn't a company facility.  </s>
<s> People need to bring themselves, and some machines in.  </s>
<s> The sponsoring organization needs to arrange for net access, and a network in the room.  </s>
<s> Security is antoher consideration.  </s>
<s> Someone needs to coordinate this activity.  </s>
<s> So, the question is, should we try to hold a face-to-face interoperability event, or should we instead continue with the current online-based testing?  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I think an interoperability test suite would be more useful over a longer period of time, and would accomplish a lot of the same goals.  </s>
<s> If we had a client/server test framework, it would be possible for companies to submit tests to the suite.  </s>
<s> Then other interested parties could run the tests against their products.  </s>
<s> In addition, a test suite is the best way of determining if the protocol is  </s>
<s> complete, consistent, implementable, and in some sense, useful.  </s>
<s> IBM is thinking about creating the basis of such a suite, and would like to make it open-source so others could contribute.  </s>
<s> Again, webdav.org would be the logical place to host  </s>
<s> and deploy it.  </s>

<s> Another important purpose of a bake-off, whether held in a single location or done over a wide area, is to get demonstrable buy-in from the purveyors of clients and servers.  </s>
<s> In the context of a mailing list, it's just too easy for someone to Keep-Their-Mouth-Shut when problems with a particular implementation are mentioned.  </s>
<s> If that happens in the context of a bake-off, the silence or non-participation can in and of itself be interpreted as a statement of intent.  </s>
<s> It's both a cultural and a process difference.  </s>
<s> This is not a hypothetical problem for WebDAV.  </s>

<s> I would hope so--otherwise nobody can tell for certain whether a bug is in their code or in the test suite, so they'll just blame the suite.  </s>
