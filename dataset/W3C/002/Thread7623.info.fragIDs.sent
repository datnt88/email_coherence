<s> I believe that the intent was for the src and dst of a link to be a URL.  </s>
<s> This URL could be: - a specific revision (in which case no versioning resolution is required) - a specific versioned resource (in which case either a workspace or a revision-id could be used to resolve the URL to a particular working resource or revision of the versioned resource) - a versioned resource that is identified by performing version selection on the versioned collections identified by prefixes of the URL (in which case a workspace must be used to resolve the URL to a particular working resource or revision).  </s>

<s> So these, and all other URL references would be resolved in the context of the workspace which would be inherited from the request.  </s>

<s> I don't know DASL that well, but does it support regular expressions in matching strings like SQL? 3) Is there any intention to provide special operations for links?  </s>

<s> Links are properties and may be modified with PROPPATCH.  </s>
<s> You'll have to use PROPFIND first if you need to modify an existing link.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Viktor  </s>
<s> Viktor - for questions about DASL you should write to www-webdav-dasl@w3.org  </s>
<s> I am cc'ing that list with my answers to your questions.  </s>
<s> Yes. The result of a DASL query is a set of property values, it is just as if you did a PROPFIND on the resources that the query selects.  </s>
<s> But maybe that is not what you meant to ask.  </s>
<s> if you meant, "Can I write a query that selects all resources that have a link that is of certain type and whose destination is a certain URL" the answer is no not in the current DASL.  </s>
<s> DASL only allows queries that compare properties to constant string values, it does not provide a way to compare a portion of the XML value of a property.  </s>
<s> It does support a pattern match operator, similar to the LIKE operator of SQL.  </s>
<s> This is not as powerful as a regular expression though.  </s>
<s> thanks for your interest.  </s>
