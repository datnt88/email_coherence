<s> This is a another question regarding Microsoft's webfolders.  </s>
<s> I see that when you create a web folder under WinXP, and you open up the "My Network Places" dialog, you can see your current list of network connections and web folders, along with the URL that is associated with each web folder on your system.  </s>
<s> The URL appears in the "Comments" column of the dialog box if you have the display settings set to "Details" (as opposed to Thumbnails, Tiles, Icons, and List).  </s>
<s> Also, if you right-click on one of your web folders and select "Properties", another dialog box will appear showing the URL as the "Target" of your web folder.  </s>
<s> What APIs are available to get the "Target" or "Comments" strings?  </s>
<s> Or more directly, how do you obtain the URL "programmatically" via a VC++ Win32 API to get the URL of your webfolder.  </s>
<s> I have sample VC++ code that I whipped up that opens that displays the common file dialog.  </s>
<s> If you navigate via the dialog to your web folder, and select a file (for example, a text document), on the return from selecting the file and the closing of the dialog, the path/filename is set to something like c:\Documents and Settings\datuin\Local Setting\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE.5\8X6FOLYF\test[1].txt Now, if I make modifications to this file and want to save the file back to the web folder, I don't know programmatically where/how to put the file back.  </s>
<s> Clearly, I can't just save the file back to the above directory on my PC.  </s>
<s> I have to do a "put" back to the original URL.  </s>
<s> Actually, in my application, I would rather have the user navigate to the web folder using the common file dialog, instead of having them enter in the URL and making my code remember the URL.  </s>
<s> The common file dialog must "somehow" know that the folder the user navigated to is a web folder, right?  </s>
<s> So, all I care about is where (i.e., the URL) the user wants to save (or open) his file.  </s>
<s> Does such an API exist?  </s>
<s> Sorry if this isn't the right forum to ask this question.  </s>
<s> I don't know of a MS-related forum/resource to ask webfolder-related questions.  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated!  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> This is all accessed through the shell COM interfaces.  </s>
<s> To my knowledge, the Webfolders UI is implemented as a shell extension.  </s>
<s> You interact with it like with any other shell extension.  </s>
<s> Nothing specific to Webfolders, except that the target is a URL and not a file.  </s>

<s> From the abstract: "Recent specifications extending the Web Distributed Authoring Protocol (WebDAV) restrict the set of properties returned automatically upon a PROPFIND/allprop request.  </s>
<s> This specification defines a method to add specific properties to the set of properties returned upon PROPFIND/allprop."  </s>

<s> Updated reference to deltaV (now RFC3253).  </s>
<s> Changed examples to explicitly use utf-8 encoding for HTTP content type and XML encoding.  </s>
