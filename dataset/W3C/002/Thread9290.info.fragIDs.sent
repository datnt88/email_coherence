<s> Aaron, You've gone to a lot of effort to provide the minutes in a variety of formats.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, you have omitted the one I find most useful.  </s>
<s> Plain old ordinary text is just great from my point of view.  </s>
<s> The action id's also seem to be missing from the html version.  </s>
<s> In future, please could scribes provide the minutes in the usual plain text format as requested in:  </s>

<s> It's difficult to meet opposing requirements.  </s>
<s> I was asked by Eric Miller to use Dan Connolly's meeting report tools (which I personally think are an excellent approach) which automatically convert RDF minutes into HTML.  </s>
<s> I do not feel it is a valuable use of my time to hand-convert the minutes into another format.  </s>
<s> However, I can point you to a web service I have built to create a textual version of any HTML page: www-archive/2001Jul/att-0012/01-rdfc13Jul.html  </s>
<s> I will be sure to include a textified version when I send out the corrected minutes.  </s>
