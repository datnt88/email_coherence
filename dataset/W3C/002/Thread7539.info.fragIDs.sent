<s> Is there any popular Web Servers implemented WebDAV yet?  </s>
<s> Seems like Netscape Enterprise Server talks about Distributed Authoring and Versioning and Netscape provide classes for accessing Netscape DAV functionality.  </s>
<s> Does Netscape DAV is compatible with WebDAV.  </s>
<s> It seems like the HTTP extension methods are different in Netscape implementation, like GETATTRIBUTES .  </s>

<s> Hi Sajith,  </s>
<s> While I understand that prototype WebDAV servers are being developed by several universities, corporations and research labs, there are currently no publically available web servers which implement the latest WebDAV specification.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I should award a prize to the first compliant, interoperable, client-server pair which uses WebDAV level 2. One prize  </s>
<s> idea is a copy of the WebDAV spec.  </s>
<s> and a pair of scissors (it's not done 'til there's nothing left to cut :-), although I think putting the Design Team in a dunking booth and then giving the developers chances to dunk us might prove to be more of an incentive :-) Yes, Netscape Enterprise Server does have several features which overlap in functionality with WebDAV functionality, as they were developed before the WebDAV effort began in 1996 (there is a link to an early Netscape DA proposal on the WebDAV home page).  </s>
<s> However, engineers from Netscape have been working on the WebDAV specification since November, 1996, and, while I will let list members who work for Netscape speak to Netscape's future plans if they wish, my understanding is they are very supportive of WebDAV.  </s>

<s> And how do you define "interoperable" when there's only one finished implementation?  </s>
