Is there any popular Web Servers implemented WebDAV yet? 
Seems like Netscape Enterprise Server talks about Distributed Authoring and Versioning and Netscape provide classes for accessing Netscape DAV functionality. 
Does Netscape DAV is compatible with WebDAV. 
It seems like the HTTP extension methods are different in Netscape implementation, like GETATTRIBUTES .

Hi Sajith, 
While I understand that prototype WebDAV servers are being developed by several universities, corporations and research labs, there are currently no publically available web servers which implement the latest WebDAV specification. 
Perhaps I should award a prize to the first compliant, interoperable, client-server pair which uses WebDAV level 2. One prize 
idea is a copy of the WebDAV spec. 
and a pair of scissors (it's not done 'til there's nothing left to cut :-), although I think putting the Design Team in a dunking booth and then giving the developers chances to dunk us might prove to be more of an incentive :-) Yes, Netscape Enterprise Server does have several features which overlap in functionality with WebDAV functionality, as they were developed before the WebDAV effort began in 1996 (there is a link to an early Netscape DA proposal on the WebDAV home page). 
However, engineers from Netscape have been working on the WebDAV specification since November, 1996, and, while I will let list members who work for Netscape speak to Netscape's future plans if they wish, my understanding is they are very supportive of WebDAV.

And how do you define "interoperable" when there's only one finished implementation?
