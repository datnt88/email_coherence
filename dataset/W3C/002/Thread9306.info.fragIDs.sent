<s> I was chatting with a colleague to day and the subject of anon resources  </s>
<s> and provenance came up.  </s>
<s> Assume I recieve the following rdf from some source SOURCE, possibly with a  </s>
<s> digital signature:  </s>
<s> If were to represent this in my machine as: gensym:1234 foo:bar "foobar" .  </s>
<s> http://goo foo:bar "foobar" .  </s>
<s> this is not the information that SOURCE signed - SOURCE made no assertion about gensym:1234 .  </s>
<s> We'd have to be able to distinguish between the gensym'd URI and the 'real' one.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Some observations:  </s>
<s> (1) A signature is applied to some particular document or data, not to the  </s>
<s> information it contains or represents.  </s>
<s> (2) Depending on the context in which the signature is applied, it conveys some kind of assurance about the content of the document.  </s>
<s> It may assert that the information represented by the document is true.  </s>
<s> It may convey some different assurance about the document.  </s>
<s> (Joseph Reagle has some thoughts about this: see http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-p3p-profile/ .)  </s>
<s> (3) Ultimately, the assurance conveyed by a signature will apply, I think, to the model theoretic interpretation of the information (in which, I assert, genid's and other identifying forms will not generally be present).  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> Not sure I follow that one, but it is suggesting to me that anon resources must be distinguishable from non-anonymous ones in the model.  </s>
<s> Otherwise the model does not represent what the sender signed.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> In this case, I come to the opposite conclusion.  </s>
<s> I think that in a model, or interpretation, there are just things that are denoted.  </s>
<s> The form of the denotation used in the formal language being  </s>
<s> interpreted (identifiers, variables, position on a piece of paper, etc.) does not generally exist in the domain of interpretation.  </s>
<s> Thus any distinction in the form of denotation is not material in the domain being described.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> Ah - I think thats the first time I've got stung by the ambiguity of the term 'model'.  </s>
<s> I meant to suggest that the datastructure which represents RDF/XML, i.e. the data model, must represent the anonimity, otherwise it is not representing what was in the RDF/XML that was read.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> As I said a while ago, it matters who generates the gensym.  </s>
<s> If SOURCE  </s>
<s> uses an anonymous node (existential quantifier) then indeed you are  </s>
<s> not entitled to replace it with a gensym and say that it represents  </s>
<s> what SOURCE said.  </s>
<s> That is what the logic says also: the step from the  </s>
<s> existential to the skolem form is *not* a valid inference, so you would not be correct in saying that conclusion followed from what SOURCE said.  </s>
<s> However, SOURCE could have replaced his existential with a skolem constant ( a newly generated URI, guaranteed different from  </s>
<s> any other URI anywhere else) and, my claim is, that you would have been told virtually the same content by SOURCE under those circumstances as you would have been by SOURCE telling you his existential.  </s>
<s> (Not quite *exactly* the same, since you would know, in addition to the fact that the thing exists, that SOURCE was using this URI to refer to it.  </s>
<s> But that information wouldnt help you make any inferences about the thing that you couldnt have made from the existential.)  </s>
<s> But indeed, if someone signs a document then it isnt,  </s>
<s> in general, correct to transfer that signature to another document  </s>
<s> that differs even in the slightest respect, so the issue of whether the inferences are valid or not may be irrelevant here.  </s>

<s> Yes. If we have genuinely anonymous nodes then they must be recognisable as such.  </s>
<s> I gather however that this is still an open issue, ie do we have genuinely anonymous nodes in an RDF graph/document, or does 'anonymous' simply mean 'unspecified', so that anonymous nodes have an URI (unique to the document which originated it) but we just don't say what it is ?  </s>
<s> To me, the interesting thing is that the model theory works just as well either way.  </s>
<s> Details coming, hopefully tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Pat (650)859 6569 w (650)494 3973 h (until September) phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
<s> I'm struggling slowly to understand.  </s>
<s> My appologies if I miss the significance of some remarks first time around.  </s>
<s> The syntax clearly allows anonymous resources.  </s>
<s> I think you have just said that a parser, which on receiving RDF/XML containing anon resources, assigned URI's to the anon resources when spitting out the triples would not be representing exactly the information it had as input.  </s>
<s> Are we agreeing on this?  </s>
<s> To represent exactly the information recieved, anon resources must be a part of the model/abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> Yes?  </s>
<s> No?  </s>
<s> Could have, but didn't.  </s>
<s> I suggest the requirement here is that the abstract syntax/model be able to represent *exactly* the information conveyed in the syntax.  </s>
<s> My point here is that the abstract model should be able to represent *exactly* the information that SOURCE intended to sign.  </s>
<s> Any subsequent inferences are the responsibility of the recipient.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> That's the point I'm arguing: I don't think it's the anonymity that must be represented, but the lack of possibility of other knowledge associated with the name.  </s>
<s> (Where I'm interpreting "representing" to mean something like "conveying the same information about the domain of discourse") #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> Brian, You said:  </s>
<s> I think that to "represent exactly the information received" the entire RDF/XML document received must be represented verbatim.  </s>
<s> I don't think we're going there.  </s>
<s> In defining RDF, and in particular its semantics, we are in the process of  </s>
<s> identifying the significant information in a received RDF/XML document.  </s>
<s> We  </s>
<s> are making choices about what constitutes "information received" (guided by the existing XML and RDF M&amp;S specs).  </s>
<s> Signatures present an interesting case, because the most trivial change (e.g. adding or removing a space in an XML comment) changes/invalidates the signature.  </s>
<s> So if we mean to convey the exact meaning of a signature (i.e.  </s>
<s> that a certain key signed a certain sequence of bits) we must keep a copy of the bits (or at least a copy of the digest of the bits that was signed).  </s>
<s> When one takes a signed XML document and interprets it as RDF, I think one needs to make some choices about what it means, which will be some function of: (a) the information conveyed by the bare RDF, and (b) the information conveyed by the signature So suppose I receive a statement: (1) _:exists-X hasProperty Y .  </s>
<s> which is signed Alice.  </s>
<s> Also suppose that I apply Skolemization represent this information: (2) skolem:12345 hasProperty Y .  </s>
<s> where I am certain that nobody will independently use skolem:12345 to represent any resource.  </s>
<s> Now I am not entitled to say that the statement (2) was signed by A, but I might legitimately say that I received some document signed by A whose content was interpreted to mean (2).  </s>
<s> When I sign a cheque, it is a piece of paper that I sign.  </s>
<s> When the cheque is presented for payment, the bank interpret the signature to mean that I have authorized the payment of some amount to some person.  </s>
<s> If someone writes a telephone number in the margin of the check, the exact content of the document is changed, but the authorization conveyed by the signature is not.  </s>
<s> Thus, any signature as well as the signed document need to be interpreted.  </s>
<s> A better cheque-based example might be that some banking transactions no longer require that the original signed document be presented to the payer's bank.  </s>
<s> The signed check can be interpreted into some system, and then transferred electronically to the paying bank.  </s>
<s> Thus, the paying bank receives a different document, but in conveys the same authorization (modulo adequate trust and security mechanisms).  </s>
<s> So when you say:  </s>
<s> I would say that "information ... intended to sign" requires some degree of interpretation.  </s>
<s> How much is a choice to be made.  </s>
<s> #g  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I should have made clear that my hypothesis here is that it is the 'model' that was signed, not the document.  </s>
<s> That was not what I meant.  </s>
<s> Good example.  </s>
<s> You can't say that (2) was signed by A because that is not the statement A sent.  </s>
<s> And the question for me is do we prefer an abstract syntax that allows us to express what A sent to us, or are we happy to loose information in the process of transforming RDF/XML to the abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> I didn't intend that we get hung up on the nature of a signature.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> intent was to try to draw attention to the issue of whether the received  </s>
<s> model is the same information as the sent one.  </s>
<s> I think we've agreed that if the receiver skolemizes, then the information is not the same.  </s>
<s> Consider running the scenario twice and the second time the anon resource gets skolemized to skolem:54321.  </s>
<s> Given (3) skolem:54321 hasProperty Y .  </s>
<s> do (2) and (3) represent the same information.  </s>
<s> If the answer is yes, then you must be treating skolem URI's differently from say URL's.  </s>
<s> If the answer is no, they can't both represent the same information as in (1).  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> This must have been one of the messages my mailer lost, so here is my belated response.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant only to provide the back reference, not to rap your knuckles.  </s>
<s> Yes. It would not be representing EXACTLY the same information, since there is some information just in the use of the new name.  </s>
<s> You can imagine a conversation going like this: A: There is a frog in my sandwich.  </s>
<s> B. OK. Let's call it 'joe', OK? A: OK. Now, there is a small sense in which B has contributed 'information' to the discourse simply by giving the frog a name.  </s>
<s> But its a very small sense.  </s>
<s> Compare with A: A frog I will call 'joe'is in my sandwich.  </s>
<s> B: OK.  </s>
<s> To represent *exactly*, yes.  </s>
<s> But see the section on skolemisation in the revised model theory I send out this morning.  </s>
<s> OK, I agree.  </s>
<s> If the source sends you an existential, then you can skolemise it, but you should not claim that the skolemised form is a valid conclusion from what the source sent you.  </s>
<s> It isn't.  </s>
<s> To illustrate why not, imagine sending it back to the source.  </s>
<s> If you sent back the original, the source could agree that is what it said to you; but if you send it back the skolemised form with the new name, then it has no way to know if the use of that name might not imply all kinds of content that it had not sent you.  </s>
<s> (If you skolemised 'honestly', of course, then it wouldn't, but the source has no way to check that.) However, this really begs the question.  </s>
<s> If we have genuine existentials in the langauge, then indeed we need to be able to distincguish them from uses of names.  </s>
<s> But the issue, seems to me, is whether or not to even have existentials in the language at all.  </s>
<s> We could interpret anaonymous nodes as having 'unknown' URIs, or URI's which are assigned arbitrarily in some non-conflicting way, ie 'dont-care' URIs.  </s>
<s> Then there would be no real existentials in the language at all, so no need for the recipients to be able to make the distinction.  </s>
<s> And, the skolemisation point is, nobody who was making assertions would be any the worse off: they could still all say what they want to say just as well, but they would be using names to say it with.  </s>
<s> I agree entirely.  </s>
<s> The issue is whether we allow people to sign documents that express existentials, or whether we insist that anything that is said, must be said using 'names' of some kind, so that if you want to talk about a frog (even just to say it exists) you have to give it a name.  </s>
<s> It doesn't cramp your style in any serious way, is the point.  </s>
<s> Pat Hayes (650)859 6569 w (650)494 3973 h (until September) phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> But we could interpret anonNodes so that the sender would have , in effect, skolemised, just by treating anonNodes as being in the same category as urirefs.  </s>
<s> The language wouldnt be affected significantly as far as making assertions was concerned, and there would be a few communication advantages.  </s>
<s> Eg if anonNodes really are exisententially quantified, then there is no way to refer to them outside the document in which they occur.  </s>
<s> You can send me the document, but neither you nor I can refer to that thing that exists: eg I can't ask you anything about it.  </s>
<s> If it has a name, I can.  </s>
<s> Eg A: there's a frog in my sandwich.  </s>
<s> B: what color is it?  </s>
<s> We can't do this since we don't have any way to say "it".  </s>
<s> Contrast: A: there's a frog which I will call 'joe' in my sandwich.  </s>
<s> B: what color is joe?  </s>
<s> Right, good example; though I think we have to treat URI's differently from URL's in any case.  </s>
<s> Pat (650)859 6569 w (650)494 3973 h (until September) phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
<s> aside Is this in any sense related to Pierce's concepts of "Firsness", "Secondness" and "Thirdness" (using terms from John Sowa's book on Knowledge Representation, section 2.2, p60)?  </s>
<s> Aaargh.  </s>
<s> I really don't know.  </s>
<s> This is one (of the very few) aspects of Sowa's thinking that seems to be completely off the wall.  </s>
<s> I have had many debates with him about it, some lasting for years.  </s>
<s> Other Peircian scholars seem to have the same obsession with this stuff, sometimes amounting almost to a religious conviction in a kind of Peircian revealed truth.  </s>
<s> Nobody else seems to think it anything more than an embarrassment or a joke, a kind of numerology.  </s>
<s> I have come to the conclusion that there isn't anything in this 'firstness/secondness/thirdness' that is worth talking about at any length, so I won't.  </s>
<s> Taken in isolation, the statements of RDF seem to express ideas at the level of "Secondness" -- relationship between things (and "Firstness" -- types; characteristics inherent in things).  </s>
<s> It seems that a bare statement of a relationship (Secondness) may not be affected by use of an existential or a Skolem, but that you are suggesting here that a statement of mediation (Thirdness) may be sensitive to the difference.  </s>
<s> Well, if I was saying that, I wasn't aware of it :-)  </s>
<s> (I am beginning to wonder if the concept of provenance, or assurance is a "Thirdness" beyond the ability of basic RDF to capture.  </s>
<s> In my attempts to capture such things in RDF, I've invoked ideas like contexts which, in turn, seem to require that statements are mappable to quadruple elements, or triadic predicates.  </s>
<s> I'm still absorbing some of this stuff, so can't fully separate fundamentals from coincidental artefacts.) /aside  </s>
<s> I guess so, though you would only know that if you knew that you had received the whole document since that is where the existentials are quantified (see discussion in the strawdog model theory).  </s>
<s> (unless that already provided constitutes a definite description),  </s>
<s> Right, but it can't in RDF since the definite description uses a universal quantifer.  </s>
<s> (b) when given a constant identifier (which may or may not be a skolem, and the receiver cannot know), then there is a possibility that more information about the resource may be received in the future.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Then my question would be: is this a difference we need to capture?  </s>
<s> Good question.  </s>
<s> Pat (650)859 6569 w (650)494 3973 h (until September) phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
<s> Oooh! A bit of Web heresy there, I think.  </s>
<s> Depending on one's point of view, the typical Web view is something like this: (a) there is no difference between URLs and URIs -- they're just identifiers, or (b) a URL is just a kind of URI that contains some built-in hints about how to use the Web to access the resource it names (e.g., protocol, addressing information), which isn't otherwise semantically significant (for RDF).  </s>
<s> Any way, I think that treating things differently based on a URL/URI distinction is to go on very shaky ground.  </s>
<s> #g  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> I spoke carelessly.  </s>
<s> What I should have said (since URLs are URI's, if for no other reason) is that URL's can be treated in particular ways that may not be applicable to all URI's, and that in RDF we can't assume that any URI is going to be URL-like.  </s>
<s> URLs are a special case; as you say, they contain built-in hints about access, but we can't assume that all URIs have such hints.  </s>

<s> Brian said:  </s>
<s> There are not very many use cases for signing an internal representation instead of the serialized form which is actually transmitted.  </s>
<s> The main concerns people use signatures to address are: 1) Did this come from whom it purports to come from?  </s>
<s> 2) Is this an unaltered version of what they sent?  </s>
<s> Both of these are perfectly well-served by signing the serialized form of a graph.  </s>
<s> Signing internal representations ends up with a lot of problems around canonicalization such as byte order issues, as well as a tendency to restrict optimizations.  </s>
<s> There are some other reasons not to take on the task of signing the 'model', including: 1) insufficient number of WG members who are security experts 2) interference with the chartered XML signatures work (which is the group that does have the security experts) 3) lack of demonstrated needs which can't be met by signing the serialized form of a model.  </s>
