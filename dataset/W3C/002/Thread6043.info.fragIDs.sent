<s> Hi Ugo, Thank you very much and another alternative approach that we would like to see in BPMN (Binary) Collaboration process diagrams is as a self-contained process specification in single pool but defined over say three lanes: two lanes for place activities performed by collaborating roles and a middle lane for a shared space to place intermediate events with global interest (i.e. for two parties).  </s>
<s> This would be somewhat similar approach to the standard pattern of a transaction as in http://infolab.uvt.nl/grnsd/lap2003/dietz.pdf defined by Jan L.G. Dietz (http://is.twi.tudelft.nl/ontwerpen/people/dietz.html)  </s>
