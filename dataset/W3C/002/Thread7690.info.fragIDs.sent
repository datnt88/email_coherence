<s> WebDAV (http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.2/bugs/).  </s>
<s> Known Proxies that do not support DAV - Gauntlet - Inktomi's Traffic-Server  </s>
<s> - Netscape proxy server - Network Application's NetCache.  </s>
<s> Some ISPs have made changes to their configuration of NetCache to bypass known DAV servers - e.g. the Hotmail servers.  </s>
<s> However, this fix won't support all DAV servers, just a fixed list of known servers.  </s>
<s> Note that the workaround for known servers on NetCache may well work on other servers as well, with the same drawbacks.  </s>
