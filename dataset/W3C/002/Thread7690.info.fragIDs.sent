I have heard many reports that some proxy servers prevent WebDAV to public 
servers (driveway.com, 
sharemation, etc.), at least using Microsoft's WebFolders. 
Does anyone have any more information on this? 
(Fixes, lists of 'bad' proxy servers, etc?) 
I actually started collecting some information on this. 
Since I don't have 
testing resources for it, it's only hearsay, but here goes: 
Known Proxies that support DAV - MS Proxy 2.0: Support for DAV is built-in to MS Proxy 2.0. 
- Squid: There is a patch for the Squid proxy server that adds support for 
WebDAV (http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.2/bugs/). 
Known Proxies that do not support DAV - Gauntlet - Inktomi's Traffic-Server 
- Netscape proxy server - Network Application's NetCache. 
Some ISPs have made changes to their configuration of NetCache to bypass known DAV servers - e.g. the Hotmail servers. 
However, this fix won't support all DAV servers, just a fixed list of known servers. 
Note that the workaround for known servers on NetCache may well work on other servers as well, with the same drawbacks.

Apache mod_proxy works fine too. 
IIRC Squid 2.3 will pass through the methods defined in 2518, but will still block methods it doesn't understand.

Would this information be suitable on a page for the webdav.org 
site? 
Might 
even put some pressure on proxy developers to support RFC 2518, and to allow their administrators to name additional methods that should be allowed over HTTP (e.g. so that new advanced collections or DASL commands can be added).

Yes, it definitely has a place there. 
Somebody named Aengus was looking into this back into December, and was going to provide all the information (and a web page). 
Never got the info, though. 
I'll set up a page today or tomorrow and put the information that we have 
on it.

I've put together a page for this: And an item in the Recent News on the site home page. 
Thank you everybody for the info. 
Please send me updates as you discover them.
