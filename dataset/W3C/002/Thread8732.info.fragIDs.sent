Hi all, We are booking for a max of 25 people, which seems to be in excess of the usual attendance for these meetings (which is around 20). 
There will be a continental breakfast and buffet lunch provided. 
A/V equipment = whiteboard, overhead and either a 1024x768 LCD panel or a computer screen projector. 
Also, there has been some interest in getting together for Tea at the Empress. 
If you are coming to the Victoria meeting, and you would like to come to tea at 3:30pm on April 19 (the day before the meeting), could you please send me an email so I can get some idea of how big a booking we will need. 
Thanks, John Boyer Software Development Manager PureEdge Solutions, Inc. (formerly UWI.Com) jboyer@PureEdge.com
