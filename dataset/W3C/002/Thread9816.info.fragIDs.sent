<s> written using xsl:copy as follows: -- 1: Namepaces That Aren't Used Should Be Ignored So applying this to file a_1.xml i.e. rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> We get c_1.xml: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> The very similar a_2.xml: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" is 'copied' to c_2.xml which is identical to c_1.xml  </s>
<s> This is an example of how differences that are not in infoset are ignored by XSLT.  </s>
<s> Now, slightly more to the point, in a_3.xml we have a difference that is in infoset: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> The namespace prefix eg has been replaced by the namespace prefix EG. c_3.xml, the result of copying a_3, is not surprising: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> At this stage, it appears as though changing the namespace prefix has not changed the xml literal (which doesn't use any namespaces!).  </s>
<s> However, a different transform extracts the xml literal from its element and makes it a complete xml document.  </s>
<s> The first two examples (i.e. x_1.xml and x_2.xml) in the zip are foo xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/"/ Whereas the third example (x_3.xml) is: foo xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/"/ NOTE Both namespaces are part of the foo/ element as far as XSLT is concerned, and the namespace prefixes matter.  </s>
<s> Thus as far as xslt is concerned, the xml literals in a_1.xml and a_3.xml are different, even though both are " foo/ " surrounded by identical whitespace.  </s>
<s> OPINION (uncontroversial?) I regard these extracts as illustrating "namespace pollution".  </s>
<s> I think that the two documents a_1.xml and a_3.xml describe the same RDF graph despite the difference between them (prefix "eg" replaced by prefix "EG").  </s>
<s> Moving on to a_4.xml this is: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> If this is our RDF input file, the author may expect that the namespace "eg" is present on the xml literal.  </s>
<s> If you look at the xml (as text) it is indeed there!  </s>
<s> But ... If we xslt copy this we get c_4.xml rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" which is the same as c_1.xml and c_2.xml.  </s>
<s> What has happened is that the data model used by XSLT uses namespace attribtues to compute the namespaces on the elements and then discards them.  </s>
<s> The new namespace declaration does not change the namespaces on that element ("eg" was already in scope) and hence is ignored completely.  </s>
<s> Indeed running the extract transform to get x_4.xml we also get (almost) the same as before: foo xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"/ (note that Saxon has reversed the order of the namespace attributes, this is not in infoset, and should be ignored) However putting the same text string into the context of a_3 we get a_5.xml: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> This one is distinguishable under XSLT from all the others.  </s>
<s> If we look at the "copied" file c_5.xml we see that the extra namespace declaration does not vanish: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/" Moreover looking at the extract file x_5.xml, we see that the literal has more namespaces than previously: foo xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:EG="http://example.org/"/  </s>
<s> My take on these examples is that: - the first three examples are all the same.  </s>
<s> (the first two have identical infoset, the third is identical text).  </s>
<s> - so is the fourth, because XSLT cannot distinguish it from the first.  </s>
<s> - also the fifth is the same as the fourth because the text version is self contained and identical.  </s>
<s> i.e. all the examples (1 to 6) are basically " foo/ " which only refers to the default namespace and so any other namespace declaration is irrelevant!!  </s>
<s> This differs from Infoset which sees the namespace attributes and the namespaces as part of the element content, and from XSLT which doesn't see the namespace attributes but does see *all* the namespaces as part of the element content.  </s>
<s> 2: Use of Exclusive Canonicalization There is only one XML spec that I am aware of which worries in this sort of way about referring to namespaces; ignoring ones that are not used.  </s>
<s> That spec is the exclusive canonicalization spec.  </s>
<s> The key concept is: An element E in a document subset visibly utilizes a namespace declaration, i.e. a namespace prefix P and bound value V, if E or an attribute node in the document subset with parent E has a qualified name in which P is the namespace prefix.  </s>
<s> A similar definition applies for an element E in a document subset that visibly utilizes the default namespace declaration, which occurs if E has no namespace prefix (that is the only new concept in exc-c14n).  </s>
<s> Using this concept we could imagine a statement like: "An xml literal includes the namespaces which are visibly utilized by that literal, and no others."  </s>
<s> or (more strongly) "An xml literal is formed by taking the exclusive canonicalization of the element content."  </s>
<s> Either of these statements would be consistent with all the examples 1 to 6 being of the same literal.  </s>
<s> Note that the examples 4, 5 and 6 in which the original XML has explicit namespace declarations within the xml literal *do not* visibly use those namespaces, and so the namespace declarations are simply ignored.  </s>
<s> I use the transform smaller.xsl in the zip to make the files s_1.xml etc.  </s>
<s> These are like the x_1.xml etc but without the invisible namespaces.  </s>
<s> Two other possibilities other than using at least the concept of visible utilization from exc-c14n are: - follow M&amp;S in *not* addressing the namespace in xml literal issue.  </s>
<s> - do our own thing independent of XML groups.  </s>
<s> I do not see either of these as attractive.  </s>
<s> 3: Difficulties with QNames as Attribute Values Moving on to example 7 a_7.xml:  </s>
<s> rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:q="http://example.org/q" As far as XSLT is concerned the qname in the attribute value is well-formed.  </s>
<s> If we take the extract x_7.xml we see: foo xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:q="http://example.org/q" bar="q:name"/ and the "q" namespace is still around.  </s>
<s> But the rule of ignoring invisible namespaces applies also to the q namespace and so s_7.xml is: Note that even if we use a_8.xml where the namespace is only declared on the xml literal it still is "invisible" by the definition used.  </s>
<s> a_8.xml rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" still shows the following visible part s_8.xml (same as s_7.xml)  </s>
<s> This situation is envisaged by exclusive canonicalization and they have three solutions, all clunky: + the XML must be modified so that use of the namespace prefix involved is visible or + the namespace declarations must appear and be bound to the same values in every context in which the XML will be interpreted or + the prefixes for such namespaces must appear in the InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList a special parameter to list the unusual namespace prefixes which are needed despite being invisible.  </s>
<s> The first one means getting the document author to add q:ignoreMe="please" as an attribute to the element and hoping that it doesn't cause problems.  </s>
<s> The second one would work for a small set of well-known namespace prefixes.  </s>
<s> The third one is the only general purpose solution.  </s>
<s> 4: InclusiveNameSpaces &amp; Attribute Value "Literal" Within RDF/XML unfortunately, the natural way to list these unusual namespace prefixes would be to use additional xmlns declaration.  </s>
<s> This doesn't work if we wish to be XSLT-safe.  </s>
<s> XSLT systematically ignores such declarations which repeat something that is already in scope.  </s>
<s> A good example of a likely case is xmlns:xsd.  </s>
<s> xsd is a prefix that is likely to be defined at the top level, and may occur in a qname in an attribute value in an xml literal in RDF!  </s>
<s> We could list these unusual namespaces using an additional attribute e.g. rdfns:xsd ....  </s>
<s> This suffers from being fairly not backwardly compatible.  </s>
<s> Oh dear, what we could do is decide to add these unusual namespaces after the word Literal within the parseType.  </s>
<s> e.g. a_9.xml rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:q="http://example.org/q" This would identify q as a namespace prefix to be treated unusually, i.e. as always visisble on any element in which it is in scope.  </s>
<s> Thus the xml literal is (the hand-written x_9.xml) foo xmlns:q="http://example.org/q" bar="q:name"/ So there we have it.  </s>
<s> We can prevent namespace pollution using the concept of visible utilization.  </s>
<s> We can allow the unusual namespace use (e.g. qnames as attribute values) by listing the unusual namespaces on the parseType value.  </s>
<s> This is XSLT safe.  </s>
<s> For greater precision, particularly for defining equality, we can specifiy the use of XML canonicalization.  </s>
<s> 5: Comments This message is based around one extreme of the solution space.  </s>
<s> We try and fully specifiy what an xml literal is, and we try and get it right.  </s>
<s> This will give maximum interoperability, at the cost of difficulty for implementors.  </s>
<s> As such I support Eric's remarks: "I strongly vote in favor of preserving comments.  </s>
<s> I have a knee-jerk reaction to deleting any information, and I believe this is what would be expected by content produces that take time to include comments."  </s>
<s> Thus example a_10 is different from a_1 a_10.xml rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" eg:a rdf:parseType="Literal" !-- this comment is part of the literal -- the literal is extracted as s_10.xml a !-- this comment is part of the literal -- 6: A Proposal This proposal is based on maximally specifying the behaviour to minimize interoperability problems, at the expense of requiring work from implementors.  </s>
<s> There is the assumption that the WG wishes to address xml literals that: - use namespaces - use namespaces within attribute values Propose that: - rdf:parseType="Literal" is replaced by rdf:parseType=literal where literal is a list of names starting with the name "Literal" - the value of such literal is the xml literal with string component given by the exclusive canonicalization of the element content.  </s>
<s> - that the c14n used includes comments - that the c14n used uses the second and subsequent names from the value of the rdf:parseType attribute as the InclusiveNameSpace Prefix list parameter to the exclusive c14n algorithm.  </s>
<s> - equality between the string components of xml literals is given by binary equality - close the xml literal issues.  </s>
<s> Moreover, I could be actioned to draft an appendix to the syntax doc showing how minimal RDF implementations that: - do not need equality - (and/or) can assume a complete set of namespaces for xml literals# can be implemented satisfactorily without use of a c14n module.  </s>
<s> 7: What's the other path?  </s>
<s> If the above proposal looks too heavy, I would suggest dropping qnames in attribute values from the level of ambition, and merely trying to not prevent implementations from treating unusual namespaces unusually.  </s>
<s> We would then stick with "Literal" and "Resource" as the only two values of parseType.  </s>
<s> Vagueness is possible about precisely what string is produced.  </s>
<s> A more limited interoperablity could be achieved by concentrating the spec on the equaity of literals.  </s>
<s> I am happy to produce a second proposal based around that path.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> My natural inclination is to think that namespaces explicitly defined in the literal should be preserved... What about a_4.xml?: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" or this: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" foo xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:eg1="http://example1.org/" / or even this: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" foo xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:eg1="http://example1.org/" attr='eg1:qname' / Does the declaration of a namespace within the XML fragment constitute a "visible utilization" of the namespace?  </s>
<s> I see you've addressed this in the following sections, and conclude that the answer is "No": an explicit namespace declaration does not constitute a visible utilization.  </s>
<s> Which, as you point out, creates a problem.  </s>
<s> I'm bothered with all the solutions you propose -- XML schema uses qnames  </s>
<s> in attributes, so I think we'd ignore this at some risk.  </s>
<s> The solution of using rdf:parseType="literal ns1 ns2 ..." doesn't seem to be XSLT-safe.  </s>
<s> I find myself foundering on exactly what it means to be XSLT-safe: it seems that any XSLT solution that naively extracts literal content is likely to fall foul if this goal.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com  </s>
<s> Graham:  </s>
<s> Me too, the alternative is to specify less, and still leave room in which implementations can differ.  </s>
<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> I think XSLT preserves namespace prefixes (except when using the aliasing mechanism).  </s>
<s> Not replying to all this message; but I'm summarising something that I read underlying this:  </s>
<s> Applying XSLT over RDF/XML (or XML) with embedded XML that uses qnames in attribute values can mess things up.  </s>
<s> This is due to RDF's XML syntax not knowing about such things and XSLT and other XML specs using them.  </s>
<s> I don't see how this is an RDF Model question, and I haven't been hearing any large requirement for users for XSLTing lots of RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> If XSLT's design makes it hard to do this particular case, that isn't an issue the RDF Core WG can or should address.  </s>
<s> So I'd reduce your assumptions from: - we want RDF/XML to be processable through XSLT without getting corrupted.  </s>
<s> but it doesn't seem easy to do in certain cases where qnames as attribute values are meaningful in embedded XML inside parseType litearl.  </s>
<s> Sorry, we have no solution at this time.  </s>
<s> I feel we shouldn't over-engineer and require new implementation code in order to address this.  </s>
<s> I definitely support: "dropping qnames in attribute values from the level of ambition, and merely trying to not prevent implementations from treating unusual namespaces unusually" -- Jeremy Note there is a use case for PIs in embedded XML, recently posted to www-rdf-interest Dave  </s>
<s> The other extreme that I see in the possibility space is a proposal like: Propose that: - the exact form of the string value corresponding to any given XML Literal within RDF/XML is implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> - the string value is well-balanced XML that can be inserted as the elment content between two tags: to form an XML document, satisfying both XML and XML Namespaces.  </s>
<s> - taking the exclusive canonicalization of both the original XML Literal in its containing document, and the string value within the dummy " foo /foo " document produce the same character string.  </s>
<s> Equality between xml literals is defined on this basis, but only for the purpose of exercising the test cases.  </s>
<s> - that the canonicalization above is without comments - we create some test cases (e.g. with qnames in attribute values) for which interoperability difficulties may be observed What this means is that implementations must: - preserve all visibly used namespaces - not leave dangling qnames in element tags or attribute names - not leave dangling entity references - preserve whitespace (except in tags) - preserve processing instructions are free to: - ignore or keep comments - use any form of the XML that is Infoset equivalent - include any namespaces (whatsoever) that are not visibly used, e.g. to treat a declaration as a visible use.  </s>
<s> - be written in XSLT, and/or have XSLT preprocessors (not compatible with treating declarations as visible use) - not implement C14N This does not suffer from namespace pollution.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I'm sympathetic to this view.  </s>
<s> However, at least in my mind, my prepared defense for objections to the removal of aboutEach has been that it was a syntactic transform, and there is now a blessed method for doing syntactic transforms on xml - xslt.  </s>
<s> If we are going to say that this is an xslt problem, we should do so being aware that we may be recommending the use of xslt to meet certain needs.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Brian McBride said:  </s>
<s> XSLT over RDF/XML will work for most cases.  </s>
<s> This particular issue is supporting XSLTing RDF/XML with parseType="Literal" where the embedded XML content contains attribute values that are qnames, not URIs and the qname prefixes need to be preserved.  </s>
<s> I consider this not a big problem given the number of clauses in the previous sentence.  </s>
<s> The XSLT expansion of aboutEach should remain dooable based on Jeremys' XSLT work, as far as I know.  </s>
<s> RDF/XML was designed well before qnames in attribute values started to be used in XML formats and we have never promised that it would be preserved.  </s>
<s> We can give best practice, if we decide to go the C14N route, but not much more at this stage, without making too-large changes to the RDF/XML syntax.  </s>
