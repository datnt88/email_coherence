I've downloaded HTML-Tidy released on 8th July 2000 from http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/. I've used a previous version (14th April 1999) and all features were working fine. 
The new one doesn't output the errors to file with the option -f filename . 
If i write the option before the foo.htm, TIDY opens the DOS window, parses the sourse, detects errors, does changes (if -m is active), close the DOS windows and creates a text-file BUT EMPTY even if the htm contains errors. 
If i write the option after the foo.htm, TIDY does the same as above, including the EMPTY text-file, with the difference that the DOS window remains open, showing the end of processed file, with the usual recomandations. 
I use Windows95, but i don't think it matters since the old version of TIDY is working well. 
I keep TIDY versions in different directories and run them with complete path, starting with drive letter. 
Where lies the problem? 
My best wishes.

As reported by several other people, and confirmed by myself, this is a bug introduced into the 8 Jul 00 version of Tidy. 
Fortunately, if you have the source code, the fix is quite simple : tidy.c, 
Line 898 : if (input != null) this should be : if (fp != null) Regards, Terry 
I downloaded the source code for the 8th july version, made the change on line 898, compiled and linked to a new version of tidy.exe but still there is no output to error file. 
So, there should be something wrong somewhere else.

Sorry, I don't what to tell you - that specific fix solved the problem for me on Mac OS. 
Since Dave rewrote that whole piece of code, using "input" and "fp" differently than previously, maybe there is another bug lurking, that affects your platform. 
Regards, Terry 
I get the same under OS/2 warp 3. If you are not into recompiling source code, you can redirect Tidy's error messages to a file, by adding: 2 error.txt 
at the command line. 
Your command line would then look something like this: tidy -config tidy.cfg input.htm 1 output.htm 2 error.txt. 
Cheers, Eddie. 
I will post a new release to fix this, either later today or sometime tomorow.
